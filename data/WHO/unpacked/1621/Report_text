07 April 1999 Disease Outbreak Reported

Influenza A(H9N2) viruses have been identified in two hospitalised children, ages 1 and 4 years, in Hong Kong SAR. One of the children is from Kowloon, and the other from Hong Kong Island. Analysis of specimens sent to the WHO Collaborating Centre for Influenza in London, UK confirmed the viruses as A(H9N2) subtype which appear similar antigenically to swine viruses isolated in Hong Kong SAR in 1998. The children were sent home apparently without any medical complications. Further analysis of the viruses is being carried out at WHO Collaborating Centres in Atlanta, USA and London, UK.
