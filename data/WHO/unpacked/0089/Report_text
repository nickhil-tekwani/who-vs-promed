All contact subjects under follow-up are visited daily for temperature checks.

The epidemiological situation remains stable with no evidence of transmission in Libreville other than the episode which involved a Gabonese physician who flew to South Africa last October. Next week, the team of Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) currently in Libreville will visit the Booué area. WHO Headquarters remains in daily contact with the Ministry of Health of Gabon and is also regularly kept informed of the situation through other channels including the French Cooperation in Libreville, MSF, and the Gabonese Red Cross.
