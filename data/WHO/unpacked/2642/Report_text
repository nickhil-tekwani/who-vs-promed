The Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population has announced a new human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection. The case has been confirmed by the Egyptian Central Public Health Laboratory and by the US Naval Medical Research Unit No.3 (NAMRU-3).

The 3-year-old girl from Aswan Governorate developed symptoms on 22 March and was hospitalised on 24 March where she remains in a stable condition. Investigations indicate a history of contact with backyard poultry. The case is not linked epidemiologically to either of the two recent cases in Aswan Governorate that were announced on 19 March and on 20 March.

Of the 27 cases confirmed to date in Egypt, 13 have been fatal.
