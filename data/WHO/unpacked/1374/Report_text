The Ministry of Public Health in Thailand has confirmed the country’s 24th case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The case, which was fatal, occurred in a 27-year-old man from the central province of Uthai Thani. He developed symptoms on 24 July, was hospitalized on 30 July, and died on 3 August.

Investigation of his source of infection revealed contact with household chickens, which began dying around one week prior to symptom onset.

This is the country’s second case of H5N1 infection, and second fatality, within the past two weeks. Confirmation of these cases follows an 8-month period in which no human cases were reported in the country.

Recent outbreaks in poultry have been officially reported in two provinces, Phichit and Nakhon Phanom, located in the northern and north-eastern parts of the country.
