As of 22 November, WHO has received reports of 53 suspected cases and 23 deaths in the Bafoulabé district of Kayes region.

The mass vaccination campaign in this district has been completed, and 186 553 persons have been immunized, resulting in 95 % vaccination coverage. The 2.2 million doses of yellow fever vaccine provided from the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) emergency stockpile, through the International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Yellow fever Control, are scheduled to arrive on 29 November. These doses will be used to target the population of the 6 other surrounding high risk districts (Kangaba, Kati, Kayes, Kéniéba, Kita and Yanfolila).

The team from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (see previous report) with the addition of an entomologist, has arrived in Mali and will assist the Ministry of Health in responding to the outbreak.
