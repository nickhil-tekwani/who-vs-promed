20 October 2005

The Ministry of Public Health in Thailand has today confirmed its first case of human infection with H5N1 avian influenza since 08 October of last year. The patient, a 48-year old man from Kanchanaburi Province, developed symptoms on 13 October, was hospitalized on 17 October, and died on 19 October.

Authorities have linked his infection to close contact with diseased poultry during slaughter. Poultry outbreaks in several Kanchanaburi villages were reported earlier this month.

Samples from the patient will be sent for further analysis at a WHO reference laboratory.

The man’s 7-year-old son developed respiratory symptoms on 16 October. He had assisted his father with defeathering of the diseased birds. Test results on the child, who is presently hospitalized, are pending.

Since the start of the outbreaks in Asia, Thailand has confirmed 18 cases, of which 13 have been fatal.
