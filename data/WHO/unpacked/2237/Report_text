06 January 1998 Disease Outbreak Reported

An outbreak of cholera was reported in a military camp situated 5 kms. from Kisangani in Haut-Zaire Province. Approximately 800 cases with 54 deaths were recorded from 18 December onwards but it is thought that there may be many more. All the cases so far were in the under-18-years age group which represents two-thirds of the population in this camp. This outbreak is mainly due to the recent heavy rains which caused flooding in the area as well as to poor sanitary conditions. The Provincial Medical Inspector, the government's chief medical officer for diarrhoeal diseases and the WHO Representative have visited the affected area to coordinate aid activities and are working closely with other UN agencies, Medecins Sans Frontieres and the International Committee for the Red Cross who are actively involved in the area.
