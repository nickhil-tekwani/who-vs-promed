02 March 1997 Disease Outbreak Reported

No further cases of Ebola haemorrhagic fever were detected during the 42 days of intensive surveillance and monitoring of contacts since the last patient died on 18 January 1997.

As this represents more than twice the maximum incubation period of the disease, the Gabonese health authorities have now declared the outbreak over. A total of 60 cases and 45 deaths (CFR 75%) were recorded between 13 July 1996 when the first fatal case occurred and 18 January 1997.
