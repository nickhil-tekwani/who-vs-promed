29 September 2008 - More than 54,000 infants and young children have sought medical treatment in relation to the melamine-contaminated dairy products in China, causing kidney stone. Three deaths among infants have been confirmed, more than 13,000 infants are in hospital. Kidney stones in infants are normally very rare.

The World Health Organization has published “Melamine and Cyanuric acid: Toxicity, Preliminary Risk Assessment and Guidance on Levels in Food”. This preliminary guidance was developed to assist national authorities in the decision-making process on deciding possible health concern of melamine levels in food.

This preliminary guidance is proposed as a first pragmatic approach until more data become available which would allow a more detailed assessment.
