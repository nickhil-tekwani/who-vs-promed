As of 13 December 2004, a total of 13 400 cases were reported. Between 1 October and 10 December 2004, 615 severe cases with peritonitis, with or without perforation, including 134 deaths (case fatality rate, 21.8%) have occurred. 5 out of 32 samples tested positive for S. Typhi.

Very poor sanitary conditions and a lack of drinking water have been reported in these areas. A crisis committee has been established to contain the outbreak and is carrying out health education activities and distributing medicine.
