As of 13 November, WHO has received reports of a total of 28 suspected cases and 14 deaths in Kayes region, primarily affecting Bafoulabé district.

The mass vaccination campaign is under way in Bafoulabé district. The Ministry of Health requested an additional 2.2 million doses of yellow fever vaccine and auto-destruct syringes from the International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Yellow fever Control and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI ) will provide the vaccine and syringes from their emergency stockpile. UNICEF is shipping the vaccine which will be used to target the population over 9 months in Bafoulabe and 6 other surrounding districts at high risk (Kangaba, Kati, Kayes, Kéniéba, Kita and Yanfolila).
