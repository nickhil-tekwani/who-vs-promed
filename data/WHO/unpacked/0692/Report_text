29 February 1996 Disease Outbreak Reported

As of 27 February, 24 cases of which 17 were fatal had been reported. Control measures instituted in Gabon by the Ministry of Health and an international medical team appear to be containing the further spread. However, sporadic secondary cases can still be expected. Teams sent to investigate rumours of cases in Djoum on the border between Gabon and Cameroon did not find any case of suspect Ebola haemorrhagic fever. Another team was sent from Brazzaville on 26 February to villages in northern part of Congo for a similar inquiry.
