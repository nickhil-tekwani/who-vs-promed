The Ministry of Health in Egypt has informed WHO of the countryâ€™s 12th case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The patient is an 18-year-old girl from the northern governorate of Minufiyah. She developed symptoms on 5 April and was hospitalized on 11 April. She remains hospitalized in stable condition. As with all other cases in Egypt, her infection has been linked to direct contact with diseased birds.

Samples from the patient tested positive for H5N1 infection in the country's Central Public Health Laboratory and the Cairo-based US Naval Medical Research Unit 3 (NAMRU-3).

Of the 12 cases in Egypt, three have died and four remain hospitalized. Five patients have fully recovered and been discharged from hospital.
