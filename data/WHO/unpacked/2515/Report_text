WHO is aware of media reports that six additional patients infected with H5N1 avian influenza are undergoing treatment in a Hanoi hospital and that a health care worker at the same hospital may also be infected. While these reports have not yet been officially confirmed by national authorities, they appear to be accurate.

WHO is seeking confirmation and further information from the Ministry of Health.
