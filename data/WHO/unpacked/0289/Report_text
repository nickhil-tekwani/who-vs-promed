The Ministry of Health in Viet Nam has confirmed a further case of human infection with H5N1 avian influenza. The case occurred in a 35-year-old man from Hanoi who was hospitalized with respiratory symptoms on 26 October and died on 29 October.

This is the first confirmed case in Viet Nam since late July of this year. Since mid-December 2004, Viet Nam has reported 65 cases, of which 22 were fatal.

The newly confirmed case coincides with a recurrence of outbreaks in poultry.
