WHO is working closely with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other international partners following the issue of health advisories in connection with an air passenger from the USA who travelled to Europe while affected by XDR-TB. CDC is carrying out investigations in line with those recommended in the WHO Tuberculosis and Air Travel Guidelines. The guidelines include measures that should be considered by relevant authorities to limit the risks of transmission of infectious TB.
