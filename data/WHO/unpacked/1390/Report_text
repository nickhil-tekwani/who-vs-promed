15 April 1997 Disease Outbreak Reported

A confirmed cholera outbreak has just been reported in Kasese refugee camp near Kinsangani in Haut-Zaire Province. A WHO team in Kinsangani together with teams from Médecins sans Frontières and UNICEF are currently assisting in the urgent measures required for the control of this outbreak.

Since the beginning of 1997 suspected cholera outbreaks have been reported in several regions of Zaire, particularly Kinshasa and Equateur Provinces. Cholera treatment kits have been sent to Kinshasa and a WHO consultant is visiting the area affected this week.
