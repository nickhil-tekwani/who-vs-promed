As of 5 December, the Kwazulu-Natal Department of Health has reported 6548 cases and 35 deaths since the start of the outbreak in mid-August 2000. There have been no new deaths since 20 November (see previous report). 

The outbreak in Kwazulu-Natal is affecting the following areas: Lower Umfolozi districts which include Ngwelezane and Empangeni, Ulundi, Eshowe/Nkandla areas, Durban, KwaDukuza/Stanger area, Jozini and Ugu Region/South Coast.

All piped and municipal water in Kwazulu-Natal is safe. Only people using water directly from rivers and dams are at risk and if good sanitation and personal hygiene measures are followed, the chances of contracting cholera are negligible to almost impossible.

No special restrictions on travel to and from KwaZulu-Natal are warranted.
