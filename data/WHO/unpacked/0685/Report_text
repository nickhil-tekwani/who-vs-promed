20 May 1997 Disease Outbreak Reported

The 1997 edition of International Travel and Health - Vaccination Requirements and Health Advice is now accessible as hypertext files in English, Spanish and Japanese from the WHO home page on the World Wide Web. These files have been prepared by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Human Resources and Education Technology Development for the Control of Tropical Diseases at the Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy (in English), the Spanish Ministry of Public Health jointly with WHO, Geneva (in Spanish), and by a Non-Governmental Organization, Malaria Network Japan (in Japanese).

The agencies who kindly offered to make International Travel and Health available in English, Spanish and Japanese on the web are solely responsible for translation and the web conversion. The printed publication by WHO, including the revised malaria map (published in Weekly Epidemiological Record No. 13, 28 March 1997), remains the official version. It can be ordered from Distribution and Sales, World Health Organization, CH-1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland (fax. 41-22-791 4857, e-mail: [email protected]) for Sw.fr. 17,00 (US$ 15,30). It is available at a lower price for developing countries.

For the first time a Japanese translation of the International Travel and Health is available. It was published this year by Houken, Tokyo. (ISBN: 4-87954-186-9).
