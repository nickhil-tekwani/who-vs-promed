5 November 2003Disease Outbreak Reported

An epidemic of shigellosis has been confirmed in Central African Republic, with a total of 379 cases and 23 deaths from 16 June to 29 October 2003. The cases are in the regions of Paoua and Bozoum, north west of the capital city, Bangui. Institut Pasteur, Bangui analysed stool samples and confirmed the diagnosis of Shigella dysenteriae type 1, which is sensitive to Acid Nalidixic and Ciprofloxacine.

Médecins sans frontières, Spain and Coopi are supporting the Ministry of Health in containing the epidemic. However, since the affected regions face important population movements as a result of the recent civil war, the control of the epidemic is not straightforward. Migration of people to neighbouring Chad is also cause for concern.
