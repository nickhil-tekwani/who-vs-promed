WHO, along with representatives of La Cooperation Fran¢aise, Médecins Sans Frontières, Médecins du Monde, and the national Red Cross assessed the situation in February. Several areas that needed strengthening to control the outbreak were identified, the foremost being improved personal, domestic and environmental hygiene, including the supply of safe water.
