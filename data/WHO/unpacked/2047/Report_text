19 May 1998 Disease Outbreak Reported

Following reports of a disease outbreak in Sumbawanga District, in the south-eastern part of the country, the Regional Health Authority sent an investigating team to the affected areas - Matai, Sopa and Katete wards. It has been confirmed that the outbreak was caused by a severe form of falciparum malaria. The whole country is experiencing increased numbers of malaria cases and deaths following an abnormally long rainy season. Similar outbreaks have been reported in several other districts (Tanga, Muleba, Korogwe, Handeni and Lushoto) in the last 12 months. Malaria is, however, endemic in the whole country and increasing transmission occurs regularly during this period.
