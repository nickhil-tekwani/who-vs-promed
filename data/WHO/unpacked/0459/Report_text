03 February 1998 Disease Outbreak Reported

The Ministry of Health has informed WHO of 5 laboratory confirmed cases of cholera identified in Beira City, Sofala Province. The poor sanitary conditions in Beira had deteriorated following the storm which affected the central region of the country in January. As Beira is a port city with direct land communication to neighbouring countries, (the "Beira corridor"), the Ministry of Health and WHO advise those countries to strengthen their epidemiological surveillance for early detection of cases and reinforce their preparedness activities.
