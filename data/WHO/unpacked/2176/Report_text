03 June 1996 Disease Outbreak Reported

The Public Health Laboratory Service, UK comments that the current meningococcal season is one of the highest reported in the United Kingdom. It started earlier than usual and the incidence was still quite high during May. The majority of cases were diagnosed meningococcal meningitis Group B but there has been a shift towards more Group C and an upward shift in the age distribution of cases. Therefore, the cases in Mallorca probably reflect the epidemiology in England quite well.

The Spanish authorities have instituted appropriate control measures in Mallorca including information, surveillance and antibiotic therapy. The tourist population in Mallorca is also informed to seek medical advice immediately in case symptoms appear.
