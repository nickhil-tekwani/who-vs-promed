05 July 1996 Disease Outbreak Reported

An outbreak of cholera has been reported which began in April in Bandundu town and surrounding areas in the Region of Bandundu. A total of 821 cases with 179 deaths were reported from mid-April to the end of May. The Minister of Public Health formed a team, including two WHO experts, which visited the affected area. The mission was to confirm the diagnosis, evaluate the epidemiological situation, ensure the local teams were sufficiently trained and to organize and coordinate control activities. Although the epidemic in Bandundu town appears to have been controlled there is still a danger of spread in the surrounding areas along the rivers where water traffic is intense and close contact inevitable.
