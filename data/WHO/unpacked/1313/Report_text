As of 7 February, the Sudanese Federal Ministry of Health has reported a total of 250 cases and 19 deaths of meningococcal disease in Blue Nile (199 cases), Gadaref (22 cases) and Khartoum States (29). Three specimens have been laboratory-confirmed for Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A. The outbreak appears to be decreasing.

The Sudanese Federal Ministry of Health has rapidly responded to the outbreaks and implemented mass vaccination campaigns in the villages affected in Blue Nile and Gadaref States. Reinforcement of surveillance is ongoing. WHO is assisting the Federal Ministry of Health in running a workshop on prevention and control of meningococcal disease.
