WHO is aware of reports of a new laboratory-confirmed case of influenza A/H5 infection in a 42 year-old man from Hanoi. The patient is alive but his older brother, a 45 year-old man from Thai Binh province, fell ill in early January and subsequently died of a respiratory illness. Laboratory tests on the deceased man are reportedly negative for influenza A/H5. WHO is seeking confirmation from the Ministry of Health.

The Ministry of Health is conducting epidemiological investigations into these cases and WHO will keep in close contact with the Ministry of Health over the progress and findings of these investigations.
