13 September 2000 Disease Outbreak Reported

An outbreak of cholera with onset in August 2000 has been reported in the southern, western and northern regions (in the provinces of Kandahar, Badghis and Jawzjan  including Saripul  respectively). To date, 1 604 cases and 19 deaths have been reported. All the samples tested are Vibrio cholerae O1 Ogawa, sensitive to doxycycline and tetracycline. Sensitivity to co-trimoxazole has not yet been tested. The Ministry of Health is responding to the outbreak together with WHO and Médecins sans frontières.

A plan of action has been drawn up to include the provision of essential supplies for case management of cholera and strengthening surveillance of epidemic-prone diseases. WHO is seeking to mobilize funds for its implementation.
