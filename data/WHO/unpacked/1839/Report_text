5 July 2005

On 5 July 2005, 21 new polio cases were confirmed in Indonesia, bringing the total number of cases to 100. Twenty of the new cases are from the province of Banten, and one of the cases is from Lampung province, Sumatra.

The recently confirmed cases in Sumatra and Central Java occurred outside the area where an emergency 'mop-up' campaign was held from 31 May to 2 June, and again on 29 June. Sumatra and Central Java will be included in the next phase of the large-scale immunization campaigns, which will start from August. A large outbreak response immunization targeting 78,000 children aged less than five years was held from 26 June around the case in Central Java.

Prior to this outbreak following an importation, Indonesia has not had a wild poliovirus case since 1995.
