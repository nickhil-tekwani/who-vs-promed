09 August 1999 Disease Outbreak Reported

The cholera outbreak which began in late March has stabilized in the 2 provinces affected, and the number of reported cases has declined considerably during recent weeks. In Antananarivo province, the situation has been less acute than in Mahajanga province. There is a risk that some districts in Mahajanga province (Mahajanga I and II, Marovoay and Mitsinjo) may become endemic. Some cases have also been reported recently in Antsiranana province, Nosy Be district.

Strict control measures were implemented during the early stages of the outbreak, including: care of suspect cases in health centres and hospitals, and treatment of contacts; disinfection and other hygiene measures in treatment centres, as well as in patients' homes; widespread campaigns to educate and inform the public; and epidemiological surveillance.

Notification of cases to WHO and information on the areas infected have been very regular and in conformity with the requirements of the International Health Regulations. It has therefore been possible to give a true picture of the situation, thus avoiding unfounded rumours which could affect trade and tourism in the country.

There is no reason for travellers/tourists to postpone travel to Madagascar as the risk of infection is negligible if basic hygiene measures are taken.
