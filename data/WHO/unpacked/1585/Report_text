03 November 2000 Disease Outbreak Reported

As of 2 November, the Kwazulu-Natal Department of Health has reported 4 270 cases and 32 deaths since the start of the outbreak in mid-August 2000 (see previous report). Further investigation revealed that two of the 33 deaths reported on 26 October were not caused by cholera and since 26 October, one additional death has been reported. The trend towards lower numbers of cases being reported on a daily basis appears to be continuing. 

The outbreak in Kwazulu-Natal is affecting the following areas: Lower Umfolozi districts which include Ngwelezane and Empangeni, Eshowe/Nkandla areas, Durban, KwaDukuza/Stanger area, Jozini and Ugu Region/South Coast.

In addition to implementing control measures, including health education, case management and surveillance and monitoring in the affected areas, discussions are underway between government departments, nongovernmental organizations and the community to see how safe sanitation and a pure water supply can be sustained in areas susceptible to cholera outbreaks in the future.
