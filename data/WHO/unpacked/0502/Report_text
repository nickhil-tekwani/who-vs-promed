18 May 2001 Disease Outbreak Reported

There has been an increase in the number of deaths of poultry from influenza A(H5N1) virus in additional retail live-bird poultry markets (see previous report) in Hong Kong SAR.

As a result, the Government of Hong Kong SAR has announced that all wholesale and retail markets selling chickens will be closed and the birds will be destroyed. Retail outlets for live chickens will remain closed for 4 weeks. Farms with live chickens ready for slaughter will be depopulated within the next two weeks. Importation of chickens from the Mainland has been stopped.

No human cases of influenza A(H5N1) virus have been detected. The strains isolated from the birds differ genetically from the H5N1 virus which caused human disease in 1997. There is no cause for public health concern.
