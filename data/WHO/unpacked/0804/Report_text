19 August 1998 Disease Outbreak Reported

In addition to the seasonal pattern of cholera in this region, extremely heavy rainfalls and floods this year have contributed to an increase in both cholera cases and deaths as well as an increased risk of waterborne epidemics in general. WHO is concerned about this situation and, through its regional offices, has alerted Ministries of Health in the region to strengthen cholera preparedness activities including keeping stocks of medicine in reserve, training, health education and setting up cholera task forces, in collaboration with agencies already in place .
