WHO has received reports from the Federal Ministry of Health in Nigeria of a total number of 1616 cases and 126 deaths. Kano State reported 1316 cases and 76 deaths (case fatality rate, 5.8%) from 15 October to 23 November 2004 and Edo State reported 300 cases and 50 deaths (case fatality rate 16.7%) from 16 September to 18 November 2004. In both states, Vibrio cholerae has been laboratory confirmed.

In Kano State, 20 local government areas have been affected with the case fatality rate highest among those less than 2 years of age and over 60 years of age. While there are widespread water shortages in metropolitan local government areas, many of the water sources that do exist are not safe.

WHO has assisted the Federal Ministry of Health with surveillance activities and supplies of anti-sera. Médecins sans Frontières has also been assisting control efforts in Edo State. Cases appear to be decreasing in both states.
