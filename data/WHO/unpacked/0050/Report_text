13 September 2002 Disease Outbreak Reported

As of 1 September 2002 WHO has received reports of 661 cases of cholera in Montserado County. The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare met with WHO, UNICEF, Médecins sans Frontières (MSF Belgium ) and other nongovernmental organizations to discuss measures to contain the outbreak. As a result, a team from the Ministry of Health and WHO assessed the epidemiological situation in the county, including the camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs).

The team recommended chlorinating of water in and around Monrovia as well as in the IDP camps. Community-based health promotion activities in the affected areas were also recommended.
