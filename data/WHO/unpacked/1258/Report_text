25 August 2005

As of 23 August, 7 cases of polio have been reported. Five provinces have been affected: Bengo, Benguela, Luanda, Lunda Sul, Moxico. The most recent case, in Benguela, had an onset of 12 July. This case occurred before the first National Immunization Day (NID) campaign on 29 July.

A second NID will be held tomorrow, 26 August. In order to ensure rapid interruption of the virus transmission in Angola, a third round of NIDs has been planned for late September 2005. The partners in the Polio Eradication Initiative in Angola have asked the international community for financial support to help them carry out this campaign.
