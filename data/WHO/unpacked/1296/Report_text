The Ministry of Health in Indonesia has confirmed the countryâ€™s 56th case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus.

The case occurred in a 17-year-old female from Jakarta Province. She developed symptoms on 28 July, was hospitalized on 4 August, and died on 8 August.

An investigation into her source of infection found that pet pigeons were kept inside her home and that several neighbouring households maintained flocks of backyard poultry. Animal health authorities have collected samples from birds in the neighbourhood and these will be tested as part of the continuing investigation.

Of the 56 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 44 have been fatal.
