30 April 1999 Disease Outbreak Reported

A total of 7860 cases with 233 deaths has been reported since the beginning of the current epidemic which started in December 1998. Areas where cases were still being registered at the end of March and first half of April are Mogadishu, Kismayo, and Baidoa. The disease is still appearing in new areas - Bay, Lower Shabelle, Upper and Lower Juba - which are difficult to access and figures are not available.

WHO is continuing to make supplies available and supporting the health authorities in strengthening cholera preparedness plans since more outbreaks are expected later in the year following the seasonal pattern.
