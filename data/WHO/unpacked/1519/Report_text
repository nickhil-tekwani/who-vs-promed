07 February 1997 Disease Outbreak Reported

In the outbreak of meningitis which started in November 1997, 1,235 cases with 151 deaths (CFR 60.4%) had occurred up to 3 February.

On 7 February, an interagency appeal was issued to raise over US$ 6 million needed to respond to the threat of epidemic meningitis in countries at risk in the African continent. The agencies behind the appeal are WHO, UNICEF, Médecins Sans Frontières, and the Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. The appeal is to establish a fund that will ensure the purchase and distribution of vaccine, antibiotics and autodestructible injection material for treatment during the 1997 meningitis season in Africa (see also Press Release WHO/11 of 5 February). WHO has advanced US$ 1 million to ensure the availability of vaccine pending the outcome of the Appeal.
