05 December 2000 Disease Outbreak Reported

The death from Ebola of Dr. Matthew Lukwiya, Medical Superintendent of Lacor Hospital, Gulu District, has been announced by the Uganda Ministry of Health. Dr. Lukwiya had been involved in the fight to control the outbreak from its first recognition, helped create one of the 2 isolation units, and committed much energy, enthusiasm and hospital resources to its support. He was an inspirational physician and leader; his death will be keenly felt by hospital staff, other colleagues, and the large community served by Lacor Hospital. Dr Lukwiya may have been exposed to infected body fluids through his work on the isolation unit. These circumstances are being investigated by the Ministry of Health.

As of 5 December the Ugandan Ministry of Health has reported cumulative figures for all affected districts of 370 cases and 140 deaths. This figure includes 16 new confirmed cases in Gulu district and 9 new confirmed cases and 5 deaths in Masindi district. It may be noted that the total number of deaths given is the same as that given in their previous report due to the inadvertent duplication in reporting of 7 cases.
