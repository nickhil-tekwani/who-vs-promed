22 January 2008

Human cases of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in Sudan have decreased continuously in recent weeks. As of 15 January 2008, a cumulative total of 698 cases, including 222 deaths, has been reported from six states (Gazeera, Kassala, Khartoum, River Nile, Sinnar and White Nile), yielding an overall CFR of 31.8%.

While active surveillance continues in all affected states, no new cases have been reported since 5 January. Only Gazeera state has reported cases with date of onset in 2008, while several additional cases have been reported retrospectively with date of onset in November or December 2007. Several of the newly added cases evidence ocular presentation, which is typically a late-occurring feature of RVF infection.

Case management related interventions and health education and vector control efforts are continuing. WHO continues to support the Sudan Ministry of Health in preparedness for viral haemorrhagic fever and other seasonal outbreaks and in the procurement of essential supplies, enhancing surveillance and training activities.
