18 November 1999 Disease Outbreak Reported

Following a trade fair in Kapellen, Belgium, an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease has been reported. So far, out of 80 persons who developed clinical symptoms, 13 had positive urinary tests including 4 who died.

Over 60.000 visitors attended the fair, and initial investigation suggests that whirlpool baths exhibited at the show are the most likely origin of the infection. The trade fair took place between 29 October and 7 November, 1999. The investigation by the health authorities is in progress.
