25 April 2002 Disease Outbreak Reported

The Greek Ministry of Health and Welfare has reported 39 cases including 3 deaths of respiratory infection with pericarditis and/or myocarditis between 1 March and 24 April.

These cases have been reported as a result of a new surveillance activity that was instituted on 18 April because of the 3 deaths which occurred in early April. Three university laboratories and the Hellenic Pasteur Institute in Greece are carrying out laboratory analysis of specimens and the health authorities are conducting epidemiological investigations. The Greek Ministry of Health has provided instructions on personal hygiene and as a precautionary measure closed all schools for 3 days.

WHO recommends no special restrictions on travel or trade to or from Greece.
