10 February 1998 Disease Outbreak Reported

The outbreak which began in the port city of Beira two weeks ago has increased dramatically and around 2000 cases with 109 deaths had occurred up to 9 February according to reports from the national health authorities. Strict control measures are being implemented by the Ministry of Health in cooperation with other health organizations but are hampered by the very poor sanitary conditions prevailing in the city.
