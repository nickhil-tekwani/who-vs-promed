29 June 2001 Disease Outbreak Reported

As of 26 June, WHO has reported 69 suspected cases, out of which 6 have died. Of these, 18 are confirmed CCHF (15 laboratory and 3 clinical/epidemiological grounds). Thirty-four are laboratory negative and 17 are still under investigation. 

WHO Kosovo continues to support the epidemic response committee managing the outbreak, assisted by partners in the Glbal Outbreak Alert and Response Network: the WHO Collaborating Centre for Arbovirus and Haemorrhagic Fever Reference and Research in Ljubljana, Slovenia, is providing laboratory support; and a clinician with specific expertise in hospital infection control from the North Manchester General Hospital, Department of Infectious Diseases, United Kingdom, is helping to strengthen procedures at the isolation unit.

In response to a WHO request from partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network for epidemiology support to the Institute of Public Health, Kosovo, two Canadian field epidemiologists from Health Canada will be assisting the Institute with data management in the CCHF outbreak. Their assistance is supported by the Canadian Public Health Association and the Canadian International Development Agency.
