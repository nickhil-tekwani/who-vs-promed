The overall weekly number of reported cases is decreasing in the camps but not in the neighbouring villages around Goz Amer camp.

The team from the Global Task Force on Cholera Control working in eastern Chad (see report) will be following up with the implementation of the water and sanitation recommendations, including the systematic chlorination of all water points, increasing soap distribution and social mobilization and health education activities.
