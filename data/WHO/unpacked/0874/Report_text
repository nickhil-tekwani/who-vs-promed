02 May 2000 Disease Outbreak Reported

From 1 January to 21 April 2000, 2 232 cases of cholera and 230 deaths have been reported. Cases have been confirmed in Bay, Lower Juba, Lower Shabelle, Mogadishu and Mudug. In areas where international teams are present, the case-fatality rate is lower due to effective case management and the implementation of adequate control measures. It should be noted however that cholera control in Somalia is complex and difficult as a result of problems of security, accessibility and the recent drought.

WHO continues to carry out cholera control coordination activities through the cholera task force, which collects and compiles data to be shared with partners, assists in processing stool samples, provides cholera supplies as required and gives training support. Agencies involved include: UNICEF, Action internationale contre la faim, the International Medical Corps, Médecins sans frontières, the Coordinating Committee of the Organization for Voluntary Services and the Somali Red Crescent Society.
