Reports have been received of two travellers to the Amazone region in Brazil who died from yellow fever after their return to their respective home countries, Switzerland (April 1996) and the USA (August 1996). Neither had been vaccinated against yellow fever. These incidents show how important it is for travellers to yellow fever endemic zones to be vaccinated. As stated in the International Travel and Health, Brazil recommends vaccination for travellers to rural areas in Acre, Amap, Amazonas, Gois, Maranho, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Par, Rondnia and Roraima States. Further advice on yellow fever vaccination and endemic areas are available in International Travel and Health which is updated annually and now accessible on World Wide Web.
