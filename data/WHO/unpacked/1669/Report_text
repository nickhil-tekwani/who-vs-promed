15 June 2005

On 15 June 2005, seven new polio cases were confirmed in Indonesia, bringing the total number of cases to 46. Two of these cases are from the same district as the index case (Sukabumi district), and five are from a neighbouring district (Bogor and Lebak districts). The most recent of these new cases had onset of paralysis on 22 May, prior to the immunization 'mop-up' campaign held on 31 May to 2 June.

On 31 May to 2 June, a polio immunization 'mop-up' campaign was conducted, covering West Java, Banten and Jakarta provinces, to reach 6.4 million children under the age of five years. Planning for the second round campaign (to be held on 28-29 June) has begun.
