13 September 2001 Disease Outbreak Reported

As of 12 September, the Ministry of Health has reported 143 suspected cases in the entire country, with 27 suspected cases in Abidjan.

The Ministry of Health is currently carrying out vaccination campaigns using existing national vaccine stocks in the areas of Abidjan where cases have been identified. WHO is working closely with UNICEF and Aventis to dispatch the crucially needed vaccine to supply the mass vaccination campaign in Abidjan. The campaign will cover the city's 3.5 million population and will begin on 17 September. Two hundred vaccination teams have already been trained and all vaccine sites identified. The international team will be assisting the Ministry of Health to implement this campaign. (see previous report)

WHO advises travellers to CÃ´te d'Ivoire to be aware of the risk of yellow fever and to ensure that they are vaccinated, a requirement of the International Health Regulations.
