As of 31 March, 140 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever have been reported in Angola. Of these, 132 have been fatal. Cases continue to be concentrated in Uige.

Mobile surveillance teams in Uige continue to follow up on rumours and conduct active searches for additional cases. Contact tracing has also been intensified. These activities are now supported by a mobile laboratory in Uige, which has greatly expedited diagnostic testing.

WHO is working with the Ministry of Health in the Democratic Republic of Congo to train local staff in the border area near Angola in case detection and management.
