From 3-8 January 2005, 3 cases of meningococcal disease were reported from Brejing and Treijing refugee camps in northern Chad, with a population of c. 60,000. The 3 cases were positive for Neisseria meningitidis W135 by latex test. Laboratory confirmation will be conducted by the WHO Collaborating Centre, Institute Médecine Tropicale des Services de Santé des Armées (IMTSSA).

WHO, UNHCR, UNICEF, Médecins sans Frontières-Holland and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) are coordinating the response to the outbreak. Emergency control measures to be implemented are case management and a mass immunization campaign, with surveillance strengthened in other camps and neighbouring districts.
