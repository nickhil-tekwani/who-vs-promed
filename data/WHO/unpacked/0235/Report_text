25 October 2000 Disease Outbreak Reported

As of 25 October, the Ugandan Ministry of Health has reported 176 cases, including 64 deaths.

There have been suspected cases reported from several settlements for internally displaced persons in Gulu district and mobile teams of health care workers and volunteers are carrying out case finding and contact tracing in these settlements. The focus is also on increasing public awareness of the disease and its containment.

A radio communications centre has been established in Gulu. Twenty hand-held radios with a dedicated frequency have been dispersed to the mobile teams who are now able to inform the centre quickly of suspected cases and contacts, request transport for ill persons and request burial teams. 

To date, the National Task Force for the Control of Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers has not confirmed any cases outside Gulu district in Uganda. WHO supports enhanced surveillance but does not recommend any special restrictions on travel or trade with Uganda.
