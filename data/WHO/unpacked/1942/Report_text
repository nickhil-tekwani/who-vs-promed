The patient is an 86 year-old man from Jiangsu, China who travelled to Taiwan, Province of China, with a tourist group from 17-24 December. He felt uncomfortable on 19 December, and was admitted to a hospital on 24 December after being diagnosed with bilateral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The patient is currently intubated and supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The other tour members have returned, except for the two daughters of the patient who remained and showed no symptoms.
