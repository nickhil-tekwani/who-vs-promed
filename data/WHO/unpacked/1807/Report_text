03 August 1998 Disease Outbreak Reported

The national health authorities of Liberia have reported an outbreak of cholera/diarrhoea which started at the end of May. The areas affected by the outbreak are Nimba County and Margibi County. Up to 26 June a total of 560 cases with 12 deaths had occurred. The county health teams carried out various control measures in the areas affected (chlorination of wells, health education, opening of ORT treatment centres). Additional support and supplies were requested from the Ministry of Health. Follow-up missions were undertaken by WHO in collaboration with the two county health teams involved. Another outbreak of severe diarrhoea was reported in Sinoe County at the beginning of July although the number of cases is not yet known. Heavy rains in the area have hampered aid to the area as bridges have been washed away.

As well as the activities carried out by the county health teams, WHO, UNICEF, the Belgian Red Cross and other NGO's are collaborating with the national health authorities and the local communities to provide aid.
