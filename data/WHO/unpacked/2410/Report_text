22 June 2004

As of 20 June, the health authorities in Yambio County and the team assisting them in the outbreak have reassessed the number of cases of Ebola haemorrhagic fever (EHF) in view of the clinical presentation of the disease, epidemiology and laboratory results. As a result of the reclassification, 18 cases and 6 deaths of EHF have now been reported.

Following the latest laboratory results from the WHO Collaborating Centre at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), United States, 12 of the 30 most recently reported cases (see report ) have now been classified as measles cases. Measles cases have been present in the community and were first reported to the WHO South Sudan Early Warning and Response Network (EWARN) in the second week of March 2004, but the increase in the number of cases was detected because of the active surveillance system established for EHF. Additional laboratory tests are underway.

Active surveillance and follow-up of contacts is ongoing.
