17 May 2002 Disease Outbreak Reported

As of 15 May 2002, 12 587 cases, including 1 447 deaths have been reported to WHO. The downward trend in the epidemic noted in the report of 6 May is continuing, with 1 district, Paul VI, remaining above the epidemic threshold.

The following measures continue to be taken by Le Comité National de Pilotage pour la Méningite (Crisis Committee): epidemiological surveillance, laboratory confirmation of suspected cases and case management.

Since the emergence of meningococcal serogroup W135 in Burkina Faso has major implications for public health in the African continent, a research agenda has been agreed by the Crisis Committee. The research is being implemented by a team consisting of WHO, Epicentre, WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Meningococci, Oslo, Norway, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, Atlanta, United States ) and l'Association pour la Médecine préventive (AMP). The topics include: a detailed description and evaluation of the risk factors of the current epidemic; an ecological analysis of association between vaccine coverage and epidemics; N. meningitidis seroprevalence and carriage; and the socioeconomic impact of the epidemic. The team is also assessing the feasibility of estimating immunogenicity and efficacy of tetravalent vaccine.
