Shared Resources, Shared Values? Ethical Implications of Sharing Translation Resources	The exploitation of large corpora to create and populate shared translation resources has been hampered in two areas: first, practical problems ("locked-in" data, ineffective exchange formats, client reservations); and second, ethical and legal problems. Recent developments, notably on-line collaborative translation environments (Desillets, 2007) and greater industry openness, might have been expected to highlight such issues. Yet the growing use of shared data is being addressed only gingerly. Good reasons lie behind the failure to broach the ethics of shared resources. The issues are challenging: confidentiality, ownership, copyright, authorial rights, attribution, the law, protectionism, costs, fairness, motivation, trust, quality, reliability. However, we argue that, though complex, these issues should not be swept under the carpet. The huge demand for translation cannot be met without intelligent sharing of resources (Kelly, 2009) . Relevant ethical considerations have already been identified in translation and related domains, in such texts as Codes of Ethics, international conventions and declarations, and Codes of Professional Conduct; these can be useful here. We outline two case studies from current industry initiatives, highlighting their ethical implications. We identify questions which users and developers should be asking and relate these to existing debates and codes as a practical framework for their consideration.	y	2010								Survey, Position, Opinon, Tutorial or Guide 		2010.jec-1.2	51859670	8	Drugan, Jo  and Babych, Bogdan	
Shedding (a Thousand Points of) Light on Biased Language	This paper considers the linguistic indicators of bias in political text. We used Amazon Mechanical Turk judgments about sentences from American political blogs, asking annotators to indicate whether a sentence showed bias, and if so, in which political direction and through which word tokens. We also asked annotators questions about their own political views. We conducted a preliminary analysis of the data, exploring how different groups perceive bias in different blogs, and showing some lexical indicators strongly associated with perceived bias.	y	2010	annotator bias	Annotation	y					Dataset, Benchmark	English	W10-0723	10047522	64	Yano, Tae  and Resnik, Philip  and Smith, Noah A.	
Close Engagements with Artificial Companions: Key Social, Psychological, Ethical, and Design Issues	This book is an edited collection of chapters on artificial companions (ACs) resulting from a workshop. It purports to discuss the philosophical and ethical issues associated with ACs, what ACs should be like and how to construct them, and to provide examples of special-purpose ACs. Table 1 shows the chapters of the book and their respective authors. When I bought a vacuum-cleaning robot called Roomba, it never occurred to me that this was actually a companion, as claimed by Peltu and Wilks in this book's afterword. Yes, it independently helps me, autonomously recharges its battery, and occasionally talks: "Clean brushes." I had higher expectations of a companion, however. Perhaps it would feel more like a companion if it expressed disgust with my mess (cf. Bee et al.), inquired knowledgeably about my holidays and family (cf. Wilks), empathized with my feelings (cf. Bevacqua et al.), and advised scraping off spilled porridge with a spoon (cf. Sloman). There is no consensus in this book on what an AC should be like; each chapter tends to express an alternative (often quite radically different) opinion. In the foreword, Wilks defines ACs as "conversationalists or confidants" that get to know their owners, assist with Internet interactions, provide company and companionship, and build their owner's biography. However, when analyzing the necessary conditions for being an AC, Pulman concludes that conversation is not needed, and Boden strongly objects to ACs as confidants because of privacy concerns. Rather than providing company, according to O'Hara, ACs will represent (technophobe) owners in complex dealings with technology. Lowe takes this one step further and questions whether ACs are really others or whether they are cooler-headed versions of ourselves. Whereas Romano defines an AC as a good friend who, among other things, makes you laugh, shares your emotions, and listens, Sloman focuses on the (in his opinion) more difficult problem of creating ACs that provide help and assistance. Turkle sees ACs as offering care as well as being good company, teachers, and lovers (!). Taylor et al. deviate from the anthropomorphic view of ACs, and discuss a robot that has no human-like properties other than that it is fed on organic material.	y	2011								Survey, Position, Opinon, Tutorial or Guide 		J11-2006	13228670	1	Masthoff, Judith	
An Annotation Scheme for Automated Bias Detection in Wikipedia	BiasML is a novel annotation scheme with the purpose of identifying the presence as well as nuances of biased language within the subset of Wikipedia articles dedicated to service providers. Whereas Wikipedia currently uses only manual flagging to detect possible bias, our scheme provides a foundation for the automating of bias flagging by improving upon the methodology of annotation schemes in classic sentiment analysis. We also address challenges unique to the task of identifying biased writing within the specific context of Wikipedia's neutrality policy. We perform a detailed analysis of inter-annotator agreement, which shows that although the agreement scores for intra-sentential tags were relatively low, the agreement scores on the sentence and entry levels were encouraging (74.8% and 66.7%, respectively). Based on an analysis of our first implementation of our scheme, we suggest possible improvements to our guidelines, in hope that further rounds of annotation after incorporating them could provide appropriate data for use within a machine learning framework for automated detection of bias within Wikipedia.	y	2011	annotator bias	Annotation	y		Wikipedia			Characterisation	English	W11-0406	6785732	6	Herzig, Livnat  and Nunes, Alex  and Snir, Batia	
Modelling Annotator Bias with Multi-task Gaussian Processes: An Application to Machine Translation Quality Estimation	Annotating linguistic data is often a complex, time consuming and expensive endeavour. Even with strict annotation guidelines, human subjects often deviate in their analyses, each bringing different biases, interpretations of the task and levels of consistency. We present novel techniques for learning from the outputs of multiple annotators while accounting for annotator specific behaviour. These techniques use multi-task Gaussian Processes to learn jointly a series of annotator and metadata specific models, while explicitly representing correlations between models which can be learned directly from data. Our experiments on two machine translation quality estimation datasets show uniform significant accuracy gains from multi-task learning, and consistently outperform strong baselines.	y	2013	annotator bias	NLG		Translation	WMT12,WPTP12	bias measurement	Gaussian Processes	Method	English, Spanish 	P13-1004	6117965	107	Cohn, Trevor  and Specia, Lucia	
How Topic Biases Your Results? A Case Study of Sentiment Analysis and Irony Detection in Italian	In this paper we present our approach to automatically identify the subjectivity, polarity and irony of Italian Tweets. Our system which reaches and outperforms the state of the art in Italian is well adapted for different domains since it uses abstract word features instead of bag of words. We also present experiments carried out to study how Italian Sentiment Analysis systems react to domain changes. We show that bag of words approaches commonly used in Sentiment Analysis do not adapt well to domain changes.	y	2015	topic bias	Classification	y	Documents	SENTIPOLC	bias measurement	SVM	Method	Italian	R15-1006	2392146	5	Barbieri, Francesco  and Ronzano, Francesco  and Saggion, Horacio	
Yes, We Care! Results of the Ethics and Natural Language Processing Surveys	We present here the context and results of two surveys (a French one and an international one) concerning Ethics and NLP, which we designed and conducted between June and September 2015. These surveys follow other actions related to raising concern for ethics in our community, including a Journée d'études, a workshop and the Ethics and Big Data Charter. The concern for ethics shows to be quite similar in both surveys, despite a few differences which we present and discuss. The surveys also lead to think there is a growing awareness in the field concerning ethical issues, which translates into a willingness to get involved in ethics-related actions, to debate about the topic and to see ethics be included in major conferences themes. We finally discuss the limits of the surveys and the means of action we consider for the future. The raw data from the two surveys are freely available online.	y	2016								Survey, Position, Opinon, Tutorial or Guide 		L16-1252	34376694	10	Fort, Kar{\"e}n  and Couillault, Alain	
Analyzing Gender Bias in Student Evaluations	University students in the United States are routinely asked to provide feedback on the quality of the instruction they have received. Such feedback is widely used by university administrators to evaluate teaching ability, despite growing evidence that students assign lower numerical scores to women and people of color, regardless of the actual quality of instruction. In this paper, we analyze students' written comments on faculty evaluation forms spanning eight years and five STEM disciplines in order to determine whether open-ended comments reflect these same biases. First, we apply sentiment analysis techniques to the corpus of comments to determine the overall affect of each comment. We then use this information, in combination with other features, to explore whether there is bias in how students describe their instructors. We show that while the gender of the evaluated instructor does not seem to affect students' expressed level of overall satisfaction with their instruction, it does strongly influence the language that they use to describe their instructors and their experience in class.	y	2016	gender bias	Classification	y	Comment	Teacher evaluation	bias detection	Random Forest Ensemble	Method	English	C16-1083	16759259	8	Terkik, Andamlak  and Prud{'}hommeaux, Emily  and Ovesdotter Alm, Cecilia  and Homan, Christopher  and Franklin, Scott	
The Social Impact of Natural Language Processing	Medical sciences have long since established an ethics code for experiments, to minimize the risk of harm to subjects. Natural language processing (NLP) used to involve mostly anonymous corpora, with the goal of enriching linguistic analysis, and was therefore unlikely to raise ethical concerns. As NLP becomes increasingly wide-spread and uses more data from social media, however, the situation has changed: the outcome of NLP experiments and applications can now have a direct effect on individual users' lives. Until now, the discourse on this topic in the field has not followed the technological development, while public discourse was often focused on exaggerated dangers. This position paper tries to take back the initiative and start a discussion. We identify a number of social implications of NLP and discuss their ethical significance, as well as ways to address them.	y	2016								Survey, Position, Opinon, Tutorial or Guide 		P16-2096	1083991	205	Hovy, Dirk  and Spruit, Shannon L.

6 Community Sensitization Keeping Yellow Fever at Bay in Uganda
7 In response to an outbreak of yellow fever, the Ugandan government launched an awareness campaign through media, door-to-door outreach, drama performances, and community health workers. The country also introduced a free vaccination program for babies between nine and twelve months old, which distributed vaccines to about 150 babies in one state within its first several weeks.

As local governments look to channel thriving climate justice youth movements toward civic engagement and policymaking, dozens of city governments around the country are establishing programs that give youth an opportunity to influence municipal decisions addressing climate issues. These programs—which have sprung up in San Antonio; Portland, Oregon; and elsewhere—also offer students training and networking opportunities, teach practical skills, and will hopefully open new career paths for the next generation of climate leaders. 



“It is not just giving youth a seat at the table; it’s about youth being active participants with the adults in the conversation [and] the action that comes after that conversation,” says Nancy Deutsch, director at Youth-Nex, an interdisciplinary center to promote effective youth development housed at the University of Virginia.&nbsp;



It’s unclear, however, how much youth councils are actually affecting larger public policies implemented by adults in municipal government. While these programs are meant to encourage youth participation and investment in policymaking, Deutsch stresses that “the onus [is] on the adults to demonstrate that they have changed how they make decisions and to document how the system has changed as a result of the youth council.” The success of youth climate council programs ultimately depends on how they affect the skills and attitudes of participants, as well as whether the councils’ suggestions end up shaping city policies and practices.&nbsp;



Success requires support and inclusion



Youth councils can take many forms, but organizers say that what makes them effective is transparency and clarity about the scope of their role as part of local government and the degree of autonomy and oversight they require. Deutsch says that the development stage is critical to organizing a successful youth council because it needs a solid foundation and clearly defined role and responsibilities from the outset.&nbsp;



“Before starting a council, the city should have outlined what the council members will do, how their ideas will be put into practice, and what their power is within the city government and policymaking system,” Deutsch said.&nbsp;



On the San Antonio Mayor’s Youth Engagement Council, Austin-based nonprofit EcoRise is responsible for much of this work. It facilitates the youth council with support from the mayor’s office, the Office of Sustainability, and the Hollomon Price Foundation. Administrators at EcoRise select council members through an application process, and councilors serve for one academic year and attend at least two monthly meetings. The major components of the San Antonio council are standardized and include a speaker series, student projects, and facetime with municipal leaders to give council members a chance to influence decision-making and hold leaders accountable for their action or inaction on climate change.&nbsp;



“Students are being directly connected to not only professionals and organizations, but members of the Office of Sustainability and the mayor as well,” says Laura Fuller, communications and design manager at EcoRise. “It was really powerful to see last year. They were grilling [the mayor] and really wanting to know answers and see accountability.”



Over in Oregon, the Portland Youth Climate Council is much more diffuse. Members do not serve fixed terms, the recruitment process is informal, and access to municipal leaders is less direct. Since joining last year, 14-year-old Joel Guren says the group has discussed significant issues, including Portland’s pedestrian design guide update and the need to improve Portland’s urban tree canopy. Without a strong support structure however, Guren says that the youth council struggles to get through to city leadership.&nbsp;



“It’s a group that was created to advise the city council, but they’ve kind of forgotten about us,” they said.&nbsp;



Portland City Council did not respond to inquiries by press time.&nbsp;



Detajha Woodson, Youth-Nex’s program and outreach associate, is establishing a youth council in Charlottesville, Virginia, to integrate the perspectives of young people in developing youth-oriented programs at Youth-Nex. She hopes to set a foundation for equity and inclusion of marginalized students, particularly students of color, that flows upward from the recruitment stage. Woodson has designed an application with open-ended demographic questions and questions about what issues applicants most want to address in their communities, which will help the Youth-Nex team select councilors who represent diverse communities and needs.&nbsp;



“I want this to be very inclusive, very diverse,” she says.&nbsp;



Deutsch and Woodson agree that compensating students for their time is essential to building an inclusive program because it shows students that their time is valued and makes serving on a council more feasible for participants from low-income backgrounds. But Woodson noted that it can be complicated to pay students when information like social security numbers or other forms of personal documents are required to do so—that kind of information requirement can exclude or deter students based on their immigration status.&nbsp;



Students on the San Antonio council will be compensated for the first time during the 2022-23 school year. Brittany Jayroe, director of youth programs at EcoRise, says students will be paid stipends “in the way that best fits their needs to remove barriers to participation.” EcoRise also offers its youth council application materials in both English and Spanish to make them accessible to a greater number of potential applicants.&nbsp;



After joining a youth council, students also need a solid mental and emotional support structure to facilitate their work. Accommodations such as flexibility for councilors who work part-time jobs, have caretaking responsibilities, or just need to take some time off to focus on coursework can encourage participation. Some youth council programs have built-in counseling services, but in San Antonio, staff at EcoRise often fill this role in a less official capacity.&nbsp;



“When I felt really overwhelmed and just very stressed by the content of the program [or] just because of all the things going on in my life, when I’ve reached out to Sharon [Huerta] and other members, they’ve been really helpful and always there to support us,” said 16-year-old Caroline McGuire.



Youth councils are proactive, but do city officials pay attention?



While the structure of the San Antonio program allows youth council members direct access to municipal leaders, administrators at EcoRise say it has been hard to gauge the youth council’s influence on city decisions. During the program’s first year, students were tasked with developing policy proposals and presenting them to the city council. Fuller says it isn’t apparent whether the policymakers incorporated student ideas into their work.&nbsp;



“I’ve reached out to the city myself to ask like, ‘What’s up? What happened?’ and haven’t gotten a response,” she said.&nbsp;



San Antonio City Council did not respond to inquiries by press time.&nbsp;



Portland’s youth council is facing similar struggles, particularly with its relationship to the rest of the city’s officials. Despite the Multnomah County and City of Portland’s 100% renewable energy by 2050 resolution including a clause to create the youth climate council, Guren says the council is treated like any other outside organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;



“I would like it if they treated us as more a part of things, instead of just another organization that’s helping against climate change,” they said.



Regardless of city officials’ lack of response to youth councils’ input, organizers are still moving forward and focusing on improvements. Before inaugurating its second cohort, program administrators at EcoRise decided to shift gears. Huerta, an EcoRise education specialist, says that this past academic year there was “more of a focus on research-based projects and doing more hands-on work.”&nbsp;



This decision was partly in response to the ambiguous response of city officials to the previous year’s policy proposals. EcoRise also wanted to embrace Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR), an “innovative approach to positive youth and community development based on social justice principles in which young people are trained to conduct systematic research to improve their lives, their communities, and the institutions intended to serve them.”



Deutsch says YPAR is an excellent tool for youth councils “because it both centers young people’s experiences and definitions of issues and engages them in not only researching the issues but in constructing potential solutions.”



The projects that San Antonio youth councilors developed and implemented this year followed this model. They were grouped under the themes of community health, biodiversity, food security, transportation, and recycling and waste management. McGuire worked with four other youth councilors on the community health team to develop a workshop to support vulnerable communities in Westside San Antonio.&nbsp;



“The major thing that we did was to distribute a survey and then get data from that to understand what the community needs,” they said. “We asked mostly open-ended questions. We wanted people to really tell us their experiences living in the area and where they see their needs are not being met.”&nbsp;



The food security team also tailored its project to support underserved communities in Westside and Southside San Antonio. Symphany Brietzke, 17, who worked on the project, says she understood the need for material support in the Southside because she lives there and has “seen [the need] firsthand.” For Brietzke, the resources made available through the youth council made it possible for her to support her vulnerable neighbors. After conducting research about community needs, the team collected food and hygiene product donations and built two “Little Free Pantries.” Modeled after Little Free Libraries, community members can take food or supplies from these stocked boxes in public parks that are maintained by local park staff.&nbsp;



Going forward, Huerta says EcoRise is “looking at reflections and lessons learned of how we can merge the first year, where we really focused on policy proposals, and also this year, how more research-based action would work.”



The team also hopes to improve communication between youth councilors and city administrators by inviting administrators to council meetings and rolling out a mentorship program to partner students with administrators, allowing them to form stronger relationships.&nbsp;



Guren says that in Portland, the path forward is less clear. Without an active link to city leadership or liaisons like those at EcoRise, the councilors have limited power. As Deutsch pointed out, adults must take an active role in making youth council programs work, and initiative to improve communication will need to come from the city.



Empowering the Next Generation



Despite challenges, youth climate councils in their various forms have significant effects on their student participants. Despite frustrations, Guren says they “really enjoy helping with the climate movement” and that the Portland Youth Climate Council has provided a space to engage with peers and work on issues that matter to them. McGuire also says the experience “has really opened my perspective of what environmental science can look like and my role in this whole climate crisis.”&nbsp;



For Brietzke, who graduated this past summer, her time on the San Antonio youth council shaped her career trajectory. She has her mind set on a degree in biology and plans to continue educating people about climate change-related issues. She got some of her first experience as a public speaker on the topic at an energy and water event at the Tobin Center earlier this year, thanks to youth council connections.&nbsp;



“This is the next generation,” says Fuller. “They’re going to continue to grow up and take on these projects, maybe with even more momentum than they would have if they had not been on the council, and that will bring about real change.”

error: can't create or remove files in install directory

The following error occurred while trying to add or remove files in the
installation directory:

    [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/test-easy-install-33266.write-test'

The installation directory you specified (via --install-dir, --prefix, or
the distutils default setting) was:

    /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/

Perhaps your account does not have write access to this directory?  If the
installation directory is a system-owned directory, you may need to sign in
as the administrator or "root" account.  If you do not have administrative
access to this machine, you may wish to choose a different installation
directory, preferably one that is listed in your PYTHONPATH environment
variable.

For information on other options, you may wish to consult the
documentation at:

  https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/easy_install.html

Please make the appropriate changes for your system and try again.

              <span style="font-weight: 400;">
               Things started falling apart for 33-year-old David Udo when in 2020 he observed that tumours were growing around his eye and jaw.
              </span>
             </p>
             <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400;">
               In early 2021, he underwent a test at the Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital (ABUTH), Zaria, Kaduna State, the result, which showed that the tumor was cancerous.
              </span>
             </p>
             <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400;">
               Udo would lose his job because the cancerous lumps kept festering and this made him very unproductive.
              </span>
             </p>
             <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400;">
               Then, he began to receive medical attention at the hospital; the first treatment he underwent was chemotherapy – a drug treatment that uses powerful chemicals to kill fast-growing cells in the body. This is delivered under six cycles at an interval of 3 weeks. Each of these cycles costs around N40,000.
              </span>
             </p>
             <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400;">
               With all his savings gone, he had to depend on his wife and a few of his friends to cover the cost of the treatments. Notwithstanding the treatments, the tumour ruptured, leading to uncontrollable bleeding.
              </span>
             </p>
             <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400;">
               “The treatment seemed to have been effective but after a while, the problem kept getting worse. I was then referred to the National Hospital Abuja to undergo radiotherapy, a cancer treatment that uses high doses of radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumours” said Udo, while conversing with BONews.
              </span>
             </p>
             <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400;">
               Regrettably, the radiotherapy equipment at Abuja hospital were not working—a testimony to the fallen state of health care in the country.
              </span>

               Without wasting time, he sent a message and one of the officials handling the page responded to his message. From instagram, the conversation continued on WhatsApp where he passionately laid bare his challenges and the foundation promised that if his case was genuine they would seek funds to cover the cost of his treatment in Lagos.

               The Foundation for Cancer Care is a non-profit organization committed to enhancing cancer care and prevention in Nigeria. Since its establishment, it has continued to provide free cancer screening, diagnosis, and cancer treatment to identified patients from low socioeconomic communities.
              </span>
             </p>
             <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400;">
               Professor Chummy Nwogu, a US-based medical doctor, founded the nonprofit in 2008 with a group of experts who were interested in enhancing cancer care in West Africa.
              </span>
             </p>
             <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400;">
               “We started the foundation with the primary objective to construct a cancer care centre (Lakeshore Cancer Centre) in Lagos, promotion of cancer awareness, screening and prevention, cancer patient advocacy, capacity building measures for health practitioners and fundraising to assist cancer patients to pursue treatments,” Nwogu told BONews.
              </span>
             </p>
             <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400;">
               The Lakeshore Cancer Center is Nigeria’s first operational private clinical care facility solely dedicated to cancer care and prevention.

              <span style="font-weight: 400;">
               On how beneficiaries are selected, the founder said after applications are received, the organisation would adopt a stringent process, to select only indigent patients, who obviously cannot afford the cost of radiography treatments.
              </span>
             </p>
             <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400;">
               So far, the foundation has conducted free cancer screenings for over 4,000 people, trained over 1,500 medical professionals in various capacities, engaged over 35 organisations in different cancer initiatives and provided funding for radiotherapy to eight cancer patients.

             </p>
             <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400;">
               One of them is Mr. Anthony Okerafor. The Lagos-based 76-year-old man told BONews that he could not afford the treatment for radiography when he was diagnosed with cancer in 2021.
              </span>
             </p>
             <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400;">
               However, a doctor LUTH, where he had gone for treatments, reached out to the Foundation for Cancer Care to help him secure funds to pursue his treatment. Luckily for him, the request was granted.

               “After some tests, I was asked to pay the sum of N1 million for radiotherapy. I was confused because I didn’t know how to raise that kind of money.
              </span>
             </p>
             <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400;">
               “A doctor helped me to contact the nonprofit and they helped me with the sum of N460,000. My children were able to raise the balance. I am really grateful for that kind gesture.”

               Speaking further, he noted that his doctor informed him that the treatment was successful.

   {"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"VideoObject","name":"Cancer treatment is a burden too heavy, but an NGO is coming to the rescue","description":"Things started falling apart for 33-year-old David Udo when in 2020 he observed that tumours were growing around his eye and jaw.\r\n\r\nIn early 2021, he underwent a test at the Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital (ABUTH), Zaria, Kaduna State, the result, which showed that the tumor was cancerous.\r\n\r\nUdo would lose his job because the cancerous lumps kept festering and this made him very unproductive.\r\n\r\nThen, he began to receive medical attention at the hospital; the first treatment he underwent was chemotherapy - a drug treatment that uses powerful chemicals to kill fast-growing cells in the body. This is delivered under six cycles at an interval of 3 weeks. Each of these cycles costs around N40,000.\r\n\r\nWith all his savings gone, he had to depend on his wife and a few of his friends to cover the cost of the treatments. Notwithstanding the treatments, the tumour ruptured, leading to uncontrollable bleeding.\r\n\r\n\"The treatment seemed to have been effective but after a while, the problem kept getting worse. I was then referred to the National Hospital Abuja to undergo radiotherapy, a cancer treatment that uses high doses of radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumours\" said Udo, while conversing with BONews.\r\n\r\nRegrettably, the radiotherapy equipment at Abuja hospital were not working—a testimony to the fallen state of health care in the country.\r\n\r\nHe was, thereafter, referred to the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) Cancer Center where he was informed that radiotherapy would cost the sum of N787,000.\r\n\r\nWith no job and dependency on handouts from a few individuals, how would he afford that sum of money? This question left him devastated and according to him, \"depressed and tired of life.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the WHO, cancer is the rapid creation of abnormal cells that grow beyond their usual boundaries, and which can then invade adjoining parts of the body and spread to other organs.\r\n\r\n\"Human beings are made up of cells, and the cells grow and die. But when someone has cancer it means that the cells begin to grow abnormally in the body. And this could result in death,\" said Dr Oge Illegbune Lakeshore, a doctor at the Lakeshore Cancer Center in Lagos.\r\n\r\nA report by the American Society of Clinical Oncology shows that in Nigeria over 124,815 people were diagnosed with different forms of cancer in 2020. And about 72,000 Nigerians lose their lives to cancer annually.\r\n\r\nIf detected early cancer can be treated effectively, however, the cost of treatments is still very expensive and out of reach for an average Nigerian.\r\n\r\nA report by dataphyte, a media research and data analytics organisation, shows that chemotherapy and radiotherapy costs between N600,000 to N1.5 million per session. Cancer drugs are also expensive costing as much as N300,000 per month.\r\n\r\nThis is a fortune when contrasted against the average monthly living wage for an individual in Nigeria which is a paltry sum of just N43,000.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHope shines in the dark\r\n\r\nSometimes in 2021, distraught Udo was scrolling through his instagram feeds when he stumbled upon the Foundation for Cancer Care. He clicked on the page and found out the foundation could actually help him pay for the radiography treatment he badly needed.\r\n\r\nWithout wasting time, he sent a message and one of the officials handling the page responded to his message. From instagram, the conversation continued on WhatsApp where he passionately laid bare his challenges and the foundation promised that if his case was genuine they would seek funds to cover the cost of his treatment in Lagos.\r\n\r\nAnd sooner than he expected a doctor at LUTH informed him that the cost of the radiotherapy had been covered by the nonprofit. A week after the radiation therapy, the tumour started shrinking and he stopped bleeding.\r\n\r\nCancer cells can disrupt organ function and may destroy healthy cells in organs which can result in death.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the tumours refueled the hope of survival in him. Mr Udo is now continuing follow-up treatments at ABUTH, Kaduna.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSaving cancer patients' lives through kindness\r\n\r\nThe Foundation for Cancer Care is a non-profit organization committed to enhancing cancer care and prevention in Nigeria. Since its establishment, it has continued to provide free cancer screening, diagnosis, and cancer treatment to identified patients from low socioeconomic communities.\r\n\r\nProfessor Chummy Nwogu, a US-based medical doctor, founded the nonprofit in 2008 with a group of experts who were interested in enhancing cancer care in West Africa.\r\n\r\n\"We started the foundation with the primary objective to construct a cancer care centre (Lakeshore Cancer Centre) in Lagos, promotion of cancer awareness, screening and prevention, cancer patient advocacy, capacity building measures for health practitioners and fundraising to assist cancer patients to pursue treatments,\" Nwogu told BONews.\r\n\r\nThe Lakeshore Cancer Center is Nigeria’s first operational private clinical care facility solely dedicated to cancer care and prevention.\r\n\r\nOn how beneficiaries are selected, the founder said after applications are received, the organisation would adopt a stringent process, to select only indigent patients, who obviously cannot afford the cost of radiography treatments.\r\n\r\nSo far, the foundation has conducted free cancer screenings for over 4,000 people, trained over 1,500 medical professionals in various capacities, engaged over 35 organisations in different cancer initiatives and provided funding for radiotherapy to eight cancer patients.\r\n\r\nOne of them is Mr. Anthony Okerafor. The Lagos-based 76-year-old man told BONews that he could not afford the treatment for radiography when he was diagnosed with cancer in 2021.\r\n\r\nHowever, a doctor LUTH, where he had gone for treatments, reached out to the Foundation for Cancer Care to help him secure funds to pursue his treatment. Luckily for him, the request was granted.\r\n\r\n\"After some tests, I was asked to pay the sum of N1 million for radiotherapy. I was confused because I didn't know how to raise that kind of money.\r\n\r\n\"A doctor helped me to contact the nonprofit and they helped me with the sum of N460,000. My children were able to raise the balance. I am really grateful for that kind gesture.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking further, he noted that his doctor informed him that the treatment was successful.\r\n\r\nCancer patients during consultation\r\n\r\nMental health of cancer patients matters too\r\n\r\nApart from funding treatments for cancer patients, the nonprofit also provides mental health support to patients traumatised by cancer.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that 20,000 cancer patients are at risk of severe mental health disorders because of cancer diagnosis, and less than two percent of these patients have ever received any professional psychological support after cancer diagnosis and during treatment.\r\n\r\n\"The Dewdrops Support Group consists of over 100 cancer survivors from our clinic, Lakeshore Cancer Center. The foundation coordinates this group and we have quarterly meetings through which we are able to provide support to survivors,\" said Ms. Tolulope Adeyoola-Oladipupo, the Programs Coordinator.\r\n\r\nThe group was created to create a safe space for survivors to receive support and encouragement from one another and open to anyone battling with cancer and anyone who is willing to join.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDoes cancer have a cure?\r\n\r\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, cancer has a cure but it depends on the type and stage of the cancer, the type of treatment they can get, and other factors. Some cancers are more likely to be cured than others.\r\n\r\n\"About a third of cancer can be prevented or cured. It is wrong to believe that cancer is a death sentence. Cancer could also be managed so that the quality of life will improve.\r\n\r\n\"We just need to encourage people to go for regular cancer screenings,\" said Professor Nwogu.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut there are tons of challenges\r\n\r\nDespite its zeal to improve the quality of life of cancer patients, the nonprofit efforts are frustrated by a host of so many challenges; the chief of which is funding.\r\n\r\n\"Funding to be able to assist with care at different levels is one of our biggest challenges because our funds come from donors and crowdfund,\" Professor Nwogu said.\r\n\r\nAnother prominent challenge is also infrastructure limitations. Nigeria currently only has four functional cancer treatment centres, which is not enough to treat the immense number of Nigerian citizens who suffer from cancer.\r\n\r\nNigeria reportedly has only three public cancer treatment centres and in a population of more than 200 million, there are only nine radiation therapy machines.\r\n\r\nCultural and religious beliefs could also be barriers to getting treatment. Many Nigerians kick against the organisation's plea to get tested for cancer.\r\n\r\nDespite all the challenges the Foundation for Cancer Care is poised to make a difference.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnd what can we learn?\r\n\r\nProviding help to cancer patients is indeed a huge task but one step forward is a giant one that can save lives and make a big difference in homes. For Mr. David Udo, who stepped on the thin line between life and death, Foundation for Cancer Care has given him a reason to live again.\r\n\r\n\"I had lost hope. Imagine what would have happened if the nonprofit did not sponsor my radiography treatments. I'm eternally grateful for what they did,\" he said.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis story has been made possible by Nigeria Health Watch with support from the Solutions Journalism Network, a nonprofit organization dedicated to rigorous and compelling reporting about responses to social problems.","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"BONews Service","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://bonewssng.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/BONEWS-SERVICES.jpg","width":960,"height":283}},"thumbnailUrl":"https://bonewssng.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Cancer-walk.jpg","uploadDate":"2023-01-04T02:11:31+0000"}

A week after the radiation therapy, the tumour started shrinking and he stopped bleeding.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cancer cells can disrupt organ function and may destroy healthy cells in organs which can result in death.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The removal of the tumours refueled the hope of survival in him. Mr Udo is now continuing follow-up treatments at ABUTH, Kaduna.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Saving cancer patients' lives through kindness<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Foundation for Cancer Care is a non-profit organization committed to enhancing cancer care and prevention in Nigeria. Since its establishment, it has continued to provide free cancer screening, diagnosis, and cancer treatment to identified patients from low socioeconomic communities.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professor Chummy Nwogu, a US-based medical doctor, founded the nonprofit in 2008 with a group of experts who were interested in enhancing cancer care in West Africa.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"We started the foundation with the primary objective to construct a cancer care centre (Lakeshore Cancer Centre) in Lagos, promotion of cancer awareness, screening and prevention, cancer patient advocacy, capacity building measures for health practitioners and fundraising to assist cancer patients to pursue treatments,\" Nwogu told BONews.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Lakeshore Cancer Center is Nigeria\u2019s first operational private clinical care facility solely dedicated to cancer care and prevention.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On how beneficiaries are selected, the founder said after applications are received, the organisation would adopt a stringent process, to select only indigent patients, who obviously cannot afford the cost of radiography treatments.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, the foundation has conducted free cancer screenings for over 4,000 people, trained over 1,500 medical professionals in various capacities, engaged over 35 organisations in different cancer initiatives and provided funding for radiotherapy to eight cancer patients.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of them is Mr. Anthony Okerafor. The Lagos-based 76-year-old man told BONews that he could not afford the treatment for radiography when he was diagnosed with cancer in 2021.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, a doctor LUTH, where he had gone for treatments, reached out to the Foundation for Cancer Care to help him secure funds to pursue his treatment. Luckily for him, the request was granted.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"After some tests, I was asked to pay the sum of N1 million for radiotherapy. I was confused because I didn't know how to raise that kind of money.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"A doctor helped me to contact the nonprofit and they helped me with the sum of N460,000. My children were able to raise the balance. I am really grateful for that kind gesture.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking further, he noted that his doctor informed him that the treatment was successful.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_13434\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-13434\" src=\"https:\/\/bonewssng.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/Cancer-story-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/> Cancer patients during consultation[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<b>Mental health of cancer patients matters too<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from funding treatments for cancer patients, the nonprofit also provides mental health support to patients traumatised by cancer.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/15173149\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">estimated<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that 20,000 cancer patients are at risk of severe mental health disorders because of cancer diagnosis, and<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/15173149\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">less than <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">two percent of these patients have ever received any professional psychological support after cancer diagnosis and during treatment.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"The Dewdrops Support Group consists of over 100 cancer survivors from our clinic, Lakeshore Cancer Center. The foundation coordinates this group and we have quarterly meetings through which we are able to provide support to survivors,\" said Ms. Tolulope Adeyoola-Oladipupo, the Programs Coordinator.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group was created to create a safe space for survivors to receive support and encouragement from one another and open to anyone battling with cancer and anyone who is willing to join.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>Does cancer have a cure?<\/b>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cancer.org\/treatment\/understanding-your-diagnosis\/can-cancer-be-cured.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to the American Cancer Society, cancer has a cure but it depends on the type and stage of the cancer, the type of treatment they can get, and other factors. Some cancers are more likely to be cured than others.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"About a third of cancer can be prevented or cured. It is wrong to believe that cancer is a death sentence. Cancer could also be managed so that the quality of life will improve.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"We just need to encourage people to go for regular cancer screenings,\" said Professor Nwogu.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>But there are tons of challenges<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite its zeal to improve the quality of life of cancer patients, the nonprofit efforts are frustrated by a host of so many challenges; the chief of which is funding.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Funding to be able to assist with care at different levels is one of our biggest challenges because our funds come from donors and crowdfund,\" Professor Nwogu said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another prominent challenge is also infrastructure limitations. Nigeria currently only has four functional cancer treatment centres, which is not enough to treat the immense number of Nigerian citizens who suffer from cancer.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nigeria<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/amp\/s\/www.dataphyte.com\/latest-reports\/health\/cancer-care-costs-a-burden-too-heavy-even-for-insurance-providers\/%3famp_markup=1\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reportedly<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has only three public cancer treatment centres and in a population of more than 200 million, there are only<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/borgenproject.org\/cancer-treatment-in-nigeria\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nine<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> radiation therapy machines.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cultural and religious beliefs could also be barriers to getting treatment. Many Nigerians kick against the organisation's plea to get tested for cancer.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite all the challenges the Foundation for Cancer Care is poised to make a difference.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>And what can we learn?<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Providing help to cancer patients is indeed a huge task but one step forward is a giant one that can save lives and make a big difference in homes. For Mr. David Udo, who stepped on the thin line between life and death, Foundation for Cancer Care has given him a reason to live again.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"I had lost hope.

Since its establishment, it has continued to provide free cancer screening, diagnosis, and cancer treatment to identified patients from low socioeconomic communities.\nProfessor Chummy Nwogu, a US-based medical doctor, founded the nonprofit in 2008 with a group of experts who were interested in enhancing cancer care in West Africa.\n“We started the foundation with the primary objective to construct a cancer care centre (Lakeshore Cancer Centre) in Lagos, promotion of cancer awareness, screening and prevention, cancer patient advocacy, capacity building measures for health practitioners and fundraising to assist cancer patients to pursue treatments,” Nwogu told BONews.\nThe Lakeshore Cancer Center is Nigeria’s first operational private clinical care facility solely dedicated to cancer care and prevention.\nOn how beneficiaries are selected, the founder said after applications are received, the organisation would adopt a stringent process, to select only indigent patients, who obviously cannot afford the cost of radiography treatments.\nSo far, the foundation has conducted free cancer screenings for over 4,000 people, trained over 1,500 medical professionals in various capacities, engaged over 35 organisations in different cancer initiatives and provided funding for radiotherapy to eight cancer patients.\nOne of them is Mr. Anthony Okerafor. The Lagos-based 76-year-old man told BONews that he could not afford the treatment for radiography when he was diagnosed with cancer in 2021.\nHowever, a doctor LUTH, where he had gone for treatments, reached out to the Foundation for Cancer Care to help him secure funds to pursue his treatment. Luckily for him, the request was granted.\n“After some tests, I was asked to pay the sum of N1 million for radiotherapy. I was confused because I didn’t know how to raise that kind of money.\n“A doctor helped me to contact the nonprofit and they helped me with the sum of N460,000. My children were able to raise the balance. I am really grateful for that kind gesture.”\nSpeaking further, he noted that his doctor informed him that the treatment was successful.\nCancer patients during consultation\nMental health of cancer patients matters too\nApart from funding treatments for cancer patients, the nonprofit also provides mental health support to patients traumatised by cancer.\nIt is estimated that 20,000 cancer patients are at risk of severe mental health disorders because of cancer diagnosis, and less than two percent of these patients have ever received any professional psychological support after cancer diagnosis and during treatment.\n“The Dewdrops Support Group consists of over 100 cancer survivors from our clinic, Lakeshore Cancer Center. The foundation coordinates this group and we have quarterly meetings through which we are able to provide support to survivors,” said Ms. Tolulope Adeyoola-Oladipupo, the Programs Coordinator.\nThe group was created to create a safe space for survivors to receive support and encouragement from one another and open to anyone battling with cancer and anyone who is willing to join.\n\xa0\nDoes cancer have a cure?\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, cancer has a cure but it depends on the type and stage of the cancer, the type of treatment they can get, and other factors. Some cancers are more likely to be cured than others.\n“About a third of cancer can be prevented or cured. It is wrong to believe that cancer is a death sentence. Cancer could also be managed so that the quality of life will improve.\n“We just need to encourage people to go for regular cancer screenings,” said Professor Nwogu.\n\xa0\nBut there are tons of challenges\nDespite its zeal to improve the quality of life of cancer patients, the nonprofit efforts are frustrated by a host of so many challenges; the chief of which is funding.\n“Funding to be able to assist with care at different levels is one of our biggest challenges because our funds come from donors and crowdfund,” Professor Nwogu said.\nAnother prominent challenge is also infrastructure limitations. Nigeria currently only has four functional cancer treatment centres, which is not enough to treat the immense number of Nigerian citizens who suffer from cancer.\nNigeria reportedly has only three public cancer treatment centres and in a population of more than 200 million, there are only nine radiation therapy machines.\nCultural and religious beliefs could also be barriers to getting treatment. Many Nigerians kick against the organisation’s plea to get tested for cancer.\nDespite all the challenges the Foundation for Cancer Care is poised to make a difference.\n\xa0\nAnd what can we learn?\nProviding help to cancer patients is indeed a huge task but one step forward is a giant one that can save lives and make a big difference in homes. For Mr. David Udo, who stepped on the thin line between life and death, Foundation for Cancer Care has given him a reason to live again.\n“I had lost hope. Imagine what would have happened if the nonprofit did not sponsor my radiography treatments. I’m eternally grateful for what they did,” he said.\n\xa0\nThis story has been made possible by\xa0Nigeria Health Watch\xa0with support from the\xa0Solutions Journalism Network, a nonprofit organization dedicated to rigorous and compelling reporting about responses to social problems.\n Please rate this   Sample rating item                 \nTags: cancer careCancer treatmentFoundation for Cancer Care\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch Posts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        No Result    \n\n View All Result    \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBONews Service \n\n\n\nBONews is an online development news platform with focus on Women, Persons with Disabilities and Children.

Things started falling apart for 33-year-old David Udo when in 2020 he observed that tumours were growing around his eye and jaw.
In early 2021, he underwent a test at the Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital (ABUTH), Zaria, Kaduna State, the result, which showed that the tumor was cancerous.
Udo would lose his job because the cancerous lumps kept festering and this made him very unproductive.
Then, he began to receive medical attention at the hospital; the first treatment he underwent was chemotherapy – a drug treatment that uses powerful chemicals to kill fast-growing cells in the body. This is delivered under six cycles at an interval of 3 weeks. Each of these cycles costs around N40,000.
With all his savings gone, he had to depend on his wife and a few of his friends to cover the cost of the treatments. Notwithstanding the treatments, the tumour ruptured, leading to uncontrollable bleeding.
“The treatment seemed to have been effective but after a while, the problem kept getting worse. I was then referred to the National Hospital Abuja to undergo radiotherapy, a cancer treatment that uses high doses of radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumours” said Udo, while conversing with BONews.
Regrettably, the radiotherapy equipment at Abuja hospital were not working—a testimony to the fallen state of health care in the country.
He was, thereafter, referred to the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) Cancer Center where he was informed that radiotherapy would cost the sum of N787,000.
With no job and dependency on handouts from a few individuals, how would he afford that sum of money? This question left him devastated and according to him, “depressed and tired of life.”
According to the WHO, cancer is the rapid creation of abnormal cells that grow beyond their usual boundaries, and which can then invade adjoining parts of the body and spread to other organs.
“Human beings are made up of cells, and the cells grow and die. But when someone has cancer it means that the cells begin to grow abnormally in the body. And this could result in death,” said Dr Oge Illegbune Lakeshore, a doctor at the Lakeshore Cancer Center in Lagos.
A report by the American Society of Clinical Oncology shows that in Nigeria over 124,815 people were diagnosed with different forms of cancer in 2020. And about 72,000 Nigerians lose their lives to cancer annually.
If detected early cancer can be treated effectively, however, the cost of treatments is still very expensive and out of reach for an average Nigerian.
A report by dataphyte, a media research and data analytics organisation, shows that chemotherapy and radiotherapy costs between N600,000 to N1.5 million per session. Cancer drugs are also expensive costing as much as N300,000 per month.
This is a fortune when contrasted against the average monthly living wage for an individual in Nigeria which is a paltry sum of just N43,000.
 
Hope shines in the dark
Sometimes in 2021, distraught Udo was scrolling through his instagram feeds when he stumbled upon the Foundation for Cancer Care. He clicked on the page and found out the foundation could actually help him pay for the radiography treatment he badly needed.
Without wasting time, he sent a message and one of the officials handling the page responded to his message. From instagram, the conversation continued on WhatsApp where he passionately laid bare his challenges and the foundation promised that if his case was genuine they would seek funds to cover the cost of his treatment in Lagos.
And sooner than he expected a doctor at LUTH informed him that the cost of the radiotherapy had been covered by the nonprofit. A week after the radiation therapy, the tumour started shrinking and he stopped bleeding.
Cancer cells can disrupt organ function and may destroy healthy cells in organs which can result in death.
The removal of the tumours refueled the hope of survival in him. Mr Udo is now continuing follow-up treatments at ABUTH, Kaduna.
 
Saving cancer patients’ lives through kindness
The Foundation for Cancer Care is a non-profit organization committed to enhancing cancer care and prevention in Nigeria. Since its establishment, it has continued to provide free cancer screening, diagnosis, and cancer treatment to identified patients from low socioeconomic communities.
Professor Chummy Nwogu, a US-based medical doctor, founded the nonprofit in 2008 with a group of experts who were interested in enhancing cancer care in West Africa.
“We started the foundation with the primary objective to construct a cancer care centre (Lakeshore Cancer Centre) in Lagos, promotion of cancer awareness, screening and prevention, cancer patient advocacy, capacity building measures for health practitioners and fundraising to assist cancer patients to pursue treatments,” Nwogu told BONews.
The Lakeshore Cancer Center is Nigeria’s first operational private clinical care facility solely dedicated to cancer care and prevention.
On how beneficiaries are selected, the founder said after applications are received, the organisation would adopt a stringent process, to select only indigent patients, who obviously cannot afford the cost of radiography treatments.
So far, the foundation has conducted free cancer screenings for over 4,000 people, trained over 1,500 medical professionals in various capacities, engaged over 35 organisations in different cancer initiatives and provided funding for radiotherapy to eight cancer patients.
One of them is Mr. Anthony Okerafor. The Lagos-based 76-year-old man told BONews that he could not afford the treatment for radiography when he was diagnosed with cancer in 2021.
However, a doctor LUTH, where he had gone for treatments, reached out to the Foundation for Cancer Care to help him secure funds to pursue his treatment. Luckily for him, the request was granted.
“After some tests, I was asked to pay the sum of N1 million for radiotherapy. I was confused because I didn’t know how to raise that kind of money.
“A doctor helped me to contact the nonprofit and they helped me with the sum of N460,000. My children were able to raise the balance. I am really grateful for that kind gesture.”
Speaking further, he noted that his doctor informed him that the treatment was successful.
Cancer patients during consultation
Mental health of cancer patients matters too
Apart from funding treatments for cancer patients, the nonprofit also provides mental health support to patients traumatised by cancer.
It is estimated that 20,000 cancer patients are at risk of severe mental health disorders because of cancer diagnosis, and less than two percent of these patients have ever received any professional psychological support after cancer diagnosis and during treatment.
“The Dewdrops Support Group consists of over 100 cancer survivors from our clinic, Lakeshore Cancer Center. The foundation coordinates this group and we have quarterly meetings through which we are able to provide support to survivors,” said Ms. Tolulope Adeyoola-Oladipupo, the Programs Coordinator.
The group was created to create a safe space for survivors to receive support and encouragement from one another and open to anyone battling with cancer and anyone who is willing to join.
 
Does cancer have a cure?
According to the American Cancer Society, cancer has a cure but it depends on the type and stage of the cancer, the type of treatment they can get, and other factors. Some cancers are more likely to be cured than others.
“About a third of cancer can be prevented or cured. It is wrong to believe that cancer is a death sentence. Cancer could also be managed so that the quality of life will improve.
“We just need to encourage people to go for regular cancer screenings,” said Professor Nwogu.
 
But there are tons of challenges
Despite its zeal to improve the quality of life of cancer patients, the nonprofit efforts are frustrated by a host of so many challenges; the chief of which is funding.
“Funding to be able to assist with care at different levels is one of our biggest challenges because our funds come from donors and crowdfund,” Professor Nwogu said.
Another prominent challenge is also infrastructure limitations. Nigeria currently only has four functional cancer treatment centres, which is not enough to treat the immense number of Nigerian citizens who suffer from cancer.
Nigeria reportedly has only three public cancer treatment centres and in a population of more than 200 million, there are only nine radiation therapy machines.
Cultural and religious beliefs could also be barriers to getting treatment. Many Nigerians kick against the organisation’s plea to get tested for cancer.
Despite all the challenges the Foundation for Cancer Care is poised to make a difference.
 
And what can we learn?
Providing help to cancer patients is indeed a huge task but one step forward is a giant one that can save lives and make a big difference in homes. For Mr. David Udo, who stepped on the thin line between life and death, Foundation for Cancer Care has given him a reason to live again.
“I had lost hope. Imagine what would have happened if the nonprofit did not sponsor my radiography treatments. I’m eternally grateful for what they did,” he said.
