1001101	 2 July 2018  On 21 May 2018, the regional polio reference laboratory reported to WHO the isolation of vaccine derived poliovirus type 1 (VDPV1) from a child with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in Lae, Morobe Province, Papua New Guinea. The onset of the child’s paralysis occurred on 24 April 2018.  In response to this single case of VDPV1, enhanced surveillance and active case finding were implemented, including the collection of stool samples from household and community contacts of the index case.  On 20 June, the regional polio reference laboratory notified WHO of the isolation of VDPV1 from the stools of two healthy community contacts of the index case. These results were sent to the global polio reference laboratory at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) and it was confirmed on 21 June that these two isolates are genetically linked to the index case, indicating the circulation of poliovirus within the community.  Public health response  In response to the detection of poliovirus in the index case, mop-up vaccination was undertaken in Lae where the case lives and in Eastern Highlands Province where the case had stayed prior to onset of paralysis. In addition, medical record review and active case searching was undertaken in the affected province to identify any missed cases of AFP.  Prior to the detection of VDPV1 in contacts of the index case, preparation is underway for implementation of broader polio supplementary immunization activities as well as surveillance system strengthening in the affected province and surrounding provinces.  WHO is working with partners to support the Government of Papua New Guinea to undertake appropriate outbreak response measures in accordance with the requirements under the temporary recommendations of the International Health Regulation’s (IHR) Emergency Committee Regarding the International Spread of Poliovirus and standard operating procedures of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI).  Statement of the Seventeenth IHR Emergency Committee Regarding the International Spread of Poliovirus Temporary Recommendations to Reduce International Spread of Poliovirus WHO risk assessment  Circulating VDPVs are rare but well-documented strains of poliovirus that can emerge in some populations which are inadequately immunized.  A robust outbreak response can rapidly stop such events. Given substantial vaccination coverage gaps across the country and suboptimal surveillance for AFP and poliovirus, the risk of further spread of cVDPV within the country is deemed to be high. The emergence of cVDPV strains underscores the importance of maintaining high levels of routine vaccination coverage and effective surveillance systems for early detection.  WHO currently assesses the risk of international spread of poliovirus from Papua New Guinea to be low, as the affected province shares no international borders.  WHO emphasizes the need for a full and complete outbreak response in line with the GPEI Standard Operating Procedures: Responding to a poliovirus event or outbreak. WHO will continue to evaluate the epidemiological situation and outbreak response measures being implemented.  WHO advice  It is important that all countries, in particular those with persons who frequently travel to and have contact with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP cases to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.  WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than four weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of bivalent oral poliovirus (bOPV) or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) between four weeks and 12 months prior to international travel. International travellers undertaking urgent travel should receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure. Travellers should be provided with a written record of such vaccination, preferably using the International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis. Some polio-free countries may require travellers resident in polio affected countries to be immunized against polio in order to obtain an entry visa. The International Travel and Health country list provides a summary of country’s requirements for incoming travellers. 
1001102	21 August 2007  As of 14 August 2007, one new case of polio was reported from Bandundu province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, bringing the total number of cases in the country this year to 27. The most recent onset of paralysis was 22 June 2007.  The last supplementary immunization activities (SIA's) in this area was on 25 July; the next is scheduled to start 6 September.  For more information Global Polio Eradication Initiative 
1001103	The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO and partners continue to respond to an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD), despite persistent challenges around security and community mistrust impacting response measures. Relatively high numbers of cases were reported in recent weeks (Figure 1), mostly driven by the outbreak in Katwa Health Zone; the current focus of large scale response activities. Smaller clusters continue to be reported beyond Katwa Health Zone, including from Beni and Oicha; however, teams have quickly and systematically responded to these clusters to prevent onward transmission and guard against further geographical expansion of the outbreak. Teams are also working actively to strengthen community trust and participation in all affected areas.  As we approach six months since declaration of the outbreak, there have been a total of 752 EVD cases1 (698 confirmed and 54 probable) reported, including 465 deaths (overall case fatality ratio: 62%) as of 29 January 2019. Thus far, 259 people have been discharged from Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) and enrolled in a dedicated program for monitoring and supporting survivors. Among cases with a reported age and sex, 59% (439/750) were female, and 30% (224/749) were aged less than 18 years; including 115 children under 5 years.  During the last 21 days (9 January – 29 January 2019), 118 new cases have been reported from 11 health zones (Figure 2), including: Katwa (80), Beni (9), Butembo (7), Kayina (5), Manguredjipa (4), Oicha (4), Biena (3), Kyondo (2), Musienene (2), Komanda (1) and Vuhovi (1). In addition, five historic probable cases from Komanda Health Zone were reported during the past week with illness onset dating back to November 2018.  The outbreak in Katwa and Butembo health zones is partly being driven by nosocomial transmission events in private and public health centres. Since 1 December 2018, 86% (125/145) of cases in these areas had visited or worked in a health care facility before or after their onset of illness. Of those, 21% (30/145) reported contact with a health care facility before their onset of illness, suggesting possible nosocomial transmission. In Katwa during the past 3 weeks (since 9 January), 49 health structures were identified where confirmed cases were hospitalised, including nine health centres where nosocomial transmission potentially occurred. Moreover, during the same period, eight new health care worker (HCW) infections were reported in Katwa; overall, 65 HCWs have been infected to date. Response teams are following up with the identified health care facilities to address gaps around triage, case detection and infection prevention and control measures.  Figure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset, data as of 29 January 2019 (n=752)*  *Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning – trends during this period should be interpreted cautiously.  Figure 2: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by health zone in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, data as of 29 January 2019 (n=752)     Public health response  The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. For detailed information about the public health response actions by WHO and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:  Ebola situation reports: Democratic Republic of the Congo WHO risk assessment  WHO reviewed its risk assessment for the outbreak and the risk remains very high at the national and regional levels; the global risk level remains low. This Ebola virus outbreak is affecting north-eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo bordering Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. There is a potential risk for transmission of Ebola virus at the national and regional levels due to extensive travel between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries for economic and personal reasons as well as due to insecurity. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g. cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis, malaria), and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri at times limits the implementation of response activities.  As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.  WHO advice  International traffic: WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for passengers leaving the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

1001104	Since the last disease outbreak news published on 19 December 2019, 29 new confirmed cases were reported from 18 to 31 December in the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu province. The confirmed cases in this week were reported from eight health areas in four health zones: Mabalako (62%, n=18), Butembo (14%, n=4), Kalunguta (17%, n=5), and Katwa (7%, n=2). Three of the four cases reported in Butembo in the past 14 days are linked to a transmission chain of more than 50 people that originated in Aloya Health Area, Mabalako Health Zone. One individual classified as a relapse case of EVD, infected several other individuals within the family and through nosocomial transmission (for more information, please see the disease outbreak news published on 19 December 2019). In Kalunguta Health Zone, the five cases reported between 24 and 28 December 2019, are a distinct epidemiologically linked chain of transmission, although the source of exposure is currently under investigation.  In the past 21 days (11 December to 31 December), 40 confirmed cases were reported from 10 health areas within five neighbouring active health zones in North Kivu province (Figure 2, Table 1): Mabalako (68%, n=27), Butembo (13%, n=5), Kalunguta (13%, n=5), Katwa (5%, n=2), and Biena (3%, n=1). The majority of the cases (75%, n=30) are linked to known chains of transmission.   As of 31 December, a total of 3380 EVD cases were reported, including 3262 confirmed and 118 probable cases, of which 2232 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%) (Table 1). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1900) were female, 28% (n=953) were children aged less than 18 years, and 168 (5% of all reported cases) were healthcare workers.

1001105	07 April 1999 Disease Outbreak Reported  The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have confirmed that of the 15 blood samples from abattoir workers received from Singapore for testing, 11 (including 1 death) tested positive for Hendra-like virus. No additional cases have been reported in Singapore during the past two weeks and the outbreak there has now ended.  The outbreak of encephalitis is still ongoing in Malaysia. For up-to-date information on the number of cases and deaths, please see the web site of the Department of Public Health, Ministry of Health, Malaysia at: http://dph.gov.my/press/press2/cases.htm  The Hendra-like virus is a new virus. It is similar to the Hendra virus which was responsible for the deaths of two humans and some race horses in Australia in 1994. However, genetic analysis of the new virus shows significant differences. Experts at CDC have noted that transmission of the virus has been confined to persons who have had direct contact with infected pigs. Currently, there is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. Travellers to Malaysia should be aware of this outbreak of febrile encephalitis, which thus far has involved only those closely associated with pig farms. No travel restrictions are indicated at this time.  A report of the outbreak can be found in the article, " Outbreak of Hendra-Like Virus - Malaysia and Singapore, 1998-1999" in MMWR, April 9, 1999 48(13); 265-269 at: http://www.cdc.gov/epo/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00056866.htm 
1001106	No new cases have been reported in the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 17 February 2020 (Figure 1). However, due to challenges related to continued insecurity and population displacement in previous hotspots, limited access to some affected communities, and potential shortages of resources amidst other local and global emergencies, there remains a high risk of re-emergence of the virus. Therefore, it is critical to maintain surveillance and response operations in the period leading up to the declaration of the end of the outbreak, as well as after the declaration – as outlined in the WHO recommended criteria for declaring the end of the EVD outbreak.  Active outbreak response activities continue, which include investigating and validating new alert cases, supporting appropriate care and rapid diagnosis of suspected cases (which continue to be detected), supporting survivors through a multi-disciplinary programme, and strategically transitioning activities. From 18 to 24 March, an average of 4619 alerts were reported and investigated daily. Of these alerts, 358 were validated as suspected cases, requiring specialized care and laboratory testing to rule-out EVD. From 16 to 22 March, 2747 samples were tested including: 1479 blood samples from alive, suspected cases; 374 swabs from community deaths; and 894 samples from re-tested patients. Overall, laboratory activity was conducted at similar levels as compared to the prior week.  Last week, nine historical probable cases were validated, whose dates of symptom onset were between October 2018 and July 2019, bringing the cumulative number of probable cases to 143. Further historical probable cases are expected to be validated as investigations into past cases continue.  As of 24 March 2020, a total of 3453 EVD cases were reported from 29 health zones (Table 1), including 3310 confirmed and 143 probable cases, of which 2273 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 57% (n=1935) were female, 29% (n=979) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=171) were health care workers.  WHO has not received funding for the Ebola response since December 2019. An urgent injection of US $20 million is required to ensure that response teams have the capacity to maintain the appropriate level of operations through to the beginning of May 2020. If no new resources are received, WHO risks running out of funds for the Ebola response before the end of the outbreak. For more information, please see this statement.

1001107	18 October 2002 Disease Outbreak Reported  As of 17 October, the Ministry of Health has confirmed 18 cases and 2 deaths of yellow fever. The outbreak has affected Touba, Mbacké and Bambey départements, Diourbel region and Gossas département, Fatick region (see previous report). Laboratory confirmation was made by the WHO Collaborating Centre at the Institut Pasteur in Dakar. Fifteen of the cases were reported from Touba.  A mass immunization campaign began on 1 October and a total of 800,000 people have been vaccinated in the following 4 health districts: Touba, Diourbel, Bambey, and Mbacké . An assessment by WHO indicates that the campaigns are proceeding well, but additional vaccine is urgently needed to complete the immunization program.  A second campaign for spraying insecticide in the city of Touba was conducted by the National Service of Hygiene between 15-17 October. Entomological studies in Touba found high indices of Aedes aegypti, the mosquito responsible for explosive epidemics of urban yellow fever. As a result, vector control activities will also include larviciding and health education programs for removing mosquito breeding sites.  Health units throughout the country have been notified to increase surveillance for yellow fever. The units have been instructed to report to the central level within 24 hours, all cases fitting a standard case definition. Particular emphasis is focused on strengthening surveillance and vector control in Dakar. Teams with staff from the Ministry of Health, Institut Pasteur-Dakar, and WHO are conducting surveillance and case investigation activities. Samples from over 150 suspect cases have been sent to laboratories for testing.  WHO is assisting the Ministry of Health in the areas of surveillance, immunization and coordination of the response to the outbreak. WHO has also contacted potential donors for assistance with purchasing vaccine. 
1001108	29 November 2002 Disease Outbreak Reported  As of 22 November, over 4,000 cases of acute respiratory illness, including approximately 500 deaths, have been preliminarily reported since October from Bosobolo (Equateur Province), Democratic Republic of the Congo. The clinical features of the illness include rhinorrhea, headache, arthralgia and respiratory insufficiency. Laboratory confirmation of the cause of this outbreak is pending.  Access to, and communications with the affected area is difficult. Currently, Médecins sans Frontières (MSF-France), Epicentre and WHO are supporting the Ministry of Health in investigating this outbreak and providing medical services. 
1001109	 8 January 2019  As of October 2018, genetically-linked circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) isolates were detected in two cases from Haut-Katanga province (Mufunga-Sampwe district) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The first case was a 11-year old child who experienced onset of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) on 6 October. The second case was a 29-month old child who experienced onset of symptoms on 7 October, and is a known contact of the first case. The isolated viruses are a new emergence and unrelated to previously-detected cVDPV2s affecting the country. This is the fourth distinct outbreak of cVDPV2 detected in the country since June 2017. In total, 42 cVDPV2 cases have now been confirmed since detection of the first outbreak in June 2017, 20 cases of which were detected in 2018.  Public health response  In February 2018, the government declared cVDPV2 to be a national public health emergency. On 26 July 2018, the Minister of Health, WHO Director General, the Regional Director for Africa, and provincial governors convened an urgent, high-level meeting and signed the ‘Kinshasa Declaration for Polio Eradication’. Provincial governors pledged to provide the necessary oversight, accountability and resources required to urgently improve the quality of the outbreak response being implemented across the country. It is imperative that the remaining operational gaps in outbreak response are urgently filled with the appropriate oversight and engagement.  WHO and partners are responding in accordance with international outbreak response protocols including through administration of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2). However, operational gaps such as the under-immunization of high-risk populations, continue to hamper the full implementation of these protocols. Thus, the response so far has not adequately controlled the outbreak nor prevented its spread. The recent emergence of the fourth outbreak of cVDPV2 from Haut Katanga can potentially be attributed to the prior use of mOPV2 and may be related to the response program’s current limited capacity to adapt effectively and implement necessary corrective measures in a timely manner.  With the evidence of geographic spread of some of these strains and emergence of the new strain, two large scale rounds of mOPV2 were administered in September 2018 and October 2018 targeting around 12 million children in 16 of 26 provinces of the country. Surveillance and immunization activities continue to be strengthened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighboring countries.  The polio outbreak response is being conducted simultaneously to the ongoing Ebola outbreak affecting North Kivu province to the east of the country. Polio outbreak response teams are coordinating closely with the broader humanitarian emergency network, to ensure both outbreaks are addressed in a coordinated manner.  WHO risk assessment  Currently, WHO finds the overall national public health risk associated with these four outbreaks to be very high. The risk of international spread, particularly to the neighboring countries also remains high due to the continuation of these outbreaks close to international borders. This risk is magnified by known population movements between the affected areas of Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Central African Republic, Zambia and South Sudan.  As of July 2018, in light of the epidemiology of the reported polio cases, genetic analyses of the isolated polioviruses, risk of further in-country and international spread, and the country’s response capacity, the outbreak has been graded as a Grade 2 public health emergency based on the WHO Emergency Response Framework.  The detection of cVDPV2s underscores the importance of maintaining high routine vaccination coverage to minimize the risk and consequences of poliovirus circulation. These events also highlight the risks posed by any low-level transmission of the virus. A robust outbreak response is necessary to impede further disease transmission, ensure sufficient vaccination coverage in the affected areas, and prevent similar outbreaks in the future. WHO will continue to monitor and evaluate the epidemiological situation and outbreak response measures being implemented.  WHO advice  It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.  WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travelers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents and visitors staying for more than four- weeks in affected areas should receive an additional dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV) or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within four weeks to 12 months of travel. Efforts should also be made to ensure that individuals who received vaccinations are provided the appropriate documentation to record their vaccination status.  As per the advice of the Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), efforts to limit the international spread of poliovirus must continue as it remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country affected by poliovirus transmission should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency.  At this time, WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel and/or trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the basis of the information available for the current cVDPV2 outbreaks.  Cross border activities should be conducted between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighboring countries to strengthen AFP surveillance and routine immunization as well as operations linked to the control of other vaccine preventable diseases. Direct and regular collaboration between neighboring provinces and districts should begin quickly awaiting formal administrative and political address.

1001110	21 January 1997 Disease Outbreak Reported  As at 20 January 1997, a total of 60 cases of Ebola haemorrhagic fever with 45 deaths had been reported in the outbreak which started at the end of July 1997. The last death was a 17-month-old child who was a member of the family known to have been contacts of a previous case in Booué area. The child developed fever on 15 January and died on 18 January. His grandmother who was caring for him has been hospitalised in Libreville for close monitoring but remains asymptomatic. As of this date, 15 cases had recovered from illness. Forty-seven contacts were still being followed up in Libreville while all contacts in Booué had been removed from surveillance. 
1001111	22 June 2011 - The Ministry of Health of Egypt has notified WHO of a new case of human infection with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus.  The case is a 27 year-old male from Qena governorate, Deshna district. He developed symptoms on 5 June 2011, was hospitalized and was put on oseltamivir treatment on 13 June. He died on 14 June 2011.  Investigations into the source of infection indicate that the case had exposure to poultry suspected to have avian influenza.  The case was confirmed by the Egyptian sub-national laboratory for Influenza in Aswan and the Central Public Health Laboratories in Cairo, a National Influenza Centre of the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network.  Of the 150 cases confirmed to date in Egypt, 52 have been fatal. 
1001112	2 June 2004  A cluster of Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) cases marked by a distinctive pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern has been identified in the United States and traced to consumption of natural raw almonds.  To date, 32 cases have been identified with onsets between March 2003 and April 2004. These almonds (from Paramount Farms, California, USA) were sold across the United States under several brands and exported to China, Province of Taiwan, Democratic Republic of Korea, France, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico and the United Kingdom.  The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recalled the product and notified those countries who received the almonds. (For more information, see the FDA web site ). Several United States health authorities are involved in the ongoing investigations.  Salmonellosis outbreaks linked to almonds are rare and have only been associated with almonds consumed in their raw state, without further processing. 
1001113	Situation in China and Hong Kong, status of diagnostic tests  17 April 2003  Disease Outbreak Reported  China Chinese authorities have today reported 12 new cases of SARS. Nine new cases were reported from Guangdong Province, and one each in Inner Mongolia and Sichuan Province. Ningxia, a poor province in the remote western part of the country, announced its first case today.  Beijing reported no new cases and no new deaths.  Today’s figures do not include cases in Beijing’s military hospitals. The military hospitals, which are not obliged by Chinese law to report cases to health authorities, have been the focus of considerable rumours over the past several days. A WHO team began visits to Beijing’s military hospitals yesterday.  The recent decision of military hospitals in Guangdong Province to report SARS cases to the authorities may set an important precedent. WHO staff in China have been further encouraged by the presence of national surveillance and reporting teams in provinces that are now reporting cases. The presence of national SARS teams actively searching for cases is a welcome sign that the severity of the SARS threat is being taken seriously by the government.  An additional WHO team will be travelling to Shanghai next week.  Hong Kong: investigation of the Amoy Gardens cluster The Hong Kong Department of Health, together with the Department of Environment, Transport and Works, has today released the results of an extensive investigation into the possible cause of a large cluster of SARS cases among residents in the Amoy Gardens housing estate. The report draws on findings from numerous studies designed to determine whether an environmental source of the SARS virus might explain the large and unusual cluster of SARS cases.  As of 15 April, health authorities had reported a total of 321 individuals affected by SARS who are residents in Amoy Gardens. A large proportion of cases are concentrated in vertically linked flats in a single building, Block E.  Attention has focused on possible transmission via the sewage system. Among several unusual features, the Amoy cluster includes a high proportion of cases presenting with diarrhoea, estimated at about 60%. In most other clusters of cases, diarrhoea has typically been seen in only 2% to 7% of cases.  WHO epidemiologists are now studying the report, which was submitted to WHO earlier today by Hong Kong’s Department of Health.  Status of diagnostic tests Scientists in the WHO network of collaborating laboratories met in Geneva yesterday to map out research priorities for the coming month. The network also announced conclusive proof, from animal trials, that a new coronavirus, discovered by the group last month, is the agent that causes SARS.  With the cause of SARS now proven, network scientists are giving top priority to the development of better diagnostic tests. The first step is the development of a data bank of specimens from a range of SARS patients in different countries. The scientists are also building a bank of specimens taken from individual patients at different stages of disease, including recovery.  Such a time-series of specimens will be vital in developing a test that is capable of detecting virus at the first stage when people become capable of infecting others. It will also help determine the stage in the course of the illness when recovered patients can safely return to their jobs and families with no risk of infecting others.  Other plans for the coming weeks include the development of a genetic library of specimens from SARS patients from different parts of the world. It is not yet known whether genetic differences in the coronavirus, which has now been fully sequenced by several network laboratories, will have significance for work on drug and vaccine research and development.  Existing PCR diagnostic tests are insufficiently powerful to rule out, with confidence, the presence of the virus in suspect or probable SARS cases early in the course of the disease.  WHO has been concerned that use of the current PCR test kit, which is being made available by a German biotechnology company initially at no cost, may produce test results that give a false sense of security, allowing persons carrying the virus to slip past undetected.  Without a more reliable diagnostic tool, hospital staff confronted with a suspect SARS case have no option other than to isolate patients and manage them according to strict infection control practices as precautionary measures. Such measures are stressful for patients and place a considerable strain on health services.  Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 3389 cases with 165 deaths have been reported from twenty five countries. Countries reporting their first probable cases on today’s list include Australia (3) and Mongolia (3).  A large number of suspect SARS cases turn out, on further investigation, to have other, common causes. 
1001114	Disease outbreak news  19 October 2013 - On 17 October 2013, WHO received reports of a cluster of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases in the Syrian Arab Republic. This cluster of ‘hot’ AFP was detected in early October 2013 in Deir Al Zour province and is currently being investigated. Initial results from the national polio laboratory in Damascus indicate that two of the cases could be positive for polio – final results are awaited from the regional reference laboratory of the Eastern Mediterranean Region of WHO. Wild poliovirus was last reported in Syria in 1999.  The Ministry of Health of the Syrian Arab Republic confirms that it is treating this event as a cluster of ‘hot’ AFP cases, pending final laboratory confirmation, and an urgent response is currently being planned across the country. Syria is considered at high-risk for polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases due to the current situation.  A surveillance alert has been issued for the region to actively search for additional potential cases. Supplementary immunization activities in neighbouring countries are currently being planned.  WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travelers to and from polio-infected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. 
1001115	 27 November 2015  The Ministry of Health (MoH) of Brazil has provided PAHO/WHO with an update regarding the unusual increase in the number of cases of microcephaly among newborns in the northeast of Brazil.  As of 21 November, a total of 739 cases of microcephaly were being investigated in nine states in the northeast of Brazil. The distribution of the cases was as follows: Pernambuco (487 cases), Paraíba (96 cases), Sergipe (54 cases), Rio Grande do Norte (47 cases), Piauí (27 cases), Alagoas (10 cases), Ceará (9 cases), Bahia (8 cases) and Goiás (1 case). One fatal case was reported in the state of Rio Grande do Norte.  Public health response  In response to the situation, the MoH has taken the following actions:  disseminating information to health professionals on measures to be taken. disseminating information to the population, especially pregnant women, to receive prenatal care and complete all tests recommended by their doctors. disseminating information about established reference healthcare services and patient care flow in each Federation Unit. strengthening vector prevention and control in urban and peri-urban areas, in accordance with the National Guidelines of the National Program for Dengue Control.  PAHO/WHO and the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) is deploying technical experts to assist the MoH in various areas, including arbovirus virology, epidemiology and disease surveillance.  WHO advice  Although the cause of this event is yet to be determined, information is being shared with Member States to raise awareness of the situation and to alert countries for similar events in their territories. For these reasons and to further the understanding of the etiology of this event, PAHO/WHO urges Member States to report any increase of microcephaly or other neurological disorders in newborns that cannot be explained by known causes. Recommendations by PAHO/WHO are available in the Epidemiological Alert (see related links). 
1001116	 26 June 2015  On 21 June 2015, the National IHR Focal Point of the United Arab Emirates notified WHO of 2 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.  Details of the cases are as follows: A 46-year-old, non-national female from the Eastern region was identified through contact screening as she is a family member of a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case reported in a previous DON on 16 June. The patient, who has comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on 18 June. She has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to detection. Currently, she is still asymptomatic in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward. An 11-year-old, non-national male from the Eastern region was identified through contact screening as he is a family member of a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case reported in a previous DON on 16 June. The patient, who has no comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on 18 June. He has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to detection. Currently, the patient is asymptomatic in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward.  Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases.  The National IHR Focal Point of the United Arab Emirates also notified WHO of the death of the MERS-CoV case that was reported in a previous DON on 16 June.  Globally, WHO has been notified of 1,350 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 480 related deaths.  WHO advice  Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.  Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.  Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.  Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.  WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions. 
1001117	20 December 1996 Disease Outbreak Reported  Recent cases of Ebola haemorrhagic fever have been identified in the village of Djidji in the Booué area. This village was affected already in October and the recent cases are directly linked to that outbreak. Seven deaths had occurred unreported until the last death which occurred on 16 December. Several teams have been mobilized to trace contacts in Booué, Latourville and Libreville. 
1001118	 25 February 2016  On 23 February 2016, the Department of Health (DH), Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) notified WHO of an additional laboratory-confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus.  The patient, a resident of Hong Kong SAR, China, is a 60-year-old man with previously good health condition. On February 8, he developed symptoms and, on 11 February, consulted a private doctor. The patient was then admitted to hospital. His nasopharyngeal aspirate collected on 12 February initially tested negative for influenza A virus. On 15 February, the patient was discharged. On 23 February, re-testing of the sample taken on 12 February tested positive for influenza A (H7N9). He was re-admitted to hospital for isolation and is currently in stable condition.  Preliminary epidemiological investigations revealed that the patient worked in Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China. He returned to Hong Kong SAR, China on 5 February. During his stay in Suzhou, the patient visited a wet market but denied having any direct contact with poultry during the incubation period. The DH is communicating with the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China to investigate the source of his infection.  According to available information, this case is likely to have been infected in Jiangsu Province. The DH is tracing close contacts of the patient and Tamiflu chemoprophylaxis will be prescribed to those contacts. On February 22, the patient's afebrile son developed sore throat and, on February 23, he was admitted to hospital for observation. The patient’s wife remains asymptomatic. Investigations are ongoing.  WHO risk assessment  WHO is assessing the epidemiological situation and conducting further risk assessment based on the latest information. Based on the information received thus far, the overall public health risk from avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses has not changed.  If the pattern of human cases follows the trends seen in previous years, the number of human cases may rise over the coming months. Further sporadic cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus are expected in affected and possibly in the neighboring areas. Should human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travels or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is considered unlikely as the virus has not demonstrated the ability to transmit easily among humans.  WHO advice  WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, contact with animals in live bird markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.  WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.  WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions. 
1001119	 6 July 2016  Between 21 June and 30 June 2016, the National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia notified WHO of 13 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including 1 death.  Details of the cases A 38-year-old, non-national male from Al Aqiq city developed symptoms on 23 June and was admitted to a hospital on 27 June.

A 66-year-old male from Jeddah city developed symptoms on 16 June and was admitted to a hospital on 17 June. The patient, who has comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on 19 June. Investigation of history of exposure to any of the known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing. Currently the patient is in critical condition in ICU.  Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases.  The National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia also notified WHO of the death of 3 MERS-CoV case that were reported in previous DONs on 21 June (case no. 6) and 19 June (case no. 2 and 6).  Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1,782 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 634 related deaths.  WHO risk assessment  MERS-CoV causes severe human infections resulting in high mortality and has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.  The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.  WHO advice  Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.  Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.  Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.  Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.  Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. Raising awareness about MERS-CoV among travellers to and from affected countries is good public health practice. 
1001120	 26 April 2016  On 19 April 2016, the Department of Health, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region notified WHO of a confirmed, imported case of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.  The patient is an 80-year-old man with underlying illnesses, travelled to Dongguan, Guangdong province from 1 to 5 April. He developed productive cough, headache and a gout attack on 6 April. On 14 April, he developed fever, and by 17 April was experiencing disorientation. He went to hospital the same day and was subsequently admitted for management of pneumonia.  On 19 April, he tested positive for avian influenza A(H7N9) virus following laboratory testing at the Public Health Laboratory Services Branch of the Centre for Health Protection (CHP). The patient is now in stable condition and will be transferred to a different hospital for further management  Initial investigations by the CHP revealed that the patient had purchased a live chicken from a wet market close to where he stayed during his time in Mainland China. He slaughtered the chicken on 3 April.  Public health response  The Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health is continuing investigation, as well as tracing and monitoring close contacts of the case.  WHO risk assessment  Most human cases are exposed to the A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, further human cases can be expected. Although small clusters of human cases with influenza A(H7N9) viruses have been reported including those involving healthcare workers, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore further community level spread is considered unlikely.  Human infections with the A(H7N9) virus are unusual and need to be monitored closely in order to identify changes in the virus and/or its transmission behaviour to humans as it may have a serious public health impact.  WHO advice  WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, contact with animals in live bird markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.  WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.  WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions. 
1001121	09 January 1998 Disease Outbreak Reported  The Department of Health has informed today that there are no new cases of influenza A(H5N1) since the 16th case was confirmed on 3 January. One suspect case remains under investigation. 
1001122	 21 November 2014  On 4 November 2014, WHO was notified by the Ministry of Health of Madagascar of an outbreak of plague. The first case, a male from Soamahatamana village in the district of Tsiroanomandidy, was identified on 31 August. The patient died on 3 September.  As of 16 November, a total of 119 cases of plague have been confirmed, including 40 deaths. Only 2% of reported cases are of the pneumonic form.  Cases have been reported in 16 districts of seven regions. Antananarivo, the capital and largest city in Madagascar, has also been affected with 2 recorded cases of plague, including 1 death. There is now a risk of a rapid spread of the disease due to the city’s high population density and the weakness of the healthcare system. The situation is further complicated by the high level of resistance to deltamethrin (an insecticide used to control fleas) that has been observed in the country.  Public health response  The national task force has been activated to manage the outbreak. With support from partners – including WHO, the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar, the “Commune urbaine d’Antananarivo” and the Red Cross – the government of Madagascar has put in place effective strategies to control the outbreak. Thanks to financial assistance from the African Development Bank, a 200,000 US dollars response project has been developed. WHO is providing technical expertise and human resources support. Measures for the control and prevention of plague are being thoroughly implemented in the affected districts. Personal protective equipment, insecticides, spray materials and antibiotics have been made available in those areas.  Background  Plague is a bacterial disease caused by Yersinia pestis, which primarily affects wild rodents. It is spread from one rodent to another by fleas. Humans bitten by an infected flea usually develop a bubonic form of plague, which produces the characteristic plague bubo (a swelling of the lymph node). If the bacteria reach the lungs, the patient develops pneumonia (pneumonic plague), which is then transmissible from person to person through infected droplets spread by coughing. If diagnosed early, bubonic plague can be successfully treated with antibiotics. Pneumonic plague, on the other hand, is one of the most deadly infectious diseases; patients can die 24 hours after infection. The mortality rate depends on how soon treatment is started, but is always very high.  WHO recommendations  WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction based on the current information available. In urban areas, such as Antananarivo, the surveillance of epidemic risk indicators is highly recommended for the implementation of preventive vector control activities. 
1001123	4 April 2006  The Ministry of Health in Indonesia has confirmed an additional case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The case, which was fatal, occurred in a 20-month-old girl who resided in Kapuk, West Jakarta. She developed symptoms of fever and cough on 17 March, was hospitalized on 22 March, and died on 23 March.  Field investigation found a history of deaths in a chicken flock near her home about one week prior to symptom onset. Chicken deaths in the neighbourhood have continued, but the cause has not yet been identified. Family members and neighbours have been placed under observation and samples from these people have been taken for testing. Preliminary results are negative, but follow-up investigation is continuing.  The newly confirmed case brings the total in Indonesia to 30. Of these cases, 23 were fatal. 
1001124	Situation at a glance   On 11 May 2022, Germany notified WHO of one laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with a swine-origin influenza A(H1N1) virus in North Rhine-Westphalia, in the west of Germany. The case was detected during routine sentinel surveillance for influenza. No further cases have been reported in connection to this case and the patient has fully recovered. Although infections with A(H1N1) variant viruses occasionally occur, it is still considered a rare and unusual event.   Description of the case   On 11 May 2022, Germany notified WHO of one laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with a swine-origin influenza A(H1N1) virus in North Rhine-Westphalia state, Germany. The case is an adult aged 30-40 years, who was detected during routine sentinel surveillance for influenza. On 21 March, the case developed influenza-like illness symptoms including fever, cough, sore throat, headache and muscle pain. On 24 March, a nasal swab sample was collected, and on 29 March, influenza A virus was detected.   The sample was tested at the National Influenza Centre at the Robert Koch Institute in Germany. Influenza A virus was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). On 5 May, whole genome sequencing pointed to a Eurasian avian-like swine A(H1N1) virus. Further virus characterization is underway.   The case was not hospitalized and has since recovered. Although the case had no direct contact with swine, the individual lived in a region with many swine farms and had contacts who were swine farmers.   Epidemiology of the disease   Influenza A(H1) viruses are enzootic in swine populations in most regions of the world. Human cases of infection with swine influenza viruses have sporadically been detected in several countries in Europe in recent years, of whom most had reported exposure to swine. Influenza A viruses in swine do not usually infect humans because influenza viruses that infect pigs may be different from human influenza viruses. Thus, influenza vaccines made against human influenza viruses are generally not expected to protect people from influenza viruses that normally circulate in pigs. When an influenza virus that normally circulates in swine is detected in a person, it is called a “variant influenza virus”. Sporadic human infections with variant viruses have been reported, usually after direct or indirect exposure to pigs or contaminated environments. Human infections with variant viruses tend to result in mild clinical illness, although some cases have been hospitalized with more severe disease and some have been fatal.   There have been several influenza A(H1) virus infections detected in Europe in recent years. Although infections with A(H1N1) variant virus occasionally occur, it is still considered a rare and unusual event.   Public health response  The German health authorities contacted family members of the case and offered serological tests to close contacts, including a circle of friends who are in the farming community. Authorities are also conducting retrospective epidemiological investigation. No other measures were implemented by the German authorities because the case has recovered and there is currently no evidence of ongoing transmission.   WHO risk assessment  Based on currently available information, this is a sporadic case and there is no evidence of disease spread so far. WHO assesses the risk to the general population posed by this virus to be low and the risk to occupationally exposed persons to be low-to-moderate. As the investigations are still being conducted by the national authority, the risk level will be amended accordingly if warranted.   Pigs are susceptible to avian, human and swine influenza viruses; they potentially may be infected with influenza viruses from different species at the same time. If this happens, it is possible for the genes of these viruses to mix and create a new virus. This type of major change in the influenza A viruses is known as antigenic shift. If this new virus causes illness in people and can be transmitted easily from person-to-person with no population immunity, an influenza pandemic may occur.   Should individuals infected with a variant influenza virus travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during travel or after arrival. If this were to occur, further community level spread is considered unlikely as this virus has not acquired the ability to transmit easily among humans.   WHO advice  Surveillance:   This case does not change the current WHO recommendations on public health measures and surveillance of seasonal influenza.   WHO does not advise special traveler screening at points of entry or restrictions with regard to the current situation of influenza viruses at the human-animal interface.   Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.   Notification and investigation:   All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR) and State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required.   In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection caused by a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, including a variant virus, a thorough epidemiologic investigation of history of exposure to animals, of travel, and contact tracing should be conducted. The epidemiologic investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus. Clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Center for further characterization.   Travel and trade:   WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and/or trade for Germany based on the currently available information.   Prevention measures for travelers:   Travelers to countries with known outbreaks of animal influenza should avoid farms, contact with animals in live animal markets, entering areas where animals may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with animal feces.

1001125	27 July 1999 Disease Outbreak Reported  Since 18 June a number of sporadic suspect cases of plague have occurred in Nsanje district, Southern Region. Up to 21 July, 74 suspect cases had been reported from a total of 22 villages. Six villages along the Mozambican border were the most affected reporting around 3 to 4 suspect cases each. Some of the other villages reported only one suspect case each. The treatment of patients is under way as well as environmental control measures which include spraying and dusting of affected and surrounding housing areas, health education on proper storage of foodstuffs and refuse disposal. The situation was being handled effectively by the Ministry of Health but drug supplies have been depleted and more may be needed. WHO has offered its assistance to the national health authorities.  The last outbreak of plague in Malawi was in 1997 when a total of 582 cases were reported including cases in Nsanje, Chikwawa and Ntchisi Districts, all in Southern Region.    
1001126	26 April 2002 Disease Outbreak Reported  The Greek Ministry of Health and Welfare has reported that preliminary laboratory results suggest that the etiologic agent associated with the outbreak in Greece (see previous report) belongs to the enterovirus family.  The health authorities have provided instructions on personal hygiene and as a precautionary measure closed all schools for 3 days before the planned Greek Easter holidays.  WHO recommends no special restrictions on travel or trade to or from Greece.  
1001127	7 March 2011 - The Ministry of Health of Egypt has announced two new confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus.  The first case is a 32 year old female from Sharkia Governorate. She developed symptoms on 10 February and was hospitalized on 14 February. She is in a critical condition.  The second case is a two year old male from Kafr Elsheikh Governorate. He developed symptoms on 18 February and was hospitalized on 20 February. He is under treatment and is in a good general condition.  Investigations into the source of infection indicate that the two cases had exposure to poultry suspected to have avian influenza.  The cases were confirmed by the Egyptian Central Public Health Laboratory, a National Influenza Center of the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network.  Of the 127 cases confirmed to date in Egypt, 41 have been fatal. 
1001128	25 November 2003  Disease Outbreak Reported  As of 24 November 2003, the Ministry of Health of the Republic of the Congo has reported a total of 36 cases, including 18 deaths, of Ebola haemorrhagic fever (EHF) in Mbomo (33 cases, 15 deaths) and Mbandza (3 cases, 3 deaths); villages located in Mbomo district, Cuvette Ouest Department (See previous report).  The WHO Regional Office for Africa sub-regional epidemic response team for West Africa, staff from the WHO Country Office in Brazzaville, and Médecins sans Frontières (MSF-Holland) continue to support the Ministry of Health in Mbomo district. An isolation facility has been established, and contact tracing and social mobilization activities with communities in the region are ongoing. 
1001129	25 January 2011 - On 3 January 2011, the Minister of Health in Côte d'Ivoire notified WHO of a yellow fever outbreak in the north of the country. As of January 17, 2011 a total of 12 cases tested IgM positive by ELISA at the Institut Pasteur of Abidjan and were subsequently confirmed positive for yellow fever by the regional reference laboratory, the Institut Pasteur of Dakar (by ELISA and PRNT). These cases originate from Béoumi and Katiola districts, in the Bandama Valley Region in the centre of the country, and Séguéla and Mankono in the Worodougou Region in the north of the country.  In response to this outbreak, a field investigation was conducted in Béoumi and Katiola districts from 10 to 15 January 2011 by the Ministry of Health with support from the WHO country office. During this investigation a total of 64 suspected cases, including 25 deaths, were identified. Further laboratory testing is on-going.  On 22 January, the Ministry of Health of Cote d'Ivoire started an emergency vaccination campaign targeting over 840,000 people aged nine months and older in Béoumi, Katiola, Mankono and Séguéla districts, with support from WHO and UNICEF. GAVI-funded vaccines released by the International Coordinating Group on Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG) for the 2010 country mass preventive campaign will be used. The four districts were part of the 61 districts chosen for the preventive campaign, which could not be conducted last year due to the political situation. 
1001130	26 July 2000 Disease Outbreak Reported  The 48 year-old surgeon who was infected with Lassa fever virus while working in Kenema, Sierra Leone died on 25 July in Leiden University Hospital, The Netherlands where he was being treated. He was initially treated for malaria in Sierra Leone on 11 July, and then traveled to The Netherlands (arrived 14 July) to visit relatives. He was admitted to the hospital on 15 July. Lassa fever was suspected when his condition worsened on 20 July and treatment with ribavirin was started. On 22 July, the Bernard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, Germany reported that Lassa virus was detected in a blood sample sent for diagnostic testing.  While the risk of infection for those who traveled with this person from Freetown to Amsterdam is minimal, potential contacts are being traced and monitored in both The Netherlands as well as in Africa.  As mentioned in the 25 July posting, this is the fourth case of Lassa fever imported into Europe this year: see previous reports, 4 April, 14 March, 13 March, 18 January and 13 January. All four patients have died although the death of one case was not the direct result of the acute infection. 
1001131	 1 May 2017  On 21 April 2017, the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China (NHFPC) notified WHO of 28 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in mainland China.  Details of the cases  Onset dates ranged from 22 March to 18 April 2017. Of these 28 cases, 11 were female. The median age is 55 years old (age range among the cases is 34 to 79 years old). The cases were reported from Anhui (1), Beijing (7), Gansu (1), Guangxi (1), Hebei (4), Hunan (5), Jiangxi (1), Liaoning (1), Shandong (2), Sichuan (3), and Zhejiang (2).  At the time of notification, of the 27 cases with information on medical condition, there were eight deaths, 17 cases were diagnosed as having either pneumonia (4) or severe pneumonia (13), and two cases were diagnosed as mild. Twenty-two cases were reported to have had exposure to poultry or live poultry market. One was reported to have had no known poultry exposure, and one was reported to have exposure to a person who had severe pneumonia and later died (but there was no indication the illness and death were related to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection). At the time of notification, there was no information available regarding poultry exposure for four cases. No clusters of cases were reported.  To date, a total of 1421 laboratory-confirmed human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported through IHR notification since early 2013.  Public health response  Considering the increase in the number of human cases since December 2016, the Chinese government at national and local levels is taking further measures which include:  Strengthening the risk assessment and prevention and control guidance for the northern provinces which had reported increasing cases. Continuing to strengthen control measures with focus on hygienic management of live poultry markets and cross-regional transportation. Carrying out detailed source investigations to inform effective prevention and control measures. Continuing to detect and treat human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) cases early to reduce mortality. Continuing to carry out risk communication and information publicity to provide the public with guidance on self-protection. Strengthening the virology surveillance, to define the scope of virus contamination and mutations, in order to provide further guidance for prevention and control. WHO risk assessment  The number of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) in the fifth epidemic wave (i.e. onset since 1 October 2016) is greater than the numbers of human cases reported in earlier waves.  Human infections with the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus remain unusual. Close observation of the epidemiological situation and further characterization of the most recent human viruses are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner.  Most human cases are exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, and live poultry vending continues, further human cases can be expected. Although small clusters of cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported including those involving patients in the same ward, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore the likelihood of further community level spread is considered low.  WHO advice  WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid, if possible, poultry farms, contact with animals in live poultry markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water, and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.  WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling in or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.  WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR 2005, and continue national health preparedness actions. 
1001132	 19 July 2014  Epidemiology and surveillance  WHO continues to monitor the evolution of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea. The current epidemic trend of EVD outbreak in Sierra Leone and Liberia remains serious, with 67 new cases and 19 deaths reported from 15 – 17 July 2014. These include suspect, probable, and laboratory-confirmed cases. The EVD outbreak in Guinea continues to show a declining trend, with no new cases reported during this period. Critical analyses and review of the current outbreak response is being undertaken to inform the process of developing prioritized national operational plans. Effective implementation of the prioritized plans will be vital in reversing the current trend of EVD outbreak, especially in Liberia and Sierra Leone.  Health sector response  WHO has been working with national authorities and partners in the affected countries to analyse and review the current outbreak response. An assessment of the outbreak response conducted in Liberia identified several gaps and challenges. Some of the gaps identified include low coverage of contact tracing; persisting denial and resistance in the community; weak data management; inadequate infection prevention and control practices, especially in peripheral health facilities; and weak leadership and coordination at sub-national levels. Underpinning these challenges were limited financial resources and human technical capacity. Comprehensive mapping of the financial, logistics, and human resource needs will be articulated in the national operational plan under development. This exercise of developing prioritized operational plans is also being conducted in Guinea and Sierra Leone.  Following the call for regional collaboration during the Accra Ministerial meeting, the Government and the Ministry of Health of Gambia provided a team of 11 health-care workers to support outbreak response in Sierra Leone. While this team will contribute the critical human resource needs, the mission will be crucial for enhancing capacity for epidemic preparedness and response in The Gambia. This mission is being supported by UNDP, Gambia, and WHO Sierra Leone.  Efforts are currently ongoing to scale up and strengthen all aspects of the outbreak response in the three countries, including contact tracing, public information and community mobilization, case management and infection prevention and control, and coordination.  WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.  Disease update  New cases and deaths attributable to EVD continue to be reported by the Ministries of Health in the three West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Between 15 – 17 July 2014, 67 new cases of EVD, including 19 new deaths, were reported from the three countries as follows: Guinea, 0 new cases and 0 deaths; Liberia, 22 new cases with 10 deaths; and Sierra Leone 45 new cases and 9 deaths. These numbers include laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths of EVD.  As of 17 July 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the three countries stands at 1 048, including 632 deaths. The distribution and classification of the cases are as follows: Guinea, 410 cases (301 confirmed, 95 probable, and 14 suspected) and 310 deaths (203 confirmed, 95 probable, and 12 suspected); Liberia, 196 cases (76 confirmed, 56 probable, and 64 suspected) and 116 deaths (54 confirmed, 40 probable, and 22 suspected); and Sierra Leone, 442 cases (368 confirmed, 48 probable, and 26 suspected) and 206 deaths (165 confirmed, 35 probable, and 6 suspected).

1001133	Outbreak at a glance   On 12 November 2022, Indonesia’s Ministry of Health notified WHO of a confirmed case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from Pidie district in Aceh province. Field investigations were immediately launched by local and national public health authorities, with support from partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. On 28 November, the Ministry of Health launched an immunization campaign for children under the age of 13 years in the affected areas.   Description of the outbreak  On 12 November 2022, Indonesia’s Ministry of Health notified WHO of a confirmed case of VDPV2. The case was a 7-year-old boy from Pidie district in Aceh province, who developed AFP on 9 October 2022. The case had not received oral polio vaccine (OPV) or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and had no travel history or contact with those who had traveled. On 25 November 2022, three more genetically related isolates of cVDPV2 were reported based on the laboratory results of stool samples taken from three healthy children who were in the same community but not close contacts of the confirmed case. Sequencing results from Biofarma lab showed 25 nucleotide changes for the AFP case and 25 to 26 nucleotide changes for the three asymptomatic children. These results are evidence of transmission of the virus and meets the criteria to be classified as circulating VDPV2 (cVDPV2). In the past in Indonesia, a cVDPV type 1 outbreak was reported in Papua province in 2019.   Aceh province has very low polio vaccination coverage in the routine immunization programme; however, coverage is also low in several other provinces in Indonesia, including three provinces nearby Aceh (North Sumatera, West Sumatera and Riau). In 2021, in Aceh province, bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV3) coverage was 50.9%, and IPV 28.2%. and for Pidie district the coverage was 17.7% for OPV3 and 0.5% for IPV. There is low population immunity against all polioviruses but primarily type 2 in children born after the switch from the trivalent to bivalent OPV in April 2016.  Epidemiology of Poliomyelitis  Polio is a highly infectious disease that largely affects children under five years of age, causing permanent paralysis (approximately 1 in 200 infections) or death (2-10% of those paralyzed).  The virus is transmitted by person-to-person, mainly through the fecal-oral route or, less frequently, by a common vehicle (e.g., contaminated water or food) and multiplies in the intestine, from where it can invade the nervous system and cause paralysis.  The incubation period is usually 7–10 days but can range from 4–35 days. Up to 90% of those infected are either asymptomatic or experience mild symptoms and the disease usually goes unrecognized.  Vaccine-derived poliovirus is a well-documented strain of poliovirus mutated from the strain originally contained in OPV. OPV contains a live, weakened form of poliovirus that replicates in the intestine for a limited period, thereby developing immunity by building up antibodies. On rare occasions, when replicating in the gastrointestinal tract, OPV strains genetically change and may spread in communities that are not fully vaccinated against polio, especially in areas where there is poor hygiene, poor sanitation, or overcrowding. The lower the population immunity, the longer this virus survives and the more genetic changes it undergoes.  In very rare instances, the vaccine-derived virus can genetically change into a form that can cause paralysis as does the wild poliovirus – this is what is known as a vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV). The detection of VDPV in at least two different sources and at least two months apart, that are genetically linked, showing evidence of transmission in the community, should be classified as ‘circulating’ vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2). Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 continues to affect different areas of the world, notably in the African Region.  Public health response  The Ministry of Health has publicly announced the outbreak, and on 28 November, immunization campaigns were launched for 1.2 million children under the age of 13 years in the province of Aceh.  Risk assessment and field investigations were immediately launched and are still ongoing by the local and national public health authorities, with support from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) partners, including a more detailed assessment of the origin of the isolated viruses.  The Ministry of Health, with support from WHO, UNICEF and other partners, is undertaking strong measures to stop the transmission. Measures include enhanced surveillance- active search for AFP cases at health facilities and communities, assessment of OPV/IPV coverage through a rapid community survey in a sample of 200 households, and training on the surveillance guidelines for the use of novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2).  The WHO Director General approved the release of the nOPV2 for rapid response on 25 November 2022 and a rapid vaccination response was initiated on 28 November in Pidie district (the affected district) with approximately 95 603 children aged under 13 years to be vaccinated.  A rapid response vaccination campaign was launched in Aceh province for those aged zero to 12 years on 5 December 2022. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) with nOPV2 are proposed for those aged zero to 12 years in Aceh and zero to four years in North Sumatera, West Sumatra, and Riau in the first week of January 2023 and the first week of February 2023.  Advocacy campaigns, risk communication messaging, and social mobilization have been implemented.  WHO risk assessment  WHO assesses the risk to be high at the national level due to low polio vaccination coverage in Aceh and other provinces in Indonesia, the susceptibility of the population to poliovirus type 2 after switching from trivalent oral polio vaccine (tOVP) to bOPV in April 2016 combined with low uptake of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), sub-optimal surveillance capacity, and vaccine hesitancy among the at-risk population.  The detection of cVDPVs highlights the importance of maintaining high levels of routine vaccination coverage everywhere to minimize the risk and consequences of the circulation of any poliovirus, as well as the need to ensure quality surveillance for early detection of any poliovirus.   WHO advice  It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP cases and commence any planned expansion of environmental surveillance in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.  WHO’s International travel and health recommends that all travellers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio.  As per the advice of the Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005) on the international spread of poliovirus, countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country that have had an importation of cVDPV2 with local transmission should (i) declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency (ii) encourage residents and long-term visitors to receive a dose of IPV four weeks to 12 months prior to international travel, (iii) ensure that travellers who receive such vaccination have access to an appropriate document to record their polio vaccination status, (iv) further intensify efforts to increase IPV immunization coverage, including sharing coverage data, and (v) intensify regional cooperation and cross border coordination to enhance surveillance for prompt detection of poliovirus, and vaccinate refugees, travellers and cross border populations, according to the advice of the Advisory Group.  WHO does not recommend any travel and/or trade restrictions to Indonesia based on the information available for this current event.

1001134	Weekly update  20 November 2009 - As of 15 November 2009, worldwide more than 206 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 6770 deaths.  As many countries have stopped counting individual cases, particularly of milder illness, the case count is likely to be significantly lower than the actual number of cases that have occurred. WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of data.  Situation update:  The situation remains similar since the last update. In temperate regions* of the northern hemisphere, the early arriving winter influenza season continues to intensify across parts of North America and much of Europe. However, there are early signs of a peak in disease activity in some areas of the northern hemisphere.  In the United States, influenza transmission remains active and geographically widespread, although disease activity appears to have recently peaked in most areas except in the northeastern United States. In Canada, influenza transmission continues to intensify without a clear peak in activity; the ILI consultation rate, which has been highest among children aged 5-19, continues to significantly exceed mean rates observed over the past 12 influenza seasons.  In Europe, widespread and increasing transmission of pandemic influenza virus was observed across much of the continent but the most intense circulation of virus occurred in northern, eastern, and southeastern Europe. Transmission appears to have peaked in few countries of Western Europe including Iceland, Ireland, the UK (Northern Ireland), and Belgium after a period of sustained intense transmission. Further east, a number of countries reported sharp increases in the rates of ILI** (Serbia, Moldova, Norway, Lithuania, Georgia) or ARI (Belarus, Bulgaria, Romania, and Ukraine). A moderate or greater impact on the healthcare system was reported in parts of northern and southeastern Europe. Greater than 20% of all sentinel respiratory specimens tested positive for influenza in at least 20 countries, with ≥ 50% of samples testing positive for influenza in Spain, Portugal, Estonia, Slovenia, Slovakia, Moldova, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Belgium, Iceland, and Ireland. Over 99% of subtyped influenza A viruses in the Europe were pandemic H1N1 2009.  In Central and Western Asia, increasing diseases activity and pandemic influenza virus isolations continues to be reported in several countries. A high intensity of respiratory diseases with increasing trend was reported in Kazakhstan. Recent increases in rates of ILI or ARI have been observed in Uzbekistan and in parts of Afghanistan (particularly in the capital region and in southern and northeastern provinces). In Israel, sharp increases in rates of ILI and pandemic virus detections have been reported in recent weeks.  In East Asia, influenza transmission remains active. Intense influenza activity continues to be observed in Mongolia with a severe impact on the healthcare system; however, disease activity may have recently peaked in the past 1-2 weeks. In Japan, influenza activity remains elevated but stable nationally, and may be decreasing slightly in populated urban areas. A small number of seasonal H3N2 and H1N1 influenza viruses continue to be detected in China and South East Asia, though the proportion of seasonal viruses is declining in relation to the proportion of pandemic influenza H1N1.  In tropical zone of the Americas and Asia, the intensity of influenza transmission is variable. In the tropical areas of Central and South America, most countries continue to report declining influenza activity, with the exception of Peru and Colombia. In the Caribbean Epidemiology Centre (CAREC) countries, after a recent peak of disease activity, rates of ARI have declined over the past 3-4 weeks. With the exception of Sri Lanka, overall transmission continues to decline in most parts of tropical South and Southeast Asia. In Hong Kong SAR, rates of ILI have returned baseline after a recent wave of predominantly pandemic H1N1 influenza in September and October.  In the temperate region of the southern hemisphere, little pandemic influenza activity has been reported.  For more epidemiologic information please refer to the recent Weekly Epidemiological Report on Transmission Dynamics and Impact of Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Virus.  13 November 2009, vol. 84, 46 (pp 477–484)  WHO estimates that around 80 million doses of pandemic vaccine have been distributed and around 65 million people have been vaccinated. Campaigns are using a variety of different vaccines. Although intense monitoring of vaccine safety continues, all data compiled to date indicate that pandemic vaccines match the excellent safety profile of seasonal influenza vaccines.  Weekly update (Virological surveillance data)  *Countries in temperate regions are defined as those north of the Tropic of Cancer or south of the Tropic of Capricorn, while countries in tropical regions are defined as those between these two latitudes.  Qualitative indicators (Week 29 to Week 45: 13 July - 8 November 2009)  The qualitative indicators monitor: the global geographic spread of influenza, trends in acute respiratory diseases, the intensity of respiratory disease activity, and the impact of the pandemic on health-care services.  Human infection with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus: updated interim WHO guidance on global surveillance A description of WHO pandemic monitoring and surveillance objectives and methods can be found in the updated interim WHO guidance for the surveillance of human infection with pandemic (H1N1) virus.

1001135	19 June 2002 \nDisease Outbreak Reported  A three-person team from the Congolese Ministry of Health and WHO that is currently investigating 6 suspected cases including 5 deaths of acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome in Mbomo district, Cuvette Ouest region (see previous report), have traced 40 human contacts of the 6 suspected cases. No new cases have been reported since the last death on 6 June. The investigation has been hampered by the lack of community cooperation and increased emphasis will be placed on social mobilization activities. The epidemiological pattern of this cluster and the clinical signs of the suspected cases were consistent with the previous outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever in the area, but since no samples have been collected, there has been no laboratory confirmation. 
1001136	 4 March 2016  On 25 February 2016, the National IHR Focal Point for the Netherlands notified WHO of two laboratory-confirmed cases of Zika virus infection in the Island of Sint Maarten. Sint Maarten is an independent state within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is one of the Leeward Islands situated in the western part of the Caribbean region, east of Puerto Rico.  The cases include a resident islander and a tourist. Both patients were confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on 12 and 18 February, respectively. The two patients, who were unrelated, spent most of their incubation periods in Sint Maarten and stayed in the neighbouring island of Anguilla for less than 24 hours.  In the northern part of the island, the French overseas collectivity of Saint Martin, autochthonous transmission of Zika virus was already reported in January (see DON published on 21 January). To date, no cases have been reported in Anguilla. Although difficult to determine with certainty, it is most likely that the two patients acquired the infection in the southern (Dutch) part of the Island.  Public health response  Health authorities in Sint Maarten have implemented measures for mosquito control and disease prevention.  WHO risk assessment  The detection of autochthonous cases of Zika virus infection indicates that the virus is spreading geographically to previously unaffected areas (Sint Maarten). The notification of autochthonous transmission in a new country does not change the overall risk assessment. The risk of a global spread of Zika virus to areas where the competent vectors, the Aedes mosquitoes, are present is significant given the wide geographical distribution of these mosquitoes in various regions of the world. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.  Despite some reports of a potential association between Zika virus, microcephaly and other neurological disorders, at this stage, it is not possible to establish a causal relationship between these events. Until more is understood, Members States are advised to standardize and enhance surveillance for microcephaly and other neurological disorders, particularly in areas of known Zika virus transmission and areas at risk of such transmission.  WHO advice  The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for Zika virus infection. Prevention and control relies on reducing the breeding of mosquitoes through source reduction (removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between mosquitoes and people. This can be achieved by reducing the number of natural and artificial water-filled habitats that support mosquito larvae, reducing the adult mosquito populations around at-risk communities and by using barriers such as insect screens, closed doors and windows, long clothing and repellents. Since the Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission) are day-biting mosquitoes, it is recommended that those who sleep during the daytime, particularly young children, the sick or elderly, should rest under mosquito nets (bed nets), treated with or without insecticide to provide protection. Mosquito coils or other insecticide vaporizers may also reduce the likelihood of being bitten.  During outbreaks, space spraying of insecticides may be carried out following the technical orientation provided by WHO to kill flying mosquitoes. Suitable insecticides (recommended by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme) may also be used as larvicides to treat relatively large water containers, when this is technically indicated.  Basic precautions for protection from mosquito bites should be taken by people traveling to countries with transmission of Zika virus, especially by pregnant women. These include use of repellents, wearing light colored, long sleeved shirts and pants and ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering.  WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Sint Maarten based on the current information available. 
1001137	17 January 1997 Disease Outbreak Reported  The recent Cholera outbreak which occurred in Rumonge, in the south of the country bordering Lake Tanganyika, is continuing and up to 13 January a total of 482 cases with 21 deaths have been reported. The breakdown of water supplies after the affected village was the target of an armed group, continuing poor hygiene practices and an increase in the number of displaced persons in the area have all contributed to this outbreak.  A national cholera control committee has been established with the support of WHO and other agencies. A plan of action which puts emphasis on improved case management, surveillance and prevention of the spread of the disease has been prepared together with a request by the government to WHO for acute basic needs. 
1001138	9 December 2010 - The Ministry of Health of Indonesia has announced a new case of human infection of H5N1 avian influenza.  A 21-year-old female from Bandung City, West Java, Province developed symptoms on 14 November, was hospitalized on 22 November and is currently in hospital. Initial investigations indicate the case resided in an area close to a business where chickens were kept and the area was found to be lacking cleanliness with chicken droppings present. Additional investigations on the possible source of infections are being undertaken.  Laboratory tests have confirmed infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus.  Of the 171 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 141 have been fatal. 
1001139	 4 July 2017  On 19 June 2017, the national IHR focal point of Lebanon reported one additional case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.  Details of the case  Detailed information concerning the case reported can be found in a separate document (see link below).  MERS-CoV case reported on 19 June 2017.xlsx, 40kb  A 39-year-old male Lebanese national living in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia developed mild symptoms on 8 June 2017. As the patient was a health care worker and due to enhanced Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) surveillance activities ongoing in Riyadh, a nasopharyngeal swab was collected on 11 June 2017 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and tested negative for MERS-CoV by PCR at the Riyadh Regional Laboratory. The case is without a history of comorbid conditions. He does not work in a health care facility with active MERS patients, has not had contact with an identified confirmed MERS case, nor has had known contact with a patient with respiratory illness. He has no history of contact with dromedaries in the 14 days prior to the onset of the symptoms.  On 11 June 2017, the case travelled from Saudi Arabia to Lebanon and reported that he had no symptoms while travelling. On 15 June, he developed gastrointestinal symptoms and a medical investigation was initiated on the same day in Lebanon, whereupon a chest X-ray confirmed the diagnosis of pneumonia. A lower respiratory specimen was collected 16 June 2017 and tested positive for MERS-CoV. The case was reported to Ministry of Public Health on the same day. The case was placed in home isolation. The case has been asymptomatic since 17 June 2017, and two consecutive nasopharyngeal swabs and one lower respiratory sample were collected and tested negative for MERS-CoV by PCR, on 17, 19 and 23 June 2017, respectively. The patient was released from home isolation on 23 June 2017. All contacts in Lebanon have tested negative for MERS-CoV. Contact tracing in Saudi Arabia and the source of infection are under investigation by the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia.  Globally, 2037 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 710 related deaths have been reported to WHO.  Public health response  During the investigation of this case, the Ministry of Public Health evaluated the case and his contacts and implemented measures to limit further human-to-human transmission. These measures included:  Proper isolation for confirmed cases (home isolation for asymptomatic patients, and in hospital for symptomatic patients). Active tracing for all contacts of patients, exposed health care workers and community contacts in Lebanon. Identification and contact and follow up of contacts in Saudi Arabia and investigation into the patient’s source of infection, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia. Identification of high and low risk contacts among health care workers with daily monitoring for all during incubation period of the 14 days, and performing laboratory testing with nasopharyngeal swabs from all exposed health care workers, regardless of the development of symptoms. All tests among contacts have been negative. Identification of high and low risk contacts among households with daily monitoring for all during incubation period of the 14 days, and PCR testing for symptomatic contacts. No symptoms were observed among household contacts. Enforcement of infection prevention and control measures at the hospital. Sending positive specimens to reference labs for confirmation and sequencing.  The Ministry of Public Health in Lebanon is communicating with the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia for follow up of health care workers and social contacts of the patient while he was in Saudi Arabia. The patient had not worked in a health care facility where recent MERS cases have been reported, but had initially been tested in Riyadh on 11 June 2017 as part of enhanced surveillance activities in Riyadh due to the clusters of MERS cases previously reported in the Disease Outbreak News published on 13 June 2017, 19 June 2017, and 28 June 2017.  WHO risk assessment  MERS-CoV causes severe human infections resulting in high mortality and has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings. This is the second case of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV reported from Lebanon. One case of MERS has previously been reported in Lebanon on 8 May 2014 (See Disease Outbreak News published on 15 May 2014).  The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.  WHO advice  Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.  Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.  Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.  Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.  WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions. 
1001140	Weekly update  28 May 2010 - As of 23 May, worldwide more than 214 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 18114 deaths.  WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and Member States and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.  Situation update:  The most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission currently are in parts of the Caribbean and Southeast Asia, where low level circulation is occurring. Except for localized areas of pandemic influenza activity in parts of Chile, there is little evidence of pandemic influenza activity in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere. Of note, Respiratory Syncitial Virus (RSV) is widely circulating in South America resulting in an increase in respiratory disease activity, complicating somewhat the interpretation of syndromic surveillance data from the area. RSV primarily affects children under the age of 5 years. Seasonal influenza A viruses continue to be detected at low to sporadic levels in all regions. Influenza B has been reported in increasing but low numbers in South America, where it only recently appeared, while it is decreasing in Asia.  In the Caribbean and Central America, Cuba and to a much lesser extent Costa Rica, continue to experience active circulation of pandemic influenza virus. In Cuba, current pandemic influenza activity, which began during late February 2010, remains unchanged since reaching a plateau during mid-April 2010; in addition, over the past month, there have been sporadic detections of seasonal influenza B viruses and also evidence of co-circulation of other respiratory viruses. In Costa Rica, sustained low levels of pandemic influenza virus have been co-circulating with other respiratory viruses since the beginning of 2010. Several other countries in the region continue to report sporadic detections of seasonal influenza B viruses and low level co-circulation of other respiratory viruses.  In the tropical zone of South America, pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses continued to circulate at low to sporadic levels. In Peru, recent regional increases in respiratory diseases activity (in children under age 5) has been largely associated with circulating respiratory syncitial virus (RSV). In Colombia and Brazil, low levels of pandemic and seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses have been detected over the past month. In Bolivia, a recent period of circulation of predominantly seasonal influenza type B viruses appears to have concluded.  In Asia, overall pandemic influenza activity remains low to sporadic, except in limited areas of south and southeast Asia, particularly Singapore, Malaysia, and Bangladesh. In Singapore, levels of ARI have been elevated since April 2010 and in recent weeks have remained near epidemic threshold; approximately 39% of respiratory specimens from ILI patients tested positive for pandemic influenza virus during mid May 2010. In neighboring Malaysia, limited data suggest that active pandemic influenza virus circulation persist after recent activity peaked during mid April 2010; small numbers of fatal cases have been reported since that time. In Bangladesh, co-dominant circulation of pandemic and seasonal influenza B viruses has been observed since mid April 2010, however, the overall intensity of respiratory diseases was reported to low during this period. Low levels of pandemic influenza virus continued to circulate in western India, while low and declining levels of seasonal influenza B viruses continued to be reported across East Asia.  In Sub-Saharan Africa, limited data from several countries continues to suggest that active transmission of pandemic influenza virus in West Africa has now largely subsided. In addition to the persistence of low level circulation of pandemic influenza virus in Ghana, sporadic detections of pandemic influenza virus have been reported during the past month in Cameroon, Angola, and Rwanda. In Cameroon, there has been persistent active circulation of seasonal influenza B viruses since mid-March 2010.  In the temperate regions of the northern and southern hemisphere, overall pandemic influenza activity remains low to sporadic. In southern hemisphere, Chile continues to report increased ILI in several regions of the country (notably Los Lagos), however, the increase in respiratory disease activity has been predominantly associated with circulating RSV and only to a much lesser extent pandemic influenza virus. In neighboring Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay, all recent respiratory diseases activity during the past month has been associated with viruses other than influenza. Similarly, there have been no recent detections of influenza virus in South Africa. In New Zealand and Australia, overall levels of ILI remain low; only sporadic detections of seasonal influenza H3N2 and pandemic influenza viruses have been recently reported in Australia.  The Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic, seasonal and other influenza viruses infecting, or with the potential to infect, humans including seasonal influenza. For more information on virological surveillance and antiviral resistance please see the weekly virology update (Virological surveillance data, below).  Weekly update (Virological surveillance data) As of May 12 May 2010, 4 additional cases of oseltamivir resistant pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 viruses have been reported.

1001141	5 March 2012 - The Ministry of Health has reported a confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus.  The case is a 22 year-old male from Thanh Hoa province who lived and worked in Binh Duong province. He developed symptoms on 17 February 2012 and first sought medical care on 21 February 2012. He was admitted to the intensive care unit of the Hospital for Tropical Diseases on 23 February 2012 and received Oseltamivir upon admission. He is currently still in hospital.  Confirmatory test results for influenza A (H5N1) were obtained on 25 February 2012 by the Pasteur Institute Ho Chi Minh City, a WHO National influenza Centre.  Epidemiological investigation indicates that the man was involved in the slaughter and consumption of ducks. Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City and the local health sector are conducting the investigation and response. Close contacts of the case with fever have received prophylaxis and are being monitored; all have been confirmed as negative for H5N1 by PCR.  To date, of the 122 confirmed cases in Viet Nam, 61 have been fatal. 
1001142	16 March 2010 - The Ministry of Health has reported a new confirmed case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. This case was confirmed at the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE).  The case is a 25 year old woman residing in Soc Son District, Hanoi. She developed symptoms on 5 March 2010 and was hospitalized on 7 March 2010 at North Thang Long Hospital. On 10 March 2010, her condition had worsened so she was transferred to Bach Mai Hospital where she is being provided with ventilation.  An epidemiological investigation showed that the patient had exposure to sick and dead poultry.  Of the 116 cases confirmed to date in Viet Nam, 58 have been fatal. 
1001143	26 December 2008 - As of 25 December 2008, a total of 26 497 cases, including 1 518 deaths, have been reported by the Ministry of Health in Zimbabwe. Cases are now being reported from all 10 of the country's provinces. Harare, particularly Budiriro suburb in the south west, accounts for the majority of cases, followed by Beitbridge in Matabeleland South and Mudzi in Mashonaland East. The current outbreak is the largest ever recorded in Zimbabwe and is not yet under control. In fact, the epidemiological week ending 20 December saw over 5 000 new cases - an increase in the number of weekly cases relative to previous weeks - and an increase in deaths outside treatment/health centres.  The overall Case Fatality Rate (CFR) has risen to 5.7% - far above the 1% which is normal in large outbreaks - and in some rural areas it has reached as high as 50%. Mortality outside of healthcare facilities remains very high. This is a clear indication that better case management and access to healthcare is needed - in particular an increased use of oral rehydration therapy with Oral Rehydration Salts in communities very early after onset of the disease.  The outbreak has taken on a subregional dimension with cases being reported from neighboring countries. In South Africa as of 26 December, 1 279 cumulative cases and 12 deaths (CFR of 0.9%) had been recorded, with the bulk of the cases (1 194) in the Limpopo area. Cases have also been reported in Botswana (Palm Tree).  The current situation is closely linked to the lack of safe drinking water, poor sanitation, declining health infrastructure, and reduced numbers of healthcare staff reporting to work. Other current risk factors include the commencement of the rainy season and the movement of people within the country, and possibly across borders, during the Christmas season. WHO, together with the Ministry of Health and partners from the health and Water and Sanitation clusters, has established a cholera outbreak response coordination unit in order to strengthen the reporting and early detection of cases, improve the response mechanism and access to healthcare and ensure proper case management. WHO has also deployed experts in public health, water and sanitation, logistics and social mobilization. In light of the extent and pace of expansion of the outbreak, reinforcing all control activities across the country is critical.  Given the current dynamic of the outbreak and the context of the collapsed health system, a cholera vaccination is not recommended. Moreover, the use of the internationally available WHO prequalified oral cholera vaccine is not recommended once an outbreak has started due to its 2-dose regimen and the time required to reach protective efficacy, high cost and the heavy logistics associated to its use. The use of the parenteral cholera vaccine has never been recommended by WHO due to its low protective efficacy and the occurrence of severe adverse events.  In controlling the spread of cholera WHO does not recommend any special restrictions to travel or trade to or from affected areas. However, neighboring countries are encouraged to reinforce their active surveillance and preparedness systems. Mass chemoprophylaxis is strongly discouraged, as it has no effect on the spread of cholera, can have adverse effects by increasing antimicrobial resistance and provides a false sense of security. 
1001144	21 December 2009 - The Ministry of Health of Egypt has reported a new laboratory confirmed human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) on 19 December 2009.  The case is a 21 year old female from the El Tanta District of Gharbia Governorate. She developed symptoms of fever and cough on 15 December 2009.  She was admitted to Tanta Fever Hospital where she received oseltamivir treatment on the same day. She is in a stable condition. Investigation revealed that the case had close contact with dead poultry and was involved in slaughtering sick birds.  The case was confirmed by the Egyptian Central Public Health Laboratories, a National Influenza Center of the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN).  Of the 90 laboratory confirmed cases of Avian influenza A(H5N1) reported in Egypt, 27 have been fatal.

WHO advice  Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.  Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.  Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.  Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.  WHO remains vigilant and is monitoring the situation. Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. Raising awareness about MERS-CoV among travellers to and from affected countries is good public health practice.  Public health authorities in host countries preparing for mass gatherings should ensure that all recommendations and guidance issued by WHO with respect to MERS-CoV have been appropriately taken into consideration and made accessible to all concerned officials. Public health authorities should plan for surge capacity to ensure that visitors during the mass gathering can be accommodated by health systems.

1001148	8 December 2010 - The Ministry of Health of Egypt has announced a new case of human infection of H5N1 avian influenza. A 30-year-old female from Gharbia Governorate, developed symptoms on 28 November, was hospitalized on 1st of December, where she received oseltamivir treatment, and died on 2nd of December.  Investigations into the source of infection indicated that the case had exposure to sick and dead poultry.  The case was confirmed by the Egyptian Central Public Health Laboratories, a National Influenza Center of the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN).  Of the 113 cases confirmed to date in Egypt, 37 have been fatal. 
1001149	06 December 1996 Disease Outbreak Reported  The UNHCR has reported on action taken as a result of the laboratory confirmation of cholera on 23 November in a refugee from a Kigoma holding centre. Cholera has since been confirmed in all three holding centres in Kigoma town. As at 4 December, 1 100 cases of presumed cholera had been detected (note: the case definition of presumed cholera is only "watery diarrhoea") in the refugee population; six were fatal - three among children under 10 years of age and three in patients over 60 years of age. Six percent of the 1 100 presumed cases required IV rehydration. The population in the holding centres is estimated at 25 000. The number fluctuates as refugees continue to arrive from Zaire and others are transferred from the holding centres to the camps. Based on a total refugee population at risk the 1 100 cases detected correspond to a daily incidence of watery diarrhoea of 5-8 per 1 000. Incidence of bloody diarrhoea is 2 to 3 per thousand per day.  Action taken: Improving water, sanitation and living conditions in all three Kigoma holding centres was the first priority. Latrines have been built, water is now available almost continuously and trucks are transporting people out of the holding centres to the camps at a rate of 1 000 persons per day, weather permitting. Daily surveillance of diarrhoeal disease in all camps and holding centres by IRC, MSF and UNHCR is coupled with active case-finding in the holding centres by community health workers. MSF has set up an emergency treatment area in one of the holding centres for oral and IV rehydration and strict hygienic control of the cholera patients. Nyarugusu Camp, which is receiving most of the refugees transferred out of the holding centres, is also ready to treat patients with cholera. Ujiji Hospital, which has a special diarrhoea ward, is being upgraded by MSF logistics. Wards are being rebuilt, electricity is brought in, extra latrines are under construction. Forty extra beds, in addition to the existing 10, will be made available this week. Vibrio cholerae cultures obtained from both refugees and locals have been sent to the Tanzanian Reference Laboratory for confirmation, grouping and sensitivity testing. Supplies have also been ordered to allow the local laboratory technician to work on identification and sensitivity testing of cholera strains, as well as shigella strains, should a shigella outbreak occurs.  (Source: A report by UNHCR Health Coordinator in Kigoma. GLR Health Information Network, No. 6)  A WHO epidemiologist from the Global Cholera Task Force is joining the international team in Kigoma today. 
1001150	6 May 2009 - On 15 April 2009, The Ministry of Health (MoH), Liberia reported one laboratory-confirmed case of yellow fever in Luyeama town, Zorzor District. The case was identified through regular yellow fever surveillance in Lofa County.  The index case was a 32 year-old man who presented with fever and jaundice which began on 28 February 2009. On 28 March, the patient went to the Tellewoyan Hospital in Voinjama City, Lofa County where the clinical diagnosis of yellow fever was made.  The case was laboratory-confirmed by the Pasteur Institute in Dakar, Senegal. During the outbreak investigation, 9 serum samples of suspected cases and “contacts” were collected. No additional yellow fever cases have been identified.  The MoH has planned to vaccinate the districts of Zorzor and Voinjama, with a target population of 96,169. The country has requested yellow fever vaccines from the GAVI funded Global Emergency Stockpile for Yellow Fever Vaccine, managed by the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision for Yellow Fever Control (YF-ICG). 
1001151	12 June 2007  The Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population has confirmed a new human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection.

1001153	18 November 1999 Disease Outbreak Reported  Following a trade fair in Kapellen, Belgium, an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease has been reported. So far, out of 80 persons who developed clinical symptoms, 13 had positive urinary tests including 4 who died.  Over 60.000 visitors attended the fair, and initial investigation suggests that whirlpool baths exhibited at the show are the most likely origin of the infection. The trade fair took place between 29 October and 7 November, 1999. The investigation by the health authorities is in progress. 
1001154	24 January 2008  The Ministry of Health of Indonesia has announced the death of a previously confirmed case of H5N1 infection. The 30-year-old male from Tangerang District, Banten Province died on 24 January 2008.  Of the 120 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 98 have been fatal. 
1001155	20 September 2002 Disease Outbreak Reported  As of 19 September 2002, Health Canada has reported a total number of 20 human cases of West Nile virus infection: 17 suspected cases, 3 confirmed cases, including 1 death. Three suspected cases are resident in the province of Quebec, while the other 14 suspected cases and 3 confirmed cases are resident in the province of Ontario (see previous report). Two of the confirmed cases are likely to have acquired their infection within Ontario, whereas one is likely to have acquired the infection while travelling in the United States. For more information about this outbreak see the Health Canada web site: West Nile virus surveillance information  
1001156	12 July 2001 Disease Outbreak Reported  As of 11 July, the National Centre for Epidemiology, Spain, has reported a total of 470 cases of suspected legionellosis in Murcia. One-hundred-seventy-eight of these cases have been laboratory confirmed, and the first case was hospitalized on 1 July. One patient, a 65-year-old male, has died. No cases have been reported among tourists.  The majority of cases are residents in the northern neighborhoods of the city. It is suspected that local cooling towers, several of which are present in these neighborhoods, are the most likely source of infection, however other possible sources are being investigated.  A detailed investigation by the health authorities and environmental sampling are presently being conducted.  Legionellosis is a bacterial disease. Humans are infected by inhaling small droplets or particles contaminated with Legionella bacteria. Control measures focus on eliminating the source of the infectious particles. The infection is not transmitted from person-to-person.  For additional information about legionellosis, please see the following web sites at our partner institutions:  http://www.phls.co.uk/International/Ewgli/ewgli2.htm  http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/legionellosis_g.htm 
1001157	 23 June 2014  On 18 June 2014, the National IHR Focal Point for Brazil reported the isolation of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) from sewage samples collected in March 2014 at Viracopos International Airport, in Campinas municipality in the State of São Paulo, Brazil. Virus has been detected in the sewage only; sewage samples collected from the same site subsequent to the detection of WPV1 have been either negative or only positive for Sabin strains or non-polio enteroviruses; to date no case of paralytic polio has been reported. The isolate was detected through routine environmental surveillance testing of sewage water; there is no evidence of transmission of WPV1.  Genetic sequencing indicated a close match with a strain of WPV1 that was recently isolated from a case of polio in Equatorial Guinea. Additional epidemiological investigation is ongoing.  The Americas Region has been free of indigenous WPV transmission since 1991 and Brazil since 1989. There is no indigenous transmission of wild poliovirus reported in Brazil since 1989.  Brazil health authorities have enhanced their surveillance activity aimed to detect transmission of WPV1 and potential cases of paralytic polio as well as for any un-immunized persons. The vaccination coverage against polio in São Paulo State and Campinas municipality have been higher than 95% in the routine immunization program. The last national OPV campaign was conducted in June 2013. The campaign for this year is planned in November 2014 at the national level and the target group is children 6 months to less than 5 years of age with OPV.  Specimens collected through environmental surveillance at this and other sites in Brazil since 1994 have consistently tested negative for the presence of WPV.  Given the high levels of population immunity indicated by the high routine immunization coverage and implementation of periodic vaccination campaigns in the area — no evidence so far of WPV1 transmission and the response being implemented — the World Health Organization (WHO) assesses the risk of further international spread of this virus from Brazil as very low.  Given the ongoing WPV1 outbreak in Equatorial Guinea, low national routine immunization coverage, and the inconsistent quality of the initial outbreak response vaccination campaigns, WHO assesses the risk of additional exportation from Equatorial Guinea as high.  WHO note  Brazil was not re-infected with WPV; the country was exposed to a poliovirus importation.  The environmental surveillance system had the capacity to detect the poliovirus in sewage samples and the high immunity appears to have prevented transmission.  WHO travel recommendations  WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Brazil has detected a poliovirus importation event. Based on current evidence, the country is not considered polio-affected. 
1001158	02 November 2000 Disease Outbreak Reported  As of 2 November, the Ugandan Ministry of Health has reported cumulative figures of 262 cases including 81 deaths.  The first virologically confirmed case outside Gulu district has been reported in Mbarara district in southwestern Uganda. The sample was tested by the laboratory established in Gulu by the WHO Collaborating Centre at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), United States. The Ugandan Ministry of Health has requested specialists in the management of Ebola in Gulu to carry out an investigation. A WHO-led team from Gulu including CDC and Médecins sans Frontières in Kampala are travelling to Mbarara district to investigate the report.

He was admitted to hospital on 13 January, transferred to another hospital on 18 January, and is in a critical condition. The patient has a history of exposure to poultry.  The source of infection is still under investigation. So far, there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission.  The Chinese government continues to take the following measures:  strengthen surveillance and situation analysis; reinforce case management and treatment; conduct risk communication with the public and release information; strengthen international collaboration and communication; and conduct scientific studies.  WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. 
1001160	23 December 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported  Summary  (Week 50, 7 December - 13 December 2003)  Influenza activity associated with influenza A(H3N2) viruses continues to increase in Africa (Tunisia), Europe (Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Norway, Russia, Switzerland, Russia Federation and Ukraine) and North America (the United States), and persists in France and some parts of Canada. In other European countries (Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom) and most parts of Canada, activity has declined.  Most influenza infections this season have been attributed to influenza A(H3N2) viruses. The majority of viruses antigenically characterized so far have been shown to be A/Fujian/411/2002-like; the rest have been A/Panama/2007/99-like. There have been few reports of influenza A/Fujian/411/2002-like virus detections from Asia. Influenza A(H1) and B viruses have also been detected in some countries. Both B/Hong Kong/330/2001-like and B/Sichuan/379/99-like viruses have been identified. The hemagglutinins of all influenza A(H1) viruses characterized so far have been A/New Caledonia/20/99-like.  An avian influenza A(H5N1) outbreak in poultry in a chicken farm in the Republic of Korea was reported on Tuesday 16 December. The outbreak was recognized by the death of about 19 000 chickens. Surviving chickens in the affected farm were slaughtered. As of Monday 22 December 2003, nine poultry farms in 4 provinces were found to be infected by avian influenza. About one million chickens and ducks are to be culled. The A(H5N1) strain isolated is being examined to determine its relation to other influenza A(H5N1) viruses, which emerged in Asia recently. So far no human A(H5N1) cases have been reported.  Additional investigation of a recent influenza A(H9N2) case in Hong Kong SAR China is on going to determine the source of infection. Virus isolates have been sent to the WHO Collaborating Centers for Reference and Research on Influenza for sequencing and antigenic makeup characterising to update the diagnostic reagents available for National Influenza Centers. So far all further results of investigation appear to confirm the initial findings that this is an isolated case.  For previous update For more information:WHO Influenza web site  Canada.

1001161	29 April 1999 Disease Outbreak Reported  A joint investigation by WHO, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) identified relapsing fever as the cause of fever of unknown origin in Rumbek county, southern Sudan.  Six patients from 3 different locations were tested positive for Borrelia sp. by microscopy in the field. While the number of cases of relapsing fever was found to be declining, the disease is still occurring in small clusters throughout the county. Disease activity may continue in the area leading to further large outbreaks if there are gatherings of large numbers of people with poor hygiene facilities.  The investigation team and the local authority have launched a control programme including: training of local health workers in diagnosis, treatment and delousing techniques; strengthening the surveillance system; co-ordinating epidemic response; and securing adequate supplies of erythromycin and permethrin delousing powder. An action plan for improved epidemic preparedness, detection and response has been proposed. 
1001162	11 April 2011 - The Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Kingdom of Cambodia has announced a confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus.  The case was an 11 year old girl from Steung Trang district, Kampong Cham Province. She developed symptoms on 22 March, was initially treated by local villagers with no effect and was admitted to a local hospital on 29 March. Further treatment at the local hospital was ineffective and she was referred to a regional hospital where she died within four hours of admission on 31 March.  There have been reports of poultry die off in her village. The girl is the fourteenth person in Cambodia to become infected with the H5N1 virus and the twelfth to die from complications of the disease. All four cases of H5N1 infections in humans in Cambodia this year have been fatal.  All contacts of the case have been tested and are negative for A/H5N1 influenza virus. 
1001163	31 October 2001 Disease Outbreak Reported  Through the WHO Collaborating Centres, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), WHO is continuing to monitor the situation in the United States. For the latest information from CDC, click here. 
1001164	15 October 2002 Disease Outbreak Reported  As of 11 October 2002, Health Canada has reported a total number of 69 human cases of West Nile virus infection: 49 suspected cases, 20 confirmed cases, including 1 death. One suspected case and 3 confirmed cases are resident in the province of Quebec, while the other 48 suspected cases and 17 confirmed cases are resident in the province of Ontario (see previous report). One confirmed case likely acquired infection while travelling in the United States whereas all other cases acquired their infection within their home province. For more information about this outbreak see the Health Canada web site: West Nile virus surveillance information 
1001165	 13 November 2015  On 12 November 2015, the National IHR Focal Point of Suriname notified PAHO/WHO of 4 additional cases of Zika virus infection. The cases were laboratory confirmed by the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA). Furthermore, one of two previously reported cases (see DON published on 11 November) was also re-confirmed by CARPHA.  WHO advice  Given the increased transmission of Zika virus in the Region of the Americas, PAHO/WHO recommends that its Member States establish and maintain the capacity to detect and confirm cases of Zika virus infection, prepare their health services for a potential additional burden at all levels of health care, and implement an effective public communications strategy to reduce the mosquitoes that transmit this disease, particularly in areas where this vector is present. The complete set of recommendations is available in the latest Epidemiological Update (see related links). 
1001166	Disease outbreak news  17 April 2014 - In Equatorial Guinea, three new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been reported on 14 April 2014, the first polio in the country since 1999. Genetic sequencing indicates these cases are linked to an ongoing WPV1 outbreak in Cameroon which has subsequently been detected in Equatorial Guinea. The cases had onset of paralysis on 28 January 2014, 19 January 2014 and 24 March 2014, from Centro Sur, Bioko Norte and Litoral. Outbreak response in Equatorial Guinea is currently being planned, including National Immunization Days (NIDs) with bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) on 21-24 April 2014. An estimated 40% of children are fully immunized against polio in the country.  On 17 March 2014, WHO had elevated the risk assessment of international spread of polio from Cameroon to ‘very high’ (see previous polio outbreak news under 'related links'). The risk assessment was elevated due to: confirmation of three additional WPV1 cases (with onset of paralysis on 6, 25 and 31 January 2014) from three new regions of Cameroon, confirming continued WPV transmission and geographic expansion of infected areas following detection of four cases in October 2013; gaps in surveillance; and, influx of vulnerable refugee populations from Central African Republic.  The confirmation of new cases in Cameroon resulted in planning additional emergency outbreak response activities, including converting a subnational immunization campaign to a full nationwide activity on 11-13 April 2014, and implementing nationwide campaigns in May and June 2014. Critical to success will be to ensure substantial improvement in the quality of immunization campaigns that reach all children multiple times with OPV. Equally important will be efforts to rapidly improve the quality of surveillance so that the full extent of the outbreak can be determined and tracked.  Immunity levels and surveillance sensitivity are also being assessed in neighbouring countries, in particular in Gabon and the Republic of Congo. In Gabon, a nationwide immunization campaign is planned for 22-26 April 2014 (targeting all children aged less than 15 years), and in the Republic of Congo, a nationwide activity will be conducted on 1 May 2014.  It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importations and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.  WHO’s International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. 
1001167	30 July 1997 Disease Outbreak Reported  An outbreak has occurred in Kouango Sous-Préfecture (Ouaka Prefecture) in the Central African Republic where 44 cases with 8 deaths have been reported from 8 to 17 July. Cholera has not been reported previously in this country and the health authorities are taking appropriate measures to control the outbreak in collaboration with the WHO representative and in accordance with WHO guidelines. 
1001168	18 September 2012 - As of 16 September 2012, a cumulative total of 18,508 cases including 271 deaths (with a case fatality ratio of 1.5%) has been reported in the ongoing cholera outbreak in Sierra Leone since the beginning of the year.  The highest numbers of cases are reported from the Western area of the country where the capital city of Freetown is located.  The Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS) is closely working with partners at national and international levels to step up response to the cholera outbreak. The ongoing activities at the field level include case management; communication and social mobilization; water, sanitation and hygiene promotion; surveillance and data management.  Emphasis is being placed on early detection of cases and timely provision of treatment at the district levels in order to reduce deaths. Cholera cases are managed in cholera treatment units (CTUs) and where there are no established CTUs, emphasis is placed on designating specific areas within the health facilities for isolation purposes.  At the national level, the Cholera command and Control Centre (C4) continues to provide technical advice, coordinate and monitor the outbreak. The C4 was established to implement activities related to the Cholera Preparedness and Response Operation Plan (CPROP) in order to bring the epidemic under control as soon as possible. The C4 will also provide information to guide the decision-making of the national task force.  WHO and partners are supporting the government in the response to the outbreak. Through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), experienced case management and laboratory experts from the International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR, B) are deployed to build capacity among health-care workers and laboratory technicians in case management and laboratory diagnosis.  With respect to this event, WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Sierra Leone. 
1001169	On 6 August 2021, the Ministry of Health of Guinea informed WHO of a confirmed case of Marburg virus disease (MVD) in Guéckédou Prefecture, Nzérékoré Region, south-western Guinea. The village where the case resided is near both Sierra Leone and Liberian borders. This is the first known case of Marburg virus disease in Guinea and in West Africa.  The case, a male, had onset of symptoms on 25 July. On 1 August he attended a small health facility near his village of residence with symptoms of fever, headache, fatigue, abdominal pain, and gingival hemorrhage. A rapid diagnostic test for malaria was performed which was negative. The patient received supportive care with rehydration, parenteral antibiotics and treatment to manage symptoms.  On 2 August 2021, he died in the community and an alert was raised by the sub-prefecture public health care facility to the prefectorial department of health in Guéckédou. Following the alert, an investigation team comprosed of national authorities and WHO experts was deployed to conduct an in-depth investigation. The team collected a post-mortem oral swab sample, which was sent the same day to the viral haemorrhagic fever reference laboratory in Guéckédou.On 3 August a real-time PCR was conducted which confirmed the sample was positive for Marburg virus disease and negative for Ebola virus disease. On 5 August the National Reference Laboratory in Conakry provided confirmation by real-time PCR of the positive Marburg result and on 9 August Institut Pasteur Dakar in Senegal provided reconfirmation that the result was positive for Marburg virus disease and negative for Ebola virus disease.  Public health response  The Ministry of Health (MoH) together with WHO, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ALIMA, Red Cross, UNICEF, The International Organization for Migration and other partners, have initiated measures to control the outbreak and prevent further spread. Contact tracing is ongoing, along with active case searching in health facilities and at the community level. Three family members and a healthcare worker were identified as high-risk close contacts and their health is being monitored.  The most recent Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Guinea was declared over on 19 June 2021 and a network of community health workers was set up as part of this recent outbreak along with a WHO technical team which has remained in country to support the government’s implementation of a post-EVD plan to enhance disease surveillance. This team has now been repurposed to support the government’s response activities to this outbreak of Marburg.  The MoH has activated the national and district emergency management committees to coordinate the response including:  A public health emergency operations center has been activated and a base to support response workers will be set up in the sub-prefecture of Koundou. An in-depth epidemiological investigation is being conducted around the confirmed case to identify the source of the outbreak: to date, a total of 146 contacts were identified and as of 8 August, 145 contacts have been followed-up. Active searching for suspected cases in the community and health facilities is ongoing. A surveillance team has been deployed and briefings for health workers are underway, with particular focus on the village where the index case was identified along with villages within a 15 kilometer radius. Point of entry surveillance is being reinforced and two health control entry points were recently revitalized (Kiesseneye and Nongoa). The three main entry points with Sierra Leone and Liberia are active and the others are under evaluation. In collaboration with ALIMA, there is an ongoing assessment of the case management capacity in the health facilities. Risk communication activities are ongoing in the community. Infection prevention and control activities (IPC) are ongoing and briefing sessions are being conducted on IPC and water and sanitation hygiene (WASH) standards in Koundou health center, along with information sessions for the population of Temessadou Mboket village volunteers on safe and dignified burials      WHO risk assessment  Marburg virus disease (MVD) is a highly virulent, epidemic-prone disease associated with high case fatality rates (CFR 24-90%). In the early course of the disease, clinical diagnosis of MVD is difficult to distinguish from other tropical febrile illnesses, because of the similarities in the clinical symptoms. Differential diagnoses to be excluded include, Ebola virus disease, as well as malaria, typhoid fever, leptospirosis, rickettsial infection, and plague. MVD is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, bodily fluids and/or tissues of infected persons or wild animals (e.g. monkeys and fruit bats).   Currently, there is no specific therapeutic or drug approved for MVD. Nevertheless, supportive care including: close monitoring of vital signs, fluid resuscitation, electrolyte and acid base monitoring along with management of co-infections and organ dysfunction, are critical components of care and optimize patient outcomes and survival. Some monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) are under development and other antivirals are being explored for MVD (e.g. Galidesvir, Favipiravir, Remdesivir) as part of clinical trials, but without clear results in the current moment more evidence and further studies are required. However, these should only be used as part of a randomized controlled trial.   As of 7 August, only one case has been confirmed and all four identified high-risk close contacts are asymptomatic. Investigations are ongoing to identify the source of the infection and additional contacts of the index case.   Guinea has previous experience in managing recurring viral hemorrhagic diseases such as EVD and Lassa fever, but this is the first time that MVD has been reported. The country has a fragile healthcare system which is further exacerbated by multiple disease outbreaks, recurrent epidemics and the COVID-19 pandemic. The response activities to recent outbreaks such as EVD, COVID-19 and Lassa fever likely contributed to early detection and response to Marburg Virus Disease in Guinea.  Guinea’s health authorities have responded rapidly to this event, and measures are being quickly implemented to control the outbreak. The affected village is in a remote forested area located near the border with Sierra Leone and Liberia. Cross-border population movement and community mixing between Guinea and neighboring Sierra Leone and Liberia may increase the risk of cross-border spread and as such, the Ministry of Health and Sanitation has proactively assessed the situation together with stakeholders and the district health leadership in Kono and Kailahun districts of Sierra Leone have been alerted. Health authorities in Sierra Leone and Liberia have activated contingency plans and have started public health measures at the points of entry with Guinea. Additionally the potential transmission of the virus between bat colonies and humans also pose an increased risk for cross-border spread.   These factors suggest a high risk at the national level, requiring an immediate and coordinated response with support from international partners. The risk at the regional level is high, based on the fact that the Guéckédou prefecture is well connected to Liberia and Sierra Leone, although authorities are already taking action. The risk associated with the event at the global level is low.   WHO advice  Human-to-human transmission of Marburg virus is primarily associated with direct contact with blood and/or bodily fluids of infected persons. Transmission associated with the provision of healthcare has been reported when appropriate infection control measures are not in place.  Health workers should always implement standard precautions when caring for any patient, regardless of their presumed diagnosis. These include hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette, use of risk based personal protective equipment (PPE), safe injection practices, environmental cleaning and disinfection, appropriate linen and waste management, and decontamination of reusable medical equipment.  Other key IPC measures to prevent healthcare associated infections include early recognition (screening, triage) along with isolation and monitoring of suspected cases, investigation of health workers exposed to Marburg cases, in-patient surveillance for Marburg cases, and safe and dignified burial practices in community settings.  Health workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Marburg virus should apply additional precautionary infection control measures to prevent contact with the patient’s body fluids and/or contaminated surfaces. This includes the following PPE items: face protection (a face shield or a medical mask and goggles), a clean, non-sterile long-sleeved gown, and gloves. This further emphasizes the importance of readily available PPE at health care facilities, appropriate donning/doffing areas, IPC/WASH supplies and training on their proper uses.  Laboratory workers are also at risk. Samples taken from humans and animals for investigation of Marburg infection should be handled by trained staff and processed in suitably equipped laboratories.  Surveillance activities, including contact tracing and active case searching, must be strengthened within all affected health zones. Thus, it is recommended that neighboring countries heighten their surveillance for Viral Hemorrhagic Fever (VHF) in border communities and health facilities as well as strengthening community engagement on alert reporting and preventive measures.  Risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) is key to successfully controlling outbreaks. Raising awareness of the risk factors for Marburg infection and the protective measures individuals can take to reduce human exposure to the virus are important to reducing infections and deaths. Key public health communication messages to be provided to the affected communities include the following:  How to reduce the risk of transmission in the community arising from direct or close contact with infected patients, particularly with their bodily fluids. Close physical contact with Marburg patients should be avoided. Any suspected case, ill at home should not be managed at home, but instead immediately transferred to a health facility for treatment and isolation; during this transfer appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn. Regular hand hygiene should be performed after visiting anyone who is sick. Leaders and health workers in communities affected by Marburg, should make efforts to ensure that the population is well informed. This refers to informing the community of both the nature of the disease, to avoid further transmission, community stigmatization and encourage early presentation to treatment centers and other necessary outbreak containment measures, including safe burial of the dead. People who have died from Marburg should be promptly and safely buried.  To reduce the risk of wildlife-to-human transmission, such as through contact with fruit bats, monkeys, and apes, the following advice should be communicated:  Handle wildlife in conjunction with regular hand hygiene and where possible with gloves and other appropriate protective clothing. Cook animal products (blood and meat) thoroughly before consumption and avoid consumption of raw meat. During work or research activities or tourist visits in mines or caves inhabited by fruit bat colonies, people should wear masks and gloves.  Based on the current risk assessment and prior evidence on Ebola outbreaks, WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to and from Guinea.

1001173	7 March 2003Disease Outbreak Reported  As of 6 March, the Ministry of Health of Burkina Faso has reported a total of 3 691 cases, including 542 deaths in the country since the outbreak began in January 2003 (see previous report). Of the 53 districts in Burkina Faso, 5 districts have reached the epidemic threshold: Batie, Bogande, Manga, Po and Zabre and 8 districts are in the alert phase: Boulsa, Bousse, Dande, Leo, Nanoro, Sapone, Secteur 30 de Ouagadougou, and Zorgho.  A mass vaccination campaign in Manga and Bogande is continuing. A team from the Ministry of Health and WHO have carried out an assessment mission to those districts having reached the epidemic threshold and have developed action plans to contain the outbreaks in these areas. Laboratory tests from samples in these districts confirm Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A and W135. 
1001174	 11 March 2015  Between 26 February and 2 March 2015, the National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia notified WHO of 18 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including 5 deaths.

Currently, he is in stable condition in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward. A 91-year-old female from Riyadh city developed symptoms on 24 February while admitted to hospital since 12 February due to unrelated medical conditions. The patient had other comorbidities. She was admitted to the same hospital as other laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases; however, the patient has no epidemiological links with the cases. She had no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. The patient passed away on 2 March. A 40-year-old female from Aljouf city developed symptoms on 21 February and was admitted to hospital on the same day. The patient had comorbidities. On 17 February, she received care for an unrelated medical condition in a hospital that treated other laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases; however, the patient had no contact with these cases. She had no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. The patient passed away on 28 February. A 51-year-old, non-national male from Khober city developed symptoms on 17 February and was admitted to hospital on 24 February. The patient has comorbidities. He is a household contact of a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case that was reported in a previous DON on 23 February (case n. 9). Currently, the patient is in stable condition in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward.  The National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia also notified WHO of the death of 6 previously reported MERS-CoV cases. The cases were reported in previous DONs on 23 February (cases n. 2, 35), on 26 February (case n. 3) and on 6 March (cases n. 2, 4, 8).  Contact tracing of household contacts and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases.  Globally, WHO has been notified of 1059 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 394 related deaths.  WHO advice  Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.  Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.  Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.  Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.  WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions. 
1001175	 4 August 2017  On 6 May 2017, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of Côte d’Ivoire notified World Health Organization (WHO) of a dengue fever outbreak in Abidjan, the capital city of Côte d’Ivoire.  Suspected cases of dengue were first reported on 22 April 2017 and confirmed by the Institut Pasteur de Côte d’Ivoire (IPCI) laboratory on 28 April 2017. As of 11 July 2017, a total of 623 suspected cases including two deaths (case fatality rate: 0.3%) have been reported. A total of 192 cases have been confirmed by PCR, of which 66% were dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2), 29% were DENV-3 and 5% were DENV-1. In addition, 90 samples were confirmed IgM positive by serology.  The majority of cases have been reported from Abidjan city. Cocody Bingerville health district accounted for 78% of cases and 80% of all confirmed cases. The general trend of suspected cases of dengue fever is increasing. From 27 June to 4 July 2017, 37 new cases were reported and from 4 to 11 July 2017, 142 new suspected cases were reported. Twenty-seven per cent of the suspected cases are aged between 15 and 29 years old, 55% are 30 years old and above. Fifty four percent of the cases are female. Coinfection with yellow fever was suspected in 68 cases and confirmed in one case. Further laboratory confirmation is ongoing.  The main predisposing factors for the outbreak are the high density of mosquito breeding sites, insufficient awareness on mosquito breeding and biting in the community and the ongoing rainy season.  Public health response  The MoH through the Institut National d’Hygiène Publique (INHP) is coordinating the response to the outbreak.  Vector control interventions including elimination of mosquito breeding sites by source reduction measures (destroying, altering, removing or recycling non-essential containers that provide larval habitats) and fumigation for the elimination of adult mosquitoes are ongoing. Over 17 000 households were inspected and over 250 000 mosquito breeding sites were eliminated and/or treated.  Surveillance is being improved with active case finding, sample collection for laboratory confirmation, and dissemination of the case definition. The private health sector is contributing to disease surveillance and management.  In addition, community engagement strengthening is another pillar of the ongoing response. Political, religious and community leaders are being sensitized on the prevention and control of dengue virus. The MoH has engaged the town mayors in the outbreak control measures.  WHO risk assessment  The overall risk observed at the national level is moderate. The weather conditions and coastal location including urban and semi-urban settings, as well as the high entomological indices observed during the initial investigation, are risk factors for dengue fever outbreak in the country. The low case fatality rate shows adequate case management at this time. Strengthening education of health care workers, vector control, laboratory and surveillance interventions are important to contain this outbreak. The risk at regional level is moderate while the risk at global level is low.  WHO advice  The current dengue fever outbreak in Côte d’Ivoire is taking place within the broader context of emergence of the disease in West Africa. The geographical distribution of dengue fever is increasing and cases are being reported in areas where the disease has not previously been reported. Case reporting should be strengthened to ensure continued surveillance of the outbreak in Côte d’Ivoire. Surveillance of vectors in the country is also important. WHO recommends strengthening laboratory diagnosis during this outbreak.  WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to Côte d’Ivoire on the basis of the information available on the current dengue fever outbreak. 
1001176	17 June 2005  The Ministry of Health in Viet Nam has today confirmed that between 1 to 17 June, 4 cases of human infection with H5N1 avian influenza were reported. Two of the patients are from Hanoi and one is from the nearby province of Hai Duong. The fourth patient is from the central province of Nghe An.  All 4 of the patients are alive. At present, a total of 7 patients are being treated for H5N1 avian influenza at a hospital in Hanoi.  These newly confirmed cases bring the total, in Viet Nam, since mid-December 2004 to 59 cases, of which 18 were fatal. 
1001177	28 March 1996 Disease Outbreak Reported  Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD)  In the light of the 10 human cases of a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease reported by the United Kingdom on 20 March 1996, a WHO meeting of international experts in neurology, transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, epidemiology, veterinary science and public health is being organized on 2-3 April 1996 to review the present situation and to make further technical and public health recommendations as required. In particular, the meeting will identify those technical and scientific issues which must be addressed in developing best practices that will protect the consumer. WHO recommends that if similar disease is identified in any other countries, the national health authorities should be immediately notified. The conclusions of the meeting will be published in the Weekly Epidemiological Record. 
1001178	The Ministry of Health (MoH) notified WHO that between 13 September and 1 October 2020, eight cases of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) including seven deaths were confirmed in animal breeders. Districts affected include Tidjikja and Moudjéria (Tagant region), Guerou (Assaba region) and Chinguetty (Adrar region). Laboratory confirmation of RVF infection was performed using a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the National Institute for Public Health Research (INRSP) in Nouakchott. The age of infected patients varied between 16 and 70 years old and included one woman and seven men. All seven deaths occurred among hospitalised patients with fever and haemorrhagic syndrome (petechia, gingivorrhagia) and vomiting.  Between 4 September and 7 November 2020, a total of 214 people were sampled and their samples have been sent to the INRSP for laboratory testing with a total of 75 testing positive for RVF (RT-PCR and serology by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Positive cases have been reported in 11 of 15 regions of the country: Brakna, Trarza, Gorgol, (on the border with Senegal), Adrar, Assaba, Hodh El Gharby, Hodh El Chargui, Guidimaka (on the border with Mali) and Nouakchott Sud, Nouakchott Ouest and Tagant. The Tagant region is the most affected (38/75, 51%) with principal hotspot districts being Tidjikja and Moudjeria. Thus far a total of 25 deaths have been reported from this outbreak.  Outbreaks in animals have also been confirmed in the regions of Assaba, Tagant, Brakna, Trarza, Hodh El Gharbi and Hodh El Chargui. The results of 557 animal samples taken as of 15 October 2020 showed that 74 camels, 52 small ruminants and 12 cattle were positive for Rift Valley Fever.     Public health response  Since the beginning of the outbreak, WHO has been working closely with the Ministry of Health to respond to the current outbreak and monitor the evolution of the epidemiological situation.  WHO is supporting the following public health activities being implemented to respond to the outbreak:  Regular coordination and technical meetings between public health and animal health sectors Coordination of the outbreak response activities at the human-animal interface in all affected regions Epidemiological investigation Reinforcement of diagnostic capacities Preparation of communication tools Mobilization of resources and expertise  Joint field missions by FAO, OIE and WHO experts are planned to support MOH and the Ministry of Rural Development in the prevention and control of RVF outbreaks, in particular with regards to laboratory capacities, surveillance and risk communication to various populations at risk, and in other aspects related to the “One Health” concept.     WHO risk assessment  Since the beginning of the outbreak, WHO has been working closely with the Ministry of Health to respond to the current outbreak and monitor the evolution of the epidemiological situation.  WHO is supporting the following public health activities being implemented to respond to the outbreak:  Regular coordination and technical meetings between public health and animal health sectors Coordination of the outbreak response activities at the human-animal interface in all affected regions Epidemiological investigation Reinforcement of diagnostic capacities Preparation of communication tools Mobilization of resources and expertise  Joint field missions by FAO, OIE and WHO experts are planned to support MOH and the Ministry of Rural Development in the prevention and control of RVF outbreaks, in particular with regards to laboratory capacities, surveillance and risk communication to various populations at risk, and in other aspects related to the “One Health” concept.     WHO advice  Rift Valley Fever is an environmentally-driven mosquito-borne zoonosis that primarily affects domestic animals (including cattle, sheep, camels and goats). Human cases often occur in proximity to outbreaks in livestock in an environment favourable for mosquito vectors to transmit the virus locally. Most human infections result from direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. Care must be taken when handling sick animals or human patients, their products and laboratory samples. Raising awareness of the risk factors of RVF infection as well as other protective measures such as vector control and protection against mosquito bites is the key to reduce human infection and deaths. Public health messages for risk reduction should focus on:  Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission as a result of unsafe animal husbandry and slaughtering practices. Practicing hand hygiene, wearing gloves and other appropriate individual protective equipment when handling sick animals or their tissues or when slaughtering animals Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission arising from the unsafe consumption of fresh blood, raw milk or animal tissue by thoroughly cooking before eating Reducing the risk of mosquito bites through the implementation of vector control activities (e.g. insecticide spraying and use of larvicide to reduce mosquito breeding sites), use of insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets and repellents, covering clothing Avoiding outdoor activity at peak biting times of the vector species  As outbreaks of RVF in animals precede human cases, the establishment of an active animal health surveillance system is essential in providing early warning for animal and public health authorities. Routine animal immunization in endemic areas can prevent RVF epizootics. Vaccination campaigns are not recommended during an outbreak as it may intensify transmission among the herd through needle propagation of the virus. Therefore, public education, livestock quarantine, and slaughter bans are perhaps the most effective measures against disease spread during the pre-outbreak and outbreak phases  WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on Mauritania or the affected area based on the current information available on this event.

1001179	 6 September 2014  In Cameroon, 2 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported from the East Region, with onset of paralysis on 26 June 2014 and 9 July 2014. Genetic sequencing of these latest isolated viruses confirms continued wild poliovirus circulation, gaps in surveillance resulting in undetected transmission and geographic expansion to new areas of the country.  The outbreak in Cameroon has been ongoing since at least October 2013. The outbreak continued into 2014, with international spread to Equatorial Guinea. In March 2014, WHO elevated the risk assessment of international spread of polio from Cameroon to very high, due to expanding circulation and influx of vulnerable refugee populations from Central African Republic (CAR). This risk assessment remains in place. Further undetected circulation in Cameroon cannot be ruled out. Moreover, the risk of virus spreading into CAR is considered to be particularly high given the large-scale population movements from CAR into Cameroon.  In May 2014, the Director-General of WHO declared the international spread of wild poliovirus to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), under the International Health Regulations. Cameroon is one of the countries that meets the criteria for ‘states currently exporting wild poliovirus’ and was therefore recommended to implement extraordinary measures to mitigate the risk of further international spread.  Cameroon has conducted seven nationwide supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) in 2014. The next subnational SIAs are planned for 23-26 August and 4-7 September in 2 regions (East and Adamaoua ) of the country, aiming to reach children aged less than ten years, and all age groups in formal and informal refugee camps. On 22 August, CAR started a series of five sub-national polio immunization activities that will cover the western half of the country and which will end with the September synchronized round covering the central block countries of the African region.  Outbreak response quality to date in Cameroon has varied by geographic area. The confirmation of new cases and undetected, geographically-expanded spread of transmission, has resulted in planning additional emergency outbreak response activities. Critical to success will be to ensure substantial improvement in the quality campaigns that reach all children multiple times with OPV. Equally important will be efforts to rapidly improve the quality of surveillance so that the full extent of the outbreak can be determined and tracked.  It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importations and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.  Vaccination recommendations for travellers to polio-affected areas are published at:  International travel and health 
1001180	30 May 2000 Disease Outbreak Reported  The Public Health Unit for the town of Walkerton, Ontario (population 5000) has reported an outbreak of E.coli O157. To date, 5 people have died and 27 are hospitalized. Exposure to E. coli is believed to have occurred between 12-15 May. Tests have confirmed E. coli contamination in the Walkerton water supply system. On 21 May, the Public Health Unit issued a "Boil Water Order" to the residents of Walkerton which is still in effect.  Investigations are underway by provincial and federal health and environmental authorities. 
1001181	14 September 2007  Between 23 August and 10 September 2007, the cumulative number of cases of acute watery diarrhoea reported from Sulaymaniyah province stands at 6,142 including 9 deaths (case fatality rate, CFR: 0,14%). Of these reported cases, Vibrio cholerae has been laboratory confirmed in 392 stool specimens.  From 29 July to 12 September 2007, the health authorities of Kirkuk province reported a total of 6,749 cases of acute diarrhoeal disease including 1 death (CFR: 0,01%). The first index case of cholera, confirmed by laboratory test, was reported on 14 August 2007. The outbreak continues to spread into Erbil province, where, between 1 and 10 September 2007, 11,641 cases of diarrhoeal disease with no deaths were reported. Among samples tested, 33 were identified as positive for V. cholerae.  Until now, there is no confirmed information that cholera has spread to other parts of Iraq. A stool sample collected from a suspect case in Baghdad has tested negative for V. cholerae. Another suspect case detected in Mosul is currently being investigated.  The Government of Iraq has mobilized a multi-sectoral response to the outbreak. A high-level National Committee on Cholera Preparedness and Outbreak Response has been established. The health authorities of affected provinces are implementing public health control measures, including regular water quality testing, to contain the outbreak and to mitigate its effect on the population.  WHO, along with other UN agencies, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and international NGOs, continue to support the Ministry of Health and local health authorities in ongoing response operations. WHO is procuring emergency supplies such as chlorine tablets, rapid diagnostic tests and interagency diarrhoeal diseases kits, as well as disseminating technical guidelines on case management. Social mobilization campaigns are being implemented with the participation of religious and community leaders.  In controlling the spread of cholera, WHO does not recommend any special restrictions to travel or trade to or from affected areas.  For more information WHO cholera fact sheet 
1001182	28 March 2007  The Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population has announced two new human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection. The cases have been confirmed by the Egyptian Central Public Health Laboratory and by the US Naval Medical Research Unit No.3 (NAMRU-3).  The first case, a 6-year-old girl from Qena Governorate, was admitted to hospital on 25 March with symptoms. The second case, a 5-year-old boy from Menia Governorate, was also hospitalised with symptoms on 25 March. Both children remain in a stable condition. Initial investigations indicate exposure to sick birds in both cases.  Of the 29 cases confirmed to date in Egypt, 13 have been fatal. 
1001183	 26 December 2014  Between 8 and 16 December 2014, the National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) notified WHO of 3 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including 1 death.  Details of the cases are as follows: A 29-year-old, non-national female from Taif city who developed symptoms on 9 December. She sought medical advice on 14 December and was admitted to hospital on 15 December. The patient has no comorbidities. While working as a nurse in an isolation ward, she came into contact with a laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV case. The patient has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Currently, she is in stable condition and remains in isolation. A 70-year-old, non-national male from a village near Jubail city who developed symptoms on 10 December. He was admitted to hospital on 15 December. The patient has comorbidities as well as a history of frequent camel contact and of raw camel products consumption. He has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Currently, he is in ICU in critical condition. A 61-year-old male from Najran city who developed symptoms on 1 December. He was admitted to hospital on 6 December. The patient had comorbidities as well as a history of frequent camel contact and of raw camel products consumption. In the 14 days prior to the onset of symptom, he visited a health care facility that, however, had no links to MERS-CoV cases. He had no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days that preceded the onset of symptoms. The patient was admitted to ICU but passed away on 14 December.  Contact tracing of household contacts and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases.  The National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia also notified WHO of the death of 1 previously reported MERS-CoV case.  Globally, the WHO has been notified of 941 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 347 related deaths  WHO advice  Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.  Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.  Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.  Food hygiene practices should be observed.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions. 
1001184	24 January 2000 Disease Outbreak Reported  An outbreak of dysentery was confirmed in November from samples collected in the western area of the country caused by Shigella flexneri. On 29 December 1999, Shigella dysenteriae type 1 (Sd1) was isolated in one of six stool samples at the Institut Pasteur laboratory in Paris. Both strains were senstive to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin. Two more cases of Sd1 were confirmed on 19 January in Moyamba District (southern area) and Koinadugu District (northern area). Reports from 6 December 1999 to 16 January provided by the Ministry of Health give a total of 3094 cases of shigellosis with 132 deaths (CFR 4.27).  The outbreak appears to be spreading and a rapid epidemiological assessment of the situation is being planned through a WHO mission to the affected areas. 
1001185	02 November 2001 Disease Outbreak Reported  Through the WHO Collaborating Centres, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), WHO is continuing to monitor the situation in the United States. For the latest information from CDC, click here. In addition, a detailed report on the anthrax outbreak is available in CDC's Mortality and Morbidity Weekly Report (MMWR). 
1001186	 20 February 2017  Between 19 January and 14 February 2017, a total of 304 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection have been reported to WHO from mainland China though the China National IHR focal point.  On 19 January 2017, the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China (NHFPC) notified WHO of 111 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus. On 24 January 2017, the NHFPC notified WHO of 31 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus. On 30 January 2017, the NHFPC notified WHO of 41 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus. On 7 February 2017, the NHFPC notified WHO of 52 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus. On 14 February 2017, the NHFPC notified WHO of 69 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.  Details of the cases  Between 19 January and 14 February 2017, the NHFPC reported a total of 304 human cases of infection with avian influenza A(H7N9). Onset dates range from 13 December 2016 to 9 February 2017. Of these 304 cases, 86 are female (28%). Cases range in age from 3 to 85 years, with a median age of 58 years. The cases are reported from Jiangsu (67), Zhejiang (53), Guangdong (32), Anhui (31), Jiangxi (27), Hunan (26), Fujian (20), Hubei (20), Sichuan (6), Guizhou (4), Henan (4), Shandong (4), Shanghai (3), Liaoning (2), Yunnan (2), Beijing (1), Hebei (1), and Guangxi (1).  At the time of notification, there were 36 deaths, two cases had mild symptoms and 82 cases were diagnosed as either pneumonia (34) or severe pneumonia (48). The clinical presentations of the other 184 cases are not available at this time. 144 cases reported exposure to poultry or live poultry market, 11 cases have no clear exposure to poultry or poultry-related environments. 149 cases are under investigation.  Two clusters of two-person were reported:  A 22-year-old female (mother of 3-year-old girl case who had symptom onset on 29 January 2017, died on 7 February 2017) reported from Yunnan province. She had developed symptom on 4 February 2017. She took care of her daughter during her daughter was sick. Both are reported to expose to poultry in Jiangxi province. A 45-year-old female (previously reported on 9 January) from Sihui city, Guangdong province. She had symptom onset on 17 December 2016, and died on 24 December 2016. She was exposed to poultry. Another case was a 43-year-old female from Guangzhou city, Guangdong province. She had symptom onset on 30 December 2016 and was admitted to hospital on the same day. She is the sister of the 45-year old female described above. She took care of her hospitalized sister but also had exposure to poultry. At the time of reporting, she was suffering from pneumonia.  While common exposure to poultry is likely, human to human transmission cannot be ruled out.  To date, a total of 1222 laboratory-confirmed human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported through IHR notification since early 2013.  Public health response  Considering the increase in the number of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) since December 2016, the Chinese government has enhanced measures such as:  Strengthened early diagnosis and early treatment, treatment of severe cases to reduce occurrence of severe cases and deaths. Convened meetings to further deploy prevention and control measures. Conducted public risk communication and sharing information with the public. The NHFPC strengthened epidemic surveillance, conducted timely risk assessment and analysed the information for any changes in epidemiology. The NHFPC requested local NHFPCs to implement effective control measures on the source of outbreaks and to minimize the number of affected people. The NHFPC, joined by other departments such as agriculture, industry and commerce, Food and Drug Administration, re-visited Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui and Guangdong provinces where more cases occurred for joint supervision. The affected provinces have also strengthened multisectoral supervision, inspection and guidance on local surveillance, medical treatment, prevention and control and promoted control measures with a focus on live poultry market management control. Relevant prefectures in Jiangsu province have closed live poultry markets in late December 2016 and Zhejiang, Guangdong and Anhui provinces have strengthened live poultry market regulations. WHO risk assessment  While similar sudden increases in the number of human avian influenza A(H7N9) cases identified have been reported in previous years the number of cases reported during this season is exceeding previous seasons. The number of human cases with onset from 1 October 2016 accounts for nearly one-third of all the human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection reported since 2013.  However, human infections with the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus remain unusual. Close observation of the epidemiological situation and further characterization of the most recent human viruses are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures timely.  Most human cases are exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, and live poultry vending continues, further human cases can be expected. Additional sporadic human cases may be also expected in previously unaffected provinces as it is likely that this virus circulates in poultry of other areas of China without being detected.  Although small clusters of human cases with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported including those involving healthcare workers, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore the likelihood of further community level spread is considered low.  WHO advice  WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid, if possible, poultry farms, contact with animals in live bird markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water, and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.  WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling in or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.  WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions. 
1001187	5 January 2004 Results from laboratory tests received today have confirmed a case of SARS in a 32-year-old man in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong. The patient is a television producer who has been under treatment, in isolation, at a hospital in the provincial capital, Guangzhou, since 20 December.  This is the first confirmed case of SARS in 2004, and the first case not linked to a laboratory accident that has occurred since the initial outbreak of SARS was declared contained on 5 July 2003. Laboratory-related cases occurred after that date in Singapore in September and in Taiwan, China in December of last year.  The Guangdong case has been under investigation, with WHO support, since 26 December, when the suspected case was initially reported by Chinese authorities. Previous diagnostic tests produced inconclusive results. In view of the limitations of SARS diagnostic tests, confirmation of positive results by a WHO-designated reference laboratory is required for a definitive diagnosis of SARS.  The confirmatory tests were conducted in Hong Kong by both the University of Hong Kong at the Queen Mary Hospital and the Government Virus Unit of the Department of Health. Both laboratories are members of the WHO Multicentre Collaborative Network for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Diagnosis that collectively identified the SARS coronavirus in mid-April 2003, and have considerable diagnostic expertise.  The source of infection for this newly confirmed case remains unclear. Several lines of investigation last year suggest that SARS may have originated from contact with wild animals sold for human consumption at live markets in southern China. Studies conducted last year detected a SARS-like virus in some animal species, including the masked palm civet. Retrospective analysis of patient records has linked several of the earliest cases, which began occurring in Guangdong in mid-November 2002, to contact with wild animals. However, no animal reservoir of the SARS coronavirus has been conclusively identified to date.  Epidemiological investigations in China have not yet been able to link the patient to exposure to wild animals or any other known or suspected source of the virus.  Chinese authorities have introduced several measures as investigation of the case has evolved. The patient has been treated in isolation since his hospitalization on 20 December, four days after the onset of symptoms. All contacts have been traced and followed up. All are reported to be free of symptoms and most have been released from quarantine, suggesting that no further transmission has occurred. Surveillance for additional cases has been intensified in Guangdong and other provinces.  The single isolated case does not constitute grounds for issuing a SARS alert or recommending any restrictions on travel or trade.  At the request of Chinese authorities, additional WHO teams are being sent this week to assist in research aimed at identifying the source of infection and preventing further cases.  The first cases of SARS occurred in Guangdong in mid-November 2002. The disease began to spread internationally in late February 2003, eventually causing more than 8000 cases, with 774 deaths, in 27 countries. 
1001188	Disease Outbreak News  25 March 2014 - On 20 March 2014, the National IHR Focal Point of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) notified WHO of an additional laboratory-confirmed case of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).  Details of the case provided to WHO are as follows: A 49 year-old man from Abu Dhabi with underlying medical conditions. He was admitted to a hospital on 27 February and was discharged on 9 March following improvement in his condition. On 16 March, he was readmitted to the hospital and is currently in a critical condition. Laboratory-confirmation was done on 19 March. The patient has no history of recent travel. He has no reported contact with animals but had contact with a recent laboratory-confirmed case notified to WHO on 11 March. Both the patients received treatment in the same hospital on 1 March. Further epidemiological investigation is ongoing.  Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 199 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 84 deaths.  WHO advice  Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.  Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. Health-care facilities that provide for patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, health-care workers and visitors. Health care workers should be educated, trained and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control.  It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because some have mild or unusual symptoms. For this reason, it is important that health-care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients – regardless of their diagnosis – in all work practices all the time.  Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.  Patients should be managed as potentially infected when the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.  Health-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.  People at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.  WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

1001190	14 March 2000 Disease Outbreak Reported  The diagnosis of Lassa fever in a 50 year old British national who had been working for the peacekeeping effort in rural Sierra Leone has been confirmed by virological tests performed at the Enteric and Respiratory Virus Laboratory at the Central Public Health Laboratory, London.  The patient 's condition is reported to have improved slightly, but he remains seriously ill. Monitoring of close contacts is continuing, and will be carried out through the potential incubation period of the illness.

1001191	From 1 through 31 August 2019, the National IHR Focal Point of Saudi Arabia reported 6 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) infection and one associated death. The cases were reported from Riyadh (3 cases), Taif (1 case), Quriyat (1 case), and Najran (1 case) regions. One of the cases reported (Case #4) is a household contact identified during the contact tracing investigation of Case #2.  The link below provides details of the 6 reported cases :  MERS-CoV cases reported from 1 through 31 August 2019xls, 119kb  From 2012 until 31 August 2019, the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases reported globally to WHO was 2464, with 850 associated deaths. The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) to date. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected member states.  WHO risk assessment  Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.  The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedary camels, animal products (for example, consumption of camel’s raw milk), or humans (for example, in a health care setting or household contacts).  WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.  WHO advice  Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.  Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV infection early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.  Early identification, case management and isolation, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.  MERS-CoV causes more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and compromised immune systems. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close unprotected contact with animals, particularly dromedary camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.  Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.  WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions. 
1001192	29 October 2004  Countries experiencing outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry need to be aware that domestic ducks may have acquired an important role in the transmission of highly pathogenic H5N1 to other poultry and, possibly, to humans as well.  A new laboratory study of domestic ducks infected with several 2004 H5N1 viruses shows that, when compared with infections caused by viruses from 2003, domestic ducks are shedding more virus for longer periods. The majority are doing so without showing symptoms of illness.  Findings from this study also show that, compared to highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses from previous outbreaks, the recent H5N1 viruses survive several days longer in the environment.  The study found that the quantities of virus excreted by healthy-looking ducks approach those excreted by diseased – and visibly very ill – chickens. This suggests that domestic ducks might now be acting as a “silent” reservoir for the H5N1 virus, which is highly pathogenic for chickens.1  To date, no evidence has linked human H5N1 cases to exposure to asymptomatic domestic ducks. However, the laboratory findings come at a time when some human cases could not be traced to contact with diseased or dead poultry.  In terms of preventing further human cases, it is of public health concern that ducks may be infected and shed virus for long periods, yet issue no “warning signal” in the form of visible signs and symptoms that alert people to take precautions. The concern is greatest in rural areas of affected countries, where free-ranging ducks and chickens often mingle, frequently sharing the same water supplies.  The new findings expand on recent evidence, based on characterization of H5N1 viruses from southern China, that domestic ducks have played a central role in generating and maintaining H5N1, in its highly pathogenic form, in parts of Asia.2  Findings pointing to an altered role for domestic ducks join other recent evidence that the H5N1 virus circulating in parts of Asia has increased its pathogenicity in chickens and mice (a laboratory model for mammals), and has expanded its host range to include mammals, such as felines, not previously considered susceptible to infection.  Public health recommendations for affected countries  – Investigations of human cases should now include possible exposure to apparently healthy domestic ducks, as well as to diseased or dead poultry, as a risk factor for infection.  – Advice for people living in an affected area should be revised to include precautions for apparently healthy ducks similar to those for visibly ill poultry.  – Ducks should not be kept as pets or allowed to enter households.  – Water supplies for human use should not be drawn from open ponds used by domestic ducks and should be stored in ways that prevent contact with ducks.  – Once prepared and properly cooked, duck meat and eggs do not pose a risk to human health.  – Significant exposure can occur during home slaughtering and preparation prior to cooking, and these risks need to be addressed.  WHO, FAO, and OIE recognize that the altered role of domestic ducks in the transmission cycle of H5N1 should be addressed as it may complicate efforts to control the disease in poultry and prevent further human cases.  Research on the prevalence of asymptomatic infection in ducks in Asia is urgently needed. Such information will allow a focused approach to the prevention of human cases arising from exposure to apparently healthy domestic ducks.  The wider implications of the role played by domestic ducks are being jointly considered by FAO and OIE in formulating a long-term strategy for bringing the current outbreaks in poultry under control. With the H5N1 virus now endemic in parts of Asia, significant changes in farming practices may be needed to control the disease, especially in rural areas, and thus reduce opportunities for community-wide exposure.  In animals, surveillance remains the key to prevention and control, and this activity needs to be adequately supported.  FAO and OIE have recently issued comprehensive guidelines for responding to the outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry in Asia:  The two agencies are conducting research on the epidemiology of H5N1 infection in ducks and on the use of vaccination to control infection.  1 In the past, outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry began following the primary introduction of a virus, of low pathogenicity, probably carried by a wild bird. The virus then required several months of circulation in domestic poultry in order to mutate from a form causing very mild disease to a form causing highly pathogenic disease, with a mortality approaching 100%. Only viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes are capable of mutating to cause highly pathogenic disease. In the present outbreaks, however, asymptomatic domestic ducks can directly introduce the virus, in its highly pathogenic form, to poultry flocks.  2 Li KS, Wang J, Smith GJD et al.

1001193	7 April 2013 - As of 7 April 2013 (16:30 CET), the Chinese health authorities notified WHO of an additional three laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with influenza A(H7N9) virus.  The first patient is a 59-year-old man resident of Shanghai, who became ill on 25 March 2013, and is now in critical condition. The second patient is a 55-year-old man from Anhui who became ill on 28 March 2013, and is now in stable condition. The third patient is a 67-year-old man from Shanghai who became ill on 29 March 2013, and is considered a mild case.  To date, a total of 21 cases have been laboratory confirmed with influenza A(H7N9) virus in China, including six deaths, 12 severe cases and three mild cases.  More than 530 close contacts of the confirmed cases are being closely monitored. In Jiangsu, investigation is ongoing into a contact of an earlier confirmed case who developed symptoms of illness.  The Chinese government is actively investigating this event and has heightened disease surveillance. Retrospective testing of recently reported cases with severe respiratory infection may uncover additional cases that were previously unrecognized. An inter-government task force has been formally established, with the National Health and Family Planning Commission leading the coordination along with the Ministry of Agriculture and other key ministries. The animal health sector has intensified investigations into the possible sources and reservoirs of the virus.  WHO is in contact with national authorities and is following the event closely. The WHO-coordinated international response is also focusing on work with WHO Collaborating Centres for Reference and Research on Influenza and other partners to ensure that information is available and that materials are developed for diagnosis and treatment and vaccine development. No vaccine is currently available for this subtype of the influenza virus. Preliminary test results provided by the WHO Collaborating Centre in China suggest that the virus is susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir).  At this time there is no evidence of ongoing human-to-human transmission.  WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied. 
1001194	27 March 1997 Disease Outbreak Reported  As at 23 March 1997, a total of 24 798 cases with 2 933 deaths from epidemic meningitis had been reported in Benin, Burkina Faso, Gambia, Ghana, Mali, Niger, and Togo. The epidemic in Burkina Faso accounted for 42% (10,429 cases with 1 318 deaths) and in Ghana for 35% where the cumulative number of cases more than doubled from 3 757 (411 deaths) on 13 March to 8 671 (902 deaths) on 23 March. Most (95%) of the cases in Ghana have been reported in Upper East Region (6 364 cases, 497 deaths) and Northern Region (1 867 cases, 281 deaths). Cases have also been detected in Ashanti, Brong Ahafo and Upper West Regions. 
1001195	10 September 2008 - On 20 August 2008, cases of acute watery diarrhoea from Baghdad and Misan Province were laboratory confirmed as cholera. They constitute the first cholera cases detected in Iraq in 2008. By 28 August, seven cases had been laboratory confirmed, and a further 174 cases were suspected as cholera, bringing the total number of reported cases to 181 (128 in Missan and 53 in Baghdad). In the first week of September, the outbreak spread to Babil Province, south of Baghdad, where 116 suspect cases have now been identified. The presence of Vibrio cholerae, the bacterium causing the disease, has been confirmed in 21 cases. To date there have been 10 fatalities, three of whom tested positive for Vibrio cholera.  The re-emergence of cholera this year is not unexpected: in September 2007, the country was affected by a large outbreak (4696 cases with 24 deaths). The outbreak occurred mainly in northern Iraq, but sporadic cases were also detected in other provinces.  The Government of Iraq has mobilized a multi-sectoral response to the outbreak. Specific control measures have been reinforced and preventive measures to reduce the risk of transmission to unaffected areas have been put in place. Building on last year's experience, the Ministry of Health, together with WHO, have put in place an effective surveillance system that was able to capture the very first cases of cholera, enabling a timely response and facilitating the containment of the outbreak.  However, the overall quality of water and sanitation remains very poor, a factor known to greatly facilitate cholera contamination. Experience has shown that long term-prevention of cholera depends on access to safe water and adequate sanitation to prevent exposure and interrupt transmission. Improving water and sanitation infrastructures is therefore a long-term goal of WHO and its partners in Iraq and, in times of outbreaks, it is essential that immediate measures, such as water treatment at household level, health education and proper case management, are implemented rapidly. To this end, the Government of Iraq is providing chlorine tablets to families and is intensifying social mobilization activities.  In response to a request from the Ministry of Health, WHO is providing technical support, particularly in the area of laboratory testing. A joint Ministry of Health/WHO mission will be deployed shortly.  WHO does not recommend any restrictions to travel or trade to or from affected areas, as a means of controlling cholera outbreaks. Neighboring countries are encouraged, however, to reinforce their active surveillance and preparedness.

1001196	 29 October 2014  On 19 October 2014, the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China notified WHO of 2 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus, including 1 death.  Details of the cases are as follows A 44-year-old female from Urumqi City, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region who developed symptoms on 4 September 2014. The patient was admitted to hospital on 7 September and died on 9 September. The patient had a history of exposure to live poultry. A 7-year-old female from Chaoyang District, Beijing Municipality who developed symptoms on 16 September. The patient’s condition was mild and she was not hospitalized. The Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures Strengthen surveillance and situation analysis Reinforce case management and medical treatment Conduct risk communication with the public and release information.  WHO continues to closely monitor the H7N9 situation and conduct risk assessment. So far, the overall risk associated with the H7N9 virus has not changed.  WHO advice  WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.  WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.  WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions. 
1001197	21 April 2009 - The Ministry of Health of Egypt has reported two new confirmed human cases of avian influenza.  The first case is a 25-year old pregnant female from El Marg District, Cairo Governorate. Her symptoms began on 6 April and she was hospitalized at Ain Shams University hospital on 11 April where she was started on oseltamivir on 16 April. She is in a critical condition. Investigations into the source of her infection indicated close contact with sick poultry prior to becoming ill.  The second case is 18-month old female from Kellin District, Kafr Elsheikh Governorate. Her symptoms began on 15 April and she was hospitalized at Kafr Elsheikh Fever Hospital on 18 April where she was started on oseltamivir on the same day of hospitalization. Her condition is stable. Investigations into the source of infection indicated close contact with dead and sick poultry prior to becoming ill.  For both cases, infection with H5N1 avian influenza was confirmed by the Egyptian Central Public Health Laboratory and subsequently confirmed by the U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit No. 3 (NAMRU-3).  Of the 66 cases confirmed to date in Egypt, 23 have been fatal. 
1001198	 26 April 2016  Between 19 and 23 April 2016, the National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia notified WHO of 3 additional cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV).  Details of the cases A 58-year-old female from Abha city developed symptoms on 16 April and was admitted to a hospital on the same day. She first tested negative for MERS-CoV on 20 April, but later tested positive on 22 April. The patient has comorbidities and is a household contact of a case reported in a previous DON on 22 April (case no. 7). She has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to onset of symptoms. Currently the patient is in critical condition admitted to ICU, but not on mechanical ventilation. A 31-year-old male from Riyadh city developed symptoms on 15 April. He is a health care worker in a hospital and was admitted to the same hospital on 16 April. He tested positive for MERS-CoV on 18 April. The patient has no comorbid conditions. He has a history of caring for a case reported in a previous DON on 22 April (case no. 2). He has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to onset of symptoms. Currently the patient is in stable condition in home isolation. A 24-year-old male from Hofuf city was identified as a household contact of a case reported in a previous DON on 22 April (case no. 5). He is asymptomatic and was identified during contact tracing. He tested positive for MERS-CoV on 18 April. The patient has no comorbid conditions. He has a history of frequent contact with the same dromedaries and consumption of their raw milk. Currently, the patient is asymptomatic and in home isolation.  Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases.  Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1,728 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 624 related deaths.  WHO risk assessment  MERS-CoV causes severe human infections resulting in high mortality and has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.  The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.  WHO advice  Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.  Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.  Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.  Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.  Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. Raising awareness about MERS-CoV among travellers to and from affected countries is good public health practice.  CORRIGENDUM  * Please note that the total number of deaths stated above has been corrected from 623 (initially posted on 26 April 2016) to 624 (corrected on 27 April 2016). 
1001199	19 April 2006  The Ministry of Health in China has confirmed the country’s 17th case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The case occurred in a 21-year-old male migrant worker employed in Wuhan City, Hubei Province. He developed symptoms on 1 April. He is presently hospitalized in critical condition.  The man’s source of exposure is under investigation. No poultry outbreaks have been reported in Hubei Province since November 2005. His close contacts have been placed under medical observation.  To date, China has reported 17 cases of H5N1 infection. Of these, 11 have been fatal. 
1001200	10 August 2004  Between May 22 and July 30 2004, a total of 625 cases and 22 deaths from acute jaundice syndrome were reported from health clinics in the Greater Darfur region in Sudan. These cases were identified through the early warning alert and response system (EWAR) developed by WHO in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and other agencies. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) was confirmed by ELISA in 23 samples tested at the NAMRU3 laboratory in Cairo, Egypt. Suspected hepatitis cases have been reported from East, North and West Darfur but the highest incidence to date has been recorded in Morni IDP camp, West Darfur.  From a preliminary analysis of epidemiological data from the Morni IDP camp, a total of 149 cases and 8 deaths has been reported. 70% of the cases are female and the mean age is 24 years. Of the 8 deaths reported, 6 of them (75%) have occurred in pregnant women.  HEV is a waterborne disease usually transmitted by faecally contaminated water that can provoke major outbreaks in settings with poor sanitation. Refugees and IDPs residing in overcrowded camps are at highest risk of disease. Case fatality rates can vary from 1 to 4%, but may be as high as 20% in pregnant women who are more susceptible to severe forms of the disease.  This outbreak is a consequence of the inadequate and unsafe water supply and poor sanitary conditions the Darfur population has experienced during this crisis. Despite important efforts by international organizations, existing resources are insufficient to cover the basic needs of the IDPs. Without an immediate improvement in access to safe, clean water and better sanitation in these camps, the disease could spread rapidly and lead to increased mortality.  UNICEF is working with the federal and state ministries of health and nongovernmental organizations to increase the quality and quantity of water supply. Measures to improve sanitation include health promotion activities, safe handling of food, safe disposal of excreta and distribution of soap, which is supported by the United Nations Logistics Centre.  Additional field investigations are planned in order to focus current outbreak control measures, to better understand the epidemiology of HEV transmission in IDP and refugee camps and to elaborate specific recommendations for prevention and control of future HEV epidemics in such settings.
