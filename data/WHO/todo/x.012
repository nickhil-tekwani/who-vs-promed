1001201	16 August 2011 - Laboratory confirmed cases of West Nile Virus infection (WNV) have been reported in a number of European countries. From the beginning of July 2011 to 11 August 2011, WNV infection has officially been reported by Albania (2 cases), Greece (22 cases) Israel (6 cases), Romania (1 case) and the Russian Federation (11 cases). The reporting reflects higher awareness among healthcare workers, enhanced laboratory capacities and favourable weather conditions with rainfall and high temperatures leading to a substantial increase in mosquitoes such as Aedes and Culex species.  The WHO Regional Office for Europe, together with key partners − such as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the European Network for Diagnostics of “Imported” Viral Diseases (ENIVD) and the Network for Communicable Disease Control in Southern Europe and Mediterranean Countries (EpiSouth) − have been closely monitoring the regional situation of WNV.  WHO encourages the Member States to consider implementing relevant public health measures in order to minimize the impact of a potential WNV outbreak in countries at risk.  In humans, WNV infection is often an asymptomatic or mild febrile illness. About 20% of people who become infected with WNV will develop West Nile fever. It is estimated that approximately 1 in 150 persons infected with the West Nile virus will develop a more severe form of disease (also called neuro-invasive disease). People over the age of 50 and some immunocompromised persons (for example, transplant patients) are at the highest risk for getting severely ill when infected with WNV.  Taking into account that 80 % of infections with WNV are asymptomatic and fewer than 1 % present with severe symptoms such as meningitis or encephalitis, health care workers should consider the possibility of WNV infections during the epidemic period. Due to the unavailability of vaccine against human WNV infection, clinical management plays a key role in reducing severe outcome of the disease. At country level, laboratory capacity for diagnosis should be available. Enhanced human and veterinary surveillance activities will assist public health authorities to implement control measures at source.  Efforts to prevent disease transmission should focus primarily on personal and community protection against mosquito bites. The general population, especially in the affected areas, should be informed about the typical presentation of the disease and vector control strategies, particularly in the domestic environment.

1001202	06 September 2005  As of 31 August, two new polio cases were reported in Ethiopia, bringing the total number of cases associated with this outbreak to 15 in 2005. One of the two new cases occurred in Oromia Province, in the centre of the country, near the border with Somalia and had onset of paralysis on 1 July 2005. The second case, in Amhara region, the north-western part of Ethiopia, had onset of paralysis on 16 July. Both cases occurred after the National Immunization Days (NIDs) held on 23 May. Discussions are ongoing to advance the next NIDs to early October. Ethiopia had been polio-free since January 2001, before a poliovirus was imported into the country from neighbouring Sudan in December 2004.  For more information Global Polio Eradication Initiative 
1001203	26 July 2001 Disease Outbreak Reported  As of 25 July 2001, the Ministry of Health of Chad reported a total of 608 cases including 20 deaths. The majority of cases have been in N'djamena district, with 22 cases and 2 deaths reported from newly affected areas: 17 cases in Massakory, 4 cases in Bongo and 1 case in Moundou.  WHO is working with the Ministry of Health and Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) to assist in responding to the outbreak. Control measures including strengthening surveillance, health education and improvement of public hygiene in food outlets. WHO have provided additional supplies.     
1001204	Disease outbreak news  17 December 2013 - WHO has been informed of an additional two laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia.  The first case is a 51 year-old female from Saudi Arabia, living in Jawf province with onset of symptoms on 20 November 2013. She has underlying chronic disease and was transferred to Riyadh for treatment in an intensive care unit. She had no reported contact with animals. The epidemiological investigation is ongoing. The second case is a 26 year-old female who is a non-Saudi healthcare worker in Riyadh. She is asymptomatic. She had reported contact with a 37 year-old male laboratory confirmed case that was reported to WHO on 21 November 2013.  Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 165 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 71 deaths.  Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.  Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations.  Patients diagnosed and reported to date have had respiratory disease as their primary illness. Diarrhoea is commonly reported among the patients and severe complications include renal failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with shock. It is possible that severely immunocompromised patients can present with atypical signs and symptoms.  Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers and visitors.  All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.  People at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.  WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.  WHO has convened an Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR) to advise the Director-General on the status of the current situation. The Emergency Committee, which comprises international experts from all WHO Regions, unanimously advised that, with the information now available, and using a risk-assessment approach, the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have not at present been met. 
1001205	5 May 2009 - As of 16:00 GMT, 5 May 2009, 21 countries have officially reported 1490 cases of influenza A (H1N1) infection.  Mexico has reported 822 laboratory confirmed human cases of infection, including 29 deaths. The United States has reported 403 laboratory confirmed human cases, including one death.  The following countries have reported laboratory confirmed cases with no deaths - Austria (1), Canada (140), China, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (1), Colombia (1), Costa Rica (1), Denmark (1), El Salvador (2), France (4), Germany (9), Ireland (1), Israel (4), Italy (5), Netherlands (1), New Zealand (6), Portugal (1), Republic of Korea (2), Spain (57), Switzerland (1) and the United Kingdom (27).  It is considered prudent for people who are ill to delay international travel and for people developing symptoms following international travel to seek medical attention, in line with guidance from national authorities. Individuals are advised to wash hands thoroughly with soap and water on a regular basis and should seek medical attention if they develop any symptoms of influenza-like illness.  WHO advises no restriction of regular travel or closure of borders.  There is no risk of infection from this virus from consumption of well-cooked pork and pork products.  Further information on the situation will be available on the WHO website on a regular basis. 
1001206	 29 June 2016  On 12 June 2016, the National IHR Focal Point of Qatar notified WHO of 1 additional case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.  Details of the case  A 23-year-old, non-national male from Al-Shahaniya City presented with symptoms at a health centre on 8 June. The patient, who has no comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on 9 June. He has a history of frequent contact with camels and consumption of their raw milk. The patient also has a history of travel to Saudi Arabia on 28 May. He is currently in stable condition admitted to a negative pressure isolation room on a ward.  The Department of Health Protection and Communicable Disease Control within the Ministry of Public Health immediately carried out case investigation and contact tracing. All the healthcare workers who attended the patient followed recommended infection prevention and control measures. Respiratory swabs were collected from 26 household contacts and all results were negative for MERS-CoV by PCR. All contacts were monitored until the end of the 14-day period following last exposure to the case and none of them developed symptoms. Health education messages about appropriate preventive measures were shared with all contacts, who were also advised to comply with the recommended MERS-CoV preventive measures and to report to health authorities on the development of any respiratory symptoms. The Animal Health Resources Department has been notified and investigation of camels is ongoing.  Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1,769 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 630 related deaths.  WHO risk assessment  MERS-CoV causes severe human infections resulting in high mortality and has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.  The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.  WHO advice  Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.  Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.  Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.  Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.  Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. Raising awareness about MERS-CoV among travellers to and from affected countries is good public health practice. 
1001207	Weekly update  23 December 2009 - As of 20 December 2009, worldwide more than 208 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including at least 11516 deaths.  WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member states and through monitoring of multiple sources of data.  Situation update:  In the temperate zone* of the northern hemisphere, transmission of pandemic influenza virus remains active and geographically widespread, however overall disease activity has recently peaked in much of the hemisphere. There continues to be increases in influenza activity in later affected areas of central and eastern Europe, and in parts of west, central, and south Asia.  In United States and Canada, influenza activity continues to be geographically widespread but overall levels of ILI** have declined substantially to near the national baseline level in the US and below the seasonal baseline in Canada. Although numbers of hospitalizations and death in US have declined steadily since their peak over 6 weeks ago, the proportional mortality due to pneumonia and influenza (P&I mortality) remains elevated above the epidemic threshold for the 11th consecutive week. In Canada, rates of ILI, numbers of outbreaks, and proportions of samples testing positive for influenza have declined substantially since peaking six weeks ago. Approximately 53% of hospitalized cases in Canada had an underlying medical condition; cases with underlying medical conditions tended to be older (compared to those without), and were at increased risk of hospitalization and death. Also from Canada, a smaller proportion of hospitalized cases during the winter transmission season compared with those hospitalized cases during the summer transmission season, were persons of aboriginal origin (3.9% vs. 20.3%).  In Europe, geographically widespread and active transmission of pandemic influenza virus continued to be observed throughout the continent, however, overall pandemic influenza activity appears to have recently peaked across a majority of countries. At least ten countries reported that 30% or more of their sentinel respiratory specimens had tested positive for influenza. Greater than 98% of subtyped influenza A viruses detected in Europe were pandemic H1N1 2009, however, seasonal influenza viruses (H1N1, H3N2, and type B) continue to be detected at low levels. Of note, a few countries are experiencing increasing disease activity and have yet to peak (Hungary and Montenegro ), while several others are experiencing a resurgence in activity (Serbia, Ukraine, Georgia, and Turkey). Rates of ILI have returned to near seasonal baselines in the earlier affected areas of western Europe (Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland, and Iceland) and a substantial decline in activity has been observed in much of northern Europe over the past month. In central and southern Europe, where influenza virus transmission has been most active recently, disease activity in most places has either plateaued (Albania, Czech Republic, Estonia) or begun to decline (Austria, Germany, Poland, Latvia, Croatia, Slovakia, and Greece). Further east, influenza activity appears to be variable, with the Russian Federation reporting a steady decline in rates of ARI after a recent peak three weeks ago; while several other countries are reporting increases in rates of ILI/ARI (Ukraine and Georgia). In Europe, the highest rates of ILI have been recorded among children 0-4 years of age (in 15 countries) and among older children 5-14 years of age (in 18 countries). Detections of RSV in Europe continued to increase over the past six weeks, partially accounting for elevated ILI activity among young children in some countries.  In Western and Central Asia, limited data suggest that influenza virus circulation remains active throughout the region, however disease trends remain variable. Increasing respiratory diseases activity continued to be reported in Kazakhstan and in Egypt; while several others countries, Israel and Oman, have been reporting declining trends of respiratory diseases activity after recording a peak of activity approximately one month ago.  In East Asia, the situation remains similar to last week; influenza transmission remains active but appears to be declining overall. Influenza/ILI activity has recently peaked and continues to decline in Japan, in northern and southern China, Chinese Taipei and in Mongolia. In southern Asia, influenza activity continues to increase in the northern India, Nepal, and, Sri Lanka.  In the tropical region of Central and South America and the Caribbean, influenza transmission remains geographically widespread but overall disease activity has been declining or remains unchanged in most parts, except for in Barbados and Ecuador, were recent increases in respiratory diseases activity have been reported.  In the temperate region of the southern hemisphere, sporadic cases of pandemic influenza continued to be reported without evidence of sustained community transmission.  The Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic, seasonal and other influenza viruses infecting, or with the potential to infect, humans including seasonal influenza. For more information on virological surveillance and antiviral resistance please see the weekly virology update (Virological surveillance data, below).  Weekly update (Virological surveillance data)  *Countries in temperate regions are defined as those north of the Tropic of Cancer or south of the Tropic of Capricorn, while countries in tropical regions are defined as those between these two latitudes. **Abbreviations: influenza-like-illness (ILI), acute respiratory infection (ARI), and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI)  Qualitative indicators (Week 29 to Week 50: 13 July - 13 December 2009)  The qualitative indicators monitor: the global geographic spread of influenza, trends in acute respiratory diseases, the intensity of respiratory disease activity, and the impact of the pandemic on health-care services.

1001208	4 March 2004  As of 3 March 2004, a total of 33 suspected cases including 8 deaths, were reported to WHO from five counties. Of the total cases, 2 from Bong county and 2 from Nimba county were laboratory confirmed by Institut Pasteur Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.  The first emergency mass immunization campaign started on 26 February 2004 in Bong county, targetting camps for Internally Displaced People (IDP). As of 1 March 2004, 42% of the target population (72 000) have been immunized.  Additional emergency mass immunization campaigns are planned to start in the next few weeks in Nimba county.  WHO, UNICEF and NGOs operating in Liberia are supporting the Ministry of Health in the implementation of the campaigns. 
1001209	 17 January 2017  On 5 January 2017, the Department of Health, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) notified WHO of a case of laboratory-confirmed human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus and on 9 January 2017, the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China (NHFPC) notified WHO of 106 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.  Details of the cases  On 5 January 2017, a human case of infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) was reported from the Department of Health, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR). The case is a 62-year-old man with underlying illnesses, who travelled to Zengcheng, Guangzhou on 15 December 2016. He developed influenza-like symptoms on 1 January 2017 while he was in Guangzhou. He was admitted to a hospital in Dongguan on 2 January 2017 and returned to Hong Kong SAR on 3 January 2017, where he was admitted to hospital on 4 January 2017 for further treatment. His condition deteriorated and he was transferred to an intensive care unit for further management. He passed away on 6 January 2017. His samples tested positive for A(H7N9) by RT-PCR on 5 January 2017. The patient reported no recent exposure to poultry or live poultry markets. Contact tracing is underway.  On 9 January 2017, 106 human cases of infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) were reported from the NHFPC. The onset dates ranged from 22 November 2016 to 29 December 2016. Of these 106 cases, 36 are female. The median age is 54 years (age range among the cases is 23 to 91 years old). The cases are reported from Jiangsu (52), Zhejiang (21), Anhui (14), Guangdong (14), Shanghai (2), Fujian (2) and Hunan (1). At the time of notification, there were 35 deaths and 57 severe cases. Eighty of the cases are reported to have had exposure to poultry or a live poultry market.  Two clusters were reported.  First cluster:  A 66-year-old male from Suzhou city, Jiangsu province. He had symptom onset on 25 November 2016, was admitted to hospital on 28 November 2016 and died on 12 December 2016. He was exposed to a live poultry market. A 39-year-old female from Suzhou city, Jiangsu province. She had symptom onset on 8 December 2016 and was admitted to hospital on the same day. She is the daughter of the 66-year old male. At the time of report, she was suffering from severe pneumonia.  Human-to-human transmission between the 66-year-old male and the 39-year-old female cannot be ruled out.  Second cluster:  A 66-year-old male from Hefei city, Anhui province. He had symptom onset on 16 December 2016, and was admitted to hospital on 17 December 2016 and died on 20 December 2016. He was exposed to a live poultry market. A 62-year-old male from Hefei city, Anhui province. He had symptom onset on 22 December 2016. He was admitted in the same ward as the 66-year old male. His current condition is severe.  Human-to-human transmission between the 66-year-old male and the 62-year-old male cannot be ruled out.  To date, a total of 916 laboratory-confirmed human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported through IHR notification since early 2013.  Public health response  Considering the increase of laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) in December 2016, the Chinese government has enhanced measures:  NHFPC strengthened epidemic surveillance, conducted timely risk assessment and studies for any changes in epidemiology. NHFPC requested local NHFPCs to implement effective control measures on the source of outbreaks and to minimize the number of affected people. Strengthened early diagnosis and early treatment, treatment of severe cases, and reduce occurrence of severe cases and deaths. Further enhanced medical treatment. Joint investigations between NHFPC and Ministries of agriculture, industry and commerce visited Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui and Guangdong provinces where more cases occurred for joint supervision, inspection and guidance on local surveillance, medical treatment, prevention and control and to promote control measures with focus on live poultry market management and cross-regional transportation. Relevant prefectures in Jiangsu province have closed live poultry markets in late December 2016 and Zhejiang, Guangdong and Anhui provinces have strengthened live poultry market regulations. Conducting public risk communication and sharing information with the public.  The Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health in Hong Kong SAR has taken the following measures:  Urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel. Issued an alert to doctors, hospitals, schools and institutions of the latest situation. WHO risk assessment  Similar sudden increases in the number of human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection have been observed in previous years during this period of time (December-January). Nevertheless close monitoring of the epidemiological situation and further characterization of the most recent viruses are critical to assess associated risk and to make timely adjustments to risk management measures.  Most human cases are exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, further human cases can be expected. Although small clusters of human cases with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported including those involving healthcare workers, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Based on available information we have, further community level spread is considered unlikely.  Human infections with the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus are unusual and because there is the potential for significant public health impact, it needs to be monitored closely.  WHO advice  WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid, if possible, poultry farms, contact with animals in live bird markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water, and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.  WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling in or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.  WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions. 
1001210	 5 June 2018  In response to the ongoing outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, WHO in collaboration with the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) and other partners, has developed a comprehensive strategic response plan for points of entry. The aim of the plan is to avoid the spread of the disease to other provinces or at the international level. The plan includes mapping strategic points of entry and the locations of areas where travellers congregate and interact with the local population, and therefore are at risk of Ebola virus disease transmission based on population movement. The plan also includes implementing health measures at the identified points of entry/traveller congregation points, such as risk communication and community engagement, temperature checks, provision of hand hygiene and sanitation materials, and the development of alert, investigation and referral procedures.  As of 18 May 2018, a total of 115 points of entry/traveller congregation points have been listed and mapped along cordon sanitaires in Mbandaka, Bikoro, Iboko, larger Equateur Province, and Kinshasa. Of these, some 30 points of entry have been prioritized for in-depth assessments and for implementing relevant prevention, detection and control measures. These include major ports and congregation points along the Congo river, as well as the two airports and the international port in Kinshasa. Areas of large gatherings such as markets are also being assessed. Along the Congo river there are many private smaller ports and points of congregation with a low volume of traffic. Proper screening cannot be conducted at all 115 points, and the efforts currently focus on the 30 prioritized points of entries/ traveller congregation points, as well as on risk communications activities and community engagement.  Entry and exit screening measures have been implemented at the Mbandaka airport, as well as in some terminals of the Kinshasa international airport. These include travel health declaration, visual observation for symptoms, temperature check and travel health promotion measures, as well as procedures for referral of suspect cases.  The International Health Regulations Emergency Committee, was convened by the WHO Director-General on 18 May 2018, and advised against the application of any travel or trade restrictions to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in relation to the current Ebola outbreak, as flight cancellations and other travel restrictions may hinder the international public health response and may cause significant economic damage to the affected country (see link below). The Emergency Committee also advised that exit screening, including at airports and ports on the Congo river, is considered to be of great importance; however entry screening, particularly in distant airports, is not considered to be of any public health or cost-benefit value.  Statement of the 1st meeting of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee  WHO is monitoring travel and trade measures in relation to the current outbreak. As of 28 May, 23 countries have implemented entry screening for international travellers coming from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but there are currently no restrictions of international traffic in place.  WHO advice  The Emergency Committee convened by the Director-General on 18 May 2018 noted that the Ebola outbreak does not currently meet the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The Committee issued comprehensive Public Health Advice , in particular with regards to the fact that there should be no international travel or trade restrictions, that neighbouring countries should strengthen preparedness and surveillance, and that during the response, safety and security of staff should be ensured, and protection of responders of national and international staff should prioritised.  WHO has also issued travel advice for international travellers in relation to the current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (see link below).  WHO recommendations for international travellers related to the Ebola virus disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Travellers going through the exit screening from the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Effective exit screening helps prevent the exportation and spread of disease to other areas. During exit screening at international airports and points of entry, travellers will be assessed for signs and symptoms of an illness consistent with Ebola virus disease, or identified as contacts potentially exposed to Ebola virus disease.  Travellers with a possible exposure to Ebola virus and who are sick should postpone international travel and seek immediate medical assistance if there is a possible exposure to Ebola virus disease; Any person with an illness consistent with Ebola virus disease will not be allowed to travel unless the travel is part of an appropriate medical evacuation (see link below); Travellers should plan to arrive early at the travel facility and expect delays related to public health screening; Travellers will be required to complete a Traveller Public Health Declaration, and these will be reviewed prior to clearance to board; Temperature measurement will be required, in addition to normal security provisions; Boarding may be denied based on public health criteria. Exit screening at airports, ports and land crossings: Interim guidance for Ebola virus disease Travellers with symptoms on board a conveyance  There is a possibility that a person who has been exposed to Ebola virus and developed symptoms may board a commercial flight or other mode of transport, without informing the transport company of his/her status. Such travellers should seek immediate medical attention upon arrival, mention their recent travel history, and then be isolated to prevent further transmission. Information of close contacts of this person on board the aircraft (e.g. passengers one seat away from the ill traveller on the same flight, including across an aisle, and crew who report direct body contact with the ill traveller) should be obtained through collaboration with various stakeholders at points of entry (e.g. airline reservation system) in order to undergo contact tracing.  Returning travellers  The risk of a traveller becoming infected with Ebola virus during a visit to the affected areas and developing disease after returning is extremely low, even if the visit included travel to areas where primary cases have been reported. Transmission requires direct contact with blood or fluids of infected persons or animals (alive or dead), all unlikely exposures for the average traveller (see link below).  Travel and transport risk assessment: Ebola Interim guidance for public health authorities and the transport sector  There is, however, a risk for health care workers and volunteers, especially if involved in caring for Ebola virus disease patients. The risk can be considered low, unless adequate infection prevention and control measures (such as use of clean water and soap or alcohol-based hand rubs, personal protective equipment, safe injection practices and proper waste management) are not followed, including at points of medical care at ports, airports and ground crossings.  As the incubation period for Ebola is between 2 to 21 days, travellers involved in caring for Ebola virus disease patients or who suspect possible exposure to Ebola virus in the affected areas, should take the following precautions for 21 days after returning:  Stay within reach of a good quality health care facility; Be aware of the symptoms of infection; and, Seek immediate medical attention (e.g. through hotline telephone numbers) and mention their recent travel history if they develop Ebola virus disease like symptoms. 
1001211	27 January 2004  Situation in Thailand  The Ministry of Public Health in Thailand has today confirmed a second death caused by human infection with the H5N1 strain of avian influenza virus.  The fatal case is a 6-year-old boy from Sukhothai province, whose infection with H5N1 was confirmed yesterday. He died today. He was Thailand’s third confirmed case of H5N1 avian influenza and the country’s second death from this disease.  The other fatal case in Thailand was another 6-year-old boy from Kanchanaburi province. He died on 25 January.  Overview of the current situation  To date, only two countries, Viet Nam and Thailand, have reported laboratory confirmed cases of H5N1 infection in humans. Viet Nam has reported 7 cases, 6 of them fatal. Thailand has reported 3 cases, 2 of them fatal.  The cases and deaths in humans coincide with outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in poultry populations in these two countries and several others in Asia. The disease in poultry is widespread in both Viet Nam and Thailand. WHO teams, drawn from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, are in both countries to support national authorities. Laboratories in the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network have been providing diagnostic and investigative support. WHO is collaborating closely with FAO and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).  Over the past few days, several countries in Asia have detected deaths in poultry flocks, and testing to determine the causative agent is under way.  The possible transmission of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza from animals to humans is of great concern. Testing for the presence of this particular strain takes several days and must be performed in specially equipped laboratories. 
1001212	22 May 2003Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 8046 probable SARS cases and 682 deaths have been reported from 28 countries. These figures represent an increase of 95 new cases and 16 deaths when compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in China (4), Hong Kong SA (3), Taiwan (8), and Singapore (1).  The cumulative total of probable cases surpassed 5000 on 28 April, 6000 on 2 May, and 7000 on 8 May.  Situation in Taiwan Taiwan authorities have today reported a record 60 new probable cases of SARS and 8 deaths, bringing the cumulative totals to 483 cases and 60 deaths. However, the large daily increases in new cases seen over the past week are due to a backlog in the investigation of pending cases and determination of which fit the case definition for probable SARS.  While the daily numbers of new cases indicate the size of the SARS outbreak in Taiwan, which is worrisome, they do not suggest an explosive escalation in the number of cases, as both older and new cases are being reported together on a daily basis. At present, the daily increases reflect a change in the way records have been kept, with cases in a “pending” category now being classified as either suspect or probable cases. As the backlog of pending cases is now being rapidly cleared, the daily reports should begin within days to give a more accurate picture of the evolution of the outbreak in Taiwan.  Since detection of its first suspect cases, Taiwan has promptly reported on the outbreak to WHO. The first two cases, who were hospitalized on 8 March, occurred in a man with a recent travel history to Guangdong Province and Hong Kong, and his wife, who had no recent travel history. The cases were officially recognized as suspect SARS cases on 14 March, two days after WHO issued a global alert about the emergence of a new disease with severe respiratory symptoms. A team from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, organized by WHO’s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, arrived in Taiwan on 16 March.  Taiwan initially experienced a gradual increase in the number of cases. As of 18 April, 29 cases had been reported. All were identified, through contact tracing and investigation of travel history, as either imported cases, cases in persons with a recent travel history to areas with local transmission, and family members and other close contacts of patients. The number of cases began to climb at the end of April, when local transmission in hospitals became the source of the majority of new infections. The number of probable cases reached 100 on 2 May, grew to 207 on 13 May, and now stands at 483.  Taiwan has now received supplementary protective equipment shipped urgently from Thailand yesterday. The problem of infection control in hospitals is being addressed as a top priority. Procedures were set up today to ensure rapid and efficient distribution of the new equipment.  WHO will be sending an additional 2 staff from Geneva to Taiwan over the weekend.  Data on in-flight transmission updated Following receipt of more complete data, WHO is updating its statistics on cases of in-flight transmission of SARS. The number of flights during which transmission of SARS may have occurred remains at four. The total number of cases resulting from exposure during these four flights has been revised to 27. One flight alone, CA112, which flew from Hong Kong to Beijing on 15 March, is now know to have accounted for 22 of the 27 cases.  WHO is aware of an additional 31 flights with symptomatic probable SARS cases on board. No evidence indicates that in-flight transmission occurred on any of these flights. No flights have been implicated in the transmission of SARS after 23 March 2003.  Complete data on seating information for all cases has not been obtained. However, it is now known that, on one flight, persons sitting seven rows in front and five row behind a person with symptomatic SARS developed the disease. WHO is aware of four flight attendants, of which two were on the CA112 flight, who have become infected.  Report from the joint team in Henan Province, China “Community-based surveillance and control methods seem to be an important contributor to the apparently low levels of SARS infection in China’s rural countryside,” Dr. James Maguire says. Dr Maguire returned to Beijing three days ago from a six-day visit to China’s Henan Province. He travelled as part of a joint Ministry of Health-WHO team. The group visited hospitals, clinics and basic health facilities in five prefectures in Henan.  A full report of the team’s findings is being prepared and will soon be released.  Dr Maguire says that numerous checkpoints on roads and at train and bus stations, where identification cards are checked and body temperatures recorded, seem to be an effective way of controlling the spread of SARS. “The fear of the disease is widespread. Combined with community surveillance and social and legal pressure, people are cooperating,” he says.  Henan officials told the investigators around 1.4 million workers had returned to the province during the long holiday period around May 1. Many came from areas with higher rates of SARS infection, like Beijing and Guangdong. During the period from 26 April to 15 May, the team was told that at the checkpoints 12,028 people were found to be feverish and 955 had a cough. They were referred to “fever clinics” – basic triage centers where they were put into single-room isolation for further assessment. “We were told that nine of these cases were confirmed as being infected with SARS and eight were suspected cases,” Dr Maguire says.  Ministry of Health statistics show there were 15 probable cases, including one in a health worker, and six suspect cases of SARS reported from Henan province as of May 22.  Usually, returning workers from affected areas must stay under house quarantine for 15 days, staying apart from their family in a single room. Dr Maguire says to help with farming work, some local governments are offering financial assistance to have hired workers perform the necessary fieldwork or grants to enable people to buy farm machinery to lower the demand for human farm labour.  “The screening at checkpoints and quarantining may seem like hitting a fly with a hammer, but they seem to be working,” Dr Maguire says. “Combined with the extreme social pressure brought on by the fear of SARS, China might have hit on a way to fight the spread of the disease.” 
1001213	 1 September 2015  Between 26 and 28 August 2015, the National IHR Focal Point of Jordan notified WHO of 4 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including 1 death. All these cases are associated with a MERS-CoV outbreak currently occurring in a hospital in Amman city.  Details of the cases A 60-year-old male living in Jeddah city, Saudi Arabia travelled to Amman city, Jordan on 28 July. He developed symptoms on 31 July and, on 10 August, was admitted to hospital. The patient, who had comorbidities, was treated symptomatically and discharged on 18 August. As symptoms relapsed, on 20 August, the patient was admitted to another hospital in Amman on 23 August. He tested positive for MERS-CoV on 25 August and passed away on 27 August. Investigation of history of exposure to known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing. A 38-year-old male from Kuwait city, Kuwait travelled to Amman city, Jordan on 7 August. He developed symptoms on 12 August and, on 17 August, was admitted to the hospital where a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case was hospitalized (case no. 1 – see above). Since his arrival in Amman city, he frequently visited a family member at the same hospital. The patient, who has no comorbidities, has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. He tested positive for MERS-CoV on 26 August. Currently, the patient is in critical condition in ICU. Investigation of possible epidemiological links with the index case or with shared health care workers is ongoing. A 76-year-old male from Amman city developed symptoms. On 16 August, due to his chronic condition, the patient was admitted to the hospital where a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case was hospitalized (case no. 1 – see above). He was discharged on the same day. On 20 August, the patient was admitted to the same hospital for a medical procedure for his chronic condition and, on 24 August, was discharged. On 25 August, he developed symptoms and was admitted to the same hospital. The patient tested positive for MERS-CoV on 25 August. Currently, he is in critical condition in ICU. Investigation of possible epidemiological links with MERS-CoV cases admitted to his hospital or with shared health care workers is ongoing. A 47-year-old female from Kuwait city, Kuwait travelled to Amman city, Jordan on 15 July. She was identified through the screening of contacts of a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case (case no. 2 – see above). The patient, who has no comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on 27 August. Currently, she is asymptomatic in home isolation. The patient visited her family members at the hospital where a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case was hospitalized (case no. 1 – see above). She has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms.  Contact tracing of household contacts and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases. The National IHR Focal Point of Jordan informed the National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia about the index case to trace contacts in Saudi Arabia.  Globally, the WHO has been notified of 1,478 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 516 related deaths.  WHO advice  Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.  Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.  Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.  Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.  WHO remains vigilant and is monitoring the situation. Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. Raising awareness about MERS-CoV among travellers to and from affected countries is good public health practice.  Public health authorities in host countries preparing for mass gatherings should ensure that all recommendations and guidance issued by WHO with respect to MERS-CoV have been appropriately taken into consideration and made accessible to all concerned officials. Public health authorities should plan for surge capacity to ensure that visitors during the mass gathering can be accommodated by health systems. 
1001214	23 July 2012 - The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has reported a sharp increase in the number of cholera cases in the armed conflict area of North Kivu. According to the report, 368 new cases were reported from epidemiological week 24 (11-17 June) to epidemiological week 26 (25 June-1 July). The most affected areas include Birambizo, Goma, Karisimbi, Kiroshe, Mutwanga, Mweso and Rwanguba.  There is concern that the security situation may increase difficulty in accessing the health-care facilities and could increase the number of severe and fatal cases. The current armed conflict in North Kivu also poses a risk of international spread of the disease to neighbouring countries such as Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan and Uganda.  North Kivu is one the five provinces of eastern DRC where cholera is endemic. Vibrio cholerae was confirmed in the AMI-Kivu laboratory since 2011.  Response  Epidemiological investigation conducted by national authorities and other partners, including Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), Merlin, and International Rescue Committee (IRC) indicated that insufficient access to safe water supply remains the main cause of the epidemic in North Kivu.  Patients are being treated with infusions and antibiotics as appropriate, at treatment centres. Interventions to control the epidemic that are being carried out include education and communication; management of cases; increased surveillance; hygiene and sanitation; and provision of safe drinking water.  WHO is working to support national authorities in response to the cholera outbreak and the broader humanitarian emergency resulting from conflict and population displacement. 
1001215	11 April 2011 - The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh has confirmed a new case of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus.  The case is a 2 years old male from Kamalapur, Dhaka. He developed symptoms on 1 March. He visited the influenza sentinel surveillance site on 9 March where he was sampled. He completely recovered.  Detailed epidemiological investigation and contact follow up was conducted by a team from the Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh ( ICDDRB) and WHO Bangladesh, and no further cases were identified.  The investigation into the source of infection indicate that the case had exposure to sick poultry. Although the case is from the same locality as the previous case they had no direct contact with each other.  The case was confirmed as being infected with A(H5N1) by the Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR). 
1001216	7 May 2013 - As of 7 May 2013 (11:00 CET), the National Health and Family Planning Commission, China notified WHO of an additional two laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.  The first patient is a 69-year-old man from Fujian province who became ill on 29 April 2013 and the second patient is a 9-year-old boy, also from Fujian province, who became ill on 26 April 2013.  Additionally five patients earlier reported have died.  To date, a total of 130 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus including 31 deaths have been reported to WHO. Contacts of the confirmed cases are being closely monitored.  The authorities in the affected locations continue to implement prevention and control measures.  Investigations into the possible sources of infection and reservoirs of the virus are ongoing. Until the source of infection has been identified and controlled, it is expected that there will be further cases of human infection with the virus.  So far, there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission.  WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied. 
1001217	8 May 2006  The Ministry of Health in Indonesia has confirmed the country’s 33rd case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The case, which was fatal, occurred in a 30-year-old man from Greater Jakarta. He developed symptoms on 17 April, was hospitalized on 21 April, and died on 26 April.  An investigation to determine the source of his infection is continuing. He lived in close proximity to pens where animals, including poultry, were kept.  Of the 33 laboratory-confirmed cases in Indonesia, 25 have been fatal. 
1001218	 23 March 2016  On 9 March 2016, the National IHR Focal Point of Togo notified WHO of the country’s first 2 cases of Lassa fever infection.*  Details of the cases The first case was a 47-year-old, non-national, male health care professional who worked in Sansanné-Mango, Savanes Region in the North of Togo. The patient developed diarrhoea, vomiting and fever on 12 February and was treated for malaria. On 26 February, he was medically evacuated with a diagnosis of malaria to Cologne, Germany, where he died of multi-organ failure within hours of arrival. He had no history of travel in the 21 days prior to the onset of symptoms. On 9 March, postmortem diagnosis of Lassa Fever was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing at the Bernhard Nocht Institute (BNI) in Hamburg, Germany. The second case is a 33-year-old, non-national, male health care professional who provided care to the above confirmed case. On 5 March, he developed signs and symptoms similar to those of case 1. On 9 March, the patient was isolated in the same hospital. He was later medically evacuated to the United States of America, arriving in Atlanta on 12 March 2016. The patient has no history of travel in the 21 days prior to the onset of symptoms. He tested positive for Lassa fever by PCR on 12 March at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The patient has been under treatment since his arrival on U.S. soil. Currently, he is in stable condition in isolation. Public health response  The Ministry of Health of Togo is carrying out outbreak investigation and response activities, with the support of WHO and the U.S. CDC. Conducted activities include the review of cases under management at the affected health facility in Togo. Community mobilization and disease awareness campaigns at various levels are also ongoing. Contact tracing and follow-up are being performed. As of 18 March 2016, contacts were being monitored in Togo (n=13), Germany (n=52) and U.S. (n=1). The WHO and CDC web pages for Lassa fever have been updated and the CDC website has been translated in French.  WHO risk assessment  The affected area in Togo borders with Benin, which has been experiencing a Lassa fever outbreak since December 2015. Furthermore, intense cross-border movement of local populations is reported between the two countries. It is, therefore, not possible to exclude a spread of the outbreak from Benin to Togo.  Preliminary sequencing information indicate that the virus incriminated in Togo is a new basal lineage not related to Nigeria, a Lassa fever affected country, which would be consistent with an autochthonous infection. Further sequencing and epidemiological investigation are ongoing to confirm these findings. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessments based on the latest available information.  WHO does not recommend any restriction of travel and trade to Togo based on the information available.  CORRIGENDUM  Updated on 24 March 2016. The following sentence was removed "On 25 January 2016, the National IHR Focal Point of Benin notified WHO of an outbreak of Lassa fever". 
1001219	24 December 1996 Disease Outbreak Reported  The Ministry of Health of Gabon issued a press release on 19 December giving the latest information on the outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever and describing the measures being taken to control it.  The outbreak was originally declared on 10 October 1996, with cases occurring in the region of Booue. Measures were taken immediately to control the spread of infection both in the villages and hospitals with the assistance of a WHO team. Health personnel received training and a public information campaign was launched. It appeared initially that the outbreak was being brought under control. However, at the beginning of December another outbreak occurred in the Booue region, causing 8 deaths. Despite advice to the contrary, some contacts left the region and travelled to Lastourville, where one case was admitted to hospital, and to Libreville where two cases have died during the past week. These cases in Libreville were children who accompanied their father to attend the burial ceremony of a deceased Ebola patient in Booue.  The Ministry of Health has made every effort to trace all persons who have been in contact with Ebola patients and to instruct the public on the imperative need to cooperate with the control efforts organized by the government. The Ministry is now satisfied that all contacts have been traced and placed under medical supervision. Seminars and training courses are being held for all personnel involved in the control operation, for which attendance is obligatory.  In Booue district, to date there have now been approximately 40 cases with 30 deaths since the start of the epidemic. 9 cases are presently convalescing. In the past few days there have been 4 new cases with 1 death on 23 December.  The Ministry of Health and WHO are holding a press conference in Libreville today at 16h00 local time. The press conference will be open to all interested journalists and is being held to provide full information to the public about the outbreak and the measures being taken to end it, and to reassure the public that the situation is fully under control. 
1001220	Disease outbreak news  8 April 2014 - On 4 April 2014, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of 3 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.  Details of the cases reported to WHO are as follows: A 30 year-old man from Tongling City, Anhui province. He became ill on 23 March and was admitted to hospital on 29 March. He is currently in a critical condition. A 37 year-old man from Shenzen City, Guangdong province. He became ill on 25 March and was admitted to hospital on 1 April. He is currently in a stable condition. The patient has a history of exposure to poultry. A 62 year-old man from Heyuan City, Guangdong province. He became ill on 23 March and was admitted to hospital on 30 March. He is currently in a critical condition. He has a history of exposure to poultry.  The Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures:  strengthen surveillance and situation analysis; reinforce case management and treatment; and conduct risk communication with the public and release information. Current risk assessment  The overall risk assessment has not changed (see WHO Risk Assessment under 'Related links').  The previous report of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus detection in live poultry exported from mainland China to Hong Kong SAR shows the potential for the virus to spread through movement of live poultry, at this time there is no indication that international spread of avian influenza A(H7N9) has occurred. However as the virus infection does not cause signs of disease in poultry, continued surveillance is needed.  Further sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection are expected in affected and possibly neighbouring areas.  Should human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is unlikely as the virus does not have the ability to transmit easily among humans. Until the virus adapts itself for efficient human-to-human transmission, the risk of ongoing international spread of H7N9 virus by travellers is low.  WHO advice  WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.  WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions.  As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.  WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions. 
1001221	29 April 2005  As of 27 April, the Ministry of Health in Angola has reported 275 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever. Of these cases, 255 were fatal. In Uige Province, which remains the epicentre of the outbreak, 266 cases, of which 246 have been fatal, were reported as of 28 April.  With all control measures – teams, equipment, and protocols – needed to contain the outbreak now in place, extreme care must be taken to guard against any practices that could again amplify transmission. At this point in the outbreak, an amplification event would be a setback capable of extending the presently intense containment efforts for several weeks. During past outbreaks of viral haemorrhagic fevers, such events have historically resulted in an additional two transmission cycles and a second wave of cases.  Control operations in Uige have experienced some recent setbacks. On two occasions earlier this week, doctors at Uige’s large provincial hospital were directly exposed to blood from Marburg patients being treated on general wards, without adequate infection control. The doctors are under observation. These high-risk exposures should not have occurred.  Such incidents indicate that infection control procedures at the hospital have been seriously compromised. They occurred despite a system put in place, and supported by equipment and training, to safely screen new admissions for exposure history and fever and ensure the separation of possible cases from patients on the general wards.  In another recent incident, the body of a deceased patient was left, uncleaned and uncollected, on an open ward for more than eight hours, placing hospital staff and other patients at risk. In another incident, a severely ill baby admitted to the paediatric ward was placed in a cot, without disinfection, immediately after the body of another baby, who died from the disease, had been removed. In line with cultural practices, mothers are present on the paediatric ward and share the care of severely ill children, thus also sharing the exposure risk.  Under such conditions, amplification of transmission is highly likely to occur. Had safety protocols, set in place by the international team, been followed, none of these incidents would have occurred. Closing of the hospital has been considered but is not a viable option. Such a step would deprive many patients of potentially life-saving care while re-directing others to private clinics, where conditions and practices are even more unsafe and even more likely to result in additional cases.  Yesterday, the Minister of Health, accompanied by a vice-minister and the head of the WHO office in Angola, flew to Uige to investigate the situation, find solutions, and oversee their implementation. The officials have recognized that strong measures will be needed to ensure that patients admitted to the hospital for other conditions are not placed at risk of Marburg infection. The first steps to correct the situation were put in place today, and involve the collaboration of ministry officials, WHO, and Médecins Sans Frontières.  WHO has decided to strengthen the presence in Uige of international staff specialized in infection control. WHO welcomes the direct intervention of ministry officials. This high-level support should help ensure that containment measures, previously set in place and of proven efficacy, are restored and fully adhered to.  Investigation of several recent fatalities in Uige indicates a clear link between home-based treatments using unsafe syringes and spread of the virus. This problem is being addressed urgently. A massive door-to-door campaign, supported by banners and posters throughout Uige municipality, was launched yesterday to inform residents of the associated dangers and collect and safely destroy syringes. The campaign has continued today. 
1001222	 27 August 2015  Between 22 and 23 August 2015, the National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia notified WHO of 13 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Twelve (12) of these reported cases are associated with a MERS-CoV outbreak currently occurring in a hospital in Riyadh city.

The patient visited a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case (see DON published on 21 August – case no. 12) at the hospital that has been experiencing a MERS-CoV outbreak. He has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. A 41-year-old male from Riyadh city developed symptoms on 19 August and, on 20 August, was admitted to hospital. The patient, who has no comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on 21 August. Currently, he is in stable condition in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward. The patient visited a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case (see DON published on 21 August – case no. 12) at the hospital that has been experiencing a MERS-CoV outbreak. He has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. A 57-year-old female from Riyadh city developed symptoms on 17 August and, on the same day, was admitted to hospital. The patient, who has comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on 19 August. Currently, she is in stable condition in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward. The patient is a contact of two laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases (see DON published on 26 August – case no. 27; see DON published on 12 August – case no. 14). A 63-year-old male from Riyadh city developed symptoms on 19 August and, on the same day, was admitted to hospital. The patient, who has comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on 21 August. Currently, he is in stable condition in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward. Investigation of history of exposure to known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing.  Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases.  The National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia also notified WHO of the death of 1 MERS-CoV case that was reported in a previous DON on 26 August (case no. 19).  Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1,474 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 515 related deaths.  WHO advice  Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.  Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.  Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.  Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.  WHO remains vigilant and is monitoring the situation. Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. Raising awareness about MERS-CoV among travellers to and from affected countries is good public health practice.  Public health authorities in host countries preparing for mass gatherings should ensure that all recommendations and guidance issued by WHO with respect to MERS-CoV have been appropriately taken into consideration and made accessible to all concerned officials. Public health authorities should plan for surge capacity to ensure that visitors during the mass gathering can be accommodated by health systems. 
1001223	29 March 2006  The Ministry of Health in Egypt has confirmed the country’s second fatal case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus.  The death occurred in a 30-year-old woman from the Qaliubiya governorate near Cairo. She developed symptoms on 12 March following the home slaughter of chickens. She was hospitalized on 16 March and died on 27 March.  The country’s first case, previously reported, occurred in a 30-year-old woman, also from Qaliubiya, who died on 17 March.  Tests conducted by the Cairo-based US Naval Medical Research Unit 3 (NAMRU-3) have confirmed an additional three cases.  A 32-year-old man, who worked on a farm where poultry were recently culled, developed symptoms on 16 March and was hospitalized the same day. He has since recovered.  A 17-year-old boy, whose father runs a poultry farm in the Gharbiya governorate in the Nile Delta, developed symptoms on 18 March and was hospitalized the following day. He has since recovered.  The fifth case is an 18-year-old girl from the Kafr El-Sheikh governorate. She developed symptoms following the slaughter of sick backyard poultry. She was hospitalized on 25 March.  At present, the Ministry of Health has confirmed all five cases based on results from the NAMRU-3 laboratory. Samples from these cases have been sent to a WHO collaborating laboratory in the United Kingdom for diagnostic verification. WHO will adjust the figures in its cumulative number of cases following the results of this external verification. Test results are expected later this week.  Health authorities have screened more than 350 people who were contacts of these patients or had a recent history of exposure to diseased birds. All test results have been negative for H5N1 infection.  Egypt has a large population of poultry, many of which are kept on roof terraces in close proximity to humans. H5N1 outbreaks in poultry have now been reported in 19 of the country’s 26 governorates. Since the first outbreak was confirmed on 17 February, more than 25 million birds have died or been destroyed. 
1001224	On 7 February 2020, the Chile IHR National Focal Point informed the Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) of the detection of three confirmed cases of autochthonous dengue fever reported on Easter Island. The cases were diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on 6 February and microbiological characterization identified the cases as serotype 2 (DENV 2 by PCR). Laboratory confirmation was performed at the national reference laboratory of the Chile Institute of Public Health on 6 February 2020.  These are the first confirmed cases of dengue due to DENV 2 reported on Easter Island in 2020. The cases are females with ages ranging from 27 to 49 years. The dates of symptom onset were between 27 January to 6 February 2020. None of the cases reported any travel history.  In 2000, the presence of the vector, A. aegypti, was confirmed on Easter Island. The first dengue outbreak was reported in 2002 and was due to DENV 1. In 2009, two autochthonous DENV 4 cases were detected and in 2016, 2017 and 2018, cases due to DENV 1 were reported (33, 2 and 18 cases, respectively). In 2019, a total of 38 dengue cases were reported on Easter Island (28 autochthonous DENV 1 cases, nine imported cases from Tahiti (four DENV 1 and five DENV 2 cases), and one probable autochthonous DENV 1 case). No severe dengue cases were reported in 2019.  Since 2009, no other serotypes besides DENV 1 have been identified in autochthonous cases until the beginning of 2020.  The density of competent vectors on Easter Island could potentially contribute to the spread of the disease throughout the island.     Public health response  Actions implemented by local public health authorities are as follows:  Strengthening active and passive epidemiological surveillance, including syndromic surveillance. Strengthening and intensifying vector surveillance and control. Providing training to healthcare professionals on early detection of warning signs of severe disease and appropriate clinical management of patients with dengue. Implementing a risk communication strategy for local awareness.     WHO risk assessment  Dengue fever is a febrile illness that affects infants, young children, and adults, with symptoms ranging from mild fever to high fever, with headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, and rash. It is transmitted by the bite of a mosquito infected with one of the four dengue virus serotypes.  The introduction of serotype DENV 2 into this population, majority of which already have primary infection with DENV 1, can pose a potential risk for severe dengue cases due to secondary infections.  Easter Island has a subtropical climate. The average annual temperature is 20.5°C with small variations between seasons that do not usually exceed 7°C. Summer runs from 21 December to 21 March, with January and February being the warmest months with an average maximum temperature of 28°C and minimum temperature of 15°C.  Easter Island has weekly air transport connections with French Polynesia, where there is an ongoing dengue outbreak with predominantly DENV 2. Additionally, due to the presence of the competent vector and, given that Easter Island is a popular tourist destination, the risk of spread to neighboring islands and countries cannot be ruled out.     WHO advice  In light of the increase in dengue cases and possible severe dengue cases in several countries and territories of the Region of the Americas especially in 2019, PAHO/WHO encourages Member States to follow the key recommendations regarding outbreak preparedness and response, case management, laboratory, and integrated vector management (IVM) as published in the 21 November 2018 PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Alert on Dengue and the 11 November 2019 PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update on Dengue.  There is no specific treatment for dengue; however, the timely detection of cases, identifying any warning signs of severe dengue, and appropriate case management are key elements of care to prevent patient deaths due to dengue. A delay in seeking medical care in severe dengue cases is often related to deaths from dengue virus disease.  Additionally, IVM activities should be enhanced to remove potential breeding sites, reduce vector populations, and minimize individual exposure. This should include both larval and adult vector control strategies (i.e. environmental management and source reduction and chemical control measures). Vector control measures should be implemented at households, places of work, schools, and healthcare facilities, among others, to prevent the vector-person contact.  Given that Aedes mosquitoes, the competent vector, have greater activity during the day, personal protection measures are recommended such as the use of protective clothing that minimizes skin exposure and repellents that can be applied to exposed skin or clothes; the use of repellents must be in strict accordance with the label instructions. Window and door screens, and mosquito nets (impregnated or not with insecticide), can be useful to reduce the vector-person contact in closed spaces during the day or night. Community supported source reduction measures should be initiated, and vector surveillance and control implemented.

1001225	 8 May 2015  On 1 May 2015, the National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia notified WHO of 1 additional case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.  Details of the case are as follows:  A 35-year-old male from Khamis Mushait city developed symptoms on 27 April and was admitted to hospital on 29 April. The patient has comorbidities. He has no history of direct contact with camels or consumption of raw camel products; however, his house is adjacent to a camel market. The patient has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Currently, he is in critical condition in ICU. Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for this case.  Globally, WHO has been notified of 1111 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 422 related deaths.  WHO advice  Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

1001226	27 January 2009 - The Ministry of Health in China has announced three new confirmed human cases of H5N1 infection. The first, a 31-year-old female from Urumqi, Xinjiang Autonomous Region had onset of symptoms on 10 January. She received treatment in hospital but died on 23 January. Investigations into the possible source of her infection indicate recent visits to a live poultry market. The local authorities are currently conducting epidemiological investigations and close contacts are being monitored. To date, no clinical symptoms have been reported among the contacts.  The second case is a 29-year-old male from Guiyang city, Guizhou. He had onset of symptoms on 15 January and remains in a critical condition. Investigations into the source of his infection indicate possible exposure at poultry market.  The third case is an 18-year-old male from Beiliu City, Guangxi Province. He had onset of symptoms on 19 January and died on 26 January. Investigations into the source of his infection indicate a recent history of exposure to sick and dead poultry. Close contacts of the case are being monitored and to date all remain well.  Of the 37 cases confirmed to date in China, 25 have been fatal. 
1001227	 14 July 2014  On 3, 5, 6, 8 and 10 July 2014, the National IHR Focal Point for Saudi Arabia reported an additional 7 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the death of a previously reported case.

1001228	The outbreak was identified when suspected measles cases had been reported by the local residents in the surrounding areas, highlighting pockets of under-vaccinated populations. According to WHO/UNICEF 2018 estimates, measles first dose vaccination coverage is relatively high (88%), and slightly lower for the second dose (77%). However, this does not reflect the vaccination coverage of incoming refugees.  As of 27 April 2020, 857 confirmed measles cases have been notified from four districts, including: Cibitoke (624 cases), Butezi (221 cases), Cankuzo (6 cases) and South Bujumbura (6 cases). Of the measles cases in Cibitoke, 601 cases were epidemiologically linked, 20 cases were laboratory confirmed, and three were clinically diagnosed. In Butezi district, 27 were laboratory confirmed, 192 were epidemiologically linked, and two were clinically diagnosed. In Cankuzo, all six cases were laboratory-confirmed, whereas in the district of South Bujumbura three were laboratory confirmed and three were epidemiologically linked. Children aged 9 to 59 months were the most affected age group, with 80% of cases in children aged 9 years or younger.  Table 1. Distribution of confirmed cases of measles by age and sex  No new cases have been reported in South district of Bujumbura and Cankuzo since December 2019. The last cases were reported in Butezi on 2 March 2020.  The outbreak in Cibitoke is ongoing. The last case in the Transit camp of Cishemere was reported on 14 January 2020). Globally, the total cases reported in Cishemere Transit Camp and Cibitoke health district are 67 and 557 respectively.  Measles circulation in a population with low immunity is the cause of this outbreak. The majority of cases (77%) were either unvaccinated or unsure of their vaccination status.  Public health response  The Ministry of Public Health of Burundi, with partners including WHO, UNICEF, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) and Gruppo di Volontariato Civile (GVC), have developed a comprehensive measles outbreak response plan which includes the following public health measures:  Establishment of a technical committee responsible for developing and monitoring the implementation of the plan, under the chairmanship of the Director-General of Health Services and the Fight against AIDS; Vaccination response by targeting children aged 9 months to 14 years in the camps including Cishemere transit center in Cibitoke, Nyankanda and Bwagiriza refugee camps in Butezi; and Kavumu camp of Cankuzo; Strengthening the vaccination program for children in refugee camps and affected districts with the establishment of a vaccination post at the Cishemere refugee transit camp; Strengthening surveillance in the affected health districts with an emphasis on active case finding extended to all the districts sheltering the refugee’s camps of Garsowe (Muyinga) and Mulumba (Kiremba). Resource mobilization is underway to finance the national response plan, validated by the Ministry of Public Health and Fight against AIDS; Capacity building of health care providers on case management and surveillance; With support of community health workers, active search, and vaccination of children who are not previously vaccinated with a first and second dose of measles-containing-vaccine (MCV).     WHO risk assessment  WHO estimates that the current measles epidemic represents a high risk for Burundi for the following reasons:  Increase in the number of cases reported since November 2019; The epidemic is spreading from refugee camps to the community; The lack of infrastructure, insufficient inputs and resources to ensure free care and staff capable of ensuring clinical management of complications of measles infection; Suboptimal immunization coverage- 88% for MCV 1 and 77% for MCV 2 (according to the 2018 WHO / UNICEF joint estimate); Large population movements between localities and concomitant measles epidemics in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo.  In addition to low immunity, gaps in measles-rubella surveillance in the country, confirmed by the 2019 measles risk analysis, showed that 63% of districts (29/46 health districts) were at high risk, including 13 districts at very high-risk of measles outbreak. This shows that the country's surveillance system might not be able to detect outbreaks of measles if it is not strengthened.        WHO advice  Measles is a vaccine-preventable disease and two doses of MCV are recommended to ensure immunity. Conducting targeted reactive vaccination campaigns and strengthening routine vaccination are essential for effective control of the epidemic. The administration of Vitamin A, particularly in the context of malnutrition, can reduce morbidity and mortality from measles.  WHO urges all Member States to:  Ensure routine measles vaccination for children combined with mass immunization campaigns in countries with high case and death rates to reduce deaths due to measles. Achieve and maintain at least 95% coverage with the first and second doses of MCV. Vaccinate at-risk populations, including refugees, internally displaced persons, young children, pregnant women, health workers, people working in tourism and transportation and international travellers. Strengthen epidemiological surveillance of fever and rash cases for timely detection of all suspected cases of measles in public and private healthcare facilities and ensure that samples are promptly received by laboratories. Ensure vitamin A is integrated into the response, in line with recent WHO guidelines.  WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and trade to the Burundi based on the information available on the current outbreak.

1001229	 3 June 2016  On 2 May 2016, the Ministry of Health of Peru reported 57 cases of Oropouche fever. The majority of cases are from towns located in the northern part of the Cusco Region, which is situated in the Amazon rainforest.  Most cases (79%) were detected in January, with only 7% and 14% of the cases being identified in February and March, respectively. To date, there have been no fatalities and all cases have recovered following symptomatic treatment.  In February 2016, a field mission to the Madre de Dios Region conducted jointly by the MoH of Peru and PAHO/WHO revealed a mixed outbreak of dengue (DENV-2) and Oropouche viruses. While Madre de Dios already experienced an outbreak of Oropouche fever in 1994, at the time of the mission in February, this latest outbreak was of a higher magnitude (120 confirmed cases).  Public health response  Peruvian health authorities have implemented the following public health measures:  providing medical treatment to the cases; conducting epidemiological and entomological investigations; strengthening vector control. WHO risk assessment  Cases of infection with Oropouche virus have already been reported in the past in Peru. However, it is the first time that the Cusco Region records cases of Oropouche fever. It will be critical to establish whether the competent vector, the Culicoides paraensis midge, is present in Cusco as that could provide some explanation for the emergence of the disease in this specific area. At present, the possibility of further cases being detected in the Cusco Region and in the rest of Peru cannot be excluded. Given the wide geographical distribution of the competent vector in the Region of the Americas, the risk of cases being identified in other countries is significant. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessments based on the latest available information.  WHO advice  Given its clinical presentation, Oropouche fever should be included in the clinical differential diagnosis for other common arboviral diseases (e.g., chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever, Zika virus).  The proximity of midge vector breeding to human habitation is a significant risk factor for Oropouche virus infection. Prevention and control relies on reducing the breeding of midges through source reduction (removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between midges and people. This can be achieved by reducing the number of natural and artificial water-filled habitats that support midge larvae, reducing the adult midge populations around at-risk communities and by using barriers such as insect screens, closed doors and windows, long clothing and repellents.  Background  Oropouche fever is caused by the Oropouche virus. In humans, it is transmitted primarily through the bite of the Culicoides paraensis midge. No direct transmission of the virus from human to human has been documented.  Oropouche fever causes symptoms similar to those of dengue with an incubation period of 4-8 days (range: 3-12 days). Symptoms include the sudden onset of high fever, headache, myalgia, joint pain, and vomiting. In some patients it can cause clinical symptoms of aseptic meningitis.  In the Americas, outbreaks of Oropouche fever virus have been reported from rural and urban communities of Brazil, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, and Trinidad and Tobago. 
1001230	14 January 1998 Disease Outbreak Reported  Investigation of the specimens with ELISA test at the WHO Collaborating Centre at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in Atlanta detected IgM antibody which indicates recent RVF infection in 13 of 36 cases. In addition to the 3 RVF virus isolates reported in the first week of January by the WHO Collaborating Centre at the National Institute of Virology, Johannesburg the virus has been isolated from another case tested in the first batch of 36 specimens and in 3 cases tested in a second batch which was received on 9 January. These results all concerned human cases affected by the outbreak which may have killed over 300 people and many animals in the Garissa District, North-Eastern Province, Kenya since early December. Laboratory investigations of specimens from animals are in progress in South Africa.  Access to the outbreak area has been difficult and the initial WHO investigation was unable to completely clarify the extent to which other causes have contributed to the high mortality among both humans and animals. WHO is sending a follow-on team to work with the national authorities and international agencies, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Médecins Sans Frontières, and Epicentre (Paris) to further investigate the outbreak and develop control measures. The main objectives are to coordinate activities, assess the extent of the outbreak and strengthen control measures among humans and animals and explore the feasibility of immunization of livestock. 
1001231	12 December 2012 - The Ministry of Health of the Republic of Congo is launching an emergency mass-vaccination campaign against yellow fever in Ewo District in Cuvette-Ouest region, beginning next week.  The emergency vaccination campaign aims to cover approximately 35,000 people in three health districts of Mbama, Ewo and Okoyo, all of which belong to the administrative district of Ewo.  The emergency vaccination campaign is being carried out after recent confirmation of a case with yellow fever virus infection that occurred in October 2012. The case was identified through the national surveillance programme for yellow fever.  Laboratory confirmation was done at Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale Kinshasa (INRB), and reconfirmed by a WHO regional reference laboratory for yellow fever, Institut Pasteur, Dakar, Senegal.  The vaccination campaign is being supported by the International Coordinating Group on Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG1), the GAVI Alliance and the European Commission’s Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection Department (ECHO).  1 The YF-ICG is a partnership that manages the stockpile of yellow fever vaccines for emergency response on the basis of a rotation fund. It is represented by United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and WHO, which also serves as the Secretariat. The stockpile was created by GAVI Alliance. 
1001232	18 January 2000 Disease Outbreak Reported  The 23 year old student who contracted Lassa fever while in Africa in November and December died on 15 January 2000 at the Tropical Medicine Department of the Würzburg Hospital, Germany, where she had been treated in an isolation ward. No secondary cases have been reported. As mentioned previously, risk of infection to casual contacts is considered to be minimal to since virus transmission requires contact with blood or body fluids. 
1001233	22 July 2010 - The Ministry of Health of Indonesia has announced a new case of human infection of H5N1 avian influenza. A 13-year-old female from Sukoharjo District, Central Java Province developed symptoms on 16 June, was hospitalized on 21 June and died on 24 June. Laboratory tests were positive for H5N1 virus infection. Investigations into the source of her infection indicate poultry deaths, in the neighbourhood, one week before onset of case’s symptoms.  Of the 167 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 138 have been fatal. 
1001234	20 April 2013 - As of 20 April 2013 (17:00CET), the National Health and Family Planning Commission notified WHO of an additional 5 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus. Of the latest laboratory confirmed cases, three are from Zhejiang Province, one is from Shanghai Municipality, and one is from Jiangsu Province.  The patients include:  a 75 year-old male from Shanghai Municipality who became ill on 13 April 2013; a 43 year-old male from Jiangsu Province who became ill on 7 April 2013; a 56 year- old male from Zhejiang Province who became ill on 11 April 2013; a 35 year-old female from Zhejiang Province who became ill on 14 April 2013; a 37 year-old male from Zhejiang Province who became ill on March 30 2013.  Additionally, 1 patient earlier reported from Zhejiang Province has died.  To date, there are a total of 96 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China; including 18 deaths. Contacts of the confirmed cases are being closely monitored. Currently, 69 patients are being treated in hospital and 9 patients have been discharged.  National authorities continue to implement prevention and control measures which include: strengthened epidemic monitoring and analysis and enhanced public risk communication and information dissemination.  Investigations into the possible sources of infection and reservoirs of the virus are ongoing. Until the source of infection has been identified, it is expected that there will be further cases of human infection with the virus in China. So far, there is no evidence of ongoing human-to-human transmission.  WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied.  At the invitation of the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China, WHO has convened a team of experts who will visit areas affected by avian influenza A(H7N9) in China in order to provide recommendations on the prevention and control of the disease.

1001235	27 May 2003Disease Outbreak Reported  SARS resolution approved, situation in Taiwan  World Health Assembly adopts resolution on SARSToday in Geneva, more than 190 countries participating in the World Health Assembly – the supreme governing body of WHO – unanimously approved a resolution on SARS. The Assembly also considered a report (.pdf)on the emergence and spread of SARS and on the international response to date.  The text of the resolution was based on a draft proposed by a group of Asian countries, and then fine-tuned during more than 7 hours of collaborative work by 37 nations. The group was chaired by Dr Viroj Tangcharoensathien, a senior member of Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health.  The resolution, which recognizes SARS as “the first severe infectious disease to emerge in the twenty-first century”, calls for the full support of all countries to control SARS and other emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. It also urges countries “to report cases promptly and transparently and to provide requested information to WHO.” Countries are further asked to request WHO support when “control measures employed are ineffective in halting the spread of disease.”  In the resolution and in the debate that preceded its adoption, SARS was clearly recognized as a serious threat to the stability and growth of economies, the livelihood of populations, and the functioning of health systems as well as a cause of great human suffering. Lessons learned in the ongoing response to SARS were considered relevant to improved preparedness for the next new disease, the next influenza pandemic, and a possible act of bioterrorism.  While WHO was asked to continue to update the list of areas with recent local transmission of SARS, the resolution acknowledges the need to do so in a way that minimizes the socioeconomic consequences.  A statement made by the Italian delegation, praising the dedication of all health care workers, including several who have lost their lives to SARS, met with a round of applause.  In a related item, also considered today, delegates approved a resolution setting out procedures and a timetable for revision of the International Health Regulations. The Regulations, which are administered by WHO, provide the legal framework for global surveillance and reporting of infectious diseases. They also provide the only mechanism through which measures to prevent international spread can be enforced.  Basically unchanged since 1969, the Regulations are considered grossly inadequate in protecting nations and the international community against the resurgence of the infectious disease threat, which has resulted in the emergence of around 30 new diseases during the past two decades. As many speakers noted, this threat, dramatically illustrated by SARS, is amplified by conditions in a highly mobile, interconnected, and closely interdependent world.  As the revision process will not be completed before 2005, the resolution adopted by consensus today requests WHO, through its Director-General, to take into account information about epidemics from sources other than official government notifications, and to conduct on-the-spot studies within countries to ensure that control measures are adequate to prevent international spread. These newly authorized functions are expected to strengthen WHO’s capacity to respond to outbreaks and epidemics quickly and with sufficient force to prevent spread to neighbouring countries and others.  Situation in Taiwan A WHO official in Taiwan has today reported important strides forward in strengthening hospital infection control and contact tracing. Health officials have launched a widespread information campaign, set up a major screening programme and established fever clinics to keep persons suspected of having SARS out of contact with others. In the assessment of WHO, these efforts are beginning to bear fruit. The situation in Taiwan is expected to improve gradually in the coming days and weeks.  Thirteen new probable cases and 4 new deaths were reported today from Taiwan.  Update on cases and countries As of today, a cumulative total of 8221 probable SARS cases with 735 deaths has been reported from 28 countries. This represents an increase of 24 new cases and 10 deaths compared with yesterday. The new deaths occurred in China (4), Hong Kong SAR (2), and Taiwan (4). 
1001236	Disease Outbreak Reported20 March 2003  Investigation of causative agent gains momentum Highly specialized testing of specimens from patients ill with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) continues at top speed in top labs, expedited by electronic sharing of results. WHO is increasingly optimistic that conclusive identification of the causative agent can be announced soon. The development of a precise diagnostic test could follow quickly. Collaboration in the race to find the causative agent is taking place within the framework of a network of labs set up on Monday. Research is now focused on the Paramyxoviridae family of viruses. This family includes several well-known viruses, such as those causing mumps, measles and common respiratory ailments. It also includes a subfamily of viruses capable of infecting multiple animal species, including humans. This subfamily was implicated in the emergence during the 1990s of new and severe diseases in humans caused by Hendra and Nipah viruses. The virus jumped directly from animal hosts (horses and pigs) to humans. No person-to-person transmission was documented in outbreaks caused by either virus. New treatment network WHO has today established a cooperative network of clinicians for SARS diagnosis and treatment. The network brings together, via two daily teleconferences, clinicians in the most heavily affected Asian countries and in Europe and North America. Clinicians participate on the basis of either first-hand experience in the management of SARS cases or leading expertise in the diagnosis and management of unusual infectious diseases. Participants are pooling data on cases and sharing X-ray pictures. Chest X-rays are, at present, one of the main tools for distinguishing between suspected and probable cases. Treatment guidelines, including criteria for safe discharge of patients from hospitals, are also being established on the basis of shared experiences. Pending definitive identification of the causative agent, a combination of treatments are being tried to cure cases. WHO is providing support, in the form of protective equipment and supplies, to help the most heavily affected hospitals prevent further spread within hospital settings, where the overwhelming majority of new infections have occurred. If a paramyxovirus is confirmed to be the cause, WHO will be in a much better position to recommend a treatment. The antiviral drug, ribavirin, may be responsible for some degree of clinical improvement observed in critically ill patients in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China. Intensive and good supportive care have also been associated with improved prospects of recovery.Update on cases and affected countries As of 20 March, 306 suspected and probable cases, including 10 deaths, have been reported from eleven countries. These figures represent an additional 42 cases and one death compared with the previous day. Increases were reported in Canada (1), Hong Kong (23), Singapore (3), Taiwan, China (1), the United Kingdom (1), and Viet Nam (6). Switzerland, reporting 7 suspected cases, was added to the list.Possible cases in airline passengers and crew member ruled out Press reports have referred to 2 suspected cases of SARS, one in an airline crew member and a second in a passenger, travelling on separate flights from Hong Kong and Taipei to Viet Nam. Both suspected cases have been investigated and are now ruled out as cases of SARS. Index case in Hong Kong outbreak WHO has welcomed a report from the Hong Kong Department of Health, released yesterday, that may have identified the “index” case in the outbreak in the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong. In an outstanding example of detective work, epidemiologists have determined that 7 people who contracted SARS recently stayed in or visited the Metropole hotel in Kowloon last month. The 7 persons investigated include 3 visitors from Singapore, 2 from Canada, one China Mainland visitor, and a local Hong Kong resident. The investigation revealed that all 7 stayed in or visited the same floor of the hotel between 12 February and 2 March. The local Hong Kong resident is believed to be the index case, who subsequently infected other early cases in the outbreak. He had visited an acquaintance staying at the hotel from 15 to 23 February. The visitor from Mainland China, who became sick a week before staying at the hotel, is considered the original source of the infection. No further cases have been linked to the hotel. Absolute need for continued vigilance WHO is underscoring the need for continued vigilance. Experience with other emerging diseases makes it clear that, should the causative agent turn out to be a virus, the new disease could establish endemicity, especially in light of abundantly documented human-to-human transmission. The world must protect itself against the widespread establishment of another new infectious disease. WHO concern is now increasingly focused on preparation to assist vulnerable countries in the likely event that cases continue to spread. Up to now, all imported cases have occurred in countries well-equipped and well-prepared to institute WHO-recommended precautions, including isolation and barrier nursing practices, for preventing spread to others, whether health care workers or family members. In view of the rapid spread of this disease to new countries via exposed air travellers, any country with an international airport is potentially at risk. This focus on preparedness underscores the need for a concerted effort to defend global public health security. In an era of close interconnectedness and rapid air travel, an outbreak anywhere in the world is a potential threat to health everywhere. International collaboration – on the part of the medical and research communities, multinational teams in the field, and health authorities around the world – in the reporting, investigation, and management of this outbreak has been outstanding. 
1001237	2 April 2003 Disease Outbreak Reported  SARS outbreak:WHO investigation team moves to China, new travel advice announced [WHO PRESS RELEASE]  PRESS RELEASE ISSUED BY WHO2 April 2003  The World Health Organization (WHO) today said that the Government of China had announced the WHO expert team currently in Beijing will travel to Guangdong Province to investigate the SARS outbreak there.  “These are very positive steps taken today by China,” said Dr David Heymann, Executive Director of Communicable Diseases at WHO. “As a result we’ll be able to gather even more evidence about the nature of the SARS outbreak in China.”  In addition, WHO began recommending that persons travelling to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Guangdong Province, China consider postponing all but essential travel. This updated travel advice comes as a result of new developments, particularly in Hong Kong, in the multi-country outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).  This temporary recommendation will be reassessed daily as the epidemic evolves. The recommendation does not apply to passengers simply transiting through airports in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region or Guangdong Province, China.  The new travel advisory is intended to limit the spread of SARS by reducing travel to high risk areas. All other elements ofSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) WHO previous travel guidance still stand. See Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).  The SARS situation in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China has developed unique features. There is a continuing and significant increase in cases* with indications that SARS has spread beyond the initial focus in hospitals. These developments raise questions related to other possible routes of transmission of SARS. These may involve transport of the virus from one person to another via some type of environmental means. To date, no satisfactory explanation has been found regarding this possibility. Also, since March 19, nine travellers have been identified as SARS cases on returning from a visit to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China.  Many questions about the state of the outbreak in Guangdong Province, China which borders Hong Kong have yet to be answered. The Guangdong outbreak is the largest reported and has also shown evidence of spread in the wider community. New information provided today by provincial authorities of more than 300 new cases in March alone indicates the outbreak there continues.  Unprecedented global cooperation helps advance knowledge and containment of SARS  In the four weeks that WHO has been tracking SARS much has been learned. This is largely because scientists, clinicians, laboratory chiefs and public health officials everywhere have collaborated closely.  As a result of WHO's global alert issued on 15 March, national authorities have implemented heightened surveillance for cases of SARS. While an increasing number of countries are reporting new cases, these cases are quickly identified, patients are isolated and local transmission is stopped in most countries.  It is now known that infection control methods work to contain the spread of SARS in hospitals, even in countries which do not have the most modern equipment.  WHO and a network of 11 of the world's top laboratories are zeroing in on the cause of SARS and a diagnostic test is being developed. This test will help distinguish between those who are infected and those who are free of the SARS virus.  The laboratory network is continuing its investigations. So far, the agent causing SARS has not been fully characterized and there is no certain treatment, vaccine or known other preventative measure.  "There will be other new diseases that will emerge in the future, and we will respond just as we have with SARS — with maximum efforts to contain its spread," stated Dr Guénaël Rodier, Director, Communicable Disease Surveillance and Response, WHO.  * Cases of SARS and the countries in which they appear are posted on the WHO web site every evening in Geneva. 
1001238	15 April 1998 Disease Outbreak Reported  Malaysia recorded 19,544 dengue cases in 1997, 37.4% higher than the number reported in 1996 and the highest recorded since the disease was made notifiable in the country in 1973. Of the 19,544 cases, 806 were dengue haemorrhagic fever with 50 deaths. Cases were reported throughout the year but peaked in July. Although all the states in the country were affected, most cases were reported in urban areas with high population density.  Of the 5,433 specimens submitted to the WHO Collaborating Centre for Arbovirus Reference and Research in Kuala Lumpur, for laboratory confirmation 56.5% were positive serologically. The male:female ratio was 1.28:1 and the 21-25 years age group was the most affected. Of the 100 virus strains isolated, 64 were dengue 1, 33 were dengue 2 and 3 were dengue 3.  The WHO Centre is intensifying its surveillance in 1998 since several factors may affect disease patterns. The prolonged drought caused by El Nino may affect vector density and the economic downturn has caused a reduction in massive construction which previously was associated with dengue outbreaks. Hopefully, the reduction in the health budget will not adversely affect the dengue situation.  Dengue endemic countries in South-East Asia which share problems similar to those of Malaysia are advised to monitor the situation closely and submit country data to the WHO Regional Offices in Manila and New Delhi on a regular basis.  Based on a report from the WHO Collaborating Centre for Arbovirus Reference and Research, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The Centre offers to provide its 1997 Annual Report to those interested and to collaborate in dengue surveillance affected by adverse weather patterns and economic factors. 
1001239	 23 December 2016  On 20 December 2016, the Department of Health (DOH), Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) notified WHO of a case of laboratory-confirmed human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.  Details of the case  The case is a 75-year-old man who travelled to Dongguan, Guangdong province from 28 November to 9 December 2016. He developed chest discomfort on 8 December and he visited a hospital there. He returned to Hong Kong SAR on 9 December and was directly admitted to hospital from point of entry by ambulance for cough with sputum, shortness of breath, runny nose and chest discomfort.  His nasopharyngeal swab taken on 9 December tested positive for enterovirus/ rhinovirus and negative for influenza virus. His nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) taken on 19 December was positive for avian influenza A(H7N9) virus RNA. He was reported to be in severe condition at the time of report. His condition further deteriorated to critical on 21 December. He had visited a wet market in Dongguan and bought a dressed chicken. DOH's investigation is ongoing, and DOH is communicating with the Guangdong health authority.  To date, a total of 808 laboratory-confirmed human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported through IHR notification since early 2013.  Public health response  The Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health has taken the following measures:  Urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel. Issued an alert to doctors, hospitals, schools and institutions of the latest situation. WHO risk assessment  Most human cases are exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, further human cases can be expected. Although small clusters of human cases with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported including those involving healthcare workers, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore further community level spread is considered unlikely.  Human infections with the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus are unusual and need to be monitored closely in order to identify changes in the virus and/or its transmission behaviour to humans as it may have a serious public health impact.  WHO advice  WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid, if possible, poultry farms, contact with animals in live bird markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water, and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.  WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling in or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.  WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions. 
1001240	 5 April 2017  On 31 March 2017, the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China (NHFPC) notified WHO of 17 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in mainland China.  Details of the cases  Onset dates ranged from 6 March to 24 March 2017. Of these 17 cases, three were female. The median age is 53 years old (age range among the cases is 35 to 81 years old). The cases were reported from Fujian (2), Guangxi (3), Guizhou (2), Hunan (6), Jiangsu (3) and Zhejiang (1).  At the time of notification, there were three deaths, and 14 cases were diagnosed as either pneumonia (4) or severe pneumonia (10). Sixteen cases were reported to have had exposure to poultry or live poultry market. One case had no poultry exposure history. No clusters were reported.  To date, a total of 1364 laboratory-confirmed human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported through IHR notification since early 2013.  Public health response  Considering the increase in the number of human cases since December 2016, the Chinese government at national and local levels is taking further measures including:  Continuing to strengthen control measures with a focus on hygienic management of live poultry markets and cross-regional transportation. Requiring all provinces to stay vigilant and to fully implement control and preventive measures. Increasing attention and guidance to certain central and western provinces that are reporting more cases to strengthen control and prevention. Conducting public risk communication and information publicity to provide the public with guidance on self-protection. Strengthening trace-back investigations and etiology surveillance to define the scope of virus pollution and mutations, in order to provide further guidance for prevention and control. WHO risk assessment  The number of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) in the fifth epidemic wave (i.e. onset since 1 October 2016) is greater than the numbers of human cases reported in earlier waves.  Human infections with the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus remain unusual. Close observation of the epidemiological situation and further characterization of the most recent human viruses are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner.  Most human cases are exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, and live poultry vending continues, further human cases can be expected. Although small clusters of cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported including those involving patients in the same ward, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore the likelihood of further community level spread is considered low.  WHO advice  WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid, if possible, poultry farms, contact with animals in live poultry markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water, and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.  WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling in or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.  WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR 2005, and continue national health preparedness actions. 
1001241	 27 December 2018  Pakistan Health Authorities have reported an ongoing outbreak of extensively drug resistant (XDR) typhoid fever that began in the Hyderabad district of Sindh province in November 2016. An increasing trend of typhoid fever cases caused by antimicrobial resistant (AMR) strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (or S. Typhi) poses a notable public health concern. In May 2018, the case definitions for non-resistant, multi-drug resistant (MDR) and XDR typhoid fever were formally agreed by the Regional Disease Surveillance and Response Unit (RDSRU) in Karachi, following a review by an expert group of epidemiologists, clinicians and microbiologists from Pakistan. All typhoid fever cases reported from 2016 to 2018 were reviewed and classified according to these case definitions (see Table 1).  Table 1. Classification of Typhoid Fever Cases by Drug Resistance Status, Pakistan, 2018  From 1 November 2016 through 9 December 2018, 5 274 cases of XDR typhoid out of 8 188 typhoid fever cases were reported by the Provincial Disease Surveillance and Response Unit (PDSRU) in Sindh province, Pakistan. Sixty-nine percent of cases were reported in Karachi (the capital city), 27% in Hyderabad district, and 4% in other districts in the province (Table 2). The circulating XDR strain of S. Typhi haplotype 58 was resistant to first and second-line antibiotics as well as third generation cephalosporins. Informal reports of XDR typhoid cases occurring in other parts of Pakistan were made and required further verification.  Table 2. Distribution of reported XDR typhoid fever cases in Sindh Province, Pakistan [1 November 2016 through 9 December 2018]  In addition, from January to October 2018, there were reports indicating international transmission of the XDR typhoid strain through persons who had travelled to Pakistan. Six travel-associated cases of XDR typhoid were reported; one in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and five in the United States of America. Four of the travel-associated cases had visited or resided in Karachi (Sindh province), Lahore (Punjab province) and/or Islamabad in Pakistan. Details regarding these four cases are as follows:  Two of the cases travelled to Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad. One case travelled only to Karachi. One case pending confirmation, is a resident from Lahore with travel history to the US where he/she was diagnosed and treated. The case has since returned to Pakistan.  Limited information is available about their mechanism of exposure or the exact date of onset of illness for these cases but, there are evidence that all the travel-associated cases were successfully treated.  Public health response  In January 2017, the Government of Pakistan initiated a public health response to the increasing number of XDR typhoid fever cases in Sindh province. The resulting activities included:  Community and school awareness campaigns on safe hygiene and sanitation practices were carried out in Hyderabad, including specific health education on hand hygiene, use of safe drinking water, and environmental sanitation. Water purification and sanitation activities were implemented, including distribution of chlorine tablets to affected communities in Hyderabad. General practitioners and clinicians in Hyderabad were sensitized on the rational use of antimicrobials for typhoid fever by the Department of Health and partners, with support from the WHO. A typhoid vaccination campaign was commenced on 5 August 2017 in Hyderabad with Vi-polysaccharide typhoid vaccine (ViPS). Approximately 6000 children aged 6 months to 10 years, were vaccinated. A subsequent mass vaccination campaign with typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV) was launched in Hyderabad in January 2018, resulting in approximately 118 000 children, aged 6 months to 10 years being vaccinated to date. The government of Pakistan also applied for GAVI support for a three-year phased TCV introduction into the routine National Program on Immunization, starting from 2019. Prior to the introduction, phased catch-up campaigns in urban areas will be conducted. The target age group for this activity is children aged 9 months to 15 years. XDR National Taskforce was established in July 2018, and a joint WHO and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) mission was founded. Recommendations these collaborations are currently being translated into a draft national action plan in Pakistan. Updated surveillance tools and a line listing template for data collection on typhoid cases were shared with all the provincial departments of health on 7 September 2018. The purpose of this was to collect additional information and enhance surveillance, particularly about the occurrence and spread of XDR typhoid to other parts of Pakistan, and beyond.  WHO has been leading initiatives to make a sustained difference in the continuing problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). These initiatives include:  The Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS): A standardized approach to the collection, analysis and sharing of data related to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), including reports of emerging resistance via GLASS-EAR (Emerging Antimicrobial Resistance). The purpose of this activity was to inform decision-making and drive local, national and regional action. WHO supported the XDR National Task Force in Pakistan, chaired by the Director-General of Health, in the development of the National Action Plan on AMR1. Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (GARDP): A joint initiative of WHO and Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) which encourages public-private research partnerships, including on typhoid fever. WHO risk assessment  The risk of XDR S. Typhi at the national level is considered high in Pakistan due to insufficient water, poor sanitation and hygiene (WASH) practices, low vaccination coverage and limited surveillance for typhoid fever. The fact that AMR S. Typhi confirmatory testing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing is only conducted by major laboratories and tertiary care hospitals are other priority considerations in terms of risk. These factors, coupled with sub-optimal antibiotic prescribing practices, have limited the ability to track the occurrence, spread, and containment of XDR S. Typhi.  Outbreaks of MDR typhoid and sporadic cases of infection with ceftriaxone-resistant S. Typhi have been reported in several countries. However, this is the first time a large outbreak caused by XDR S. Typhi has been observed in Pakistan.  The risk at regional level is considered moderate due to the similar environments and approaches to treatment of typhoid fever, as well as the widespread over-use of anti-microbials which is compounded by considerable levels of migration within the region.  Globally, the risk is considered low due to the availability of antimicrobials and rational prescribing practices. However, S. Typhi has a global distribution and the potential for travelers to spread this resistant clone, especially in countries with poor WASH infrastructure, cannot be eliminated. The high level of resistance to traditional first-line antibiotics in the H58 clonal strain identified to be circulating in parts of Pakistan increases the potential risk at all three levels.  WHO recommendations  This outbreak highlights the importance of public health measures to prevent the spread of resistant and non-resistant pathogens. While the emerging resistance in S. Typhi complicates treatment, typhoid fever remains common in places with poor sanitation and a lack of safe drinking water. Access to safe water and adequate sanitation, hygiene among food handlers, and typhoid vaccination are the main and most important recommendations.  WHO recommends typhoid vaccination in response to confirmed outbreaks of typhoid fever, and travelers to typhoid-endemic areas should consider vaccination. Further, where the TCV is licensed, WHO recommends TCV as the preferred typhoid vaccine. Typhoid vaccination should be implemented in combination with other efforts to control the disease.  In view of the observed capacity for S. Typhi to quickly acquire new resistance mechanisms, WHO recommends strengthening surveillance of typhoid fever, including surveillance of AMR to monitor known resistance, detect new and emerging resistance, and mitigate its spread. WHO also recommends that surveillance data is shared locally and internationally in a timely manner.  Currently, azithromycin is the only remaining reliable and affordable first-line oral therapeutic option to manage patients with XDR typhoid in low-resource settings. Patients with suspected typhoid fever should be tested microbiologically to detect S. Typhi and define antimicrobial susceptibility wherever possible to inform patient management and contribute to the surveillance efforts. Verification and advanced testing (including molecular methods) of S. Typhi strains with unusual resistance should be performed by designated expert laboratories that provide confirmatory testing, where such capacity exists within countries. In countries where no laboratory capacity currently exists, regional collaboration may be an option, whereby a neighbouring country’s reference laboratory or a WHO Collaborating Center can fulfill this role.

1001242	6 January 2004 Disease Outbreak Reported  As of 24 December, 2003, the Ministry of Health of the Republic of the Congo reported a total of 35 cases including 29 deaths of Ebola haemorrhagic fever (EHF) in Mbomo (31 cases, 25 deaths) and Mbandza (4 cases, 4 deaths) villages located in Mbomo district, Cuvette Ouest Department. The last death was reported on 3 December and no further cases have been reported since then. (see previous report)  Laboratory testing carried out by the Institut de Recherche pour le Développement (IRD) and the Centre International de Recherches Médicales de Franceville (CIRMF), Gabon has confirmed the diagnosis of Ebola in clinical samples from 16 patients. Laboratory testing was carried out in the field in collaboration with the Institute of Microbiology of Munich, Germany, the Laboratory Centre for Disease Control (LCDC) of Winnipeg, Canada and CIRMF.  The WHO Country Office supported the National Control Committee which includes the Ministries of Defence and Foresty and other partners: the European Union Humanitarian Office (ECHO), French Cooperation, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and the National Red Cross Society, Médecins sans Frontières (MSF)-Holland and United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR). Intensive social mobilization activities were carried out by the Ministry of Health and WHO, with specific health education meetings for women held in Mbomo, Olloba and Mbandza villages. 
1001243	24 April 2009 - The United States Government has reported seven confirmed human cases of Swine Influenza A/H1N1 in the USA (five in California and two in Texas) and nine suspect cases. All seven confirmed cases had mild Influenza-Like Illness (ILI), with only one requiring brief hospitalization. No deaths have been reported.  The Government of Mexico has reported three separate events. In the Federal District of Mexico, surveillance began picking up cases of ILI starting 18 March. The number of cases has risen steadily through April and as of 23 April there are now more than 854 cases of pneumonia from the capital. Of those, 59 have died. In San Luis Potosi, in central Mexico, 24 cases of ILI, with three deaths, have been reported. And from Mexicali, near the border with the United States, four cases of ILI, with no deaths, have been reported.  Of the Mexican cases, 18 have been laboratory confirmed in Canada as Swine Influenza A/H1N1, while 12 of those are genetically identical to the Swine Influenza A/H1N1 viruses from California.  The majority of these cases have occurred in otherwise healthy young adults. Influenza normally affects the very young and the very old, but these age groups have not been heavily affected in Mexico.  Because there are human cases associated with an animal influenza virus, and because of the geographical spread of multiple community outbreaks, plus the somewhat unusual age groups affected, these events are of high concern.  The Swine Influenza A/H1N1 viruses characterized in this outbreak have not been previously detected in pigs or humans. The viruses so far characterized have been sensitive to oseltamivir, but resistant to both amantadine and rimantadine.  The World Health Organization has been in constant contact with the health authorities in the United States, Mexico and Canada in order to better understand the risk which these ILI events pose. WHO (and PAHO) is sending missions of experts to Mexico to work with health authorities there. It is helping its Member States to increase field epidemiology activities, laboratory diagnosis and clinical management. Moreover, WHO's partners in the Global Alert and Response Network have been alerted and are ready to assist as requested by the Member States.  WHO acknowledges the United States and Mexico for their proactive reporting and their collaboration with WHO and will continue to work with Member States to further characterize the outbreak. 
1001244	 17 December 2014  Between 20 November and 7 December 2014, the National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) notified WHO of 11 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including 4 deaths.  Details of the cases are as follows:  1. A 70-year-old female from Taif city who developed symptoms on 27 November. She was admitted to hospital on 2 December. She had no history of contact with camels but her household contacts had frequent contact with animals.

A 28-year-old, non-national male from Najran city who developed symptoms on 27 November. He was admitted to hospital on 30 November. The patient has no comorbidities but has frequent contact with animals. He lives in an area with heavy presence of camels, although he has no history of contact with them. The patient had no exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Currently, he is in critical condition in ICU.  5. A 62-year-old male from Rafha city who developed symptoms on 22 November. He was admitted to hospital on 25 November. The patient has no comorbidities but has frequent contact with camels and sheep and consumes their products. The patient had no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Currently, he is in stable condition in an isolation ward.  6. A 34-year-old, non-national male from Skaka city who developed symptoms on 18 November. He was admitted to hospital on 23 November. The patient has no comorbidities but is a contact of a previously-reported MERS-CoV case. The patient has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Currently, he is in stable condition in ICU.  7. A 40-year-old male from Taif city who developed symptoms on 26 November. He was admitted to hospital on 27 November. The patient has no comorbidities and has no history of exposure to known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. The patient works in a health care facility, although the facility has not treated laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases. Currently, the patient is in stable condition in an isolation ward.  8. A 79-year-old, female from Alkharj city who developed symptoms on 20 November. The patient was admitted to hospital on 31 October for a chronic renal condition. Whilst hospitalized, she shared a room with a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case on 9 November. The patient had no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. She was admitted to ICU but passed away on 1 December.  9. A 42-year-old, non-national male from Taif city who developed symptoms on 17 November. He was admitted to hospital on 20 November. The patient visited a health care facility for a chronic medical condition on 8 November. He had no history of exposure to known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. The patient was admitted to ICU but passed away on 28 November.  10. A 58-year-old male from Taif city who developed symptoms on 15 November. He was admitted to hospital on 20 November. The patient had comorbidities but had no history of exposure to known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. The patient was admitted to an isolation ward but passed away on 7 December.  11. A 48-year-old female from Alkharj city who developed symptoms on 18 November. She is a household contact of a previously-reported MERS-CoV case. The patient had no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Currently, the patient is in stable condition in ICU.  Contact tracing of household contacts and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases.  The National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia also notified WHO of the death of 1 previously reported MERS-CoV case.  Globally, the WHO has been notified of 938 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 343 related deaths.  WHO advice  Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.  Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.  Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.  Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.  WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions. 
1001245	31 May 2001 Disease Outbreak Reported  The Ministry of Health has reported 4 cases including 3 deaths in Danané and Duekoué districts in the south-western part of the country. Yellow fever has been confirmed by IgM detection in a sample collected on 23 March 2001 from a 17 year-old woman who died 24 March 2001. Testing was performed by the Instituts Pasteur, Abidjan and Paris. To date, no further cases have been reported.  The Ministry of Health is continuing its investigation of the outbreak and has begun an immunization campaign using existing vaccine stocks. To ensure that the campaign is successfully carried out, it has requested additional vaccine from WHO and its partners. 
1001246	24 September 2002 Disease Outbreak Reported  As of 23 September 2002, the WHO Collaborating Centre for Arthropod Borne Viruses - Western Hemisphere, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 1 963 human cases of the West Nile virus, with 94 deaths occurring in 32 states and the District of Columbia. During 2002, West Nile virus activity (evidence of infections in birds, humans, mosquitoes, and other animals - primarily horses) has been documented in 42 states and the District of Columbia (see previous report). 
1001247	Nine new confirmed cases were reported from 15 to 21 January in the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. All of the cases were reported from Beni Health Zone in North Kivu Province. Eight of the cases (8/9) were registered contacts prior to symptom onset; all nine had epidemiological links to a confirmed case.   In the past 21 days (1 to 21 January 2020), 35 confirmed cases were reported from 11 health areas within five active health zones in North Kivu and Ituri Provinces (Figure 1, Figure 2, Table 1): Beni (n=14), Mabalako (n=11), Butembo (n=5), Mambasa (n=4), and Musienene (n=1). Beni and Mabalako Health Zones remain the current hotspots of the outbreak, having reported 71% of confirmed cases in the past 21 days. Of the 35 people confirmed with EVD in the past 21 days, 24 were isolated and provided care within the first two days after the onset of symptoms, meaning they have better chances of survival and are less likely to infect contacts in the community. In the past 21 days, only one confirmed EVD death occurred in the community, outside of an Ebola treatment centre.  In recent weeks, contacts of confirmed cases have been offered the option of staying in supportive accommodation allocated for identified EVD contacts where they are provided with food and other essential goods. This allows for systematic daily follow-up of contacts and enables prompt isolation and provision of care to contacts that become symptomatic. As a result, the median time to isolation in the past 21 days has decreased from three days to one day (interquartile range 0-3).   The number of new confirmed cases reported each week has remained stable over the past six weeks, with approximately 14 new EVD cases reported weekly. In addition, improved surveillance indicators such as the proportion of cases listed as contacts and followed prior to detection, and the decreased time to isolation of cases are encouraging signs.   As of 21 January, a total of 3416 EVD cases were reported, including 3297 confirmed and 119 probable cases, of which 2238 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%) (Table 1). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1912) were female, 28% (n=963) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=172) of all reported cases) were healthcare workers.   Analysis of ongoing chain of transmission  As of 21 January, the current transmission chain is comprised of 82 confirmed and probable cases reported in 13 health areas in six health zones; Mabalako, Beni, Biena, Butembo, Katwa, and Musienene Health Zones. The transmission chain originated from one individual who was classified as a relapse of EVD in Aloya Health Area, Mabalako Health Zone (first reported in the Disease Outbreak News published on 19 December 2019). The individual, which is the first and only case of relapse documented in this outbreak, was infected in June 2019, relapsed in November, and passed away in December.   Further analyses indicate that the individual directly infected 29 people while symptomatic in the community for nine days before being isolated. Of the cases who were directly infected from this case, 11/29 were through possible nosocomial transmission. The remaining 52 cases resulted from onward transmissions.   Based on available information regarding the place of exposure for cases in this transmission chain, the main drivers are individuals exposed in the community due to delays to case isolation (50%, 41/82), possible nosocomial transmission (37%, 30/82), and community deaths where cases were exposed during funerals (2%, 2/82). The estimated reproduction number (R), which is the expected number of secondary cases produced by a single infection in a susceptible population, of this transmission chain was not statistically significantly different from the overall mean R of this outbreak, likely due to the limited sample size of cases in the transmission chain which originated in Aloya Health Area. These findings reinforce the importance of early identification of cases and safe and dignified burials.

Public health response  For further information about public health response actions by the Ministry of Health, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:   Ebola situation reports: Democratic Republic of the Congo     WHO risk assessment  WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last assessment concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low.  WHO advice  WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. Any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for travellers to/from the affected countries. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practise good hygiene. Further information is available in the WHO recommendations for international traffic related to the Ebola Virus Disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

1001248	 12 February 2016  On 5 February 2016, the National IHR Focal Point for the United States of America notified PAHO/WHO of a probable case of sexual transmission of Zika virus.  Person A, a resident of Dallas, Texas, travelled to Venezuela for one week between late December and the beginning of January. Several days after returning to the United States, Person A developed symptoms consistent with Zika virus infection, including fever, rash, conjunctivitis, and malaise. One day prior to symptom onset and once during the symptomatic period, Person A had sex with Person B (non-traveller). Approximately one week after the onset of illness in Person A, Person B developed symptoms consistent with Zika virus disease, including fever, pruritic rash, conjunctivitis, small joint arthralgia and malaise.  Laboratory tests confirmed Zika virus infection in both Person A and Person B. Samples collected from Person A at 14 days after symptom onset and from Person B at 4 and 7 days after illness onset had evidence of Zika virus IgM and neutralizing antibodies. Additional tests are being carried out. Local meteorological conditions at the time would not have supported mosquito activity; furthermore, entomological sampling that was conducted in the concerned area yielded no mosquitoes.  WHO risk assessment  This is not the first Zika virus case acquired through sexual transmission. Sporadic cases of infection acquired via this route have already been reported in the literature. The risk of disease spread through sexual activity is very limited. This potential case of sexual transmission does not change the overall risk assessment since the virus is primarily transmitted to people through mosquito bites. The risk of a global spread of Zika virus to areas where the competent vectors, the Aedes mosquitoes, are present is significant, given the wide geographical distribution of these mosquitoes in various regions of the world. WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessment based on the latest available information.  WHO advice  The proximity of mosquito vector breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for Zika virus infection. Prevention and control relies on reducing the breeding of mosquitoes through source reduction (removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between mosquitoes and people. This can be achieved by reducing the number of natural and artificial water-filled habitats that support mosquito larvae, reducing the adult mosquito populations around at-risk communities and by using barriers such as insect screens, closed doors and windows, long clothing and repellents. Since the Aedes mosquitoes (the primary vector for transmission) are day-biting mosquitoes, it is recommended that those who sleep during the daytime, particularly young children, the sick or elderly, should rest under mosquito nets (bed nets), treated with or without insecticide to provide protection.  During outbreaks, space spraying of insecticides may be carried out following the technical orientation provided by WHO to kill flying mosquitoes. Suitable insecticides (recommended by the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme) may also be used as larvicides to treat relatively large water containers, when this is technically indicated.  Basic precautions for protection from mosquito bites should be taken by people traveling to high risk areas, especially pregnant women. These include use of repellents, wearing light colored, long sleeved shirts and pants and ensuring rooms are fitted with screens to prevent mosquitoes from entering.  WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Zika-affected countries based on the current information available. 
1001249	 13 November 2014  On 9 November 2014, WHO was notified by the National IHR Focal Point for Portugal of a large outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in Vila Franca de Xira, a suburban area of Lisbon.  Details of the cases are as follows:  The first 17 cases were identified between 6 and 7 November. Since then, the number of cases has increased exponentially. On 12 November, the Directorate-General for Health of Portugal reported a total of 302 cases of Legionnaires' disease. So far, 5 deaths have been confirmed to be caused by the disease. Four more deaths are currently being investigated. All cases have epidemiological links to the outbreak taking place in Vila Franca de Xira.  This is the biggest Legionella disease outbreak detected in Portugal, and it is evolving rapidly; therefore, the outbreak is considered to be a major public health emergency.  At present, the regional outbreak investigation team is in place and it is supported by a larger national team of experts in epidemiology, clinical, microbiology and environmental health, with other stakeholders from the municipality following the epidemiological situation and undertaking environmental investigations.  Precautionary measures  As precautionary measures, ornamental fountains in the outbreak area have been closed, and the chlorine concentration of tap water has been increased. Cooling towers of the main industrial facilities in the affected area have been closed down.  The Directorate-General for Health of Portugal has issued the following precautionary recommendations to the population, until the source of the outbreak has been identified and eliminated:  to avoid showers, Jacuzzis and whirlpools; to disinfect shower heads by immersion in bleach solutions for about 30 minutes once a week, to set the temperature on water heaters above 75ºC, if possible.  The Directorate-General for Health is liaising with the national agencies for health, environment and meteorology. It is also maintaining close communication and collaboration with partners in the European Union – especially, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) – and with the World Health Organization. WHO Regional Office for Europe and its Centre for Environment and Health in Bonn, Germany have been fully informed, and stand ready to mobilise experts, if required. 
1001250	30 March 2010 - As of 27 March 2010, the Ministry of Health South Africa has reported 63 human cases infected with Rift Valley Fever (RVF), including two deaths in Free State, Eastern Cape and Northern Cape provinces. Most of these cases reported direct contact with RVFV-infected livestock and or linked to farms with confirmed animal cases of RVF. The human cases are: farmers, veterinarians and farm workers. All cases were confirmed with RVF by test conducted at the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) in Johannesburg, South Africa. (see link below)  There is an ongoing outbreak of Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV) infection affecting sheep, goats, cattle and wildlife on farms within Free State, Eastern Cape, Northern Cape, Western Cape, Mpumalanga, North West, Gauteng provinces. As of 29 March 2010, approximately 78 farms reported laboratory-confirmed animal cases, with extensive livestock deaths. (see link below)  Outbreak investigations by the Department of Health and the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries are ongoing, and are being supported by the South African Field Epidemiology and Training Programme (SA-FELTP) and NICD. The Department of Health and the Department of Agriculture are taking measures to enhance disease surveillance among cattle and in managing the control of the disease outbreak.  Sporadic cases of RVF infection in animals have been documented in South Africa in recent years. The last major outbreak of the disease in humans occurred between 1974-76, where an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 cases were affected.

1001251	 26 February 2015  Between 20 and 22 February 2015, the National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia notified WHO of 4 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including 1 death. Cases are listed by date of reporting, with the most recent case listed first.  Details of the cases are as follows: A 58-year-old, non-national male from Dammam city developed symptoms on 18 February and was admitted to hospital on 20 February. The patient has no comorbidities and no history of exposure to any known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Currently, the patient is in stable condition in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward. A 46-year-old male from Khober city was admitted to hospital on 9 February for unrelated medical conditions. The patient was discharged from the hospital on 14 February. He developed symptoms on 17 February and was readmitted to the same hospital on the same day. The patient was treated in the same ward and by the same health workers as three laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases that were reported in a previous DON on 23 February (cases n. 24, 25, 41). He has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Currently, the patient is in critical condition in ICU. A 51-year-old male from Al-Quway'iyah city developed symptoms on 2 February and was admitted to hospital on 18 February. The patient has comorbidities. He has no history of contact with camels; however, he has history of consumption of raw camel milk in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. The patient has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Currently, he is in critical condition in ICU. A 58-year-old female from Buridah city developed symptoms on 16 February while admitted to hospital since 29 December due to an unrelated medical condition. The patient was treated in the same ward and by the same health worker as a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case that was reported in a previous DON on 23 February (case n. 21). She had no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. The patient passed away on 21 February.  The National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia also notified WHO of the death of 4 previously reported MERS-CoV cases. The cases were reported in previous DONs on 23 February (cases n. 1, 3, 17) and on 16 February (case n. 4).  Contact tracing of household contacts and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases.  Globally, WHO has been notified of 1030 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 381 related deaths.  WHO advice  Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.  Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific.

1001252	29 April 2004  The Chinese Ministry of Health has today reported diagnostic confirmation of SARS infection in two patients previously under investigation in Beijing. Confirmation is based on the results of laboratory tests, clinical symptoms, and a history of close contact with a known case.  Both patients are relatives – the mother and an aunt – of a 20-year-old nurse who treated what is thought to be the index case in the outbreak. The nurse subsequently developed respiratory symptoms and was hospitalized on 7 April. She was visited the next day by family members, including the mother and aunt.  The 44-year-old mother is now in critical condition. The 36-year-old aunt, who was diagnosed with bilateral pneumonia earlier this week, remains in stable condition.  Both patients are part of a third generation of cases that includes the nurse’s father and two other patients hospitalized on the same ward, including one patient who shared a room with the nurse.  The number of SARS cases either clinically confirmed or under investigation remains nine: seven in Beijing and two (including the single fatality) in Anhui Province.  In Beijing, all seven SARS cases are now being treated in isolation at Ditan Hospital. This is a risk reduction strategy aimed at preventing further spread through the hospital system.  According to WHO guidelines for the global surveillance of SARS, classification as a confirmed case at the start of an outbreak requires independent verification of results by an external international reference laboratory. Such procedures are considered necessary in view of the implications that confirmed SARS cases can have for international public health. 
1001253	16 October 2000 Disease Outbreak Reported  PRESS RELEASE ISSUED BY WHO   16 OCTOBER 2000  FIRST OUTBREAK OF EBOLA CONFIRMED IN UGANDA  WHO COORDINATES INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE  The World Health Organization (WHO), at the request of the Ugandan Ministry of Health and in conjunction with its partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network*, is coordinating the international response to an outbreak of haemorrhagic fever in Gulu District, northern Uganda.  Laboratory testing carried out at the National Institute of Virology in South Africa indicates that the cause of the outbreak is the Ebola virus. These are the first cases of Ebola ever reported in Uganda.  As of 16 October 2000, 71 suspected cases, including 35 deaths, have been reported. Cases were first reported in a local hospital in Gulu town and are now occurring in the community.  coordinating the international response to the outbreak, implementing disease control measures, such as barrier nursing procedures, case finding, contact tracing and monitoring, and supplying protective equipment.  The Ugandan Ministry of Health has established a National Task Force for the Control of Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers, for managing the response to the epidemic. WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health and this Task Force in disease containment by:  Epidemiologists from the WHO African Regional Office and the WHO office in Kampala, Uganda are already assisting with investigation and implementation of control measures. Drs Mike Ryan and Simon Mardel, epidemiologists from WHO headquarters in Geneva, will leave for Uganda today in order to provide further expertise in clinical management of cases and field investigation of the outbreak.  "WHO and its partners will work with the Ugandan authorities to contain the disease in the outbreak zone and to reduce its spread in local communities," Dr Ryan said. "It is very important that there is effective coordination of the international response to this outbreak."  Initial funding for this rapid response has been provided by the governments of Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Japan.  Ebola haemorrhagic fever is one of the most virulent viral diseases known to humankind, causing death in 50-90% of cases. The Ebola virus is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or semen of infected persons. The Ebola virus was first identified in 1976 in the western equatorial province of Sudan and in the nearby region of Yambuku, northern Democratic Republic of the Congo, (then Zaire.)  _______________  * The Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network is a technical partnership of national and international institutions and smaller networks who mobilize and pool their resources so that outbreaks of potential international importance are detected, verified and responded to efficiently and effectively by the international community. 
1001254	Disease outbreak news  21 July 2013 - WHO has been informed of two additional laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in Saudi Arabia.  Both the cases are currently critically ill and hospitalized in ICUs. The first case is a 41-year-old Saudi male in Riyadh who presented to the hospital with symptoms on 15 July. The second patient is a 59-year-old Saudi female in the Al-Ahsa governorate. She presented with symptoms on 11 July.  Both patients have underlying medical conditions, but neither patient has had contact with known MERS-CoV confirmed cases or animals.  WHO is seeking more information from the National IHR Focal Point of Saudi Arabia.  Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 90 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 45 deaths.  Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.  Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travelers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations.  Specimens from patients’ lower respiratory tracts should be obtained for diagnosis where possible. Clinicians are reminded that MERS-CoV infection should be considered even with atypical signs and symptoms, such as diarrhea, in patients who are immunocompromised.  Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers and visitors.  All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.  WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.  WHO has convened an Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR) to advise the Director-General on the status of the current situation. The Emergency Committee, which comprises international experts from all WHO Regions, unanimously advised that, with the information now available, and using a risk-assessment approach, the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have not at present been met. 
1001255	21 August 1996 Disease Outbreak Reported  The daily number of cases reported in the outbreak which commenced on 5 July 1996 and peaked on 31 July has now declined to 1-2 per day. Up to 21 August, 280 cases had been reported. The outbreak has remained centred in the district of Limassol (204 cases). Cases have been reported from the other 4 districts: Larnaca (10 cases), Nicosia (31 cases), Paphos (5 cases) and Famagusta (30 cases). Eighty-seven per cent (244 cases) have been in children under 14 years of age, with 56% (157 cases) in children under 5 years. There have been no deaths or cases of serious complications.  A WHO team has assisted the Ministry of Health with the operational and epidemiological aspects of the outbreak response. 
1001256	 17 January 2019  WHO is supporting the Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar to respond to an unusually large measles outbreak. Madagascar last experienced measles outbreaks in 2003 and 2004, with reported number of cases at 62 233 and 35 558, respectively. Since then, the number of reported cases had sharply declined until the current outbreak. From 4 October 2018 to 7 January 2019, 19 539 measles cases and 39 “facility-based” deaths (case fatality ratio: 0.2%) have been reported by the Ministry of Public Health (MoH) of Madagascar. Cases were reported from 66 of 114 total districts in all 22 regions of Madagascar. Among the 19 539 measles cases, 375 have been laboratory confirmed (all are IgM+) and 19 164 were confirmed by epidemiological link. Cases confirmed by epidemiological link are those who presented clinical symptoms based on the case definition and had been in contact with another laboratory confirmed or epidemiologically linked case. The outbreak has spread to densely populated urban cities including Toamasina, Mahajanga, Antsirabe, Toliara and the capital city Antananarivo. Most cases were reported from Analamanga (61%) and Boeny (20%) regions. The highest attack rates were observed in Antananarivo-Renivohitra district (714 per 100 000 inhabitants), and Ambato-Boina district (668 per 100 000 inhabitants), in Analamanga and Mahajanga regions, respectively. These rates are considerably higher compared to the national attack rate of 108 per 100 000 inhabitants.  In the current epidemic, children aged 1 to 14 years account for 64% of the total number of cases. The age distribution in this group is as follows: under five years at 35%, 5-9 years at 22% and 10-14 years at 19%. Both sexes are equally affected with a male to female ratio of 1.04. The national immunization programme recommends routine measles immunization for children aged nine months. According to WHO and the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), the estimated measles immunization coverage in Madagascar was 58% in 2017. More than half of the cases (51%) reported during the current outbreak have not been vaccinated or have unknown immunization status. Madagascar has the highest proportion of malnutrition among children under five (47%) in the African region which can increase children's risk of serious complications and death from measles infection.  The circulating genotype for the current measles outbreak in Madagascar is B3, usually found in Africa and Europe. No measles cases with travel history to Madagascar, however, have been reported in neighboring countries and initial investigations in Madagascar have not shown any link with cases from countries with measles outbreak in the Africa region or Europe.  The measles outbreak has occurred concurrently with the resurgence of plague in the country—which reoccurs seasonally—straining the public health response.  Public health response  The Ministry of Public Health of Madagascar is coordinating the response activities, with the support of WHO and other partners. Public Health response measures include:  Enhancement of active surveillance (active case finding, community-based surveillance, distribution of specimen collection kits) in all affected districts. Use of the Global Measles Programmatic Risk Assessment Tool to target priority districts for vaccination. Completion of targeted vaccination campaigns: Campaign conducted from 22 October to 9 November 2018 in four districts of Antanavarivo city. The campaign targeted at least 95% of children aged between nine and 59 months. Preliminary results show coverage of 84% of the targeted population. Campaign planned from 14 to 18 January targeting 2 083 734 children aged between nine months and nine years in 25 districts across 13 regions. The campaign is being funded by Measles Rubella Initiative (MRI), the Government of Madagascar, WHO, UNICEF, Catholic Relief Services (CRS), Commission de l'Océan Indien (COI), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Embassy of France in Madagascar and the World Bank and the total cost is US$ 2 355 989. Reinforcement of routine immunization (one dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) as per the national immunization programme) for children aged between nine and 11 months. Continued management of severe measles cases in referral hospitals, provided to patients free of charge. Vitamin A is being administered to patients under care in all referral and district health centres. Continued community mobilization with the support of UNICEF and USAID, aiming to increase understanding of the disease as well as uptake of the vaccines from campaigns and routine vaccination. Reactivation by USAID of the 910 hotline, formerly used during the 2017 plague epidemic, for information sharing on measles. WHO risk assessment  Measles is an acute, highly contagious viral disease that has potential to lead to major epidemics. Low coverage with measles vaccine combined with a low incidence of measles in recent years in Madagascar has contributed to a significant proportion of the population which is susceptible to measles. According to WHO and UNICEF estimates, the measles immunization coverage in Madagascar was 58% in 2017. The malnutrition rate is also a contributor as malnutrition increases children's vulnerability of serious complications and death from measles infection.  WHO estimates the overall risk for Madagascar from this measles outbreak to be very high. Currently, several concomitant factors are likely to hinder or delay public health intervention and might jeopardize the response: post-election conflict, geographical isolation and remoteness of cases, insecurity, hurricane season and multiple outbreaks. Targeted immunization campaigns and strengthening of routine immunization activities are paramount in the effective control of the outbreak. Administration of Vitamin A, specifically in a context of high rates of malnutrition, can reduce illness and deaths from measles infection.  The risk at the regional level is low although the spread of measles to neighboring Indian Ocean islands and other African countries and Europe cannot be excluded. Strengthening of surveillance in neighboring countries is recommended. The overall global risk is considered to be low.  WHO advice  WHO urges all Member States to:  Vaccinate to maintain coverage of 95% with two doses of MCV. Vaccinate at-risk populations (without proof of vaccination or immunity against measles and rubella), such as health workers, people working in tourism and transportation (hotel and catering, airports, taxi drivers, etc.), and international travelers. Maintain a reserve of MCV and syringes for control of imported cases in each country in the region. Strengthen epidemiological surveillance of fever or rash cases for timely detection of all suspected cases of measles in public and private healthcare facilities and ensure that samples are received by laboratories within five days of being taken. Provide a rapid response to imported measles cases through the activation of rapid response teams to prevent the establishment or reestablishment of endemic transmission. Administer vitamin A supplementation to all children diagnosed with measles to reduce the complications and mortality (50,000 IU for a child less than 6 months of age, 100,000 IU for children 6-12 months of age or 200,000 IU for children 12-59 months); two doses, immediately upon diagnosis and on the following day).  WHO does not recommend any restriction on travel and or trade to Madagascar based on the information available on the current outbreak.

1001257	 11 February 2019  From 27 January and 31 January 2019, the International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point of Oman reported five cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. All five laboratory confirmed cases are females from the same family and range in age from 30-59 years. The source of infection in this cluster is under investigation in Oman and four of the five cases appear to be secondary cases resulting from human-to-human transmission. While all cases did not report direct contact with dromedary camels, they resided on a farm where dromedary camels and other animals were kept. The Ministry of Agriculture is testing the dromedary camels. Details of these five cases can be found in a separate document (see link below).  MERS-CoV cases reported between 27 January and 31 January 2019xls, 114kb  Including these five additional cases, a total of 16 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection have been reported by Oman since 2013. Prior to this cluster of cases, the last case of MERS-CoV infection reported from Oman was in March 2018.  MERS-CoV Disease outbreak news 15 March 2018  Globally, as of 8 February 2019, 2 311 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 811 related deaths have been reported to WHO1.  Public Health response  For all cases, investigation of exposure to known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing. Ministry of Health officials in Oman have established a contact list of healthcare worker and familial contacts in North Batinah Governorate. As of 4 February, a total of 60 familial contacts have been identified, with 26 contacts classified as high-risk. All household members of MERS-CoV cases have been screened for MERS-CoV by RT-PCR and tested negative, except one case reported above, who tested positive on 28 January. As of 4 February, a total of 119 healthcare worker contacts have been identified. All high-risk healthcare worker contacts have been screened for MERS-CoV by RT-PCR and all have tested negative. All identified contacts are monitored for 14 days from the last date of exposure as per WHO and national guidelines for MERS-CoV infection.  While no direct contact with dromedaries has been reported by any of the cases, they resided on a farm where dromedaries and other animals were kept. The Ministry of Agriculture is investigating the dromedary farms. Samples were collected and initial screening results for have tested negative for MERS-CoV. Further results are pending. Healthcare workers were educated and provided a refresher training course in infection prevention and control measures. Family members were educated about MERS-CoV and personal and respiratory hygiene advice was provided.  WHO risk assessment  Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.  The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedary camels, animal products (for example, consumption of camel’s raw milk), or humans (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.  WHO advice  Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.  Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.  Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, people with these conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be or potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.  Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.  WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.  1This global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under IHR to date. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected Member States. 
1001258	25 August 2005  As of 23 August, 7 cases of polio have been reported. Five provinces have been affected: Bengo, Benguela, Luanda, Lunda Sul, Moxico. The most recent case, in Benguela, had an onset of 12 July. This case occurred before the first National Immunization Day (NID) campaign on 29 July.  A second NID will be held tomorrow, 26 August. In order to ensure rapid interruption of the virus transmission in Angola, a third round of NIDs has been planned for late September 2005. The partners in the Polio Eradication Initiative in Angola have asked the international community for financial support to help them carry out this campaign.  For more information Global Polio Eradication Initiative 
1001259	26 March 2004  The Ministry of Health has reported a total of 2 783 cases and 527 deaths from 1 January 2004 - 21 March 2004. Four districts, Diébougou, Naonoro, Gaoua and Zabré, have attack rates above the epidemic threshold and another four districts, Koudougou, Po, Sebba and Seguenega, are in the alert phase. (For more information about the epidemic threshold principle, see the article in the Weekly Epidemiological Record .)  Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A and W135 have been laboratory confirmed, the latter in Naonoro district.  Following a request from the Ministry of Health, the International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Controlhas provided 130, 000 doses of trivalent (ACW135) vaccine. An immunization campaign is planned for Naonoro district. 
1001260	25 May 2006  As of 23 May 2006, Angola has reported a total of 38 897 cases and 1437 deaths (case fatality rate (CFR) 3.6%). In the last 24 hours, 303 new cases including 7 deaths have been reported. Twelve out of 18 provinces are affected; of all cases, 51% have occurred in Luanda and 19% in Benguela province.  (Click image to enlarge, 116k)  The first reports from Lunda-Norte province show a total of 159 cumulative cases and 52 deaths since the beginning of May 2006. The CFR, broken down by province, ranges between 1 and 30% . Although current trends show a decline in Luanda and Benguela provinces, a daily incidence of around 300 cases is still being reported (see epicurve below for weekly incidence).  WHO continues to work with the Ministry of Health and other partners to provide support in coordination, water and sanitation, and intensified surveillance.  (Click image to enlarge, 38k) 
1001261	9 February 2007  The Ministry of Health of Jamaica has confirmed 280 cases of malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum on the island between 6 November 2006 and 3 February 2007. Of these reported cases, 264 have occurred in Kingston, 12 in St Catherine, 3 in St Thomas and 1 in Clarendon. There have been no reported deaths due to malaria.  The Ministry of Health is receiving technical cooperation from the WHO Regional Office for the Americas coordinated by the WHO Country Office and support from the Caribbean Epidemiology Centre to conduct intensified surveillance and to provide information to communities on adequate precautions to protect against mosquito bites. Vector control measures are also being implemented.  The outbreak in Jamaica is subsiding and an interruption in transmission is expected soon. However, the Ministry of Health plans to continue intense surveillance activities.  Jamaica is a non-endemic country for malaria. The occurrence of this outbreak highlights the importance of conducting surveillance in countries that are non-endemic to malaria.  WHO does not recommend any special restrictions to travel or trade to or from Jamaica. 
1001262	 6 September 2017  Between 13 and 30 August 2017, the national IHR focal point of Saudi Arabia reported 12 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), including one death, and one death from a previously reported case.  Details of the cases  Detailed information concerning the cases reported can be found in a separate document (see link below).  MERS-CoV cases reported between 15 August and 30 August 2017xlsx, 48kb  Among the 12 newly reported cases, six were associated with a MERS cluster in Dawmet Aljandal City Al Jawf region, Saudi Arabia. This cluster is not linked to the cluster of MERS that was previously reported in Al Jawf in the Disease Outbreak News posted on 17 August. In this new cluster, the six cases are among 17 household contacts who were being followed up by the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health.  Globally, 2079 laboratory-confirmed cases with MERS-CoV, including at least 722 related deaths have been reported to WHO.  Public health response  The source of infection of this cluster is under investigation by the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Agriculture in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health has identified and is following up health care workers and household contacts of known MERS patients. As per Saudi Arabian policy, listed contacts are not allowed to attend Hajj.  WHO risk assessment  MERS-CoV causes severe human infections resulting in high mortality. Close direct or indirect contact with infected dromedaries is the source of human infections. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.  The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects for additional cases of MERS-CoV infection to be reported from the Middle East. Cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (e.g., contact with dromedaries) or human sources (e.g. in a health care setting).  WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and will conduct risk assessments based on the latest available information.  WHO advice  Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.  Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early, because similar to other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.  Community and household awareness of MERS-CoV and MERS-CoV prevention measures in the home may reduce household transmission and prevent community clusters.  Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, in addition to avoiding close contact with suspected or confirmed human cases of the disease, people with these conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedaries, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.  Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.  WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions. 
1001263	On 2 February 2021, the National IHR Focal Point of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) notified WHO of one (1) laboratory-confirmed case of MERS-CoV.  The case is a 39-year-old male national, owner of a camel farm. He developed fever and cough on 18 January and visited a private hospital several times with no improvement. The condition of the case worsened, and on 24 January, a chest X-ray confirmed the diagnosis of pneumonia. On 26 January, he was admitted to a private hospital and was transferred to a governmental hospital on 28 January. A nasopharyngeal swab was collected on 31 January and tested positive for MERS-CoV by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on 1 February at the Shiekh Khalifa Medical Center laboratory in Abu Dhabi. He has no underlying conditions. SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed more than once, and it was negative. No history of previous infection or exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was reported. The case reported a history of close contact with dromedary camels at his farm in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. No travel history was reported during the same period. Currently, the patient is in stable condition.  The first MERS-CoV case in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was reported in July 2013. Since then, a total of 92 cases of MERS-CoV (including the above case) and 12 associated deaths have been reported in the United Arab Emirates. At a global level, from 2012 until 2 February 2021, the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection cases reported globally to WHO is 2567 with 882 associated deaths. Most of the cases have been reported from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The global number reflects the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO under International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) to date. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with the affected Member States.  In UAE, the surveillance for MERS-CoV during the COVID-19 pandemic mandate testing for all cases meeting severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) definition.     Public health response  Upon identification, an incident report, case investigation, and contact tracing were initiated. The investigation included screening of all close contacts at household and healthcare facilities. All identified contacts of the confirmed case were monitored on a daily basis for the appearance of respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms for 14 days after their last exposure to the confirmed case. All of them have completed the 14-day monitoring period and no further cases were reported. Additionally, all close contacts of the patients have been tested for MERS-CoV and so far all are negative.  The veterinary authorities have been notified and investigation in animals is ongoing.  WHO risk assessment  Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has demonstrated limited ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.   The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. However, with the current COVID-19 pandemic, the testing capacity for MERS-CoV have been severely affected in many countries since most of the resources have been redirected towards SARS-CoV-2. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedary camels, animal products (for example, consumption of camel’s raw milk), or humans (for example, in a health care setting).  WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessments based on the latest available information.     WHO advice  Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.  Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV infection early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection are non-specific.

Early identification, case management, and isolation, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.  MERS-CoV appears to cause more severe disease in people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly dromedary camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.  Food hygiene practices should be observed.

1001264	Disease Outbreak News  27 March 2014 - On 20 and 21 March 2014, the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia announced an additional six laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).  Details of the cases provided to WHO are as follows: A 71 year-old man from the Riyadh region with underlying medical conditions. He became ill on 24 February and was admitted to hospital on 5 March. He is currently in a critical condition. The patient had a history of exposure to animals, including camels. A 66 year-old man from the Riyadh region with underlying medical conditions. He became ill on 9 March and was admitted to hospital on 11 March. He is currently in a critical condition. The patient had no history of exposure to animals. An 86 year-old man from the Riyadh region. He became ill on 11 March and passed away on 19 March. He had no history of exposure to animals. A 75 year-old man from the Riyadh region with underlying medical conditions. He became ill on 23 February and was admitted to hospital on 26 February. He is currently in a critical condition. The patient has a history of exposure to animals, including camels. A 56 year-old man from the Riyadh region with underlying medical conditions. He became ill on 6 March and was admitted to hospital on 13 March. He is currently in a critical condition. The patient has a history of exposure to animals, including camels. A 45 year-old man from the Riyadh region with underlying medical conditions. He became ill on 5 March and was admitted to hospital on 15 March. He is currently in a critical condition. The patient has no history of exposure to animals.  Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 206 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 86 deaths.  WHO advice  Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.  Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. Health-care facilities that provide for patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, health-care workers and visitors. Health care workers should be educated, trained and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control.  It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because some have mild or unusual symptoms. For this reason, it is important that health-care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients – regardless of their diagnosis – in all work practices all the time.  Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.  Patients should be managed as potentially infected when the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.  Health-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.  People at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.  WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions. 
1001265	13 June 2003  Change in travel recommendationsEffective today, the World Health Organization (WHO) is removing its recommendation that people should postpone all but essential travel to Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi and Tianjin regions in China.  Recommendations to consider postponing all but essential travel to these regions of China were issued on 23 April and 8 May in order to minimize the international spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). WHO is changing this recommendation as the situation in these areas has now improved significantly. Information about the decline of the outbreaks in Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi and Tianjin has been carefully reviewed by WHO and suggests that SARS is no longer a potential threat to international travellers to these regions.  Recommendations to postpone travel are issued following consideration of several factors, including the magnitude of current SARS cases, the pattern of recent local transmission, and the last dates of export of cases.  In addition, WHO is removing Guangdong, Hebei, Hubei, Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Shanxi and Tianjin from the list of areas with recent local transmission. This follows confirmation that there have been no new cases isolated in any of these areas for more than twice the maximum incubation period, in other words more than 20 days.  On 27 March, WHO recommended that areas with recent local transmission should screen all international departing passengers to ensure that those who are sick with SARS or are contacts of SARS cases do not travel. This recommendation is still valid for Beijing, Hong Kong and Taiwan in China, and Toronto, Canada. For a summary of travel recommendations, see the table below.  During a recent trip to Beijing, Dr David Heymann, WHO’s Executive Director for Communicable Diseases, commented on the measures now in place in China to contain the spread of SARS. "We’ve seen that there has been a massive effort to mobilize the population both in urban and rural areas across the country, encouraging people to monitor themselves for fever and to ensure that SARS cases are quickly identified, isolated and treated."  "China has made huge strides in its effort to contain the outbreak of SARS," said Dr Heymann. "The key thing now is to maintain vigilance and build up China's disease surveillance system. Public health authorities in China and around the world must continue to watch out for new cases of SARS to ensure that it does not emerge again elsewhere."  Situation in Toronto The category of pattern of SARS transmission for the city of Toronto has been changed from “B” to “C”. This is because a probable case with laboratory confirmation of SARS coronavirus exported from Toronto had not been previously identified as a contact and put into voluntary home isolation. “Pattern B” transmission is defined as an area having more than one generation of local probable SARS cases, but only among persons who have been previously identified and followed-up as known contacts of probable SARS cases. “Pattern C” transmission is defined as an area having local probable cases occurring among persons who have not been previously identified as known contacts of probable SARS cases.

1001266	The ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces saw a stabilization in the number of new cases this past week, with 19 confirmed cases reported in the past week (23–29 October), essentially equivalent to the 20 confirmed cases the week before. The majority (63%) of newly confirmed cases link back to chains of transmission in Biakato Mine Health Area, Mandima Health Zone, including a further three cases detected outside of Mandima in individuals who recently travelled from Biakato.  Onward local transmission has been observed in a limited number of towns and villages within family/social networks or health centers where cases visited prior to their detection and admission to treatment. In Mabalako, seven new cases were reported, of which two were linked to Biakato, two reported local family contact, and two were contacts within local health facilities, suggesting possible nosocomial exposure; investigations are ongoing for the remaining case. In Mambasa Health Zone, one additional case was reported, linked to a large cluster of cases. In Butembo, after over 21 days with no cases, two were reported this week. Both were residents of Kalunguta Health Zone where they were likely exposed. Thus far, there is no evidence of onward transmission in Butembo; nonetheless, these events demonstrate the high risks of reintroduction and resurgence in previously cleared health zones.  During the past 21 days (from 9 – 29 October), 59 confirmed cases were reported from eight active health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Figure 2, Table 1) with the majority reported in three health zones: Mandima (49%, n=29), Mabalako (20%, n=12), and Mambasa (10%, n=6). As of 29 October, a total of 3269 EVD cases were reported, including 3152 confirmed and 117 probable cases, of which 2182 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1841) were female, 28% (n=926) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=163) were health workers.

Public health response  For further information about public health response actions by the Ministry of Health, WHO, and partners, please refer to the latest situation reports published by the WHO Regional Office for Africa:  Ebola situation reports: Democratic Republic of the Congo     WHO risk assessment  WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. The last assessment, carried out on 8 October 2019, concluded that the national and regional risk levels remain very high, while global risk levels remain low.  While the relatively lower case incidence observed is encouraging, it must be interpreted with caution as the situation remains highly contingent upon the level of access and security within affected communities. Concurrent with the decline in case incidence, there was a further shift in hotspots from urban settings to more rural, hard-to-reach communities, within a more concentrated geographical area. These areas bring additional challenges to the response, including an extremely volatile security situation; difficulty accessing some remote areas; delays to engaging with the community which in turn lead to mistrust and misunderstandings; and, potential under-reporting of cases. In such environments, risks of resurgence remain very high, as do the risks of re-dispersion of the outbreak with cases travelling outside of hotspots to seek healthcare or for other reasons. These risks continue to be mitigated by the substantial response and preparedness activities in the DRC and neighbouring countries, with support from a consortium of international partners.     WHO advice  WHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. There is currently no licensed vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus. Therefore, any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for travellers to/from the affected countries. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene. Further information is available in the WHO recommendations for international traffic related to the Ebola Virus Disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
