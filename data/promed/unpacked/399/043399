Institutes charged with the surveillance of
norovirus (NoV) outbreaks in Ireland, Germany,
the Netherlands and Sweden reported high NoV
activity to the European Food-borne Viruses in
Europe network (FBVE) in late 2007. In these
countries, the number of reported NoV outbreaks
exceeds that of October and November of the
previous record seasons, 2004 and 2006. A similar
situation has been reported in the United Kingdom
(UK) [1], and ProMED-mail post Norovirus - UK
20080103.0027].
In recent years, most norovirus outbreaks have
been caused by GII.4 strains. These viruses
evolve rapidly by genetic mutation coupled with
selective pressure. The rapid evolution of GII.4
noroviruses resulting in the successive emergence
of new variants has been observed since 2002. In
the norovirus outbreak season of 2006-7, 2
variants emerged that co-circulated. Early
observations for the 2007-8 season suggest that
one of these variants now dominates. The
currently circulating strains have mutations that
set them apart from the older strains, leading to
one amino acid change in the capsid sequence.
Although we do not consider the strains that
currently circulate as new variants, based on the
global character of norovirus and previous
experience with high numbers of reported
outbreaks we are expecting high norovirus
activity in other countries.
Background
----------------
Noroviruses are known as a common cause of
diarrhea and vomiting, often in outbreaks and
predominantly in winter. Studies across the world
have shown that in recent years most outbreaks
have been caused by strains belonging to a
particular genotype of noroviruses, named GII.4.
The GII.4 strains evolve rapidly and are further
subdivided into variants. Since 1995, 3 variants
have emerged and replaced each other globally, in
1995, 2002, and 2004. In 2006, 2 variants emerged
that co-circulated. Characterisation studies
suggest that lineages evolve through selective
pressure and are likely to be antigenic variants
(drift variants) [2].
For international communication, standardized
nomenclature of variant types is needed. This was
discussed and agreed at the Third Calicivirus
Meeting in Cancun, Mexico, November 2007. A
working group chaired by the Netherlands'
National Institute for Public Health and the
Environment (RIVM) with representatives from the
United States, Canada, Australia and Japan will
prepare a unifying proposal for this in the
coming months. Table 1 lists the currently used
names for reference for the different variants
across the world. [Reference should be made to
the table in the original text to find the
equivalent designations used in different
countries] For example, the current Norovirus
GII.4 2006b strain (FBVE nomenclature) is
designated Minerva-like in the USA , Kobe034-like
in Japan, and V6 in the UK),
Situation in Europe in the 1st part of the current season 2007-8
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the last norovirus outbreak season of 2006-7,
t2 variants of GII.4 NoV circulated in Europe,
causing the majority of viral gastroenteritis
outbreaks [2]. These variants, named GII.4-2006a
and GII.4-2006b in the FBVE network, were found
at approximately equal proportions in most
European countries in the winter of 2006ï¿½7 [2].
Consensus sequences -- the common sequences
derived from multiple alignments of all strains
belonging to each variant or genotype -- of
region A (part of the polymerase gene) and C
(part of the capsid gene) and background
information can be found at:
<http://www.rivm.nl/bnwww>. These regions are the
genome targets that are most often used for
genotyping across the world. The consensus
sequences are freely available from the public
part of the website.
During the summer and autumn of 2007, the
GII.4-2006b variant (in the United States named
Minerva-like, in Japan Kobe034-like, in the UK
V6) became dominant over the GII.4-2006a variant,
and several countries reported a high number of
outbreaks in October and November. Currently the
2 variants still co-circulate, but GII.4-2006b
now seems more prevalent in most European
countries. In the Netherlands in October 2007, 29
NoV outbreaks were reported to the RIVM, of which
26 were genotyped. Of these, 3 (11.5 percent)
were GII.4-2006a and 12 (46 percent) were
GII.4-2006b. In November, 46 outbreaks were
reported. To date, 30 of these have been
genotyped. Of those, 3 (10 percent) were
GII.4-2006a and 22 (73 percent) were GII.4-2006b.
The recent GII.4-2006b strains contain 2
mutations in region A (T4387C and T4543C,
Lordsdale numbering, X86557) and one mutation in
region C (A68C, numbering starts at ATG of GII.4
capsids) discriminating them from older
GII.4-2006b strains. The mutation in region C
results in an amino acid mutation (N23S,
numbering starts at ATG of GII.4). [The sequences
for these strains of region A and C are displayed
graphically in 2 figures in the original text] in
Figures 1 and 2.
[The original text contains a figure giving an
overview of the new strains isolated from
outbreaks reported so far per country and per
month of onset of the outbreak, and an indication
of the fraction of all GII.4 outbreak strains
which hold the observed mutations.
Most countries within the network sequence region
A (polymerase) of the virus, in some cases both
region A and region C sequences are determined
from one outbreak. Ireland and Sweden only
perform region C (capsid) sequencing. The 1st
outbreaks with these characteristics were
reported from Ireland in December 2006. From
October 2007, the numbers of outbreaks rose
sharply in several other European countries. The
number of outbreak reports in the most recent
months are expected to increase significantly
because most countries in the FBVE network are
only able to report sequences one or 2 months
after the date of onset of the outbreak.
Analogous to the situation in the autumn of 2004
and 2006, this indicates a highly active
norovirus winter season [3,4].
Strain characterisation, capsid sequences
-----------------------------------------------------
Additional genome sequencing of 2 strains that
have the mutations in region A showed that the
amino acid mutation in region C is the only amino
acid mutation in the capsid gene. Therefore, the
current high level of seasonal activity can not
be explained by introduction of new antigenic
variants.
The mutations we determined in regions A and C
that set the latest strains apart from the
earlier strains of the 2006b variant are probably
not related to the changes in dominance and may
simply be fixed along with other neutral
mutations. We previously observed similar changes
in dominance of strains and this was usually
accompanied by amino acid changes in the P2
domain of the capsid protein. The earlier strains
of the 2006b variant had several differences in
the P2 domain compared to all other GII.4
variants circulating in previous years. However,
when it first emerged, it was not able to
displace the co-circulating 2006a variant,
suggesting that its ability to infect and
subsequently spread was not yet optimal. The
observations at the start of this season suggest
that the 2006b variant has gained fitness over
the last year, since it has become dominant.
Conclusion
---------------
The start of the norovirus season shows a high
incidence of outbreaks across Europe, caused
mostly by GII.4 viruses belonging to a variant
that emerged globally in 2006. It remains unclear
if the record high reporting is a surveillance
artifact or reflects changes in the epidemiology
of GII.4 strains, although in recent years GII.4
viruses have evolved rapidly by mutation. Given
the high incidence of norovirus infections in the
general population, introduction into health-care
settings is inevitable. Immediate action when
cases are reported and stringent hygiene measures
can reduce the size of outbreaks in healthcare
settings.

[Apart from the epidemiological interest of the
the identification of the norovirus strains
responsible for the disease outbreaks corrently
sweeping across Europe and through the UK, this
provisional analysis has revealed 2 unexpected
findings.
In the 1st place, because of the global nature of
norovirus-associated disease the current high
level of seasonal activity cannot be explained by
the introduction of new antigenic variants.
In the 2nd place, the earlier strains of the
2006b variant had several differences in the P2
domain compared to all other GII.4 variants
circulating in previous years. However, when it
first emerged, it was not able to displace the
co-circulating 2006a variant, suggesting that its
ability to infect and subsequently spread was not
yet optimal. The observations at the start of
this season suggest that the 2006b variant has
gained fitness over the last year, since it has
become dominant. - Mod.CP]
