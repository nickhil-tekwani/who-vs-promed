Source: Information provided by Dr. Louise McFarland, Louisiana State
Epidemiologist

The Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals reports a confirmed case
of EEE (Eastern Equine Encephalitis) in a horse with onset 19 March 2000.
The 6 year old, unvaccinated Shetland pony resided in Pitkin (Vernon
Parish), Louisiana, which is in west-central Louisiana, on the Texas
border. Pitkin is in the southeastern portion of the parish, just to the
southeast of Fort Polk (Leesville). Dr. McFarland indicates that the past
winter was mild in Louisiana, possibly accounting for the early-season
transmission.
