The Health Department has reported that four workers at Cooma abattoir had
come down with severe cases of Q fever, and another 20 were showing symptoms.
The Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer, had been due to visit the Cooma
abattoir today, but was asked to cancel after the outbreak was discovered.
Mr Inall was cited as saying that Q fever has vaccination
protection available. Transmission of the bacteria was generally associated
with saleyards, with producers most susceptible to infection during the
"dry, windy period in August-September".
The last reported outbreak of Q fever was the infection of 26 meat workers
at Young, in southern NSW, in January last year [see refs. above -
Mod.JW
As more than 100 000 farmers are at risk, a national campaign to encourage
beef and dairy farmers, wool growers and sheep meat producers to undertake
a voluntary Q fever testing and vaccination program is being mounted by the
nation's beef industry body, the Cattle Council of Australia. This follows
saleyard blood testing by CSL, the privatised former Commonwealth Serum
Laboratories, showing that one third of primary producers may already carry
the bacteria's antibodies.
The Cattle Council's director of communication and planning, Mr David Inall,
was cited as saying that producers already carrying the antibodies may not
need vaccination, but would need to be tested. This would cost about
A$40. It would cost about A$100 for those needing vaccination. Most
meat workers have already been vaccinated.
[For those uncertain of their medical history, 'Q Fever' was first described
in Queensland, Australia - Mod.MHJ
