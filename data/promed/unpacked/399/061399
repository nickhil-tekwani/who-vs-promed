Health specialists have expressed concerns about a potential fresh outbreak of the deadly Nipah virus (NiV), following the confirmation of 2 recent deaths from NiV infection and 4 more suspected fatalities.

Laboratory tests at the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) has confirmed that 2 boys -- aged 13 and 14 -- died from NiV [Nipah virus] infection at Shibaloy and Ghior of Manikganj district [Dhaka division] on the last week of December last year [2013]. Both of them died after being infected with the virus by drinking raw date-palm sap (Khejurer Rosh).

Sources said it was also suspected that the deaths of 4 more people, including a 5 year old boy at the Rajshahi Medical College Hospital (RMCH) last week [week ending 11 Jan 2014], may also be linked to NiV infection.

The deceased were a man of 45 from Bagha upazila of Rajshahi; a 5 year old from Pabna's Ishwardi; an individual of 20 from Naogaon; and another 20 year old from Natore's Bagatipara [all in Rajshahi division].

Doctors at the RMCH said they suspected that the deaths may have been caused by Nipah infection, as all 4 patients had the history of drinking raw date-palm sap.

Prof Dr Mahmudur Rahman, director of the IEDCR, however, told the Dhaka Tribune yesterday [11 Jan 2014] that the Nipah virus was not found in the single sample of the deceased that had so far been tested at the lab. Samples from 2 other deceased would be tested by Monday [13 Jan 2014], he said, adding that sample from another patient had not yet arrived at the IEDCR.

As a preventative measure for the disease, Dr Mahmudur urged people not to drink raw date-palm sap and also urged the product's sellers to refrain from selling raw sap. A mass awareness programme about the disease was also needed across the country, he added.

Seeking anonymity, several senior health officials said the health education bureau spent money by publishing NiV health message advertisements on newspapers, but failed to initiate any direct programme to create awareness among the masses.

Prof Dr Be-Nazir Ahmed, director of the Communicable Disease Control (CDC), said the CDC had launched a programme at 18 upazilas in the Nipah-prone areas to create awareness among the raw date-palm sap sellers. The CDC director however said he had no knowledge about the 4 suspected NiV deaths in Rajshahi.

The NiV -- an enveloped RNA virus belonging to genus _Henipavirus_ -- is a highly pathogenic paramyxovirus, which is transmitted by the drinking of virus-contaminated raw date palm sap or through close physical contact with Nipah infected patients.

The NiV infection has a fatality rate of 78 per cent, with 148 people out of the 189 reported cases between 2001 and May 2013 succumbing to the disease in the country.

[This is the season for cases of Nipah virus infection to occur. The transmission season is usually January to April. Curiously, no mention is made in the above report or in the previous one this year (ProMED-mail archive no. 20140113.2168940) of the virus's reservoir host, _Pteropus_ fruit bats, that contaminate date palm sap that is consumed by local people. As mentioned in comments in that previous post, local residents scarify the upper areas of palm trees to collect sap in large jars. The bats come to drink the sap, and defecate and urinate in the sap. If the bats are shedding Nipah virus, it contaminates the sap. If the sap is consumed uncooked, humans that drink it can become infected. Local people say that cooking the sap alters the flavor. However, skirts made of local bamboo can serve as a barrier preventing bats' access to the sap collecting sites. It is unfortunate that the public awareness efforts have not prevented these cases from occurring. Perhaps because cases are sporadic and geographically scattered, there is little perception of risk of infection and serious disease.
