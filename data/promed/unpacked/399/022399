Agricultural pesticides have been identified as the culprits in recent
fishkills on the Tryon and Westmoreland Rivers [both on Prince Edward
Island. The Department of Technology and Environment announced Tuesday
tests carried out at the Atlantic Veterinary College had determined the
sudden deaths of large numbers of fish had been caused by toxins.
Dissolved oxygen and temperature were ruled out as possible causes in the
fishkills.
Test results from the Lord's Pond area of the Tryon River found the
pesticide azinphos-methyl in concentrations toxic to fish. The pesticide
carbofuran was found, but at levels considered below water quality
guidelines. The pesticides were detected in an area near washout from a
potato field, but were not found in water samples taken from standing water
upstream from the field.
Samples taken near the Westmoreland fishkill found 4 pesticides in runoff
from a field. The pesticides were carbofuran, chlorothalonil, endosulfan
and mertibuzin--the first 3 in concentrations exceeding water quality
guidelines. Chlorothalonil and azinphos-methyl were detected in sediment
samples taken near the Westmoreland fishkill.
