Diseases eating up padi yield
-----------------------------
Padi farmers in Kedah and Perlis [states of West Malaysia] expect a fall in crop yield in the 2014 second season following attacks by various diseases.

Md Nor Hamzah, Malaysian Entrepreneurial Farmers Club, said the decline was due to the spread of bacterial leaf blight (BLB), bacterial leaf stripe [streak] (BLS) and rice blast fungus (karah) as a result of using seeds with weak disease resistance.

[Authorities] should find new [varieties for] seeds as the [currently used] MR220 and CL2 seeds are no longer resistant to diseases. "Farmers [previously] obtained around [9 tonnes per hectare] but with the attack by BLB, BLS and karah, we expect 80 percent of the padi growing areas to suffer lower output," he said.

[Bacterial leaf blight and streak
--------------------------------
Bacterial leaf blight (BLB) of rice is caused by _Xanthomonas oryzae_ pv. _oryzae_ with reported yield losses of up to 60 percent. The pathogen causes yellowing and drying of leaves, wilting of seedlings, and blight lesions (for severe strains), which may also affect panicles. Various saprophytic fungi may invade the lesions, contributing to the damage. BLB is favoured by rain, high levels of fertilizer, high humidity, standing pools of water and warm temperatures. The bacterium is short-lived in soil and suspected to be seed borne but also to be short-lived in seeds. Grassy weeds, infected plant material such as rice stubble or ratoons and contaminated irrigation systems are thought to be the primary pathogen reservoirs. The disease spreads by windblown rain and mechanical means (for example when transplanting seedlings or by high insect activity).

A different pathovar (strain) of the same species, _X. oryzae_ pv. _oryzicola_ causes bacterial leaf streak of rice. It occurs in Asia and West Africa and yield losses of up to 30 percent have been recorded. Symptoms vary from BLB early on, but in the later stages of the disease look similar to BLB. They may include translucent interveinal streaks extending to become orange lesions which may kill the leaf. Yellowish bacterial exudates may be seen. Bacteria may enter through small wounds on the leaf surface, including insect damage. Plants are susceptible at all stages, but infection is most damaging at the tillering stage. BLS is more prevalent in the rainy season. The pathogen survives between seasons on volunteer rice and leaf debris. It is seed borne and can also be spread with infected plant and other materials, by water (rain, irrigation) and mechanical means (including insect activity).

Disease management for both diseases is difficult and may include phytosanitation (control of weed and volunteer rice reservoir hosts, removal of contaminated materials), cultural measures (optimal plant spacing and fertilizers), bacteriocides (such as copper compounds) and use of resistant crop varieties.

Rice blast
----------
Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Magnaporthe oryzae_ (previously classified as a strain of _M. grisea_, synonym _Pyricularia oryzae_). It is one of the most destructive diseases of rice worldwide, with potential yield losses of more than 50 percent. Symptoms include lesions on all parts of the shoot, as well as stem rot and panicle blight. When nodes are infected, all plant parts above the infection die and yield losses are severe. When infection occurs at the seedling or tillering stages, plants are often completely killed. More than 50 species of grasses and sedges can be affected by related pathogens, but most strains isolated from rice can only infect a limited number of cultivars.

Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by climatic conditions. The disease is also favoured by high nitrogen levels (for example from fertilizers) and high humidity. The fungus is spread by infected plant debris, mechanical means (including insect activity), water and wind. Disease management may include fungicides and cultural practices but relies mainly on resistant varieties. However, the fungus is highly variable, and this favours the emergence of new strains with increased virulence.


In Malaysia, a breeding programme for rice varieties suitable for national needs has been established (see link below). The cultivars MR220 and CL2 mentioned above had been developed earlier within that programme. But the local emergence of host resistance breaking strains of the pathogens, as reported above, increases the risk of severe crop losses and rice varieties with improved resistances are needed.
