A 41-year-old man died on Sunday night [5 Feb 2017] in Valdivia city as a result of a hantavirus infection after having done agricultural work.

The individual was admitted to the Valdivia regional hospital after presenting with a severe cardiorespiratory picture that caused his death, according to the Health SEREMI [regional ministerial unit], Claudio Mendez who informed Radio Biobio.

This regional [health] authority stated that now there are 2 fatal victims who have been found to have been working on weed clearance in rural areas of the Los Lagos region. It is worth noting that this is the 3rd fatal victim of the total of 14 cases of infection by [a] hantavirus that has occurred so far in 2017.

Metropolitan region

We remember [to note] that there are 2 youths of just 15 years of age hospitalized in the Clinica Alemana in Santiago. The infection of both of these adolescents happened after they visited the San Carlos community in the Bio Bio region last January [2017]. According to the background on these cases, both adolescents, a boy and a girl, are in serious condition, connected to mechanical ventilation and receiving intensive therapy that these cases require.

The Ministry of Health stated that the representatives of the group have been contacted to alert them to be attentive to [occurrence] of the symptoms [of the infection].

How to avoid infection

The disease [virus] is transmitted by the pygmy long-tailed rice rat that happens when aerosols of their feces, urine and saliva are inhaled.

According to the explanation of María José Catalán, staff member of the Faculty of Nursing of the Universidad Andrés Bello, although the case fatality of this disease in Chile has declined during recent decades, it continues to cause deaths in 1/3 of the infections, which is why the call for prevention continues to be made.

"Since the transmission of this disease [virus] occurs mainly in closed areas with little ventilation and sunlight, where rodents have been present, one must avoid any type of contact with wild rats, their excrement and urine," the specialist indicated.

"Before entering cabins, sheds, storage buildings or dwellings, one must ventilate the area for at least 30 minutes. Then once within the place, look to see if there are signs of rodents and one must spray the floor with bleach or disinfectant products, always using masks and gloves," pointed out María José Catalán.

Only after taking these steps, the specialists explained, one can clean, vacuum, shake out furniture or sweep the area in order to carefully throw away the trash collected in the area. "With the cleanup complete, the trash must be placed in a well-sealed plastic bag, then the contents best be buried or incinerated."

Then, for those who live in areas of risk, the UNAB expert recommends that "it is important to close cracks and openings of their houses, together with take away household firewood, remove weeds from the patios and cut the grass in a radius more than 30 meters [100 ft] [from the house]".

[Cardiopulmonary complications can develop very rapidly with these hantavirus infections. Medical attention as early as possible is urgent. Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and this only occurs with very close physical contact, usually within the family.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg.
