12m food-and-mouth vaccines shipped to S. Korea
-----------------------------------------------
Intervet/Schering-Plough Animal Health announces today [4 Mar 2011]
that it has shipped 12 million doses of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD)
vaccine to South Korea to assist in the country's efforts to halt the
ongoing FMD outbreak.

Since early January 2011, when Intervet/Schering-Plough Animal Health
in South Korea received the initial request from the South Korean
government, the company has provided cumulatively close to half of all
FMD vaccine doses that have been delivered to the country to date. The
12 million doses of [the] inactivated oil-adjuvanted vaccine, have
been produced at the company's international competence center for FMD
vaccine research, development and production in Cologne (Germany).

Dr. Klaus Kriebitzsch, Site Director of the FMD facility explains:
"Our vaccine site in Cologne has again demonstrated its capability to
respond to a short-term demand in an emergency situation by quickly
upscaling the production, release and packaging processes of FMD
vaccine."

Paul van Aarle, DVM, Director Institutional Sales at
Intervet/Schering-Plough Animal Health adds: "We are extremely proud
to have proven once again that we are ready to address emergencies,
deliver the required vaccine, meeting agreed quantities and timelines
and thereby helping the government of South Korea to battle the
current FMD epidemic."

Since the FMD outbreak was reported by the South Korean government in
November 2010, more than 3 million pigs, cattle, goats and deer have
been culled. Late December 2010 the South Korean Ministry for Food,
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries decided to start vaccinating all
13 million livestock in the country after initial measures were not
effective in controlling the outbreak.

It is anticipated that the ongoing large scale vaccination campaign
will soon show result in control of the outbreak in concert with the
other measures applied.

Onderstepoort to reintroduce foot and mouth vaccine line
--------------------------------------------------------
The government [of South Africa, or SA] is investing in a new
facility to make vaccines against FMD at the Onderstepoort Veterinary
Institute -- which falls under the Agricultural Research Council (ARC)
-- as it moves to reintroduce a capacity lost a decade ago.

Agriculture Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson said on Monday [28 Feb
2011] exports of cloven-hoofed animals and their products had been
suspended after a "suspected" outbreak of the disease. The suspension
has potentially crippling implications for SA's meat export industry.

The Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute began making FMD in the late
1960s, but stopped in 2005 after its technology became obsolete.

The development of a new local facility will help ensure a close
match between vaccines and the specific strains of the virus
circulating.

Vaccines are used against FMD in some countries including SA, while
others such as the UK opt solely for slaughter.

Prof Jeena said it would cost R250m [USD 36 469 730] to build the new
vaccine manufacturing plant at Onderstepoort, the only facility that
had the necessary bio-safety controls to produce the shots. FMD is
highly contagious and spreads easily between species.

Prof Jeena said livestock in SA was vulnerable to the "Southern
African strain" of FMD, and there were [several] variations
circulating at any one time. The local strain of the disease was more
difficult to work with than strains found in other parts of the world,
as it was less stable, produced lower vaccine yields and had a
shelf-life of no more than a year.

Prof Jeena said Onderstepoort hoped to have a pilot facility set up
"within the next couple of months," and expected to manufacture
emergency stock to deal with an outbreak within the next 18 months.

Onderstepoort's acting programme manager for trans-boundary animal
diseases, Dr Livio Health, said scientists expected to have the
results of their analysis of the strain responsible for the outbreak
in KwaZulu-Natal early next week.

[The number of FMD-vaccine manufacturers in Europe was reduced since
1990, when the EU banned the use of vaccine in member states. This ban
was followed by OIE's establishment of a procedure for the official
recognition of the "FMD free" status of Members, including "freedom
without vaccination." In 1998, the official agreement between the
World Trade Organization (WTO) and the OIE further confirmed the OIE's
mandate to recognise disease-free areas.

Subsequently, a steadily growing number of countries attained the
status "FMD free." However, several major FMD epizootics -- such as
the one in the UK in 2001 and the Japanese and South Korean in 2010,
where mass-culling had to be applied, causing discontent of the public
-- may have provided the background to renewed needs for the vaccine.

A worldwide list of FMD-vaccine producers can be found at
<http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/IICAB/Vaccines/Disease/diseFMD.htm>; it
would help to check if the said list is updated. - Mod.AS]
