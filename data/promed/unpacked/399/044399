VIRAL DEATH TOLL REACHES 54
Taipei, June 29 (CNA) As of Monday, 262 people have been hospitalized for
enterovirus infections, and of them 54 have died, according to sources from
the Department of Health.
The two most recent deaths were those of a 2-year-old boy who died at
Taipei's Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital on June 24, only 10 days after he
was diagnosed as being infected with the virus, and a 9-month-old girl who
died the same day at Taichung's Veterans General Hospital.
The girl had lived two months after being diagnosed as having the virus,
the longest period of time anyone in Taiwan has lived after being infected,
said Hsu Hsu-mei, deputy director of the DOH's Communicable Disease Control
Bureau.
To more effectively treat the disease, Hsu suggested doctors check
patients' brains with the aid of the magnetic resonance imaging.
Previous autopsies have shown victim's brain stems had fatal lesions,
whereas doctors originally thought the children had died from pulmonary
edema [fluid in the lungs - Mod.JW, meningitis or encephalitis.
Some doctors have been able to save the lives of patients infected with the
virus by curing the lesions on their brain stems.
Although the DOH has said the epidemic has already peaked in Taiwan, the
number of suspected infections totaled more than 1,000 island wide as of
Monday. The virus first began ravaging children on the island in
mid-February.
The DOH initiated an island wide "hand-washing" campaign on Monday, urging
the public, especially children, to wash hands more frequently and more
thoroughly to help stop the spread of the epidemic.

The important thing to learn from Taiwan and Malaysia EV-71 epidemics is to
teach parents directly not only on watching the early symptoms/signs but
also the prevention precautions. The leadership including clinicians,
pathologists, virologists, epidemiologists, and neurologists is quite
important. Prevention of infection is always more efficient than curing
cases.
Once parents are taught properly, the chain of transmission will be more
effectively interrupted. However, we still have to pay more attention
until the true ending of this epidemic. Several autopsy cases did not show
myocarditis. Therefore, the pathogenesis of EV71 is worthwhile pursuing,
its mechanism in the damage
in brain stem and later pathogenesis in secondary organs.
