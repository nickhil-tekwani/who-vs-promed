Regarding reports of a fatal case in Minnesota, Rocky Mountain
spotted fever (RMSF) was the most common cause of
arthropod-associated death in the USA for many years; but this
"distinction" is now held by West Nile fever. See graphs at
<http://exhibit.gideononline.com/rmsf1.png> and
<http://exhibit.gideononline.com/rmsf2.png>.
These graphs were generated using a user-driven Gideon menu, which
contains over 30 000 base graphs].

[Not only is RMSF no longer the most common cause of
arthropod-associated human fatalities, but also it is no longer the
most common tick-borne disease in the USA, replaced by Lyme
borreliosis. - Mod.LL]
