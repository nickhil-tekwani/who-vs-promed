Since [Tue 1 Aug 2017], the Kentucky Department for Public Health (DPH) has identified 1170 cases of acute hepatitis A, a liver disease caused by the hepatitis A virus. An increase in cases since [Tue 1 Aug 2017], primarily among the homeless and drug users, prompted declaration of a statewide outbreak in November 2017. Viral sequencing has linked several outbreak-associated cases in Kentucky with outbreaks in California and Utah.

DPH is working closely with the CDC and local health departments to provide guidance and education to health professionals and at-risk populations. Treatment for acute hepatitis A generally involves supportive care, with specific complications treated as appropriate. Hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable disease.

Counts as of [Sat 14 Jul 2018]:

Total Outbreak: 1170
Hospitalizations: 659
Deaths: 8

[The cases in Kentucky continue to increase dramatically and have left Michigan, the 2nd-highest state for hepatitis A cases, in the dust. Addressing the marginalized cohorts of humanity affected the most, including the homeless and substance abusers, by supplying adequate sanitation and living conditions as was done in the San Diego [CA] area is needed to deal with these outbreaks occurring in a so-called developed world country such as the USA. Spill-over into other portions of the population such as restaurant diners affected through infected food handlers will continue. It is not clear how many of this rapidly increasing total are in individuals outside the described cohorts.

In a follow-up on the hepatitis A outbreak that began in March 2018 in West Virginia, health officials now put the outbreak total at 699 cases, up some 160 cases in 2 weeks. Twenty West Virginia counties have been affected, with Kanawha (363) and Cabell (153) counties accounting for 75 percent of the state total. A total of 428 people, or 61 percent of those affected, have been hospitalized, with 2 deaths recorded.

The outbreak has primarily been among injection and non-injection drug users (80 percent), homeless or mobile individuals (15 percent), and those who have been recently incarcerated. Nearly 8 out of 10 cases have co-infection with either hepatitis B or C. Viral sequencing has linked cases from Kentucky and California.

These are weekly numbers similar to what is currently occurring in Kentucky. West Virginia at this rate will soon pass California and then threaten Michigan for 2nd on the HAV case number list. - Mod.LL

Since November 2017, the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) has been investigating an outbreak of acute hepatitis A virus (HAV). Cases have been infected with HAV strains genetically linked to outbreaks across the USA. Indiana has an average of 20 cases of hepatitis A per 12-month period.

Indiana is one of several states experiencing a hepatitis A outbreak, and outbreak-related cases have been confirmed across the state. Information on other outbreaks can be accessed from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website. Transmission is presumed to occur person to person; no contaminated commercial food product has been identified. Based on CDC guidelines, populations who are homeless, transient, or incarcerated or who use illicit drugs, as well as the close direct contacts of these populations, are considered at increased risk of exposure to hepatitis A.

If you believe you have been exposed to hepatitis A or are homeless, use injection or non-injection drugs, were recently incarcerated, or had contact with someone who has hepatitis A, contact your healthcare provider about hepatitis A vaccine.

To reduce the risk of hepatitis A transmission, people who have not received 2 doses of hepatitis A vaccine may ask their healthcare providers for protection. Additionally, always wash your hands with soap and water after going to the bathroom, after changing diapers, and before preparing meals for yourself and others. Do not attend work or school if you are experiencing symptoms of hepatitis A, which include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, tiredness, stomach ache, fever, dark-colored (cola) urine, light-colored stool, and jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes). Symptoms may take as many as 50 days from exposure to appear.

Using the Indiana outbreak definition (see below), the ISDH will update this website each Friday to reflect counties that have 5 or more outbreak-related cases. The ISDH updated the outbreak definition on [Fri 20 Jul 2018] and may reflect additional cases that were not included in previous outbreak case counts.

Indiana outbreak case definition: confirmed hepatitis A cases (hepatitis A IgM positive with acute symptom onset and either jaundice or elevated liver enzymes) acquired since [Wed 1 Nov 2017], through person-to-person transmission within the USA. Cases may be excluded from the outbreak if a confirmed case has no known risk factors (illicit drug use, homelessness, incarceration, men who have sex with men, contract with a confirmed case or domestic travel to an area with a known outbreak) and has traveled outside of the USA to a country with endemic hepatitis A or if a confirmed case has a specimen identified as any genotype (laboratory test link) other than 1B.

Up-to-date numbers from Indiana can be found at https://www.in.gov/isdh/27791.htm.
