Two West Gippsland [Victoria] dairy farmers one day noticed their cows were lethargic. They did not know what was going on, so called a veterinarian.

They discovered a blood parasite was attacking their cows, which ended up decreasing milk production by 20 per cent. "A good cow will go to a very skinny cow in 36 to 48 hours," the farmer said.

"It's unbelievable how quick they'll drop. It scares you to be honest. You can pick it up as soon as you see them off colour, you can guarantee in 12 hours they'll look a lot worse."

_Theileria_ is widespread in Queensland and Northern New South Wales (NSW). In Victoria, veterinarians have been treating cases since 2007. The 1st outbreak of the disease occurred in South Australia in October last year [2014].

Tim Henderson, from Drouin Veterinarian Clinic, said he had been treating more cases of theileriosis in west Gippsland, eastern Victoria, in recent years.

"The parasite breaks down the red blood cells. The cows become anaemic, they become weak, have laboured respiration. Some can die as a result. Those that don't and are heavily pregnant can abort, and obviously milk production suffers.

"In the past it hasn't been that common, we used to get 1 or 2 cattle here and there. Since about 2011, we've been seeing quite a number of farms with many cows affected. It seems to be associated with introduction of cattle from northern states, such as NSW."

Dr Henderson said there were not a lot of treatment options. "There have been anecdotal reports that antibiotics and certain anti-tick fever medications, in the mildly affected cattle, can help," he said.

"Generally speaking the best option for the milking cow is to dry her off and strict rest," Dr Henderson said.

About 10 per cent of the [West Gippsland] herd was affected, with some deaths. "It would have toned our peak milk production by a good 15 to 20 per cent," [the farmer] said.

"Even now we are only level pegging with last year's [2014] production, with more cows. Now we haven't had any cases for 8 to 10 weeks. So we're quite confident we're through it."

[_Theileria_ are protozoan parasites carried by ticks. When ticks carrying theileria feed on cattle, the parasite gets into their bloodstream and enters the red blood cells. In some animals, sufficient red blood cells are destroyed to cause anemia -- a reduction in the red blood cell numbers. This reduces the ability of blood to carry oxygen and makes the animal ill.

A protozoan referred to as _Theileria buffeli_ has been present in Australia for around 100 years. It has been seen occasionally in blood smears of cattle from "ticky" country, but seldom caused any illness. It was considered a benign infection.

Generally ticks are the carriers (vectors) responsible for spread of theileria throughout the world. In New South Wales, the bush tick (_Haemaphysalis longicornis_) is suspected to be responsible, though other ticks could be involved. Small numbers (fewer than 10 ticks) are able to spread the infection. Many farmers on affected properties have not observed ticks on affected cattle. Experimentally lice and march flies (or horse flies) have also been shown to transmit infection.
