Three people have died from _Listeria_-infested asparagus soup at Odense University Hospital. The deaths are a result of a new listeriosis outbreak and are not related to the one that has been traced to the deli meat rullepoelse, which has claimed 16 lives [See prior ProMED-mail post Listeriosis - Denmark (03): (Copenhagen) fatal, deli meat susp, more cases 20140910.2764685].

"There are 2 different outbreaks, and they are not connected. In the asparagus soup [outbreak], it is a completely different strain of _Listeria_ than in the rullepoelse outbreak. The deaths we have listed on our website are only from the rullepoelse outbreak," Tyra Grove Krause of the Danish State Serum Institute (SSI) told Ritzau news agency.

The asparagus soup outbreak has sickened 5 patients over the past 6 months. Three of the infections proved fatal, with the most recent death in April 2014.

A recent check by the Danish Food and Veterinary Service (Foedevarestyrelsen) found traces of _Listeria_ in 3 soups at Odense University Hospital and Svendborg Hospital. _Listeria_ was also found in meatballs served with the soups. The infected asparagus soup was served to patients through 21 Sep 2014.

[Listeriosis is an illness caused by eating foods contaminated by the bacterium, _Listeria monocytogenes_, a gram-positive bacillus. _Listeria_ can be in a variety of raw foods as well as in processed foods and foods made from unpasteurized milk. The process of making asparagus soup, if cooked at temperatures higher than 150 F (65 C), should have killed _Listeria monocytogenes_, the gram-positive bacillus that is the cause of listeriosis, in any of the soup's ingredients. However, _Listeria_ can contaminate foods after the food is cooked, and unlike many other foodborne bacteria, _Listeria_ multiply at refrigerator temperatures (between 35-38 F (2-3 C). If previously refrigerated soup had been reheated sufficiently before serving, _Listeria_ again should have been killed. The FDA recommends that soups, sauces, and gravy should be brought to a boil when reheating, and leftovers should be reheated to 165 F (74 C) (http://www.fda.gov/food/resourcesforyou/consumers/ucm079667.htm). Presumably, the asparagus soup was served cold or insufficiently reheated to hospitalized patients, many of whom were likely at high risk of developing listeriosis.

Odense and Svendborg are cities on the island of Funen in the Region of Southern Denmark (Region Syddanmark) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region_of_Southern_Denmark). Odense, with a population of 172 512 in 2014, located 45 km (28 miles) north of Svendborg, is the 3rd largest city in Denmark (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odense). Svenborg, with a population of 26 672 in 2014, is Funen's 2nd largest city (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svendborg). Odense University Hospital is said to be the largest hospital in Denmark (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odense_University_Hospital).
