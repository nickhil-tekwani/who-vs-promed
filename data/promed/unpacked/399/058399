China's Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) has confirmed an outbreak of goat plague in northeast China's Liaoning Province.

An MOA announcement Friday [21 Mar 2014] said that 24 goats showed symptoms of the disease on 17 Mar 2014 in 2 villages in Jinzhou City, of which 11 died. The national exotic animal disease research center on Friday confirmed that the epidemic was [goat plague; see comment].

Local authorities have sealed off and sterilized the area where 56 infected goats and [other] goats from the same herds are being culled, according to the MOA.

[Goat plague] is a contagious disease mainly affecting goats and sheep. The virus causes fever, lesions, labored breathing and diarrhea in infected animals.

[PPR (peste des petits ruminants), called also "goat plague," stomatitis-pneumoenteritis syndrome, pneumoenteritis complex (and -- erroneously -- also "sheep rinderpest," a term deleted from the above report), is a highly contagious disease of goats and sheep caused by a morbillivirus. PPR's clinical signs, as seen in small ruminants, resemble rinderpest in cattle. Heavy losses can be seen, especially in goats; all of the affected animals in some herds may die. The disease is included in OIE's list (formerly, it was a List A disease); it is not zoonotic. An effective and safe, live attenuated vaccine is available and has been applied in numerous affected counties with satisfactory results. Additional information on PPR is available at http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/peste_des_petits_ruminants.pdf.

Since the start of the PPR epizootic in northwest China, on 5 Dec 2013, the disease has been spreading eastwards. On 13 Feb 2014, China reported an outbreak in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region; the current outbreak, in northeast China's Liaoning Province (bordering North Korea) means a leap of about 1300 km (about 800 miles) eastwards. For the locations of the previous 8 outbreaks, including the one in Ningxia, see OIE's interactive map (click to centre, zoom in) at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=14492.

China's PPR control policy is based upon stamping out without vaccination combined with quarantine measures. Without vaccination, the disease may continue its rapid spread. China's small ruminants population (2012 OIE data) is 143 680 000 sheep and 141 361 000) goats. - Mod.AS
