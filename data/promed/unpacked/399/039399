The Department of Preventative Medicine, a part of the Ministry of Health, yesterday [18 Jan 2015] said that the country has recorded 1551 cases of hand-foot-mouth disease since the beginning of the year [2015].

Of the 1551 children infected one succumbed to the disease. The figure is down by 31.2 percent compared to the same period last year [2014]. However, the development of the disease is very complicated as the virus is acute. Infected children have with similar symptoms such as high fever, sore throat, and fluid-filled blisters appeared on the hands, feet, and inside the mouth.

Hand-foot-mouth disease can occur year-round but the peak season is in the summer and fall months. The viruses that cause Hand-foot-mouth disease can be spread in respiratory droplets. It can also be spread when poor hand-washing after a diaper change or contact with saliva (drool) allows the virus to be passed from one child to another.

[Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is a common infectious disease of infants and children. The symptoms commonly observed include fever, painful sores in the mouth, and a rash with blisters on hands, feet, and also buttocks. HFMD is most commonly caused by coxsackievirus A16, which usually results in a mild, self-limiting disease with a few complications. HFMD is also caused by other enteroviruses, including enterovirus 71 (EV71), which in large outbreaks in southeastern Asia has been associated with serious complications in certain groups and may cause deaths.

HFMD mainly occurs among children under 10 years old. The usual period from infection to onset of symptoms is 3-7 days. The disease usually begins with fever, poor appetite, malaise, and frequently with a sore throat. One or 2 days after fever onset, painful sores develop in the mouth. They begin as small red spots that blister and then often become ulcers. They are usually located on the tongue, gums and inside of the cheeks. A non-itchy skin rash develops over 1-2 days with flat or raised red spots, some with blisters. The rash is usually located on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet and may also appear on the buttocks and/or genitalia. A person with HFMD may not have symptoms or may have only the rash or only mouth ulcers. In a small number of cases, children may experience a brief febrile illness, present with mixed neurological and respiratory symptoms and succumb rapidly from the disease.

HFMD virus is contagious, and infection is spread from person to person by direct contact with nose or throat discharges, saliva, fluid from blisters, or the stool of infected persons. Infected persons are most contagious during the 1st week of the illness, but the period of communicability can last for several weeks. HFMD is not transmitted from pets or other animals. HFMD should not be confused with the different disease in animals called foot-and-mouth disease.

Presently, there is no specific treatment available for HFMD. Patients should drink plenty of water or other liquids and may require treatment of the symptoms. Health care providers are advised to treat patients according to their symptoms and to refrain from using steroids.

Borrowed from Mod.ST's comment in the PRO/MBDS post Hand, foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam 20150120.3102437: "In the 29 Dec 2014 WHO hand-foot-mouth disease situation update, Viet Nam reports a decrease in the number of cases since week 39 (22-28 Sep 2014), but following the seasonal patterns. During week 51 (14-20 Dec 2014) there were 1412 new cases, a decrease of 56 cases (3.8 percent) compared to the previous week. As of 20 Dec 2014, cumulative cases reported in 2014: 79 485; cumulative deaths: 9 (http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/hfmd_biweekly_29dec2014.pdf?ua=1)". - Mod.LL
