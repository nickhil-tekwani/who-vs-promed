State officials say the livestock disease brucellosis has been found in elk in southwestern Montana's Ruby Mountains, the latest evidence the disease continues to slowly spread among wildlife in the Yellowstone region.

Two elk tested positive for exposure to the disease during recent sampling by Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks.

State Veterinarian Marty Zaluski says it's the 1st time brucellosis has been found in the mountain range east of Dillon. The 2 infected animals were among 100 elk being tested.

["Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease, and in many places around the world, it still causes severe infections in humans. Brucellosis also causes decreased milk production, weight loss, abortion, and infertility in cattle. For these reasons, beginning in the mid-1950s, great efforts were made to eliminate the disease from all livestock within the United States. While these efforts were successful at eliminating transmission within cattle nation-wide, sporadic transmission from wildlife to cattle in and around the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem has been on the increase. Brucellosis can result in serious financial burdens to cattle producers, potentially resulting in quarantine of a herd, increased testing and vaccination costs, and possible difficulty in trade with other states and countries.

Although the disease can cause abortions in elk, measurable population effects on population size or trend due to brucellosis have not been documented. However, the potential for transmission to livestock results in decreased acceptance of elk on private property which, in many areas, constitutes a large proportion of elk winter range. Historically, rates of exposure in elk (measured by blood tests) have been very low (below 2 percent in the early 1990's) and limited in distribution. Recent research and surveillance efforts have indicated that the prevalence and geographical distribution of the disease in elk is likely increasing. Brucellosis now exists in elk populations outside of the Greater Yellowstone Area. Hunters and game processors should take precautions (gloves and good hygiene) when handling reproductive and/or fetal material from hunter-harvested elk and bison."

Efforts to control brucellosis in the Greater Yellowstone Area has been ongoing for many years. Some years it seems to progress; some years it seems to be in regression. The perspective of progress seems to be on which side of the fence (wildlife defender vs. cattle owner) you find yourself on. There are challenges and feelings and even tempers on both sides of the fence. The low prevalence rate is encouraging, but the possible spread of the disease may not be encouraging. - Mod.TG
