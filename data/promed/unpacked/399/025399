Tularemia "probable" on Vineyard again
-----------------------------------------
The confirmation by state health officials this week [week of Mon 12 Jul
2004] of a Tisbury landscaper's "probable case" of tularemia, or "rabbit
fever," means that the potentially deadly bacterial disease has struck on
Martha's Vineyard for the 5th straight summer. The persistence of the
illness on the island has scientists baffled and locals on alert. "It's
high on everyone's radar screen over there, which is good," said state
health department veterinarian, Dr. Frederic Cantor.
The landscaper, who was sick earlier this summer [2004], and has since
fully recovered, had the characteristic high fever and cough associated
with the illness, but, was never sick enough to be admitted to the
hospital. He was treated with antimicrobial agents and has had no other
problems, Cantor said.
Tularemia can be contracted either through a bite by an infected dog tick,
by inhaling the highly infectious [organisms] from an infected animal, or,
through contact with the bacteria through an open cut or sore. The version
of the illness transmitted through a tick bite, or through an open sore,
creates a lesion on the skin, and, can also lead to swollen lymph nodes and
flu-like symptoms. The inhaled version, which is a bioterrorism concern,
causes a pneumonia-like condition that is more dangerous than the skin
version, Cantor said. Untreated, about 7 percent of victims die.
In August 2000, a Chilmark resident died of the pneumonic form of
tularemia. 10 other cases were successfully treated that summer. In 2001, 3
people, including a 4-year-old Newton boy, who was bitten by a tick,
[apparently on Martha's Vineyard - Mod.LL], came down with the disease,
and, later recovered. 2 cases were reported in 2002, and last year [2003],
there were 4 cases. Prior to 2000, Martha's Vineyard had not had an
outbreak since 1978, when 12 people were stricken.
No cases have been reported on Cape Cod, or Nantucket, in recent years, a
fact that has mystified some scientists who are now trying to figure out
why Martha's Vineyard is so hospitable to the disease. In 2001, the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta conducted a study in which
230 island residents were tested for tularemia antibodies, which the body
produces in the presence of the disease. Blood samples from 100 of the
residents who were not landscapers were taken, and all came back negative.
But, when 130 landscapers were tested, 9 percent tested positive for the
antibodies. None had been diagnosed with the disease, leading researchers
to believe that they had either fought the illness off without medication,
or, were being treated with antimicrobial agents for another reason when
they contracted it, according to Martha's Vineyard Hospital infectious
disease specialist Dr. Dennis Hoak.
The research led health officials to surmise that landscapers were
contracting the illness when they mowed over carcasses of infected rodents.
Vineyard landscapers now commonly use masks while mowing, Cantor said.
For the last 3 summers, Tufts University associate professor of infectious
disease, Sam Telford, has spent 3 days each month trapping small rodents to
see what kinds of ticks they are carrying, and, whether they are carrying
any disease. While rabbits are thought to be primary vectors of air-borne
tularemia, his research does not yet support that theory.
"Rabbits die within 7 days of getting tularemia. Their population (on the
island) has crashed, yet tularemia persists," he said. The notion that
landscapers are kicking up disease [organisms] from dead animals when they
mow over them is also in dispute, he said.
"In talking to the landscapers, these guys are outside all the time, and
they say 'we walk the properties first. Something as big as a (dead)
rabbit, we would notice.'"
Dog ticks appear to be a critical link in keeping tularemia in an
environment, Telford said. They are found throughout the island, and,
unlike the smaller deer tick, which dies in the dryness and heat of a beach
environment, they can thrive in the dune grass, and, even on the beach, he
said. He and his staff have found that tularemia is found in ticks in
specific areas of Martha's Vineyard.

[The significance of this posting is not that the 1st case of tularemia --
a category A bioterrorism infection -- has occurred on Martha's Vineyard in
2004, but, rather, that the tick, instead of the rabbit, may be the
transmitter. Since pneumonic tularemia seems to be the common presentation
on the island (rather than the ulceroglandular form), perhaps the
aerosolization of lawn-mower-minced Dermacentor ticks is involved in
transmission. - Mod.LL]
