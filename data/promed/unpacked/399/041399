An outbreak of [due to] _Listeria_ linked to recalled bags of garden salad has killed 2 people and sickened 17 others in 13 states, according to federal health officials.

The outbreak is tied to packaged salads produced by Dole and sold under 11 brands, including Dole, Kroger, and Nature's Promise, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday [1 Feb 2022] in an update of its investigation.

Dole Fresh Vegetables at the end of October [2022] recalled salad products sold in 10 states after a sample tested positive for _Listeria monocytogenes_, an organism that can cause serious and potentially deadly infections. The company has since recalled additional products containing iceberg lettuce produced by contaminated equipment.

Recalled salad products from a Dole plant in Springfield, Ohio, was distributed in Alabama, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, Nebraska, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wisconsin. All contained a best-if-used-by date between [22 Dec 2021 and 9 Jan 2022], according to a January [2022] notice posted by the Food and Drug Administration.

Recalled salad products from another facility in Soledad, California, were sold in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. All contained a best-if-used-by date between [23 Dec 2021 and 8 Jan 2022].

In late December [2021], the company also recalled packaged salads processed at facilities in Bessemer City, North Carolina, and Yuma, Arizona, due to _Listeria_ concerns.

The CDC is also investigating another _Listeria_ outbreak linked to recalled packaged salads produced by Fresh Express. The agency reports 10 hospitalizations and 1 death in that separate outbreak.

Listeriosis is a serious infection usually caused by eating contaminated food, afflicting an estimated 1600 people in the U.S. each year and killing about 260 people, according to the CDC.

[The CDC has been investigating 2 separate _Listeria_ multistate outbreaks involving packaged salads. One outbreak concerns Fresh Express-packed salads and the other outbreak, Dole-packed salads. ProMED has posted reports on both of these outbreaks; See ProMED posts: Listeriosis - USA (07): fatal, packaged salad mix, recall, alert 20211223.8700448) and Listeriosis - USA (08): fatal, 2 outbreaks, packaged salad, recall, alert 20211225.8700469.

Please see the prior ProMED post (Listeriosis - USA (07): fatal, packaged salad mix, recall, alert 20211223.8700448) for my moderator comments on _Listeria_ outbreaks.

The news report above is an updated report on the outbreak linked to packaged salads containing _Listeria_-contaminated iceberg lettuce produced by Dole. The Dole listeriosis outbreak involved 17 cases, including 13 hospitalizations and 2 deaths, between 2014 and 30 Dec 2021 in 13 US states. Salads containing the tainted lettuce from multiple Dole processing facilities were shipped throughout the US and to several provinces in Canada. The source for this outbreak was traced to equipment used in the harvesting of the raw iceberg lettuce that was contaminated with the outbreak strain of _L. monocytogenes_. The identification of the outbreak strain was based on whole genome sequencing.

The citation and abridged report of the Dole outbreak from the FDA follow:
Citation: Outbreak Investigation of _Listeria monocytogenes_: Dole Packaged Salad (December 2021) https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/outbreak-investigation-listeria-monocytogenes-dole-packaged-salad-december-2021.

"FDA, along with CDC and state and local partners, is investigating a multistate outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infections linked to Dole packaged leafy greens by epidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback data. According to the CDC, as of [1 Feb 2022,] 17 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ have been reported from 13 states. Illnesses started on dates ranging from [16 Aug 2014 to 30 Dec 2021] (one case occurred in 2014 and the remaining cases occurred between 2018 and 2021). CDC investigated this outbreak in 2019 and 2020 but was unable to gather enough data to identify the source in the past. CDC reopened the investigation in November 2021 after reports of new illnesses.

"FDA sent investigators to multiple Dole processing facilities to conduct on-site inspections while at the same time Dole initiated their own investigation. On [22 Dec 2021], Dole voluntarily recalled all products and brands from their Bessemer City, [North Carolina], and Yuma, [Arizona], facilities. On [7 Jan 2022], as a result of continued investigations, Dole issued a voluntary recall of additional products after Dole detected the presence of _L. monocytogenes_ on equipment used in the harvesting of the raw iceberg lettuce also used in finished products processed in the Dole Springfield, [Ohio], and Soledad, [California], facilities. These products were shipped throughout the United States and several provinces in Canada. FDA analyzed the positive sample collected by Dole from the harvesting equipment. Results from FDA's WGS [whole genome sequencing] analysis showed that the strain of _L. monocytogenes_ found on the harvesting equipment matches the strain causing illnesses in this outbreak.

"In addition to this outbreak of listeriosis linked to packaged salads produced by Dole, FDA, and CDC are currently investigating a separate _Listeria_ outbreak linked to packaged salads produced by Fresh Express. These investigations are ongoing and additional information will be provided as it becomes available.

"Recommendation
---------------
"FDA recommends that anyone who received recalled products use extra vigilance in cleaning and sanitizing any surfaces and containers that may have come in contact with these products to reduce the risk of cross-contamination. _Listeria_ can survive at refrigeration temperatures and can easily spread to other foods and surfaces.

"All recalled products are now past their "Best if Used By" dates of [30 Nov 2021 to 9 Jan 2022. If consumers have expired recalled Dole salads in their homes, they should throw them away. The initial list of recalled products [https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/dole-fresh-vegetables-announces-voluntary-recall-salads-processed-its-bessemer-city-nc-and-yuma-az] and the 2nd list of recalled products are available on FDA's website [https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/dole-fresh-vegetables-inc-announces-voluntary-recall-certain-salads-processed-its-springfield-oh-and]."
