The first case of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) on an Essex farm outside the
Brentwood exclusion zone has been confirmed.
The Ministry of Agriculture says cases were found at a pig farm at Canewdon
near Rochford following checks by veterinarians.
It's some 20 miles away from the abattoir near Brentwood where the outbreak
was first discovered early this week.
Mr Brown later emerged briefly from the ministry to make a statement to the
media. He said he believed MAFF officials had traced the source of the FMD
outbreak but said he was unable to confirm anything at this time. Standing
on the steps of the ministry, he said discussions were continuing within
the government and said a "comprehensive statement" would be made later today.
"I am not able to take the matter forward now," he added: "There is nothing
to add to that."

Agriculture Minister Nick Brown is this afternoon expected to order a
7-day ban on all movements of livestock within Britain. The news came as
Government scientists closed in on the source of the FMD outbreak.
Peter Kingwill, chairman of the Livestock Auctioneers' Association, said:
"We have been in meetings with Mr Brown this morning and there is an
agreement there could be a 7-day ban on all livestock movements. We expect
him to make a formal announcement this afternoon." Investigators were
continuing to focus on the possibility a pig farm in Northumberland it may
have been responsible for spreading the disease.
The potent virus increased its grip on Britain's farming industry today
as animals at the Northumberland farm and a third one in Essex were
confirmed to be suffering from FMD.
Scotland also suffered its first "suspected" cases of FMD as investigators
converged on a number of sites.
In England, officials at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
(MAFF) said FMD had now been confirmed at the farm in Heddon-on-the-Wall,
Northumberland, thought to be the possible source for the outbreak.
Mr Brown emerged from the Ministry of Agriculture shortly after midday to
say he believed MAFF officials had traced the source of the outbreak but
he was still unable to confirm anything at this stage.
He said discussions were continuing within the Government and a
"comprehensive statement" would be made later today.
Earlier, A MAFF spokesman said animals at the Heddon-on-the-Wall farm may
have had the disease for some time. Fears over how widespread the disease
may now be increased with the announcement that there were now confirmed
cases at 5 different farm businesses.
The outbreak was first detected in pigs at the Cheale Meats abattoir in
Little Warley, Essex, before passing to animals at an adjacent farm in
the same family-owned complex.
Cases at another farm in Great Warley, Essex, have also been confirmed.
Investigations were also ongoing at an estimated 600 farms which are
believed to have supplied the Essex abattoir with live animals in recent
weeks.
Officials warned that even if the Heddon-on-the-Wall farm is established
to be the source of the disease, there may still be some way to go before
the disease is contained. "We are not just looking for the source but for
other cases as well," added the MAFF spokesman. "Establishing the source
would be of great help but it would certainly not be the end of this
problem."
In Northern Ireland, Stormont agriculture minister Brid Rodgers said
tests on 3 farms having supplied pigs to the Cheale Meats abattoir had
found no trace of FMD.
The lorry which transported the pigs to the abattoir has now been taken
out of circulation. Shadow agriculture minister Tim Yeo called for the
quarantine areas to be policed to prevent the disease spreading further.

In Northern Ireland, Stormont agriculture minister Brid Rodgers said
tests on 3 farms having supplied pigs to the Cheale Meats abattoir in
Essex, where the deadly disease was detected, had found no trace of FMD.
She told the Assembly's agriculture committee laboratory tests were still
being carried out and preliminary results should be available later
today.
The lorry which transported the pigs to the abattoir has now been taken
out of circulation.
Investigations were continuing at an estimated 600 farms throughout
Britain which are all known to have supplied Cheale Meats in recent
weeks.
It also emerged today that a pig farm in Aberdeenshire is among several in
Scotland which have been scrutinized. The Scottish Executive said checks
had been carried out at a number of farms but there were no confirmed cases
of FMD north of the border.
Agriculture Minister Nick Brown today canceled a visit to West Yorkshire
as the crisis deepened. Mr Brown was due to hold a series of meetings
with representatives from the National Farmers' Union, state vets and
ministry officials in London.
A MAFF spokesman said Mr Brown had canceled the visit to Slaithwaite
Civic Hall in favor of a second day of talks over the outbreak of FMD.
Elsewhere, 2 Gloucestershire farms were known to have shut their gates to
visitors after a suspected outbreak of FMD disease in the county.
Staff at Robinswood Hill Rarebreeds and St James City farms in Tredworth,
Gloucester, said they were anxious to stop the highly infectious disease
being spread by human contact.
Ministry of Agriculture is also carrying out blood and tissue tests on 18
pigs at Woodchester Park farm near Stroud.

Summary of Animal Health Act 1981, Foot and Mouth Disease Order 1983
(3.35pm Feb 23)
The statutory notices for disease control purposes are as follows:
Form A.
A notice signed by an inspector authorized for the purpose under the Act
declaring an Infected Place where there is reasonable grounds for supposing
that disease exists or has existed within the previous 56 days. Service of
this notice invokes the rules to be observed on an infected place to
prevent the spread of disease.
Form B.
A notice withdrawing Form A restrictions. May only be signed by a
veterinary inspector.
Form C.
This is a certificate of suspected disease signed by a veterinary Inspector
certifying there are reasonable grounds for suspecting the premises to be
affected with FMD. The signing of this notice makes it unlawful for any
person to move an animal out of the area lying within an 8km radius of the
infected place.
Form D.
A notice signed by an Inspector authorized for the purpose under the Act to
the owner or person in charge of animals exposed to infection or to the
occupier of premises where such animals are situated, imposing movement
restrictions. This notice is used to restrict movements of animals from
premises that may have had direct or indirect exposure to infection.
Form E.
This is a notice signed by an Inspector authorized for the purpose under
the Act withdrawing Form D restrictions.
Farmers may press for a national ban on movement (3.10m, Feb 23)
Following an exploratory initiative yesterday by the National Pig
Association, the NFU has today been in discussion with the Ministry of
Agriculture to look at what further action can be taken to halt the
spread of FMD.
NFU President Ben Gill said the industry was looking at further measures,
including a possible ban on moving animals on or off any farm in the
country for 7 days. He said: "In light of the way the disease is
developing and the further outbreak in the north of England, it is clear
that more drastic measures will be needed on top of the current
restriction zones. We have been in constant contact with MAFF and will
support them in any action they take along these lines. There will be
many issues which will need clarifying if this action happens but we all
know that we must do whatever is necessary to halt the spread of this
disease."
Disinfection guidelines
----------
MLC UK Foot and Mouth Update 2.
Many farmers, abattoir owners, market operators, hauliers are already
aware of the need and carry out proper disinfection measures to prevent
the spread of disease as essential elements of farm assurance schemes.
Good practice ensures the correct disinfectant is used at the correct
strength but equally important requires the active ingredients are not
prevented from working by the presence of organic matter.
The efficiency of many disinfectants is reduced by the presence of dirt
and feces adhering to the surfaces. Thorough cleaning and washing of the
surfaces of vehicles, boots and implements should be carried out before
applying the disinfectant.
FMD virus is more resistant to the iodophores, quaternary ammonium
compounds, hypochlorites and phenols in the presence of organic matter
such as dirt, grime and feces. The virus is readily inactivated by low
concentrations of citric acid (0.2%), sodium carbonate or washing soda
(4%) and sodium hydroxide (2%).
These compounds are sometimes used to disinfect implements and surfaces
on farms infected with FMD and are available from many chemical
suppliers. But the thorough cleaning of surfaces should still be carried
out even when using these compounds. MAFF produce a list of approved
disinfectants and their dilution rates for use in the control of FMD:
www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/fmd/disinfectant/htm
For detailed advice on the control of the spread of notifiable diseases
such as FMD you should contact the local Divisional Veterinary Manager of
the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food.

Officials of the British Agriculture Ministry said Friday they may have
found the source of the Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) outbreak at a farm
in Northumberland, northeast England.
Pigs have been slaughtered at Burnside Farm in Heddon-on-the-Wall after
a 5-mile animal exclusion zone was established Thursday night.

The Scottish Executive was cited as saying on Friday it had discovered a
possible case of foot and mouth disease (FMD) on a pig farm in
Aberdeenshire, raising fears the highly contagious disease had spread
throughout Britain, adding in a statement, "A possible case of FMD is
being investigated by the state veterinary service on a pig farm in Fyvie
in Aberdeenshire. Movement restrictions have been applied to the farm and
a standstill notice is in effect for an 8km radius around farm."
A 35-mile car journey turned into a 5 hour wait in wind and snow for a man
who collided with a deer in a FMD exclusion area early today. Service
engineer Steven Ware-Lane was driving on the A414 at Ongar, Essex, at
6.20am when a deer ran into his path. He swerved but could not avoid the
animal which died in the accident. Then an AA [Automobile Association man
called out to recover the car was also stranded as his breakdown truck may
also have been infected.
Efforts to prevent a British outbreak of FMD from spreading to Ireland
intensifies on Friday as the army was called in to reinforce police
patrols along the northern border. Ireland has mounted a vast defensive
operation, setting up check-points at all points of entry into the
country to enforce a ban on animal imports from Britain and Northern
Ireland.
Army spokesman Kieran McDaid was cited as saying several army units were
being deployed to the border with Northern Ireland on Friday morning to
support the police operation, adding, "Over 300 hundred troops will be
involved on a 24-hour basis, starting from now. It's a very difficult job
sealing up something like that."
With as many as 292 approved and unapproved crossings, the 242-mile
border with the northern province is seen as particularly vulnerable to
the highly contagious livestock disease. During the night, police said
they had stopped 3 lorries carrying meat products from crossing the
border into Ireland.

[Northumberland is hill country with inhabited valleys and sheep and
cattle on the empty uplands. Any acute and 'chronically' affected pig
farm would have presented a serious risk to surrounding cattle and sheep
farms from the beginning. How come they were not noted with disease even
if the sick pigs were missed? It raises the question: are animal care
takers not reporting or treating sick animals, or have the veterinarians
in practice forgotten how bovine FMD looks?
In an earlier post, the strain of FMD was identified as type O, the
pandemic variety. If it is the "Pandemic Type O Strain", this widens the
possible opportunities for entry into the UK. It also raises the question
as to where else in Western Europe it might be at this time. - Mod.TG
