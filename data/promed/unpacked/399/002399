Kosice-okolie district (south-eastern Slovakia) and 1 case in Levice

Emergency phytosanitary measures to eradicate the disease and to hinder any
further spread have been taken, and monitoring of the infected regions has
been intensified as required by the Slovak law currently in force.
The situation of Ea in Slovakia can be described as follows: Present, first
