The type of bird flu found in turkeys on a Suffolk farm is the
virulent H5N1 strain, according to government vets.

The virus was discovered on Sunday [11 Nov 2007] at Redgrave Park
Farm near Diss, where all 6500 birds, most of them turkeys, are being
slaughtered.

A 3 km (2 mi) protection zone and a 10 km (6 mi) surveillance zone
have been set up and the farm is co-operating with vets. Acting chief
veterinary officer Fred Landeg made the announcement at a press
conference in London.

All birds at the affected premises -- including approximately 5000
turkeys, 1000 ducks, and 500 geese -- will be slaughtered.

Police officers are at the entrance to the farm, and vehicles are
being sprayed with a jet hose.

The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said
some 10 percent of birds in one shed at the farm had died during one
night.

Mr Landeg said there was "still some uncertainty" over the situation.
"We are at a very early stage of the investigation," he added. "The
initial sequence data suggests that it's closely related to outbreaks
in the Czech Republic and Germany, which does suggest a possible wild
bird source. However, at this stage we are looking with an open mind
as to the origin and all potential sources of the origin will be
investigated."

Mr Landeg also said there was a lake at the affected site with a
number of wild fowl on it.

"We are still at a very early stage of the investigation and no 2
outbreaks of the disease are ever the same.

"This will not be a quick exercise. This is a particularly
challenging site and our priority is to adhere to strict
bio-security, and the health and safety of staff on site is paramount.

"It is extremely important that poultry keepers, particularly in the
locality, are vigilant and on the lookout for disease, and report it
quickly. In addition we want every poultry keeper in the area to be
well aware of bio-security."

Earlier, Mr Landeg had said the risk of bird flu spreading was
increased during the autumn months because of wild bird migration.

The affected birds were free-range -- meaning they had access to the
outdoors and may have been of greater risk of catching the disease.

There was a H5N1 outbreak at a turkey farm, also in Suffolk, in
February [2007] [see commentary].

The BBC's Andrew Sinclair, who is at the farm in Suffolk, said large
trucks and gas canisters had been moved on to the premises earlier in
preparation for the cull. It is expected that all the birds will be
gassed and then put in sealed containers.

Officials said further local surveillance work would happen before
deciding on any culls on neighbouring farms.

Heather Peck, Defra's regional operations manager for animal health,
said: "The top priority is to get controls in place, to inform people
of the controls in place and that's largely done electronically these
days.

"The immediate priority for us here is both to cull the affected
birds on the infected premises and to establish any possible contact
or any potential traces of movement between those premises, or
related premises or premises in the immediate vicinity."

Environment secretary Hilary Benn is due to make a statement to the
House of Commons on Tuesday afternoon [13 Nov 2007].

H5N1 avian influenza confirmed in poultry
-----------------------------------------
Following further test results from the Veterinary Laboratories
Agency (VLA) the acting chief veterinary officer has confirmed that
the strain of avian influenza present at the Infected Premises near
Diss is the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain. Further characterisation
of the virus is in progress, which may give an indication of the
origin of the strain.

Local authorities and Animal Health are enforcing a 3 km (2 mi)
Protection Zone, a 10 km (6 mi) Surveillance Zone and a wider
Restricted Zone covering the whole of Suffolk and most of Norfolk
around the Infected Premises. In these zones, movement restrictions
will be imposed and poultry must be isolated from wild birds. In
addition, it has been announced that the national general licence on
bird gatherings has been revoked, and bird shows and pigeon racing
will not be permitted for the time being.

A full epidemiological investigation and tracings of any dangerous
contacts are underway and all possible sources of the outbreak will
be investigated.

Fred Landeg, the acting chief veterinary officer said: "We are
keeping all poultry keepers registered on the Great Britain Poultry
register informed of the developing situation and I must stress how
important it is for all poultry keepers in the locality to be
extremely vigilant. They must report any suspicions of disease to
their Animal Health office immediately and practice the highest
levels of biosecurity.

"We have faced H5N1 once already this year [2007], but there is still
significant uncertainty surrounding this outbreak. Swift reporting of
disease and stringent biosecurity is essential to controlling this
disease and we are working to our established contingency plans.

The European Commission has been informed of this development.

[The distance between the location of the current outbreak, at Diss,
and the previous, February 2007 outbreak, which affected turkeys in
Upper Holton, Halesworth, Suffolk (red circle) -- is about 16 miles
(25 km); see map at
<http://www.multimap.com/maps/?&t=l&map=52.364791.52224|14|4&loc=GB:52.36479:1.52224:14&dp=841#t=l&map=52.36258,1.39881|11|4&dp=841&loc=GB:52.36479:1.52224:14>.


Mr Landeg's statement that the initial sequence data (of the current
H5N1 strain) suggests close relatedness to outbreaks in the Czech
Republic and Germany, deserves attention. A very high similarity
(99.96 percent) at the whole genome level was revealed in February
(2007) between the H5N1 viruses found in Suffolk and the Hungarian
outbreaks. These results were said to indicate that the viruses were
essentially identical (see
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/latest/2007/animal-0213.htm>).

The relatively short distance between the 2 foci in Suffolk is
intriguing; it will be interesting to obtain information on the
similarity level between the H5N1 strains isolated from them. The
possible involvement of wild avians -- to which Mr Landeg referred --
deserves further investigation. - Mod.AS]
