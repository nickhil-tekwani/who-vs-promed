We have had four laboratory-confirmed rabid bobcats in New York State
during the 90s, all of raccoon rabies variant origin. Each had a history of
clinical signs, and these signs ranged from a lack of fear and avoidance of
humans to open aggression to humans and domestic animals. The raccoon
rabies outbreak in New York has resulted in spill-over cases to a wide
range of wild mammals not commonly associated with rabies cases, including
32 whitetail deer, 11 coyotes, 8 opossum, 6 beaver, 4 bobcats, 1 muskrat, 1
otter, 1 fisher, and 1 black bear. The black bear case occurred in 1999,
and the animal showed a range of abnormal behavior, and like the bobcats in
the previous posts from Vermont and Michigan, repeatedly tried to get into
a home - actually, this rabid bear succeeded in opening a door by turning
the handle with it's mouth and entered the home before being chased off and
eventually shot! The rabies virus variant was typed by monoclonal antibody
panel as the raccoon rabies variant, and rabies antigen also was disclosed
in submaxillary salivary gland of the bear by immunofluorescence.
