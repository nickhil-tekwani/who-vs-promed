The Department of Health (DOH) - Calabarzon (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, Quezon) on Tuesday [18 May 2021] reported an uptick in recorded cases of acute bloody diarrhea in various provinces of the region.

To avert a possible surge, DOH Regional Director Eduardo Janairo said that they are currently monitoring the increase in the number of cases in the province of Quezon and Rizal. Janairo said that 19 were recorded in Quezon and 13 in Rizal. "The regional office is continuing its disease surveillance and is directly in contact with the local health officials in the provinces," Janairo said.

The Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit has recorded a total of 44 acute bloody diarrhea cases from 1 Jan to 15 May [2021].

Age of cases ranged from one year to 57 years old. Majority of the cases were female with 23 (52%), and most of the cases belonged to the one-to-10-year-old age group. The province with the highest cases of acute bloody diarrhea was recorded in Quezon with 19, followed by Rizal with 13, Laguna with 8, and Cavite with 4. Janairo warned that diarrhea should not be ignored, saying the ailment may result in death.

Diarrhea has been noted to be common during the dry season. A person suffering with an acute bloody diarrhea experiences abdominal pain, dehydration, and watery stool. Janairo said that bloody diarrhea is caused by _Escherichia coli_ that can be found on food and in the environment. "It is very important that we wash our hands before and after eating and make sure that the water you drink is clean," Janairo said.

[Calabarzon, formally known as the Southern Tagalog Mainland, is an administrative region in the Philippines, designated as Region IV-A. The region comprises 5 provinces: Batangas, Cavite, Laguna, Quezon, and Rizal and one highly urbanized city, Lucena. The region is the most populous region in the Philippines according to the Philippine Statistics Authority, having over 14.4 million inhabitants in 2015, and is also the country's 2nd-most densely populated after the National Capital Region."

"The name of the region is an acronym of its 5 component provinces: Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and Quezon."

Acute bloody diarrhea, when occurring in an outbreak, is classically caused by _Shigella_, but Shiga-toxin-producing enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ may also be at work here. Clinically, the 2 infections ought to be distinguishable even before culture reports are available, as shigellosis generally presents with high fever and mucoid, bloody diarrhea, whereas EHEC presents with little or no fever with significant abdominal pain and watery diarrhea, which may become bloody after several days. Shigellosis (the classical cause of bacillary dysentery) is often treated with antimicrobials, whereas EHEC is not, as treatment may increase the risk of hemolytic-uremic syndrome. - Mod.LL
