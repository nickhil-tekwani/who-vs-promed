Health Ministry reports this year's 1st case of West Nile virus
-----------------------------------------------
The Health Ministry reported Saturday [30 Jul 2005] the discovery of
Israel's 1st case of West Nile virus this year [2005].
Senior health officials say that the fact that this year's [2005] 1st
appearance of the virus came in July probably means that chances of a wider
outbreak are small [see comment]. However, the ministry called on the
public to take measures to prevent mosquito bites.
Humans contract the virus through the bites. Symptoms include a fever,
headaches, throat aches, rashes and occasionally muscle pain. Neurological
complications of the virus can cause irreversible damage and occasionally
death, primarily for elderly patients.
According to the ministry's announcement, a 37-year-old woman was
hospitalized at Petah Tikva's Beilinson Hospital on 15 Jul 2005, suffering
from a high fever, rash, headaches and a stiff neck.
By the end of the week, lab [National Centre for Arboviruses, Central
Virology Laboratory, Public Health Laboratories, Ministry of Health]
results revealed the woman had been infected with the West Nile virus. She
was released on 24 Jul 2005 and is in good condition.
In 2000, Israel saw an outbreak of the virus, with 400 infections that
resulted in 29 deaths. Since then, there has been a substantial decline in
cases of the virus: 2001 saw 14 cases and 2 deaths, and in 2002, 7 people
were infected and one died. [For later years, see comment].
The Health Ministry instructed the public Saturday [30 Jul 2005] to stock
up on mosquito repellents and to treat standing water sources in homes and
their surroundings.
The ministry placed on the Environment Ministry and local authorities the
responsibility for dealing with larger standing water and waste sources,
both of which encourage mosquitoes to multiply.

[The (unofficial) figures on the number of human WNF cases in recent years
are: 2003, 40 confirmed cases, 4 died; 2004, 10 confirmed cases, one died.
The somewhat optimistic prediction on the expected number of cases this
year (2005) might be based on the accumulated data, showing that an early
commencement of the West Nile fever (WNF) season might develop into an
epidemic. In 2003, the 1st case was diagnosed in May, while in 2004, with
the 1st case in September, there was a smaller number of cases. However,
most cases of WNF occur in Israel during the period August-October.
West Nile Fever (in animals) has been recently added to OIE's list of
notifiable diseases (category of multiple species diseases). - Mod.AS]
