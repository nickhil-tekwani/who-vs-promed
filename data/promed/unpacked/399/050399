I am uncertain whether there has been any connection made between the
fresh produce origins and outbreaks in birds. In New Zealand, we had
a series of human infections which we believed were associated with
an outbreak (and deaths) in birds carrying a strain of Typhimurium (I
think it was DT 128).
We found that the transmission was probably occurring from direct
contact with bird carcasses as well as materials contaminated with
bird feces. In addition the risk of infection and spread to new
areas could be predicted by the increased incidence of bird deaths in
the new areas.
Unfortunately over time we believe some of the bird species became
carriers -- with lower mortality -- presumably a slight variant
strain that was better tolerated.
I think the information might be useful as another risk factor that
could be looked for/considered as a contamination source in the
regions producing the affected produce.

[ProMED thanks Mark Bosson for this contribution. Human
salmonellosis occurs from birds, but usually it is linked to poultry
or their eggs (chickens, ducks and turkeys) rather than wild birds. A
cluster associated with dissection of owl pellets has been posted this year.
In this vein, we have posted in 2000 and 2001 a cluster of _S._
Typhimurium human and wild bird cases from New Zealand which was DT
(Definitive Type) 160. This outbreak may be what he refers to. The
following is an edited version of Mod. MPP's discussion regarding the outbreak:
"_S._ Typhimurium type 160 is not a common isolate in human
infections. This article reports on an outbreak of _S._ Typhimurium
type 160 in humans in association with an outbreak of _S._
Typhimurium type 160 in sparrows in New Zealand. This news article
suggests that _S._ Typhimurium is now circulating in the human
population independent of contact with infected birds.
A review of the literature revealed articles on the association of
human salmonellosis and birds. One prior outbreak is described in the
third reference. The Veterinary health unit in New Zealand in a 12
Feb 2000 publication
(<http://www.gov.nf.ca/agric/pubfact/salmonella.htm>) mentioned an
outbreak of _S._ Typhimurium type 160 in songbirds in Central
Newfoundland, Canada in February-March 1999 as part of an alert for
bird feeders in the country.
In addition, a paper from the Veterinary Science Division, Avian
Health Unit, Ayr UK (SAC Veterinarian Science Unit)
(<http://www.bvpa.org.uk/papers/penn01wb.htm>) mentioned that _S._
Typhimurium DT160 caused outbreaks of mortality in house sparrows in
New Zealand in 1999/2000. This paper also mentioned that there was
evidence of disease in humans (including one death), and in young
farmed ducks and quail, dogs and cats, deer, and horses.
