FDA Approves 2nd-Generation Smallpox Vaccine
-----------------------------------------------------
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has
licensed a new vaccine to protect against
smallpox, a highly contagious disease with the
potential to be used as a deadly bioterror weapon.
The vaccine, ACAM2000, is intended for the
inoculation of people at high risk of exposure to
smallpox and could be used to protect individuals
and populations during a bioterrorist attack. It
will be included in the Center for Disease
Control and Prevention's (CDC) Strategic National
Stockpile of medical supplies.
A worldwide vaccination program eradicated
smallpox in the population. The last case of
naturally occurring smallpox in the USA was in
1949 and the last case in the world was reported
in Somalia in 1977. Known stockpiles of the virus
are kept only in 2 approved labs in the United
States and Russia. The CDC considers it a
Category A agent, meaning it presents one of the
greatest potential threats for harming public health.
Smallpox is caused by the variola virus, a virus
that emerged in human populations thousands of
years ago. It spreads through close contact with
infected individuals or contaminated objects,
such as bedding or clothing. There is no
FDA-approved treatment for smallpox and the only prevention is vaccination.
"The licensure of ACAM2000 supplements our
current supply of smallpox vaccine, meaning we
are more prepared to protect the population
should the virus ever be used as a weapon," said
Jesse L. Goodman, M.D., M.P.H., director of FDA's
Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.
"This vaccine is manufactured using modern cell
culture technology allowing rapid and large scale
production of a vaccine with consistent product quality."
The symptoms of smallpox typically began with
high fever, head and body aches. A rash followed
that spread and progressed to raised bumps and
pus-filled blisters that crusted, scabbed, and
fell off after about 3 weeks, leaving a pitted
scar. The fatality rate historically was about 30
percent, according to the CDC.
ACAM2000 is made using a pox virus called
vaccinia, which is related to but different from
the virus that causes smallpox. The vaccine
contains live vaccinia virus and works by causing
a mild infection that stimulates an immune
response that effectively protects against
smallpox without actually causing the disease.
The vaccine is derived from the only other
smallpox vaccine licensed by FDA, Dryvax,
approved in 1931 and now in limited supply
because it is no longer manufactured.
Although smallpox vaccination ended in the United
States in 1972 because it was no longer needed
for prevention, the U.S. military resumed
vaccination of at-risk personnel in 1999, after
concluding that the disease posed a potential bioterrorism threat.
"Smallpox could be a particularly dangerous
biological threat to us that would kill or
debilitate a high percentage of the population,"
said Rear Adm. W. Craig Vanderwagen, M.D.,
assistant secretary for preparedness and
response, U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services. "The licensing of ACAM2000 will make us
better prepared as a nation because it provides
an important, effective tool for protecting first
responders and individuals with a high risk of
exposure from this potentially lethal disease."
ACAM2000 was studied in 2 populations: those who
had never been vaccinated for smallpox and those
who had received smallpox vaccination many years
earlier. The percentage of unvaccinated persons
who developed a successful immunization reaction
was similar to that of Dryvax. ACAM2000 also was
found to be acceptable as a booster in those
previously vaccinated for smallpox.
Because ACAM2000 contains live vaccinia virus,
care must be taken to prevent the virus from
spreading from the inoculation site to other
parts of the body, and to other individuals.
To minimize known risks, the vaccine licensing is
subject to a Risk Minimization Action Plan
(RiskMAP). The RiskMAP requires providers of the
vaccine and patients to be educated about these
and other risks. The RiskMAP also requires
patient education through an FDA-approved
Medication Guide for those who receive the vaccine.
The Medication Guide explains the proper care of
the vaccination site and provides information
about serious side effects that can occur with
ACAM2000. In studies, about 1 in 175 healthy
adults who received smallpox vaccine for the 1st
time developed inflammation and swelling of the
heart and/or surrounding tissues (myocarditis
and/or pericarditis). Of the 10 affected adults,
4 had no symptoms and at the end of the study,
all but one had their symptoms resolve.
ACAM2000 is manufactured by Acambis Inc. of
Cambridge, England and Cambridge, MA. Dryvax was
made by Wyeth Laboratories Inc. based in Madison, NJ

Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) Briefing Document on
ACAM2000, presented to the FDA, dated 18 April

(A 72 page document).
As this moderator had contributed more than her
allotted "2 cents" on the discussions surrounding
the risk benefit of a widespread smallpox
vaccination initiative attempted several years
ago in the United States, (having "sowed her
oats" on assisting in developing an adverse
events following vaccinations monitoring system
for the USA back in 1979/1980), the findings of
the above referenced study document with respect
to adverse events were of extreme interest. The
actual discussions can be found on pages
42-53. To summarize, the ACAM2000 was compared
to the presently used Dryvax vaccine. According
to the document, "The Safety Population consists
of all subjects who received vaccination during
the clinical trials. The safety profile of
ACAM2000 was evaluated in a total of 2983
subjects (1307 vaccinia-naive and 1676 previously
vaccinated) in doses ranging from 3.4�06 to
2.2�08 PFU/mL [plaque forming units per
milliliter]. A total of 868 subjects (368
vaccinia-naive and 500 previously vaccinated)
received single cutaneous doses of Dryvax vaccine
administered at doses ranging from 1.0�08 to 1.6�08 PFU/mL."
"There were no fatalities during any clinical
study of ACAM2000. Other [serious adverse events]
SAEs occurred rarely (less than 1 percent) with
ACAM2000, with the most commonly reported SAEs
being myocarditis and pregnancy (considered an
SAE due to the potential risk of congenital
infection, although no cases of congenital infection were documented)."
With respect to myocarditis, "10 cases, 7 in
subjects treated with ACAM2000 (5.73 events per
thousand vaccinations) and 3 in subjects treated
with Dryvax (10.38 events per thousand
vaccinations), were reported in a total
vaccinia-na� population of 1675 subjects, for a combined calculated
incidence of 5.97 cases per thousand
vaccinations. ....All subjects who experienced
myocarditis were previously na� to vaccinia; no
cases were detected in previously vaccinated
subjects. ...Although the myocarditis incidence
rate was higher in the Dryvax group (10.38 events
per thousand vaccinations) there was no
statistically significant difference from the
ACAM2000 group (5.73 events per thousand vaccinations)."
"Serious cardiac events other than myocarditis
were reported within 30 days after vaccination
for 4 previously vaccinated subjects, and
included single reports of atrial fibrillation,
chest discomfort, chest pain, and coronary artery
disease. All 3 events, except coronary artery
disease, were considered to have a possible
relationship to ACAM2000 as determined by the clinical investigator."
With respect to pregnancy related events, the
above report mentioned 5 subjects who became
pregnant within 30 days after vaccination. Of
these 5, there were "2 spontaneous abortions, one
live birth, and one elective termination; the
remaining subject was lost to follow-up. There
were no reports of fetal vaccinia, congenital
anomalies, or birth defects. Of the 2 spontaneous
abortions, one was considered to be unrelated to
study vaccine. In the other case, neither
smallpox vaccination nor VIG [vaccinia immune
globulin] administration could be ruled out as risk factors."
The report concludes: "No other SAEs historically
associated with smallpox vaccine, including GV
[generalized vaccinia], fetal vaccinia, ocular
vaccinia, PVE [Post-vaccinial encephalopathy], PV
[Progressive vaccinia], erythema multiforme, or
EV [Eczema vaccinatum] [, were reported with
ACAM2000, although the studies were not powered
to detect these SAEs historically associated with
smallpox vaccine. Other adverse reactions noted
after recent vaccination programs (including
erythema multiforme major/ Stevens-Johnson
syndrome, dilated cardiomyopathy, and contact
transmission of vaccinia) have not been observed with ACAM2000."
It should be noted at this point that a total
study population of less than 3000 participants
will most likely not identify those serious
adverse events (SAEs) that occur at a rate of 1
per 10 000 or lower (0.01 percent). Hence, any
conclusions re: the acceptable safety level of
the ACAM2000 have to be qualified by the fact
that the study sample was not large enough to detect all SAEs.
To put things into perspective, studies on rates
of adverse events following receipt of the
previously available vaccine (Dryvax and other
predecessors) were conducted in 1968 (see refs
listed below). In the 1968 studies, rashes
diagnosed as generalized vaccinia occurred at a
rate of 242 per million primary vaccinations;
eczema vaccinatum was estimated to occur in 10-39
persons per million primary vaccinations;
progressive vaccinia (or vaccinia necrosum),
occurred in approximately 1-2 persons per million
primary vaccinations and postvaccinial
encephalitis was been reported in 3-12 persons
per million primary vaccinations. Clearly the
studies on this "new vaccine" have not been
sufficient to demonstrate that the safety of this
vaccine is superior to the pre-existing Dryvax
vaccine. One can't help but wonder what ever
happened to research on newer vaccines using
newer vaccine development technology that might
result in safer vaccines that would clearly tip
the balance of the risk benefit equation over to
a safer product to vaccinate a larger proportion
of the population that would theoretically be at
risk of exposure should an accidental or
intentional release of the smallpox virus occur?
