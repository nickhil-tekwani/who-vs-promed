Health authorities in New Caledonia have called for tougher measures
to try to contain the spread of the mosquito-borne disease [virus],
chikungunya. A 1st case was detected nearly a month ago [February
2011] in a person arriving from Indonesia, but now 5 more people have
been diagnosed in a Noumea neighbourhood.

Chikungunya symptoms are similar to those of dengue, with high fever
accompanied by pain in the joints and the muscles, headaches and often
skin rash.

The authorities say the appearance of a cluster of cases calls for
new ways to try to fight the disease, as there may be resistance to
the chemicals being used now. The insecticide used in the spraying
campaign has been replaced by malathion, which has been banned in
France since 2008. Parents are also advised to apply repellants to
their children before they are sent to school.

In the French Indian Ocean island of La Reunion, the disease claimed
250 lives in 2006, when an epidemic hit about a 3rd of the island's
population.

[The 1st case of locally acquired chikungunya virus infection was
diagnosed on 3 Mar 2011 (see ProMED-mail archive number
20110308.0759). Now, there are 5 cases, and apparently mosquito vector
control has not been effective. If vector control is focused on adult
mosquitoes (spraying or fogging), control of vector populations and
transmission of the virus will be temporary if mosquito breeding sites
in water catchments in and immediately around houses are not reduced.
It is likely that additional cases will occur.
