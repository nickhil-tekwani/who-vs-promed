Re: Rabies - Indonesia: (Maluku) RFI (posting 20130228.1564144)
----------------------------------------------------
The background information provided by ProMED missed listing the 2 provinces (Papua and West Papua), that make up the western half of the island of New Guinea, among Indonesia's provinces which remain rabies free. By land mass, these 2 provinces are the largest of all 33 provinces in the country. Rabies gaining a foothold in New Guinea would be an unmitigated disaster given its remote location and difficult terrain.

[In the referred posting we indicated that rabies is endemic in 24 of the Indonesia's 33 provinces, mentioning 5 of them (Bangka Belitung, Central Java, East Java, Jakarta, and Yogyakarta) as currently regarded free of the disease.

Thanks to Michael Bangs for reminding that Papua and West Papua are included among such provinces, and for mentioning the importance of preventing rabies from continuing its spread there from the Maluku islands; see map at http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Maluku_Islands_en.png.

We are still waiting for responses to ProMED-mail's request for information regarding rabies in the island of Kisar. - Mod.AS
