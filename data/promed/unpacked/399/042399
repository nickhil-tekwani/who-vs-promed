As mysteries go, this one offers an intriguing trail of clues: A man
who suddenly falls ill. A deadly toxin. Guns. An "anarchist-type
textbook."

Beyond the items found in the man's motel room [in Las Vegas,
Nevada], authorities have revealed little about how the 57 year old
ended up unconscious and in critical condition, possibly from
exposure to the poisonous substance ricin.

The man, a graphic designer who was struggling financially, was
hospitalized on 14 Feb 2008 after struggling to breathe. Police say
they found several vials of ricin and the castor beans needed to make
it in his room at the Extended Stay America Hotel. A book in the room
was marked at a section about the poison, 500 micrograms of which
(about the size of the head of a pin), can kill a human. There was no
apparent link to terrorism, officials said, and they have yet to find
any more ricin.

FBI (US Federal Bureau of Investigation) spokesman Juan Becerra said
Sunday [2 Mar 2008] that the focus of the investigation was shifting
to Utah. Authorities, dressed in hazardous-material protection suits,
searched a home and garage-size storage units in the Salt Lake City
suburbs where the man recently lived. After being evicted from a Utah
apartment a few years ago, he moved into his cousin 's basement, said
a neighbor of the cousin in Riverton, Utah.

Neighbors called the man standoffish. A hulking man with wavy hair,
he worked with computers and delivered pizza. Much of his time was
spent with his pets, including a German shepherd. But he "dressed
normal; he wasn't a shaved-head supremacist guy or someone you'd
think would cause trouble," the neighbor said.

Eventually, the man moved into a neighbor's camper trailer. This
neighbor asked him to leave in August 2006, but did not specify why,
according to the Salt Lake Tribune. Neighbors heard little more about
[the graphic designer] until a few weeks ago. He had been
hospitalized at Spring Valley Hospital in Las Vegas and apparently
called his cousin.

Last week, when motel managers began the process of evicting the man,
they found 4 firearms and the book tabbed to the ricin section,
according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

Days later, this man's cousin discovered the castor beans and ricin
vials, which he took to hotel managers, authorities said. Health
officials are still working to determine whether the poison caused
the man's illness.

[The investigation continues and, as seen in the report above, has
spread to Utah. It remains unproven, but suspected, that the man has
suffered from ricin inhalation. Below is the CDC (US Centers for
Disease control and Prevention) advisory on ricin. - Mod.LL]

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is working
collaboratively with the Southern Nevada Health District's
Environmental Health Division, the FBI, and other public health and
law enforcement agencies to investigate a case of possible ricin
exposure in Las Vegas. Preliminary results of environmental testing
at laboratories in Nevada have tested positive for ricin. Ricin is a
potent biologic toxin that is derived from castor beans.

Clinical description for ricin exposure by ingestion
----------------------------------------------------
Ingestion of ricin typically leads to profuse vomiting and diarrhea,
which might be bloody, followed by hypovolemic shock and multisystem
organ dysfunction. Weakness and influenza-like symptoms, fever,
myalgia, and arthralgia might also be reported.

Clinical description for ricin exposure by inhalation
-----------------------------------------------------
Inhalation of ricin typically leads to cough and respiratory distress
followed by pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, and multisystem
organ dysfunction. Weakness and influenza-like symptoms of fever,
myalgia, and arthralgia might also be reported.

Case classification
-------------------
- Suspected. A case in which a potentially exposed person is being
evaluated by health-care workers or public health officials for
poisoning by a particular chemical agent, but no specific credible
threat exists.
- Probable. A clinically compatible case in which a high index of
suspicion (credible threat or patient history regarding location and
time) exists for ricin exposure, or an epidemiologic link exists
between this case and a laboratory-confirmed case.
- Confirmed. A clinically compatible case in which laboratory tests
have confirmed exposure. The case can be confirmed if laboratory
testing was not performed because either a predominant amount of
clinical and nonspecific laboratory evidence of a particular chemical
was present or a 100 percent certainty of the etiology of the agent
is known.

Laboratory testing for ricin
----------------------------
There are 2 types of laboratory testing available for suspected ricin
exposures:
- Environmental. Detection of ricin in environmental samples, as
determined by CDC (for suspected exposures from the environment) or
FDA (for suspected exposures from food or medication). Ricin can be
detected qualitatively by time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TRFIA) and
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in environmental specimens (such as,
filters, swabs, or wipes).
- Biologic. CDC can assess selected specimens on a provisional basis
for urinary ricinine, an alkaloid in the castor bean plant. Urinary
ricinine testing is the only clinical test for ricin exposure
available at CDC.

and laboratory testing can be found at MMWR 2005;54 (RR-01): 1-24
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5401a1.htm>

CDC requests that public health officials and clinicians who
encounter patients with symptoms consistent with ricin poisoning
report these cases to the CDC Emergency Operations Center, telephone
770-488-7100. The local poison control center (PCC) should also be
contacted at 1-800-222-1222 to report cases. Medical personnel are
available at PCCs to provide specific advice on treatment and
management of ricin poisoning if needed.

treatment, please visit CDC's website at
