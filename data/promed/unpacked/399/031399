BACTERIA MAY PLAY ROLE IN COLORECTAL CANCER
Researchers led by Dr. Alexander Swidsinski, of Humboldt Universitat, in
Berlin, Germany report in the current issue of Gastroenterology they have
found _E. coli_ bacteria invading the lining of the intestine in patients
with colorectal carcinoma or polyps, but not in patients without these
lesions, suggesting that the bacteria may contribute to the development of
colorectal cancer.
_E. coli_ is found in large numbers in the contents of the large intestine,
but strains of the bacteria that can adhere to the gut lining and invade it
may help trigger colorectal cancer.
In the study, the large intestines of 125 study participants were examined.
The group was comprised of patients undergoing colonoscopy screening for
colorectal cancer, or having colonoscopy in order to stage identified
malignancy. The study included 31 people with no bowel symptoms, 34
patients with abdominal complaints, 31 colorectal cancer patients, and 29
patients with colonic adenoma growths that can become cancerous. Mucosal
biopsies from the lining of the large intestine were taken from all study
participants.
No bacteria were detected in the biopsies of 97% of the patients with no
symptoms, or in 69% of samples from patients with abdominal complaints but
no history of cancer.
But bacteria were found "in 90% and 93% of patients with adenoma and
carcinoma, respectively."
