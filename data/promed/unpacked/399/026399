The Ministry of Agriculture made clarifications about social media comments on the subject of monitoring the health status of the herd, part of which was killed in Mafraq Governorate.

The ministry said in a press statement that the owner of the farm did not take the initiative to review the competent directorates and report the existence of expenses, while the report received by the competent Directorate of Agriculture by the Royal Administration for Environment and Tourism was about the presence of deaths in dairy cows within only one farm in the Khalidiya area, Mafraq Governorate, and the need of the presence of representatives of the Directorate of Agriculture to ensure the safety of the meat prepared for sale.

The ministry added the competent cadres of the Directorate of Agriculture inspected and performed necropsies of the dead herd and general examination of the farm. Through the virtual and clinical examination, it was found there were no signs of infectious viral or bacterial diseases, and the necropsy showed signs of blood poisoning in most samples received from the dead herd. All dead and slaughtered cows and the quantities of milk produced before death were destroyed. The 45 cows were culled on [Fri 3 Jun 2022]. The ministry continued to follow up on the necessary procedures and checks for the farm and the fodder used for the herd and transferring the file to the competent security and legal authorities. The virus tests came negative, so there was no viral disease causing the deaths.

It is reported the owner of the farm did not abide by the instructions issued by the Directorate of Agriculture by cleaning and sterilizing the drinkers (waterer) and feeders and gradually moving to a new bush (load of feed).

The ministry has formed a joint and specialized committee of doctors of the Mafraq municipality slaughterhouse and of the Directorate of Agriculture, to work on the necropsy of the cows slaughtered as they were found unfit for human consumption. The use of (atropine) by the farm owners to treat -- which is prohibited for ruminants because it works on a defect in the digestive system -- led to an increase in the absorption of toxins in the blood, and this led to an increase in expenditures during the 2 days [Fri 3 Jun 2022] and [Sat 4 Jun 2022].

The ministry confirmed this death is individual and not due to a viral or bacterial disease. The ministry added that it is keen on human health and safety by following up on the health and safety of the local products of milk and meat and that the comments circulated is a disgrace to health. We should not pay attention to unreliable information that is not based on any contrasted correct source.

[This article has some confusing things. Blood poisoning is not a very descriptive medical or veterinary term. In many regions, it means there was a severe infection or sepsis. If this was a type of infection, it is unclear why there is mention of atropine, which would not be a treatment for sepsis. Sepsis (an infection) would need antibiotics, not atropine. However, the article uses the word atropine. But I am unclear if it was treatment administered to the cattle by the owner. If so, atropine can be used to treat things like organophosphate poisoning. Perhaps the individual was trying to save his cattle by treating them with atropine after having used an organophosphate spray for insects. The article is unclear on why the atropine was used, if indeed it was used.

What seems clear is that a toxin and/or treatment resulted in the demise of the animals and the animals were necropsied, likely to determine the cause of death, and were not put into the food chain.

Extracted from the Merck Veterinary Manual https://www.merckvetmanual.com/toxicology/insecticide-and-acaricide-organic-toxicity/organophosphates-toxicity:

"In general, OP (organophosphates) pesticides have a narrow margin of safety, and the dose-response curve is quite steep. Signs of OP poisoning are those of cholinergic overstimulation, which can be grouped into 3 categories: muscarinic, nicotinic, and central. Muscarinic signs, which are usually the first to appear, include hypersalivation, miosis, frequent urination, diarrhea, vomiting, colic, and dyspnea due to increased bronchial secretions and bronchoconstriction. Nicotinic effects include muscle fasciculations and weakness. The central effects include nervousness, ataxia, apprehension, and seizures. Cattle and sheep commonly show severe depression. CNS (Central Nervous System) stimulation in dogs and cats usually progresses to convulsions. Some OPs (eg, amidothioates) do not enter the brain easily, so CNS signs are mild. The onset of signs after exposure is usually within minutes to hours but may be delayed for >2 days in some cases. The severity and course of intoxication is influenced principally by the dosage and route of exposure. In acute poisoning, the primary clinical signs may be respiratory distress and collapse followed by death due to respiratory muscle paralysis. In addition to brain and skeletal muscles, OPs are known to adversely affect other organ systems, including the cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, reproductive and developmental, and immune systems.

"An important diagnostic aid for OP poisoning is the determination of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in blood and brain. Unfortunately, the depression of blood cholinesterase does not necessarily correlate with the severity of poisoning; signs are seen when brain AChE activity is inhibited >70%, and the enzyme in the blood reflects, only in a general way, the levels in nervous tissue. The key factors appear to be the degree and rate at which the enzyme activity is reduced. Analyses performed after exposure may be negative because OPs do not remain long in tissues as the parent compounds. Chlorinated OP compounds have greater potential for tissue residue. Frozen stomach and rumen contents should be analyzed for the pesticide, using GC-MS for identification, confirmation, and quantitation. Blood/serum and urine can also be analyzed for residue of OPs or their metabolites. More than 70% of OPs produce one or more of the 6 dialkylphosphates (dimethyl phosphate, diethyl phosphate, dimethyl thiophosphate, diethyl thiophosphate, dimethyl dithiophosphate, and diethyl dithiophosphate).

"Lesions:
Animals with acute OP poisoning have nonspecific or no lesions. Pulmonary edema and congestion, hemorrhages, and edema of the bowel and other organs may be found. Animals surviving >1 day may become emaciated and dehydrated.

"Treatment:
Three categories of drugs are used to treat OP poisoning: 1) muscarinic receptor-blocking agents, 2) cholinesterase reactivators, and 3) emetics, cathartics, and adsorbents to decrease further absorption. Atropine sulfate blocks the central and peripheral muscarinic receptor-associated effects of OPs; it is administered to effect in dogs and cats, usually at a dosage of 0.2-2 mg/kg (cats at the lower end of the range), every 3-6 hr or as often as clinical signs indicate. For horses and pigs, the dosage is 0.1-0.2 mg/kg, IV, repeated every 10 min as needed; for cattle and sheep, the dosage is 0.6-1 mg/kg, one-third given IV, the remainder IM or SC, and repeated as needed. Atropinization is adequate when the pupils are dilated, salivation ceases, and the animal appears more alert. Animals initially respond well to atropine sulfate; however, the response diminishes after repeated treatments. Overtreatment with atropine should be avoided. Atropine does not alleviate the nicotinic cholinergic effects, such as muscle fasciculations and muscle paralysis, so death from massive overdoses of OPs can still occur. Including diazepam in the treatment reduced the incidence of seizures and increased the survival of nonhuman primates experimentally.

"An improved treatment combines atropine with the cholinesterase-reactivating oxime, 2-pyridine aldoxime methochloride (2-PAM, pralidoxime chloride). The dosage of 2-PAM is 20-50 mg/kg, given as a 5% solution IM or by slow IV (over 5-10 min), repeated at half the dose as needed. IV 2-PAM must be given very slowly to avoid musculoskeletal paralysis and respiratory arrest. Response to cholinesterase reactivators decreases with time after exposure; therefore, treatment with oximes must be instituted as soon as possible (within 24-48 hr). The rate at which the enzyme/organophosphate complex becomes unresponsive to reactivators (due to aging phenomenon) varies with the particular pesticide.

"Removal of the poison from the animal also should be attempted. If exposure was dermal, the animal should be washed with detergent and water (about room temperature) but without scrubbing and irritating the skin. Oral administration of mineral oil decreases absorption of pesticides from the GI tract. Activated charcoal (1-2 g/kg as a water slurry) adsorbs OPs and helps elimination in the feces. This is particularly recommended in cattle. Continued absorption of OPs from a large amount of ingesta in the rumen has caused prolonged toxicosis in cattle. Artificial respiration or administration of oxygen may be required. Phenothiazine tranquilizers, barbiturates, and morphine are contraindicated."

Based on the title of the source article ("Referral of the case of death of cows in Mafraq to the security services"), it appears the investigation is ongoing regarding the circumstances surrounding the illness affecting the cattle. ProMED would appreciate the results of the investigation from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.TG]
