Three new cases of the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu have been detected in
poultry on farms in the west African nation of Togo, a report said on
Saturday [11 Aug 2007]. The new cases were found in dead birds on farms in
the Lacs, Golfe and Zio regions east of the capital Lome, national
television reported.
In late June 2007, testing confirmed the presence for the 1st time in Togo
of the H5N1 strain in poultry in Sigbehoue, 45 km (30 miles) east of the
capital. About 8000 poultry birds were slaughtered in the area, and local
poultry markets were closed. Togolese authorities also stepped up controls
on poultry imports.
Togo in October of last year [2006] banned the import of live poultry and
poultry products from countries affected by the virus.
