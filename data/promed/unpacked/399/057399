Lumpy skin disease, the African cattle murrain discovered in the Karpas region, is still there. Although, according to the decision of the Ministry, 126 cattle, kept in 4 corrals were slaughtered in the villages Sipahi and Yesilkoy last week [week of 15 Dec 2014], an additional 3 cattle had to be culled yesterday [24 Dec 2014] in a corral in the village of Sipahi.

The disease is not zoonotic. However, the news about its spread has caused concern among consumers as related to the safety of dairy products and of meat. Livestock producers are also very anxious.

The Turkish Cypriot daily Kibris newspaper reports that 153 animals were slaughtered in Karpasia [in Turkish, Karpaz] because they contracted the contagious lumpy skin disease (LSD).

According to the paper, the largest numbers of sick animals are in Agia Triada [Turkish, Sipahi], and in Yiallousa village [Turkish, Yesilkoy].

The director of the Veterinary Office, Ramadan Goksen, has clarified the closure of hunting activities in the Karpaz region. The decision was taken by the council of ministers, addressing 15 plots in the affected area (particularly in the territories of the villages Yesilkoy and Sipahi) in order to prevent the spread of the virus. The transmission of infected vectors such as ticks, fleas, and other blood sucking insects to free areas could be enhanced by wild birds [hunted?] and hunting dogs.

Since the initial detection of the disease, a month ago, the disease has not yet been eradicated, requiring the mentioned additional, temporary measures. Goksen stressed the serious need for compliance (of everyone) with requirements such as fumigation and disinfection. External parasites of dogs (ticks, fleas, flies, etc) can transmit the virus while the dogs move within and outside the infected area.

There was some criticism of these activity-limiting steps from the hunters association.

[The lumpy skin disease (LSD) outbreak in northern (Turkish controlled) Cyprus has apparently remained, so far, limited to the Karpas region, a long, finger-like peninsula in north east Cyprus, about 70 km (43.5 mi) from continental Turkey. Its farthest extent, Cape Apostolos Andreas, is about 100 km (62 mi) from the Syrian coast to the east. The distance between the 2 affected villages, Sipahi and Yesilkoy, is about 17 km (10.5 mi; see map for their locations at http://tinyurl.com/mkmskyl; zoom out for Cyprus location vis-a-vis Turkey and Syria).

As long as the LSD infection is limited to a small area and temperatures remain low, its eradication by stamping out may have some chance of success and deserves consideration, in particular if the EC wishes its member state on the island, the Republic of Cyprus, to maintain its freedom from this highly infectious, vectorborne bovine disease. There is a precedent of successful LSD eradication (Israel, 1989). Even if attempted, ring vaccination may be required as well. In such case, the vaccine to be applied has to be selected the earliest, taking into consideration the vaccine's efficacy and its safety. Safety should be tested in both dairy and beef cattle.

At present, only live attenuated vaccines are commercially available for the prevention of LSD: the Neethling vaccine (LSD, South African vaccine) and other capripox vaccines, such as the RM65 sheep pox vaccine, produced elsewhere. The preferable system for veterinary vaccine testing is by controlled vaccination trials in susceptible animals. This was the policy applied in Israel in 1989, when the tests (of RM65 sheep-pox vaccine) were performed on susceptible cattle in a safety containment facility (stall) at the Kimron Veterinary Institute, Beit-Dagan. The safety level demonstrated was found to be optimal; the protection was satisfactory but sub-optimal. (For Israel's 1989 event, see commentary and reference in ProMED-mail posting 20141215.3034775).

In case LSD continues its spread, vaccination may become a necessity in highly susceptible animals in virgin areas and controlled tests with currently available vaccines deserve (early) consideration. (The facility at Beit-Dagan, was upgraded in 1999 with EU technical support).

Iran recently reported 2 new LSD outbreaks on its western (Iraqi) frontier, in addition to 4 earlier outbreaks in the same region (see Iran's follow-up report no 3 to OIE, dated 17 Dec 2014, at
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=16769).

According to the report, vaccination has been performed in the affected risk areas (in Khuzistan), involving 2500 vaccinated cattle. Reportedly, the vaccine applied was "live attenuated sheep pox/goat pox vaccine." Information on the vaccine strain applied and any available observations on the protection rendered and on any post-vaccination reactions, if occurred, will be helpful. - Mod.AS
