The European Commission on Wednesday [29 Mar 2000] announced compulsory
tests on thousands of cattle for mad cow disease (Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy, BSE) amid concerns the illness may be more widespread than
officially recognized.
"It is of utmost importance to learn as much as possible about the scale of
the disease in Europe. I encourage all member states to introduce these
tests," Food Safety Commissioner David Byrne said.
The random post-mortem tests, to start in 2001, would focus on cattle which
have died on the farm, as well as sick animals slaughtered in emergencies
and those displaying signs of a neurological disease.
Under the Commission's plan some 65,000 cattle out of a total herd of 41
million aged over 2 years will have to be tested in all EU countries.
The scope and size of the program could be extended in the future,
Commission spokeswoman Beate Gminder said. Recent research in Switzerland
has highlighted cases of BSE which may be going unreported and potentially
infecting meat still entering the food chain. Scientists there found 3 BSE
cases amid 7,000 supposedly safe cattle heading for the slaughterhouse.
The Commission, clearly concerned by the findings, said it wanted to use
the Swiss experience as a model for its program.
Scientists say it is still too early to say how many people will die from a
new form of the brain-wasting Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (nvCJD), believed
to be caused by eating BSE-infected meat.
The nvCJD death toll in Britain has risen above 50, and may eventually
reach thousands, experts say.
The Commission's proposal will be voted on by the EU's powerful Standing
Veterinary Committee on 5 Apr 2000.
