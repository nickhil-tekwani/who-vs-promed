Outbreak of African swine fever in Tamale
-----------------------------------------
Dr Evans Nsoh Ayamdooh, Tamale Metropolitan Veterinary Officer, on Thu [24
Feb 2005] announced an outbreak of African swine fever in the Metropolis.
Dr Ayamdooh told the Ghana News Agency in an interview that cases have been
reported in Choggu/Yapalse and Sanerigu communities. He said his outfit
had, with immediate effect, banned the movement of pigs and pork products
from the Region as part of measures to contain the spread of the disease.
Dr Ayamdooh has directed affected farmers to disinfect their styes and kill
all infected animals, since the disease is highly contagious.

[Tamale is situated in the Northern region of Ghana. We are grateful to Dr
Dudley for providing us with the following corrective information on the
geography of Ghana, as related to our previous posting on ASF in Ghana:
"The Brong Ahafo Region is located in central Ghana between the Ahanti
Region and Northern Region, while the Central Region is actually located in
the southern ["central"] coastal region of Ghana (to the south of the
Ashanti Region). Brong Ahafo outbreaks are bracketed between sites of
earlier outbreaks in Ahanti Region and Northern Region, and new reports
therefore don't constitute southward spread of the disease".
