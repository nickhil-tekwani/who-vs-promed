Alert due to outbreak of conjunctivitis, expanded to include the
state of Jalisco
-------------------------------------------------
Last Mon, 22 Sep 2003, the epidemiological alert issued as a result
of the outbreaks of conjunctivitis in Mexico was expanded to include
the state of Jalisco (to the west), where authorities confirmed that
595 people have been infected. These cases are in addition to the
9000 people affected by the condition registered last week. However,
official sources from the state of Tabasco have stated that there is
an underreporting of cases and that the total could reach 24 000.
Alfonso Petersen, health secretary for Jalisco, noted that the most
affected groups are people between 25 and 44 years of age (32.5
percent of the cases) and those between 10 and 14 years of age (20.6
percent of the cases). Petersen insisted that the outbreak has not
been controlled, that there has been an important increase in the
number of cases over the past few days, and that there is a risk for
the propagation of the disease.
The state health secretary announced that the National Public Health
Laboratory is studying 25 culture samples to identify the agents
directly involved in this infectious outbreak, given that the health
authorities cannot explain the sudden increase in the number of
cases. He further indicated that the symptoms and course of the
disease suggest that the virus is the same one that is affecting the
southeastern part of the country.
