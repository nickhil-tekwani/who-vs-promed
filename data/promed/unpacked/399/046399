[Reythemo is one of the 4 prefectures of Crete and can be seen at
<http://66.29.86.75/crete-maps/Crete-eot.png> or at the OIE WAHID reference
above. These OIE WAHID references almost always contains a map of the
outbreak location. Likewise, the location of the outbreak in Romania in
Covasna County can be seen at OIE WAHID or at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covasna_County>.

Although there appears to be little relationship geographically between
these 2 outbreaks, they did occur within a week of each other with starting
dates of 23 Oct 2007 in Greece and 17 Oct 2007 in Romania. It would be
interesting if a cooperative outbreak investigation implicates a commercial
linkage or intensive surveillance in wildlife shows some risk that accounts
for an admittedly somewhat tenuous association in time but disparate
location in space. In the end, these outbreaks may have nothing to do with
each other, but making progress in identifying sources of outbreaks for
poultry diseases should be a priority. - Mod.PC]
