Police investigate dioxin in Italian mozzarella
-----------------------------------------------
Makers of Italy's best mozzarella battled on Friday [21 Mar 2008] to
save the reputation of their cheese after police found some of it was
being made with milk contaminated with cancer-causing dioxin.

Police near Naples are investigating whether feed given to buffalo
herds, which produce the best milk for mozzarella, was tainted,
possibly by gangsters involved in illegal waste disposal.

The scandal is the latest blow to the cheese, which used to be seen
as by-word for fresh and natural Italian produce.

Sales of buffalo mozzarella plunged 40 percent in January [2008] due
to health fears when Naples and the surrounding Campania region
became inundated with household waste when the garbage disposal
system ground to a halt.

In an attempt to stop further damage, the association of buffalo
mozzarella makers took out full-page advertisements in Italian
newspapers on Friday [21 Mar 2008] to state that none of their
members were being investigated.

Farmers' association Coldiretti said the contamination only affected
a tiny part of mozzarella producers.

"We need as quickly as possible to separate the 'bad apple' from the
rest so we can defend what is one of the most representative 'Made in
Italy' brands: buffalo mozzarella," it said, promising to cooperate
with the investigation.

The Naples mafia -- known as the Camorra -- is heavily involved in
waste disposal, particularly the dumping and burning of industrial
waste in the Campania countryside, police say.

That has caused contamination of water, soil, and air, which
scientists have linked to higher instances of some cancers in parts
of the region.

Best known for its use melted on pizza, in Italy, 'buffala' which
costs at least twice as much as mozzarella made with cows' milk, is
often eaten on its own or in a salad with fresh tomatoes and basil.
Only 16 percent of the 33 000 tons annual production is exported.

Buffalo mozzarella production employs more than 20 000 people, an
important industry in one of Italy 's most economically backward regions.

Italy seals off 83 farms over mozzarella scare (updates with health
ministry statement)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Italy has sealed off 83 dairy farms after finding nearly one in 5
buffalo mozzarella producers were making cheese with above permitted
levels of cancer-causing dioxin, the health ministry said on
Wednesday [26 Mar 2008].

Seeking to avert a major health scare over one of Italy's best known
culinary products after Japan and South Korea blocked imports, the
ministry said special checks were being made to guarantee the safety
of the cheese.

Foreign minister Massimo D'Alema said international alarm was
"totally exaggerated and unjustified".

A health ministry statement said checks had revealed levels of dioxin
"moderately higher than the limit allowed by European Union
regulations" in the mozzarella and milk at 25 out of 130 cheese
factories -- a higher incidence than previously reported.

It said that as a result all the 83 dairy farms supplying the
producers affected had been sealed off while tests were under way to
establish where the contaminated milk came from.

"The measures adopted are intended to guarantee the safety of current
production, which continues to be subject to additional and
extraordinary checks," said the statement, issued after a meeting
involving several ministries.

Toxic chemical
--------------
The sealed-off farms are in the southern Campania region around
Naples where officials believe a garbage crisis earlier this year
[2008] is linked to the higher dioxin levels.

With dumps in the area full, locals burned piles of rubbish in the
streets and in open fields. Health officials say industrial waste was
also set ablaze spreading fumes that in some cases contained dioxin,
a toxic chemical.

"The presence of dioxin is not due to the garbage itself but to the
fact that substances containing dioxin have been burned and the
fallout from the smoke brought some dioxin to the ground," health
ministry undersecretary Gianpaolo Patta said.

"The great majority of mozzarella farms are untouched by this or by
other diseases and they are strictly controlled," he told Reuters.

Police in Campania were also investigating whether feed given to
buffalo herds, which produce the best milk for mozzarella, was
tainted, possibly by gangsters involved in illegal waste disposal.

Some mozzarella shops in Naples on Wednesday [26 Mar 2008] were
putting up notices saying their cheese was safe.

Japan and South Korea suspended imports at the weekend [22-23 Mar
2008] while the European Union had asked Italy for safety assurances
after reports that some of the cheese was made with contaminated milk.

A Japanese health ministry official said Japan wanted the names of
the producers affected by the contamination. "If we could be provided
with the names of these firms, we could again allow cheese from the
other producers to enter the country," he said.

Buffalo mozzarella, which costs at least twice as much as mozzarella
made with cows' milk, is best known abroad for its use on pizza,
although purists eat it on its own or with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil.

Rolando Manfredini, in charge of food safety at Italy's biggest
farmers group Coldiretti, said mozzarella sales at home and abroad
may fall 60 percent in the next couple of weeks.

The sector employs 20 000 people in Italy and makes 33 000 tonnes of
mozzarella a year, 16 percent of which is sold abroad.

Italy tells EU no contaminated mozzarella exported
--------------------------------------------------
Italy assured the European Commission on Thursday [27 Mar 2008] that
no mozzarella cheese contaminated with cancer-causing dioxin has been
exported, a Commission spokeswoman said.

EU health and food safety spokeswoman Nina Papadoulaki said the EU
executive had received fresh information from Rome after setting a
1700 GMT deadline for complete disclosure on the health scare
concerning the popular cheese produced in the Campania region.

"Apparently they are just in the local market, in the Italian market.
They were not sent to third countries nor to the EU," she told a news
conference.

"We are talking about 4 holdings that are positive and 23 dairy
establishments. The quantities of dioxins were higher than the EU
legislation requires but it was not excessive."

Japan and South Korea have halted imports of buffalo mozzarella, one
of Italy's best-known culinary products, over concerns about dioxin
contamination.

The spokeswoman repeatedly declined to say whether the European Union
executive was satisfied with the new Italian reply, saying Brussels
would wait until the deadline expired before determining whether it
had received complete information.

"If we don't get everything that we want we are still in constant
contact with the Italian authorities. We will assess the situation by
then and we will see whether further or any action needs to be
taken," she said.

Papadoulaki said possible measures the EU could take ranged from
"safeguards such as the withdrawal of all products on the market in
the region to a complete ban from the region".

Italy has sealed off more than 80 dairy farms after finding nearly
one in 5 buffalo mozzarella producers were making cheese that
contained dioxin above permitted levels.

The sealed-off farms are in the southern Campania region around
Naples, where officials believe a garbage crisis earlier this year
[2008] is linked to the higher dioxin levels.

streets and in open fields. Health officials say industrial waste was
also set ablaze spreading fumes that in some cases contained dioxin,
a toxic chemical.

[There is no indication of the level of dioxin in the cheese.
Generally, where there are dioxins, there are also polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs). I wonder whether there has been any testing for PCB.

Although there seems to be no doubt in the lay press about dioxin's
status as a carcinogen, there seems to be some controversy in the
toxicology literature (Bertazzi PA, Bernucci I, Brambilla G, Consonni
D, Pesatori AC: The Seveso studies on early and long-term effects of
dioxin exposure: a review. Environ Health Perspect 1998 Apr; 106
Suppl 2:625-33, available at
<http://www.ehponline.org/docs/1998/Suppl-2/625-633bertazzi/abstract.html>)

If there is someone with more information including definite levels
of dioxins and possible levels of PCB's in the cheese, ProMED-mail
would appreciate you contacting us with the information. - Mod.TG]
