New outbreaks

Outbreak 1 Siaying District, T'ai-Nan
Date of start of the outbreak 21 Mar 2011
Outbreak status Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Species Swine
Susceptible 119
Cases 30
Deaths 0
Destroyed 30
Slaughtered 0

Epidemiology - Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection -
Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: Abnormal lesions on fifteen pigs' feet were
found on the truck by routine inspection before they entered into the
auction market of Tainan City. The local animal disease control
competent authority traced back to the farm of origin to carry out the
clinical investigation. The result showed that 15 pigs on farm had the
same clinical lesions. Thirty pigs, the 15 pigs on the truck and the
15 pigs on the index farm, were destroyed on 21 March 2011.

Enforced biosecurity measures including movement control, cleaning
and disinfection have been implemented in the index farm. The
laboratory tests confirmed positive results of NSP antibody, whereas
the results of virus isolation and RT-PCR were all negative. A total
of 62 pig farms, 5 cattle farms and 2 goat farms within 3-km radius of
the index farm have been under vigilant monitoring and no clinical or
epidemiological evidence of infection was found.

Control measures - Measures applied

[It appears as if the animal health authorities are being very
cautious in their approach to this mixed set of test results. It is
indeed rare that we have 2 positive ELISA tests (antibody and
non-structural protein) but negative PCR and virus isolation. However,
a cautious result seems indeed to be warranted because of clinical
lesions and the fact that last week another serotype O isolate was
found in Penghu, which is a series of islands located approximately
equidistant between mainland China and Taiwan.
