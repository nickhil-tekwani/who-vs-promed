Boy dies of Marburg virus disease in Ibanda
-------------------------------------------
A one-and-half-year old boy has reportedly died of Marburg virus infection at Ruhoko Hospital in Ibanda District. The District Health Officer, Dr Julius Bamwine, on Thursday confirmed to 'Saturday Monitor' that the victim died on Wednesday night [7 Nov 2012]. "I can confirm to you that one of the victims from Kikyenkye, who had tested positive for Marburg virus disease died last night. He was the son [of a woman] who succumbed to the same disease recently," Mr Bamwine said. The baby becomes the 2nd person from Ibanda to die [as a result of Marburg virus disease, and the 9th overall in the region to succumb to the killer virus.

The Health Ministry confirmed the Marburg virus disease outbreak a month ago in the western district of Kabale. It has since spread to 3 other districts in Western Uganda. The child's mother died of Marburg virus disease at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital on 23 Oct 2012. Her husband had also tested positive [and survived/died ?]. The boy was admitted at Rukoho Hospital with 4 other suspected cases last week.

The number of suspected cases has since gone up to 12. Dr Bamwine said they are in the process of discharging 8 people who have tested negative while 4 still remain under surveillance as they wait for their results from Uganda Virus Research Institute in Entebbe. At Mbarara hospital, 3 suspected cases admitted last week have tested negative and have been discharged. But on Wednesday 2 more cases were admitted who exhibited symptoms similar to those of the Marburg virus disease.

"We have 2 male suspected Marburg patients; one is from Kisenyi in Kakoba Division, Mbarara Town. He had severe nasal bleeding. The other is from Rwampara County in Mbarara. He was vomiting and passed stool with blood," said Ms. Eugenia Namulindwa, the physician in-charge of the isolation unit.

Marburg [virus disease] is a rare, severe type of haemorrhagic fever which affects both humans and non-human primates. The virus is reported to be transmitted through bodily fluids like saliva and blood of an infected person, along with touching infected wild animals such as monkeys.

[As of 28 Oct 2012, a total of 18 cases and 9 deaths, including a health worker, had been reported from 5 districts, namely Kabale district, in southwestern Uganda, Kampala (the capital city), Ibanda, Mbarara and Kabarole. The current report concerns the death of a child in Ibanda district, and a number of suspected but as yet unconfirmed cases. The deceased child was the son of woman who had died previously as a result of Marburg virus disease. The child's father has also tested positive for Marburg virus infection, consistent with the the fact that the majority of the confirmed cases have been family members. However there are some inconsistencies between this report and the previous one, and a clear unambiguous statement of the numbers of confirmed and suspected cases is awaited.
