Yellow Fever in Burkina Faso, as of Wed 24 Nov 2004
-----------------------------------------------
WHO has received reports of an outbreak of yellow fever in the
district of Sindou, Cascades region, in the southwest of the country,
near the border of Cote d'Ivoire and Mali. One case, who died on 10
Oct 2004, has been laboratory confirmed by Centre Muraz, Burkina Faso
and by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Yellow Fever, the Institut
Pasteur, Dakar, Senegal.
A team from the Ministry of Health and WHO quickly investigated the
outbreak and took 15 additional blood samples. Surveillance has been
intensified. The disease is limited to a remote area, with very low
vaccine coverage.
A yellow fever mass-vaccination campaign will be undertaken in Sindou
district in the coming weeks, together with a measles vaccination
campaign for children 9 months of age.

[Earlier in the year (11 May 2004), WHO posted a report on a Yellow
Fever epidemic in Burkina Faso in the districts of Bobo-Dioulasso and
Gaoua. As of 29 Aug 2004, the confirmed total number of cases in this
outbreak was given as 9, including 2 deaths [see: Yellow fever -
Burkina Faso (04) 20041017.2819]. It is presumed that that outbreak
was controlled by mass vaccination. - Mod.CP]
