[3] France: breakthrough infections after postexposure vaccination against mpox
Date: Thu 29 Dec 2022
Source: New England Journal of Medicine [edited]
https://bit.ly/3jIZb11


During the current outbreak of monkeypox (recently renamed mpox), smallpox vaccination has been recommended to prevent mpox infection in persons who have had mpox exposure, but evidence to support this practice is limited. We conducted a study to evaluate potential breakthrough infections in participants who had received smallpox vaccine after high-risk exposure to mpox.

From 27 May through 13 Jul 2022, we performed a single-center observational analysis involving all consecutive participants who had received a 3rd-generation smallpox vaccine (JYNNEOS [Imvanex]) at a subcutaneous 0.5-ml dose (a nominal titer of 5 x 107 TCID50 [50% tissue-culture infectious dose]) after a high-risk mpox exposure. These exposures were defined as direct skin-to-skin or mucosal contact with an infected person, indirect contact, exposure to respiratory droplets, or all of these exposures (definitions are provided in the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org). Written informed consent was obtained from all the participants. The ethics committee of the Sorbonne Paris North University approved the study.

A total of 276 participants had received one dose of vaccine 11 days (interquartile range, 8 to 14) after exposure. A total of 114 participants (41%) had 2 overlapping types of exposure -- mainly indirect exposure plus exposure to respiratory droplets (in 78 participants [28%]) and direct exposure plus exposure to respiratory droplets (in 28 participants [10%]) -- and 102 participants (37%) had all 3 types of exposure (direct exposure, indirect exposure, and exposure to respiratory droplets). Among the 276 vaccinated participants, 233 (84%) were men who had sex with men, with a median of 8 sexual partners (interquartile range, 3 to 13) in the previous month. No severe adverse events or safety concerns were identified. Twelve of the 276 vaccinated participants (4%) had a subsequent confirmed nonsevere mpox infection; of these participants, 4 (33%) had well-controlled human immunodeficiency virus infection (as compared with 33 of 264 [12%] among those who were vaccinated and uninfected) and 2 (17%) had a history of smallpox vaccination (as compared with 28 of 264 [11%] among those who were vaccinated and uninfected). Mpox infection developed in 10 of the 12 participants within 5 days after vaccination, in 1 participant at 22 days, and in 1 participant at 25 days. The participants in whom mpox infection did not develop received a 2nd dose of vaccine after a median of 29 days (interquartile range, 28 to 33).

Early infections may be explained by the delay between exposure and vaccination (median, 11 days) because the incubation of mpox ranges from 5 to 21 days, but these infections also raise the possibility of an earlier exposure. The 2 participants with breakthrough infections at 22 and 25 days indicated that they had not had a new exposure, but they were the only participants who had a pet (one cat and one dog that were both asymptomatic and that shared the participants' homes but did not sleep with them).

Our study has several limitations. It was conducted at a single center, and we were not able to assess exposure to mpox. In addition, the study had an open-label design, did not have a control group or measures of vaccine-elicited immunity, and had limited external validity.

In this study population, 4% of the participants who had received postexposure vaccination with a 3rd-generation smallpox vaccine had a subsequent mpox infection during the 1st month after receipt of the 1st vaccination.

[4] USA: demographic and clinical characteristics of mpox in unvaccinated patients and patients with one dose

Citation: Farrar JL, Lewis NM, Houck K, et al. Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of Mpox in Persons Who Had Previously Received 1 Dose of JYNNEOS Vaccine and in Unvaccinated Persons -- 29 U.S. Jurisdictions, 22 May-3 Sep 2022. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2022;71:1610-1615
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
What is already known about this topic?
Evidence suggests that 1 dose of JYNNEOS vaccine offers some protection against monkeypox (mpox).

What is added by this report?
Analysis of mpox infections among unvaccinated persons and those who had received 1 JYNNEOS vaccine dose 14 days or more before illness onset found that the odds of fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, and chills were significantly lower among vaccinated patients than among unvaccinated patients. Overall, 2% of vaccinated persons with mpox and 8% of unvaccinated patients were hospitalized.

What are the implications for public health practice?
One dose of JYNNEOS vaccine might attenuate the severity of illness and reduce hospitalization in persons who become infected after vaccination; however, to optimize protection, all eligible persons are recommended to complete the 2-dose vaccination series.

Discussion
----------
In this analysis of 276 mpox cases in persons who received 1 dose of JYNNEOS vaccine 14 days before illness onset and 6329 cases in unvaccinated persons during the 2022 U.S. outbreak, vaccinated patients reported signs and symptoms similar to those described earlier in the outbreak (1); however, some symptoms were reported less frequently among vaccinated than among unvaccinated mpox patients. In addition, the percentage of vaccinated patients who were hospitalized (2%) was lower than that among unvaccinated patients (8%), and the odds of systemic signs and symptoms, such as fever and chills, were lower among vaccinated patients. These findings indicate that 1 dose of the JYNNEOS vaccine might attenuate the severity of mpox illness in persons who are infected after vaccination.

The frequent presentation of rash in the genital and perianal areas among both vaccinated and unvaccinated mpox patients suggests that sexual transmission in this population was a common mechanism of transmission. The fewer number of reported rash locations among vaccinated patients suggests possible prevention of spread of rash from site of inoculation among even partially vaccinated persons.

The predominance of White persons among vaccinated mpox patients compared with unvaccinated patients reflects the ongoing racial and ethnic disparities in receipt of the JYNNEOS vaccine nationwide (5,6) and could indicate differential access to or acceptance of the vaccine. Disparities in access to health care and additional treatment options could also have played a role in decreasing the severity of illness in vaccinated White persons.

The findings in this report are subject to at least 4 limitations. First, 47% of cases were excluded because of missing vaccination information; therefore, results might not be generalizable to all persons with mpox in the United States. Second, persons with mpox who received vaccine outside of their respective jurisdictions of residence might not have had documentation of vaccine receipt, which could lead to potential undercounting of cases among vaccinated persons (7), although many jurisdictions did report sharing vaccination data with one another (Sarah Gillani, MPH, District of Columbia Department of Health, personal communication, September 2022). Third, self-reported doses were included to optimize ascertainment of vaccination status, but self-report is less accurate than documented vaccine receipt and could result in misclassification of vaccination status. Finally, clinical data were not available for all cases. In particular, HIV status was unknown or missing for 2/3 of vaccinated and more than one half of unvaccinated patients. Because HIV infection might affect the trajectory and illness severity, future studies with additional data for real-world use of JYNNEOS vaccine against clinical outcomes, including data on HIV history, are needed.

The more limited distribution of rash and reduced severity of illness among persons who had mpox after receiving 1 JYNNEOS vaccine dose supports the potential benefit of vaccination on attenuation of disease. Although infection 14 days after receipt of 1 JYNNEOS vaccine dose is infrequent, the occurrence of such cases and the unknown duration of protection conferred by 1 vaccine dose highlights the need for providers and public health officials to encourage completion of the 2-dose vaccination series among persons at risk and continue to provide guidance and education regarding nonvaccine-related prevention strategies (4) until optimal immune protection from the second dose is achieved.

[This article further supports the argument for prophylactic vaccination against mpox in high risk groups and the importance of waiting at least 14 days before engaging in high risk behaviors that could result in exposure. If these vaccinations are effective at preventing severe disease, should primary care providers start to consider encouraging all at-risk patients to receive the mpox series as vaccine supply improves? - Mod.CS]

[5] USA: mpox cases among cisgender women and pregnant persons
Date: Fri 6 Jan 2023
Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7201a2


Citation: Oakley LP, Hufstetler K, O'Shea J, et al. Mpox Cases Among Cisgender Women and Pregnant Persons -- United States, 11 May-7 Nov 2022. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2023;72:9-14.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
What is already known about this topic?
Data from the ongoing monkeypox (mpox) outbreak on cases in cisgender women and in pregnancy are limited.

What is added by this report?
Among 769 mpox cases reported among U.S. cisgender women, Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino women were disproportionately affected. Most cisgender women reported recent sexual activity with men. Twenty-three cases among pregnant or recently pregnant persons were reported and all recovered. Four pregnant persons were hospitalized for mpox, and tecovirimat was tolerated with no adverse reactions.

What are the implications for public health practice?
Continued monitoring of mpox risk in cisgender women and during pregnancy is critical to assessing the impacts of mpox on sexual, reproductive, and overall health and to better understand perinatal outcomes.

Discussion
----------
Monkeypox virus infections in cisgender women during 11 May-7 Nov 2022 constituted < 3% of total U.S. cases. Consistent with disparities observed overall during the ongoing mpox epidemic, the proportion of Black and Hispanic women with mpox was higher than the proportion of Black and Hispanic women in the U.S. population (6). This finding is similar to disparities among mpox cases in the United States overall and underscores the continued need for public health efforts to provide education on prevention of mpox and ensure equitable access to mpox vaccination, testing, and treatment.

Sex or close intimate contact within 3 weeks of symptom onset was reported by nearly 3/4 of cisgender women with mpox, and genital lesions were frequently reported, suggesting sexual exposure as a likely primary route of transmission. Obstetrician-gynecologists and other providers should consider mpox when examining new genital, oral, or breast lesions. Patient education regarding risks for transmission of Monkeypox virus and other sexually transmitted infections should be provided.

Genital lesions in pregnant persons pose a risk for Monkeypox virus transmission to the fetus during vaginal delivery. A thorough skin and mucosal (e.g., anal, vaginal, and oral) examination for mpox lesions should be performed in persons with possible mpox near the time of delivery to identify lesions of which they might be unaware. When mpox lesions, including genital lesions, are present, shared decision-making should be considered when discussing route of delivery. Because there might be an increased risk for severe disease in newborns, breastfeeding should be temporarily delayed until criteria for discontinuing isolation have been met (lesions have resolved, the scabs have fallen off, and a fresh layer of intact skin has formed).

Clinicians caring for cisgender women and pregnant persons should become familiar with clinical considerations for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of mpox and should provide pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis if indicated. Vaccination with JYNNEOS should be provided to eligible persons, including those who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and providers should discuss vaccination risks and benefits.

The findings in this report are subject to at least 3 limitations. First, data for some variables such as exposure risk and HIV status were frequently missing (92%). Thus, these data might not represent the characteristics of the overall sample. Second, the small sample size of currently and recently pregnant persons with mpox might limit the generalizability of outcomes. Finally, additional time is needed for pregnancy completion to describe outcomes among all cases of mpox during pregnancy.

Cases of mpox have occurred primarily among adult gay, bisexual, and other MSM during the current outbreak; however, any person, including cisgender women, can also acquire infection. Public health efforts should include more emphasis on cisgender women who might be at increased risk for exposure. In addition, although most reported cases of mpox in pregnant persons have been managed in the outpatient setting, some persons might require hospitalization, and there is a risk for perinatal transmission. To mitigate this risk, pregnant, recently pregnant, and breastfeeding persons should be offered prophylaxis or treatment if indicated. Continued collection of information is critical to evaluating the risk for transmission, informing infection prevention and control, and assessing the impact of mpox on the sexual, reproductive, and overall health of cisgender women. In addition, collection of longitudinal data among pregnant persons and their infants is critical to understanding the effects of mpox on maternal and neonatal outcomes. CDC, in collaboration with health departments, will continue to follow cases in pregnant and recently pregnant persons and provide updates as data become available.

[While the majority of cases were exacerbated by sexual practices in men who have sex with men, it is important to recognize that mpox can and will have impacts on individuals outside of that group. Patient education and vaccinations need to be provided to those outside of MSM and LGBTQ communities to ensure that all groups are protected against mpox. Mpox also needs to be considered in patient differentials by providers when evaluating patients outside of current/known high-risk groups. - Mod.CS]
