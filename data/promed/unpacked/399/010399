A jealous businessman has been arrested and confessed to a mass food
poisoning in China which left at least 38 people dead and hundreds
ill, state media reported.
Chen Zhengping, who owned a snack shop in Tangshan, was arrested
shortly after the poisoning outbreak Saturday in Tangshan township in
eastern China's Nanjing city state television's evening news reported.
"Because of business competition, he developed hatred (for his
competitor) and used a rat poison 'Dushuqiang' banned by the
government to poison and commit the crime," said the Xinhua news
agency's website.
Several hundred others were rushed to approximately 10 hospitals
after eating the rat poison-laced breakfast food from a soybean milk
snack shop in Tangshan.

Hundreds of people fell ill after eating food laced with rat poison
at a snack shop selling fried dough, sesame cakes, and rice in the
Chinese city of Nanjing, and police opened a criminal investigation
into the poisonings.
Authorities refused to release a death toll, but state media said
more than 200 people were sickened and suggested dozens, including
many children, might have died.
China has reported numerous cases of food poisoning in which
restaurants tried to save money by using toxic industrial salts
instead of table salt or cooks mistook rat poison or other chemicals
for food ingredients. In July 2002, a noodle shop owner in southern
China was arrested on charges that he poisoned customers at a rival
business by putting rat poison in its soup.
The state-controlled media provided only scant accounts of the
investigation into Saturday's poisonings. Reporters visiting Tangshan
county saw investigators in white gloves searching a food-processing
factory that supplied the shop and examining the ground outside. The
Heshengyuan Soybean Milk Shop where the poisoned food was bought was
closed, and its telephone went unanswered.
Police were questioning the manager of a company that supplied food
to the shop, the state newspaper China Daily reported.
"Now we are clear it is a criminal case. The police will certainly
question all related people for investigation," said a spokeswoman
for the Nanjing city government, who would give only her surname, Wu.
She declined to confirm details in the newspaper's account of the
investigation. The spokeswoman said Hong Kong newspaper reports that
41 people were killed were wrong, but she refused to release a death
toll.
Newspapers and an official reached by telephone at the Jiangsu
Province Epidemic Prevention Station said examination of samples sent
from hospitals showed victims had eaten rat poison.
China's Cabinet and Communist Party headquarters in Beijing have sent
investigators to Nanjing and ordered "strenuous efforts" to uncover
the cause, according to state newspapers.
Victims became sick after eating fried dough sticks, sesame cakes,
and glutinous rice for breakfast. Many were students at the nearby
Zuochang Middle School and migrant construction workers, according to
state media.
Students and teachers at the military-run Nanjing Artillery Institute
also were sickened, according to teachers contacted by telephone at
the Zuochang school. Many of those poisoned were boarding students
whose school provided breakfast bought from the shop, the Ta Kung Pao
newspaper of Hong Kong reported.
Those papers and the China Daily, citing unidentified sources, said
dozens of people might have been killed.
Military vehicles joined ambulances in rushing the sick to hospitals
across Nanjing, where many had to be treated in hallways and
entranceways due to the overwhelming number of victims.
The Zuochang school was closed and empty, with police posted outside its gates.

Rat poison is the suspected cause of an outbreak of food poisoning in
China, in which dozens of people are believed to have died.
"Initial investigations indicate there was rat poison in the food
that was served to the victims," the China Daily quoted Zhou Qiang, a
publicity official with the Jiangsu provincial government, as saying.
He said the poison could have been deliberately put into the food by
someone, but public security authorities were still looking into the
case that left hundreds of patrons of a small Nanjing store ill.
All of those affected fell sick on or shortly after Saturday morning.
The victims were mostly students from 4 schools and transient workers
from a construction site in Tangshan, a small town to the east of
Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu Province.
The China Daily said 500 medical personnel have been mobilized to
deal with the case.
The victims fell ill after eating the food from Heshenyuan Soybean
Milk Shop, a designated supplier of breakfast to schools for years.
The catering service has been shut down and its owner has been taken
into custody for questioning. According to reports, the source of
the outbreak is believed to be a branch of the Heshengyuan Soy Milk
restaurant in the Tangshan district of Nanjing. The restaurant has
since been closed.
Central authorities in Beijing have ordered "all efforts be made to
save the victims" the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. It
added that the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Public Security
have both dispatched teams to the city to help medical staff and
investigate the outbreak.
Several of the victims were reported to have collapsed, some coughing
up blood, just minutes after eating at the restaurant.
Reports in China's state-controlled media on the exact numbers of
casualties have been mixed and confused. On Saturday the official
Xinhua news agency reported that 41 people had died and up to 400 had
been made ill by the poisoning. However, that report was quickly
deleted and replaced by an earlier story saying only that "a number
of victims" had died and more than 200 were poisoned. The Web site
of the state-run People's Daily newspaper followed a similar line
saying "several people" had died, but specifying no actual number.
Some local eyewitnesses, however, told reporters they believe dozens
of people may have died, with scores of ambulances seen ferrying
victims to hospitals across the city. One shop owner was quoted by
Reuters news agency as recalling how he saw one elderly man collapse
after eating breakfast at the restaurant Saturday. "It happened
right there in front of my store," Peng Yongqing was quoted as
saying. "One minute he was sitting there eating and the next he stood
up and keeled over. We all thought he was choking, we had no idea
what was wrong." Penh said he had heard that the man had died on the
way to hospital.
Previous mass food poisoning outbreaks in China have been blamed on a
variety of causes including use of cheaper industrial salts rather
than proper culinary salt. Last year police arrested 2 owners of a
noodle factory on charges of lacing their product with rat poison,
causing at least 89 consumers to be hospitalized. Last September
Nanjing was hit by another food scandal when state television
broadcaster CCTV accused a local bakery of recycling old fillings for
moon cakes -- a popular festival delicacy -- and wrapping them in
fresh crusts.

[In this episode as well as a prior episode in 2001, dushuqiang,
"super rat poison" has been identified as the agent used. Dushuqiang
is a farm chemical that has been banned, but is available on the
illegal market in rural areas according to some of the newswire
reports. We have been unable to identify the composition of
dushuqiang, so if there are any subscribers with information on this
we would appreciate receiving it.
In the absence of the composition of the specific toxin involved,
some brief musings on the general subject of rat poison. Rat poison
is a generic term for the various chemicals that have been used as
rodenticides. While many people assume that rat poison is primarily
warfarin (a drug that is used as an anticoagulant, to prolong
bleeding times in patients with clotting disorders), the list of
toxic chemicals that are used in the variety of products falling
under the category of rat poison is rather lengthy.
Some of the more notable compounds used that, if ingested by humans,
result in a rapid onset of symptoms and death include: Sodium
monofluoroacetate (SMFA) (2-20 hours), Strychnine (10-20 mins),
Elemental Phosphorus (1-2 hours), arsenic (1 hour), Red squill (?30
mins-6 hours). (From: Goldfrank et.al., Goldfrank's Toxicologic
Emergencies, Third Edition, 1986). Hydrogen cyanide is also used in
rat poison.
As mentioned in the various newswires we have collated for posting on
this episode, this is not the first time there has been an
intentional food poisoning in China using a rodenticide product. Most
prior events were similar to this in terms of being personal
rivalries or disputes at a very local level. Unfortunately none of
the prior episodes have been published in peer review journals
accessible via PubMed, though newswire reports are obtainable through
use of various web-based search engines. None of the newswires on
this current or on prior intentional rodenticide food poisonings have
identified the specific chemical toxin used. From the limited
descriptions provided in this current event, it is possible that
hydrogen cyanide or arsenic was the chemical involved. Ingestion of
either chemical can lead to dyspnea, paralysis, convulsions, and
respiratory arrest. Death may occur within minutes. Lesser
concentrations can cause headache, vertigo, nausea, and vomiting.
Gastrointestinal bleeding has been associated with toxic ingestion of
both hydrogen cyanide and arsenic. Agitation is more common with
hydrogen cyanide intoxication. A short description comparing acute
cyanide poisoning with acute arsenic poisoning taken from
Pre-Hospital Disaster Medicine journal is accessible on the
University of Wisconsin website: Differentiate Cyanide from Arsenic
Poisoning by Alan H. Hall MD.
<http://pdm.medicine.wisc.edu/hall.htm>
Strychnine cannot be ruled out as well, as a neurotoxin, if one
speculates that the "coughing up blood" was from trauma following a
seizure, rather than from gastrointestinal bleeding.
Unless there is more information on the actual chemical composition
of dushuqiang, this thread is now closed. - Mod.MPP]
