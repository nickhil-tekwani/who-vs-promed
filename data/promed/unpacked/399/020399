A mother died when she contracted anthrax after injecting contaminated heroin, an inquest heard.

[The woman], Rochester [Kent], injected the drug and soon complained of pain and swelling in her left arm. The 42-year-old, who had a daughter, visited her GP on [7 Dec 2012]. She was diagnosed with cellulitis -- inflammation of the skin. That evening she visited Medway Maritime Hospital and doctors diagnosed her as having deep vein thrombosis.

[The 42 year old woman], who was born in Chatham, was taken into surgery and given an intravenous infusion of a drug designed to clear the clot in her arm.

An inquest at the Archbishop's Palace in Maidstone heard she requested methadone as she was in pain.

However, a coroner heard a nurse later found the patient, who was trying to quit heroin, drinking from the bottle. Shortly after taking the methadone, she suffered a cardiac arrest and a scan revealed there was bleeding on the right side of her brain. She was rushed to King's College Hospital in London, but died on [9 Dec 2012].

The cause of death was given as the acute bacterial infection anthrax and intravenous drug abuse. The inquest was told the bacteria had spread to her brain and caused bleeding, which can develop very quickly.

Coroner Patricia Harding recorded a verdict of accidental death.

[This case was previously reported by ProMED-mail (see archives 20121224.1467879 and 20121219.1460313).

There is no mention in this report of the patient receiving any antibiotic treatment, just an intravenous drug to clear the clot in her arm. Logically this treatment might have facilitated a systemic infection. It is not clear what the "intravenous antithrombotic drug" was. It could have been one of the kinases, such as streptokinase or alteplase (rt-PA, tissue type plasminogen activator), or it could have been heparin. If it was a kinase then one of the side effects listed is indeed intracerebral haemorrhage. Heparin can also cause severe bleeding (counteracted by protamine sulphate). Of course the disease itself can cause cerebral problems, but in this case they do not specifically mention signs of meningitis (typically called 'Cardinal's cap' by my Russian colleagues). Neither do they supply any blood chemistry results such as platelet count. Death in anthrax is typically very sudden.

I am in debt to Robert Spencer (<rcs1947@hotmail.uk>) for his information on antithrombotic drugs and their side effects. Many thanks. - Mod.MHJ
