Pastoralists in Rabdhure and Elbarde in southern Somalia's Bakool region are complaining about an unidentified disease that has been killing their goats and camels since May [2021].

[NAM], a goat herder in Aato village, said she lost 24 of her 120 goats over 3 weeks. She described the goats as having fever and being unable to walk and dying quickly within 24 hours of falling sick.

"Pastoralists provide for their families from the sale of their livestock's milk and meat. But now everyone fears the disease, no one is buying camel and goat products," she said.

[NAM] has stopped giving her children milk or meat as well. Instead, she said she is buying them fish and powdered milk using money she saved from the sale of some goats before the disease outbreak.

[NAM] said she had lost 60 camels to drought between 2017 and 2020. This was yet another blow to her livelihood.

[ADA], a camel herder in El-magad, said he lost 6 of his 10 camels to the disease at the end of May [2021]. He is worried that his remaining camels and 150 goats could get infected.

"We counted on the camels for milk since the goats don't have enough milk due to the prolonged drought. Some of the people have lost their entire herd of livestock to this disease," he said. [ADA] said the market has stalled due to fear of the disease, and he has not been able to sell any animals for the last 3 weeks.

Ahmed Yussuf Arab, a veterinarian in Yed district, where the disease is concentrated, told Radio Ergo the pastoralists are using antibiotics that they think might help the sick animals. He himself visited affected villages and described the symptoms of some of the infected animals as bleeding from the nose and the rectum.

The livestock ministry in South West state conducted a survey in Rabdhure and Elbarde but is still working to identify the disease before being able to implement treatment and control measures. The ministry coordinator, Sulub Ali Lohos, told Radio Ergo they have recorded the deaths of 233 camels in the villages they visited and that the ministry has determined that the disease is spreading to other animals.

[Bakool is a region in southwestern Somalia, bordered on its North by Ethiopia; see map at http://tinyurl.com/jkrdmt53.

Previous reports on the event mentioned mass mortality in camels in southeastern Ethiopia and adjacent Bakool in Somalia, in tandem with human disease cases, attributing them to contact with sick camels or consumption of their meat; see ProMED posts 20210624.8471650 and 20210625.8472897. The current report from Somalia adds goats as affected species to camels. Among the zoonotic diseases fatal to animals, which come to mind for the epidemiological and laboratory investigations, Rift Valley fever and anthrax are prominent.

The connection between the events in eastern Ethiopia and southwest Somalia, as well as the suggestion that the camel (and goat) disease shares common causative agent(s), is yet to be established.

According to Omani et al. (1), epidemics of "camel sudden death syndrome" in neighboring Kenya, reported several times in the past, were shown to be related to the morbilivirus causing peste des petits ruminants (PPR). Goats are highly susceptible to PPR; this disease deserves to be excluded as well.

PPR is not zoonotic. In cases confirmed in the current event, a scenario to be considered is mixed infections, incorporating zoonotic and non-zoonotic disease agents circulating side by side in the involved animal populations, causing mass mortalities in camels and possibly in other ruminants.

Combatting the disease events reported from human and animal in Ethiopia and Somalia requires a close cooperation between local, national and international public and animal health agencies. In other words, a One Health approach.
