Are you [in India] planning an African safari this summer? A getaway to the Serengeti in Tanzania to film the wildebeest and stalk the Big Five? Be warned. Your plans could go very wrong. All because of a seemingly small yet significant detail called the yellow fever [YF] vaccine, or rather, the lack of it in the State's Public Health Institute [PHI].

The Public Health Institute, Bangalore, the only designated centre in the state authorised to administer the vaccine, has been pleading "No Stock" for 2 months now. Worse, the "No Stock" syndrome seems to apply only to the PHI, where a dose of the vaccine costs Rs 200 [USD 3.68]. In the open market, pharmacists not only have adequate stock of the vaccine, they also sell a single dose at Rs 1534 [USD 28.23].

Desperate travellers have little choice but to fork out a small fortune for the vaccine, which they then carry to the PHI, which administers it.

Why isn't PHI being proactive in procuring the much-in-demand vaccine? "Yes, the number of people asking for the yellow fever vaccine is high during the holiday season. We give nearly 100 vaccinations every Wednesday, but for 2 months, we have had no stock. The vaccine comes to us from Kasauli in Himachal Pradesh," says Dr Jaikumar, deputy director and in-charge joint director, PHI Bangalore. Has the PHI been following up the shortage issue with the Central Research Institute (CRI), Kasauli? "Of course, but I cannot pressure them," he adds.

Paucity in the PHI is contrasted by plentiful stocks in some pharmacies in the City. Nearly 30-40 vaccines are sold a month during the holiday season in these pharmacies. They too say the vaccine is in short supply, but manage to get it on demand. A well-known pharmacy on Residency Road was able to procure 3 doses of the vaccine Stanmaril, manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur SA, based in Lyon, France, and imported and marketed in India by Sanofi Pasteur India Pvt Ltd, Navi Mumbai, in less than 12 hours of placing a request, at Rs 1534 [USD 28.23] a dose.

Those who have air tickets booked and safari schedules blocked prefer buying the vaccine for a hefty price at a pharmacy rather than bite their nails in frustration after making daily calls to the PHI to check on the availability of the vaccine.

The vaccination, valid for 10 years once taken, has a 20-day incubation period [11 day period for the vaccination to become effective], which makes it necessary for 1st-time travellers to plan their vaccination schedule.

Failure to take the vaccination may get one past immigration but would certainly mean quarantine for 10 days, on return, in a government hospital.

The best bet, if the PHI is out of stock, is [for travel agencies] to refer clients to the King Institute of Preventive Medicine, Guindy, Chennai, or the Institute of Preventive Medicine, Hyderabad.

"Not just the PHI, all designated government health centres across the country have no stock," says Dr Jaikumar.

While the Institute of Preventive Medicine, Hyderabad did say on the phone that they were out of stock, a phone call to King Institute in Chennai was answered with: "Yes, we have some vaccines. We cannot tell you how many. You need to come here and find out."

Going by the growing requests to pharmacies and PHI's "wait and see" approach, holiday-goers have little choice but to swallow the cynicism and stretch the wallet so that they can board their flight in peace.

[The situation in India appears to be very confused, with some governmental health institutions having no vaccine in stock, but others do. If pharmacies are able to get vaccine, it is not clear why government health facilities are unable to. - Mod.TY]

[It is particularly important that travelers from Asia are vaccinated before visiting YF endemic areas of Africa and South America to avoid bringing yellow fever home with them. Indian and many other Asian cities already suffer from dengue epidemics because they are full of the same mosquito, _Aedes aegypti_, that spreads yellow fever. - Mod.JW
