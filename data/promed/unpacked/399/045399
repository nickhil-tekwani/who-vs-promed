Tick-borne encephalitis in Chelyabinsk Oblast
---------------------------------------------
Since the beginning of the year [2009] a total of
316 people, including 52 children, have been
hospitalised in the Chelyabbinsk Oblast on
suspicion of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus
infection. Diagnosis of TBE virus infection has
been confirmed in 19 adult cases and in one
child. None had been vaccinated nor had received
emergency treatment with immunoglobulin. There
was one fatality, a 49-year-old habitant of Zlatoust.

A total of 15 126 people sought treatment at
health care facilities as a result of tick bites
this year, including 700 during the past week.
The greatest number of tick bites in 2009 were
sustained in upland forests -- in the Kusinski,
Nyazepetroski, Ashinski, Satkinski municipal
regions, and in the Miasski, Kishtimski, and the Verkhneufaleyski city okrugs.

The health care services of the Chelyabinsk
Oblast are responsible for implementing an
immunization program against TBE virus infection.
Up to the present 165 000 people, including 101
636 children, have been immunized. Tick
disinfestation treatments have been applied over
an area of 4000 hectares [9884 acres], including
598.8 hectares [1480 acres] of recreational land.
During July 2009 outdoor activities for children,
such as hiking and excursions, have been
restricted to these treated areas. The
Rospotrebnadzor [Public Health Agency] of
Chelyabinsk has indicated that that ticks can be
tested for TBE virus infection at the Chelyabinsk
Oblast Centre for Hygiene and Epidemiology
(address: 147 Svoboda St., Chelyabinsk).

[The TBE season is underway and the number of
cases is increasing, particularly in the
Chelyabinsk Oblast. TBE virus infection is
predominantly observed in those who have not been
vaccinated or received emergency immunoglobulin
treatment people who did not receive immunization
or emergency immune globulin. - Mod.NP]

[I am taking this opportunity to draw readers
interested in TBE to a recent review published in
the Journal of General Virology, titled:
Tick-borne encephalitis virus Â­ a review of an
emerging zoonosis K. L. Mansfield1, N. Johnson1,
L. P. Phipps1, J. R. Stephenson2, A. R. Fooks1 and T. Solomon3

The full text of this review is available at:

The following are some salient points relevant to the preceding report.

"During the last 30 years, there has been a
continued increase in human cases of tick-borne
encephalitis (TBE) in Europe, a disease caused by
tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). TBEV is
endemic in an area ranging from northern China
and Japan, through far-eastern Russia to Europe,
and is maintained in cycles involving Ixodid
ticks (_Ixodes ricinus_ and _Ixodes persulcatus_)
and wild vertebrate hosts. The virus causes a
potentially fatal neurological infection, with
thousands of cases reported annually throughout
Europe. TBE has a significant mortality rate
depending upon the strain of virus or may cause
long-term neurological/neuropsychiatric sequelae
in people affected. In this review, we
comprehensively reviewed TBEV, its epidemiology
and pathogenesis, the clinical manifestations of
TBE, along with vaccination and prevention. We
also discuss the factors which may have
influenced an apparent increase in the number of
reported human cases each year, despite the availability !
of effective vaccines."

"As an emerging zoonosis, there is currently
increasing interest in TBEV. In particular, this
has prompted the identification of particular
regions of the genome that may influence
phenotypic characteristics of the virus.
Recently, certain mutations that influence the
neuroinvasive capacity of the virus in mice have
been identified. This has suggested that
non-virulent variants of TBEV, which are highly
adapted to ticks yet sustain human population
immunity by inducing subclinical infections, are
found in the natural environment. Furthermore,
the virulent and attenuated viruses may co-exist
as quasispecies in the same TBEV population an
that conversion of neurovirulence during
tick/mammal adaptation of the virus is mediated
by selection from this quasispecies population rather than random mutagenesis."

"Increased temperatures have already allowed the
limit of _I. ricinus_ to extend north- and
westwards, thus fueling the prediction that TBEV
may also extend to previously unaffected areas.
Indeed, in South Korea it has been shown that
western TBEV is in a species of tick that is not
normally associated with this virus subtype, and
the detection of _I. persulcatus_ ticks in
Finland suggests a possible extension to the
previously known geographical range of this
vector. Conversely, in some areas, climate change
may actually disrupt the conditions required for
enzootic cycles of TBEV. However, in an age of
climate change, the increasing popularity of
outdoor pursuits and changes in land usage, this
is a risk that cannot be ignored."

"Active vaccination is the most effective method
for preventing TBE, with modern vaccines shown to
be safe and between 95 and 99 percent effective.
Currently, there are at least 4 vaccines
available against TBEV infection, which are
manufactured from purified,
formaldehyde-inactivated virus. These include:
Austrian 'FMSE-Immun 0.5 ml' and 'FSME-Immun 0.25
ml Junior,' German 'Encepur Adult and Children,'
and 2 Russian vaccines manufactured in Moscow and
Tomsk. The European vaccines are produced using
the Neudorfl (Austria) and K23 (Germany) strains
of the European subtype, whereas the Russian
vaccines are produced from the far-eastern strains." - Mod.CP]
