The Institute of Tropical Medicine of the Central University of Venezuela (IMT - UCV) detected on [5 Dec 2022], at least 20 cases of histoplasmosis, a lung infection caused by a fungus, in a whole group of rescuers who worked the torrential avalanche in Las Tejerías, in the state of Aragua in the north-central region of Venezuela, between [14 and 16 Oct 2022].

"We were able to detect the outbreak based on the epidemiological history of histoplasmosis: people are inhaling the air in the disaster area without much protection. The spores are disseminated by the movement of earth and enter the respiratory system," explained Dr Freddy Salazar, member of the medical mycology section of the IMT - UCV, and professor of microbiology at the Central University. The doctors of the mycology laboratory warn that there is an outbreak of histoplasmosis that, until now, has been underreported by the victims, rescuers, and anyone who was in the area of the 2022 disasters in Aragua, Anzoátegui, and the Capital District.

"There is a direct correlation between acute histoplasmosis infection and socio-environmental disasters such as the torrential avalanche that occurred in Las Tejerías 3 months ago," explained Dr Sofía Mata, director of the IMT-UCV medical mycology laboratory.

Histoplasmosis (also known as Darling's disease) is a systemic fungal disease that can range in severity from symptom-free to minor self-limited to life-threatening illnesses. Infection is quite common but clinical disease is not. The disease is seen in many areas of the world including the Americas, Africa, eastern Asia, and Australia. It is rarely seen in Europe. The fungus is found in soil with undisturbed bird droppings, in old chicken houses, in bat caves, and around starling, blackbird, and pigeon roosts. The fungus multiplies in bird droppings and bat guano. Disturbing these contaminated areas and the wind can easily transport infectious fungal particles. Infections in humans and animals are typically due to inhalation of airborne fungal spores. It is not transmissible from person to person.

The majority of infections (90-95%) are asymptomatic or self-limiting flu-like illnesses. Others may have symptoms associated with active pulmonary disease; night sweats, cough, fever, and weight loss. In some people, the fungus disseminates through the bloodstream to the spleen, liver, kidneys, mouth, eyes, or central nervous system. Disseminated histoplasmosis is especially dangerous in immunocompromised individuals and can result in rapidly fulminant disease. Over 50% of AIDS patients from endemic areas develop histoplasmosis. Symptoms typically appear within 10 days but may be shorter in heavy infections.

Histoplasmosis can be diagnosed by chest radiographs and laboratory cultures. A biopsy culture of the affected organ and blood cultures are best.

[As a review, the following was obtained from Medscape http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/299054-overview#showall:

"_Histoplasma capsulatum_ is a dimorphic fungus that remains in a mycelial form at ambient temperatures and grows as yeast at body temperature in mammals. Infection causes histoplasmosis. Although the fungus that causes histoplasmosis can be found in temperate climates throughout the world, it is endemic to the Ohio, Missouri, and Mississippi River valleys in the United States. Internationally, the fungus is predominantly found in river valleys in North and Central America, eastern and southern Europe, and parts of Africa, eastern Asia, and Australia.

"The soil in areas endemic for histoplasmosis provides an acidic damp environment with high organic content that is good for mycelial growth. Highly infectious soil is found near areas inhabited by bats and birds. Birds cannot be infected by the fungus and do not transmit the disease; however, bird excretions contaminate the soil, thereby enriching the growth medium for the mycelium. In contrast, bats can become infected, and they transmit histoplasmosis through droppings. Contaminated soil can be potentially infectious for years. Outbreaks of histoplasmosis have been associated with construction and renovation activities that disrupt contaminated soil. In addition, travelers to endemic areas are at risk for histoplasmosis because airborne spores can travel hundreds of feet.

"Most individuals with histoplasmosis are asymptomatic. Those who develop clinical manifestations are usually immunocompromised or are exposed to a high quantity of inoculum. _Histoplasma_ species may remain latent in healed granulomas and recur if there is impairment of cell-mediated immunity.

"Approximately 90% of patients are asymptomatic. If symptoms develop, onset occurs 3-14 days after exposure. Fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, abdominal pain, and chills are common symptoms; usually, histoplasmosis is self-limited. Individuals exposed to a large inoculum may develop severe dyspnea resulting from diffuse pulmonary involvement. Joint pain and skin lesions occur in 5-6% of patients, mostly in females. Enlarged hilar (the hilum is part of a gland or organ through which ducts, nerves, or blood vessels enter and leave) and mediastinal lymph nodes are present in 5-10% of patients. Cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and/or chest pain may be present and are related to the degree of compression on the pulmonary airway and circulation. Paratracheal involvement may cause cough or dyspnea because of compression on the trachea or bronchi." - Mod.LL
