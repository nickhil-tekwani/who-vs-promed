From: Avi Itzhaki <nogavi@netvision.net.il>

A febrile disease has been reported the last week in nine soldiers, a few
days after participating in a field exercise overnight, in the Negev
desert, in the south of Israel.
A number of the soldiers have been admitted to various hospitals in Israel,
all with high fever. In five of the soldiers the diagnosis relapsing fever
was made after an initial blood smear revealed spirochetes typical of the
_Borrelia_ spp.
All nine soldiers were treated with tetracyclines. A number of them
developed Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, which was expressed as rigor and an
elevated temperature after the first dose of the drug. One of the subjects
developed jaundice. As I know, no other complications were observed and all
nine soldiers are doing well.

[Dr. Itzhaki has indicated to me that the above information is derived from
his personal observations, a subsequent telephone poll of colleagues at
other hospitals, and that it has been confirmed by military authorities in
Israel. There are tick-borne and louse-borne forms of relapsing fever.
The latter is generally restricted to Ethiopia and the Sudan. Occasional
outbreaks of tick-borne relapsing fever among military personnel in Israel
have been reported during the past several decades, as have rare cases in
tourists returning home from Israel. Tick-borne relapsing fever is also
endemic in the southwestern USA. - Mod.ES
