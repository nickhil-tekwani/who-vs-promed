An outbreak of Streptococcus A has killed at least four people in the past
two months in Chicago's suburbs, and health authorities warned Sunday that
residents should be aware of the symptoms. Four men, aged between 43 and
90, have died from toxic shock syndrome that struck quickly after they were
infected with the bacteria, Streptococcus A, which commonly causes strep
throat. "The disturbing factor about the toxic shock syndrome cases is
that most did not have complaints of a sore throat prior to becoming
extremely ill," Kane County health official David Lucks told reporters.
Lucks did not characterize the fatal cases over the past two months as an
epidemic, although local media reports said two of the victims lived in the
same nursing home. In another case, a 43-year-old woman in the northern
suburb of Glencoe died recently from flesh-eating bacteria, a rare form of
the disease that attacks the flesh.
Health authorities warned residents to be alert to red skin rashes, as well
as persistent flu symptoms including a badly sore throat and sore joints.
Prescribing antibiotics at an early stage can halt the disease before toxic
shock or flesh-eating forms develop.

Five persons have died of invasive streptococcal infections (Group A) in
the Chicago area and another six have been made seriously ill. The
Illinois Health Department and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention are investigating to find the
source of the infections and learn whether the cases were related,
officials said.
A CDC spokesperson said that about 10,000 to 15,000 people in the United
States develop the illness each year, and about 2,000 die.
The most recent case, involving an elderly Aurora man, was diagnosed
Friday, Kane County Medical Director Dr. David Lucks said Sunday.

[A number of contributors have called this situation to my attention over
the past two days. I have delayed posting it since it is not clear the
extent to which this represents the expected incidence of invasive
streptococcal infections as opposed to a cluster of epidemiologically
related cases. The involvement of CDC personnel suggests that something
unusual may be occurring. - Mod.ES]
