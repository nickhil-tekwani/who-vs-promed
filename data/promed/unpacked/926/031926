Maize redness (MR), a disease causing midrib, leaf and stalk reddening, and
abnormal ear development in maize, has been reported from Serbia, Romania,
and Bulgaria for 50 years. Recent epiphytotics reduced yields by 40-90 per
cent in southern Banat, Serbia. Previously, it was suggested that MR
symptoms were caused by _Fusarium_ spp. or fastidious bacteria; however,
recently Duduk and Bertaccini reported the detection in symptomatic maize
plants of a stolbur phytoplasma (subgroup 16SrXII-A, _Candidatus_
Phytoplasma solani) with the highest sequence similarity to a stolbur
phytoplasma from Serbian pepper (_Capsicum annum_).
Although the epidemiology of MR is still unknown, maize hybrids showed
differential sensitivity to MR and insecticide-treated plots had reduced MR
incidence. Diseased fields in southern Banat were surveyed for potential
vectors of the phytoplasma during 2005 and 2006, and high populations of
_Reptalus panzeri_ (_Cixiinae_, _Auchenorrhyncha_) were found. In affected
fields, 20 per cent of the _R. panzeri_ individuals and 85 percent of
symptomatic maize plants carried the stolbur phytoplasma. When stolbur
phytoplasma-infected _R. panzeri_ were introduced into insect-free mesh
cages containing healthy maize plants, midrib and leaf reddening developed
on 48 per cent of plants and the stolbur phytoplasma was detected in 90 per
cent of the symptomatic plants. No symptoms or phytoplasma-positive plants
were found in cages without insects. These data indicate that MR symptoms
are associated with the stolbur phytoplasma. _R. panzeri_ is both abundant
in affected fields and can transmit the stolbur phytoplasma, indicating the
insect is likely to be a major vector of MR.

[2] Corn with symptoms of reddening: new host of stolbur phytoplasma
Date: Thu 7 Jun 2007

Recurrent epiphytotic outbreaks of a disease of uncertain etiology known as
reddening of corn (_Zea mays_) have occurred in some areas of Serbia during
the last 50 years. Affected plants show early and abnormal ripening, dry
precociously, and have poor, shriveled grains. Using molecular tools,
phytoplasmas were detected in diseased plants and their identity was
subsequently deduced as a subgroup 16SrXII-A strain by a variety of
supporting assays involving restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)
analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified 16S rDNA and tuf gene
sequences, selective amplification of phytoplasma DNA using primer pair
G35p/m, similarity of 16-23S intergenic spacer region (SR) sequences, and
similarity and phylogenetic analysis of 16S rDNA gene sequences. Presence
of stolbur phytoplasmas in corn with reddening symptoms is a new finding
not only for Serbia: it is the 1st report of stolbur phytoplasma in this
species worldwide.

[Phytoplasmas are intracellular bacterial plant pathogens belonging to the
group of mycoplasma-like organisms (MLOs). They lack a cell wall and, so
far, cannot be cultured in vitro.
Phytoplasmas can be transmitted by phloem-feeding insects and by grafting.
Methods used in disease management include vector control, use of clean
planting material, and resistant varieties. While phytoplasma taxonomy is
still being developed, stolbur phytoplasmas form a group related to
_Candidatus_ Phytoplasma solani, the potato stolbur phytoplasma. Stolbur
phytoplasmas have been reported from Europe and parts of Asia and Africa.
Members of this group affect a range of important crops including tomato,
capsicum, eggplant, strawberry, and grapevine (Bois noir, a disease causing
serious damage in central European vineyards). However, hardly any species
of monocotyledons have been recorded as hosts making this report an even
more important finding.
