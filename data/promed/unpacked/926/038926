Brucellosis has spread among cattle in the Lagodechi region of Georgia,
bordering on Azerbaijan, APA's Georgia bureau reports. The disease has
already infected 26 people, who are being treated. A decision was made to
cull ill animals.
The spokesman for the State Veterinary Service at the Azerbaijan
Agriculture Ministry, Yolchu Khanveli, told the APA that importation of
beef from Georgia to Azerbaijan is not expected to be banned. Khanveli said
that brucellosis has also been observed among cattle in Azerbaijan and
emphasised that, if beef is imported from any country, it is put under
quarantine for 40 days and examined. If any disease is revealed,
importation of beef will be banned.

According to Georgia's last semi-annual animal health report to the OIE,
covering the period Jan-Jun 2007, _Brucella abortus_ is present in the
country. No information on the situation (presence or absebce) of _B.
melitensis_ nor of _B. suis_ has been included in the report. According to
Georgia's report for 2006, however, _B. melitensis_ has been absent there
since 1997 (which was the last year of occurrence) and _B. suis_ since
1995. If the information in the newswire regarding the animal species
(cattle) is accurate, it is most probable that _B. abortus_, which is the
bovine-related species, is the one involved in the current human cases.
Nevertheless, past experience has shown that -- in translations from
Russian -- sometimes there is confusion between cattle and small ruminants
(which are the vectors of _B. melitensis_). Both _B. abortus_ and B.
melitensis_ are present in Azerbaijan (the status of _B. suis_ is not
known, but this pathogen is unlikely to be involved). In conclusion, _B.
melitensis_ should not be excluded as one of the 2 possible causative
disease agents in the current cases. Final laboratory results, as well as
additional information on the definite identity of the animal-species from
which the humans were infected, would be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
