EQUINE INFLUENZA - AUSTRALIA (03): QUARANTINE FAILURE

Systemic failures at all levels of the Australian Quarantine Inspection
Service (AQIS) and irresponsible behavior by private horse grooms,
veterinarians, and farriers have been blamed for last year's [2007]
devastating outbreak of equine influenza, which cost the horse racing
industry AUD 1 billion (USD 939 million).

The Callinan inquiry into the outbreak has found that the virus entered
Australia through infected horses brought in from Japan and taken to the
Eastern Creek Quarantine Station in Sydney. The report found that it then
spread to the general horse population as a result of unidentified grooms,
farriers, or vets who left Eastern Creek without bothering to shower or
decontaminate as required by quarantine rules.

The former High Court judge Ian Callinan also found that none of the AQIS
officers at the Eastern Creek station was checking whether people leaving
the facility were decontaminating themselves. The report amounts to an
indictment of the competence and internal management systems of AQIS and
the federal Department of Agriculture because Mr Callinan found that errors
and failures at all levels of these agencies contributed to the failure to
enforce decontamination requirements at the quarantine station.

"What I describe bespeaks an organisation that lacked clear lines of
communication between those responsible for formulating procedures and work
instructions and those responsible for implementing them; one in which
there was insufficient training and education in relation to the procedures
and instructions to be followed; one in which there was no checking to
ensure that those procedures and instructions were being implemented; and
one in which any business plan or other reporting system did not alert
senior management to these failures," the report said.

These included:
* Staff at the regional and national level were not checking whether the
rules were being implemented at the quarantine station.
* Staff at Eastern Creek had not been trained about their responsibilities.
* There was just one officer at the station responsible for horses and she
was also responsible for dogs and cats and had been told to give priority
to the dogs and cats.
* In April 2007 a national manager of AQIS was told the rules for horse
quarantine procedures were not being followed but did nothing to fix the
problem.

AQIS head stands aside
----------------------
Mr Callinan said ultimate responsibility for the breakdown lay with the
secretary of the agriculture department Conall O'Connell, the executive
director of AQIS Stephen Hunter, and the executive manager of quarantine
within AQIS Jenni Gordon.

Agriculture minister Tony Burke, who released the report today [12 Jun
2008] said that Mr Hunter had offered to stand aside. He said he had full
confidence in Dr O'Connell.

Mr Callinan recommended that an independent inspector-general of horse
importation be created with powers to spot-check and audit quarantine
procedures.

Mr Callinan also sheets home a share of the responsibility to the horse
industry itself because of the lax attitude many of those caring for horses
at Eastern Creek displayed towards decontamination procedures when they
left the station. "Those who treated and cared for the horses in Eastern
Creek ... must take some responsibility for the failure of quarantine.
Their failure to decontaminate themselves and their equipment contributed
to the probable means of the virus's escape from Eastern Creek."
