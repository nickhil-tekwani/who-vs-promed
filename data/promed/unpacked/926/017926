The region of Sao Jose do Rio Preto, to which Catanduva belongs, had twice
the number of confirmed cases of meningococcal meningitis, the most serious
type, in the 1st 8 months of this year [2008] as were seen throughout 2007.
In 2007 there were 12 cases altogether; this year 24 already, 7 of them in
Sao Jose do Rio Preto.

According to the State of Sao Paulo secretary of health, up to 26 Aug 2008,
264 cases of [meningitis] were registered in the region, 24 of which were
the meningococcal type. Last year [2007], from January to December, there
were 362 cases of the disease, 12 of which were the meningococcal type.

Only this month [August 2008], in Novo Horizonte there was one confirmed
case of meningococcal meningitis type C and in Urupes one death.

The secretaries of health are not planning mass vaccination.

[Making a quick calculation, the region shows no difference from the rest
of the state [in the overall meningitis rate], around 1.75 cases per 100
000 inhabitants, a rate consistent with historical values for the state.
If, however, further analysis of strains shows they are all the same
phenotype or genotype, then measures should be reconsidered. - Mod.LJS

There are at least 13 _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroups, based on the
antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides; infections due
serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W135 are most common.

Invasive meningococcal disease (bacteremia and meningitis) is a contagious
bacterial infection caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_. _N. meningitidis_
colonizes the nasopharynx, and is spread by respiratory droplets. Household
members and other close contacts who may be exposed to the index case's
respiratory excretions have the highest documented risk of secondary
disease during the 1st 7 days of a case being detected. Chemoprophylaxis is
recommended for those in close contact with a person with a meningococcal
infection to prevent secondary cases by eradicating _N. meningitidis_ from
the nasopharynx. Chemoprophylactic agents include rifampin, ciprofloxacin,
and ceftriaxone.

To control an outbreak, WHO (World Health Organization) recommends mass
vaccination with the appropriate vaccine in every involved district in an
attempt to induce herd immunity (whereby transmission is blocked when a
critical percentage of the population have been vaccinated
<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/>).

Immunity following meningococcal vaccination is serogroup-specific. All
serogroup polysaccharides, except B, are immunogenic in humans. There are
several different types of meningococcal vaccines. Polysaccharide vaccines,
which have been available for more than 30 years, exist against serogroups
A, C, Y, and W-135 in various combinations (such as, a bivalent AC,
trivalent ACW-135, and a tetravalent ACYW-135 polysaccharide vaccine).
There is a monovalent conjugate vaccine against serogroup C and a
tetravalent against serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135.

Except for one patient, the serogroups of meningococcus involved in the
current Brazilian outbreak are not specified in the report above, but
outbreaks in Brazil in the past have been both B and C (see ProMED-mail:
Meningitis, meningococcal - Brazil 19960125.0182). Perhaps no mass
vaccination program is being planned at present because serogroup B is the
main pathogen. We await more information on the nature of the serogroups
involved in this outbreak.
