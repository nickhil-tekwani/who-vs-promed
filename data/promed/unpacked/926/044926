[This outbreak is located approximately 500 km west of Beijing in the
Eastern part of Inner Mongolia (Lat: 40 49 00 N Long: 111 37 00 E).
Of course, with no N characterization of the virus yet, we cannot say
it is the same virus we have been hearing about in Romania and Turkey.
It would not be surprising, however, because we have seen the H5N1 in
Novosibirsk, Russia, Qinghai Lake in China and Hovsgol, Mongolia
earlier this summer. Dots are beginning to fall in place. One
wonders how many of the recent outbreaks across Eurasia fall along
the migratory flight paths of wild birds residing in the big Asia
lakes this summer. I wouldn't be surprised if someone is mapping
that question right now and I would love to hear from them. - Mod PC]
