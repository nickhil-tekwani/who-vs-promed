As noted by the Moderator, this media report regarding the recent launch of the Auckland Statement does not mention vaccination; the Statement itself however does.

The Auckland Statement is an urgent call to action for our governments and the community at large to come together and curb avoidable deaths caused by viral hepatitis -- including through setting targets for reducing transmission, increasing testing, and enhancing access to specific treatments.

For further information, readers can go to http://www.aucklandstatement.com.
