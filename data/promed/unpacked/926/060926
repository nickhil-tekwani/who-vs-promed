In Case of the Dead Otters, Evidence Points to Opossums
--------------------------
LOS ANGELES - Sea otters, dead and alive, have been washing up on the
California coast in record numbers for two springs, and scientists say they
are closer to solving the mystery.
The principal culprits, the scientists say, are _toxoplasma gondii_ and
_Sarcocystis neurona_, parasites that can cause fatal diseases in the
brains and nervous systems of otters and other animals. _Toxoplasmagondii_
which can affect humans too, spreads its hardy spores through cat feces,
while _Sarcocystis neurona_ is spread through opossum feces.
_Toxoplasma gondii_ had been widely thought to be the more prevalent
parasite. But in April, scientists confirmed that at least 11 of the 62
otters that were found washed up on the shore had died from exposure to
_Sarcocystis neurona_. The finding of the 62, most of which were dead, was
a record for a month, surpassing the one-month record of 48 last year. In
the 10 years before 2003, an average of 24 otters were stranded on the
coast each April.
Some otters died of exposure to _Toxoplasma gondii_ and some of exposure to
demoic acid, a toxin found in red tide algal outbreaks. Some otters were
too decomposed to determine the causes of death.
The 11 otters killed by _Sarcocystis neurona_ were found in a cluster of 14
around Morro Bay, halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Dr.
Melissa Miller, a wildlife veterinarian and pathologist for the University
of California, Davis, said she had never seen such a high number of otter
deaths attributed to _Sacrcocystis neurona_ in such a small area along the
coast.
Dr. Miller said she suspected that the otters encountered the parasite by
eating shellfish that carried it. The shellfish, she said, could have
picked up _Sarcocystis neurona_ from the runoffs of heavy rains in
February.Runoff has been shown to transport cat feces infected with
_Toxoplasma gondii_ to the ocean, where the spores are eaten by shellfish,
and then by otters, she said. Her theory is that the water might have
carried opossum feces in the same way.
Studies to investigate this theory are being conducted, she said.
Opossums are not native to California. According to the California
Department of Fish and Game, they were probably imported from Virginia in
the early 1900's so that people could hunt them.
"What's interesting about the opossum," Dr. Miller said, "is that they're
not even a native species. They're certainly naturalized, though, and not
hard to find around here."
Because the weather has largely been dry since May, fewer otters have
washed ashore. But Dr. Brian B. Hatfield, a marine biologist with the
United States Geologic Survey Western Ecological Research Center in San
Simeon, said the increased numbers each year were troubling.
In 1981, fewer than 1,500 otters were counted off California, said Dr.
Hatfield, an organizer of a survey that counts otters along the coast.
Those counts, while an imprecise measure of population, rose steadily
through the early 1990's but have stubbornly remained at 2,100 to 2,500
since 1995. Otters face threats from pollution, boats, fishing nets and
occasionally even sharks as well as from parasites.
"I guess a lot of us are more concerned with elevated mortality over all,"
Dr. Hatfield said. "Between 1985 and 1994, the mortality numbers were
between 4 and 6 percent of our spring population count. Since then, it's
averaged over 8 percent."
