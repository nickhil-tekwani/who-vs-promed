[The URL above, linking to indirect but reliable information on the LSD situation in Kosovo, has been accessed on Fri 1 Jul 2016. Kosovo, a 'disputed territory/partially recognised state' is not a member of the OIE, thus no official information on the outbreak described above is available in OIE's website. Kosovo is landlocked in the central Balkan Peninsula, bordering 2 LSD-affected countries (the Republic of Macedonia to the south, and Serbia to the north and east. Other neighbouring countries are Albania (south west) and Montenegro (west) -- both threatened by the disease.

The village of Zhuje is situated within the municipality of Kamenica in the district Gjilan, east Kosovo, adjacent to the Serbian border; see map at http://tinyurl.com/h67ff7g.

According to a recent report dated 30 Jun 2016, in the website Verio-Info (for the URL, see below), municipal authorities in the territory of Kosovo have been obliged to take various measures related to livestock markets and their surroundings, including disinfection, according to a decision of the Food and Veterinary Agency. The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Development, informed the citizens of the municipality of Kacanik that from Fri 1 Jul 2016, the cattle market should be closed, because of suspected cases of LSD. Kacanik is situated in southern Kosovo, closer to the Macedonian border (see map at http://tinyurl.com/z97mc3c). The report [in Albanian] is available at http://tinyurl.com/hcaoxvl. - Mod.AS]

The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) has adopted the amendments to the Directives for compulsory measures in order to prevent the introduction and spread of the very dangerous contagious lumpy skin disease in the territory of Montenegro from Serbia. The amendments have been proposed by the Directorate for Food Safety, Veterinary and Phytosanitary Affairs.

In "MARD Announcements" there is a reference to the basic instructions, which were adopted on 9 Jun 2016 following the 1st cases of LSD in Serbia, in order to prevent the spread of this dangerous disease from the territory of Serbia.

The Ministry said that the reason for the amendments are the fact that since the start of the epizootic in Serbia, LSD has spread to other areas, not mentioned in the list included in initial publication.

"In the amended instruction there are more detailed conditions of import and transit shipments transported through the territory of Serbia prior to entering into Montenegro", announced MARD.

Government departments were initially told that the disease was confirmed in cattle on 8 Jun 2016 in the Serbian municipality of Bujanovac in Pcinjski. The Ministry added that the disease has spread as of 28 Jun 2016 to the Jablanica and Zajecar districts.

"Given the high risk that the disease be transferred to the territory of Montenegro, in particular by the transport of cattle and cattle products the directive stipulated the ban on import to Montenegro of such items originating from different districts of Serbia", the Ministry indicated.

The statement says that the Directorate for Food Safety, Veterinary and phytosanitary matters constantly monitors the health situation in the region and promptly takes appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence and spread of the disease in the territory of Montenegro.
