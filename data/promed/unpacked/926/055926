Some 68 867 cases of viral conjunctivitis are registered in the epidemiological records of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Panama (Minsa).

Cases have been declining for 3 weeks, taking into account that in week 35 that ended on 2 Sep 2017, 7596 cases were reported, while the previous week had 10 560 cases accumulated in this epidemic.

The areas where the most cases have been reported are Colón, San Miguelito [Panamá division], Panama Oeste, and Panama Metro.

The director general of health of the Ministry of Health, Itza Barahona de Mosca, hopes that soon the cases drop to their normal behavior at the national level. However, he reiterated that the recommendations made should be maintained.

Among these, frequent hand washing with soap and water, do not share sunglasses or bath towels.

In addition, it is recommended that the population go to the nearest health center if they have itching, pain, swollen eyelids, grit eyes, or other discomfort.

Doctors do not advise self-medicating, as some people do, as it can worsen the condition and even cause other complications.

Grenada is confirming an outbreak of conjunctivitis otherwise called pink/red eye virus.

"With respect to the current increased incidence of this syndrome, the Ministry is reporting 41 cases in total throughout the entire island from the period January to August 2017. However, during the 1st week of September [2017], a total of 40 cases were identified in one particular health district setting off red indicators," the Ministry of Health said in a statement.

In July [2017], health officials reported that they were actively monitoring an outbreak of conjunctivitis in the region.

Senior Medical Officer, Dr Francis Martin said that the current outbreak is viral and can be transmitted by person to person.

"There is absolutely no evidence or confirmation that the outbreak is airborne," he said, urging the public to practice proper hygiene practices.

On [Tue 26 Sep 2017], staff from several pharmacies informed their clients that ophthalmologic solutions for the treatment of conjunctivitis are not available anymore.

The private clinics of the medical network of these pharmacies, as well as the IMSS [Mexican Social Security Institute], ISSSTE [Institute for Social Security and Services for State Workers], and multiple health centers, also have an extraordinary demand on consultations for conjunctivitis, which is already considered an epidemic disease in Mérida.

Doctors diagnose the disease and prescribe eye drops of ophthalmic chloramphenicol for control and healing, but when the people ask for the medicine the drugstore's employees report that they ran out of these products.

The problem is similar in municipalities in the interior of Yucatán State, because in the southern and eastern areas there is also a shortage of medicines for the treatment of this disease, and there are many cases of children and adolescents of school age who have been infected.

In the early days of this month [September 2017], conjunctivitis reached one of its highest "peaks" in Yucatán, with a daily record of 157 new official diagnoses.

Statistics released on Tue 26 Sep 2017 by the National System of Epidemiological Surveillance (Sinave) of the Health Secretariat reflect the seriousness of the problem: until [9 Sep 2017], health sector institutions had confirmed 18 794 cases of conjunctivitis in Yucatán, compared to 15 511 in the same dates of [2016].

This year's [2017] cases will far exceed the official records of previous years. In 2016, the official count was closed with 20 409 patients. In 2015 there were 20 543. [By 2014, the condition was practically under control, when,] for example, only 4508 cases were reported.

José Antonio Aguilar Pérez, an epidemiologist with the IMSS, says that the real numbers could reach twice what officials say, because many people do not go to public authorities to receive care and, therefore, their cases do not enter the statistics.

The 18 794 diagnoses so far in 2017 are equivalent to 75.4 per day, on average, about 5.7 cases per hour. Yucatán is one of the states that had the most growth of cases in 2017.

Authorities insist that this is an outbreak, not an epidemic, although the reality is that more and more people are coming to clinics for consultation for conjunctivitis.

Cases in the Peninsula
----------------------
Rudy Coronado Bastarrachea, head of Sanitary Jurisdiction no. 2 (in Valladolid, Yucatán), reported that 300 cases of conjunctivitis have been recorded so far in their demarcation, more than twice as many as in the same period last year [2016], when 133 were registered.

The official added, "That number is without taking into account the non-reported cases."

He also remarked that in several communities where there are health modules there is no longer stock of ophthalmic chloramphenicol, and they already asked the Health Secretariat for 1000 units of the medicine to solve the problem.

Coronado Bastarrachea recalled that normally the health modules generally only keep 5 units of chloramphenicol, which are now insufficient to face the number of cases.

The chloramphenicol is available in some health centers, but in others such as Xcan, Chemax, Chikindzonot, Yokdzonot, Valladolid, and some stations in Tizimín, the medicine is no longer available.

María de la Luz Mendoza Sologuren, director of the General Hospital of Valladolid, said that there are still some units in the pharmacy, but they could soon [run out because of the high demand].

The Quintana Roo Health Secretary Alejandra Aguirre Crespo confirmed that in recent days 14 474 conjunctivitis cases were registered. "The rebound of cases is concentrated in the municipalities of Benito Juárez (Cancun) and Solidaridad (Playa del Carmen); where they report 7660 and 2000, respectively," she said.

For his part, the director of the General Hospital of Cancun, Ignacio Bermúdez Melendez, anticipated that for the month of October [2017] an outbreak of conjunctivitis is expected in the Northern Zone of Quintana Roo, so already enough medicine was requested for the attention of the patients.

The official considered as natural the outbreak of this disease in the Yucatán Peninsula, so he recommended to the population to take extreme hygiene measures and not to greet by handshake, when transmitting the bacterium by human contact.

For his part, the governor of Quintana Roo Carlos Joaquin said that at least the south of the state has sufficient supply of medicines for conjunctivitis.

The disease
-----------
Conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the conjunctiva, an almost transparent membrane that covers the white part of the eye and also the eyelids on the inside.

Although it is transparent, the conjunctiva has blood vessels that cover the sclera (white part) of the eye.

Any agent that triggers an inflammation will cause the dilation of these blood vessels, until manifested in red eyes.

Generally that inflammation is caused by viruses, but it can also have its origin in a bacterium or an allergy. Only in the allergy case the disease is not contagious, and with the bacterial case complications can arise if not properly treated.

Dr Enrique Ureña Bogarin, Head of Quintana Roo Medical Delegation, explained that the conjunctivitis causes the sensation of sandstones in the eyes, redness, discomfort to light, swelling of the eyelids, and secretions. In case of presenting these symptoms the person must go to the nearest medical unit.

He also recommended not visiting crowded places, washing hands frequently, not sharing personal items such as towels, dishes, and glasses. Avoid handshakes, hugging, and face-to-face contact.

Numerous Latin American and Caribbean countries have been reporting outbreaks of conjunctivitis since late 2016. According to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)/WHO as of epidemiological week (EW) 29 of 2017 [week ending 21 Jul 2017; http://tinyurl.com/yboo6wzs], 13 countries and territories of the Americas reported increases in conjunctivitis cases: the Bahamas, Brazil, Costa Rica, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mexico, Panama, Saint Lucia, Saint Martin, Suriname, and the Turks and Caicos Islands. The Dominican Republic has been hit particularly hard, recording a total of 66 626 cases of conjunctivitis were reported through the end of May [2017], representing a 62 percent increase compared with the same period of 2016 (http://tinyurl.com/ydbnmr69).

Also see ProMED mail Conjunctivitis - South America: Nicaragua 20170901.5290146, which reports on the outbreak in Nicaragua, South America.

The Yucatán authorities in the report state that this is an outbreak and not an epidemic.

A disease outbreak is the occurrence of cases of disease in excess of what would normally be expected in a defined community, geographical area, or season. An outbreak may occur in a restricted geographical area, or may extend over several countries.

An epidemic occurs when an infectious disease spreads rapidly to many people in a population.

The CDC doesn't have epidemic thresholds for every disease and actually tends to frown on some of the media hair-splitting over the outbreak-epidemic line. Its online glossary states that "outbreak" can actually be used interchangeably with "epidemic" and that the former is often preferable merely because it's a less frightening term. - Mod.LK]
