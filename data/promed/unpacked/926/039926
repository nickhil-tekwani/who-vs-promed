Avian influenza - latest information
------------------------------------
As a precautionary measure, the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands and the
Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) have quarantined a commercial farm
in British Columbia, where a duck has tested positive for an avian
influenza-type virus. It is important to note that this recent development
does not indicate a threat to human health.
The positive sample was confirmed today (18 Nov 2005) at the Provincial
Animal Health Centre lab in Abbotsford. The sample will now be sent to the
National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease (NCFAD) in Winnipeg for further
testing to fully characterize the virus and confirm its strain and
pathogenicity. Testing is being conducted on a priority basis; results will
be communicated as soon as they are available.

Avian influenza has been found in a duck on a farm in south western British
Columbia, but the bird appeared to pose little risk to public health,
officials said on Friday.
Officials were alerted to the duck on Thursday, and said initial testing
indicated it was an H5-type avian influenza virus, but more testing was
needed to identify the specific strain, said Dr Jim Clark of the Canadian
Food Inspection Agency.
Health officials around the world have been on the watch for the H5N1
strain of the virus that experts fear may mutate just enough to allow it to
be easily transmitted among humans. There are 9 known N strains of H5 virus.
Officials said the virus was discovered in routine tests after the bird was
sent to them for unrelated reasons by a commercial packing house. "We do
know that the flock that this bird was taken from appears to be healthy,
and is for all [intents and] purposes well," Clark told reporters.
The farm in Abbotsford in the Fraser Valley east of Vancouver has been
quarantined and animal health inspectors were visiting farms within a 3
mile (5 km) area, a move officials said was standard procedure after such a
discovery.
Officials said the farm where the duck was raised had allowed its birds to
be outside of barns, which meant the animal might have come in contact with
wild waterfowl that are known to carry the disease. "The finding of avian
influenza in a domestic duck flock is not surprising. Birds are known
carriers of the virus [and] are commonly raised under conditions that may
expose them to avian influenza viruses carried by wild birds," Clark said.
A sampling program of birds in a different area of British Columbia over
the summer found 24 per cent tested positive for H5 bird flu, although none
of those birds showed signs of being ill and none was carrying the H5N1 strain.
That program was begun because of an outbreak of an H7 type of bird flu in
the Fraser Valley in 2004. That virus spread quickly among farms and
eventually caused officials to cull 16 million poultry in the area. "In
this particular incidence, we have no reason to believe that there is a
virus that is going to cause any significant risk on this particular farm
itself or farms nearby," said Ron Lewis, British Columbia's chief veterinarian.

[A reader queried the method of testing to determine that H5 has been
diagnosed. The method was RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction) and PCR. We look forward to hearing more about this latest
infected duck. - Mod.TG]
