[The 2011 FMD epizootic in Israel, commencing 1 Mar 2011, comprised a
total of 20 outbreaks, all but 2 in the northern district (Hazafon),
adjacent to the Lebanese, Syrian and Jordanian borders. Maps are
available at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=10345
(1st outbreak) and
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=10529
(19 following outbreaks). The epizootic was characterised by a very
low morbidity rate and practically an absence of mortality; most
probably, this was due to the long prevailing general vaccination
policy. Methodic application of the vaccination in dairy cattle
resulted in the absence of disease in adult dairy cattle.

The epizootic, declared resolved at the end of August 2011, followed
the "traditional" seasonal pattern of FMD in Israel (19980722.1384).

The causative FMD serotype O virus was genotyped by WRLFMD as topotype
ME-SA, Genotype/strain PanAsia-2ANT-10, known to be widely circulating
in the region (isolates from Iran, Afghanistan, Turkey, and Bulgaria
have been genotyped at WRLFMD). Notably, the Israeli isolate was found
to be closely related to the strain from wild boars on the
Bulgarian-Turkish border.

Based upon genotyping results, the epizootic seemed to include 2
clusters. A discussion on their respective possible route(s) of
introduction into Israel was included in the commentary to archived
post 20110717.2163. In view of the location of the primary outbreaks
in areas with significant populations of wild boar, the role of the
latter in the epidemiology of the epizootic, particularly its early
stages, remains to be studied.

EU's research project "FMD-DISCONVAC" [Development, enhancement and
complementation of animal-sparing, foot and-mouth disease
vaccine-based control strategies for free and endemic regions], which
started 1 Apr 2009 for the duration of 39 months, included, within its
"Workpackage 6," objective 5: "To study the role of gazelles and wild
boar in FMDV transmission under natural conditions." Workpackage 6 is
led by CVI (The Central Veterinary Institute, Netherlands). The other
participants are IIL (Indian Immunologicals Limited) and KVI (Kimron
Veterinary Institute, Israel). Further details are available at
http://fmddisconvac.net/workpackages/wp6.

It will be of special interest to note whether epidemiological studies
in wild boar in Hazafon district, including serology, have been (or
are being) carried out, and to obtain their results.
