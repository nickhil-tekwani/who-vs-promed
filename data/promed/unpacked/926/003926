New Ebola virus discovered by CDC
----------------------------------------------
Inside high-containment laboratories on Clifton Road in Atlanta, GA,
scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
this week [26-30 Nov 2007] identified what appears to be a new strain
of the deadly Ebola virus. A team of CDC disease detectives on Friday
[30 Nov 2007] was preparing to travel to a remote area in western
Uganda to help contain an outbreak that so far involves 51 people,
including 16 who have died.

"The most important consideration is to have a sense of what's been
going on with the outbreak: How many people are affected, where and
when the outbreak is moving, and trying to stop transmission," said
Dr. Eileen Farnon, the CDC epidemiologist who will be part of a
5-member field team assisting the Uganda Ministry of Health.

Dr. Thomas Ksiazek, chief of CDC's Special Pathogens Branch, said
Friday it's not yet known whether the Ebola virus causing the current
outbreak in Uganda's Bundibugyo District is any more or less deadly
than the 4 previously known strains. "There is very little
information about the eventual outcome in the cases] that have been
confirmed so far," Ksiazek said. Ebola, an often-fatal hemorrhagic
fever, causes internal and external bleeding in its victims. Both
humans and non-human primates can be infected.

Samples arrived at CDC's Biosafety Level 4 labs in Atlanta on Monday
[26 Nov 20007]. By Tuesday [27 Nov 2007], Ksiazek said, it was
apparent this was not a typical Ebola virus. Dr. Stuart Nichol, a CDC
special pathogens team leader, said some molecular tests for Ebola
were coming back negative, when another type of test came back
positive. The CDC lab was then able to extract a small fragment of
the virus' genome. "It looks, based on this, like it's a new species
of Ebola," Nichol said Friday evening. Previously, there were only 4
known types of Ebola. The Sudan and Zaire species were discovered in
1976. A strain called Reston was identified in 1989 among monkeys
imported to a lab in Virginia. And in 1994, the Ivory Coast strain
was identified. Depending on the strain, the death rate varies.
Ebola-Zaire kills about 80 percent of its victims, while the Sudan
strain kills about 50 percent, Ksiazek said. Ebola Reston is not
lethal for humans. - Mod.CP]

New Ebola strain kills 2 more in western Uganda
--------------------------------------------------------------
Another 2 patients have died from the Ebola virus in western Uganda,
bring the toll to 18, an health official said Saturday [1 Dec 2007],
as the authorities struggled put the disease under control.
"Cumulatively, there are 18 deaths and 61 cases," said Sam Zaramba,
the country's top government physician. A total of 19 patients were
quarantined in Bundibugyo hospital near the border with the
Democratic Republic of Congo, which itself has had harrowing
experience of the virulent disease [but not this strain of Ebola
virus - Mod.CP].

"Those admitted are mainly health workers and those who attended to
the patients," Zaramba told AFP. "The situation is not yet under
control. The main challenge we are facing is detecting cases and
following up who those who made contacts with the patients," Zaramba
explained. The authorities on Friday [30 Nov 2007] said the outbreak
was an unknown strain after analysis was done on tissue samples at
the laboratories of the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.

Initial field probes showed the outbreak [had been] ongoing in
Bundibugyo district since September [2007], the World Health
Organisation said. On Saturday, Rwandan authorities announced they
had tightened border health controls to prevent [the disease] from
travelling across the frontier from western Uganda.

Ebola is a highly contagious disease that can have fatality rates as
high as 90 percent, as there is no vaccine or treatment. The disease
spreads mainly through human fluids, notably blood. An outbreak
killed at least 170 people in northern Uganda's Gulu district in
2000. Another in recent weeks killed at least 26 people in the
Democratic Republic of Congo's West Kasai region. The Ebola virus was
1st identified in 1976 in Sudan and in a nearby region of Democratic
Republic of the Congo (then Zaire). Outbreaks of Ebola have also
occurred in the Ivory Coast and Gabon. Since then, experts have said
the disease is usually containable because it kills its victims
faster that it can spread to new ones.

[An unusual feature of this outbreak is that: "Those admitted [to
hospital?] are mainly health workers and those who attended to the
patients," It would be interesting to know the basis for the WHO
statement that the outbreak may have been developing since September,
although the first confirmed cases were not identified until November.
