2018/19 Northern hemisphere influenza vaccine effectiveness - children and adults
----------------------------------------------------------------------
We saw the ProMED-mail post [cited above] related to early season findings of 2018/19 influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 hospitalizations among children in Hong Kong, published in the journal Eurosurveillance on 31 Jan 2019.

Your readers should also be aware of earlier findings from the Canadian Sentinel Practitioner Surveillance Network (SPSN) published in Eurosurveillance on 24 Jan 2019.

The earlier Canadian VE estimate against A(H1N1)pdm09 illness in children 1-8 years of age requiring outpatient medical care ([vaccine effectiveness] VE = 91%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 67-98%) is very similar to that subsequently reported from Hong Kong in children 6 months-17 years of age requiring inpatient care (VE = 92%; 95% CI: 82-96%). In fact, most of the influenza cases in the Hong Kong report were also young children, with nearly 80% under 6 years of age.

Although the report from Hong Kong was confined to children, the report from the Canadian SPSN showed VE to be substantial across all age groups, with an overall VE against medically-attended outpatient A(H1N1)pdm09 illness of 72% (95% CI: 60-81%). The majority (about 60%) of participants contributing to VE analyses in Canada were working-age adults 20-64 years-old, in whom VE was 68% (95% CI: 51-80%).

Consistent with global trends, sequencing analysis of viruses collected by the Canadian SPSN revealed considerable genetic diversity among circulating clade 6B.1 viruses of A(H1N1)pdm09; however, a single dominant drift (immunologic escape) variant was not identified, also consistent with the substantial VE observed.

While A(H1N1)pdm09 activity remains elevated in several regions across the northern hemisphere, and while awaiting VE estimates from other networks later in the season, such early indications of substantial vaccine protection in both children and adults warrant further sharing.

The Canadian VE estimates are available at https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2019.24.4.1900055

The Hong Kong VE estimates are available at https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2019.24.5.1900056

[ProMED is very thankful to Dr Skowronski and colleagues for this important contribution on the effectiveness of the seasonal influenza vaccine for the Northern hemisphere for 2018-19 season, which shows data comparable between the 2 studies. - Mod.UBA]
