A popular nonprofit riding program, Westernaires, with about 230 horses in its program, has been hit with a strangles outbreak that threatens the financial solvency of the organization. Over 80 of the equines in their care have contracted the disease. Westernaires is a "mounted precision drill organization composed of Jefferson County, Colorado, youngsters from 9 to 19 years of age". They were founded in 1949 and have been serving the greater Denver area since then.

"Strangles is a highly contagious equine disease that's like strep throat," Westernaires director Glen Keller told reporters. "It's common among horses, but it's not contagious to people or other animals. It is very contagious among horses and they get it by contact, either by touching each other or drinking out of the same water." Horses that have recovered from strangles are contagious for up to 6 weeks, and the organization is looking at a long and costly quarantine and rehabilitation process.

A voluntary quarantine has been put in place to prevent the entire herd from contracting the disease. The loss of rental and lesson fees have led to an estimated loss of USD 15 000 per week for the organization. The most recent available 990, 2016, shows a total cash reserve of just over USD 330 000, but the director is worried. "Even when you run a nonprofit you have to prepare for a rainy day," Keller said. "We've tried to prepare, but it will certainly impact us in the long run, likely eliminating our ability to maintain equipment and things like that or what we use to transport the kids."

[The state Colorado of can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=5014775,4365. Jefferson County in central Colorado can be seen on the map at http://geology.com/county-map/colorado-county-map.gif. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ

This kind of situation is very difficult for such an organization. Hopefully the communities associated with this area will step up and help this organization treat and take care of these animals.

_Streptococcus equi equi_ is highly contagious and produces high morbidity and low mortality in susceptible populations. Transmission occurs via fomites and direct contact with infectious exudates. Carrier animals are important for maintenance of the bacteria between epizootics and initiation of outbreaks on premises previously free of disease. Survival of the organism in the environment is dependent on temperature and humidity; it is susceptible to desiccation, extreme heat, and exposure to sunlight, and must be protected within mucoid secretions to survive. Under ideal environmental circumstances, the organism can survive 7-9 weeks outside the host. Paddocks and barn facilities used by infected horses should be regarded as contaminated for about 2 months after resolution of an outbreak.

The incubation period of strangles is 3-14 days and the 1st sign of infection is fever (103-106 deg F/39.4-41.1 deg C). Within 24-48 hours of the initial fever spike, the horse will exhibit signs typical of strangles, including mucoid to mucopurulent nasal discharge, depression, and submandibular lymphadenopathy.
