At least 7 cases of anthrax virus were detected in 2 villages under
Kutra Gram Panchayat in Kutra block of Sundargarh district, official
sources said today [12 May 2010]. Four persons, including a
4-year-old girl, have acquired symptoms of anthrax disease from
Kusumdih village, while 3 cases were detected from nearby Kiringasira
yesterday. All affected persons were admitted to the community health
centre at Kutra, and their condition was stated to be improving.

The affected persons were [aged 22, 22, 40 (Kiringsira village), 20,
26, 65, and 4 years old (Kusumdih village)], the sources said.

A medical team with sufficient medicines and health workers today [12
May 2010] rushed to the 2 affected villages, and door to door health
check-ups have started. The villagers with suspected cases of anthrax
were also given preventive medicines. All precautionary measures are
being taken to prevent the spread of the disease, Dinabandhu Panda,
in-charge of Kutra CHC, who is camping in affected villages, said.

People who consume the meat of dead herbivorous animals like cows,
goats, and pigs, or who even only touch their hides, can become
infected by _Bacillus Anthracis_ bacteria. The poor tribals of 2
villages ate and handled a dead cow and a dead sheep a week ago, Panda said.

[As you will see from our previous reports from Orissa, there is a
long Orissan history of human infections consistent with eating
contaminated meat. If you are going to prevent human cases, the most
cost-effective method is to vaccinate your livestock, especially
cattle. You can lecture, preach to, beg folk to not eat meat from
sick animals, but if they are poor and malnourished, you are talking
to an empty room. They don't listen, and if they do, they forget.
Vaccinate! And do it proactively, not retroactively. - Mod.MHJ]
