In the last few weeks 2 cases of salmonellosis have occurred with
duck eggs being blamed as the source of infection. A warning about a
food poisoning outbreak related to duck eggs was issued by health
bosses last week [week of 18 Apr 2011], according to The Herald of
Ireland.

The infection took 18 people to hospital in 2010 and now a further 2
cases have been reported in the last month, 1 in the east and 1 in the
west of Ireland. The latest cases follow a nationwide outbreak of
_Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium DT8 associated with duck
eggs in 2010 where 32 people contracted the infection. [A
hospitalization rate of 18 in 32 cases, 56 percent, is quite high for
salmonellosis - Mod.LL]

The 2010 cases were spread right across the country and
microbiological evidence pointed to duck eggs as the most likely
culprit. Further investigations identified the bug in several
egg-laying duck flocks and control measures were put in place. In
addition, the Minister for Agriculture signed a new law to control
this infection in ducks and duck eggs. The measures included a
salmonella control plan, testing, sampling and registration
arrangements.

There were fears that infection might reappear when the laying season
began again in the spring. Ducks naturally produce fewer eggs in
winter because of falling temperatures and light levels.

The Herald reports that consumers are advised to check guidelines for
the safe handling, storage, and cooking of duck eggs. They need to be
cooked with greater care than hens' eggs and should only be eaten when
both white and yolk are solid, say health experts. Dishes containing
them should also be cooked until they are piping hot all the way
through and duck eggs should not be used for lightly cooked items like
mayonnaise.

[Duck eggs are larger than hen eggs and richer in flavor, lending a
creamy depth to baked dishes. The shells of duck eggs are slightly
tougher to crack. The tougher shell gives duck eggs a longer shelf
life, about 6 weeks in the refrigerator. The yolk is larger in
proportion to the white than that of a chicken egg.

We commonly associate raw or poorly cooked chicken eggs (alone or in
recipes) with a risk of salmonellosis acquisition. The risk is also
present for the eggs of other fowl such as ducks (as shown in this
report), ostriches, and quail.
