Re: Avian Influenza - Eurasia (37): Saudi Arabia, Falcon
-----------------------------------------------
The report of H5N1 from falcons in Saudi Arabia and their possible
infection by smuggled falcons from China or Mongolia is especially
notable because, when coupled with an earlier documented incident
involving H5N1-infected eagles smuggled from Thailand to Belgium
(ProMED 20041025.2891), these reports show a demonstrated potential
for H5N1 being moved globally through illicit falconry trade networks.
US Fish & Wildlife Service investigations have shown that there is a
long standing and well established illegal global trade in falcons
and other raptors and that as long ago as 1984, individual falcons
caught from the wild could command prices of USD 10 000 - 50 000 from
buyers in Europe and the Middle East.

NGOs have estimated that the illicit trade in falcons from Central
Asia to the Middle East and Gulf states may involve as many as 14 000
or more birds annually and say that individual falcons of the most
sought-after species can bring prices of USD 500 000 or higher. News
media reports from October 2004 said that Russian police had
intercepted and confiscated a consignment of 127 Saker falcons worth
an estimated USD 4.5 million from a commercial aircraft at a Russian
military air base in Kyrgyzstan.

There's a lot of smuggling of Sakers from Central Asia to the Middle
East; and what are they likely to be fed on? As I said in an earlier
message, who'd be likely to be in the Erhel Lake region, Mongolia?
People after Sakers for the Middle East.
I seem to recall that the H5N1-infected Mountain Hawk-eagles smuggled
from Thailand to Belgium were believed to have been fed infected
chicken just before the flight. So perhaps this is how the Erhel
Lake, Mongolia outbreak came about.

[See background on Saker falcons at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saker>,

The above appreciated comments shed light on a less known but
significant manifestation of global animal disease dynamics. The
control upon international trade in animals, captive wildlife
included, is the responsibility of national Veterinary Services. The
need for capacity building of such services -- especially at disease
sources -- was highlighted during the 17-18 Jan 2006 International
Pledging Conference on Avian and Human Pandemic Influenza in Beijing.
It was suggested that the evaluation of National Veterinary Services
will be prioritized. The evaluation is crucial for the preparation
and the design of national investments to be made in order to address
the prevention and control of emerging and reemerging diseases linked
to globalization and to enable the determination of national needs on
capacity building. - Mod.AS]
