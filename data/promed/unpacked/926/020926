Perak records alarming increase in dengue cases
--------------------------------------------------------
The State has recorded an alarming increase in dengue cases in recent weeks.
Up to 5 Sept, 612 cases have been reported. Although this represents a 17
per cent decrease from the 737 cases reported for the same period last
year, it is nevertheless a cause for concern as more areas have been
identified as breeding zones. State Health and Environment Committee
chairman Datuk Lee Chee Leong said 57 locations had been declared as
epidemic areas with more areas potentially becoming breeding grounds. Most
of the cases which have been reported were detected in the city and town
areas, accounting for 465 of the total 612 cases. The highest number of
cases were from the Ipoh city area which had 142 incidences followed by
Manjung with 91 cases and Kinta Barat with 74 cases.
In his statement, Lee said the area which recorded the highest increase in
the number of dengue cases was the Hulu Perak district which saw an
alarming 400 per cent rise in the number of cases, followed by the Batang
Padang district with a 61.4 per cent increase and the Kinta district with
36.4 per cent. More than half of all victims were adults and to date there
has been one death as a result of dengue haemorrhagic fever in Hulu Perak.
Lee said one of the main causes for the spread of dengue was the
lackadaisical attitude of the people who disregarded the importance of
cleanliness.
Containers left standing with water provided excellent breeding grounds for
the Aedes mosquitoes. Construction sites also make good breeding grounds.
Enforcement activities have constantly been carried out and 542,483 houses
have been inspected for the year, with 4,945 found to be breeding the
mosquitoes.
A total of 2,783 houses were issued compound notices, resulting in fines
amounting to RM 172,805. Officers also inspected 577 construction sites and
issued 45 compound notices, collecting RM 4,610 in fines.
