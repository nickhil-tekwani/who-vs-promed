More than 300 cattle culled following TB outbreak
-----------------------------------------------
There has been an outbreak of Tuberculosis (TB) on the Eastern Cape. 4
farms belonging to one farmer have been placed under quarantine. Hundreds
of TB infected cattle from the Tsitsikamma in the Eastern Cape are being
slaughtered.
Every 2 years, dairy cows are routinely tested for TB. This time, they
tested positive. There is no cure for the disease in animals, and they are
now being culled at the Eastern Province Livestock Agency abattoir in Port
Elizabeth.
Tissue samples have been sent to Onderstepoort to determine the strain. TB
affects mainly the lungs, but it can also spread to other parts of the body.
Werner Kruger, a state veterinarian, said that "what I've seen is that the
spread of the disease was very severe and rapid, because most of their
lungs were infected, about 75 percent, whereas [of] the carcasses, only
about 4 percent were directly affected. So, I think the infection itself
hasn't been around for long, possibly within the past year."
TB can be transmitted through unpasteurized milk. This airborne disease can
easily spread to other cattle. More than 300 infected animals have already
been slaughtered. Another 150 will be culled next week.
