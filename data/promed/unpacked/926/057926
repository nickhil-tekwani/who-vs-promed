Koi herpesvirus (KHV) disease has been confirmed in carp at Knightsland Farm Lake, Chase Cross Road [Romford, Essex county, England].

The site is now subject to statutory controls to prevent or limit the spread of the disease.

The Fish Health Inspectorate (FHI), acting on behalf of the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) has issued an order prohibiting the movement of fish to, from and within the fishery complex.

A spokeswomen for FHI said: "Fishery equipment disinfection and movement control measures are in place and anglers must ensure that they comply with all biosecurity measures within the designated area.

"KHV is a serious viral disease of fish, and is notifiable in the United Kingdom.

"KHV affects all varieties of common and ornamental carp -- _Cyprinus carpio_ -- and can result in high rates of fish mortalities."

Clinical signs of KHV disease may include white or necrotic patches on the gills, rough patches on the skin, sloughing mucous and sunken eyes.

Residents noting deaths in carp or carp hybrids, or symptoms of KHV, should immediately contact the FHI.

"Anyone who imports, keeps, fishes for, or retails carp -- common and ornamental -- and carp hybrids should take precautions to prevent the spread of KHV," she added.

[Koi herpesvirus disease (KHD) has been reported throughout the world. The disease is transmitted by fish-to-fish contact and it is also possible that the disease can spread through contaminated water, nets and other equipment. As other herpesvirus, KHD has the capacity to remain latent in the infected fish and become activated and cause disease when some stressors trigger it. More information on KHD is found in OIE's Aquatic Manual chapter (2009 update), which is available at http://web.oie.int/eng/normes/fmanual/2.3.06_KHVD.pdf. - Mod.PMB
