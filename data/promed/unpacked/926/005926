ISA virus detected in Magallanes
--------------------------------
The National Fisheries Service (Sernapesca) has declared that there has
been an outbreak of the infectious salmon anemia (ISA) virus in a farming
center in the region of Magallanes.

In compliance with biosafety regulations, after receiving the notification,
the owner of the farm, Salmones Magallanes, will have to remove the
contaminated fish from its facilities. The company will have to harvest the
salmon or remove the fish cages where the outbreak was declared. In the 1st
case, Salmon Magallanes has a maximum of 15 days, and in the 2nd, 7 days.

The procedure chosen by the company will be overseen by Sernapesca
inspectors in order to ensure compliance, which had previously overseen
various infringements for breaches of the rules, reports Estrategia.

Currently in the Magallanes region, 10 active aquaculture centers are
operating in seawater. Of these, 8 contain Atlantic salmon and 2 contain trout.

In February [2010], Sernapesca issued a provision establishing joint health
management measures in this area and the Chilean Antarctic, taking breaks
coordinated in an area where the ISA virus was detected (Resolution no.
93/2010).

Last October [2010], a legislation that defines additional restrictions on
the crops (validation of the methods of inactivation of the mortalities,
the demands of contingency plans, among others) was established for centers
in the affected areas (Resolution no. 1739/2010).

In addition, Henry Clifford, one of the creators of AquaAdvantage, which
aims to produce genetically modified salmon, will visit the country to
participate in the workshop 'Salmon: Myths and realities', to be held on 16
Nov 2010 on the Chinquihue campus at the University of Los Lagos, in Puerto
Montt. Clifford is the current vice president of AquaBounty Technologies,
the US company that created the modified Atlantic salmon, which some
critics call the "Frankenfish".

[The following statement was used as the moderator comment in ProMED-mail
posting "Infectious salmon anemia - Chile 20090715.2526".

"Infectious salmon anemia (ISA) is a disease of farmed Atlantic salmon
(_Salmo salar_) caused by the orthomyxovirus infectious salmon anemia virus
(ISAV). ISA primarily affects fish held in seawater or fish exposed to
seawater. However, indications of disease outbreaks in fish held in fresh
water have also been reported. The disease may appear as a systemic and
lethal condition characterized by severe anemia and hemorrhages in several
organs. The most prominent signs observed are pale gills, exophthalmus
[protruding eyes], distended abdomen, and petechiae [blood spots] in the
eye chamber; skin hemorrhages in the abdomen and scale edema [swelling] may
occur. The major findings on postmortem examination are circulatory
disturbances in several organs caused by endothelial injury in peripheral
blood vessels.

"These clinical manifestations of ISA are found in 4 organs: the liver,
kidney, gut, or gill. The liver manifestation is characterized by dark
livers caused by hemorrhagic liver necrosis. The kidney manifestation is
characterized by moderately swollen kidneys with interstitial hemorrhaging
and tubular necrosis. The gut manifestation is characterized by dark red
guts caused by hemorrhaging within the intestinal wall but not into the gut
lumen. In addition to being pale, the gill manifestation includes, in some
cases, accumulation of blood, especially in the central venous sinus of the
gill filaments. Lesions in the liver and gut are easily visible while
lesions in the gills and kidney are less obvious. In some ISA outbreaks,
one of the organ manifestations can dominate, while in other outbreaks all
manifestations can be found. In individual fish all manifestations may be
found to some extent. Outbreaks dominated by either the liver or kidney
manifestation appear to be most common. Hematocrit less than 10 in end
stages may be observed. Diseased Atlantic salmon presenting with anemia and
circulatory disturbances should be examined for ISAV infection, if there
are no other, obvious causes to explain their condition.

"Mortality during an outbreak of ISA may vary significantly. Daily
mortality in affected net pens may initially range from 0.5 to 1 per cent,
but may increase with time. Cumulative mortality ranges from moderate to
high and may exceed 90 per cent in severe cases. The disease usually starts
in one net pen and it may take many months before the disease develops in
neighboring net pens. Although natural outbreaks of ISA have been recorded
in farmed Atlantic salmon only, subclinically infected feral Atlantic
salmon, brown trout, and sea trout (_Salmo trutta_) have been identified.
ISAV has also been detected in 2 marine species, pollock (_Pollachius
virens_) and cod (_Gadus morhua_)." - Mods.AS/TG
