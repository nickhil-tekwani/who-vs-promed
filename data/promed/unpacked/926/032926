Avian influenza has killed a young girl in Cambodia, the 1st human victim
of the virus in the poor southeast Asian nation in almost a year, while
China said on Friday a woman in the city of Shanghai had died from it.
Jordan became the latest Middle East country hit by an outbreak of the
virulent H5N1 virus in poultry, but said no people had been infected.
Avian influenza, which has spread from Asia to the Middle East, Africa and
Europe, remains essentially an animal disease but can infect people who
come into contact with sick poultry. The World Health Organisation (WHO)
[see below] confirmed the death of the girl in Cambodia, taking the known
death toll from the virus to 104 since it re-emerged in Asia in late 2003.
The victim, aged 3, who lived in a village in Kampong Speu province about
40 miles (60 km) west of Phnom Penh in Cambodia, had been in contact with
sick and dying chickens, officials said. She died on Tuesday [21 Mar 2006].
Her death took Cambodia's human death toll from bird flu to 5. The
country's last victim was a 20-year-old woman who died in a Vietnamese
hospital in April 2005.
7 other people in the village who had either been in contact with the girl
or sick poultry were showing some signs of fever, although there was no
cause for panic, local WHO spokeswoman Megge Miller said. "It looks like
another one of those isolated incidents. There aren't any alarm bells at
the moment," she said.
The child's 23-year-old mother said she still had no idea what had killed
her daughter, an indication that bird flu public education campaigns in one
of Asia's poorest nations still have a long way to go. "Other children in
the village played with the dead chickens more than my loved one," she told
Reuters by telephone. "Why are they not sick, and why did my daughter die?"

As of 24 Mar 2006, the Ministry of health in Cambodia has confirmed the
country's 5th case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus.
The case, which was fatal, occurred in a 3-year-old girl from Kampong Speu
Province, west of Phnom Penh in the southern part of the country. The child
developed fever on 14 Mar 2006. Her condition deteriorated rapidly and she
was hospitalized in Phnom Penh on 20 Mar 2006. She died on 21 Mar. Samples
from the girl tested positive for H5N1 infection at the Pasteur Institute
in Cambodia.
A team of officials from the Ministry of Health and WHO have investigated
the situation in the remote village where the child lived. Backyard poultry
began dying in the village in Feb 2006, and chicken deaths have continued.
The child is known to have played with chickens, including some showing
signs of illness.
The investigation found 7 residents with fever but no respiratory symptoms.
All had a history of recent contact with diseased birds or had been
involved in caring for the child. Although none of these people presently
shows symptoms compatible with H5N1 infection, all have been placed under
medical observation as a precaution. Samples have been taken from these
people and other close contacts of the child. Test results are expected
next week. The Ministry of Agriculture has taken samples from chickens in
the area. Testing is under way.
This is the 5th confirmed case in Cambodia and the first in almost a year.
The 4 previous cases, all from the adjacent Kampot Province which borders
Viet Nam, and all fatal, occurred between the end of Jan 2005 and mid-April
2005.

China's Health Ministry confirmed on Fri [24 Mar 2006] that a 29-year-old
woman in Shanghai had died of avian influenza, the official Xinhua News
Agency reported. The woman was a migrant worker who was initially said to
have died of "pneumonia of unknown cause." The city government said it
suspected avian influenza on Thursday [23 Mar 2006].
This latest death is the 1st known case [of avian influenza] in Shanghai
and brings to 16 the number of human bird flu cases and to 11 the number of
deaths that have been confirmed in China.
Epidemiologists fear that bird flu could mutate to a form that could pass
easily among humans, potentially triggering a pandemic in which millions
could die. The Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention
confirmed that the woman tested positive for H5N1, Xinhua said.
