South Sudan's Ministry of Health announced that 1720 cholera cases including 37 deaths have been reported in South Sudan since the start of the outbreak, according to data current to Sat 14 Jun 2014.

In a weekly media briefing on the cholera situation, Dr Lul Riek, the chairman of the national task force to combat the outbreak, said the 5 most affected areas last week were in Gumbo with 98 cases, Tongping with 40 cases, Gudele One with 38 cases, Gurei with 27, and New Site with 31. The other 3 affected payams were Rajaf with 114 cases followed by Northern Bari with 77 cases and Munuki also with 77. Dr Lul said due to the increase of cholera, 2 centers of cholera treatment have been opened in Nyakuron West and Gumbo.

Dr. Lul said that week-to-week data show a decline in the number of cases since late May 2014, but he said they are still very much concerned by steady numbers of new cases. He said that people not obeying health regulations have been the main problem causing fatalities, many of which happened in homes rather than health facilities.

"We still have the problem of people's attitude that when we ask them to wash their hands before preparing their food, some people continue to forget it," the doctor said. The population continues to be at high risk of contracting cholera because they continue to drink unsafe water, consume un-hygienically prepared food, practice open defecation, and participate in handling and burial of people who have died from cholera, he said.
