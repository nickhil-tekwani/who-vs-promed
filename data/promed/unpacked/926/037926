In a recent post recounting the measures being taken by several European
nations to protect their citizens against Belgian chicken and eggs
"containing high levels of dioxin, a highly toxic chemical linked to
cancer," I was struck by the fact that the response from Italy, a country
"keenly aware of dioxin after an explosion in 1976 at an agricultural
chemical factory in the town of Seveso in northern Italy caused more than
300 grams of dioxin to be released," was reacting less vigorously than most
of the other countries mentioned. To learn more about the Italians'
experience with dioxin, I did a quick search for relevant abstracts
available on-line from the U.S. National Library of Medicine through
PubMed. Some of what I found may be of interest to ProMED-mail readers,
especially those who live in Europe and enjoy eating chickens or eggs. In
brief:
1. The tragic unintentional exposure in 1976 in Italy resulted "in the
highest levels of the toxicant ever recorded in humans" (ref A). Some
"serum 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) levels in residents of
the contaminated zones in Seveso, Italy, in 1976, ... are among the highest
ever reported and thus this population serves as a benchmark for comparison
of human exposure and potential adverse health effects" (ref B). Twenty
years after the exposure, the geometric mean plasma TCDD level among those
most exposed was 53.2 ppt (parts per trillion) whereas the level in
non-exposed persons was 4.9 ppt (ref A).
2. A study of cancer mortality from 1976-1991 among residents of Seveso
"found no increase for all-cancer mortality or major specific sites (for
example, respiratory among males, breast among females)." The investigators
did find excesses in cancers of some specific sites when subjects were
stratified by sex but there was no clear dose effect and they concluded
only that "The specific excesses that we observed were not explained by
bias or confounding, and their association with dioxin exposure is
plausible" (ref C). A review published in 1998 concluded that
"chloracne...was the only [early effect established with certainty" and
that although long-term studies uncovered excesses in cardiovascular
mortality, respiratory diseases, diabetes, cancer of gastrointestinal sites
and of the lymphatic and hematopoietic tissue, "Results cannot be viewed as
conclusive" (ref D).20
3. Although there seems to be no doubt in the lay press about dioxin's
status as a carcinogen, there seems to be some controversy in the
toxicology literature (ref E).20

The European Union(EU) is taking action after it was discovered chickens in
Belgium had been exposed to high levels of dioxins through their feed. It
is not the first time dioxins have provoked a heath scare in Europe - an
entire population was exposed following an explosion at a chemical plant in
Seveso, Italy, in 1976. What are the risks?
What are dioxins?
Dioxins are a group of chemicals known to increase the likelihood of
cancer. An unwanted byproduct, they are formed when heating processes
create certain chemicals - chlorine is the best known. Environmental
campaign groups describe them as among the most dangerous toxins known.
Scientists are working to establish their exact toxicity, but a draft
report from the US Environmental Protection Agency indicates dioxins are
considered a serious threat to public health.
In 1997, a WorldHealth Organisation group declared the most toxic dioxin -
2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, or TCDD - a class 1 carcinogen,
meaning it causes cancer in humans.
Where are they found?
Just about everywhere - they are present in the atmosphere, soil, rivers
and the food chain.
Where do they come from?
Waste incinerators and chemical and fertiliser manufacturing plants mainly.
They have been more widespread since the introduction of a new chlorine
production technique in 1900. However, volcanoes and forest fires also
produce dioxins.
What is a safe level of exposure?
In 1990 the WHO set a safe daily exposure level of 10 picogrammes per
kilogram of body weight.
A picogramme is one millionth of a millionth of a gram. However, following
further studies this was re-evaluated in 1998 to one to four picogrammes
per day.

How great is the health risk?
The first disease associated with dioxins was the extreme skin disease
chloracne. It causes acne like pustules to form across the body and can
last for several years.
Most concerns now lie with the potential of dioxins to cause cancer, but
they are also suspected of affecting reproductive health, lowering sperm
counts, causing behavioural problems and increasing the incidence of
diabetes. There is a growing body of research indicating that dioxins can
cause such diseases.
In particular, a peer-reviewed study of the population of Seveso found
that, in the 10 years following the explosion, both men and women more
likely to have cancer. It looked at people who lived in an area some
distance form the plant that was not evacuated. Both sexes were more likely
to have cancers of the blood system, while women were also more likely to
have cancer of the gall bladder and liver system. Also of concern is the
effect dioxins can have on unborn children and infants, as they can be
passed through the placenta or carried in breast milk.
How do they get into food?
In living organisms, toxins reside in fat. This means they can persist in
the food chain through a process called bioaccumalution. They are mainly
found in meat and dairy produce, but are also found in poultry, fish and on
unwashed fruit and vegetables.
Fish accumulate dioxins through exposure to water - dioxins are repelled by
the water and attach themselves to the fatty fish Unless - as was the case
in Belgium - feed becomes contaminated, animals are usually exposed to
dioxins in the air settling on their food. They accumulate in the fatty
tissue of animals, and the longer that animal lives, the greater the build
up. Dioxins in the air also land on fruit and vegetables, but washing can
get rid of these - they are not absorbed into the plant itself
What is the outlook?
Pressure from environmental lobbyists has led to companies changing their
practice and a reduction in dioxin emissions.
Following the 1998 WHO meeting on dioxins, Dr Maged Younes, head of risk
assessment in the organisation's Programme for the Promotion of Chemical
Safety, said such steps were proving effective. "Recent exposure data show
that measures introduced to control dioxin release in a number of countries
have resulted in a substantial reduction in intake of these compounds in
the past few years," he said.
"This is evidenced by a marked decrease in dioxin levels in human milk, as
found in an exposure study conducted by the WHO European Centre for
Environment and Health, with the highest rates of decrease being observed
in areas which had the highest initial concentrations."
Campaigners continue to press for tighter controls.
