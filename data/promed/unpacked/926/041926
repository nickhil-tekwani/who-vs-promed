[WHO has changed the format of this app between 7 and 8 Jan 2015, so it no longer has a column showing the "number of cases in past 21 days". Also note that the cumulative totals for suspected cases in Guinea have fallen from 34 on 28 Dec 2014 to 17 on 8 Jan 2015, whereas it might have been expected that the number would increase with time. - Mod.JW]

Ebola: more than 70 cases registered in Dubreka (official)
----------------------------------------------------------
Dubreka prefecture, located about 50 km [31 miles] from Conakry, has so far registered a total of 75 confirmed cases of Ebola, with 33 deaths and 337 contacts to follow, confirmed Tuesday [6 Jan 2015] by phone to Guineenews by Dr Fode Cisse, Director of health of that prefecture. According to health authorities, this new outbreak of Ebola disease in Dubreka prefecture reflects the mobility of contacts and especially the reluctance of people in some localities such as Falessade and Falessa Fotonkon to allow sensitization and contact tracing. ... -- more.

[3] Amiodarone rebuttal by Emergency
Date: Sat 3 Jan 2015 [ProMED regrets the delay in posting]

Facts, lies and tales about Ebola
---------------------------------
A recent article, Mon 22 Dec 2014, in The Guardian [posted on ProMED in Ebola virus disease - West Africa (233): WHO, S Leone, Liberia, susp 20141225.3053835] reported several groundless conjectures, lies and unverified information about Emergency's work [Italian NGO] in the fight against Ebola in Sierra Leone. To deal with their assertions individually will be helpful.

It is false that "mortality rate in the Lakka Centre is around 67 percent". The Lakka Centre has been operational as both isolation and treatment unit from 18 Sep to 10 Dec 2014. The overall case fatality rate (CFR) of the Centre, where 122 patients with a confirmed EVD diagnosis have been treated, is 57.4 percent, with 52 survivors and 70 dead (13 of these patients arrived in very critical conditions and died within 24 hours of admission).

It is false that amiodarone is an untested drug in humans. It has been used in clinical cardiology for 40 years, prescribed to millions of people, even in critical conditions and in patients in need of intensive care. In fact, very few drugs have as well-known a safety profile as amiodarone, confirmed by such a long term use for safety and efficacy in humans as potential treatment or prevention.

It is false that Emergency used amiodarone in a "reckless" way outside "carefully controlled conditions". On the contrary, amiodarone has been used with an intensive ICU patients' monitoring: non-invasive arterial pressure, ECG (including Q-T interval determination), heart rate, oxygen saturation, electrolytes.

It is false that Emergency stopped administering amiodarone upon request from DFID [UK Department for International Development]. DFID is not involved in technical assessing nor determining patients' therapies or clinical procedures. The study named EASE (Emergency Amiodarone Study against Ebola) has been registered on ClinicalTrials.gov and already approved by the ethical committees of the IRCCS [International Red Cross & Red Crescent Societies of Reggio Emilia, Italy, and by the ethical committee of the Italian National Institute of infectious diseases.

It is false that DFID withdrew NHS [UK National Health Service] staff from Emergency's facility. Emergency agreed with those who were not feeling comfortable that they could stop their cooperation with the organization.

It is false that "the main focus of the Emergency staff was to ensure the patients received these drugs instead of ensuring they were adequately hydrated, clean and comfortable". As stated in WHO and Emergency clinical guidelines, patients' rehydration is one of the most important components of the supportive treatment. Patients have been aggressively rehydrated with several liters of infusions per day to restore volume and electrolytes balance.

It is false that Emergency does not ask for patients' consent. For 20 years in all Emergency's facilities worldwide patients, or relatives when appropriate, are requested to provide their informed consent for any medical or surgical procedures.

Observational data on patients who have received amiodarone at the Lakka Ebola Treatment Unit managed by Emergency can be summarised as follows: 48 patients received the drug in dosages aiming at obtaining a serum plasma concentration up to 10 uM [microMoles], in order to develop a significant anti-viral action, without exceeding 20 mg/kg/day which is the maximum suggested dosage in clinical cardiology. Amiodarone has been administered I.V. [intravenously] in the initial 3 days and orally in the following 7 days of treatment.

We recorded 24 deaths in patients who were receiving amiodarone (6 of them presented in very critical conditions and died within 24 hours from admission). The mortality rate [sic; actually case fatality rate (CFR) - Mod.JW] within this group has been 50 percent. (42.8 percent if we exclude those 6 early deaths, 18 dead out of 42 patients.) As previously stated, the overall CFR of the Lakka Centre was 57.4 percent, out of 122 patients, and 52.3 percent if we exclude the 13 patients who died within 24 hours of admission.

As far as drug safety is concerned, we have observed minor side effects in 2 patients only: in one case, systolic pressure dropped by 20 percent, in the other we registered bradycardia ([slow] heart rate 60 beats/min). Despite the fact that both patients remained asymptomatic [sic], our clinicians decided to stop administering amiodarone.

These preliminary observations provide, in our opinion, a solid ethical and scientific ground to state that amiodarone is not "harmful" for the patients and might even be beneficial, reinforcing the rationale for a clinical trial.

Emergency believes that human rights belong to everybody and that every patient is entitled to receive high standard and free of charge health care. This is Emergency's ethics, practiced daily in all our facilities worldwide. ... -- more

Ebola: Recovery needs to start now
----------------------------------
The social and economic impact of the Ebola crisis will be felt up to a decade after the disease has been eradicated. In Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, virtually every sector has suffered as a result of the epidemic. For example, based on UNDP's most recent estimates, Liberia could experience negative GDP growth for the 1st time since the war ended 11 years ago, reaching minus 1.8 percent.

In all 3 countries, air traffic is down, mining and palm oil concessions have been badly affected, and so have farming and small trade, crippled by quarantines and movement restrictions. The crisis is impairing the ability of governments to raise taxes and invest in infrastructure and social services.

For instance, more than 800 000 women will give birth during the next 12 months. But with the severe shortage of health facilities and professionals, compounded by the fear of getting infected in a clinic, many could die without proper care. Millions of children are out of school because their classes have shut down. [But Liberia plans to reopen schools in February 2015. - Mod.JW]

Whereas life before Ebola was starting to improve following years of crisis and political conflict, people are now struggling again with uncertainty. Besides the personal loss, the immense majority are finding it difficult to make a living and get services given the shrinking economic opportunities and stigma.

In Sierra Leone, for instance, per capita income fell by USD 71 between January and October 2014, while in Guinea, 42 000 jobs have been lost in the potato business as of November 2014. This number is only a small portion of the job losses in the affected countries.

While we must continue to focus on stopping the epidemic, treating the sick and preventing new outbreaks, it is critical that the international community works together to help the 3 countries recover.
- 1st, by reviving local economies and the livelihoods of millions of individuals and households.
- 2nd, by helping to overhaul public health systems, including investments in decentralized health facilities, staff, equipment and research.
- 3rd, by transforming the way development is planned and decisions are being taken.

Recovery cannot be an afterthought. Survivors are already facing the daunting task of rebuilding their lives. Investing in recovery is the smartest way to look forward again. If we work now to build more robust economies and health systems, while creating stronger societies and institutions, we will minimize the chance of seeing another Ebola crisis.

2 Jan 2015 Germany: Rapid detection test
http://www.dw.de/rapid-ebola-detection-certainty-in-minutes/av-18167029

[Researchers in Germany have developed a new test that identifies a protein unique to the Ebola virus from a patient's throat swab within minutes. To carry out the test you do not need any specially qualified staff or a laboratory with expensive equipment. An important advance. I wonder whether a multiplex assay could be designed to detect Marburg and Lassa viruses at the same time. - Mod.LK]

[Meeting Announcement and Call for Participation
Modeling the Spread and Control of Ebola in W. Africa
-----------------------------------------------------
Historic Academy of Medicine at Georgia Tech, Atlanta, Georgia, USA, 22-23 Jan 2015

This meeting will highlight concepts, challenges, and results arising from the use of models to predict the spread and facilitate the control of Ebola in W. Africa. For more information, go to http://bioinformatics.gatech.edu/ebola-modeling-workshop or email: <ebola-modeling-workshop@gatech.edu>.

I am continually amazed at the number of people who continue to model Ebola based on what are acknowledged to be grossly misleading statistics. But perhaps that means I need to attend the conference. - Mod.JW
