Measles is an insidious infectious disease that typically strikes children. It can be deadly. The disease comes on as a fever and runny nose, and causes an uncomfortable blotchy, rash all over the body. It's airborne, so it spreads quite easily, too; it just takes an infected person breathing or coughing near someone who is unvaccinated. And according to a new New England Journal of Medicine article, measles is making a comeback here: More measles cases have been reported in the US this year [2014] than during any year in the past 2 decades.

The author writes that there are 2 key reasons for this resurgence: 1st, though significant progress has been made in reducing global measles incidence, there is still substantial circulation of the virus in other countries. Susceptible U.S. residents who travel to countries where measles is endemic or epidemic and susceptible residents of those countries who travel to the United States are bringing the virus here.

2nd, an increasing number of parents in this country are hesitant to have their children vaccinated, and such hesitancy has resulted in an accumulation of unvaccinated populations who can become infected and maintain transmission. This is especially worrisome, considering how easily measles spreads. In a recent article in The Week, the author points out that readers should be more worried about measles than Ebola. One case of Ebola, on average, leads to the infection of 1.5 to 2.2 other people. "By contrast, a person with measles is infectious for several days before they become sick, and a person with measles will on average infect 12 to 18 additional people." Worldwide, 330 people die of measles every day. This resurgence in America is a concern.

[It is presumed that the reporter is referring to: "Mounting a Good Offense against Measles," by Walter Orenstein, M.D., and Katherine Seib, M.S.P.H.; N Engl J Med 2014; 371:1661-1663; 30 Oct 2014; DOI: 10.1056/NEJMp1408696 http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1408696. This article is reproduced here more or less in full on account of it's lucid statement of the situation.]

These authors write that: "There are 2 major reasons for this resurgence [of measles]. 1st, though significant progress has been made in reducing global measles incidence, there is still substantial circulation of the virus in other countries. Susceptible U.S. residents who travel to countries where measles is endemic or epidemic and susceptible residents of those countries who travel to the United States are bringing the virus here. 2nd, an increasing number of parents in this country are hesitant to have their children vaccinated, and such hesitancy has resulted in an accumulation of unvaccinated populations who can become infected and maintain transmission.

"Measles is one of the most contagious of the vaccine-preventable diseases, with reproduction rates (R 0) estimated at 12 to 18, meaning that the average person with measles would be capable of infecting 12 to 18 other people if all of his or her contacts were susceptible. The herd-immunity threshold (the population immunity level needed to interrupt transmission) is usually calculated as (R 0-1)/R 0; for measles, this threshold is on the order of 92 to 94 percent to prevent sustained spread of the virus, higher than the thresholds for almost all other vaccine-preventable diseases.

"Some measles outbreaks have occurred in populations with even higher immunity levels. In addition, virtually every measles infection becomes clinically apparent, resulting in some combination of cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, high fever, and erythematous maculopapular rash. Complications are common and may include otitis media, diarrhea and dehydration, pneumonia, encephalitis, and even death. In the United States, it has been estimated that 0.2 to 0.3 percent of people who become infected with measles die from its complications. In the developing world, the case fatality rate can be as high as 2 to 15 percent. As recently as 2012, an estimated 122 000 children died from measles.

"The licensure of the 1st live attenuated measles vaccine in 1963 offered the opportunity to prevent this health burden. Current vaccines are highly effective, about 94 percent for a single dose, if administered in the 2nd year of life. With 2 doses administered on or after the 1st birthday and at least one month apart, almost all immunocompetent children are protected against measles for life.

"Because of its high level of contagiousness, measles is the indicator disease for weaknesses of an immunization program. With gaps in immunization coverage, measles is often the 1st vaccine-preventable disease one sees, indicating that a theoretical problem, low immunization coverage, has been converted into a real problem of disease, disability, and deaths. A focus on eliminating measles in the United States led to our modern immunization program. Though we encountered multiple failures along the way, analysis of those program failures led to solutions and success, and, for the most part, we are still achieving high immunization coverage in most of the population and low morbidity from vaccine-preventable diseases.

"Measles harms not only the individual but also the community. Persons with measles can transmit infection to children who are too young to be vaccinated yet are still susceptible, to people with legitimate contraindications to vaccination (such as severe immune deficiency), and to the few people who remain unprotected against the disease despite being vaccinated. In the United States, emergency efforts to prevent imported measles from reestablishing endemic transmission can be costly. Such responses often include labor-intensive efforts to identify, find, and quarantine exposed and possibly susceptible persons, the creation of emergency vaccination clinics, and other measures.

"A 2004 outbreak in Iowa resulted in estimated costs of USD 140 000 for local and state health departments to investigate, contain, and treat just 2 patients with confirmed cases and their more than 1000 identified contacts, including people who were exposed to the index case during air travel returning from India; that estimate doesn't include outside resources, such as those of the airlines or the federal government. The estimated cost of addressing 7 confirmed cases of measles during an outbreak in 2 Arizona hospitals was USD 800 000. A large portion of that amount represented the cost of furloughing health care workers who had no evidence of measles immunity; the figure excludes the public health expenses incurred by state and local health departments and other entities involved in containing the outbreak.

"To prevent measles from being reestablished as an endemic disease in the United States, we must 1st do better in vaccinating our at-risk population. That means ensuring that vaccine is accessible to all who need it -- especially to people traveling outside the Western Hemisphere and those traveling to the United States from countries with circulating disease -- and convincing hesitant families both that the vaccine is safe and effective and that measles is not trivial and can result in serious illness.

"The military adage that "the best defense is a good offense" applies well to measles. The National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC) recently released a report emphasizing that supporting global immunization programs not only has humanitarian value but also protects our own domestic health security. This year [2014] alone, there were at least 48 U.S. importations of measles from more than 30 countries, most notably, the Philippines, which saw an outbreak involving more than 47 000 cases and was the source of an estimated 22 importations to the United States. The NVAC advocates that the United States support efforts to eliminate measles in each of the World Health Organization's 6 geographic regions. In fact, although we have not yet set a global goal of measles eradication, all 6 regions have their own such goal.

"It may be premature to embark on another global eradication effort until polio eradication is achieved; however, much more can be done to reduce measles transmission in its current reservoirs. We can increase support for improving global routine immunization programs so that they include 2 doses of measles vaccine in their schedules and for ensuring that there is adequate vaccine and infrastructure to conduct special mass-vaccination campaigns against measles. Support is also needed for strengthening the global laboratory network to permit detection and analysis of which measles strains are persisting and which have been eliminated.

"We must also overcome vaccine hesitancy. Despite the overwhelming evidence that vaccines -- including the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine -- are safe, too many people still believe that greater risk is posed by vaccinating than by not vaccinating. Research is needed on how best to address public concerns about vaccine safety. The lack of apparent measles disease in the United States -- which is attributable to the enormous success of the U.S. immunization program -- gives a false sense that there is little or no threat. Efforts are also needed to educate the public that measles is a serious disease which no one need suffer from, and that vaccines are highly effective in preventing it."

The Hawaii State Department of Health has confirmed another case of measles in Maui, bringing the number of cases in Hawaii to 10. Four cases have been identified in Maui and 6 on Kauai. The latest case was discovered and is believed to not be related to the other cases.

All the reported cases involve adults or children who have not been vaccinated. "The bottom line is that if you have not been vaccinated and if you have not had the disease, get vaccinated and protect those around you," said Dr. Sarah Park with the State Department of Health. Health officials say the measles is significantly contagious and will infect 90 percent of the people who are not immune and come into contact with it.

[A map of the Islands of Hawaii, showing the location of Maui can be accessed at: http://www.hawaiicity.com/hawaiimap/. The Hawaii State Department of Health has confirmed another case of measles in Maui, bringing the number of cases in Hawaii to 10. Four cases have now been identified in Maui and 6 on Kauai. The latest case is believed to be unrelated to the other cases.

Previously, the Hawaii state Department of Health had reported 4 additional cases of measles on Maui and Kauai, bringing the total number of confirmed measles cases in these 2 separate clusters in Hawaii to 7 and the total reported cases for the year [2014] to 9. These additional cases are an example of how contagious this disease is and how quickly it can spread. - Mod.CP

The Vanuatu government is undertaking a major child immunisation programme with the aid of UNICEF, the World Health Organization, and AusAID.

UNICEF's chief in Vanuatu, Diane Araki, says the integrated package is an important strategy for improving child health and survival. She says it aims to reach about 17 500 children and has been prompted by an outbreak of measles.

Ms Araki says just half of the children in Vanuatu have received measles vaccine so far.

[Vanuatu, a string of more than 80 islands once known as the New Hebrides, achieved independence from France and Britain in 1980. Most of the islands are inhabited; some have active volcanoes. Vanuatu is mountainous, and much of it is covered with tropical rain forests. Like most of the area, it is prone to earthquakes and tidal waves. Most of the people live in rural areas and practice subsistence agriculture.

Vanuatu has been spared the unrest which has befallen neighbouring countries such as the Solomon Islands and Fiji, although the largest island, Espiritu Santo, experienced a brief insurrection in 1980. Australia, a key donor, has pushed for good governance and economic reform in the islands.
