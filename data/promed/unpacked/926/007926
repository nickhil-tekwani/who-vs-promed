DYSENTERY, SIMULTANEOUS DOG & HUMAN: REQUEST FOR INFO

Over the weekend, my dog and I were presented with a query from her
veterinarian about the most likely cause of bloody diarrhea occurring
simultaneously in both dog and owner. It seems that he and his colleague
have been seeing a remarkable number of patients AND their owners with
symptoms of acute bloody diarrhea of late. As a human specialist, I could
implicate the usual suspects of _Campylobacter jejuni_ and EHEC, and add
appropriate species among _Shigella_, _Salmonella_, _Vibrio_ and _Yersinia_
to be more complete yet while omitting the absurdly improbable, but I am
left wondering:
1. In an affluent, well-insured community, how likely are adult patients
to suffer an episode of genuine acute inflammatory diarrhea (as opposed to
watery non-inflammatory) without going to their physician and getting it
diagnosed?
2. Does the epidemiology of acute inflammatory diarrhea in pet dogs differ
from that of humans?
3. Is there a high enough frequency for the transmission of infection from
dog --> human that veterinarians should issue specific warnings and
recommendations to the owners when this is encountered? Since the pet
owners were able to mention their symptoms to this veterinarian, I suppose
we can assume that illness in the human either preceded or was concurrent
with that of the dog. Therefore, infection was either from a common food
source, or transmission was from human --> dog (e.g. dog drinking from
toilet).
4. Are there important carrier states for any of these infectious agents
in dogs?
Of interest, the infectious agents in this differential are generally
reportable when encountered from humans, but in Pennsylvania, only
_Salmonella_ is reportable in animals (see
<http://padls20.nbc.upenn.edu/user/general.htm>).
Also, I found it interesting that the treatment approach used by this
veterinarian was sulfasalazine - not an agent we use in humans when the
episode is acute, or the cause is presumed infectious (the only modern
indications are chronic inflammatory enteritides of unknown etiology).
