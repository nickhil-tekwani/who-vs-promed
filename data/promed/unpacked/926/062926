Rabies outbreak alert in Isiolo
-------------------------------
An alarm has been sounded over the imminent outbreak of rabies in Isiolo
District. [Map at
<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/kenya.pdf>].
Local district veterinary officer (DVO) Dr Gerald Kimathi said his office
was overwhelmed by complaints over dog bites. Dr Kimathi said the problem
has been aggravated by the interaction of wild and domestic animals,
especially donkeys, which are the main mode of transport for the local
communities, proving to be dangerous carriers of rabies [see comment].
The DVO said there were over 2000 stray dogs currently roaming in the
entire district, including urban centers, which pose a great threat to the
residents. He said shepherds who had moved into Isiolo in search of grazing
resources during the drought period may have abandoned the dogs when they
returned. However, he said plans have been finalized to surround [a clean
term for culling?!] all the stray dogs, but the exercise was being hampered
by the heavy rains in the area. He said donkeys had never been diagnosed
with rabies, adding that it has never happened before [see comment]. He
told the residents to bring their dogs and donkeys for vaccination.

[Rabies in equids (horses, mules, donkeys) is not rare. Like man,
herbivores are dead-end victims of the infection; the vectors are
carnivores or bats. Obviously, a rabid herbivore, though not a biter, might
become a source of infection for those exposed to infected saliva.
A unique mode of rabies spread among herbivores (the kudu antelope
_Tragelaphus strepsiceros_) has been reported from Namibia (1977, 2002,
2006). These outbreaks provided an example of horizontal spread between
individuals by means of non-bite transmission. The social behavior of kudu
was believed to be the contributing factor, through the exposure of mouth
lesions from the browsing of thorn bushes to the infected saliva.
Domestic farm animals, particularly equids, in rabies-infected territories
should be vaccinated. - Mod.AS]
