Hundreds of Rare Saiga Antelopes Found Dead
-------------------------------------------
Hundreds of endangered antelopes have been found dead in western
Kazakhstan, dealing another blow to conservation efforts to save these
long-nosed creatures, Kazakhstan Today reports.

A total of 442 saigas -- a distinctive creature with a long, humped
nose that allows it to filter air during the dusty summer months and
breathe warm air during the freezing winters -- have been found dead,
West Kazakhstan Region Governor Baktykozha Izmukhambetov told a
cabinet meeting on 31 May 2011.

He said the deaths of 360 does and 82 calves may have been caused by
an outbreak of pasteurellosis, a disease that attacks the lungs and
which killed nearly 12 000 saigas in an epidemic last year. Scientists
are also investigating whether "some sort of poisoning from the flora,
which is to say from the grass, is taking place," the governor added
[see item 2, below].

The saiga, which roams in remote areas of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan,
Turkmenistan, Mongolia and Russia, is listed as Critically Endangered
on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List.

The World Wildlife Fund identifies loss of habitat and poaching as
threats to its existence: The horn of the male saiga is prized in
Chinese medicine for use as a painkiller and antibiotic, creating a
thriving and illegal trade.

Kazakhstan has the largest numbers of saigas in the world, but a
population which numbered over a million in the 1970s has been
decimated, and last year officials estimated it at 85 000.

The Altyn Dala Conservation Initiative, a partnership between the
Association for the Conservation of Biodiversity of Kazakhstan, the
UK's Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the Frankfurt
Zoological Society, says that more than 5.2 million hectares of land
has already been legally protected in Kazakhstan to provide safe areas
for the animals to roam.

Saiga antelopes in west Kazakhstan. Several possible etiological
agents, infectious and non-infectious, were raised and discussed,
including plant-based intoxication. At a later stage, an expert

Examination of the forage basis of Saiga in the Ural population on
the background of the mass death in May 2010
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By: Til Dieterich (Freelance, ACBK (Association for the Conservation
of Biodiversity in Kazakhstan), <til.dieterich@web.de>); Bibigul
Sarsenova (Uralsk agricultural-technical University,
<sarsenovab@mail.ru>) and Julia Koslenko (Petropavlosk University)

Final Report - Summary
----------------------
Mass death of Saiga antelopes took place from 18 to 21 May 2010 in
the north west of West Kazakhstan province north-east and south-east
of Borsy (about 12 000 dead animals found). In August and September
[2010] the forage basis of Saiga antelope in the mass death area was
investigated. Mass growth of poisonous Brassicacea species for
ruminants could be found on abandoned fields in the area (_Lepidium
perfoliatum_, _Lepidium ruderale_, _Descurainia sophia_ and _Thlaspi
arvense_). Due to favourable warm and wet weather conditions in spring
2010 the mass growth of these annual Brassicacea species occurred on a
big scale. All above named Brassicacea species could be found in
quantities, which are capable to kill large amounts of ruminants with
its content of toxins (mustard oil etc.).

In addition lush growth of Brassicacea and Poacea species (_Poa
bulbosa_, _Eremophyrum triticeum_, _Leymus ramosus_) providing high
protein forage, can also cause the observed symptoms of foamy
fermentation and diarrhoea. _Poa bulbosa_ and _Eremophyrum triticeum_
are ephemeral grasses, which profited also from wet and warm weather
conditions. They also showed mass growth in spring 2010. Qualitative
investigation of the dried stomach content gathered in the field
confirmed that the animals ate the Lepidium species prior to their
death.

The clinically confirmed pasteurellosis, diarrhea and foamy
fermentation are only symptoms, but not the cause of the mass death.
Due to the investigations and analysis of secondary data the following
stress factors are likely to play a role to cause the clinically
confirmed symptoms, which led consequently to the mass death of Saiga
antelope in the Ural population:

1) Calving time: i.e., high density of animals on one spot and
general physical stress due to calving (birth, feeding of calves) and
easy spreading of disease.

2) High chlorine (salt) content in plants and soil.

3) High density of annual plants from the Brassicacea family, namely
_Descurainia sophia_, _Lepidium perfoliatum_, _Lepidium ruderalis_ and
_Thlaspi arvense_ especially on abandoned fields.

4) High density of fresh, highly nutritious grasses such as _Poa
bulbosa_, _Leymus ramosus_ and _Eremophyrum triticeum_ on abandoned
fields.

5) High temperatures in the 2 weeks before the incident with 5
degrees above the monthly average for the month May and maximum
temperatures of over 30 deg C [86 deg F] during the day just at the
beginning of the incident.

The results of the investigation suggest that a combination of at
least some of the above listed factors are responsible for the tragic
event.

[In the chapter 'Data collection - Methods and Quantity,' the above
report provides the following information on the activities of the
3-member investigation team:

Two field trips, from 30 Jul to 02 Aug 2010, and from 09-13 Sep 2010,
were conducted by ACBK (Association for the Conservation of
Biodiversity in Kazakhstan) with the participation of Til Dieterich
(freelance, ACBK) and Bibigul Sarsenova (lecturer Uralsk
agricultural-technical University) as well as Julia Koslenko (biology
student, Petropavlovsk University).

The 1st field trip served as a broad screening on possible poisonous
plants or other conditions in connection with the forage basis which
might have had a negative effect on Saiga. The 2nd field trip was used
for the investigation of and search for poisonous _Lepidium_ species,
which were found in the stomachs of the perished animals. The team put
one north-south transect trough the 2 main mass death areas and
investigated abandoned fields adjacent to the site.

ProMED-mail covered the event in 4 postings, raising the possible
involvement of infectious diseases, in addition to pasteurellosis and
the non-infectious etiologies. In particular, the potential role of
FMD and PPR were discussed; there is documented evidence of past mass
mortality in Saiga antelopes in Kazakhstan due to FMD (see
commentaries in ProMED archives 20100522.1702, 20100524.1726.

The possibility that FMD is involved in the current (2011) die-off
affecting the Saiga antelope population in west Kazakhstan, should be
considered. On 27 May 2011, the authorities notified the OIE on FMD
diagnosed in cattle in west Kazakhstan (serotyping still pending). -
