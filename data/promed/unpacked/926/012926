Another case of Japanese encephalitis, a mosquito-borne viral disease, has emerged in the city [Pune], just weeks after health authorities confirmed the 1st case of the infection. A 21-year-old student from Hadapsar tested positive for the disease at the Pune-based National Institute of Virology (NIV) on 12 Dec [2016].

The 2 cases within days have put health authorities on their toes, leading them to increase surveillance in the patients' neighborhoods. TOI [Times of India] reported the 1st case of JE [Japanese encephalitis] in the city on 10 Dec [2016] after an 18-year-old agriculture science student in the city, originally from Satara, was diagnosed with the infection at NIV on 30 Nov [2016]. His condition was initially critical, and he is currently undergoing treatment at Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital (DMH).

This is the 1st time in Pune and western Maharashtra that cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) have been detected, as the disease is usually seen in the state's eastern districts.

Experts say the spread of the disease is a cause for concern as it indicates the virus is circulating in a wider geographical area.

"The infected person is a student who stays in Kalepadal in Hadapsar. His blood sample, sent to NIV, tested positive for JE on 12 Dec [2016]," a doctor from Sassoon hospital, where the patient underwent treatment, said.

"We have directed health officials to conduct entomological surveillance in the areas where both the patients stayed to curb the spread of the vector. Besides, we have also directed health officials to conduct fever surveillance in these areas and send blood samples of suspected patients to NIV for testing," joint director (vector-borne diseases) of the state health department Kanchan Jagtap said.

When contacted, state surveillance officer Pradeep Awate of the state health department said: "Such cases were never seen in Pune earlier. Barring a lone outbreak recorded in Sangli district's village Budhgaon in 1999, the JE virus was never reported in western Maharashtra." Awate added that it was important to find out the epidemiological linkage of both the Japanese encephalitis cases recorded in the city. "An entomological study is warranted to see if the virus has undergone any change in its genetic makeup or if there is any change in the vector mosquito itself," Awate said.

The _Culex_ type of mosquito, which feeds on animal blood, especially pigs, is the main vector [amplifying host] of the disease in Maharashtra. "Prevention and containment are key, as there is no specific drug, and treatment of JE is symptomatic. People should keep their surroundings clean. Besides, those living in proximity of animals or piggeries should take extra precautions. Larvicides must be used periodically in ponds with vegetation as they provide a conducive atmosphere for the vector to breed and propagate. Regular cutting of water hyacinth is also very important," Awate said.

A health official from the Pune Municipal Corporation said the civic body has taken up fogging as well as spraying of insecticide and larvicide around the patients' neighborhoods. "We are also cutting hyacinth regularly," the official added.

[Detection of JE cases in a new locality, such as Pune, raises epidemiologically important questions. Pigs may certainly serve as amplifying hosts, but the reservoir species are avian species, including ardeid birds (such as herons and egrets), which may have been the species responsible for movement of the virus into the area. The current situation in Pune presents an opportunity to take a "one health" approach and examine whether subclinical human cases are occurring and determine the role of both birds and pigs in transmission, maintenance, and movement of the virus in the area. Meanwhile, mosquito vector control efforts are prudent, and vector surveillance over several weeks will be necessary to quantify the effectiveness of the measures applied.
