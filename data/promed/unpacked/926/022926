The number of measles cases in Georgia is incasing. 142 of 403 cases have been hospitalized, according to the National Centre for Disease Control of Public Health Department of the Republic. Compared with statistics from previous years, in 2013 Georgia recorded a significant increase in prevalence of measles. A representative of the National Centre for Disease Control and Public Health, Amiran Gamkrelidze, said that measles immunization will be available without charge for all children and individuals under the age of 30.

According to Georgia Online, measles in Georgia has infected 162 persons aged 20 to 29 years of age. Currently, 96 are older than 30 years of age, 37 are adolescents (15 to 19 years), 22 are teenagers (10-14 years), 17 are children (aged 5 to 9 years) and 47 are infants aged from one to 4 years. In addition, measles was diagnosed in 22 babies.

According to the Dagestan RIA news agency, the measles epidemic in Dagestan continues undiminished. So far in 2013, a total of 19 laboratory confirmed cases of measles have been recorded in 7 administrative zones. Four of these cases were children under 17 years of age (21.1 percent); 3 were children under one year of age (17.6 percent).

Most of the cases were recorded in the in Tabasaransky and Derbent regions, which accounted for 68 percent of the reported cases in the country. The composition of the cases during the 2013 outbreak by age group is as follows: 70.25 percent (12 persons) aged 20 to 29, 17.6 percent (3 children) under one year of age, while 64 percent of those affected were not employed.

The authorities have responded to the outbreak by extending vaccination to all those with no prior history of vaccination.

Measles is a particular danger for children under one year who by virtue of their age have not yet been vaccinated. Susceptible adults are at risk of suffering more severe disease and the likelihood of complications.

Measles is an acute infectious viral disease characterised by general intoxication, fever, lesions of the mucous membranes of the eyes and respiratory system and is accompanied by a rash. Measles virus is transmitted from the patient via droplets through sneezing, coughing, talking, and even breathing.

Nearly 100 percent of unvaccinated people are sensitive to infection. Measles can be contracted by an unvaccinated person, even by entering a room where an infected person had been present a few hours previously. Measles is contagious 1-2 days before the 1st signs of illness appear and ceases to be contagious 5 days after the rash disappears. There is no specific treatment for measles. Therefore, it is essential to prevent its appearance by means of vaccination, employing the generally available live attenuated measles vaccine (included in the MMR triple vaccine).

Another 17 confirmed and 4 suspected cases of measles have been reported in the North-East in the last week. The latest figures for the on-going measles outbreak in the region have been reported by the Health Protection Agency (HPA). Since the beginning of September 2012, when the numbers started increasing, 181 confirmed cases and 162 suspected cases of the illness have now been reported. The majority of cases continue to be reported from the Teesside, County Durham and Darlington areas. People aged between 10 and 19 years continue to be most affected, making up 41 per cent of all cases.

Julia Waller, HPA immunisation lead in the North-East, said: "There is no treatment for measles, but it can be prevented by the MMR vaccine, and 2 doses are required to ensure the best protection. If anyone is unsure about their immunisation status, they should check with their GP."

Health chiefs are urging people to get protected against measles as the North-East outbreak continues. Since the beginning of September 2012, when the numbers started increasing, 181 confirmed cases and 162 suspected cases of the illness have now been reported across the region, an increase of 17 confirmed and 4 suspected cases on the previous week.

In Hartlepool, there have been 2 confirmed cases, and in County Durham, which includes Peterlee and East Durham, there have been 18. The majority of cases have been reported in the Tees area, and people aged between 10 and 19 years continue to be most affected, making up 41 per cent of all cases. Julia Waller, immunisation lead for the Health Protection Agency in the North-East, said: "Measles is highly infectious, and unvaccinated children and adults who haven't had it before are at risk when it is circulating, as it is now in this region. There is no treatment for measles, but it can be prevented by the MMR vaccine, and 2 doses are required to ensure the best protection. If anyone is unsure about their immunisation status, they should check with their GP. If you've missed out on MMR in the past, it's always possible to catch-up as the vaccine can be given at any age."

Health officials have long feared that vaccine skepticism will push down immunization rates and threaten herd immunity. Lack of trust in vaccines was blamed, in part, for the resurgence of polio in Nigeria. Now it seems to be causing problems in the UK too. Health officials in Wales are bemoaning the slow uptake of vaccines as a measles outbreak threatens to sweep across the country. Cases have, so far, been restricted largely to the city of Swansea. But with the Easter break coming up, healthcare authorities worry it will spread as kids travel to other parts of the United Kingdom to see family. The number of cases in Swansea has more than doubled to 432 in the past 3 weeks, resulting in 51 hospitalisations.

By the end of April 2013, health officials fear the number of cases will top 1000. The last comparable outbreak occurred in Dublin, Ireland in 1999, when there were 1200 cases and 3 deaths. In an attempt to stop the Swansea outbreak reaching those levels, health officials have been vocal in local and national media. Despite the communication blitz, vaccination rates have disappointed. Just 100 of the 3800 susceptible kids aged 2 and over in the Swansea area had the vaccine last week.

The reason so few are getting vaccinated is unclear, but health concerns are likely to play a role. Vaccination rates for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) tumbled in the early 2000s in the wake of the autism scare. In fiscal 2011, 87 percent of children in Wales had received both doses of MMR by the time they turned 5 years old. United Kingdom health officials think a 95 percent vaccination rate is needed to stop the spread of measles. Some parents now regret the decision not to vaccinate. "We feel so guilty; we took the decision for her not to have it. We just wish she had had the injection," said one father, whose daughter has measles, reported the South Wales Evening Post.

Over 6000 cases of measles were reported in 4 months in different parts of Punjab, mostly in Lahore, during the current surveillance drive, stated Director Health Services for EPI Punjab, Dr Tanveer Ahmed. 60-70 cases of measles are being reported every day in different parts of the province, he added. He stated further that 19 deaths of children had been reported so far including in Gujranwala, Rajanpur, Rahim Yar Khan, Kasur and Lahore district.

"The vaccination and surveillance drive has been stepped up to control the threat. It is also part of the strategy to mop up and vaccinate areas with measles patients," said the director. He said that intensive vaccination was also launched in Rahim Yar Khan and adjoining tehsils [an administrative division - CopyEd.MSP] near the Sindh border so that the virus will be prevented from spreading into Punjab. Dr Ahmed said that measles vaccination was available at all hospitals in Lahore and that parents should get their children, up to the age of 5, vaccinated without delay.

On Thu 28 Mar 2013, Health Department officials have reported a confirmed case of measles in South Florida. The Florida Department of Health in Broward County reported that a 41-year-old woman had contracted the disease outside the United States. The department has notified facilities the patient may have visited, individuals who may have been exposed and Broward health care providers. Officials said the patient is doing well.

Measles is very rare in countries that are able to keep vaccination coverage high, but it is considered highly contagious. Measles virus spreads through the air by breathing, coughing or sneezing and can be transmitted from 4 days before the rash becomes visible to 4 days after it appears. Symptoms generally start showing up one to 2 weeks after a person is exposed to the virus and include a blotchy rash, fever, coughing, body aches and tiny white spots inside the mouth.

Anyone who has these symptoms should contact their health care provider. For more information, visit http://www.cdc.gov/measles/index.html.

State health officials have confirmed a case of measles in a student at Indiana University [IU] Bloomington. This student did not attend classes while infectious and does not live on campus. The Indiana State Department of Health, the Monroe County Health Department and Indiana University are working to identify potential additional cases and to prevent further transmission of the disease. The individual visited the IU Health Bloomington Hospital emergency department and a CVS pharmacy while infectious on 24 Mar 2013. IU Health Bloomington Hospital is contacting individuals directly who may have been exposed to measles.

Visitors to the CVS Pharmacy at 1000 N. College Ave, Bloomington, IN, 47404, from 4:30-7:30 p.m. on 24 Mar 2013 may have been exposed to the measles virus. Individuals who cannot verify 2 doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine or who were born in 1957 or later should contact their health care provider. In addition, individuals who develop symptoms of measles should stay home and call their health care provider as well as the Monroe County Health Department at (812) 349-2543.

On 25 Mar 2013, the individual visited the IU Student Health Center at 600 N. Jordan Ave., Bloomington, IN, 47405 while infectious. Risk of exposure at this location is very low because the individual wore a mask during the time spent in the clinic. A very small number of patients may have been exposed. The Student Health Center is contacting these individuals directly.

Measles is rare in the United States due to the widespread availability of the MMR vaccine; however, visitors from other countries or U.S. citizens traveling abroad can become infected before or during travel. More than 95 percent of people who receive a single dose of MMR will develop immunity to measles, and more than 99 percent will be protected after receiving a 2nd dose. Children are routinely vaccinated for measles at one year of age, and again at 4-6 years of age before going to kindergarten, but children as young as 6 months old can receive the measles vaccine if they are at risk. Individuals born before 1957 are presumed to be immune to measles. Individuals who are unsure about vaccination history should contact their health care providers. The Indiana public can also access immunization records directly through the secure online tool MyVaxIndiana by requesting a PIN from their health care provider. Go to http://www.MyVaxIndiana.in.gov to learn more.

Before licensure of a measles vaccine in 1963, more than 500 000 measles cases on average were reported in the United States each year during 1951 to 1962. By 1993, through measles vaccination and control efforts, only 312 cases were reported nationwide. In 2000, the last year in which an outbreak had occurred in Utah, measles was declared "not endemic in the United States," but measles importations continue to occur, leading to outbreaks, especially among unvaccinated persons.

Many U.S. health-care personnel have never seen a measles patient, which might hamper diagnosis and delay reporting. During March-June 2011, local health departments collaborated with the state health department in Utah to investigate 2 measles outbreaks comprising 13 confirmed cases. The 1st outbreak, with 7 confirmed cases, was associated with an unvaccinated U.S. resident who traveled internationally; the 2nd, with 6 confirmed cases, had an undetermined source. The genotype D4 sequences obtained from these 2 outbreaks differed by a single nucleotide, suggesting 2 separate importations.

Health-care providers should remind their patients of the importance of being current with measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination; this is especially important before international travel. Measles should be considered in the differential diagnosis of febrile rash illness, especially in unvaccinated persons with recent international travel. Reporting a confirmed or suspected case immediately to public health authorities is critical to limit the spread of measles.

Outbreak 1. On 5 Apr 2011, a health-care provider notified the Salt Lake Valley Health Department (SLVHD) of an unvaccinated Salt Lake County resident aged 16 years with generalized rash (onset 4 Apr 2011) and a 3-day history of sore throat and fever (101.7 F [38.7 C]) (Table). When investigated by public health officials on 6 Apr 2011, the patient had a morbilliform rash, cough, coryza, conjunctivitis, and Koplik spots, and reported no recent travel or contact with ill persons. Serum collected on 5 Apr 2011 was positive for measles immunoglobulin M (IgM). On 7 Apr 2011, SLVHD announced that a measles case had been confirmed.

On 8 Apr 2011, a health-care provider notified SLVHD that an unvaccinated Salt Lake County patient aged 15 years had sought care in late March 2011 with generalized rash (onset 21 Mar 2011), fever (103.7 F [39.8 C]), cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis. The patient had traveled in Europe during 3-17 Mar 2011. No measles testing was performed during the acute illness. Serum collected on 8 Apr 2011 was measles IgM-positive. This patient had attended a school class on 21 Mar 2011 with the patient reported previously. Five additional Salt Lake County residents were confirmed to have measles, with the last rash onset on 17 Apr 2011 (Figure).

Outbreak 2. On 24 May 2011, a Cache County resident notified the Bear River Health Department that her unvaccinated child aged 7 years had signs and symptoms compatible with measles, including generalized rash (onset 23 May 2011) and fever (101.5 F [38.6 C]) (Table, Figure). She reported no recent travel outside Utah or contact with any person with a rash illness; the source was not identified. Serum collected on 26 May 2011 was measles IgM-positive. On 31 May 2011, the Bear River Health Department announced that a measles case had been identified. Two unvaccinated siblings of the patient, for whom the parents declined postexposure vaccination, were home-quarantined and developed measles, with rash onsets on 1 and 2 Jun 2011, respectively. Additionally, 2 Cache County residents and one Millard County resident, all family members of the 2 siblings, were identified as having measles; the last reported rash onset was 16 Jun 2011.

In the 2 outbreaks, separated by 36 days, 13 persons were confirmed to have measles; 9 (69 percent) were unvaccinated and had personal belief exemptions, one had a documented history of 2 doses of measles antigen-containing vaccine, and 3 adult patients reported a history of vaccination, although vaccination records were not available. Patients were aged 5 to 48 years.

Measles genotype D4 was identified from the clinical samples obtained in both outbreaks. Two unvaccinated patients were hospitalized, one for 3 days for respiratory complications and another overnight in an emergency department for observation.

Among the 12 cases where the source of infection was known, measles infections were acquired during international travel (one case) and in households (8) and schools (3). During the Salt Lake County outbreak, 7 additional patients who initially tested positive or equivocal by commercial measles IgM testing were suspected of having measles but were not confirmed at CDC. Five of these had a history of vaccination, no direct epidemiologic link to the Salt Lake County cases, and were confirmed as parvovirus B19 cases by additional serologic testing. The 6th patient suspected of having measles was epidemiologically linked to the school, and the 7th was a household contact of that patient; neither showed evidence of measles infection in samples tested by CDC.

For both outbreaks, approximately 13 000 contacts of patients were notified by visit, phone, letter, or e-mail. Health officials reviewed vaccination records of approximately 8700 exposed persons, conducted 253 measles IgG antibody tests, and administered 484 MMR vaccine and 28 measles immunoglobulin doses as postexposure prophylaxis. Voluntary home quarantine of 192 exposed persons without presumptive evidence of immunity was requested.

MMWR Editorial Note:
-----------------
Because measles remains endemic in many regions of the world, the United States continues to be at risk for measles importations and outbreaks. In 2011, a total of 220 measles cases were reported in the United States, the highest number of reported measles cases since 1996; 89 percent were associated with importations (2). The outbreaks in Utah and elsewhere during 2011 highlight the critical need for appropriate vaccination of U.S. residents, particularly those who travel internationally. The Salt Lake County outbreak began when an unvaccinated traveler from the United States developed measles on returning to the United States and infected 4 other unvaccinated persons.

The genotype D4 sequences obtained from the 2 Utah outbreaks differed by a single nucleotide. Each of the Utah sequences was identical to one of 2 predominant sequence variants of genotype D4 that were circulating in Europe during 2011. This, together with the interval of 5 weeks without cases between the 2 outbreaks, suggests the 2nd outbreak likely was the result of a separate importation from an unknown source rather than a continuation of the 1st outbreak.

In the Salt Lake County outbreak, 3 of the patients were adolescents who acquired the disease in school. In 2010, an estimated 96.4 percent of children attending public school in Utah were vaccinated with 2 doses of MMR vaccine. The high level of vaccination coverage among schoolchildren likely helped contain this outbreak. None of the 3 patients infected by the index patient at school transmitted the disease to other students. Ensuring high vaccination rates among schoolchildren is important to limit measles transmission.
