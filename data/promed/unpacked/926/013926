A total of 172 cholera cases have been found since Aug 2005 in East China's
Fujian Province, the highest number in recent years. So far, there have
been no deaths since the 1st case was found on 12 Aug 2005 in Fuzhou,
capital of the province.
The reported 172 cases include 137 in Fuzhou, and sporadic ones in a few
other coastal areas, according to statistics from the Health Department of
the Fujian provincial government. Up to now, 83 patients have recovered and
been released from hospital. All other patients are in stable condition.
The incidence of the disease is higher than the same period in recent
years, said health officials.
Most patients said that they had eaten seafood in some small roadside
restaurants. An initial investigation by the province's health and epidemic
prevention departments agreed that the outbreak was caused by seafood,
especially shellfish. The departments have been inspecting more than 100
kinds of seafood in the province in order to confirm the cause of the
disease. To stop the disease spreading further, quarantine and inspection
stations have been requested to enhance sanitation supervision for seafood
in the markets and shut down restaurants without business licenses.

The Centre for Health Protection has confirmed a case of cholera involving
a 75 year old woman, bringing the number of cases in 2005 to 5.
The patient travelled to Guangzhou on 7 Sep 2005 and returned to Hong Kong
on 11 Sep. She developed symptoms of diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting on 12
Sep and was admitted to Queen Mary Hospital in stable condition. Laboratory
tests confirmed she had contracted _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 Ogawa.
The Centre for Health Protection reminds the public to observe good
personal, food and environmental hygiene at all times -- whether in Hong
Kong or traveling abroad -- to prevent cholera and food-borne infections.
Cholera is endemic in the Asia-Pacific region and usually occurs during
summer months. Occasional outbreaks are also found.
According to the Ministry of Health, more cholera cases have been reported
on the Mainland so far in 2005 than during the same period in 2004.

[4] Cholera, single dose antimicrobial therapy - Bangladesh

A single dose of an antibiotic is an effective treatment for children with
cholera, an infection that strikes more than 110 000 people each year,
scientists in Bangladesh said in a report published on Thu, 15 Sep 2005.
The WHO recommends a 3-day, 12-dose course of the drugs tetracycline or
erythromycin for children suffering from cholera. But researchers at the
Centre for Health and Population Research in Dhaka found that a single dose
of ciprofloxacin works just as well.
"For infections caused by susceptible strains of _V. cholerae_, single-dose
ciprofloxacin achieves clinical outcomes similar to or better than those
achieved with 12-dose erythromycin treatment in childhood cholera," Dr
Debasish Saha, who headed the study, said in a report published online by
The Lancet medical journal.
The researchers compared the standard treatment with erythromycin and a
single dose of ciprofloxacin in 162 children. They found the single dose
worked within 48 hours in 60 per cent of cases, compared with 55 per cent
in the other group. Ciprofloxacin was more effective in reducing vomiting
but was not as good as the standard treatment at eradicating the bacteria.
The researchers said the single-dose drug should be considered an option
for 1st-line treatment for childhood cholera.

[This interesting report (Saha D, Khan W, Karim MM, et al: Single-dose
ciprofloxacin versus 12-dose erythromycin for childhood cholera:a
randomised controlled trial. Lancet 2005 (in press) is based on data
collected between May 2001 and Jun 2002. A corresponding editorial (Deen
JI, Clemens JD: Antimcrobial treatment for cholera. Lancet 2005 (in press)
makes the following comments:
"Although these findings are potentially important, there may be reasons to
pause before considering them definitive. The study is weakened because it
was not double-blinded. Awareness of the assigned study agent could have
affected the ascertainment of outcomes, especially as the primary outcome
(resolution of watery stools within 48 h without recurrence in the next 3
days), as well as several secondary outcomes, were subjectively assessed.
The persuasiveness of this study may also be diminished by the comparison
of single-dose ciprofloxacin only with multidose erythromycin. Previously,
The Lancet published a trial by the same research group in Bangladesh,
showing that single-dose azithromycin was equivalent to standard
erythromycin therapy in rates of clinical cures and bacteriological
successes when used for severely dehydrating childhood cholera, and was
also associated with a lower frequency of vomiting. By contrast with the
study in today's Lancet, the previous trial was double-blinded. These
previous findings cause substantial ambiguity about whether ciprofloxacin,
azithromycin, or both should be recommended as a single-dose alternative to
conventional multidose therapy with erythromycin. The clinical pertinence
of the present trial's findings would have been enhanced if single-dose
azithromycin had been included as a compared regimen. A trial comparing
single-dose regimens of these 2 antibiotics would be important to consider
for the future."

Abdoulie Camara, a senior official at the Disease Surveillance Unit at the
department of state for Health, has warned the Gambian populace to give
extra attention to their personal hygiene to avoid getting [cholera infection].
5 patients have so far been admitted at the RVTH (Royal Victoria Teaching
Hospital) on suspicion of contracting cholera, shortly after 1 death was
reported on Mon, 19 Sep 2005, in Brikama.
Reacting to the news, Mr Camara said: "People should take an extra look at
their personal hygiene, feedings and water, and scale down their attendance
at ceremonies. They should also wash their bodies thoroughly to avoid
contraction. The entirety of West Africa is affected. And people should
avoid travelling to areas where the disease is prevalent. Many deaths have
occurred," he warned.
Mr Camara confirmed that the suspected cases and death were caused by
cholera which was contained a few months ago. He said the investigations of
the 5 suspected cases revealed that they contracted the disease while
washing the body of a person who died of cholera. He said the 5 patients
have been admitted at an isolated ward at the RVTH. "No one is allowed
access to them."
2 samples have been sent to the RVTH lab for testing. "They are being
attended by doctors and nurses at the hospital, and they are responding to
treatment,"he added.

A cholera epidemic has killed 46 people in southwestern Niger since Jul
2005, according to figures quoted by state radio. The announcement followed
a visit by health minister Ari Ibrahim to the Tahoua region, where 383
cases of the highly infectious disease were recorded, the report said. The
death toll is more than twice previous figures from a national health data
agency stating that 22 people had died out of 251 reported cholera cases in
3 southwestern health districts.
Without giving a breakdown of district figures, the radio report said the
health minister's tour was to bolster efforts to contain the outbreak.
"Most of the patients have been treated and have returned home," it added.

Senegal's months-long cholera epidemic has flared up once again following
severe flooding this month in the suburbs of the capital Dakar, according
to statistics from the Health Ministry on Mon, 19 Sep 2005.
The West African nation has registered a total 23 325 cases of cholera and
321 deaths in the last 9 months, the ministry said, but the number of cases
increased steeply this month, with 1031 cases from 5-11 Sep and 1110 from
12-18 Sep 2005. There were 25 deaths the 1st week of September and 21 the
next from the waterborne disease, which can kill within a day by inducing
severe vomiting and diarrhea.
"The floods have triggered an explosion in the number of cases," said Papa
Salif Sow, who heads the infectious diseases ward at Dakar's Fann hospital.
From an average 5 cases a day through Jun, Jul and Aug 2005, "since the
floods we've been seeing 45 cases of cholera per day," he told IRIN.
The Senegalese capital has been devastated by the heaviest rains seen in 2
decades, with 5600 people displaced by floods and thousands still living
with water around their ankles several weeks after the storms.
The disaster has centered on Dakar's impoverished outer suburbs, where a
lack of street drains and sewage, coupled with a breakdown in refuse
collection due to the floods, has spawned disease.
The outbreak of cholera late in 2004 in the once tidy city unnerved the
cash-strapped health authorities, who had been last faced by an epidemic in
1996.

[8] Cholera - Senegal (Dakar)

The "unwashed hands" disease continues to ravage the country. The Dakar
region, with its flooding, is uppermost among those affected areas, with 54
per cent of the cases and 60 per cent of the deaths in the country. This
increase in cholera cases was the reason for holding an interministerial
counsel on this disease at the office of the prime minister.
The interministerial counsel, dedicated to cholera and held yesterday, 15
Sep 2005, at the prime minister's office, discussed at length the urgent
measures to take in view of the recurrence of the epidemic. The "unwashed
hands" disease encompassed more area in the flooded zones as well as in
Dakar, which makes up most of these areas. With a national average of 146
cases per day during the week of 5- 11 Sep 2005, the Dakar region reported
54 per cent of the cases in the country and 60 per cent of the deaths
during that same period.
"The stagnation of rainwater, associated with poor living conditions, along
with the insufficiency of water decontamination and production facilities,
the people's attitude toward risks in hygiene matters, and the
proliferation of disease vectors, exposes the population, particularly
those in flooded areas, to a major epidemic, particularly in this context
of this permissiveness," stated the health minister in his communication to
the interministerial counsel. Before the assessment at the time of the 1st
week after the flooding (22-28 Aug 2005), there was a tendency towards an
increase, compared to the national average of 87 cases per day, as well as
more the 1 death per day on average. The second week after the flooding (29
Aug-4 Sep 2005, the trend continued with an average of 101 cases per day,
and more than the average of 1 cholera related death per day. Dakar, at
this time, becomes the region most affected with 46 per cent of the cases
in the country and 70 per cent of deaths."
This information received by the Health and Preventive Medicine minister
reveals that the flood-affected Dakar region leads, followed by Thies, with
31 per cent of the cases in the country and an average of 1 death per day.
According to the Ministry of Health and Preventive Medicine, the cholera
cases were more severe in those flooded zones, with all Dakar regions
affected, notably those of Mbao, Pikine, [and] Gudiawaye, which is the most
severely hit.
The latest epidemiological report included 174 new cholera cases and 4
deaths. The greatest increase concerns the Dakar region, with 113 new cases
and 2 deaths reported by the health authorities, who also describe 27 new
cases and 1 death in Thies. The other regions affected are Diourbel with 15
new cases and 1 death, Fatick (10 cases), Saint-Louis (5 cases), Kaolack (3
cases) and Louga (2 cases), according to the same source.

[9] Cholera - Guinea-Bissau

A cholera epidemic in Guinea-Bissau is showing no sign of fading, with all
regions of the impoverished country now affected and more than 4 000 new
cases of the disease reported so far in Sep 2005, officials said.
In a bulletin issued late Tue, 20 Sep 2005, the health ministry said 15 573
cases of cholera had now been recorded, up from 11 192 at the beginning of
the Sep 2005. Some 270 people have died since the epidemic first struck the
former Portuguese colony in mid-Jun 2005.
"The problem in Guinea-Bissau is that it's an epidemic that is moving out
from the towns and spreading to rural areas," said Claire-Lise Chaignat,
the leading cholera expert at the WHO. And heavy rains, which are not due
to subside until Oct 2005, make reaching those areas tricky.
"Getting people, sanitation and medicines out into rural areas is
difficult, because rains make the roads impassable and so the cholera can
continue attacking people," Michel Balima, the UN resident co-ordinator in
Guinea-Bissau, told IRIN.
When the outbreak started 3 months ago, more than 9 out of 10 cases were to
be found around the capital, Bissau -- a city of 300 000 built on low-lying
land on the banks of a muddy river estuary -- and the nearby coastal region
of Biombo to the west. Now these urban areas account for around 7 out of 10
cases, Chaignat said.

At least 4400 more people were diagnosed with cholera in just 2 weeks in
the West African state of Guinea Bissau, and 35 of them have died, the
health ministry said.
"The situation is way beyond the means we have to combat it," chief medical
officer Tome Vaz said as the new figures were released on Fri, 16 Sep 2005.
The ministry said that 4400 new cases had been reported between 1 and 15
Sep 2005, and 35 people had died in the same period. The figures took the
total since the outbreak began in Jun 2005 to 264 dead and 14 660 cases.
According to a report published by non-governmental organizations at the
start of the month, Guinea Bissau is the country most affected by cholera
in the West African region.

A 29 year old builder from Tadjikistan came to Moscow for work
intermittently and stayed with fellow countrymen who rented an apartment in
the Southern district of the capital. On his last visit, he could not work
at all, as he had problems with gastroenteritis.
A diagnosis of food poisoning was made and he was hospitalized in the 3rd
Infectious Hospital. When the diagnosis of cholera was made, the Tadjik was
hospitalized in the 2nd Infectious Hospital. Physicians immediately
isolated the 2 men and 2 women [with whom] the Tadjik lived in Moscow, but
they have remained healthy.
