South Korea ready to help North contain bird flu
-----------------------------------------------
South Korea is ready to help North Korea contain its bird flu outbreak,
government officials said on Monday [28 Mar 2005], and a local analyst said
the reclusive state probably could not battle the virus alone.
In an official media report on Sunday [27 Mar 2005], North Korea confirmed
an outbreak of bird flu at 2 chicken farms in the capital Pyongyang. It
said hundreds of thousands of birds had been culled in the country, which
has suffered from severe food shortages.
"We are willing to offer help if a request comes from the North," a South
Korean government official said by telephone. Seoul will also take
preventive measures to make sure the virus does not spread south of its
border with North Korea.
An official with the World Health Organization said the group had been
contacted by Pyongyang about the outbreak, and they would coordinate work
on counter-measures.
It was not clear whether the strain of virus involved was H5N1, which has
been known to jump from birds to humans. That strain has killed 49 people
since 2003. The North's state media said no humans had been infected. "We
do not know yet what strain it may be, but it could be the H5N1 strain,"
said Dr. Kumara Rai, director of communicable diseases for WHO in its
Southeast Asia region.
The WHO has an office in Pyongyang, Rai said, adding the North moved
effectively to counter SARS when it swept through Asia and other parts of
the world in 2003. He was encouraged by early reports that the North had
eradicated poultry. "This is a good sign that they are moving quickly," Rai
said by telephone from his office in India.
Kim Young-hoon, a senior fellow at the state-run Korea Rural Economic
Institute in Seoul, said the outbreak may have gotten out of hand, and the
North had gone public to get international help. "North Korea came to admit
the bird flu cases to receive international help. Based on the North's
announcement, we also suspect North Korea has reached the stage that they
could not control the disease any more," Kim said.
South Korean unification, health and agriculture ministry officials are
discussing Seoul's response. The response will probably include tightening
quarantine measures on visitors and vehicles from the South returning from
North Korea, another official said.
There are 2 main points of contact where South Koreans can head to the
North. The 1st is a joint industrial complex just north of the
demilitarized zone, and the 2nd is a mountain resort in the North operated
by a South Korean venture. South Korean businesses operate factories in the
North Korean city of Kaesong, a fledgling industrial complex 10 km (6
miles) north of the heavily militarized border, the Demilitarized Zone.
Kaesong is also less than 200 km south of Pyongyang.
South Korea's Hyundai Asan corporation runs a resort at Mount Kumgang, just
north of the border on the east coast. The resort has been visited by over
800 000 people since 1998.
North Korea's confirmation came after reports by businessmen working in the
country of a likely bird flu outbreak in the secretive state. That led
Seoul to indefinitely suspend planned imports of North Korean chicken. A
40-ton shipment scheduled to arrive on 17 Mar 2005 was to be the 1st shipment.
Japan, which had been importing small amounts of North Korean poultry, has
also suspended imports. An Agriculture Ministry official, who declined to
be named, said that North Korean poultry exports were a way for it to gain
foreign currency and help its moribund economy.
South Korea had 19 confirmed cases of the H5N1 strain between December 2003
and March 2004, but no human infections.
The 2 Koreas are technically at war, because the 1950-53 Korean War ended
in a truce and not a full peace treaty.

[Hopefully, the common health threat will breed cooperation between the 2
Koreas. Cooperation between neighboring countries-in-conflict to control
common zoonotic threats, such as rabies and Rift valley fever, has been
observed in the past in areas such as the Middle East. - Mod.AS]
