re: African horse sickness - South Africa (W. Cape) (04): not, RFI
------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a response to a request for information concerning the several
Western Cape horse deaths in the surveillance zone. There was an immediate
OIE notification after the 1st case at the end of February [2007], and
equine encephalosis [EE] was isolated from diagnostic material received.
The virus was typed as Bryanston strain, the proposed EE virus [EEV]
serotype 1. Last season there were, in fact, 4 equine deaths in different
provinces and involving other serotypes of encephalosis. Bryanston was in
circulation in the W Cape last year as it often is. The virus is widespread
and prevalent as was noted by the moderator.
There were unusually large Culicoides catches in the affected area and a
positive PCR was obtained from the midges for both bluetongue and
encephalosis but not for horsesickness virus.

[ProMED-mail's posting "African horse sickness - South Africa (W. Cape)
(04): NOT, RFI" reported about the exclusion of AHS as the causative agent
of recent equine mortalities in the Western Cape province of South Africa.
Information on the final diagnosis of the cases, particularly in relation
to EE, was requested. The authoritative information from Dr Gerdes, head of
OIE's reference laboratory for AHS in the Onderstepoort Veterinary
Institute, is gratefully acknowledged.
A useful, concise review on EE, provided by JT Paweska, T Gerdes & R
Meiswinkel, can be found in ProMED-mail's posting "Equine encephalosis - S.
Africa (Port Elizabeth)", archived as 19990428.0708.
EEV, an orbivirus transmitted by culicoides, is regarded as confined to
South Africa. The hazard of EE's possible spread to Europe has recently
been raised by EFSA experts (see in ProMED-mail's posting "Bluetongue -
Europe (07): BTV-8", archived as 20070414.1249).
Any available information on past serological investigations for EEV
elsewhere (such as in North Africa, Middle East) will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
