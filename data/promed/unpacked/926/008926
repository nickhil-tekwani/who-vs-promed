Two Exeter [Devon, England] students, with no direct link with each other, have been diagnosed with meningitis. A 2nd case has been confirmed by the University of Exeter today [9 Nov 2021] following a case that occurred in mid-October [2021].

Meningitis is a very serious illness which is potentially fatal if not treated quickly. It is an infection of the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord, known as meninges, caused by the meningococcal bacteria. This causes life-threatening blood poisoning, known as septicaemia and can result in permanent damage to the brain or nerves.

Tragedy recently struck the University in 2019 when a young man died from the illness.

In a message to students, The University of Exeter said: "To our knowledge there is no direct link between the 2 students, but we are working very closely with local public health agencies to inform us if any further public health management is required. The vast majority of meningococcal infections are sporadic and the risk of transmission to others remains very low. The UK Health Security Agency has taken action to reduce the risk of further cases and there is no reason to change your university routine or for students to stay away from University."

Meningococcal septicaemia can affect anyone but is most common in babies, young children, teenagers, and young adults. It is caused by a bacterial or viral [not viral] infection, which can be spread through sneezing, coughing, kissing, and sharing of utensils, cutlery, and toothbrushes. It is usually caught from people who carry these [bacteria] in their nose or throat but are not unwell themselves.

Exeter University offers the MenACWY [meningococcal conjugate serogroups ACWY vaccine] vaccination to 1st year students under the age of 25 for free. This protects against 4 different types of meningitis and septicaemia.

The university said they will be offering "full support" to the student in the hopes they make a full recovery. They also mentioned that the risk to other students is "very small" but "it is important that everyone is aware of the signs and symptoms of both meningitis and septicaemia at all times."

[Meningococcal meningitis is caused by bacterium _Neisseria meningitidis_, which is spread person-to-person by sharing respiratory and throat secretions at close and lengthy contact (for example, coughing or kissing). People at increased risk of meningococcal disease include household members and roommates of a patient with invasive meningococcal disease, and anyone with direct contact with the patient's oral secretions, such as a boyfriend or girlfriend. These close contacts should receive antibiotics to help prevent them from getting the disease.

The near elimination of _N. meningitidis_ serogroup C (MenC) as a consequence of the MenC conjugate vaccine program in the UK was followed by the emergence of a "replacement" pathogen, _N. meningitidis_ serogroup W (MenW). Consequently, all children are now offered the MenC conjugate vaccine combined with _Haemophilus influenzae_ B vaccine at one year of age, plus the tetravalent MenACWY conjugate vaccine at 14 years of age, and students up to the age of 25 1st going to university, to prevent MenW disease (http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/men-acwy-vaccine.aspx). _N. meningitidis_ serogroup B (MenB) vaccine is also offered to babies at 2, 4, and 12 months (https://www.meningitisnow.org/meningitis-explained/what-is-meningitis/meningitis-vaccines/).

Meningococcal serogroup B (MenB) is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in the UK. Prior to the introduction of the infant MenB vaccine in September 2015 and teenage MenACWY immunisation program, MenB accounted for 58% of meningococcal disease for all ages, followed by MenW (24%), MenY (13%), and MenC (4%); MenB accounted for 83% of cases <1-4 years of age and 50% of cases 15-24 years of age, whereas MenW accounted for 13% of cases <1-4 years of age and 29% of cases 15-24 years of age (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/498057/hpr3815_imd-crrctd.pdf).

The news article above reports that 2 Exeter university students, with no direct link with each other, have been diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis about one month apart. Antibiotics should be recommended for close contacts of the 2 cases to prevent disease. Vaccinating people identified as being at increased risk is done in the setting of an outbreak. A meningococcal disease outbreak is judged to have occurred when multiple cases of the same serogroup occur in a population over a short period of time (https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/outbreaks/index.html).

However, we have not been told the serogroup(s) causing meningococcal meningitis in the 2 students. If the 2 cases have different serogroups, we don't have an outbreak at the present time. Nor have we been told the meningococcal vaccination status for the 2 students. More information would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources on the 2 Exeter cases.

Exeter (estimated population, 131 405 residents in 2019) is a city in the county of Devon, South West England, 65 miles (105 km) south-west of the city of Bristol (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exeter). The University of Exeter is a public research university, with over 23 000 students, located mainly in the city of Exeter (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Exeter).
