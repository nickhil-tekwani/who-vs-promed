Authorities in Iceland have decided to waive the formal
home-quarantine export requirement for horses, imposed after the
widespread outbreak of an upper respiratory tract infection in equines.

The website <http://visir.is> reports that the country's Food and
Veterinary Authority (MAST) will lift the restriction on 1 Jan 2011,
provided the disease does not flare up again.

The mystery disease was named hestapest [Icelandic for "Horse
sickness"], with research indicating the outbreak was caused by a
streptococcal strain of bacteria, inflicting misery on the native
Icelandic horses. Horses suffered nasal discharge, dry coughing and
laryngitis. Some developed mild conjunctivitis.

MAST imposed the restrictions to meet export requirements to the
European Union and the United States. It will remain the
responsibility of sellers to ensure that horses to be exported have
not been in contact with horses showing symptoms of the disease for
at least a month before export.

MAST report in mid-November 2010 that the epidemic was in decline.
The 1st cases were reported at the beginning of April [2010]. "The
infection has now cleared in the majority of riding horses and
free-roaming herds," MAST reported.

Iceland's horse owners call the illness hestapest, and it has caused
its fair share of grief as it swept across the country.

Research indicates the disease is [caused] by a streptococcal strain
of bacteria, inflicting misery on the native Icelandic horses with a
respiratory tract infection.

Horses suffered nasal discharge, dry coughing and laryngitis. Some
developed mild conjunctivitis.

The 1st cases were reported in early April 2010. In the days
following, it became apparent that the disease was already widespread
and that an epidemic could not be avoided. A 4-month halt was
subsequently placed on the export of horses from Iceland, which was
due to expire on 15 Sep 2010. A significant number of Iceland's
horses caught the disease. No deaths were reported, and the symptoms
were generally mild, with horses making a full recovery. However, the
outbreak hobbled the horse industry for a time and resulted in
economic losses for commercial breeders.

Some horses throughout Iceland still exhibit symptoms, and the
infection has lingered among stallion groups and other groups,
especially where infected horses have come into contact with healthy
susceptible horses.

Experience has shown that horses that have caught the disease can
catch it again. However, the horse population is showing signs of
increased resistance to the infectious agent, and indirect infection
appears to be declining, officials said.

Animal health officials say a better understanding of the causes of
the disease and the growing resistance among horses are now serving
as valuable tools in closing infection routes and minimising the rate
of infection within certain groups.

Extensive research by respected research bodies in Iceland and abroad
suggests the bacterium _Streptococcus zooepidemicus_ is the main and
probably the only cause of the disease. The bacterium has been
cultivated from all samples from horses exhibiting coughing and
running nose with coloured mucous.

It has not been possible to link the disease to any known virus in
horses, and there are no indications that the cause of the disease is
viral or immunosuppressive in nature.

_S. zooepidemicus_ is a known infectious agent in horses worldwide,
although epidemics of this severity have not been recorded to date.
The incubation period is long, and it can take 3-4 weeks to determine
whether a horse is infected within an isolated group.

Infection caused by _S. zooepidemicus_ is not among the diseases
notifiable to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), and no
restrictions have been imposed on the export of horses from Iceland.

However, European Union states demand that the horses they receive be
free of disease and that the same applies to other horses they have
been in contact with for the preceding 30 days (60 days when
exporting to United States).

Iceland's Food and Veterinary Authority has imposed a requirement
that all horses to be exported must be kept in isolated groups on
farms, "a kind of home quarantine," for at least 30 days before
export (60 days when exporting to the US.)

Owners are responsible for the quarantine and monitoring of their
horses, and a veterinarian will assess the quarantine and health of
the horses to ensure that horses are symptom-free before export as an
extra security measure.

A declaration by the owner and veterinarian stating that the horses
are free of symptoms and that proper quarantine measures were
employed must be issued for each horse and accompany it.

Experts who pinpointed the source of the infection as _S.
zooepidemicus_ had tested for a raft of possible infections,
including Equine alfaherpesvirus type 1 and 4 (EHV-1 and 4), Equine
gammaherpesvirus 2 and 5 (EHV- 2 and 5), Equine arteritis virus
(EAV), Equine adenovirus type 1 (EadV-1), pan-influenzavirus A,
Equine influenza A, pan-Reovirus, Equine rhinitis virus A (ERAV),
Equine rhinovirus type 3 (ErhV-3), parainfluenzavirus type 3.

A recent report on <http://www.Visir.is> reports that Iceland's chief
epidemiologist, Haraldur Briem, has confirmed a case of the infection
in a person. He noted that doctors had not been routinely screening
for the disease until now.

[The horse population of Iceland (2009 figures, OIE) was 77 500. The
Icelandic human population (2009) was about 320 000. This means a
relatively high equine/human ratio. Icelandic horses have been bred
only with local horses since the Middle Ages. Iceland, a remote and
isolated island/state, maintains in-bred animal populations (mainly
sheep and horses), which are particularly susceptible to exotic
disease agents. In sheep, this has led several times in the past to
stormy epizootics caused by introduced disease agents which had been
known, elsewhere, to be slow and limited in spread (e.g.
paratuberculosis, maedi-visna, adenomatosis and scrapie).

The low prevalence of disease in Iceland's horses is maintained by
laws preventing horses exported from the country being returned, and
by requiring that all equine equipment taken into the country be
either new and unused or fully disinfected. As a result, native
horses have no acquired immunity to disease. This may explain the
unusual impact of the described introduction of _S. zooepidemicus_
(_Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus_), a bacterium not
regarded to have significant impact on international trade, being one
of the most common bacteria isolated from respiratory infections in
horses worldwide.

_Streptococcus zooepidemicus_ is associated with a number of
opportunistic infections of horses including respiratory disease,
keratitis, and abortion. It is, however, as its name suggests, a
potentially zoonotic pathogen capable of infecting many mammalian
species, including dogs and humans. There have been a number of
documented cases of it being the aetiological agent of acute fatal
haemorrhagic pneumonia in dogs and serious though rare disease in
humans (nephritis, septicemia, meningitis); see 20091209.4191.

_S. zooepidemicus_ tends to be susceptible to numerous antibiotics,
including penicillin and trimethoprim-sulfa. Since some strains can
be resistant to various drugs, sensitivity tests are prescribed.

The Icelandic veterinary authorities and scientists are to be
commended for the efficient control of the outbreak, including its
international trade ramifications.
