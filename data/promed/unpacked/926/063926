--------------------------------------------------------------------
In comparing brucellosis rates in Italy to those of neighboring countries,
the moderator suggested that data should also be expanded to include Spain,
Portugal, Greece, and Cyprus.

Rates for the latter are contrasted on the graph at

[The added data from the 4 southern European countries known to be infected
by _Brucella melitensis_, kindly provided by Professor Berger, are more
meaningful than data previously provided from Switzerland, Austria, and
Slovenia. As indicated in posting 20080121.0258, Italy's human brucellosis
situation has improved since 1996, when the incidence was 3.3 per 100 000,
becoming 0.5/100 000 in 2004, followed by a very slight increase. The data
from the other infected countries, according to the Gideon graph presented
above, are as follows:

Portugal: about 9 recorded human brucellosis cases per 100 000 during 1996,
down to about 1/100 000 in 2006.
Spain: about 4 recorded human brucellosis cases per 100 000 during 1996,
down to about 1/100 000 in 2006.
Greece: about 3 recorded human brucellosis cases per 100 000 during 1996;
the same incidence still recorded in 2006.
Cyprus had no cases during the period 1996-2001, while a few cases (less
than 1/100 000) were recorded during 2002-2003, and back to (almost) none
since 2004.

Efforts to eradicate _B. melitensis_ from the European countries affected
(Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, and Greece) have been under way -- with EU
support -- for years; though advances are significant (Greece excluded),
total eradication has not been achieved so far.

_B. melitensis_ is maintained mainly within small ruminants (sheep and
goats), though cases in cattle and buffaloes may occur sporadically. _B.
abortus_ is maintained mainly within large bovines (cattle and buffaloes).
