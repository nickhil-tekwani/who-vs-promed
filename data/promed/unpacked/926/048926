[CCHF virus has been observed in over 30 countries, including in Africa (Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa, Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda, Tanzania, Mauritania, Kenya), Asia (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, China), the Middle East (Iran, Iraq, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman), and southeastern Europe (the Russian Federation, Bulgaria, Albania, Kosovo, Turkey, Greece, and Spain) (https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crimean-congo-hemorrhagic-fever).

A recent phylogenetic study on CCHF viruses from the region reported that CCHF virus strains found in Pakistan and Afghanistan grouped into a new sub-clade-D within the Asia 1 genogroup. The authors postulated that endemic foci of CCHFV span the international border between Pakistan and Afghanistan with genetically diverse variants circulating in this region and the need for establishment of a laboratory based surveillance program, as well as health policy measures to control CCHF infection (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274703634_CCHF_virus_variants_in_Pakistan_and_Afghanistan_Emerging_diversity_and_epidemiology. - Mod.UBA
