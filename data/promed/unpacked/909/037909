The Bolivar [department] Secretary of Health, by means of Circular 10 of 2 May 2013, ordered the Secretariats of Health of the municipalities of San Juan Nepomuceno, Mahates, Arroyo Hondo, San Jacinto, Calamar, Maria la Baja y Arjona, in an area related to the [rabies] outbreak, to intensify their surveillance and rabies control efforts. In this [effort], adhere to the surveillance and control protocols issued by the national Ministry of Health to communicate any situation to departmental health [authorities].

The Bolivar government made this decision after detection of a sylvan [wildlife origin] outbreak of rabies in animals in a rural property in the Carreto area, jurisdiction of San Juan Nepomuceno municipality, in the area of Montes de Maria, stated the veterinarian Orlando Paz Canadas of the Zoonoses Proram of the departmental Secretariat of Health.

The health authorities in this coastal department indicated that the outbreak is controlled. However, a contingency plan was established, prevent the spread to municipalities in the center and south of Bolivar.

The ICA [Colombian Agricultural and Livestock Institute] technical leader, Elias Tamayo Rozo, explained [the outbreak involved] 2 heifers in the La Esperanza farm, one of which showed signs of bites by vampire bat (_Desmodus rotundus_) bites, samples for which were positive for sylvan rabies in the indirect immunoflourescence test done by the ICA National Diagnostic Laboratory.

Also, 7 people who had exposure to the affected livestock, and who do not show symptoms of the disease, are currently undergoing preventive treatment administered by the Ministry of Health and Social Protection and the Bolivar Secretariat of Health.

Thus, the departmental administration ordered intensification of health surveillance.

As a preventive measure, the Bolivar Secretariat of Health issued a call to owners of dogs, cats and other pets, and to livestock owners in the area, to vaccinate their animals against animal rabies as a health preventive measure given possible circulation of the virus.

According to ICA ... there are 2 different [epidemiological] types of rabies, sylvan and urban, given the type of animals that transmit it or the epidemiological cycle, although frequently wild animals infect dogs, cats and other domestic animals. Urban rabies is termed that where the virus circulates from a dog to another, and finally to humans or domestic animals.

[Vampire bat transmitted rabies to cattle occurs sporadically in Colombia. Interestingly, there was an outbreak of bovine rabies in the region of Montes de Maria has of Bolivar department in 2008. As indicated in the above report, forest rabies refers to vampire bat transmitted rabies virus that usually affects bovine animals, in which the disease is often termed bovine paralytic rabies. Bovine paralytic rabies occurs throughout the range of the bat _Desmodus rotundus_ from Mexico through tropical and subtropical regions in Central and South America. Control often involves attempts to reduce vampire bat populations, although not mentioned in the above report. Certainly, it is advisable to vaccinate cattle and pet mammals.
