Message to the people
According to the WHO and National Institute of Infectious Diseases risk assessments of new coronavirus-associated pneumonia, there are currently cases in which the possibility of limited human-to-human transmission of this disease, including among families, cannot be ruled out However, there is no clear evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. It is important to take regular infection control measures, such as cough etiquette and hand washing, given that there are many colds and flu seasons.

If you are returning or entering the country from Wuhan City, if you have symptoms such as cough or fever, please wear a mask and consult a medical institution as soon as possible. To do. In addition, please declare that you have a history of staying in Wuhan City.

(Reference) What is coronavirus?
It is a virus that causes infections widely among humans and animals. There are 6 known coronaviruses that cause human infections, but SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) and MERS-CoV (middle east respiratory syndrome) can cause serious respiratory illness. [Other coronavirus infections] are limited to non-severe symptoms such as a common cold. See the National Institute of Infectious Diseases information page for details.

[Our thanks to Dan Lucey and Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka for searching for confirmation of the information in section [1], which we identified several hours ago through a twitter feed.

From the information provided by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, it appears as though this individual may have had contact with other similarly ill individuals while in Wuhan city, but did not have known contact with the original implicated Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market. Fortunately the clinical picture described in this case was a mild, febrile illness. Pneumonia is mentioned, but no information on chest radiographs was provided.

This is now the 2nd confirmed case of the Wuhan nCoV outside of Wuhan City, Hubei China in the past few days. In both cases, the illness was described as mild, and both cases denied visiting the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market, suggesting there was transmission of this virus outside of a localized area. The confirmed case in Thailand did give a history of visiting a "fresh" market, whereas this current case in Japan states "potential close contact with unspecified pneumonia patients in China". Hence, it appears as through there may well be human to human transmission of this novel coronavirus ongoing in Wuhan. As for whether these are "rare" events, or more common events awaits to be better defined.

Kanagawa Prefecture borders to the immediate south of Tokyo (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefectures_of_Japan for a map of Japan showing prefectures). It had an estimated population of 9.1 million inhabitants in 2014. It is now considered to be part of the Greater Tokyo Metropolitan region. - Mod.MPP
