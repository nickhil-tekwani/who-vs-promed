Specialists from the United Kingdom Health Security Agency (UKHSA) have arranged for antibiotics to be offered to pupils and staff in year 1 and 2 [aged 5-7 years] at a Surrey school as a precautionary measure, following 2 cases of invasive group A streptococcal infection (iGAS) [also known as _Streptococcus pyogenes_]. Sadly, one pupil from Ashford Church of England Primary School has died, and another is in hospital but showing positive signs of recovery.

Dr Claire Winslade, health protection consultant at UKHSA South East, said: "As a precautionary measure, we have recommended antibiotics to pupils and staff in years 1 and 2, the same year groups as the individuals affected. We have provided advice to the school to help prevent further cases and will continue to monitor the situation. Information has been shared with parents about the signs and symptoms of iGAS [invasive group A streptococcal infection], which include high fever with severe muscle aches, pain in one area of the body and unexplained vomiting or diarrhoea. Anyone with these symptoms should call NHS111 immediately."

Infection with group A streptococcus bacteria usually causes a sore throat or skin rash and is passed by physical contact or through droplets from sneezing or coughing. In very rare cases, the infection can become invasive and enter parts of the body where bacteria aren't normally found, which can be serious.

A number of other illnesses typically circulate at this time of year, and parents, school and nursery staff are advised to be aware of the symptoms. Dr Winslade added: "We are also seeing cases of scarlet fever [a GAS] infection, RSV and other viral infections in the community, which are all fairly common among children. Please ensure that children stay off school if they're unwell to help minimise the spread of infections and check that they are up to date with their routine vaccinations. Always contact your GP for medical advice if you are concerned."

Because group A streptococcal disease is spread through coughing, sneezing and skin contact, it's important to have good hand hygiene and catch coughs and sneezes in tissues and throw these away. If you are unwell, stay at home and seek medical advice. This will all help limit the spread of other infections, which are common this time of year.

Parents have been warned to look out for signs of strep A after a 6 year old died and another was taken to hospital following an outbreak at a Surrey primary school. The year 1 Ashford Church of England School pupil contracted the group A streptococcal infection, which causes scarlet fever. The 2nd child at the school in Surrey who contracted strep A is believed to be recovering in hospital. A 3rd child from the same area of Ashford was also said to be suffering from scarlet fever. Staff and pupils have been given antibiotics by specialists from the UK Health Security Agency.

There have also been a rise of cases in Sheffield and Scotland, fueled by an outbreak at Annanhill Primary School in Kilmarnock.

Group A streptococcus (or strep A) is known to cause scarlet fever, throat infections and, in very rare cases, invasive disease. This can occur when bacteria get into parts of the body where bacteria are not usually found, such as the blood, muscle or the lungs. It can happen if the bacteria get past a person's defences, such as through an open wound or when a person's immune system is depleted. Most people who come into contact with the bacteria remain well and symptom-free.

An email sent by the school to parents said: "It is with the deepest regret and sadness that I have to inform you that a child in Tiger class, year 1 has sadly died after developing invasive group A streptococcal (iGAS). We are also aware that a child in a year 2 class has developed the same illness but is showing positive signs of recovery." The school said it comes as a "shock" for the whole community and that staff were seeking advice from Public Health England on actions they should take and advice they should give to parents.

[Ashford Church of England Primary School is in Surrey, a county in the south east of England, bordering Greater London (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey). A map showing the location of the Ashford school can be found at https://tinyurl.com/594zr8hn.

Over a century ago, scarlet fever was feared as a potentially lethal disease caused group A streptococcus (GAS, also known as _Streptococcus pyogenes_). Scarlet fever's mortality and morbidity waned, however, well before antibiotics became available. Since the advent of antibiotic therapy, the mortality rate of treated scarlet fever has been less than one percent. Community-wide outbreaks still occur, as has happened in the UK. However, in contrast to scarlet fever, which is a noninvasive form of GAS infection, invasive GAS infections (including bacteremia, necrotizing fasciitis, toxic shock syndrome, endocarditis, puerperal sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis) are severe and often life-threatening.

ProMED has posted multiple reports since 2013 on large outbreaks of scarlet fever throughout England and Wales (see the See Also section below). Subsequently, ProMED posted reports of outbreaks of invasive GAS infection (necrotizing fasciitis) in 2019 in England (ProMED posts Streptococcus, group A, invasive - UK (02): (England) fatal, WGS 20190807.6611267 and Streptococcus, group A, invasive - UK: (England) fatal, RFI 20190628.6542184).

Scarlet fever is usually associated with concurrent streptococcal pharyngitis, but may be associated with a streptococcal infection at other sites. The distinctive skin rash and red tongue characteristic of scarlet fever is caused by an exotoxin released by strains of _S. pyogenes_. Complications of scarlet fever include local spread of the streptococcal throat infection to involve regional lymph nodes, retropharyngeal tissues, middle ear, and sinuses, and immune-mediated diseases such as acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. However, septic complications of scarlet fever due to spread of GAS in bloodstream, such as meningitis, pyogenic arthritis, and endocarditis, rarely occur.

The incidence of GAS pharyngeal disease is highest in school-aged children (5-15 years), during winter and spring, and in a setting of crowding and close contact. Person-to-person spread from infected patients by means of respiratory droplets is the most common mode of transmission. It can rarely be spread through contaminated food (http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJM196904242801702).

The M surface protein is the major somatic virulence factor of GAS, which have been divided into serotypes based on the antigenic differences in the M protein molecule. More recently, GAS are typed on the basis of sequence analysis of the portion of the emm gene that encodes M serospecificity (https://www.cdc.gov/streplab/groupa-strep/emm-background.html).

The news report does not specify the M (emm) protein type that is involved in the current outbreak in Surrey, UK; however, upper respiratory GAS isolates having a distinctive emm type 1 (designated M1UK) increased significantly in England over the time period of 2014 to 2016, so that by 2016 it represented 84% of all emm1 strains isolated (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6838661/). The new strain's emergence coincided with a rise invasive GAS infections in the UK. The invasive GAS isolates collected in the same period in the UK were also M1UK (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(19)30446-3/fulltext). M1UK was found to produce 9 times more streptococcal exotoxin than previous version of emm type 1 isolates.

More information on this outbreak in Surrey would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources as it becomes available. - Mod.ML
