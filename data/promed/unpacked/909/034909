The Syrian regime is facing accusations from medics that its use of chemical weapons against rebel-held areas is now resulting in birth defects and genetically malformed newborns. One doctor said the incidents of stillborns at a clinic for refugees across the border in Arsal, Lebanon, was running at more than one in 10 births, while videos posted by activists show badly damaged infants being born in local clinics.

The parents of a baby born with a deformed face who died last week near Damascus have also said they are convinced that exposure to gas is responsible. The baby girl from the suburb of eastern Ghouta was born last Tuesday but died 9 hours later. Her father, 26, told the Telegraph that the doctor supervising the birth had said exposure to what the United Nations confirmed was Sarin gas was the most likely explanation for her deformity.

Sarin is a nerve agent, clear, colourless, and tasteless, with no odour. His wife inhaled the gas during an attack on the suburb last August 2013 while she was in her 1st month of pregnancy but had appeared to recover. "When the chemical attack happened my wife smelled gas and was ill," he said. "We took her to a medical point where she was showered and got better. The baby was born in a very bad way. So she died the next morning."

He dismissed suggestions that hereditary defects or other environmental factors could have been the cause. Neither his family or that of his 17-year-old wife had suffered previous incidents of deformities. Activists in eastern Ghouta are convinced the child died as a result of the mother's exposure.

More than 1000 people including women and children were killed on 21 Aug 2013 when regime forces dropped bombs and rockets on 2 separate areas of Ghouta in an effort to dislodge entrenched rebel resistance. Some 3600 people affected were treated for symptoms, according to a report by the charity, Medecins Sans Frontieres.

"The family of the baby are from east Ghouta, but they live now in another area which is under the control of the regime," said Ali Baz, the head of a network of citizen journalists in the area, Syria Mubashr. The network published a video and issued reports on the fate of the infant. "Doctors who examined the case of the dead baby confirmed that it is the 1st case after the use of chemical weapons in this region," he said.

A 2nd child died in the same area on Tuesday [13 May 2014] this week according to Beirut's Daily Star newspaper. Abu Ibrahim Bakr, the chief gynaecologist at the Zahraa Gynaecological Center in eastern Ghouta, said the latest victim had also been exposed to the attack. "The exposure to chemical weapons can absolutely cause the fetus' deformations, especially if the pregnancy is in its 1st 3 months," he told The Daily Star.

Even outside the immediate area, the effects of the attacks are marked. "We have noticed an increase in the percentage of stillborn deliveries and an increasing need to use incubators, as well as growth retardation," said Kasem al-Zein, a doctor who runs medical operations for Syrians in Arsal. "We are receiving pregnant women in Arsal from many areas such as Qusair, Homs, Kalamoon, and [outer] Damascus; they come across the border to give birth, but in some cases, the result is tragedy. We are receiving around 100 births a month in Arsal; about 12 per cent on average out of them are stillborn," he said. "The problems for newborn children are mostly occurring in women who were exposed to the chemical weapons, but, also, we have noticed that all women who lived in areas exposed to shelling by barrels and missiles are suffering fetal diseases."

In another case, a 4-month-old baby girl is receiving treatment in a hospital in Idlib province after she was born with the bottom half of her left leg and several fingers missing. The girl's mother was 2 months pregnant when she was exposed to gas during fighting in Homs last July [2013] while she was in the early stage of pregnancy. "Nine women came to the hospital (in Arsal) from Gouta, near the area attacked with the chemical weapons; 3 of them had suffered the death of a child and one meningocele [meningeal cyst/spina bifida]," Dr Kasem said. "I'm pretty sure that the increasing use of internationally banned weapons will lead to increasing of defects and tumours for newborn babies."

Christine Gosden, a British academic who has studied the after effects of exposure to chemical weapons, has identified congenital abnormalities in the offspring of survivors as well as a higher incidence of miscarriages, stillbirths, neonatal, and infant deaths. Testifying to the US congress, she said that mustard gas attacks in Halabja, Iraq, had long lasting consequences. "I was shocked by the devastating effects of these weapons, which have caused problems such as cancers, blindness, and congenital malformations," she said.

Human Rights Watch said this week that the Syrian regime continues to use gas attacks against rebels, having dropped chlorine bombs on insurgents in several cities last month [April 2014]. "Evidence strongly suggests that Syrian government helicopters dropped barrel bombs embedded with cylinders of chlorine gas on 3 towns in Northern Syria in mid-April 2014," the human rights group said.

Earlier reports said chlorine gas was used in clashes between the Syrian Army and rebels near the town of Kfar Zeita on 11-13 Apr 2014, which resulted in 2 killed and about 100 injured. Damascus blamed the chemical attack on the Islamic group Jabhat Al-Nusra, a branch of al-Qaeda operating in Syria and Lebanon.

Over 92 per cent of Syria's chemical stockpile has been removed from the country, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said at the end of April 2014. The remaining 16 containers with chemical weapons are stored near Damascus, in the area occupied by opposition groups.
