Scientists probe virus attacking juvenile lobsters in Florida
-------------------------------------------------------------
A herpes-like virus has been attacking one out of 6 juvenile lobsters in
the waters off the Florida Keys, confounding scientists. The virus is
thought to be limited to the _Panulirus argus_, or Caribbean spiny lobster.
But researchers plan to check other lobster species to see whether they are
susceptible. And though it may be a scientific stretch, researchers can't
rule out the possibility that other relatives, including New England
lobsters, could someday become infected, too.
Don Behringer, a postdoctoral student at Old Dominion University in
Norfolk, Virginia, first spotted the virus in 1999 with his adviser,
biology professor Mark Butler. "I was working on my [doctoral] dissertation
and was looking at the nutritional condition of the animals. I started
noticing the blood was a milky-white color, not characteristic of the other
lobsters," with clear blood. Other symptoms include lethargy, declining
appetite, failure to molt, and the shell turning pinkish. "When we've
exposed them in the lab, it takes 30 to 90 days to show late-stage
symptoms," Behringer said. He said he found that the smaller the animal,
the greater the likelihood it will get the virus and die.
To date, scientists don't know the origin of the virus, which most
resembles herpes, or whether it can be transferred to other fish or
crustaceans. Scientists don't believe the virus can be transferred to
humans, but they have notified the Centers for Disease Control [and
Prevention] as a precaution, Behringer said.
The spiny lobster harvest in the Keys has been declining since 2000, when 6
million pounds [2727 tonnes] were caught. "In 2002, the catch was 3 million
[1363 tonnes]," John Hunt, research administrator with the Florida Fish &
Wildlife Conservation Commission. The harvest was at 5.25 million pounds
[2386 tonnes] in 2001 and 4.5 million [2045 tonnes] for the season ending
March 2003.
Although the virus has not been confirmed as the cause for the declining
catch, Behringer and Hunt think it may play a part. If a decline in catch
is noted this season, which runs from August through March, Hunt says
that's enough for him to say that there may be a link to the virus.
The spiny lobster, valued in the Caribbean for its taste, spawns on the
coral reefs of the Keys. Then the larvae circulate in ocean currents for as
long as 14 months. When large enough, juvenile lobsters move to deeper
waters in Florida Bay looking for sponges, and finally head to the coral
reefs in the Atlantic Ocean. When the lobsters are small and living in
bushy algae, the virus attacks them. Behringer said he's planning to start
an experiment soon to find out what makes the juveniles susceptible.
Scientists are looking to see whether human pollution is the source of the
virus. Within the past 2 years, scientists have found viable bits of DNA
from human viruses in the waters of the neighborhood canals in the keys.
Florida requires that septic tanks be replaced with central sewer systems
by 2010. Yet Behringer said there is no direct evidence linking human
pollution to the virus. He said one way to determine whether water quality
is a factor is to test elsewhere in the Caribbean where the water is
considered pristine.
While he won't rule out the virus hitting other types of lobster, including
_Homarus americanus_, or New England lobster, the possibility at least for
now is thought to be remote.
New England lobsters range as far south as northern Virginia, and spiny
lobsters go as far north as North Carolina, so there is little interaction
between juveniles of each species. That, Behringer said, gives him relief.
"It is a possibility and something to look at in the future, but odds are
slim."
