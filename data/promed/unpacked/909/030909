The Chinese Agriculture Ministry said yesterday [25 May 2005] it was
checking reports of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease [FMD] in a dairy
area near Beijing.

Residents of Dabailou village in the countryside just north of the Great
Wall of China said up to 2000 cattle had been slaughtered since the disease
was found at the end of April 2005.

Agriculture Ministry officials have told foreign experts they are worried
that news of an outbreak might harm Beijing's reputation in the lead-up to
the 2008 Olympics.

An official with the Jiuxian town government, which has jurisdiction over
the area, denied any farms were being isolated because of the
disease. "Everything is normal here," he said.

As a signatory to international agreements on disease control, China is
required to report any FMD outbreaks to the UN Food and Agriculture Office
(FAO). FAO China representative Noureddin Mona said he had heard about the
outbreak near Beijing, but "not from official sources". "The most recent
communication I have from the (Chinese) Ministry (of Agriculture) was
yesterday morning and they said there was no incident anywhere near
Beijing", Dr Mona said.

It is commonly accepted in the livestock industry that FMD erupts regularly
in China, yet Beijing made its 1st report to an international body on the
disease earlier in May 2005, when it told the World Organisation for Animal
Health [OIE] of 2 small outbreaks in Jiangsu and Shandong provinces, in the
east and north respectively.

Meat and Livestock Australia's China manager Leith Tilley said consumer
demands and the desire to develop meat and livestock export markets were
driving a push towards greater transparency.

FMD is not harmful to humans, but is highly contagious among cloven-hoofed
animals.

[China's reported concern about its reputation in the lead-up to the 2008
Olympics is not baseless. Protecting participants from infectious diseases
during the games is one of the responsibilities of the host country. Similar
responsibility relates to participating animals, namely horses. For example,
the participation of horses from the USA in the equestrian sport events
during the Barcelona Olympic games in 1992 became possible only after
completed eradication of African Horse Sickness in Spain.

According to the terrestrial animal health code, China should forward to the
OIE weekly reports on FMD following its 1st report of 13 May 2005, until
eradication of the disease or its becoming endemic. - Mod.AS]
[Although neither humans nor horses are susceptible to FMD, lack of
transparency in reporting FMD leads to doubts about the reporting of human
and other animal diseases. ï¿½ Mod.JW.]
