I am currently treating an older woman with classic generalized
tetanus and concurrent buttock deep tissue infection after a pain
injection (in Santo Domingo), one week prior to the onset of
symptoms. The preliminary information suggests a home injection of an
unknown mixture (thought to be called doloneurodion) with a syringe
and needle supplied by a pharmacy/pharmaceutical company.
I will forward any further conversations with the pharmacy, if
possible. This case has been reported to the New York City Department
of Health and Mental Hygiene.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Clynes for this first-hand report.
Tetanus is an intoxication related to local infection, usually in a
wound, with the vegetative form of _Clostridium tetani_, which
produces the neurotoxin tetanospasmin, blocking inhibitory
neurotransmitters. This toxin, one of the most lethal toxins known,
will produce spasms, of which the most classical is the form called
opisthotonus
<http://www.neuro.wustl.edu/neuromuscular/pics/people/patients/tetanus2sm.jpg>.
The organism is a Gram-positive, obligately anaerobic, spore-forming
rod existing in nature as an environmentally hardy spore form.
Immunization with the tetanus toxoid will produce antitoxins to
prevent the disease, but waning immunity and/or increased immigration
of non-immunized or inadequately immunized individuals represent a
significant cause of cases in developed nations. The immunization
status of this woman is not stated.
