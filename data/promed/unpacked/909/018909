There have been 9 confirmed cases of _E. coli_ in Rice County recently; all those affected were in attendance at the Rice County Fair. Tina Schlottman, an infection prevention nurse at District One Hospital, said they have seen 4 of the 9 patients at their campus. "We are following the state guidelines on how to treat and test patients," she said. "We are working very closely with the Minnesota Department of Health." She was not able to give an update on any of the 4 patients.

According to an email that was sent to the Rice County Agriculture Society board of directors and shared with the Daily News, the Minnesota Department of Health informed fair officials last week [week of 28 Jul 2014] that a case of _E. coli_ had been reported to the department. After further investigating, it was found to have come from the county fair.

Officials from the Minnesota Department of Health did not return a call for comment on Mon 4 Aug 2014. Rice County Fair Manager John Dvorak said he was made aware of the incident last Thu 31 Jul 2014. "They determined it was coming from Rice County," he said. "But (those infected) were at other fairs prior to ours."

According to the CDC, the time between ingesting the bacterium and feeling sick is usually 3 to 4 days, but may be as long as 10 days. The Rice County Fair was held from 15-20 Jul 2014.

Dvorak said he has heard 2 different figures for the number of confirmed cases. "I have heard both 9 and 12, and I've heard 5 went to the hospital," he said.

Dvorak said the Department of Health has determined that the _E. coli_ is not food-related but rather came from an animal. "It is either from the barn or the petting zoo," Dvorak said.

Dvorak said he can't speak for the petting zoo, but said he knows they run a top-notch operation. The petting zoo has been a regular at the Rice County Fair, Dvorak said, coming for years. Wally Zerebko, owner of Zerebko Zoo-Tran, said they have been in contact with the Department of Health and have already been tested and inspected. "We had state vets come out and we have not found a problem yet," he said. He said his petting zoo is tested once a week, with additional federal testing. He added that he has never had _E. coli_ problems with his petting zoo. Zerebko said when he was at the Red River Valley Fair in 2010, the state of North Dakota tested 22 different swabs and they all came back negative for _E. coli_. "So I'm not afraid of testing," he said.

Dvorak said there are hand-washing stations available outside the petting zoo and barns, but is aware not everyone uses them. Dvorak said he will continue to be in touch with the Department of Health as the investigation continues. "I'm assuming the worst of it is over," he said.

[Although the serotype of _E. coli_ is not stated, from this and similar postings regarding this recent outbreak it is certainly likely to be an enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, either O157 or one of the other serotypes. Petting zoos at state fairs are well recognized to be a venue for transmission of this potentially lethal toxin-producing pathogen.

The CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/features/animalexhibits/) has offered this advice regarding human-livestock interactions:
"From watching calf roping at the rodeo to petting lambs at the county fair, there are many ways to explore the animal world this spring and summer. Exhibits such as petting zoos and fairs allow children of all ages to have the thrilling experience of coming face to face with animals. This interaction allows people to learn more about animals and helps to build an important human-animal bond.

Unfortunately, many people become sick every year because of a visit to an animal exhibit. It is important to remember that animals sometimes carry germs that are harmful to humans. When people forget to wash their hands after petting an animal or bring food into an area where animals are being housed, they are at risk for becoming ill.

If you are visiting an animal exhibit:
- Use hand-washing stations.
- Find out where hand-washing stations are located.
- Always wash your hands after petting animals or touching the animal enclosure, especially before eating and drinking.
- Running water and soap are best. Use hand gels if running water and soap are not available.

Food and drinks:
- Keep food and drinks out of animal areas.
- Do not share your food with animals.
- Do not eat or drink raw (unpasteurized) dairy products.

Children:
- Children younger than 5 years old need supervision.
- Never allow children to put their hands or objects (for example, pacifiers) in their mouths while interacting with animals.
- Hand washing should be supervised." - Mod.LL
