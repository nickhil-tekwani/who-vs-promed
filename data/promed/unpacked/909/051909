Fish Die-off Results in Quarantine of Fish from the Honduran Pacific Coast
----------------------------------------------------------------
TEGUCIGALPA, 12 Jan (AP) - The government established an indefinite
quarantine on [fish from] the Pacific Coast today, where hundreds of
thousands of fish have died as a result of a toxic spill in the zone.
The Vice Minister of Agriculture and Livestock Ranching, Julian Suazo, told
AP that there was a prohibition on fishing and sales of fish in the public
markets in order to avoid an epidemic in the country.
"The quarantine will last until the situation is under total control and
the government will maintain continual surveillance in the location in
order to protect the marine resources in the Gulf of Fonseca (in the
Pacific)," he added.
The Gulf is shared historically by El Salvador, Nicaragua and
Honduras. There are more than 1.2 million inhabitants of the 3 countries
in the region who use the resources of the ocean.
Suazo emphasized that "the ecologic damage is enormous and the government,
which is concerned about its occurrence, doesn't know how high the losses
will be." The authorities have not as yet determined the causes of the
contamination, although the laboratories are investigating the case.
The zone is emitting heavy fetid odors that are noxious to human beings,
resulting from the quantity of dead fish disseminated by the Pacific tides
on some 200 hectares of beach, which for the past 4 days have been cleaned
by government workers.
Suazo affirmed that "this is being treated as an environmental crime ...
and we are searching for those responsible for this tragedy."
The affected zone includes the estuaries of the Pedregal and Triunfo
[rivers] bordering with Nicaragua, where there are numerous private marine
cultivators.
On the other hand, the chief of the National Center for Studies on Control
and Contamination, Luis Guerrero, indicated that the fish could have died as
a result of natural chemical agents non-toxic to humans that are used by
the fishermen, or plaguicides released in the estuaries during the severe
floods caused by hurricane Mitch in 1998.
The executive director of the Committee for Development of the Gulf of
Fonseca, Jorge Varela, maintained that the contamination is due to organic
waste substances discharged by the marine farms in the zone.
The government affirmed in a communication that "it is unknown if there was
criminal involvement in this case, but we will carry out all appropriate
investigations in order to identify and sanction those responsible for this
crime."
The authorities, according to law, are able to fine up to 135 000 dollars
for endangering the marine wildlife in Honduras.
