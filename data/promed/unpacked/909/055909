A possible salmonella outbreak at the Kodiak Christian School sickened
nearly 50 people. Joe McLaughlin, medical epidemiologist with the Alaska
Division of Public Health said he can't say for sure what caused the
outbreak. But he said it appears to be a foodborne outbreak.

State health officials and staff from the Kodiak Public Health Center and
Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation conducted an onsite
investigation on Fri and Sat, 7-8 Nov 2003. McLaughlin said the team
interviewed potentially infected people and collected clinical and
environmental samples for testing.

Donna Schmelzenbach, principal of Kodiak Christian School, said the
outbreak occurred after a lunch eaten at the school. The outbreak was not
due to the handling of the food, but from the food itself, she said.

McLaughlin said food handlers, health care, and child care workers,
children in child-care, and those immediately surrounded by people with
salmonellosis should take precautionary measures to prevent the spreading
of salmonella. Prevention includes hand washing, cleaning everything in
contact with raw meat, cooking meats and eggs thoroughly, consuming
pasteurized dairy products, and washing produce.

[Salmonelloses are common and cosmopolitan diseases with, except for _S.
typhi_, are considered zoonoses. As can be seen below, however, often the
contact may not be with the animal (including iguanas, turtles, and snakes)
but rather with a food not animal-based that has been contaminated.

Although not elucidated in this posting, the type of Salmonella identified
-- in addition to the food survey of the school -- may give a hint as to
the source. - Mod.LL]
