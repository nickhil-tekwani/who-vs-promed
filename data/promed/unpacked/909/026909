Pune scientists rewrite diagnosis: it wasn't Japanese encephalitis
------------------------------------------------------
Contrary to reports that Japanese encephalitis was to blame for the
death of 250 children in north Andhra Pradesh and central-eastern
Maharashtra, scientists at Punes National Virology Institute (NIV)
have identified Chandipura, a rhabdovirus, as the killer.
Its the first time the countrys reporting Chandipura as a human
killer.
In its report to the Union Health Ministry, the NIV says its this virus,
and not Japanese encephalitis (JE), which is on the rampage.
Virologists listed Chandipura only once in 1980 in a sample from
Madhya Pradesh after isolating it in 1965.
In the wake of the NIV findings, Andhra Pradesh will now have to
suitably alter its anti-brain fever drive, largely planned to fight JE.
The NIV now awaits word from the Union Health authorities to act on
its "confidential report.
Contacted by The Indian Express, NIV director Dr A C Mishra
sought to divert all queries to the Indian Council for Medical
Research (ICMR) or to the Union Health Secretary. I can tell you
nothing beyond the fact that NIV has forwarded the report to ICMR
about 5 days ago, he said, refusing to elaborate on the findings.
Maharashtra Director General of Health Services Dr Subhash
Salunkhe, however, confirmed NIV had concluded that JE was not
responsible for the deaths in Nanded and Hingoli districts of
Maharashtra. The NIV is still working to identify the virus, but it
certainly is not Japanese encephalitis, Salunkhe said.
The scientific community will take some more time to develop a
rescue system for Chandipura virus as mapping the route of the
virus attacking humans will require extensive field work.
The NIV is now working on acquiring a second set of samples from
Andhra villages hit by brain fever. This was stated to be a normal
practice to test the presence of antibodies in the patients bodies.
[This refers to the practice of taking a convalescent blood sample
from survivors 2 weeks after onset of illness. - Mod JW]
Although NIV teams are yet to return from Nanded, virologists feel
the virus in Maharashtra could be similar in view of the geographical
vicinity of the fever-hit Maharashtra districts with those in Andhra.
The killer virus has played havoc in at least 10 districts of Andhra
Pradesh, with Karimnagar and Warangal reporting maximum
deaths.

[There seems to be some doubt about this diagnosis, so we should
wait for confirmation from an independent source. Chandipura virus
is a species in the genus Vesiculovirus of the family Rhabdoviridae.
It is probably arthropod-borne, as it has been isolated from
phlebotomine flies (sandflies) in India, and orally infected
Anopheles, Aedes & Culex mosquitoes have transmitted it
in the laboratry. Antibodies have been found in livestock & rhesus
monkeys, suggesting they may be reservoir hosts. - Mod.JW]
