Online dating could be partially to blame for a spike in Wake County syphilis cases that has reached a 15-year high, public health officials said Friday [18 Mar 2016].

Wake County Human Services reported 233 cases of early syphilis in 2015. Dr. Sue Lynn Ledford, public health division director, said a "striking number" of patients who were diagnosed with the sexually transmitted disease [STD] reported meeting their partners online.

"A lot of the contacts for sexual hookups are being made sometimes anonymously," Ledford said. "They don't always know they have it in the 1st phases because the symptoms can be subtle at 1st, and they just don't recognize that there is an issue." She called a rash on the hands and feet "a real identifier" for the infection, and people can also experience urinary tract problems.

The number of syphilis cases in North Carolina increased 40 percent from 2014 to 2015, according to the state Department of Health and Human Services. Men accounted for 90 percent of syphilis cases, officials said, and almost half of the men diagnosed with the infection in 2014 also had HIV.

"I think that sometimes people that are HIV positive do feel protected by those medications [anti-retroviral drugs?]," Ledford said. "That's one of the communications that we want to get out for the community that is HIV-positive: There are other STDs they need to be concerned about."

Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, but the infection causes blindness, damage to the brain and heart and even death if left untreated. "To the public, we need them to understand that unprotected sex is putting you at pretty high risk," Ledford said. "Knowing who your sexual partners are and what their health status is is also very important."

Syphilis has been so rare for so long that many doctors haven't seen it before, she said, and some cases have been misdiagnosed. "It wasn't a common thing they were seeing in the community, so sometimes they miss the symptoms," she said. "What we are trying to do is increase our educational outreach to our physicians because that is something that, if the diagnosis is missed, it increases the transmission into the population."

Wake County Human Services has scheduled an educational session for health care providers next Tuesday at its office on Sunnybrook Road. For more information on syphilis or HIV testing and treatment, call Wake County Human Services at 919-250-3950.

North Carolina health officials say that case numbers of the sexually transmitted infection syphilis are at their highest since the year 2000 and that cases increased 40 percent from 2014 to 2015. The highest numbers of cases were in some of the state's most populous counties: Cumberland, Durham, Guilford, Mecklenburg and Wake.

The majority of syphilis cases are reported in males. In calendar year 2014, men made up 90 percent of those diagnosed, and of these new cases, most were among men reporting sex with men. Those who are HIV-positive are at highest risk of contracting syphilis. In 2014, 48 percent of males diagnosed with syphilis were co-infected with HIV.

"When a sexually transmitted disease goes untreated, it will lead to other issues," said Evelyn Foust, head of the Communicable Disease Branch in the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services' Division of Public Health. "In the case of syphilis, we are seeing a rise in ocular syphilis, which may cause permanent loss of sight. We are urging individuals to be open with their healthcare provider about their sexual health and for providers to be diligent in proactively screening and educating their patients."

In February 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated a clinical advisory outlining a national increase in ocular syphilis, and diagnostic and treatment options. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, any patient who presents with classic features of syphilis, or who has had a recent sexual exposure to syphilis, should be treated [for neurosyphilis] without waiting for test results.

"Delays in the diagnosis and treatment of ocular syphilis have resulted in significant consequences for patients, including permanent visual impairment and blindness," said Victoria Mobley, M.D., HIV/STD medical director for the Communicable Disease Branch. "Syphilis has not gone away, and it's still as important as ever to practice safe sex and get tested regularly, not only to intervene early, but to limit the exposure of syphilis, HIV and other STDs to future partners."

People should be tested for all STDs if they have been sexually active with more than one partner or with a partner whose STD status is unknown. Syphilis and HIV tests are available at local health departments.

[The 1st phase of syphilis (also called primary syphilis) appears as a painless sore (also called a chancre) at the site of inoculation, usually on the genitals or mouth, which goes away even without treatment in 3-6 weeks. The next phase (secondary syphilis) begins as the chancre is healing or several weeks after the chancre has disappeared, when a rash appears on the soles of the feet and palms of the hands, as well as elsewhere on the body. Flat warts may be seen in moist areas of the skin (e.g., in the perianal area, under the breasts), in the mouth, throat, larynx, penis, vulva, or rectum. During this stage, there may be flu-like symptoms. Pain during urination and other urinary disturbances are characteristic of gonorrhea and _Chlamydia_ infection, not early syphilis.

Ocular syphilis can involve any structure of the eye, but posterior uveitis and panuveitis are the most common. Other manifestations may include anterior uveitis, optic neuropathy, retinal vasculitis and interstitial keratitis. Permanent blindness may result. Ocular syphilis can occur at any stage of syphilis, including primary and secondary syphilis. Ocular syphilis has been recently noted mainly in MSM who are co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/clinicaladvisoryos2015.htm), which may reflect an increased risk of central nervous system penetration by _Treponema pallidum_ in these patients or infection with a neuropathogenic strain of syphilis. A few cases of ocular syphilis have occurred among HIV-uninfected persons including heterosexual men and women. Ocular syphilis should be managed according to treatment recommendations for neurosyphilis (http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/clinicaladvisoryos2015.htm).

Wake, Mecklenburg, Cumberland, Durham, and Guilford Counties are located in the US state of North Carolina and are homes to some of the largest cities in the state. Wake County, with a population of about one million residents, is located in the northeast central region of the state; its county seat is the city of Raleigh, which is also the state capital and the 2nd most populous city in the state, with a population of 439 896 in 2014 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_County,_North_Carolina). Durham County is adjacent to Wake County and is included in the Raleigh-Durham-Cary, NC Combined Statistical Area, with a population of about 1.75 million residents in 2010; the city of Durham, which is its county seat and the state's 4th most populous city, is home to Duke University and is one of the 3 hub cities of the Research Triangle Park, the 2 other hub cities being Raleigh and Chapel Hill (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham_County,_North_Carolina). Mecklenburg, with a population of over one million residents, is the most populous county in North Carolina; its county seat is Charlotte, which is the state's most populous city (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecklenburg_County,_North_Carolina).
Guilford County, with a population of 488 406, is the 3rd most populous county in North Carolina; its county seat is Greensboro, the 3rd most populous city in the state (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilford_County,_North_Carolina). Cumberland County, with a population of 319 431, is the 5th-most populous county in North Carolina; its county seat is the city of Fayetteville, the 6th most populous city in North Carolina and the home of Fort Bragg, a major U.S. Army installation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumberland_County,_North_Carolina).

The news report above says there has been a dramatic increase in syphilis cases in 2015 in Wake County; men accounted for 90% of syphilis cases, most being men who have sex with men (MSM), and almost 50% were co-infected with HIV. Many were said to meet anonymous sex partners via online dating services. The pattern of high and increasing rates of primary and secondary syphilis mainly in MSM is similar to that which is occurring in many other places in the US and elsewhere, and reflects an ongoing epidemic of sexually transmitted diseases, including syphilis, in men who have sex with men (MSM).

This increased syphilis incidence has been attributed to a variety of causes that promote unprotected sex among MSM, such as engaging in sex only with partners perceived to have the same HIV status as one's own to avoid using condoms (serosorting), taking pre-exposure (PrEP) or post-exposure HIV prophylaxis, use of psychoactive "party drugs," multiple anonymous sex partners, use of Internet chat rooms to meet sex partners, use of smartphone apps, such as Grindr and Tinder, that facilitate anonymous "hookups," etc. A discussion of the risk for acquisition of sexually transmitted diseases associated with use of the Internet, mobile phones and social networking sites can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/std/life-stages-populations/Adolescents-white-paper.pdf. - Mod.ML
