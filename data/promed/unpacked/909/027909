Newspapers in Tehran today [12 Sep 2011] state that while [aware] of
the "anthrax" in Isfahan and Khorasan wildlife, officials are
concerned about environmental protection, and the veterinary
organizations do not have any information about the deaths.

So far, 10 deer carcasses (have been reported) on the plains of
Qmyshlv, and 30 carcasses (of sheep) were discovered in North Khorasan
Sarygl Wildlife Park, and a dead ram in Vmyshhay Zdhast park. People
are being warned to be careful.

Hvan (The Department of Departmental Protection) says the deaths are
not limited to Sharbvan disease (anthrax), and the disease diagnosis
is still unconfirmed (according to experts).

The deaths in the Sarygl National Park of the North Khorasan, said
Hossein Mohammadi, Wildlife Bureau Director General of Environment,
were of 30 head of sheep in the park, according to a report from the
Mhytbanan [This is, I think, another environment/park protection
unit.].

There is a probability of a bad day for Iranian wildlife. However,
Mohammadi said that the Sarygl Veterinary Organization has announced
an "unknown disease" as the cause of the deaths.

[Our heartfelt thanks to Sabine and Susan for their hard work in
finding and obtaining a translation of the original report. We look
forward to seeing the results of the confirmatory examinations and for
any related commentaries by our readers in Tehran.

While Iran was once in sight of this disease being truly sporadic,
latterly, outbreaks have been reported throughout the country.
