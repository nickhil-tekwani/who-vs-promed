Brazil confirmed 920 [yellow fever] cases and 300 deaths in the period [1 Jul 2017 to 13 Mar 2018]. During the same period last year, there were 610 confirmed cases and 196 deaths.

The Ministry of Health updated the information on [Wed 14 Mar 2018] provided by the state secretariats of health concerning the yellow fever situation in the country. During the monitoring period [1 Jul 2017 to 13 Mar 2018] there were 920 confirmed cases of yellow fever in the country with 300 deaths. In total, during this period 3483 suspected cases were reported, of which 1794 were discarded and 769 remain under investigation.

Last year from July 2016 to [13 Mar 2017], there were 610 confirmed cases and 196 confirmed deaths. These reports of yellow fever cases show a pattern of disease seasonality, occurring mainly in summer, with the period of analysis considered to be [1 Jul-30 Jun] of each year.

Although the number of cases of the current monitoring period have been higher than during the previous season, yellow fever today circulates in metropolitan regions of the country that have the greatest contingent of the population, hitting 32.5 million, including people who live in areas that never had recommendations for [yellow fever] vaccination. In the past season, for example, the outbreak hit a population [at risk] of 8.9 million people.

This explains why the incidence of the disease in this period is lower than in the past period. The incidence of the disease in the monitoring period until [13 Mar 2018] is 2.4 cases for 100 000 inhabitants. In the past season (2016/2017), the incidence was 6.8/100 000 inhabitants, in the same period [but with a smaller population at risk].

Preliminary data sent by the health departments of the states of Bahia, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo to the Ministry of Health indicate that the 3 states, before starting the vaccination campaign, had vaccinated about 11.3 million people. During the campaign, up to [13 Mar 2018], 17.8 million people were immunized, which corresponds to 78.6 per cent of the target population. A total of 8.8 million people were vaccinated in São Paulo (94.9 per cent), 6.9 million in Rio de Janeiro (68.5 per cent) and 1.8 million in Bahia (54.3 per cent).

[Although the yellow fever (YF) outbreak was declared over last year (2017), cases continue to increase, albeit slowly. The above report provides a good update on the current YF situation in Brazil. There is no indication that the outbreak has ended. Although there have been no reports of cases from the urban, _Aedes aegypti_, cycle of transmission the risk remains that spill-over from the sylvan (forest) cycle could occur. _Aedes aegypti_ vector mosquitoes are present in the area and responsible for the transmission of dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses. It is important to note from the case numbers above that cases of YF in humans and monkeys are occurring in areas outside of the 3 states where the outbreak is occurring. There is risk of new human cases and outbreaks in other areas, so that surveillance in a broad area of Brazil is important.

[2] Risk assessment

Rapid risk assessment: outbreak of yellow fever in Brazil, 3rd update, 16 March 2018
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Executive summary
Conclusions
-----------
In September 2017, the Ministry of Health in Brazil declared the end of the 2016-2017 yellow fever outbreak in the country. The upsurge of human cases since December 2017 and the continuous non-human primate epizootics since September 2017 indicate a continued or resumed increase in yellow fever virus circulation in Brazil. Since January 2018, most of the yellow fever cases have been reported from São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais states.

To date, an urban cycle of yellow fever transmission by _Aedes aegypti_ (or _Aedes albopictus_) has not been documented in Brazil. However, the detection of non-human primate cases in the vicinity of the metropolitan regions of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro remains of concern, especially in areas with suboptimal vaccination coverage. This is particularly relevant for municipalities that were previously not considered at risk for yellow fever and where routine yellow fever vaccination was not indicated. Therefore, the possibility of an urban cycle of yellow fever transmission remains.

Since January 2018, Brazilian national health authorities have been intensifying and extending vaccination activities through mass yellow fever vaccination campaigns in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo states. Additional vaccination campaigns have been conducted in Bahia State since February 2018. The overall target population was around 22.7 million people. According to the Brazilian authorities, as of 13 March 2018, preliminary results of the mass yellow fever vaccination campaign indicate that 17.5 million people have been vaccinated.

The risk of yellow fever importation and subsequent transmission in continental Europe is currently very low because the risk of the virus being introduced by viraemic travellers into an area with established, competent and active mosquito vector population is very low.

[The risk of ongoing yellow fever virus transmission in temperate Europe is essentially nil. However, should a viremic individual arrive in some areas in southern Europe that do have established populations of _Aedes albopictus_ during summer months there is a possibility of local transmission, as has been the case with chikungunya virus in Italy in the past. How efficient these southern European mosquitoes would be as yellow fever virus vectors is not known. - Mod.TY]

In response to a large, ongoing outbreak of yellow fever in multiple states of Brazil, including near large urban areas and popular tourist destinations, CDC is recommending travelers to the country to protect themselves from yellow fever by getting the yellow fever vaccine at least 10 days before travel, and taking steps to prevent mosquito bites during their travel.

CDC recommends that people who are unable to get yellow fever vaccine or aren't recommended to get it, should avoid traveling to areas of Brazil where yellow fever vaccination is recommended. Travelers going to areas with ongoing outbreaks may consider getting a booster dose of yellow fever vaccine if it has been 10 or more years since they were vaccinated.

Yellow fever vaccine is available at a limited number of clinics in the United States, so travelers should plan ahead to get the vaccine. For more on yellow fever vaccination clinics: https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellow-fever-vaccination-clinics/search.

Brazilian public health authorities announced in early 2017 an outbreak of yellow fever in several eastern states of Brazil, including areas where yellow fever was not traditionally considered to be a risk. Since the end of 2017, yellow fever cases have reoccurred in several states, especially in the states of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, and São Paulo, including areas close to the city of São Paulo.

In early 2018, a case of yellow fever was reported in an unvaccinated Dutch traveler who had stayed near the São Paulo metropolitan region. Since then, there have been reports of other unvaccinated travelers to Brazil who visited areas with yellow fever outbreaks and contracted yellow fever; many of these travelers were infected on the island of Ilha Grande (Rio de Janeiro State) and 4 travelers have died in this outbreak.

[Based on the large number of states in Brazil that have had at least a few cases of yellow fever during this reporting period (see the Brazil Ministry of Health report above), it would be prudent for travelers to any of these reporting states to receive the vaccine prior to traveling. - Mod.TY]

Outbreak of yellow fever in Brazil, 3rd update
----------------------------------------------
[The background of the current yellow fever outbreak in Brazil is omitted because it is the same as given in the above reports. - Mod.TY]

Options for response
Advice to travellers
--------------------
EU/EEA citizens who travel to, or live in areas at risk of yellow fever in Brazil and other countries in South America are advised to:

1. Check their vaccination status and get vaccinated if necessary, in accordance with national and WHO recommendations. Vaccination against yellow fever is recommended by WHO for people visiting or living in yellow fever risk areas, from 9 months of age and without contraindication. An individual risk-benefit analysis should be conducted by professionals in tropical or travel medicine centres prior to vaccination, taking into account the period, destination, duration of travel and likelihood of being bitten by mosquitoes as well as individual risk factors for adverse events following yellow fever vaccination.

2. Take measures to prevent mosquito bites indoors and outdoors, especially between sunrise and sunset when mosquito vectors are most active. This also applies to places such as large recreational areas and parks, botanical gardens and natural reserves. The measures include:
- the use of mosquito repellent in accordance with the instructions indicated on the product label;
- wearing long-sleeved shirts and long trousers;
- sleeping or resting in screened/air-conditioned rooms or using mosquito nets at night and during the day.

International travellers returning from affected areas may be requested to show proof of yellow fever vaccination (or a contraindication certificate) when entering countries or territories infested with _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes.

Vaccination requirements and recommendations for international travellers are available from the World Health Organization's website.

Advice to health professionals
------------------------------
Physicians, health professionals and travel health clinics should be provided with, or have access to regularly updated information on areas with ongoing yellow fever transmission and should consider yellow fever in the differential diagnoses for illnesses in unvaccinated travellers returning from at-risk areas. To reduce the risk of adverse events following immunisation, healthcare practitioners responsible for yellow fever vaccinations should be aware of the contraindications and follow the manufacturers' advice on precautions before administering yellow fever vaccine.

Option for EU Overseas Countries and Territories and Outermost Regions with presence of _Aedes aegypti_
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In the EU Overseas Countries and Territories and EU Outermost Regions where _Aedes aegypti_ is established or has been introduced, verification of yellow fever vaccination status should be considered for travellers coming from Brazil in order to reduce the risk of yellow fever importation and subsequent spread.

Options for the safety of substances of human origin (SoHO)
-----------------------------------------------------------
The risks and options for the safety of substances of human origin (SoHO) remain the same as in the 2nd updated ECDC rapid risk assessment, published on 18 Jan 2018.

[The risk of acquisition of a YF infection in Brazil by an unvaccinated traveler is small but real. The WMMR of the USA CDC reported that since January 2018, 10 travel-related cases of yellow fever, including 4 deaths, have been reported in international travelers returning from Brazil. None of the 10 travelers had received yellow fever vaccination. Of these cases, 5 of the 10 have been reported by ProMED-mail since 15 Jan [2018], including 2 from Argentina and 3 from Chile; 2 of the travelers from Chile died. In addition, during 1 Jan - 15 Mar 2018, 5 confirmed cases of yellow fever in unvaccinated travelers returning from Brazil were reported by GeoSentinel (http://www.istm.org/geosentinel), the global clinician-based sentinel surveillance system for travel-related illness among international travelers and migrants. These 5 yellow fever cases represent the 1st such cases identified by GeoSentinel. The 1st of the GeoSentinel-reported cases occurred in a Dutch man aged 46 years who traveled to SãoPaulo state for 3 weeks during December 2017-January 2018. The 2nd case occurred in a French woman, aged 42 years, who traveled to Minas Gerais state in Brazil for 4 weeks during December 2017-January 2018. The 3rd and 4th cases occurred in a Romanian man, aged 34 years, and a Swiss man, aged 44 years, each of whom visited Brazil for approximately 2 weeks in February 2018. The 5th case was in a German man, aged 33 years, who spent a week in Brazil in late February 2018. The Swiss and German travelers died from their illness. Among the 10 international travelers reported with yellow fever acquired in Brazil, 8 acquired the disease on Ilha Grande, a forested island off the Rio de Janeiro coast, where one human and one nonhuman primate yellow fever case were reported in early February 2018. Of the 8 patients who acquired the disease on Ilha Grande, 4 died. Another travel-related case of yellow fever was reported recently outside of Brazil.
