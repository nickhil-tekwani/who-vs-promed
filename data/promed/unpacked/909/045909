Federal officials said today [Wed 28 Apr 2021] that they are investigating a new foodborne _E. coli_ outbreak, but they have not yet identified a source. There are 15 people confirmed ill across 3 states, according to the CDC.

Investigators have begun traceback work on a food or foods, but the FDA has not released any details about the traceback. The CDC did not identify which states have patients, but a spokesperson for the agency said state officials are assisting with the outbreak investigation. Additional patients are likely to be identified, because it can take up to a month or more after a person becomes ill and when federal officials receive confirmation from states.

This is the 3rd outbreak of unknown origin that the FDA has investigated so far in 2021. The other 2 involved _Salmonella_ Miami, which sickened at least 65 people, and _E. coli_ O157:H7, which sickened at least 22 people. _E. coli_ O145:H28 is the pathogen involved in the new outbreak.

Neither the FDA nor the CDC has posted outbreak announcements, except for one line of data in the FDA's weekly update on its CORE investigations unit. The FDA has not posted any recall notices in relation to the outbreak.

About _E. coli_ infections
-----------------------
Anyone who has developed symptoms of _E. coli_ infection should seek medical attention and tell their doctor about their possible exposure to the bacteria. Specific tests are required to diagnose the infections, which can mimic other illnesses. The symptoms of _E. coli_ infections vary for each person but often include severe stomach cramps and diarrhea, which is often bloody. Some patients may also have a fever. Most patients recover within 5-7 days. Others can develop severe or life-threatening symptoms and complications, according to the CDC.

About 5-10% of those diagnosed with _E. coli_ infections develop a potentially life-threatening kidney failure complication, known as a hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Symptoms of HUS include fever, abdominal pain, feeling very tired, decreased frequency of urination, small unexplained bruises or bleeding, and pallor. Many people with HUS recover within a few weeks, but some suffer permanent injuries or death. This condition can occur among people of any age but is most common in children younger than 5 years old because of their immature immune systems, older adults because of deteriorating immune systems, and people with compromised immune systems such as cancer patients.

People who experience HUS symptoms should immediately seek emergency medical care. People with HUS will likely be hospitalized because the condition can cause other serious and ongoing problems such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease, brain damage, and neurologic problems.

[Hopefully, analysis will identify a vehicle for this outbreak due to a non-O157 EHEC. - Mod.LL
