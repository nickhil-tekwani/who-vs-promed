[1] New York: raccoon, dog, human exposure

The Oneida County Health Department is urging residents to know how to recognize the signs of rabies after a raccoon in the town of Sangerfield tested positive for rabies on 18 Mar [2020].

The health department says 2 adults and a dog were exposed to the rabid raccoon. Both adults were given post-exposure prophylaxis, while the dog was reportedly current on its vaccinations and received a booster shot.

According to the department, signs of rabies include the following:

- The animal is acting strangely;
- The animal might act mad (aggressive);
- The animal might act shy (it might let you get unusually close); and
- Drooling

If you see an animal exhibiting any of these signs, the health department says to not approach; stay away and call your local animal control officer.

For more information on rabies prevention, you can contact the Oneida County Health Department.

[2] Colorado: bull

The Pueblo Department of Public Health issued an alert about a bull testing positive for rabies in the Beulah area of Pueblo County.

According to a release from the department on Friday [10 Apr 2020], the bull is the 1st to have rabies in Pueblo County. It's not clear how the bull contracted the virus, but the department did note several skunks in the Beulah and Rye areas have tested positive for rabies this year [2020].

"With the growing prevalence of rabid skunks, it is important to vaccinate pets and livestock for rabies," stressed Randy Evetts, public health director at the Pueblo Department of Public Health and Environment.

The bull was tested on Saturday [4 Apr 2020] but died Tuesday [7 Apr 2020]; the results confirming rabies were received on Thursday [9 Apr 2020], according to the department. Everyone who has been in contact with the bull will need to receive "post-exposure rabies vaccinations." [This paragraph is a little unclear. The bull could not be tested for rabies prior to its death, so I wonder if it was tested for something else or if the rabies test was performed on the Saturday following the animal's death, and confirmation was received on the Thursday following. - Mod.TG]

The following tips were provided by the health department regarding rabies in animals:

Never touch a stray or any other wild animal. Healthy skunks, raccoons, and animals typically come out in the evening. If the animals are acting tame or extremely aggressive, especially in the day, they may be sick. Children who find wild animals should leave them where they are, not touch them, and tell an adult.

Do not pick up any injured animal with your hands, even if you're wearing gloves. Use a shovel to place it in a bucket or bag if the animal must be moved.

If you are bitten by a stray, wash the bite thoroughly with soap and water, then contact both your physician and the Health Department.

If you are bitten by a wild animal, wash the bite thoroughly with soap and water then contact both your physician and the USDA Wildlife Specialist.

Make sure your pets are vaccinated against rabies. Keep in mind vaccines not administered by a licensed veterinarian are not considered valid vaccinations in the state of Colorado, including Pueblo County.

[Rabies can affect any mammal.

There are 2 forms: the furious form, and the dumb form. The furious form is what most people think of, with profuse salivating, viciousness, and unprovoked biting. The dumb form is when a normally active animal is timid, withdrawn, and seems shy. It may or may not salivate slightly. It may not eat and may seem quite lethargic, leading many people to believe it may have an injury, especially an internal injury. This animal may also be very interesting to pets who are quite curious. However, both types of clinical signs, the dumb or the furious type, can transmit rabies to our pets and to people.

The article regarding the dogs and raccoons seems like it was more likely the furious form of the disease with the raccoon defending himself and landing a solid bite on both dogs.

The article about the bull mentions skunks because they are often the ones sauntering through a pasture with their unusual gait, which attracts the attention of the pasture animals, in this case the bull. The bulls put their nose down to check out this curious little creature and promptly get their nose bitten. This may or not result in the skunk getting stomped on and dying, or the larger animal may back up and give this odd and smelly creature a wide berth. The same may happen with raccoons, but it seems to be less frequent, at least with bovines. Horses and other livestock are equally curious about animals in their pasture and are equally susceptible to rabies.

While we are not told if the bull exposed anyone to rabies, it is possible.

It is important to the health and safety of your animals, yourself, and your pets, as well as to your family, employees, and livestock, to vaccinate all your animals, including your livestock and any household pets. There are vaccines available for horses, cattle, sheep, goats, dogs, cats, and other animals. Your veterinarian is a valuable resource. Companion animals must have a rabies vaccine given by a licensed veterinarian. Your veterinarian may advise you and help you with livestock. - Mod.TG
