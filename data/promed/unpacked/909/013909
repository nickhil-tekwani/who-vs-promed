The map of rinderpest posted by FAO on the Web inacurately shows spread
throughout the region into Mozambique, Zaire and elsewhere. There is no
doubt that RP has entered Kenya and parts of Tanzania, but the
[cartographic] hyperbole is unwarranted. Sadly, the FAO is creating a crisis
paradigm on rinderpest in East Africa in order to obtain external funding
for an emergency program of its own. The Pan African Rinderpest Campaign
(PARC) is aware of the problem and could use assistance in reversing the
spread; but a new effort by FAO will just serve to further obfuscate an
already confused situation.
