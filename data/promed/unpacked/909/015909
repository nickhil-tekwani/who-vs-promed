Abstract
--------
Enterotoxigenic _Escherichia coli_ (ETEC) is now recognized as a common cause of foodborne outbreaks. This study aimed to describe the 1st ETEC O169 outbreak identified in Korea. In this outbreak, we identified 1642 cases from 7 schools. Retrospective cohort studies were performed in 2 schools; and case-control studies were conducted in 5 schools.

In 2 schools, radish kimchi was associated with illness; and in 5 other schools, radish or cabbage kimchi was found to have a higher risk among food items. Adjusted relative risk of kimchi was 5.87-7.21 in schools that underwent cohort studies; and adjusted odds ratio was 4.52-12.37 in schools that underwent case-control studies.

ETEC O169 was isolated from 230 affected students, and was indistinguishable from the isolates detected from the kimchi product distributed by company X, a food company that produced and distributed kimchi to all 7 schools. In this outbreak, we found that the risk of a kimchi-borne outbreak of ETEC O169 infection is present in Korea. We recommend continued monitoring regarding food safety in Korea, and strengthening surveillance regarding ETEC O169 infection through implementation of active laboratory surveillance
to confirm its infection.

[Kimchi (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimchi), also spelled kimchee or gimchi, is a traditional fermented Korean side dish made of vegetables with a variety of seasonings. In traditional preparation kimchi was often allowed to ferment underground in jars for months at a time. It is Korea's national dish, and there are hundreds of varieties made with a main vegetable ingredient such as napa cabbage, radish, scallion, or cucumber and is also a main ingredient for many Korean dishes.

There are 6 pathotypes of _E. coli_ that cause enteric illness in man: enterohemorrhagic (EHEC), enteropathogenic (EPEC), enterotoxigenic (ETEC), enteroaggregative (EAEC), enteroinvasive (EIEC), and diffusely adherent _E. coli_ (DAEC). Only EHEC is a zoonosis. The large serotype O104:H4 outbreak centered in northern Germany was is chimeric organism having features of both EHEC and EAEC and is not a zoonosis either. Each organism has different pathogenic mechanisms.

The following is the FDA Bad Bug Book section on ETEC (http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM297627.pdf#page73):

1. Organism
Enterotoxigenic _Escherichia coli_ (ETEC) are highly motile, Gram negative, rod-shaped bacteria. They are characterized by production of several virulence factors, including both heat-labile (LT) toxin and heat-stable (ST) toxins, as well as several colonization-factor antigens.

2. Disease
ETEC causes gastroenteritis in humans and is best known as the causative agent of travelers' diarrhea. It is also an important cause of diarrhea in infants, in less-developed countries.

Mortality: the WHO attributes 380 000 deaths (worldwide) to ETEC, mostly among children, each year.
- Infective dose: volunteer feeding studies showed that a high dose, ranging from 10 million to 10 billion ETEC cells, may be needed to cause an infection in adults. Children may be affected by a smaller dose.
- Onset: usually 26 hours after ingestion of contaminant, but can range from 8 to 44 hours.
- Disease/complications: illness from ETEC is usually self-limiting, mild, and brief. However, some severe forms last longer and resemble cholera, with up to 5 or more daily passages of rice-water-like stools that result in severe dehydration. Antibiotic treatment usually is not required in ETEC infections, but seems to be effective in reducing the duration and severity of illness. In infants and elderly and debilitated patients, particularly, appropriate electrolyte replacement therapy may be necessary.

Symptoms: infection is characterized by sudden onset of diarrhea that is watery and without blood or mucus, rarely accompanied by high fever or vomiting. Other symptoms include abdominal cramps, low-grade fever, nausea, and malaise.

Duration of symptoms: most cases last a few days; however, severe forms can last up to 19 days.
- Route of entry: oral.
- Pathway: after ingestion, ETEC colonizes the small intestine, where the toxins that induce fluid secretion are produced.

3. Frequency
ETEC outbreaks are infrequent in the USA, but infections are a more common occurrence among travelers to foreign countries. ETEC infections are endemic in many developing tropical countries and areas with poor hygiene standards. Infections are more prevalent in the warmer, wet months.

4. Sources
Most ETEC outbreaks are linked to consumption of contaminated food or water. ETEC is often found in feces of asymptomatic carriers, and humans appear to be the most likely source of ETEC. In 1975, a large outbreak affecting 2000 people was traced to sewage-contaminated water at a national park. Contaminated well water in Japan and water supplies aboard cruise ships also have been implicated in ETEC outbreaks. Foodborne outbreaks of ETEC have occurred in restaurants and at various catered functions.

Examples of implicated foods include Brie cheese, curried turkey, mayonnaise, crabmeat, deli food, and salads. In most of these cases, foods became contaminated with ETEC via infected food handlers or through the use of contaminated water during preparation. ETEC infection does not appear to be transmitted by person-to-person contact, but some hospital infections have occurred and probably were caused by unsanitary conditions.

5. Diagnosis
During the acute phase of infection, large numbers of ETEC cells are excreted in feces. Since generic _E. coli_ are also abundantly present in the bowels, ETEC strains can be differentiated from other _E. coli_ by in vitro immunochemical assays, tissue culture, or gene probes and PCR assays specific for LT and ST toxin genes. Commercial kits that use antibodies to detect these toxins are also available.

6. Target populations
Infants and travelers to underdeveloped countries are most at risk of ETEC infection. As with other infections, people with weak immune systems are more likely than others to suffer severe, even life-threatening cases.

7. Food analysis
Presence of ETEC in foods can be determined by plating culture enrichment of food samples onto media that are selective and differential for _E. coli_ and testing the isolates for presence of LT and ST toxins, using PCR or commercial kits that use antibodies specific to the toxins. Because of its high infectious dosage, ETEC analyses usually are not performed unless generic _E. coli_ levels are very high.

The following is from a 1993 MMWR piece on 2 ETEC outbreaks in the USA (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00025017.htm):

Editorial note: since 1975, 13 outbreaks of ETEC gastroenteritis in the USA have been reported to CDC; 4 (31 percent) of these outbreaks, including the 2 described in this report, occurred in 1993. Although each of the 4 outbreaks in 1993 and 5 outbreaks reported previously were foodborne, ETEC outbreaks associated with waterborne and person-to-person transmission have been described (1,2). At least 1 foodborne ETEC outbreak in the USA was attributed to spread from an infected food handler (3) and another to imported contaminated food (4). However, none of the recent foodborne outbreaks were associated with these sources. Salads containing raw vegetables have been associated with ETEC infection (5).

Because ETEC is not detected by standard stool culture methods for _Salmonella_, _Shigella_, _Vibrio_, or other enteric bacterial pathogens and because symptoms of ETEC infection are relatively nonspecific, outbreaks caused by ETEC may be incorrectly attributed to a viral etiology. Watery diarrhea is the predominant symptom of ETEC infection, usually reported by more than 90 percent of patients (3-5). The diarrhea is often accompanied by abdominal cramps and is generally mild, although severe dehydrating diarrhea has been reported (6). 2 to 13 percent of patients report vomiting (3-5).

In contrast to illness caused by ETEC, gastroenteritis from infection with Norwalk virus is usually characterized by vomiting but not by diarrhea (7). Because nausea, headache, and myalgias occur with varying frequency in association with ETEC and Norwalk virus infections, these symptoms are less useful for differentiating the 2 illnesses (3-5,7). The incubation periods are similar for ETEC and Norwalk gastroenteritis (range: 24-48 hours) (2-4,7). However, duration of illness is shorter for Norwalk gastroenteritis (usually less than or equal to 3 days) and longer for illness caused by ETEC infection (often greater than 4 days) (1-5,7).

Laboratory identification of ETEC depends on testing _E. coli_ isolates by methods that are not widely available. For well characterized outbreaks of watery diarrheal illness for which no pathogen has been identified during routine bacteriologic examinations, arrangements can be made through local and state health departments to send isolates to CDC for testing. ETEC previously has been recognized primarily as a cause of traveler's diarrhea. However, the findings in this report indicate that clinicians and microbiologists may need to consider ETEC in patients with diarrheal illness who did not travel (8).
