The Fort restaurant in Jefferson County, where world leaders dined
with President Bill Clinton during the G7 Summit in 1997, is the
source of a recent salmonella outbreak, according to local health officials.

Investigators with the Jefferson County health department reported 8
confirmed cases and 20 probable cases in which people became ill
after dining at the well-known restaurant in the [Rocky Mountain]
foothills, said Nancy Braden, a health department spokeswoman.

The outbreak happened between 10 and 16 Jul 2010 and was triggered by
dishes, including rattlesnake cakes, that included eggs. The
restaurant specializes in wild game and Old West recipes.

Jefferson County Health Department staff traced the cause of the
illnesses to eggs that likely were undercooked.

[It seems the case that the actual source of the salmonellosis here
was undercooked eggs in a number of dishes including rattlesnake
cakes, a dish similar to crab cake. Although the serotype of _S.
enterica_ is not given, those associated with eggs tend to be
different than those associated with reptiles.

A recipe for rattlesnake cakes from cooks.com
(<http://www.cooks.com/rec/doc/0,1926,146184-254203,00.html>) is shown below:

1 rattlesnake per person
Crab boil
1 egg
Salt & pepper
Green onion
2 tbsp oil

Gut the rattlesnake and peel the skin off. Cook in a crab boil (water
+ lemon + seed package for crab or shrimp). Cool and peel off the
strips of meat. Chop and combine with egg to bind, salt and pepper
and a bit of green onion. Saute in oil until brown on both sides.
Serve with tartar sauce. - Mod. LL]
