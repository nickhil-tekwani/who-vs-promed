[On Wed 14 Nov 2001, 2 additional cases of human West Nile virus infection
were reported from Massachusetts (the first in that state) bringing the
total of human infections to at least 47 for the 2001 season. One of the
two Massachusetts patients died, bringing the total number of deaths to 4
for the 2001 season according to the above figures. The above MMWR report
still under-records the number of confirmed equine cases in 2001. The most
recent USDA-APHIS Report covering the period 1 Jan to 31 Oct 2001 (see:
West Nile virus surveillance (30) 20011105.2745) lists 344 confirmed and 3
probable cases of clinical West Nile virus (WNV) infection in horses from
18 States. - Mod.CP
[Note that posting of this summary was delayed. An additional human death
and a horse death have been reported in the interim (see ProMED-mail
