Three new cases of measles have been confirmed by the state Department of Health. One case is on Maui and 2 on Kauai, and none are related, with separate travel histories. But each involves unvaccinated young adults with recent travel either to the Philippines or Indonesia and Malaysia, the health department said in a press release.

"Measles is highly contagious, spreading through the air by breathing, coughing or sneezing and infecting 90 per cent of the contacts who are not immune," said Dr Sarah Y Park, state epidemiologist. "Measles outbreaks continue to occur both internationally and on the mainland, especially in areas where vaccination is declining. As travel increases during the holiday season, so does our chance of seeing more cases."

Since January [2014], there have been 594 cases of measles reported in 22 states according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including 2 cases in Hawaii reported earlier this year [2014] in February 2014. With the additional recently confirmed cases, Hawaii now has a total of 5 confirmed cases reported in the state this year, the state said.

Symptoms of measles include blotchy red rash, fever, cough, runny nose, red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis), feeling run-down and achy (malaise), tiny white spots with bluish-white centers found inside the mouth. Anyone with symptoms should consult a doctor immediately.

The measles outbreak has killed 7 people so far, health authorities say. The latest fatality was a 6 month old baby from Western Province.

Supervising permanent secretary of the Ministry of Health Dr Tenneth Dalipanda said that to date up to 3802 cases have been reported to the Ministry. "Cases are being reported from all 10 provinces, with increasing numbers of suspected cases being reported from Western, Malaita and Renbel provinces," Dalipanda said. The measles outbreak was 1st reported in the middle of this year [2014]. A national measles vaccination campaign was launched on 25 Sep 2014 in response to steadily increasing cases, aimed at vaccinating everyone aged 6 months to 30 years, excluding pregnant women.

Dalipanda said the ministry is now focusing on supporting Provincial Emergency Operation Centres to roll out the measles campaign in their respective provinces. "The fight against measles is not over yet," he said. "There is no room for complacency. Measles is a serious disease that can cause death and disability." Everyone living outside Honiara aged 6 months to 30 years must get a measles vaccination from the nearest health clinic, satellite site or mobile vaccination team. "Babies and young children are particularly at risk," Dalinpanda added. He said a total of 512 000 doses of measles-rubella (MR) vaccine have now arrived in the country, providing enough vaccines to cover everyone aged 6 months to 30 years in all provinces. "Mobile teams of nurses and health promotion officers are working hard to reach communities in all 10 provinces. "We ask parents, teachers, chiefs, youth and church leaders to join us in helping to protect the health of our people and our children." Dalinpanda said the ministry continues to work with WHO, UNICEF, the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and other partners to control the outbreak.

A 24 year old male student was confirmed to be the 21st measles case of the year at Ren-ai Township in Nantou County, said the [Taiwanese] Centers for Disease Control (CDC) yesterday [21 Oct 2014].

According to the CDC, symptoms such as fever, runny nose and red rashes started to appear for this student on 9 Oct 2014. The student went to a doctor on 13 Oct 2014. As the local doctor suspected that it might be measles, the case was reported to the CDC and confirmed to be measles yesterday [21 Oct 2014]. Due to the fact that the patient did not have any travel history, the CDC deemed that it is a local case and needs to be followed up on to prevent a potential outbreak of measles infection around the neighbourhood.

The local health department has already tracked down 198 people who had contact with the patient, including his family, classmates, colleagues at a fast food chain and health care workers. So far, none of them have similar symptoms. Still, these people will be under observation until 1 Nov 2014. In addition, since the patient has a part-time job at a McDonalds located on Xueshi Road in Taichung, the CDC reminded citizens who had been to this fast food restaurant from 5-13 Oct 2014 to examine themselves. If similar symptoms show up, they need to go to the doctor as soon as possible and report their recent history of interpersonal contact for the health department to investigate. People can be infected easily if they have not been vaccinated with MMR vaccine. Therefore, the CDC reminded people to take their children who are over a year old to receive an MMR vaccine to prevent possible infection. The CDC also stated that health departments and doctors should be aware of any possible measles case and report it to authorities as soon as possible to prevent the disease from spreading. In addition, people should also report their travel experiences to the doctor if measles symptoms show up.

http://www.skynews.com.au/news/local/brisbane/2014/10/20/measles-outbreak-on-jetstar-flight.html


Passengers who flew from Indonesia to Brisbane last Wednesday [15 Oct 2014] are being urged to contact their general practitioner if they feel unwell, after 3 people on the flight contracted measles. Queensland Health has called on all passengers who flew on Jetstar Airlines flight JQ46, which left Denpasar [Bali, Indonesia] on 15 Oct 2014, to carefully monitor for symptoms of the highly contagious disease.

Acting senior director of communicable diseases, Dr Alun Richards, said measles was highly contagious among people who were not fully immunised. It is spread through coughing and sneezing, and symptoms can include fever, tiredness, runny nose, cough and sore red eyes, which usually last for several days before a red, blotchy rash appears. Complications can include an ear infection and diarrhoea as well as more serious and potentially life threatening conditions such as pneumonia or swelling of the brain.

Susceptible passengers who may have been exposed to measles on this flight could expect symptoms to appear any time between 23 Oct and 3 Nov 2014. Local public health units will be contacting passengers who were seated closest to the infected passengers. Other passengers who develop symptoms should phone ahead when seeking medical attention to ensure they don't share the waiting area with other patients, Dr Richards said.

This year [2014], 59 Queenslanders have suffered measles, having caught it overseas or from someone else who caught it overseas, Dr Richards said.
