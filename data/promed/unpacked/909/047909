Dutch authorities said on Sunday [16 Nov 2014] the bird flu identified at a poultry farm in the country was the highly contagious H5N8 strain 1st detected in Europe less than 2 weeks ago.

The strain, which was found at a farm in northeastern Germany on 4 Nov 2014, hit Asia severely, where it led to massive culling of animals in the countries affected.

Though the strain has never been detected in humans, a spokesman for the Dutch government said the variant was lethal to birds and could infect humans who came into very close contact with them.

[The HPAI H5N8 virus strain from Germany (turkey farm) has been found "very similar" to viruses detected in poultry in China, the Republic of Korea and Japan during this year [2014]. The same virus has recently been found in Japan in fecal samples from _Cygnus columbianus_ (tundra swan).

Russia's Rosselkhoznadzor published on Thu 13 Nov 2014 a warning about the high risks of H5N8 and H5N3 virus spreading from China to the territory of Russia, including to the Novosibirsk Region in south west Siberia. The authority demanded that local poultry farms increase control and carry out monitoring laboratory tests for bird flu. See http://en.itar-tass.com/russia/759465.

It would be interesting to note whether any contact between the German and Dutch farms could be traced. In case excluded, a common source, most likely migratory water birds, deserves consideration and study.

So far, no human infections with H5N8 have become known.

We are grateful to Sabine Zentis for drawing attention to the media report. - Mod.AS
