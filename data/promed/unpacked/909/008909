A total of 6 cases of hepatitis A have been reported in Turka Tachloo village of South Kashmir's Anantnag district. A top official said that the cases have been reported in the village, 2 have died and 4 are under observation. He said Turka Tachloo is part of the Anantnag district, however, it falls under the jurisdiction of Kulgam in terms of Health and Jal Shakti blocks. He added both district magistrates of Kulgam and Anantnag are monitoring the situation in the village.

CMO Kulgam, Dr. Rafiq told that during random sampling, 6 cases were confirmed with hepatitis A, which is often a waterborne disease. He said all are students of the same school and the water they were consuming is being evaluated. "The majority of the samples have been found negative while 6 so far are positive; among them, 2 have died and 4 are stable," he said.

[This cluster of hepatitis occurred in students in a single school. The ages of those affected are not stated and it is important to note that hepatitis A infection is exceedingly rare to be fatal in children. The diagnosis is made by finding anti-HAV IgM antibodies in the blood. More information about the cases would be appreciated. - Mod.LL
