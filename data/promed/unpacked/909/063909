[2] WHO situation report 22 Jul 2015 [data to 19 Jul 2015]
Date: Wed 22 Jul 2015
Source: WHO [edited]
http://apps.who.int/ebola/current-situation/ebola-situation-report-22-Jul-2015


There were 26 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) reported in the week to 19 Jul 2015: 22 in Guinea and 4 in Sierra Leone. Liberia reported no new cases. For the 2nd consecutive week, more than half of all cases were reported from the capitals of Guinea and Sierra Leone, Conakry and Freetown. By contrast, other recent hotspots of transmission such as Boke in Guinea and Kambia in Sierra Leone have now reported no cases for 18 and 9 days, respectively. There are also indications of a continuation of the improvements in contact tracing and case investigation seen in recent weeks, with all but 2 cases arising among registered contacts of previous cases, including all 13 of the cases reported from the Guinean capital Conakry. This is the highest proportion of cases to arise among contacts since the beginning of the outbreak. However, one of the 2 cases reported from Freetown arose from an unknown source of infection and is considered to represent a high risk of further transmission. In addition, 2 cases, both from Guinea, were identified as EVD-positive only after post-mortem testing of community deaths.

Guinea
---------
In Guinea, cases were reported from the prefectures of Conakry, Coyah, and Forecariah. 13 cases were reported from Conakry, all of whom were registered contacts associated with 2 chains of transmission; 2 of these cases were health workers. In the neighbouring prefecture of Coyah, 2 cases were reported from the sub-prefecture of Maneah. These are the 1st cases reported from Coyah since April 2015. Both are registered contacts associated with a chain of transmission that stems from the sub-prefecture of Benty in Forecariah; 6 of the 7 cases reported from Forecariah were registered contacts associated with the same chain of transmission in Benty. The remaining case from Forecariah arose from an unknown source in the sub-prefecture of Alassoyah.

Liberia
-------
No new cases were reported from Liberia in the week to 19 Jul 2015. Of the 6 confirmed cases reported since 29 Jun 2015, 2 have died, 2 have been discharged after treatment, and 2 remain under observation in an Ebola Treatment Centre. As of 21 Jul 2015, 56 contacts associated with the chain of transmission are under follow-up. A total of 18 contacts have completed the 21-day follow up period. If there are no further cases, all contacts will have completed follow-up on 2 Aug 2015.

Sierra Leone
------------
The 4 cases confirmed in Sierra Leone were reported from Freetown and Port Loko. The 1st of 2 cases from Freetown was a health worker who tested positive for EVD whilst residing in a voluntary quarantine facility. The 2nd case was found with advanced disease (symptoms including vomiting and diarrhoea) outside a community health facility near the Magazine Wharf neighbourhood of the city, which reported 8 cases in the previous week. However, the case is not a registered contact of any case from the Magazine Wharf transmission chain. Contact tracing has been complicated by the fact that the case has no fixed address and was infectious for an unknown period prior to identification. The remaining 2 cases in Sierra Leone were reported from the chiefdom of Marampa in Port Loko. Both are registered contacts associated with a transmission chain linked to an EVD-positive mother who died during childbirth in mid-June 2015.

Italy
-----
On 20 Jul 2015, Italy was declared free of EVD transmission after the completion of 42 days without a case since the country's 1st and only case of EVD to date was confirmed EVD-negative and discharged from hospital.

Countries with widespread and intense transmission
--------------------------------
There have been a total of 27 705 reported confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone (figure 1, table 1 -- see source) up to 19 Jul 2015, with 11 269 reported deaths (this total includes reported deaths among probable and suspected cases, although outcomes for many cases are unknown). A total of 22 new confirmed cases were reported in Guinea and 4 in Sierra Leone in the week to 19 Jul 2015.

The total number of confirmed cases is similar in males and females (table 2). Compared with children (aged 14 years and under), adults aged 15 to 44 are approximately 4 times more likely to be affected in Guinea and Liberia, and 3 times more likely to be affected in Sierra Leone.

3 new health worker infections were reported in the week to 19 Jul 2015: 2 in Guinea and 1 in Sierra Leone. Since the start of the outbreak, a total of 879 confirmed health worker infections have been reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone; there have been 510 reported deaths (table 5).

21 Jul 2015 IOM (International Organization for Migration) & partners: assess efforts to combat new Ebola cases in Sierra Leone
http://www.iom.int/news/iom-partners-assess-efforts-combat-new-ebola-cases-sierra-leone
[Ebola cases are confined to 3 districts -- Port Loko, Kambia and Western Area Urban, including the capital, yet the past 2 weeks have seen 21 new confirmed cases, with 15 in the low income coastal community of Magazine Wharf, Freetown. One of the biggest challenges of stopping the spread of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) is the high mobility of populations and the cross-border movement of infected travelers.

To address the issue of cross-border collaboration, a team of doctors and public health specialists from IOM's HQ and regional office and the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC)'s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID) arrived in Sierra Leone on 10 Jul 2015 as part of a 2-week long mission to review IOM's health and humanitarian border management (HHBM) programming, including response activities in Magazine Wharf. A UN World Health Organization (WHO) Sierra Leone field team subsequently joined the mission. 15 IOM trainers are now providing support, in partnership with the Ebola Response Consortium. ...more]
