The outbreak in South Australia involves _E. coli_ O157. We have now
had 11 confirmed cases with identical Shiga-toxin gene profiles.
There have been no confirmed cases of [hemolytic uremic syndrome
(HUS)] definitely linked to this outbreak.
Pulsed field gel electrophoresis [PFGE] on 4 of the early isolates
has shown different patterns. However in a large outbreak in 1995
(involving _E. coli_ O111), multiple PFGE patterns were also seen.
Epidemiological investigation is continuing. At this stage no
definite source can be identified, though beef and processed meat
products are not appearing as suspect foods.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Koehler for this up-to-date information. The
hemolytic uremic syndrome case mentioned in ProMED archive
20070125.0328 has not been formally linked to this cluster since the
organism was not isolated from the patient (ProMED archive
20070128.0366). - Mod.LL]
