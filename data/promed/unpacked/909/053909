Laurel filly has equine virus; barn under hold order; other horses checked
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A 2-year-old filly stabled at Laurel Park has tested positive for
equine herpesvirus, the Maryland Department of Agriculture announced
yesterday [13 Nov 2008]. The filly, Nin, trained by King Leatherbury,
was unable to stand Wednesday [12 Nov 2008] but was sitting up and
eating well with no fever yesterday, according to the state
Agriculture Department. Further test results confirming the diagnosis
are pending from the University of Kentucky.

As a result of the presumptive positive test for equine herpesvirus
(EHV-1), Laurel Park's Barn1, where the filly is stabled, is under a
hold order that restricts all movement into and out of the barn,
including for training and racing, pending the results of more
testing. The Agriculture Department took blood samples and nose swabs
of selected horses in the barn that had come from out of state.
Today, more testing will be done on horses near or linked to Nin.
None of the other 29 horses that share Barn1 has shown neurological
signs of the condition.

There are about 800 horses stabled in approximately 3 dozen barns at
Laurel Park. In a best-case scenario in which no other horses are
found to have EHV-1, the hold on Barn1 could be lifted by late next
week, state veterinarian Guy Hohenhaus said. If other horses are
diagnosed with the condition, the timetable would be extended.

"We're confident we have the barn in question under control," Hohenhaus said.

Georganne Hale, racing secretary for the Maryland Jockey Club, said
racetracks in 4 states, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and West
Virginia, were prohibiting horses stabled at Laurel Park or Bowie
Training Center from traveling to those places to race until the
concerns in Maryland were resolved.

The virus causes upper respiratory infection and can cause severe
neurological problems. The condition can be fatal to horses and can
be spread by direct nose to nose contact, contaminated hands,
equipment, food and water, and it can be carried in airborne droplets
through a cough or sneeze up to 35 feet. There is no known human
health risk associated with the virus.

Hohenhaus, in a statement, urged the horse community to maintain
"diligence in continuing strong preventive measures." Those included
keeping new horses separate from the general barn population for at
least one week, disinfecting and keeping vaccinations up to date.

In January 2006, an equine herpesvirus outbreak that started at
Pimlico Race Course and spread to Laurel Park, a farm in Kent County
and the Fair Hill Training Center resulted in 6 horses being
euthanized and 19 others becoming ill. The outbreak started 2 Jan
2006, and the all-clear was sounded about 2 months later in early March.

During that 2-month period, Pimlico was closed for training for 18
days, from 21 Jan through 7 Feb 2006, and 3 days of live racing were
canceled at Laurel Park. Horses were prohibited from traveling from
Maryland to other states.

"Today's news is disappointing but we have already put the proper
precautions into place to control the situation," Hale said in a
statement. "We learned a great deal from 2006 and now know to shut
things down immediately if there is a possible case so as to reduce
the possibility of it spreading. The one advantage to having this
happen in Barn1 is that it is already isolated from much of the backside."

[Equine herpesvirus is also known as rhinopneumonitis and is a viral
disease (EHV-1) caused by a herpesvirus. It may present as a severe
respiratory infection, but it may also cause a neurological disease,
or abortion in pregnant mares. There is a vaccine for it. The
immunity inferred from the disease or the vaccine are relatively
short. Horses on the show or racing circuit are often vaccinated
every 6 months. - Mod.TG]
