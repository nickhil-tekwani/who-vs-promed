PRESS RELEASE
Washington, December 4, 1997. Measles cases imported from Europe and Asia
threaten the progress made in eliminating the disease from the Americas,
and continued vigilance and control are necessary to maintain advances,
according to Dr. Ciro de Quadros, Director of the Special Program for
Vaccines and Immunization of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).
PAHO has launched a plan to eliminate measles from the Western Hemisphere
by the year 2000, and succeeded in cutting cases from some 250,000 in 1990
to just over 18,000 in 1997. Measles cases in the Americas had reached an
all-time low in 1996, when only 2,109 laboratory-confirmed cases were
reported.
But measles virus imported from Europe caused the largest outbreak in
recent years, which began at the end of 1996 in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Of the
18,137 measles cases to date this year in the Hemisphere, 17,216 were
reported from Brazil, and 95% of those were from the city of Sao Paulo,
PAHO figures show. The number is still less than 10% of the cases reported
at the beginning of the decade, de Quadros said.
"This outbreak in Brazil, now under control after an aggressive response by
national, state and municipal authorities, was a wake-up call to the
countries of this Hemisphere," de Quadros said. "But it also proved that
our strategy of high vaccination coverage, careful surveillance, and
follow-up campaigns is correct."
De Quadros, who was a pioneer in the successful campaign to eradicate polio
from the Americas, said "There are two messages here: first, the Americas
must stick with our recommended vaccination strategies, and second, the
rest of the world has to do a better job controlling measles."
Measles, which can be transmitted by droplets or spray from an infected
person, has been a major cause of illness and death in the Western
Hemisphere since it was introduced some 500 years ago by European
explorers. Worldwide, more than one million children die from measles and
its complications each year.
According to December 1997 figures from PAHO, other countries with measles
outbreaks included Canada, with 577 cases; Paraguay, with 124 cases; the
United States with 125 cases; Guadeloupe, 85 cases; Chile, 47 cases;
Argentina, 19 cases, Costa Rica, 11 cases, and Peru, one case. Cases in
Paraguay, Chile, Argentina, Costa Rica and Peru were related to importation
from Brazil, de Quadros said, while the cases in Guadeloupe came from
France. Canada has had no cases in the last three months, and all measles
cases in the U.S. are related to importation, he said.
Measles case surveillance combined with molecular tracing provided by virus
laboratories suggests that at least 23 separate importations of measles
virus came from Europe and 17 from Asia, as well as 2 from Africa. The
European countries that were sources of measles exportation to the Americas
were Italy, Germany, France, Switzerland, Albania and Ukraine. Asian
countries that exported measles to the Americas were China, Philippines,
Japan, Pakistan, Singapore, Tahiti, Tonga and Vietnam, PAHO analyses show.
The lack of a timely follow-up vaccination campaign for children aged 1 to
4, and a deficient vaccination program were responsible for a rapid
accumulation of susceptible children in Sao Paulo, de Quadros said. "Even
in a country with a strong routine immunization program, many vaccinated
children have not yet developed immunity. These children, in addition to
those who escape immunization, will combine to create a large pool of
non-immune or susceptible children, and over time the size of this group
will grow, increasing the risk of a measles outbreak," de Quadros said.
Moreover, the outbreaks in Brazil, Canada and other countries also show
there may be a large number of young adults who have never been exposed to
measles and have not been vaccinated, and remain susceptible to the
disease. "The most important point is that for the Americas to achieve its
goal of measles elimination,increased efforts are needed to eliminate
measles from other parts of the world," de Quadros said.
PAHO, also the regional office of the World Health Organization, works with
all the countries of the Americas, from Baffin Bay in the North to Tierra
del Fuego in the South, to improve the health and raise the living
standards of their peoples.
