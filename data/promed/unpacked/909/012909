It's an outbreak like San Diego has never seen before: there has been a record number of pertussis -- or 'whooping cough' -- cases so far this year [2014]. The illness can turn deadly. It starts as a persistent cough and runny nose followed by weeks of rapid coughing fits. Pertussis is more common in the very young or very old, but if you're not protected, you're not immune.

"Whooping cough is something that's prevented, and your child could die, your parent could die," stated Dr Lila Schmidt.

The numbers are staggering -- record-breaking, in fact. There have been 1183 cases of pertussis or whooping cough in San Diego County so far this year [2014]. Last year, there was a total of 431 cases. Although the very contagious respiratory bacteria peaks every 3 to 4 years, this is shocking public health officials.

So what can you do to protect your family? Get vaccinated, says Dr Schmidt, especially if you're pregnant.

"It's a series of 5 -- not just one and good to go. It's starts at a couple months old; by the time you are 5, you are finished with the series. Kids in the old days were okay, but now, a lot of parents opt out of vaccinations."

Dr Schmidt says now is not the time to avoid having your child get shots as whooping coughs whip through the county. It's risk versus reward, she says. To prevent the spread of the bacteria, wash your hands with soap and hot water. Use hot towels to dry your hands, avoid hand sanitizers and those air-dry machines. If you are healthier, your chances of getting a disease -- even if you're exposed -- go down.

"I would get vaccinated and do the basics mom taught you: wash your hands, get enough sleep, eat vegetables, drink water, and if someone is sick, stay away from them."

They sound like simple reminders, but wash your hands before you eat, use your knuckle to call for the elevator, cough into your elbow. Just be smart so you don't get sick. If you have questions about getting immunized, go to http://sdiz.org.

[The number of cases of pertussis in San Diego County, California has increased by 288 cases since the last ProMED-mail report (Pertussis - USA (14): (CA) increased incidence, update 20140720.2623332) less than 1 month ago.

Pertussis has been on the increase throughout most of the world. This has been attributed in part to increased virulence and other genetic changes in the circulating clones of _Bordetella pertussis_, as well as waning or an ineffective immune response after vaccination. For a discussion of these problems, see moderator LL's comments in prior ProMED-mail posts on pertussis and moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post Pertussis - USA (04): (MT, CA) increased incidence, archive number: 20140424.2426383. - Mod.ML
