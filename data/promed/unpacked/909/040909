Another polio case has been reported in Balochistan, taking the tally of the cases for the current year [2020] to 25 in the province, ARY News reported.

The provincial health department has confirmed that a 16-month-old boy in Qila Abdullah area of the province tested positive for the virus. With the latest inclusion, the overall number of poliovirus cases in Balochistan has jumped to 25. Earlier on [25 Sep 2020], a polio case had been reported in Ahmedpur East tehsil in Punjab's Bahawalpur district.

Polio is a highly infectious disease caused by poliovirus, mainly affecting children under the age of 5. It invades the nervous system and can cause paralysis or even death. While there is no cure for polio, vaccination is the most effective way to protect children from this crippling disease. Repeated immunizations have protected millions of children from polio across the world, allowing almost all countries to become polio-free.

There are only 2 countries in the world, Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan, where polio cases are still being reported.

[The latest case brings the total number of polio cases to 83 in 2020; 25 in Balochistan, 22 each in Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and 14 in Punjab. The latest case has not yet been added to the province-wide number of polio cases (https://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-in-provinces). 83 circulating vaccine derived polio virus 2 (cVDPV2) cases have also been detected across Pakistan so far in 2020.

[Our thanks to Mod.SN from ProMED-SoAs (our South Asia Regional Network) for spotting this alert 1st (see ProMED-SoAs: Poliomyelitis (33): Pakistan (Balochistan) 20201220.8033243). In the past week's Global Polio Eradication Initiative update, while Pakistan had not reported any wild poliovirus (WPV1) cases, there had been positive environmental samples, 2 in Balochistan province and one in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a sign that the virus was circulating in both provinces (see Poliomyelitis update (21): global, Sierra Leone, RFI 20201217.8026377).

The location of this case -- Killa Abdullah -- borders Afghanistan and is in the known WPV1 corridor ongoing for the past several years (see https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/pak215_pakistan_districts_v5_a0_20181203.pdf for a map of Pakistan showing districts and provinces). - Mod.MPP
