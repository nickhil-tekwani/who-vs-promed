Mystery disease claims 15 lives
A mysterious disease has killed 15 people in the Tana River District in
Kenya. The Tana River Medical Officer, Dr. Dave Muthama, confirmed the
deaths and said the victims died several hours after contracting the
disease. The symptoms include vomiting, diarrhoea and bleeding from body
orifices, he said.
Civic leaders told journalists they feared the disease could claim more
lives as the area lacked health facilities.
Muthama said his office was [serving as a liaison with doctors from
Garissa provincial hospital, 200km away, in an effort to obtain more drugs
and personnel. An advance medical team has been dispatched to the area to
help contain the disease.
Muthama said his team has not yet established the nature of the disease. He
advised residents in the affected area to observe high standards of hygiene
to prevent it spreading further.
Medical sources at Garissa provincial hospital said the disease's symptoms
are similar to those of Rift Valley fever which claimed more than 2,000
lives in North Eastern Province in early 1998.

[Other possibilities include yellow fever, Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever
and, of course, Ebola fever -- although Ebola has not so far been reported
in East Africa south of the Sudan. Readers on HealthNet Kenya, please keep
