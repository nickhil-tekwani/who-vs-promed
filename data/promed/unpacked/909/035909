As of Mon 30 Oct 2017, there have been a total of:
1730 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
699 deaths [reported case fatality rate 40.4 percent],
1014 recoveries, and
14 currently active cases/infections.

[As previously mentioned, the numbers of deaths, recoveries, and currently active cases come from my spreadsheet tallies and differ from those listed on the Saudi MOH website; my spreadsheet counts asymptomatic infections as they are reported. One complication is the reporting of cases as either recoveries or deaths that cannot be confirmed as previously reported newly confirmed cases. - Mod.MPP]

Since the last ProMED-mail update [17 Oct 2017], there have been a total of:
4 newly confirmed cases,
0 newly reported fatality, and
1 newly reported recovery.

[As of today, 30 Oct 2017 there have been a total of 1730 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia since September 2012, including 699 deaths (reported case fatality rate of 40.4 percent). During the month of October 2017 (through today - 30 Oct 2017), there were 9 newly confirmed cases/infections and 3 fatalities reported compared to September 2017 when there were 11 newly confirmed cases/infections and 7 fatalities reported, and August 2017 when there were 33 newly confirmed cases/infection and 8 fatalities reported.

The major increase in reported cases/infections in the month of August 2017 was in part due to a nosocomial outbreak in Dawmat Aljandal, Al Jawf region involving 20 cases/infection of which 13 were asymptomatic infections detected during screening of all known contacts of laboratory confirmed cases. One of the cases/infections reported in September was also related to the August 2017 outbreak.

The 9 newly confirmed cases during the month of October 2017 involved all primary cases, 7 of whom had a history of direct or indirect contact with camels prior to onset of their illnesses and 2 of whom died.

[2] South Korea, post disease sequelae

Most of the Korean patients infected with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2015 have not fully recovered from physical or psychological traumas, a recent cohort study showed. At the time, the nationwide outbreak had 186 people infected and claimed 38 lives.

The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences unveiled the cohort study on MERS patients at the Seoul National University Cancer Hospital on [Thu 26 Oct 2017]. The 2-year observation study from November 2015 to October 2017 checked lung functions and mental health of 72 MERS patients out of the 148 survivors. A total of 5 hospitals participated in the study -- the National Medical Center, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul Medical Center, Dankook University Hospital and Chungnam National University Hospital. [The Ministry of Health and Welfare supported the 2-year observation study.]

The study showed that MERS patients saw their walking ability improved, but their lung functions worsened. "Those who had severer pneumonia showed poorer lung functions in one year since the outbreak. After 2 years, their lung functions slightly worsened," said Shin Hyoung-shik, head of the NMC's infectious disease research center, presenting a clinical assessment of the study. "Their walking ability for 6 minutes was a bit weaker than ordinary people in 1 year since the outbreak but went back to the normal level in 2 years."

Shin noted that 53 percent of MERS patients' lungs showed fibrosis in computerized tomography (CT) scans on the chest, which was the most common symptom among the MERS patients. However, such problem almost disappeared after 2 years.

"With magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans on their brains, we could also learn that white matter abnormalities were most commonly observed, with 33 percent of the patients showing such problem. In the positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT), inflammatory lesions in the lung were the most common, with 40 percent of them showing such issues," he said.

About 54 percent of the MERS patients suffered from depression or chronic fatigue syndrome. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) appeared as the most frequently reported problem with 27 percent of them having it, followed by depression and sleep disorder with 15 percent, respectively. Another 5.8 percent said they had an anxiety disorder. Nearly 2 percent of the patients were those with a high risk of attempting suicide. More than one third, or 36.5 percent, suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome.

The MERS victims who suffered from such physical and psychological disorders saw their symptoms abate during the 1st year of observation. However, their inclination to attempt suicide or excessive alcohol intake did not show any improvement.

Lee So-hee, head of the Psychiatry Department of the NMC, who presented the assessment result of mental health of the MERS patients, said the MERS survivors are still suffering from the trauma, although 2 years have passed since the outbreak.

"We need to continuously observe the survivors' mental health and support treatments for those in the high-risk group," she said. "In case of an outbreak of a new epidemic, the authorities should guide mental health for the general public, the self-quarantined, physicians, and the infected patients. They should also provide mental health consultation service."

[I was unable to find a link to a published journal article with the above findings. I suspect it will follow in due time. What is interesting, though not surprising, are the parallels to what was seen in the post-SARS (Severe acute respiratory syndrome) patients. The literature has numerous articles addressing the psychological impact of SARS, with a prominent occurrence of PTSD and depression (see refs. 1-4). Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, depression and sleep disturbances have been documented (see ref. 5). Residual pulmonary fibrosis has also been described (ref.6).

It will be interesting to read the full studies described in the Korea BioMedical Review article on these long term sequelae associated with MERS-CoV infection.
