A poliomyelitis case, the 1st one in the past 30 years, has been
registered in Russia's Far Eastern Khabarovsk Territory, the head of
the territorial consumer rights supervision authority told Itar-Tass
on Wednesday [21 Jul 2010].

According to Vladimir Ott, the disease was diagnosed in a 5-month
[old] baby girl from a Central Asian family. The family arrived in
Khabarovsk at the invitation of the girl's mother. The woman, born in
Uzbekistan, has been residing in Khabarovsk for the past couple of
years. The whole family, numbering 20 adults and children, was
accommodated in a small flat.

The girl was hospitalised and medics say she is in condition of
moderate gravity. Meanwhile, local health authorities take measures
to find out all those who had contact with the child. "A total of 28
persons have already been inoculated, although laboratory tests are
not yet ready," Ott said.

"Only after final results are received we will be able to say that
the infection is contained," he added.

Medics are sure it is an introduced polio case.

A Moscow laboratory confirmed the diagnosis of polio in a child of an
Uzbekistan migrant living in Khabarovsk.

In early July 2010, a 6-month old baby was hospitalized in a
children's infectious diseases hospital. The doctors suspected polio.
Specimens from the child were sent to a laboratory in Moscow for
analysis.

The representative of the Khabarovsk Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service
for Consumer Affairs and Human Welfare], said that the specialists of
the Moscow laboratory confirmed infection with poliovirus. The
laboratory was also sent specimens from 28 contacts of the child.

The Rospotrebnadzor employee noted that all of the child's contacts
were examined by doctors and were vaccinated against polio. According
to sources, there have not been any cases of polio recorded in the
region for over 30 years.

In April 2010 an outbreak of polio was registered in Tajikistan. The
country has identified over 600 patients with suspected polio, and
274 cases of polio confirmed by laboratory tests. Now, thanks to
several stages of immunization, the epidemiological situation in
Tajikistan has stabilized. According to the World Health
Organization, no new cases of infection with poliovirus have been
registered in the republic since [12 Jun 2010].

In Russia there were 7 reported cases of polio among immigrants from
countries of Central Asia, including one with a fatal outcome. In
addition, Russian doctors have identified 10 cases of asymptomatic
carriers of poliovirus.

[In another Russian language newswire report there was mention that
the original case report was of a 5-month-old girl, but in fact, the
case was a 6-month-old boy. This additional newswire seemed to
suggest there was a 10-year-old asymptomatic carrier of the wild
poliovirus (WPV) identified in Khabarovsk, perhaps among the 28
identified contacts of the paralytic case. The newswire also
mentioned that the 6-month-old boy with clinical polio was born in
Russia but had not been vaccinated, and there were visitors from
Uzbekistan staying with the affected child's family (see
<http://www.rosbalt.ru/2010/07/22/755962.html>).

According to the polio eradication website, as of Tue 20 Jul 2010,
there have been 425 confirmed cases of polio reported in Tajikistan,
with the most recent date of onset 12 Jun 2010. Of note, according to
this report, there are no confirmed cases of WPV associated polio in
Russia or Uzbekistan reported to WHO as of 20 Jul 2010 (see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp>). (Note that there
have been prior reports of cases in Russia posted on ProMED-mail:

respect to WPV associated polio in Russia and Uzbekistan from
knowledgeable sources in the region would be greatly appreciated.
