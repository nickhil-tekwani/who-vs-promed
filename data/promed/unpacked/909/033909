On Wednesday [4 Nov 2015], the Mozambican health authorities said that the contaminated beer called "pombe" killed 75, instead of intentional poisoning, in the Chitima district in Tete province (North West) this past January [2015]. The test results, made in the United States, were published on Wednesday in Maputo by the Mozambican Ministry of Health.

According to the authorities in Chitima, 265 people drank pombe, a traditional beer made with corn flour. The tests show the existence of powerful toxic acids in the beer. Authorities said that the flour that contained deteriorated bacteria, called _Burkholderia gladioli_, was to blame for toxins in the drink.

Among the dead were the maker of the drink and her daughter. Police arrested a man suspected of having poisoned the drink but released him later for lack of evidence. "The cases and deaths that occurred in Chitima resulted from poisoning," said the director of the National Health Institute, Ilesh Jani. People drink pombe during traditional ceremonies throughout Mozambique.

[Pombe is generally a beer made from millet. Millet is a grain. Pombe may also refer to the rapid proliferation of the specific yeast used in the beer.

The genus _Burkholderia_ was formerly classified as the genus _Pseudomonas_.

_Burkholderia gladioli_ is primarily known as a plant pathogen. _B. gladioli_ was 1st identified as a plant pathogen in gladiolus, iris and rice, but this bacterium is found in diverse environments including soil, plants and the human respiratory tract. Its pathogenesis in humans was 1st described in the mid-1990s in case reports of cystic fibrosis and chronic granulomatous disease, and the majority of the reported _B. gladioli_ infections have been in immunocompromised adults.

So if this rapid proliferation of yeast had some effect in allowing the bacteria to rapidly proliferate, it still seems a bit odd that it would kill them. It seems more likely they would have developed lung issues. But there may be more to the local brew than we are able to determine. - Mod.TG
