World Health Organisation States Ebola Fever Outbreak Effectively Over
----------------------------------------------------------------------
KAMPALA: The World Health Organization (WHO) said yesterday that the
epidemic of Ebola fever, which has killed 173 people, is now effectively
over. No new cases have been reported in the last 21 days, the maximum
incubation period for the disease. "We have to wait for 42 days, twice the
maximum incubation period, before we can officially give the all-clear," Dr
Oladapo Walker, the WHO Country Representative in Uganda, said. "But it is
over as far as we are concerned," he told Reuters. Health ministry
officials yesterday said no more Ebola fever patients were expected. But
they said they would wait another 21 days before Uganda is declared Ebola-free.
Ebola Task Force chief Dr Sam Okware said all people who had contact with
Ebola patients had been followed up for 3 weeks. He said the public should
remain vigilant. The last case was a woman who fell ill on 11 Jan 2001
after caring for her grandchild, who died of Ebola fever. She was cleared
of virus infection on 16 Jan 2001. Okware said, "We have no case and no
contact anywhere in the country. The whole incubation period is over but
you never know. We shall wait for another 21 days to be absolutely sure.
Surveillance is still on. We shall make a final declaration at the end of
42 days."
The last remaining staff member from WHO's Geneva headquarters was due to
leave Uganda yesterday, although health workers would keep watch on those
known to have been in close contact with Ebola fever patients in the
northern town of Gulu until late February, Walker said. A total of 428
people suffered from the disease. Okware said the Ebola Task Force would
redirect its efforts towards rehabilitation and re-integration of survivors
and their families as well as care for orphans.
Ebola, first recognized in 1976 in Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, has no known cure. Most of its victims die from shock after days
of high fever, vomiting, and extensive bleeding. In past outbreaks among
humans, Ebola has killed between 50 per cent and 90 per cent of its
victims. Okware, however, said the rapid and effective response by health
workers might have meant a lower mortality rate during the Ugandan epidemic.
