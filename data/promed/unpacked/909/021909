Bubonic Plague Kills 11 People in Zambia
----------------------------------------
The deadly bubonic plague has claimed 11 lives in the last one week in
Petauke, Eastern Zambia, where another 30 patients are fighting for their
lives, according to health officials.
Health Minister Enoch Kavindele said Wednesday that health experts have
brought some tissues for testing at the University Teaching Hospital
laboratory in Lusaka. The Central Board of Health (CBoH), which has
confirmed the outbreak, said it had already dispatched a team of experts to
the area.
CBoH spokesman Ben Chirwa said Tuesday that the strain of the disease in
Petauke is the type that manifests in the blood stream and results in
fatality if not treated immediately. The symptoms of the disease, which
kills within 3 days, include swollen glands and high fever.
[Bubonic plague was first reported Zambia's western Zambezi in 1936. The
most serious outbreak was in 1997 in Namwala, where it claimed more than 25
lives.

Zambia: Outbreak of bubonic plague reportedly spreading
-------------------------------------------------------
Seven more people have died from bubonic plague at the Nyanje Mission
Hospital in Petauke in the last few days, bringing the total death toll to
18 as the disease has now spread to Sinda. The number of admissions at the
Nyanje hospital has also swelled to 44.
Hospital administrator Jack Phiri confirmed the development yesterday but
could not however give details on how many cases were referred to the
hospital from Sinda. He said patients at the hospital were responding to
treatment and that some would be discharged soon.

Director general of the Central Board of Health (CBoH) Gavin Silwamba said
of those admitted, 9 children were below the age of 9 years, 31 were aged
above 5 years. Fifty-eight patients had so far been treated.

Dr Silwamba said specimens sent to the UTH confirmed the presence of
_Yersinia pestis_ the causative agent of the plague.

He appealed to people in the affected areas not to touch dead rats with
their bare hands, block holes in houses, kill as many rats and reduce their
population, then bury or burn them and seek medical attention quickly.

[Although the comment in [1 concerning strain characteristics is somewhat
cryptic, it may be referring to _Yersinia pestis_ strains that express V
and W antigens. Expression of these proteins is controlled by plasmid genes
and they are two of a number of virulence factors that have been correlated
with rapid proliferation and overwhelming sepsis. Further information about
the isolates would be appreciated. - Mod.ES
