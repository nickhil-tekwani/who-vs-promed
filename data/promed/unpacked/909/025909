Health Officials Fear New Spread of Polio
-----------------------
Polio apparently reached Mecca, Islam's holy city, just before last
month's annual pilgrimage by 2 million Muslims, and World Health
Organization officials now fear that it could be spreading around the
world, carried by returning pilgrims.
In crowded nations with spotty vaccination coverage, like Bangladesh
and Indonesia, "there could be substantial consequences," Dr. Bruce
Aylward, coordinator of the W.H.O.'s Global Polio Eradication
Initiative in Geneva, said in an interview.
"This is a crucial point," he added. "We're staring at the whites of
the eyes of this thing."
A Saudi government spokesman said his country had feared the arrival
of polio this year because it was known to be spreading across
Africa. The Saudis started a sweeping polio inoculation campaign in
September [2004], hoping to head off the threat before the height of
the hajj, or pilgrimage, in late January [2005].
Saudi Arabia had been polio-free since 1995, but 2 cases were found
there late last year. The first, confirmed in late December, was in
the port city of Jeddah in a girl who became paralyzed on 6 Nov
[2004], just after arriving from Sudan. The 2nd, more worrisome case,
became known today, Dr. Aylward said. It was discovered in a
5-year-old Nigerian boy who developed paralysis on 15 Dec [2004].
What made it more troubling was that his family had lived for several
years in an illegal encampment on the outskirts of Mecca, so he must
have caught it in Saudi Arabia.
Spotting new outbreaks in far-flung countries will still take weeks,
experts said. Paralysis affects only about 1 in 200 carriers of the
virus, symptoms can take up to 35 days to emerge, pilgrims traveling
by bus or boat can take weeks to get home, and epidemiological
reporting in poor countries is often slipshod.
"You want to be well into March before you breathe a sigh of relief,"
Dr. Aylward said.
The virus lives in the intestine and spreads through fecal-oral
contact, so anything from changing a diaper to sharing a food dish or
swimming in contaminated water can transmit it. Polio vaccination was
not required for hajj pilgrims because it was a rapidly diminishing
threat until this year. Even if it was required, thousands of
pilgrims arrive illegally, and many legal visitors carry forged
immunization records, said the government spokesman, Nail al-Jubeir
of the Saudi Embassy in Washington.
"We have to trust the health services of the countries they come
from," he said. "We can't give everyone blood tests."
Polio has been spreading from northern Nigeria since 2003, when
vaccination campaigns there were halted for months after Muslim imams
and local politicians spread rumors that the vaccine could make women
sterile, transmit AIDS or was made with pork products.
Most cases related to that outbreak have been in the largely Muslim
Sahel, the band of arid but arable land south of the Sahara Desert
stretching from Mali to Ethiopia.
The remaining pockets elsewhere are also mostly in Muslim areas:
Pakistan, northern India, Afghanistan and Egypt.
In September [2004], Saudi Arabia began vaccinating 800 000 people in
Mecca and in the Jeddah area, where pilgrims disembark.
Each case of paralysis implies that many more virus-carriers are
nearby. Most victims suffer symptoms no more serious than those of
flu, but even people with no symptoms can pass the virus.
In 1988, when polio was endemic in 125 countries, the annual assembly
of the health ministers of all nations in Geneva declared their
intent to eradicate it by the year 2000. That target was missed, but
USD $3 billion in vaccination campaigns drove the disease back until
it existed in only 6 countries by the end of 2003: Nigeria, India,
Pakistan, Niger, Egypt and Afghanistan.
But in 2002, Muslims in large swaths of Nigeria and Niger began
resisting vaccination. The reasons were complex: religious and
political rivalries, a failed drug trial, and reports of the
controversial 1999 book "The River," which linked AIDS to polio
vaccinations in the Congo in the 1950's.
The World Health Organization, UNICEF [United Nations Children's
Fund], Rotary International and other groups fighting polio began
intensive lobbying of local Nigerian officials, as did senior Islamic
clerics from other countries.
It took until last year to persuade the governor of Nigeria's Kano
State, one of the loudest critics of the vaccine, to accept it as
long as it was imported from a Muslim country. He inaugurated a new
vaccination drive in October [2004] by allowing Nigeria's president,
Olusegun Obasanjo, to give his daughter drops of a vaccine made in
Indonesia.
But by that time, the virus had escaped. Last year, paralysis cases
appeared as far west as Mali and as far south as Botswana. Genetic
testing identified them as a strain from Nigeria.
"In most of them, we were able to surround it and stop it from
transmitting locally," said Dr. David L. Heymann, representative for
polio eradication of the W.H.O. secretary-general.
The most persistent migration was to the east, with cases spreading
along the Sahel's highways. Sudan, which had been polio-free for 3
years, found a case imported from Chad in May 2004, and by late
January [2005] had 112 cases, most of them in Darfur, on the Chad
border, around the capital, Khartoum, and in the state bordering the
Red Sea.
Some Sudanese officials suggested that it had been spread by refugees
fleeing fighting in southern Sudan, and a polio expert at the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta recently offered that
explanation.
But Dr. Aylward said it "didn't make any sense" because the Khartoum
refugee camps had existed for years and cases were exploding in Port
Sudan, the jumping off point for Mecca.
"Tens of thousands of pilgrims pile up in Port Sudan, and they can be
there for weeks or months," he said.
Another urgent worry of his, he said, was that the hundreds of
truckers from landlocked Ethiopia who use Port Sudan could carry
polio back home, where immunization rates are low.
Mr. Al-Jubeir said Saudi Arabia hires thousands of extra doctors for
the hajj season, who watch for signs of disease among the millions
entering through special airport and boat terminals set aside for
pilgrims.
However, he said, they cannot spot someone with no symptoms, and many
people carry vaccination records that were stamped in return for
bribes in their home countries.
Also, he said, the Saudi border police have caught as many as 52 000
people a month sneaking into the country, mostly from Africa, through
Yemen.
"It's a nightmare," he said.
During the hajj, vast crowds circle the Grand Mosque and stone the
pillars of Satan while pressed so closely together that, in some
years, many have died in the crush. Hundreds of thousands live in
government-inspected tent cities, but thousands camp illegally in the
mountains around Mecca with no health or sanitation facilities.
"Before terrorism, our biggest concern was disease," Mr. al-Jubeir said.
The 2000 hajj saw a serious outbreak of meningococcal meningitis.
Now, pilgrims are supposed to show proof of vaccination against it
before they board planes at home, and those from countries where
meningitis is common are required to swallow an antibiotic upon
arrival.
This year the Saudis required those vaccinations and, for pilgrims
from certain countries, yellow fever.
Most Muslims who fly to Saudi Arabia each year do not normally bring
their children, Dr. Aylward said, since the hajj is an obligation of
adults and involves long treks under the desert sun. But pilgrims
from Africa too poor to fly may have no choice.

[The above article is very complete in its discussion on the possible
implications of poliovirus circulation in Mecca during the time of
the haj. As mentioned above, there was an outbreak of meningococcal
meningitis W135 that occurred during the haj with multiple
importations to countries of origin of haj attendees (see references
below). The concern above is that there was presumptive evidence of
circulation of the wild poliovirus in Saudi Arabia as the 2nd
reported case did not have a history of travel preceding the onset of
illness and therefore was infected in Saudi Arabia. We do not know
if there was direct contact with travellers from known endemic areas.
We await further information on the investigation of this case as
well as possible additional cases that may have been related to
contact with returnees from the haj. - Mod.MPP]
