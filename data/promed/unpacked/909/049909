Late blight [is] infesting potato tubers in [areas of] Chukha [District]. Farmers may not be able to harvest potato like last year [2016]. Potato is the main cash crop [and] almost all the households are affected. [A farmer] said, "It started early in March [2017] and it is affecting the growth of the crop." He said the potato growers are worried. [An official] said the disease is spreading.

Chukha agriculture officer Sonam said this is not the 1st time the disease infested potatoes in the locality. "But it affected during harvest time in past years." He said 'late blight' has affected the tuber early this year [2017] and caused severe damages. "Spraying fungicides is not an option for farmers." [He] said intermittent rainfall is a factor in spreading the disease.

Meanwhile, the agriculture team and experts from the national potato programme has assessed the affected fields. "We will discuss intervention and way forward once the report is finalised," Sonam said.

[Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus-like organism (oomycete) _Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 per cent crop loss. The pathogen can also affect tomato and some other solanaceous crops. In potato, it affects leaves as well as tubers; in tomato, it causes lesions and rotting of leaves, stems and fruits. The disease is favoured by cool, moist conditions. It can spread rapidly within a crop and destroy it within a few days. Under favourable conditions, epidemics in tomatoes may be even more rapid than in potatoes.

PLB is spread by plant material (including plant debris and volunteer crop plants), mechanical means (including human and insect activities), wind and water. Disease management requires an integrated approach and may include removal of pathogen reservoirs, crop rotation, preventive fungicide treatments of planting material and fungicide sprays of crops.

Late blight is considered an increasing problem worldwide. More virulent strains with additional fungicide resistances and increased yield losses are emerging frequently. Farm saved or uncertified seed tubers have often been reported as sources of PLB outbreaks in the past. Thus, seed tuber certification schemes have been set up in many countries. Development of resistant cultivars is being counteracted by the adaptability of the pathogen. Clean planting stock (potato seed tubers; tomato seeds or explants) and management strategies for fungicide resistance of the pathogen are considered vital to control PLB in the future.

Elsewhere in the region, current outbreaks of PLB are reported in Bangladesh (ProMED-mail posts 20170209.4825828 and 20170115.4767829).
