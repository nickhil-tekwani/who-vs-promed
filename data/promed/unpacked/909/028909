On [22 Dec 2020], a nasopharyngeal swab was submitted to a local laboratory for testing of SARS-CoV-2 from an adult-aged individual who had recently arrived in Alberta, Canada from the United Kingdom several days prior to the Canadian government announcing suspension of flights from the United Kingdom [1]. The individual was tested due to development of symptoms within 48 hours of arrival in Alberta and while undergoing a 14-day quarantine due to current Government of Canada regulations [2].

SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected using a validated laboratory-developed real-time RT-PCR assay targeting regions of the envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) genes on the Roche Cobas z480/LC480 system (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). A combination of Sanger sequencing and whole genome sequencing confirmed 16 key mutations including S:N501Y (A23063T) and S:HV 69-70 deletion (nucleotide 21765-21770 deletion). This confirmed the genome to be a Variant of Concern 202012/01 (lineage B.1.1.7), which has recently been reported from the United Kingdom on [21 Dec 2020] [3,4]. This is the 4th case of the SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 reported from Canada [5,6].

At the time of diagnosis and detection, the patient was experiencing mild symptoms consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection and isolating at home.

Contact tracing by local public health authorities identified all potential primary contacts; they were advised to isolate for a minimum 14-day period from the time of last contact with the identified case. Instructions for them to contact public health prior to getting tested in the event they develop symptoms were provided.

[B] USA: Colorado

https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/coronavirus-variant-colorado-us/2020/12/29/8e6379fc-4a01-11eb-a9f4-0e668b9772ba_story.html


Colorado officials on Tuesday [29 Dec 2020] reported the 1st known case in the United States of a person infected with the coronavirus variant that has been circulating rapidly across much of the United Kingdom and has led to a lockdown of much of southern England. Scientists have said the variant is more transmissible but does not make people sicker.

The Colorado case involves a man in his 20s, who is in isolation in Elbert County, about 50 miles [80 km] south east of Denver, and has no travel history, according to a tweet from the office of Governor Jared Polis. "The individual has no close contacts identified so far but public health officials are working to identify other potential cases and contacts through thorough contact tracing interviews," the statement said.

A federal scientist familiar with the investigation said the man's lack of known travel -- in contrast with most confirmed cases outside the United Kingdom -- indicates this is probably not an isolated case. "We can expect that it will be detected elsewhere," said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the broader context of the announcement. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed as much in a statement on Tuesday afternoon [29 Dec 2020], saying additional cases with the new variant will be detected in the United States in coming days. The variant's apparent increase in contagiousness "could lead to more cases and place greater demand on already strained health care resources," the agency said in a statement.

Researchers have detected the more transmissible variant in at least 17 countries outside the United Kingdom, including as far away as Australia and South Korea, as of Tuesday afternoon [29 Dec 2020]. Officials in Canada had previously said they had identified 2 cases [see section [A] above].

Although the UK variant appears more contagious, it is not leading to higher rates of hospitalizations or deaths, according to a report from Public Health England, a government agency. Nor is there any sign that people who were infected months ago with the coronavirus are more likely to be reinfected if exposed to the variant, according to the report. All available evidence indicates that vaccines, and immunity built up in the population, should be protective against this variant.

The Colorado case occurred in a county of about 27 000, which is currently classified, along with much of the state, in the "red" level for the virus, denoting serious but not extreme risk. 2 weeks ago, several hundred people gathered at a community church in the county seat of Kiowa to consider whether to pursue legal actions against Polis and other state officials for imposing coronavirus-related restrictions, according to the Elbert County News. County commissioners and the county sheriff have declined to enforce restrictions emanating from Denver. [Welcome to the USA approach to the pandemic...]

"I was expecting to see it in ski country first because those areas are where people from across Colorado, the US, and internationally, gather," said Elizabeth Carlton, an assistant professor of environmental and occupational health at the Colorado School of Public Health. The absence of any apparent travel history associated with the infected person, she said, suggests he "can't be the only case in Colorado." [and probably not the only case in the rest of the USA. - Mod.MPP]

Polis, in his statement, called on Coloradans to do everything they could to prevent transmission by wearing masks, standing 6 feet [2 m] apart when gathering with others, and interacting only with members of their immediate households.

The arrival of the new variant "doesn't fundamentally change the nature of the threat", said Justin Lessler, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health: "It's no more deadly than the virus was before, and it doesn't look like it infects people who are immune." Lessler echoed others, saying he would be "astounded" if this was the only chain of transmission of the new variant in the United States. "We know that the virus spreads easily and quickly between countries," he said, and the fact that the infected person had no travel history indicates "this strain has gotten here sometime in the past, and there are chains of transmission ongoing."

The variant has a higher attack rate, according to the UK report, which bolsters the hypothesis that the variant has out-competed other versions of the coronavirus and is now the dominant variant across much of the United Kingdom. Among people known to have been exposed to someone already infected with the variant, 15.1 per cent became infected. People exposed to someone infected with the non-variant version had a 9.8 per cent infection rate. That difference suggests the variant is more transmissible, though Public Health England said more investigation is needed to bolster the hypothesis.

The working theory among many scientists is that the increased transmissibility of the variant, known as B.1.1.7, is driven by mutations that have altered the spike protein on the surface of the virus. The variant has 17 mutations -- 8 of which alter the spike protein. Precisely how those changes are leading to more infections is unknown. The virus may be binding more easily to receptor cells in the human body, or replicating more easily and driving higher viral loads, enhancing viral shedding by someone who is infected. Another possibility is that people are shedding the virus for a longer period, increasing the chances of passing it along.

"Preliminary evidence suggests that the new variant does not cause more severe disease or increased mortality," Susan Hopkins, a senior medical adviser to Public Health England, said in a statement released on Tuesday [29 Dec 2020].

The newly published data echo the findings in a separate study published last week [from the Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, Davies N, Barnard RC, Jarvis CI, et al. Estimated transmissibility and severity of novel SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern 202012/01 in England. First online 23 Dec 2020. https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/uk-novel-variant.html], based on modeling and hospitalization data -- and not yet peer-reviewed -- that estimated that the variant is 56 per cent more transmissible but does not appear to alter the lethality of the virus.

"The good news is that B.1.1.7 does not seem to cause much more severe disease, and there's no evidence that it is managing to evade the immune system, which means vaccines are expected to protect against it," William Hanage, an epidemiologists at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, said on Tuesday [29 Dec 2020] after reviewing the new report. "The bad news is that B.1.1.7 does appear to be much more transmissible."

Officials in the United States have been signaling since last week that the new variant was probably already present in this country. "I'm not surprised," Anthony S Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Tuesday [29 Dec 2020]. "I think we have to keep an eye on it, and we have to take it seriously. We obviously take any kind of mutation that might have a functional significance seriously. But I don't think we know enough about it to make any definitive statements, except to follow it carefully and study it carefully."

Research findings on coronavirus variants have been ambiguous at times, and scientists say they are still trying to extract reliable signals from noisy data. There have been several false alarms sounded about virus mutations in the past. A major challenge is discerning whether a virus variant is spreading rapidly because it has a competitive advantage based on genetic and structural differences, or because it is simply lucky, having arrived early to a location or leveraged a few superspreader events to gain dominance.

But with the United Kingdom seeing a severe winter surge of infections, public officials are taking no chances and have effectively locked down southern England, including London. Other countries have banned travelers from the United Kingdom.

The United States, despite having the world's highest number of documented infections, has a weak track record in publishing genomic sequences, the process that enables researchers to track changes in the virus. Most sequences have been published by academic or private research institutions. By comparison, the United Kingdom has a national health system with a robust surveillance system. "The UK made the decision in the spring to do this. The US has sequencing equipment and infrastructure. As with many things in this pandemic, it was not executed the way it should have been," said Neville Sanjana, a geneticist at New York University.

All viruses mutate randomly, and over time some of those mutations appear to confer some kind of advantage to the virus as it adapts to the human species. The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, mutates at a slow rate, and scientists do not think the genetic changes seen in the variant so far are sufficient to allow it to elude the vaccines now being administered to millions of people in many countries. But the coronavirus is a moving target and these mutations require surveillance.

Francois Balloux, who directs the Genetics Institute at University College London, on Twitter predicted that within 2 weeks, enough data will accumulate to determine whether this new variant is indeed more transmissible. Previously, Balloux and his colleagues combed through genome sequences, looking for evidence that common variants had increased transmissibility. "We don't see much," he said, referring to a report published in the journal Nature in November [2020] that found no signs of mutations that helped the virus to spread more easily [see van Dorp L, Richard D, Tan CCS, et al. No evidence for increased transmissibility from recurrent mutations in SARS-CoV-2. Nat Commun. 2020 Nov 25; 11(1): 5986. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-19818-2; https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19818-2]. However, he said he "wouldn't underestimate the evolutionary potential of SARS-CoV-2."

[I aimed to abridge this media report but found there was too much there to explain significance (known and unknown) of the mutations, and the realities of what the USA is facing with respect to adherence to NPIs (nonpharmaceutical interventions) and the probable major impact this is having on transmission. There have been media reports from other countries in Europe suggesting the USA is not alone in having pockets of population rejecting NPIs. When Austria mandated a 10-day quarantine for non-Austrians at ski resorts, overnight an indetermined number of British citizens disappeared from their hotels, heading out of Austria, most likely by car. But the same media reports also mentioned the lack of adherence to crowd avoidance and social distancing on the part of Austrian skiers at the slopes. I'm focusing on this to point out that human behavior may also be significantly driving increased transmission during this period. There is NPI fatigue (or just bravado on the heels of less than exemplar political messages) in many countries.

As for the identification of the variant in the USA, folks are now seeking and they shall be and are finding. The comment in the media report that most cases have been identified in travellers from the UK may be misleading as a conclusion, as the study population for performing genomic studies has focused on recent arrivals from the UK. There is a need to do genomic sequencing on a larger sample of virus positive individuals over the past few months... Did the variant begin in the UK or was it merely first detected in the UK? - Mod.MPP]

Chile has recorded its 1st case of the new COVID-19 variant -- first detected in England -- in a passenger who returned to the country recently after visiting London, a senior Chilean health ministry official announced on Tuesday [29 Dec 2020]. The country's undersecretary of public health, Paula Daza, said a Chilean woman who arrived on a flight from Madrid on [22 Dec 2020] tested positive for the variant. The woman spent a week in London visiting relatives before flying to Chile from Madrid.

"All emergency measures have been taken and the person has already been transferred to a local hospital to be monitored by health personnel," Daza said. She said that the woman is in good health and that contract tracing is being carried out. Health authorities have since announced a mandatory 10-day quarantine for all people arriving in Chile from abroad, beginning on Thursday [31 Dec 2020].

Around 33 000 passengers arrived in India from the UK -- where a more infectious coronavirus variant was 1st detected -- between [25 Nov and 23 Dec 2020], when flight operations were suspended. Of all the returnees, 114 tested positive for COVID-19.

Now 6 of them have been confirmed to have been infected by and carrying the new variant of SARS-CoV-2. The genome sequencing for the rest is under way at various laboratories in India. Of the 6 COVID-19 patients carrying new variant of coronavirus, 3 are in Bengaluru's NIMHANS [National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences], 2 in Hyderabad's Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology and the other in Pune's National Institute of Virology. All 6 patients are in isolation. Their close contacts have been traced and put under quarantine. Comprehensive contact tracing is under way.

What is matter of concern for India is that the new variant has been detected at a time when the country is reporting fresh cases of COVID-19 at the level that was reported way back in June [2020]. And, for the 1st time, all states and union territories of India have reported declining number of cases on weekly basis.

["Since November 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) has reported a rapid increase in COVID-19 cases in London and south east England. This rapid increase in cases has been linked to a different version -- or variant -- of the virus that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2). Public health professionals in the UK are evaluating the characteristics of this new variant." (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/transmission/variant.html).

As a preemptive measure to stop the transmission of this variant from the UK, many countries have temporarily suspended flight operations to and from the UK. India is one of them. As indicated in the news report above, between 25 Nov and 23 Dec 2020, prior to flight suspension, around 33 000 passengers arrived in India from the UK. They have seemingly been screened for the presence of the virus, and 6 of them have tested positive for the new variant. India is the 1st South Asian country reporting the detection of the new variant in its territory. - Mod.PKB

As mentioned earlier, we are in the "seek and ye shall find" phase of identifying the geographic spread of the virus. Again, it will be interesting when studies are done on isolates obtained several months ago to see if the variants appeared outside the UK earlier than in the past week or two. - Mod.MPP]

[2] China: Wuhan serosurvey

Nearly half a million residents in the Chinese city where the novel coronavirus first emerged may have been infected with COVID-19 -- almost 10 times its official number of confirmed cases, according to a study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The study used a sample of 34 000 people in the general population in Wuhan -- the original epicenter of the pandemic -- and other cities in Hubei province, as well as Beijing, Shanghai, and the provinces of Guangdong, Jiangsu, Sichuan, and Liaoning to estimate COVID-19 infection rates.

The researchers found an antibody prevalence rate of 4.43% for COVID-19 among residents in Wuhan, a metropolis of 11 million people. As of Sunday [27 Dec 2020], Wuhan had reported a total of 50 354 confirmed cases of COVID-19, according to the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission.

The study aimed to estimate the scale of past infections in a population by testing blood serum samples from a pool of people for coronavirus antibodies. Its findings are not taken to be final statistics of how many people in a given area have been exposed to the virus.

The Chinese CDC said the study was conducted a month after China "contained the 1st wave of the COVID-19 epidemic". The prevalence rate outside of Wuhan is significantly lower, the study showed. In other cities in Hubei, only 0.44% of residents surveyed were found to have coronavirus antibodies. Outside the province, antibodies were only detected in 2 people among the more than 12 000 residents surveyed. The results of the study were revealed in a Chinese CDC post on social media Monday [28 Dec 2020]. It did not mention whether the study has been published in an academic journal.

Underreported coronavirus infections
------------------------------------
Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the study points to a problem of underreporting in infections during the height of the outbreak in Wuhan, partly due to the chaos at the time and a failure to include asymptomatic cases in the official count of confirmed cases.

In January [2020] and February [2020], patients with fevers flooded Wuhan's hospitals, which lacked the manpower, testing kits, and medical resources to diagnose and treat them. Instead, many were told to go home and self-isolate -- some ended up infecting other family members, while others died at home without being recorded in the COVID-19 death tolls. Underreporting is a problem faced by health authorities in many countries, often due to a lack of capacity and resources. Antibody studies conducted by researchers in other parts of the world also show the coronavirus was much more prevalent than official numbers suggest.

A study sponsored by the New York State Department of Health, for example, showed that by the end of March [2020], one in 7 New York adults had COVID-19 -- about 10 times higher than the official account. In August [2020], another study found coronavirus antibodies in more than 27% of the 1.5 million New York City residents tested.

But in China, there is also the question of transparency, as officials gave the public more optimistic data than they had access to internally. [China is not alone in that. - Mod.MPP]. Since [12 Feb 2020], Hubei health authorities started to include "clinically diagnosed cases" in the count of confirmed infections. On that day, some 13 000 previously undisclosed "clinically diagnosed cases" in the province were added to new confirmed infections, resulting in a 9-fold increase in daily cases from the previous day.

Authorities have also cracked down on citizen journalists who reported on the harsh reality of overflowing hospitals in Wuhan. On Monday [28 Dec 2020], Zhang Zhan, a former lawyer who documented the outbreak at its height in Wuhan, was sentenced to 4 years in jail for "picking quarrels and provoking trouble". 2 other independent journalists -- Li Zehua and Fang Bin -- were also detained following their coverage of the outbreak.

[The communication from the China CDC is available in Chinese at https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/LXTfDmsQLf3qZnu_S_MxcA. A machine translation follows:

"Recently, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention organized the completion of a national seroepidemiological survey and analysis of new coronavirus pneumonia. The purpose of this investigation was to understand the situation of the new coronavirus infection in the general population in areas with different levels of the new coronavirus pneumonia, deepen the scientific understanding of the characteristics of the new coronavirus pneumonia infection, and evaluate the effectiveness of the country's epidemic prevention and control.

"The survey covered 3 types of areas, including Wuhan, cities, and prefectures outside Wuhan, Hubei, and 6 provinces outside Hubei (Beijing, Liaoning, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Guangdong, and Sichuan). A sample survey design was used to select more than 34 000 people in the community. By testing the subjects' serum antibodies to the new coronavirus, the level of infection of the new coronavirus in the population was estimated. The survey adopted a cross-sectional survey method, and the survey time point selected was one month after the country had contained the 1st wave of COVID-19. The investigation found that the positive rate of new coronavirus antibodies in the community population in Wuhan was 4.43%, and the positive rate of antibodies in other cities and prefectures of Wuhan, Hubei was 0.44%. Among more than 12 000 people in 6 provinces outside Hubei, only 2 cases of antibody positive were detected, and the positivity rate was extremely low. The positivity rate of antibodies in people who had been in contact with confirmed cases of new coronavirus pneumonia was significantly higher than that of other groups, and the positivity rate of antibodies in the middle-aged and elderly population was higher than that of other age groups.
The survey results show that the population of our country is generally at a low level of infection, indicating that the epidemic control with Wuhan as the main battlefield has been successful and effectively prevented the large-scale spread of the epidemic.

"In order to facilitate the public's scientific understanding of this seroepidemiological survey, our center organized relevant experts to write the following question and answer.

"This survey is the 1st large-scale population-based survey of the positive rate of new coronavirus antibodies in areas with different epidemic levels in China. National representative surveys conducted in other countries found that after the 1st wave of epidemics, the population infection rate was generally low. A 2-stage random sampling survey conducted in Spain from [27 Apr 2020] to [11 May 2020] found that the national average seropositive rate was in the range of 3.7%-6.2%. A follow-up study of a nationally representative population cohort conducted in Switzerland from [6 Apr 2020] to [9 May 2020] found that the antibody-positive rate at week 5 was approximately 11%." [Source: New coronavirus pneumonia prevention and control technology group, China Center for Disease Control and Prevention]

These results are not surprising as the rate of asymptomatic and mild infection has been found to be higher. Studies have consistently shown significantly higher numbers of infections than reported by areas or countries when serosurveys are conducted. It is fatiguing to see the media and political reports singling out countries for lack of transparency. Especially when conclusions are drawn as part of 2020 hindsight.

[3] Post COVID-19 psychosis
Date: Mon 28 Dec 2020
Source: The New York Times [abridged, edited]

Dr Hisam Goueli [quickly saw] that the patient who came to his psychiatric hospital on Long Island this summer [2020] was unusual. The patient, a 42 year old physical therapist and mother of 4 young children, had never had psychiatric symptoms or any family history of mental illness. Yet there she was, sobbing and saying that she kept seeing her children, ages 2 to 10, being gruesomely murdered and that she herself had crafted plans to kill them. The only notable thing about her medical history was that the woman ... had become infected with the coronavirus in the spring [2020]. She had experienced only mild physical symptoms from the virus, but, months later, she heard a voice that first told her to kill herself and then told her to kill her children. At South Oaks Hospital, which has an inpatient psychiatric treatment program for COVID-19 patients, Dr Goueli was unsure whether the coronavirus was connected to the woman's psychological symptoms. "Maybe this is COVID-related, maybe it's not," he recalled thinking. "But then," he said, "we saw a 2nd case, a 3rd case and a 4th case, and we're like, 'There's something happening.'"

Indeed, doctors are reporting similar cases across the country and around the world. A small number of COVID patients who had never experienced mental health problems are developing severe psychotic symptoms weeks after contracting the coronavirus.
In interviews and scientific articles, doctors described:
- a 36 year old nursing home employee in North Carolina who became so paranoid that she believed her 3 children would be kidnapped and, to save them, tried to pass them through a fast-food restaurant's drive-through window;
- a 30 year old construction worker in New York City who became so delusional that he imagined his cousin was going to murder him, and, to protect himself, he tried to strangle his cousin in bed;
- a 55 year old woman in Britain had hallucinations of monkeys and a lion and became convinced a family member had been replaced by an impostor.

Beyond individual reports, a British study of neurological or psychiatric complications in 153 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 found that 10 people had "new-onset psychosis". Another study identified 10 such patients in one hospital in Spain. And in COVID-related social media groups, medical professionals discuss seeing patients with similar symptoms in the Midwest, Great Plains, and elsewhere.

"My guess is any place that is seeing COVID is probably seeing this," said Dr Colin Smith at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, who helped treat the North Carolina woman. Medical experts say they expect that such extreme psychiatric dysfunction will affect only a small proportion of patients. But the cases are considered examples of another way the COVID-19 disease process can affect mental health and brain function.

Although the coronavirus was initially thought primarily to cause respiratory distress, there is now ample evidence of many other symptoms, including neurological, cognitive, and psychological effects, that [can] emerge even in patients who [have not suffered] serious lung, heart, or circulatory problems. Such symptoms can be just as debilitating to a person's ability to function and work, and it's often unclear how long they will last or how to treat them.

Experts increasingly believe brain-related effects may be linked to the body's immune system response to the coronavirus and possibly to vascular problems or surges of inflammation caused by the disease process. "Some of the neurotoxins that are reactions to immune activation can go to the brain, through the blood-brain barrier, and can induce this damage," said Dr Vilma Gabbay, a co-director of the Psychiatry Research Institute at Montefiore Einstein in the Bronx. Brain scans, spinal fluid analyses, and other tests didn't find any brain infection, said Dr Gabbay, whose hospital has treated 2 patients with post-COVID psychosis: a 49 year old man who heard voices and believed he was the devil and a 34 year old woman who began carrying a knife, disrobing in front of strangers and putting hand sanitizer in her food.

Physically, most of these patients didn't get very sick from COVID-19, reports indicate. The patients that Dr Goueli treated experienced no respiratory problems, but they did have subtle neurological symptoms like hand tingling, vertigo, headaches, or diminished smell. Then, 2 weeks to several months later, he said, they "develop this profound psychosis, which is really dangerous and scary to all of the people around them."

Also striking is that most patients have been in their 30s, 40s, and 50s. "It's very rare for you to develop this type of psychosis in this age range," Dr Goueli said, since such symptoms more typically accompany schizophrenia in young people or dementia in older patients. And some patients -- like the physical therapist who took herself to the hospital -- understood something was wrong, while usually "people with psychosis don't have an insight that they've lost touch with reality."

Some post-COVID patients who developed psychosis needed weeks of hospitalization in which doctors tried different medications before finding one that helped. Dr Robert Yolken, a neurovirology expert at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, said that although people might recover physically from COVID-19, in some cases their immune systems, might be unable to shut down or might remain engaged because of "delayed clearance of a small amount of virus". Persistent immune activation is also a leading explanation for brain fog and memory problems bedeviling many COVID survivors, and Emily Severance, a schizophrenia expert at Johns Hopkins, said post-COVID cognitive and psychiatric effects might result from "something similar happening in the brain." It may hinge on which brain region the immune response affects, Dr Yolken said, adding, "some people have neurological symptoms, some people psychiatric and many people have a combination."

Experts don't know whether genetic makeup or perhaps an undetected predisposition for psychiatric illness put some people at greater risk. Dr Brian Kincaid, medical director of psychiatric emergency department services at Duke, said the North Carolina woman once had a skin reaction to another virus, which might suggest her immune system responds zealously to viral infections. Sporadic cases of post-infectious psychosis and mania have occurred with other viruses, including the 1918 flu and the coronaviruses SARS and MERS. "We think that it's not unique to COVID," said Dr Jonathan Alpert, chairman of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, who co-wrote the report on the Montefiore patients. He said studying these cases might help to increase doctors' understanding of psychosis.

The symptoms have ranged widely, some surprisingly severe for a 1st psychotic episode, experts said. Dr Goueli said a 46 year old pharmacy technician, whose family brought her in after she became fearful that evil spirits had invaded her home, "cried literally for 4 days" in the hospital. He said the 30 year old construction worker, brought to the hospital by the police, became "extremely violent", dismantling a hospital radiator and using its parts and his shoes to try to break out of a window. He also swung a chair at hospital staff.

How long the psychosis lasted and patients' response to treatment has varied. The woman in Britain -- whose symptoms included paranoia about the color red and terror that nurses were devils who would harm her and a family member -- took about 40 days to recover, according to a case report. The 49 year old man treated at Montefiore was discharged after several weeks' hospitalization, but "he was still struggling 2 months out" and required readmission, Dr Gabbay said.

The North Carolina woman, who was convinced that cellphones were tracking her and that her partner would steal her pandemic stimulus money, didn't improve with the 1st medication, said Dr Jonathan Komisar at Duke, who said doctors initially thought her symptoms reflected bipolar disorder. "When we began to realize that maybe this isn't going to resolve immediately," he said, she was given an antipsychotic, risperidone, and discharged in a week.

The physical therapist who planned to murder her children had more difficulty. "Every day, she was getting worse," Dr Goueli said. "We tried probably 8 different medicines," including antidepressants, antipsychotics, and lithium. "She was so ill that we were considering electroconvulsive therapy for her because nothing was working." Ultimately, risperidone proved effective and after 4 weeks, she returned home to her family, "95 per cent perfect," he said.

"We don't know what the natural course of this is," Dr Goueli said. "Does this eventually go away? Do people get better? How long does that normally take? And are you then more prone to have other psychiatric issues as a result? There are just so many unanswered questions."

[Lim and colleagues presented a case report of a post COVID-19 patient presenting with a florid psychosis including delusions, visual, and auditory hallucinations, and an elevated TNF (tumor necrosis factor) with symptoms lasting 40 days. Studies including MRIs, EEC, CSF, and autoimmune panel were normal. They concluded the etiology was either an inflammatory state or an unproven, hypothesized "antibody-mediated encephalitic event induced by viral infection."

Tariku and Hajure did a literature review and concluded that multinational reports of psychotic symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection had been reported. Symptoms included hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech and disorganized behaviors. But they felt a conclusion of causal association was premature based on their review.

Lanier and colleagues presented a case of acute psychosis as a presenting symptom of an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, and raised an alert that COVID-19 should be considered as a possible presenting symptom.

A PubMed search reveals the psychiatric community has been recognizing this phenomenon for some time now. This virus continues to throw curve balls, with new syndromic presentations to be aware of.

Date: Tue 29 Dec 2020
Source: WHO, Emergency Situational Updates [edited, abridged]
https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/weekly-epidemiological-update---29-december-2020


Data as received by WHO from national authorities, as of [27 Dec 2020], 10 am CET. Other information collected by epidemic intelligence activities and verified by WHO.

Overview
--------
Globally in the past week, over 4 million new COVID-19 cases and 72 000 new deaths were reported. This brings the cumulative numbers to over 79 million reported cases and over 1.7 million deaths globally since the start of the pandemic.

Global epidemiological situation
--------------------------------
Globally in the past week, over 4 million new cases were reported. Although this is 12% lower than the previous week, this and other short-term trends in data should be interpreted with caution over the end-of-year holiday season, as numbers may be influenced by presentation, testing and reporting delays. New deaths decreased by 8% to 72 730 (Figure 1, Table 1). The Region of the Americas accounts for 48% of all new cases and 42% of all new deaths globally. While new cases and deaths remained high in the European region, which accounted for 37% and 42% respectively, both decreased compared with the previous week. New cases and deaths declined in South East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean regions. In the African region, while both new cases and deaths remained low compared with other regions, there was a 20% increase in new cases and 37% in new deaths. In the Western Pacific Region, new cases increased by 13% and new deaths increased by 4%. As of [27 Dec 2020] over 79.2 million cases and over 1.7 million deaths have been reported since the start of the pandemic.

A variant of SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in South Africa through retrospective genomic analyses of the virus. Initial analysis indicates that the variant, known as 501Y.V2, may spread more readily between people. Investigations are ongoing to determine if it is associated with any change in the severity of infection, antibody response or vaccine efficacy.

Situation by WHO region
-----------------------
[Format change: an unnamed figure showing weekly cases and deaths in each region is included at the end of each regional update]

- African Region
In the past week, over 114 000 new cases were reported in the African region, 20% more than in the previous week, and over 2500 deaths, a 37% increase over the previous week. South Africa continues to account for the greatest proportion (72%) of new weekly cases in the region. In the past week, the highest number of new cases were reported from South Africa (82 434 new cases; 1390 new cases per 1 million population), Nigeria (5643 new cases; 27 new cases per 1 million), Algeria (3076 new cases, 70 new cases per 1 million), and Namibia (2961 new cases, 1165 new cases per 1 million). The highest numbers of new deaths were reported from South Africa (1982 new deaths; 33 new deaths per 1 million), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (197 new deaths; 2 new deaths per 1 million), and Algeria (63 new deaths; 1 new death per 1 million).

- Region of the Americas
In the region of the Americas, the number of new weekly cases was over 1 965 000 and 31 142 new deaths, which represent 15% and 3% decreases over the previous week, respectively. The United States of America accounted for 68% of all new cases in the region. The highest new case and deaths counts were reported in the United States of America (1 334 155 new cases, 4031 new cases per 1 million), Brazil (285 582 new cases; 1344 new cases per 1 million), and Colombia (92 635 new cases, 1821 new cases per 1 million). The highest numbers of new deaths were reported from the United States of America (16 864 new deaths; 51 new deaths per 1 million), Brazil (2838 new deaths; 23 new deaths per 1 million), and Mexico (4588 new deaths; 36 new deaths per 1 million).

- Eastern Mediterranean Region
The Eastern Mediterranean region reported over 157 000 new cases and over 3400 new deaths, reflecting reductions of 9% and 10%, respectively, compared with the previous week. Cases and deaths in the region decreased for the 5th consecutive week. The highest number of new cases were reported from the Islamic Republic of Iran (42 891 new cases, 511 new cases per 1 million), Morocco (15 336 new cases, 415 new cases per 1 million), and Pakistan (14 809 new cases, 67 new cases per 1 million). These 3 countries accounted for the most new cases in the previous 2 weeks. The highest number of new deaths were reported from the Islamic Republic of Iran (1126 new deaths; 13 new deaths per 1 million), Pakistan (566 new deaths; 3 new deaths per 1 million), and Tunisia (300 new deaths; 25 new deaths per 1 million).

- European Region
The number of new cases in the European region remains high with over 1.5 million reported in the past week. However, the number of new cases has declined over the past week, decreasing by 12%, while deaths decreased by 15% to 31 000 new deaths. Despite the observed reductions, the European region continues to account for the 2nd highest number of new cases and deaths globally (37% and 42%, respectively). Last week, the countries reporting the highest number of new cases were the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (251 786 new cases, 3709 new cases per 1 million), the Russian Federation (201 871 new cases; 1383 new cases per 1 million population), and Germany (146 849 new cases; 1753 new cases per 1 million). The highest number of deaths were reported from the same countries, namely Russian Federation (3920 new deaths; 27 new deaths per 1 million), Germany (3729 new deaths; 45 new deaths per 1 million), and the United Kingdom (3330 new deaths; 49 new deaths per 1 million).

- South East Asia Region
In the South East Asia region, nearly 232 000 new cases were reported last week, a 6% less than in the previous week, while new deaths were nearly 4000, a slight decrease of 1%. There has been an overall decline in both cases and deaths since the peak in the week beginning [7 Sep 2020]. The countries reporting the highest number of both new cases and new deaths in the past week were India (156 627 new cases; 113 new cases per 1 million; 2145 new deaths; 2 new deaths per 1 million), Indonesia (48 889 new cases; 179 new cases per 1 million; 1335 new deaths; 5 new deaths per 1 million), and Bangladesh (8539 new cases; 52 new cases per 1 million; 186 new deaths; 1 new death per 1 million).

- Western Pacific Region
In the Western Pacific region, new cases (13%) and deaths (4%) continued to increase, a trend which has been seen over the past 8 weeks. The region reported over 53 000 new cases and nearly 700 new deaths. The highest new cases were reported in Japan (21 432 new cases; 169 new cases per 1 million), Malaysia (11 931 new cases; 369 new cases per 1 million), and the Philippines (10 961 new cases; 100 new cases per 1 million). The countries reporting the highest number of new deaths this week were Japan (340 new deaths; 3 new deaths per 1 million), the Philippines (156 new deaths; 1 new death per 1 million), and the Republic of Korea (134 new deaths; 3 new deaths per 1 million).

Data, table, and figure notes
-----------------------------
Data presented are based on official laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case and deaths reported to WHO by country/territories/areas, largely based upon WHO case definitions and surveillance guidance. While steps are taken to ensure accuracy and reliability, all data are subject to continuous verification and change, and caution must be taken when interpreting these data as several factors influence the counts presented, with variable underestimation of true case and death incidence, and variable delays to reflecting these data at global level. Case detection, inclusion criteria, testing strategies, reporting practices, and data cut-off and lag times differ between countries/territories/areas. A small number of countries/territories/areas report combined probable and laboratory-confirmed cases. Differences are to be expected between information products published by WHO, national public health authorities, and other sources. Due to public health authorities conducting data reconciliation exercises which remove large numbers of cases or deaths from their total counts, negative numbers may be displayed in the new cases/deaths columns as appropriate. When additional details become available that allow the subtractions to be suitably apportioned to previous days, graphics will be updated accordingly. See the log of major changes and errata for details [https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/log-of-major-changes-and-errata-in-who-daily-aggregate-case-and-death-count-data]. Prior situation reports will not be edited; see https://covid19.who.int for the most up-to-date data [see section [B] below for today's update. - Mod.MPP]

Global totals include 745 cases and 13 deaths reported from international conveyances.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains 218.

Data by country, area, or territory for 29 Dec 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesDEC29_1609280123.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 45.5% of daily case numbers and 29.8% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, but maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 34.8 million cases. Costa Rica, among other countries, did not report any new cases in the past 24 hours. Reported numbers still significantly lower than in the pre-holiday period (USA and Brazil are noticeably reduced).

- The European region reported 39.8% of daily case numbers and 52.7% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 25.6 million. Countries not reporting cases include Belgium (5 cases), Sweden, Israel, and Kazakhstan, among others.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 4.5% of daily case numbers and 4.8% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 4.86 million cases. Iran is dominant with decreasing daily case counts now just around 5900, followed by Pakistan, Jordan, Tunisia, Lebanon, Palestinian Authority, Egypt, and the UAE. Morocco, Iraq, and Libya reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000.

- The African region reported 3.0% of daily case numbers and 5.6% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.85 million cases. South Africa maintains its dominance, but decreased reporting around 7400 new cases, followed by Mauritania, Ethiopia, DR Congo, Nigeria, Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Sudan, Kenya, Mayotte, Senegal, and Ghana. Algeria, Uganda, Cameroon, Namibia, Madagascar, Mozambique, Angola, Botswana, and Eswatini/Swaziland, among other countries, did not report any new cases.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.5% of daily case numbers and 1.4% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 1.07 million cases. Japan is dominant, although having decreased to just below 2900 cases, followed by Malaysia, South Korea, Philippines, French Polynesia, and China.

- The South East Asia region reported 5.7% of the daily newly reported cases and 5.8% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 11.8 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant although with decreasing numbers of cases (around 16 000), followed by Indonesia (around 5800), Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka. Thailand reported 299 cases.

Impression: Holiday period artifact has impacted reporting, especially in the Americas and European regions. In spite of that, there is a continued dominance of Europe and the Americas region representing over 85% of newly confirmed cases and over 82% of newly reported deaths in the past 24 hours. The USA maintains its position as the country reporting the most cases and deaths on a daily basis, even despite decreased reporting over the holiday period.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (196 080), Brazil (57 227), UK (53 135), and Sweden (32 485), have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 14 827 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (28-29 Dec 2020).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (16 countries) include the USA, Brazil, UK, Sweden, Russia (27 002), India (20 529), Germany (15 960), Turkey (15 805), Mexico (12 099), Spain (11 985), Argentina (11 650), France (11 395), Italy (11 210), Colombia (11 015), Czech Republic (10 862), and Canada (10 299).

A total of 57 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 29 of the 57 countries that reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 11 are from the Americas region, 10 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and one from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 13.1%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 11.9%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the United States show a 16.1% decrease in daily reported cases and a 20.3% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported cases are over 650 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours and over 82 million cumulative reported cases with almost 1.8 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts even with reductions in daily case reports due to the period, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, South East Asia, and Western Pacific regions. The USA is approaching 20 million confirmed cases and 350 000 deaths. - Mod.MPP]
