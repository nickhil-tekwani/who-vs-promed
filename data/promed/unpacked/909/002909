Abstract
--------
Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne disease caused by the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). Rift Valley fever affects a large number of species, including human, and has severe impact on public health and the economy, especially in African countries. The present study examined the vector competence of 3 different European mosquito species, _Culex pipiens_ (Linnaeus, 1758) form _molestus_ (Diptera: Culicidae), _Cx. pipiens_ hybrid form, and _Stegomyia albopicta_ (_Aedes albopictus_) (Skuse, 1894) (Diptera: Culicidae). Mosquitoes were artificially fed with blood containing RVFV. Infection, disseminated infection and transmission efficiency were evaluated. This is the 1st study to assess the transmission efficiency of European mosquito species using a virulent RVFV strain. The virus disseminated in _Cx. pipiens_ hybrid form and in _S. albopicta_. Moreover, infectious viral particles were isolated from saliva of both species, showing their RVFV transmission capacity. The presence of competent _Cx. pipiens_ and _S. albopicta_ in Spain indicates that an autochthonous outbreak of RVF may occur if the virus is introduced. These findings provide information that will help health authorities to set up efficient entomological surveillance and RVFV vector control programmes.

[RVFV can move outside the traditionally endemic sub-Saharan region and into other regions, as demonstrated in the past in Comoros Islands, Madagascar, Egypt, and the Arabian Peninsula. In addition to these regions, which are geographically adjacent to RVFV-endemic countries, in other more distant areas of the world the ecological infrastructure exists to allow RVFV to potentially thrive in vector, wildlife, livestock, and human hosts. The virus could be purposefully introduced into new areas as a tactic of bioterrorism, or moved accidentally via viremic mosquitoes (including infected mosquito eggs), humans, wildlife, or livestock along the extensive networks of global transportation, expanding the range of the virus to other continents. Humans, for instance, may develop RVFV viremia sufficient to infect naive mosquitoes. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that European as well as North American mosquito species of medical or veterinary importance can become infected with and transmit RVFV (see also Table 2 in ref 1 below).

Prevention might best be exercised through vigilance and monitoring of RVF activity in endemic settings and increased vigilance for RVFV at high-risk locations in other continents that are connected to these endemic areas.

An extensive discussion of the issue can be found in a recent US-government sponsored review (1).
