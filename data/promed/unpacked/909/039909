A health alert has been declared in Brazil, Paraguay, and Bolivia
after an outbreak of dengue fever. The authorities have blamed higher
rainfall this season as a cause of the unusually rapid spread of the
disease. Experts also say the uncommonly warm weather has boosted the
population of mosquitoes, which transmit the disease.

Dengue fever is not uncommon in South America, where thousands of
cases are recorded every year. The difference this time is the speed
with which the disease has spread across the south of the continent.

Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia and, to a lesser extent, Argentina have
been affected by the outbreak - but it is Brazil and Paraguay which
have seen the worst of it.

Fatalities
------------------
In the southwestern Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul it is
estimated that more than 15 000 people have been infected this year
[2007] -- more than all the cases registered in 2006.

In Paraguay there have been more than 3000 cases and 4 people have
already died. In Bolivia, a young nurse died last week [week of 28
Jan 2007].

The authorities have called on the population to take more preventive
measures to avoid infection. In the meantime, the authorities in
Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay have declared a health alert and
increased measures to try to stop the outbreak from escalating into a
fully blown regional epidemic.

A 2nd person has died of dengue since the outbreak of the disease in
the north of Peru, the Health Ministry said on Thursday [8 Feb 2007].

A man died in the Trujillo Regional Hospital, in the province of La
Libertad, 550 km. North of Peru's capital, Lima, after suffering high
fever, hemorrhage and pain all over her body.

Another 133 cases of dengue fever have been detected by the Regional
Health Directorate (DRS) in the El Porvenir district [of La Libertad
] province, where the victim has been living.

The 1st victim, a 79-year-old man, who died last week [week of 28 Jan
2007], was also a resident of La Libertad.

The ministry said it started anti-mosquito spraying in a bid to stamp
out the mosquito by clearing out stagnant water where it breeds.

The DRS has identified 4525 homes, which are at risk from the
mosquito that spreads dengue, and has declared a state of health
emergency in the region.

Another 16 cases were found this year [2007] in the neighboring
province of Lambayeque, some 200 km. distant, the Ministry said,
adding that there was a 150-case outbreak of dengue in the province
last year.

The Ministry examined dengue samples sent to the [capital] and said
there have been no cases of hemorrhagic dengue in Lambayeque.

Dengue Outbreak in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia
--------------------------------------------------
An increase in the transmission of dengue is currently being
reported, with the greatest number of cases concentrated in Santa
Cruz de la Sierra.

Up to 7 Feb 2007 (Epidemiological Week No. 6), the following figures
have been reported:
* 459 suspected cases of dengue fever
* 118 confirmed cases of classical dengue fever
* 4 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever
* one death
* Case-fatality rate [of DHF]: 25 percent
* Affected departments: Santa Cruz de la Sierra and small adjacent cities.

In Bolivia, Santa Cruz de la Sierra is an area endemic for dengue,
displaying an almost seasonal behavior with periods of greatest
incidence and reports of cases occurring historically during the
months of November and May, as is shown in the figure from the
January 2007 issue (No. 2, covering Epidemiological Week 2) of the
Weekly Surveillance Bulletin (Boletin Semanal de Vigilancia, No.
2/2007 <http://www.sns.gov.bo/reloaa1/boletines_vigil/BOLETIN%2002-06.pdf>)
of the National Health Information System of the Ministry of Health
and Sports (Sistema Nacional de Informacion de Salud / SNIS,
Ministerio de Salud y Deportes). An increase in the transmission of
dengue is currently being reported, with the greatest number of cases
concentrated in Santa Cruz de la Sierra.

According to the information received, 459 suspected cases have been
reported and 188 of them have been confirmed, out of which 118
correspond to Santa Cruz and 70 to other small adjacent cities. Also
confirmed are 4 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever and one death.

Prevention and Control Activities Underway
--------------------------------------------------
* An extra-sectoral commission has been created that includes the
PAHO/WHO Country Office.
* Dr. Jose Carlos Arraya, Chief of the National Dengue Program,
reported that intensive action is being taken to eliminate
mosquito-breeding sites, with support from the Armed Forces (Police).
* Two mass-media campaigns are scheduled to take place on 9 and 10
Feb 2007, in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, where full-scale activities to
eliminate vector-breeding sites have been underway. This involves
environmental reorganization [intervention? - Mod.TY] on the part of
the population.
* Treatment and control activities aimed at eliminating breeding
sites using Abate (1 percent Temephos) and adult mosquitoes (using
fumigation) are being carried out through four campaigns supported by
central-level supervisors.

Clinic-Level Activities
--------------------------------------------------
At the same time, training was held to bring health workers up to
date on the clinical management of dengue cases. More than 200
medical and support personnel attended. This activity has been
strengthened a great deal in recent years as a result of PAHO/WHO
advisors conducting the training sessions.

Preparation of the Strategy of Integrated Management for the
Prevention and Control of Dengue in Bolivia
--------------------------------------------------
At present, plans have been made to reinforce the National Dengue
Plan using the Strategy of Integrated Management for the Prevention
and Control of Dengue (EGI-Dengue). By the end of the 1st semester
2007, a solid technical document will have been produced, with the
following in mind:
1. to serve as a standard guidebook for the roll-out of prevention
and control activities; and
2. strengthen the capacities of the health sector to promote new
extra-sectoral associations and methodologies for behavioral changes
in controlling the most important breeding sites of the vector, thus
3. making activities in the fight against dengue more sustainable.

During the week of 19-24 Mar 2007, a workshop will be held to
reinforce COMBI (Communication for Behavioral Impact). Dr. Linda
Lloyd, in her capacity as PAHO/WHO Temporary Adviser and expert in
the area of Mass Communication, will conduct the workshop.

Health authorities confirmed that 3 dengue cases have been detected
on Easter Island [Isla de Pascua in Spanish], and have put into
action measures to eradicate the outbreak.

In a press release in Valparaiso, the Undersecretary of Health, Lidia
Amarales, said on Saturday [10 Feb 2007] that the affected
individuals are 2 men ages 33 and 46 years, and a woman of 27 years,
all of who are undergoing treatment on the island. In addition, there
are 2 other individuals with febrile disease compatible with dengue
fever, said Amarales.

She added that the cases were confirmed as having been infected with
dengue 1 [virus], its most benign form. [Although these 3 confirmed
and 2 suspected cases may not be especially severe, none of the 4
dengue virus serotypes can be classified as uniformly "benign". -
Mod.TY]

Dengue [fever], termed "nao nao" in the [local] Rapa Nui language,
was 1st detected on Easter Island in 2000, but the most serious
outbreak was in 2002, when 600 cases were reported on this small
Pacific island.

Currently, the island is celebrating the traditional "Tapati"
festival with the usual population of 4000 inhabitants practically
doubling for 2 weeks.

Undersecretary Amarales called on the local residents and tourists to
undertake measures to avoid proliferation of the mosquito vector
_Aedes aegypti_. She explained that trash and other recipients in
which water could accumulate and serve as breeding sites should be
eliminated, and bed nets and insect repellents sent from the mainland
should be used. [Elimination of breeding sites is very important.
Because _Ae. aegypti_ are day-biting mosquitoes, bed nets may not be
particularly useful to avoid transmission. - Mod.TY]

The Minister of Health confirmed this Sunday [11 Feb 2007] that a
team of professionals will be sent to the island, under the
supervision of the Regional Secretary [of Health], Nestor Irribarra,
which will deal with this emergency.

The team, with help of navy personnel, will fumigate the entire
island starting Monday [12 Feb 2007], starting with the town of Hanga
Roa and vicinity, action focused on [the areas] of the [dengue fever]
cases. Also, aircraft going between the island and the Chilean
mainland will be fumigated to avoid [mosquito] transport of the
[virus] to Chile, which has been free of the disease.

[Avoiding inadvertent transport of infected mosquitoes to the Chilean
mainland is prudent, but it would be more difficult to avoid
transport of infected individuals incubating dengue virus infection,
especially tourists and visitors for the "Tapati" festival. We wish
the Chilean health authorities success in controlling the outbreak
and congratulate them for their prompt and vigorous response to the
situation.

[5] Paraguay

Experts from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) are working
with health authorities in Paraguay to help control an outbreak of
dengue fever that has affected a number of communities throughout the
nation and has raised concerns among neighboring countries in South
America.

PAHO officials warn that the entire Latin America region needs to
take preventive measures to prepare for what promises to be a
"difficult year" for dengue.

In mid-January [2007], Paraguay declared an epidemiological alert as
new cases of dengue began to emerge. On 20 Jan [2007], the first 2
deaths of the year from dengue hemorrhagic fever were reported. By 5
Feb [2007], a total of 2967 cases of dengue fever had been reported
as well as 18 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever, including 3 deaths.
Health officials noted that in several of the affected areas, the
number of cases so far this year [2007] already exceeds the total for
2006.

"Our top priority is treating the people who are affected to prevent
more deaths," said Dr. Jose Luis San Martin, PAHO regional advisor on
dengue.

PAHO has sent a team of experts to Paraguay to provide technical
assistance in areas including medical treatment, social
communication, and health services organization. Health authorities
in Paraguay, Argentina, Brazil, and Bolivia have all stepped up
prevention in border area, including intensified surveillance and
control measures.

"Paraguay has a comprehensive strategy for preventing and controlling
dengue and has the ability to respond in an integrated way to this
increase in cases," said San Martin, noting that the country had
responded effectively to outbreaks in 2006.

Data from 2006 combined with current reports and the presence of the
weather phenomenon El Nino suggest that "2007 will be a difficult and
complex year for responding to dengue," said San Martin. "The
situation in the region really goes beyond the health sector and
requires the active participation of other sectors and actors as
well."

Ongoing cooperation between Paraguay and its neighbors includes the
establishment of border commissions and the dissemination of outbreak
information through established regional and sub regional networks.

San Martin noted that community efforts are key to preventing or
reducing outbreaks of dengue. Dengue is carried by the _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquito, which flourishes in areas with poor sanitation and
under conditions of high precipitation. "Citizens can play a
fundamental role by keeping their homes free of breeding places for
the _Ae. aegypti_ mosquito, which carries the disease," said San
Martin. [Strictly speaking, the mosquito carries the virus, not the
disease. - Mod.TY]

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that more than 2.5
billion people worldwide are at risk of dengue. Although the disease
is a greater threat in Asia and some countries of the Pacific region,
it is becoming a growing priority in the Americas.

There is currently no vaccine or cure for dengue [fever]. Prevention
efforts focus on raising public awareness of how the disease is
transmitted and getting people to take personal preventive measures,
including the use of mosquito repellant, and to eliminate breeding
sites such as water storage barrels, potted plants, pet bowls, or any
uncovered water container.

[With so many dengue fever/DHF outbreaks going on around the world
currently, eliciting governmental and international organizational
efforts to get citizens to reduce _Ae. aegypti_ breeding sites, it
would be of interest to know which of these initiatives has been
successful and why.

WHO describes dengue fever as a severe, flu-like illness that affects
infants, young children, and adults but is seldom fatal. The clinical
features of dengue fever vary according to the age of the patient.
Infants and young children may have a non-specific febrile illness
with rash (although some infants and very young children may develop
shock syndrome, with sudden loss of circulating fluid volume, and
die). Older children and adults may have either a mild febrile
syndrome or the classical incapacitating disease, with abrupt onset
and high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and
joint pains, and rash.

Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a potentially deadly complication that is
characterized by high fever, hemorrhagic phenomena -- often with
enlargement of the liver -- and in severe cases, circulatory failure.
The illness commonly begins with a sudden rise in temperature
accompanied by facial flush and other non-specific constitutional
symptoms of dengue fever. The fever usually continues for 2 to 7 days
and can be as high as 40-41 C (104-105.8 F), possibly with febrile
convulsions and hemorrhagic phenomena. In moderate DHF cases, all
signs and symptoms abate after the fever subsides. In severe cases,
the patient's condition may suddenly deteriorate after a few days of
fever; the temperature drops, followed by signs of circulatory
failure, and the patient may rapidly go into a critical state of
shock and die within 12-24 hours or quickly recover following
appropriate volume replacement therapy. There is no specific
treatment for dengue fever. However, careful clinical management by
experienced physicians and nurses frequently saves the lives of DHF
patients. With appropriate intensive supportive therapy, mortality
may be reduced to less than one percent. Maintenance of the
circulating fluid volume is the central feature of DHF case
management. (Abstracted from the WHO website fact sheet on dengue:
