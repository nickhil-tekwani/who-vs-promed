The Humane Society shot the video of what appear to be sick or lame
cattle being forced to their feet with forklifts, hoses and electric
prods at the Westland/Hallmark Meat Company in Chino, California in
October and November 2007. Released publicly in late January 2008, the
video touched off criticism of the Department of Agriculture's
inspection of the meat supply and led to the biggest beef recall in
history, 143 million pounds.

At a hearing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday [26 Feb 2008], Representative
Michael C. Burgess, Republican of Texas, assailed the Humane Society
for waiting to inform the federal government. "Why wait until February
[2008] to release the video?" Mr. Burgess demanded of a Humane Society
representative. "Why wait until now to bring this to our attention?"
His criticism echoed a point made last week by Ed Schafer, the
secretary of agriculture, who said he was "extremely disappointed" in
the Humane Society. He complained that "for 4 months, theoretically,
animals were not being properly treated, and the Humane Society stood
by and allowed it to happen."

Humane Society representatives said Tuesday [26 Feb 2008] that the
primary concern of their organization is animal welfare, not food
safety, and as soon as they had the tape they took it to local
prosecutors in California. The Humane Society said it was asked to
withhold the tape while the prosecutors conducted an investigation.
The society released the tape after growing frustrated with the pace
of that investigation. Shortly afterward, prosecutors charged 2
slaughterhouse workers with violations.

The recall of meat from Westland/Hallmark has focused attention on
potential food safety hazards, especially since some of the meat was
served to schoolchildren. Slaughtering cattle that cannot walk, known
as "downer" cattle, poses a slight risk of introducing disease into
the food supply. The Humane Society said its principal motivation in
penetrating the slaughterhouse was to check whether Westland/Hallmark
was treating animals in a humane manner. "first and foremost, the
U.S.D.A. should not be relying on a private animal welfare charity to
do its job for them," said Paul Shapiro, who oversees issues
involving farm-animal abuse for the Humane Society.

Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, said the Humane
Society should be praised, not blamed, for uncovering the abuse and
potential food safety problems at Westland/Hallmark. "It is the
height of irony that the U.S.D.A. is now trying to blame the
whistle-blower for the agency's own irresponsible behavior," she said
in an e-mail message.

Experience shows that criticism of the messenger is usually in direct
proportion to the validity of the message and frequently reflects a
desire to deflect attention away from the topic. However,
Representative Burgess is a physician, primarily in obstetrics and
gynecology, so one can understand his proper concern about the
apparent delay. The newspaper article is significantly longer than
usual, and interested readers are advised to check the full article

The Ascension Parish school system will have to dispose of more than
14 000 pounds of beef due to a recent voluntary recall by a
California meat company of 143 million pounds of its raw and frozen
beef, a school system spokesman said Tuesday [26 Feb 2008].

Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing Co. recalled the beef because it was
determined to be unfit for humans after the cattle did not receive
complete and proper inspection, according to a USDA news release.

Johnnie Balfantz, public information officer for the Ascension
schools, said school district authorities found out last week that
beef supplies stored in a warehouse freezer and in some school
freezers are part of a 2nd wave of nationwide beef recalls. Balfantz
said the school system has to dispose of 835 cases of beef. Each case
contains about 17 pounds. The school system's warehouse freezer off
Airline Highway in Sorrento has about 661 cases on hand, while the
remaining 174 cases are scattered among several school freezers,
Balfantz said. He said that all 835 cases will be trucked soon to a
local dump site, following USDA regulations. Balfantz said school
officials don't yet have a date or a location for getting rid of the
beef.

The nation's largest meat recall expanded to include processed foods
that used the meat, as 2 of the world's largest packaged-food
companies said yesterday [26 Feb 2008] that they are recalling
products. Also yesterday, the president of the California company at
the center of the recall failed to appear before a congressional
food-safety hearing, and leading Democrats are now considering
whether to subpoena him to testify. Steve Mendell, head of
Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing Co. in Chino, California, didn't show
up to answer questions before a panel of the Energy and Commerce
Committee. The company, a top supplier for the national school-lunch
program, recently recalled 143 million pounds of beef after a Humane
Society video showed cruel treatment of animals and violations of
federal regulations.

General Mills Inc., Minneapolis said it has recalled 35 000 cases of
its Progresso Italian Wedding soup because it contained beef from a
supplier that got meat from the Hallmark/Westland plant. General
Mills initiated the recall Friday [22 Feb 2008], a company
spokeswoman said. She couldn't say whether all of the product had
been removed from grocery store shelves yet. Each case of soup
contains between 6 and 12 cans.

Nestle Prepared Foods Co., which is part of Nestle SA of Switzerland,
said it has recalled some boxes of its Hot Pockets sandwiches that
contain beef from a vendor that used Hallmark/Westland. The varieties
include some Hot Pockets Philly Steak & Cheese sandwiches as well as
some Hot Pockets Croissant Crust Philly Steak & Cheese sandwiches
that were sold in 2-pack boxes.

A Nestle Prepared Foods spokeswoman said the recall encompasses about
49 000 cases of Hot Pockets, with each case containing 8 boxes of the
sandwiches. She said the company told retailers to remove the product
from stores on Friday [22 Feb 2008] but that retailers probably are
still working to get all of the product out of their system.
Supermarket chain Supervalu Inc., based in Eden Prairie, Minnesota,
said it has started to remove the Progresso soup and Hot Pockets
items as well as some frozen ground-beef patties linked to the recall
from its stores.

A spokeswoman for Hormel Foods Corp., Austin, Minnesota said no
Hormel products had been recalled. But one of the company's
subsidiaries, Farmer John's, based in Southern California, will be
recalling a "small amount" of hot dogs and cotto salami, she said.

Meanwhile, Committee Chairman John Dingell and investigations panel
Chairman Bart Stupak, both Michigan Democrats, weren't happy when Mr.
Mendell didn't appear at the congressional hearing. "It appears he
has refused our offer to testify voluntarily," Mr. Dingell said of
Mr. Mendell. "We now will have to consider whether we need to compel
his appearance to probe how onsite USDA inspectors could have missed
these safety problems and the inhumane treatment of the animals that
were slaughtered there."
