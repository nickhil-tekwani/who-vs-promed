Columbus Public Health along with other central Ohio agencies have declared community outbreak of cryptosporidiosis after more than 100 cases have been reported in the area.

There has been a recent rise over the normal threshold of cases across several jurisdictions in central Ohio, including Columbus, Franklin County and Delaware County, according to Columbus Public Health.

The 3 jurisdictions have reported more than 107 cases so far this year [2016], which is more than the last 3 years combined. This outbreak is not tied to any one location. A spokesperson with Columbus Public Health says there have been 62 cases in Columbus, 34 in Franklin County and 11 in Delaware County.

A large portion of the cases include people with multiple exposures at various recreational water facilities throughout the 3 jurisdictions.

Recently, Zoombezi Bay reported several cases of illnesses from crypto, and according to Columbus Public Health there is an overall increase of cases in area communities.

Public health officials are calling for safety measures residents can take to reduce the spread of the illness. When heading to a spray fountain, pool or water park:
- Do not swim when you have diarrhea and for 2 weeks after you recovered.
- Do not pee or poop in the water.
- Take a shower/bathe before going in the water.
- Wash hands with soap and water after using the bathroom, changing diapers and before eating.
- Change diapers in a bathroom and not by the pool.
- Take kids on frequent bathroom breaks and check diapers often.
- Avoid swallowing any water and keep it out of your mouth.

"So, you don't really have to have a fecal accident in the water or a poop accident in the water to contaminate the water system or contaminate others," said Jose Rodriguez, Director of Public Affairs and Communications for Columbus Public Health. "It is really important that if you go to the bathroom and have a bowel movement you cleanse yourself thoroughly."

"The key message is if people are sick, (they) should not go to a swimming pool," said Rodriguez.

Crypto is found in the fecal matter of a person who has been infected by crypto. It is spread by swallowing water that has been contaminated with fecal matter containing crypto. It can also be spread from human-to-human contact.

Symptoms include watery diarrhea with abdominal pain and cramping, which can be accompanied by dehydration, weight loss, fever, nausea and vomiting. Symptoms can last for 2 weeks, with improvement often followed by recurrence. Infected persons can continue to spread the disease for several weeks after diarrhea subsides, so they should avoid activities involving recreational waters for at least 2 weeks after diarrhea subsides and practice diligent handwashing.

[It is interesting that the cases are spread over many locations but a common denominator is contact with recreational water sources. Thus cryptosporidiosis is endemic in the area and not linked to a single locality. - Mod.EP
