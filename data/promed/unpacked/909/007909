State wildlife agencies and the United States Department of Homeland
Security on Wednesday were testing tissue samples from more than 1000
mallard ducks that are dying in a bizarre cluster along a south eastern
Idaho creek bed, hoping to rule out an avian flu outbreak.
The ducks mysteriously began dying last week in and around Land Springs
Creek, near the remote town of Oakley. Ducks that gather in the area
year-round and migratory mallards from Canada were still slowly perishing
at the creek, staggering and struggling to breathe before collapsing, said
Dave Parrish, regional supervisor for the Idaho Department of Fish and
Game. "It's a mystery," he said. "I've never seen anything like this in 20
years here. There were dead mallards everywhere -- in the water and on the
banks. It was odd, they were in a very small area."
Parrish said state wildlife biologists and federal investigators are not
ruling out any cause of death. The signs -- bacterial lesions in the lungs
and hemorrhaging in the heart wall -- likely point to a bacterial
infection, not bird flu, Parrish said.
Tissue from the ducks' intestinal tract and water samples from the creek
were sent to the US Fish and Wildlife Service national laboratory in
Wisconsin for testing. Samples were also sent to the University of Idaho
and Washington State University. Results were expected on Thursday and may
reveal the cause of death.
Parrish said that the ducks may have contracted a bacterial infection by
eating grain treated with pesticides by local cattle farmers. Farming
chemicals may also have spilled into the creek, he said.
Farmland surrounds the remote waterway. A cattle feedlot is close by and
several corn and alfalfa feeds [fields - Mod.TG] ring the nearby town of
Oakley. Parrish said there are no factories in the area that discharge
toxins into local streams and rivers. Wastewater does not run into the
creek, he said.
The massive outbreak is puzzling scientists because only mallard ducks are
dying. Golden eagles, geese, magpies, crows and other birds in the area all
remain healthy, Parrish said.
In the past, small outbreaks of botulism have killed water birds in Idaho,
but the disease quickly spreads among different species. "Typically, you'd
see this spread into other types of waterfowl as well," Parrish said.
In addition to Fish and Game and Homeland Security, the deaths are being
investigated by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Idaho
Department of Environmental Quality, and the local health district.
The agencies posted signs warning hunters not to eat any birds killed near
the creek.

[This does not sound like botulism, especially only affecting one species
of bird. It seems a little odd that a suspected bacterial infection would
only affect one species of bird as well. - Mod.TG]
