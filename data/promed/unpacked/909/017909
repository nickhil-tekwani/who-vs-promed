Quarantine over foot-and-mouth outbreak lifted in Amur region
-------------------------------------------------------------
The quarantine that was imposed in the Amur region village of Busse a
month ago over an outbreak of the foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] is
lifted, a source in the regional administration told Itar-Tass on
Tuesday [12 Jul 2005].
The emergency committee decided to lift the quarantine, and the head
of the Svobodnensky district adopted it. Experts of the all-Russian
institute for the protection of animals from Vladimir and specialists
from the veterinary and sanitary regional services finished an
epidemiological examination of the village on Monday. All
restrictions on supplies of meat and dairy products have been lifted.
However, Busse residents are forbidden to buy cattle or use
neighboring fields to pasture cattle for 3 months.
An outbreak of FMD has been eliminated after the full elimination of
all large and small ruminants. About 240 animals were killed and
buried in Busse. Local residents understood these measures.
The regional administration has organized supplies of provisions, and
various humanitarian aid to Busse residents, and monetary compensation
was allocated. The Amur Red Cross office and rescuers brought winter
and autumn clothes for poor villagers. Textbooks and stationery will
be brought for schoolchildren by the beginning of the new academic
year. The damage from the FMD outbreak is estimated at 7 586 000
roubles [USD 265 300].

[Besides the (exemplary) handling of this Asia 1 outbreak in Busse by
the Russian authorities, the continued absence of the disease from
Amur depends upon the efficiency of measures undertaken in
neighbouring China to control the Asia 1 spread there. - Mod.AS]
