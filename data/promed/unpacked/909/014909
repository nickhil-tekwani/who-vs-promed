Federal officials are investigating a new _Salmonella_ outbreak that is linked to brie and dips from Jule's Foods. The company has initiated a recall of all of its products. The _Salmonella_ outbreak has sickened 5 people, according to a notation in the weekly outbreak update from the Food and Drug Administration. The table does not reference the recalled Jule's Foods products. The CDC had not posted an outbreak notice.

"To date, FDA has preliminary confirmation of _Salmonella_ in brie products containing cashews. We are working with the FDA to isolate the source of the pathogen in samples, which were collected by the California Department of Public Health. Jule's Foods is issuing this recall in connection with a _Salmonella_ outbreak under investigation by the FDA and CDC," according to the Jule's company recall notice posted by the FDA. The California company has suspended operations while it assists the FDA with the investigation into the source of the contamination.

Jule's Foods distributed the recalled products primarily to independently owned grocery stores in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Texas as well as direct to consumers nationwide.

The company is urging consumers to check their homes for the products and throw them away or return them to the place of purchase. A full list of stores is available at <www.JulesFoods.net>.

Consumers can use the following information to determine whether they have the implicated products in their homes:

Jule's Cashew Brie (Classic) UPC: 860388001507 - all expiration dates
