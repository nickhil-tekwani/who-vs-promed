Ho Chi Minh City and the Mekong Delta are in the grip of a dengue fever
outbreak, with many hospitals overloaded with cases. HCMC Preventive Health
Department deputy director Nguyen Dac Tho said about 4000 cases of dengue
fever had been reported in the city in the 1st 6 months of the year [2008],
with about 100 new cases recorded every week. Thu Duc District has reported
the highest number of dengue fever cases, followed by districts 7, 8, and
Tan Phu, Tho said.

Dang Hai Dang, deputy director of Ca Mau Province Preventive Health
Department, said the number of patients with dengue fever in his province
over the past month [June 2008] was nearly double the number reported in
the 1st 5 months of this year [2008]. Tran Van Thoi District has been
hardest hit, with 600 cases reported so far this year [2008], followed by
the U Minh and Thoi Binh districts, and Ca Mau Town, he said. At the
Children's Emergency Department of Ca Mau General Hospital, 2 or 3 patients
share each bed.

The tropical disease, transmitted by the [_Aedes aegypti_] mosquito, has
claimed 4 lives in Ca Mau Province this year [2008]. Soc Trang Province has
the highest number of cases, with more than 1900 cases reported so far this
year [2008]. The provincial hospital's children department often struggles
to cope with the influx of dengue patients.

In Tien Giang Province, more than 1400 cases of the disease have been
reported this year [2008]. One death, a 7 year old boy, was also reported.

Between 300 and 700 cases each of dengue fever have been reported in the
Mekong Delta provinces of Dong Thap, Bac Lieu, Kien Giang, and Ben Tre.

Ho Chi Minh City's Pasteur Institute has run prevention and treatment
training courses for health officials from Soc Trang, Ca Mau, Bac Lieu, and
Hau Giang provinces. Ca Mau's health agency staff have been touring the
province to advise residents on how to prevent the disease. The health
departments of Soc Trang, Dong Thap, Kien Giang, and HCMC have launched
mosquito eradication programs.

Kuta has been hit by dengue fever; 15 of the 23 cases reported have been
laboratory confirmed.

An outbreak of dengue fever has become an epidemic in the Kundur North
subdistrict. In one month, 23 cases have been reported in the Karimun RSUD
(regional hospital), and 15 were said to be positive. Although the disease
caused no deaths, this outbreak made the community very anxious and more
careful. The intensity of the outbreak in the subdistrict has increased
over the last week. There have been 3 dengue foci in the Kundur North
Subdistrict, in the Urung, Urung Barat, and Sebele districts.

This is an extraordinary incident and must be dealt with by the community,
said Section Head Kesehatan of the Karimun Regency, Dr Cecep Yodiana. The
Kesehatan Service personally dropped the team off and took steps in
prevention and dengue eradication through giving abate [? - Mod.SH],
fumigation (fogging), and cleaning the environment, carried out by 3
services at the same time, including the Kesehatan Service, Kepala PMD and
Kesbang Isdianto, and the Pertamanan Service and the Safri Salisman trash
removal.

Ucayali 3 cases (6 per cent). The Loreto DIRESA has been on strike since EW
20, the reason for which has not been reported [which means that the actual
total numbers of dengue cases from the lowlands are underreported. - Mod.TY].

The cumulative national total of reported dengue cases is 8791 through EW
26 [2049 cases laboratory confirmed, and 4834 listed as probable]. Through

(69.3), Lambayeque (65.1), Piura I (69.4), Madre de Dios (45.2), Tumbes
