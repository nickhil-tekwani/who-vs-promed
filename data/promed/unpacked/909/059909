Physicians in Serbia`s Kosovo province on Friday [18 Aug 2006]
registered 18 new cases of meningitis, raising the number of people
stricken with the disease to 374. Ilir Begholi, Director of the
Kosovo Health Institute in Pristina, however, said the epidemic was
under control. Begholi said this was not the first time that Kosovo
faced a meningitis outbreak and added that his Institute had enough
doctors, equipment and medicine to deal with the disease, Belgrade's
Beta news agency reported.
Drinking water from village wells contaminated with waste is the most
frequent cause of meningitis outbreaks, Begholi said. Only about 40
percent of Kosovo's 1.8 million population use water from the main
water systems. Begholi said the institute has undertaken emergency
measures to prevent the spread of meningitis, which began early in July 2006.

[This outbreak is presumed to be an outbreak of aseptic (viral)
meningitis since about 60 percent of Kosovo's population do not have
access to a main water supply. A variety of enteroviruses have been
associated with outbreaks of aseptic meningitis, usually in
association with fecal contamination of sources of drinking water.
This report does not identify the particular virus or viruses
involved. No vaccines are available for prevention of infection by
viruses such as enterovirus 71 which have been associated frequently
with outbreaks of aseptic meningitis. The best protection is boiling
of drinking water and water used in the preparation of food. In the
longer term improvements in the supply of drinking water will be
required to provide adequate protection of the population of Kosovo.
