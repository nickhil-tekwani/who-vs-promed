Campinas (SP) officials confirmed on Monday, 6 Oct 2014, that 3 residents of the city had died of spotted fever, an infectious disease transmitted by star tick, between August and September of this year (2014). According to the City Health Department, the victims are men, and, in the meantime, there is no research about other deaths which may have the same cause. The number equals the total number of deaths in the past year (2013) and in 2012.

The 1st case recorded since January (2014) was a 12-year-old boy, who died on 22 Aug (2014) in the Southern region. According to the Mayor's office, he contracted the disease in Campinas and received treatment in a public hospital. The 2nd case, according to the text, occurred in the same region, and the victim was a 68-year-old man who died on 23 Aug (2014). It was reported in a medical unit in Campinas, however, that the probable site of infection is located in Valinhos (SP). In the 3rd case, the secretariat reported that the disease was contracted by a man of 54 years, a resident of the Northern region. The probable location of infection is in Campinas; however, the victim died in a public hospital in a nearby town according to the secretariat. The death occurred on 18 Sep 2014.

According to the City Hall, the Department of Health Surveillance after notifications made epidemiological interventions and undertook actions toward education and social mobilization in likely areas of infection. In 2013, the city totaled 8 cases of spotted fever, and 6 in 2012.

[The Rocky Mountain spotted fever rickettsia, _Rickettsia rickettsii_, is the cause of this illness, which is also referred to as febre maculosa, Sao Paulo exanthematic typhus, Minas Gerais exanthematic typhus, and Brazilian spotted fever. The organism, which is tickborne, is distributed through much of the USA, including the Rocky Mountains and also in parts of southern Canada, Central, and South America. It is vital to diagnose this rickettsial infection promptly to minimize morbidity and mortality. The number of non-fatal cases of the infection is not stated for 2014.

When the female tick harboring the organism attaches to a passing human, she usually starts low on the body after transferring from grassy vegetation or even directly or indirectly from a dog. After crawling around on clothes seeking an appropriate cutaneous site (wearing white clothes makes a wandering tick easier to spot), she attaches and begins to feed.

If not already partially fed, after attaching, it generally takes 24 hours to activate and transmit the rickettsial organism. For this reason, daily or twice daily tick checks with removal will minimize disease transmission. Ticks that attach in hairy areas such as the scalp or beard may be more difficult to find.

The incubation period of the disease is about a week after the tick exposure, long after the tick has detached. The presenting illness is generally nonspecific, with fever, muscle pains, and headache (but the headache is usually described as quite severe). The rash begins in day 3 of illness, initially maculopapular at the wrists and ankles before becoming petechial and purpuric, involving the palms and soles as well as spreading proximally to the truck. Purpura usually are not seen before the 6th day of illness. The mortality is indeed quite low if treatment (usually a tetracycline) is begun during the 1st 2 days of the rash or before.

Empiric treatment for this infection should always be started in people with compatible symptoms inhabiting endemic areas during the spring and summer, even if no tick bite is known.
