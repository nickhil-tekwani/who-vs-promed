Researchers in West Bengal have reported a 2nd strain of the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) circulating in the eastern Indian state.

According to a study published online in Virology Journal last month [15 Nov 2012, see reference, below], the researchers confirmed genotype I (GI) of JEV coexisting with the predominant genotype III (GIII) strain in over 1/4th of 135 patients hospitalised for acute encephalitis syndrome.

The GI strain was 1st detected in India 3 years ago in the Gorakhpur area of the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.

Led by Shyamalendu Chatterjee at the virus unit of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in Kolkata, the researchers have now confirmed the GI strain in the samples of blood and fluid from brain and spinal column of patients admitted to government hospitals in 8 West Bengal districts between July-December 2010.

JE, which causes brain fever, is rampant in West Bengal despite an active vaccination programme.

The ICMR scientists, who were joined by Subhra Kanti Mukhopadhyay from the microbiology department of the University of Burdwan, were unable to ascertain how the GI strain, earlier reported circulating in South Korea, Thailand and China, had reached India.

But, the researchers said the possibilities were that the GI strains were brought in by travellers, migratory birds (such as herons), or mosquitoes blown in by cyclonic winds. Domestic pigs are known reservoirs of JEV.

Transmitted to humans by [several species of] _Culex _ mosquitoes, the symptoms of JE include severe rigors, convulsions and high temperature. Patients may go into coma, and the fatality rate is high among child victims.

1st isolated in Japan in 1935, JEV has become a major public health menace with a worldwide case-fatality rate of 30 per cent, and 30-50 per cent of survivors develop permanent brain damage.

The isolation of the GI strain in West Bengal has cast doubts about the efficacy of vaccines currently used against JE derived from the GIII strain. "In future, a JE outbreak is quite likely in the state if this vaccine fails to protect sufficiently against GI of JEV," the researchers noted in their study.

Other experts said there was no cause for panic. "GIII-derived vaccine is used in countries where the GI strain is prevalent and has been found to be effective. I do not think there is any risk," Komal Kushwaha, a physician at the Baba Raghav Das Medical College in Gorakhpur, told SciDev.Net.

Kushwaha suggested carrying out a study by completely immunising one district and keeping another as control over a period of 2 years.

Abstract (provisional)

Background:
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a mosquito-borne zoonotic pathogen, is the sole etiologic agent of Japanese encephalitis (JE), a neurotropic killer disease which is one of the major causes of viral encephalitis worldwide, with prime public health concern. JE was 1st reported in the state of West Bengal, India in 1973. Since then, it has been reported every year from different districts of the state, although vaccination has already been done, indicating that there might be either partial coverage of the vaccine or the emergence of a mutated/new strain of JEV. To understand JEV genotype distribution, we conducted a molecular epidemiological study on a total of 135 serum/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples referred and/or collected from clinically suspected patients with acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) admitted in different district hospitals of West Bengal, India, 2010.

Findings:
JEV etiology was confirmed in 36/135 (26 per cent) and 13/61 (21 per cent) 2-15 day febrile illness samples from AES cases by analyzing Mac-ELISA followed by RT-PCR tests, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on complete envelope gene sequences of 13 isolates showed the emergence of JEV genotype I (GI) co-circulating with genotype III (GIII).

Conclusion:
This study represents the 1st report of JEV GI with GIII co-circulating in West Bengal. The efficacy of the vaccine (derived from the JEV GIII strain SA-14-14-2) to protect against emerging JEV GI needs careful evaluation. In future, a JE outbreak is quite likely in the state if this vaccine fails to protect sufficiently against GI of JEV.

[Travelers would not be the source of JEV GI in West Bengal state because viremias in humans are not adequate to infect mosquito vectors that would lead to ongoing virus transmission. It does seem unlikely that the JEV GIII vaccine would fail to protect people from JEV GI infection. Studies using animal models would confirm or discard effective cross-protection. It will be interesting to see which of these genotypes predominates in West Bengal over time and whether individuals who have been vaccinated recently with the GIII vaccine develop clinical disease from JEV infections. If protection is not adequate, the vaccination strategy in eastern India will need to be reevaluated.

Reports of the etiology of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in eastern India have been confusing. Some attribute all of the AES cases to JEV infection, others to a small proportion, or to none of them. This report confirms JEV as one of the etiological agents responsible for AES.
