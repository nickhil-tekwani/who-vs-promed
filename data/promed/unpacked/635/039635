Papua New Guinea's (PNG) Department of Agriculture and Livestock says there is an outbreak of anthrax in Madang. According to the Post Courier, the mysterious death of 600 pigs in the province in the past 2 months is being linked to anthrax.

The Deputy Director of the Department of Agriculture and Livestock, Godfrey Savi, issued a warning to all pig owners. He said if any pig owners see drooling, swollen necks, high fever, difficulty in breathing or sudden death, they must report this to the department.

For possible background interest, I summarised some research work on anthrax in pigs in New Guinea up to c. 2000 in:

11.2.2 Anthrax
--------------
"Following earlier reports of anthrax in New Guinea (Gee 1938; Australian Mobile Veterinary Survey Unit 1946), it was described in 1964 as widespread in the highlands, with a further enzootic area of about 100 sq mi [approx. 260 sq km] in the Lumi area of West Sepik Province, and unconfirmed reports from the Ramu River mouth in Madang Province (Egerton and Rothwell 1964; Egerton 1965a). Egerton described anthrax as probably the most important bacterial disease of animals in New Guinea. He noted that in enzootic areas there can be either an epizootic form, in which large numbers of pigs die, or individual cases. The epizootic form recurs at 3-5 year intervals, due to the development of herd immunity in a geographical area which lasts for approximately the life of a pig (ie 3-5 years).

"Egerton reported that highlanders usually ate pigs which died of anthrax, but that throughout the area, 'the infective nature of the disease is recognized and the affected head region is discarded'. Skin infection in humans has been diagnosed once in New Guinea, in a laboratory worker. This was presumably Egerton himself (Egerton 2003). In 1962-63, 4 cases of cutaneous anthrax were reported in native people in New Guinea' (Egerton 1965b:143), but not confirmed bacteriologically. See also Watt et al. (1975:68) and Nelson (1982a).

"During the 1960s there was a campaign to vaccinate pigs (in the highlands at least) against anthrax. In 1963-64 some 1531 pigs were vaccinated; in 1964-65 this rose to over 27 000, and in 1966 the target was 50 000 (Harvey 1966:67).

"Outbreaks or epidemics of anthrax and their effects on local pig herds have been widely reported by anthropologists and others in PNG:
- in the Enga Province in 1943-44 (Meggitt 1958a:288; 1974b:19)
- in the Southern Highlands around Tari in the early 1940s (Frankel 1986:26)
- later both on the Nembi Plateau in 1980 (Crittenden 1982:275) and in the Lake Kutubu area (Weiner 1988:32-4)
- in the Karimui area of south Simbu Province in 1982 (Hide et al. 1984:226)
- elsewhere in Simbu at various times (Hide 1981:163, 483; Schaefer 1991:120)
- at Oksapmin in West Sepik Province between 1974 and 1979 (Cape 1981)
- at Bundi in the Madang Province in 1988 (Caven and Gitai 1990a:22)
- in the Eastern Highlands Province, in the Arona Valley in 1948 (Du Toit 1975:97), around Lufa between 1948 and 1960 (Glick 1963:14), and in the Fore area in 1962 (Lindenbaum 1979:130).

"The only account from the lowlands is that from the Lumi area in West Sepik Province in 1968 (Lewis 1975:81-82).

"In Irian Jaya there were several outbreaks of suspected anthrax after 1956 in local pig populations but, despite the pigs displaying the clinical signs of anthrax, there was no confirmatory laboratory data. The disease reappeared between April 1983 and mid-1984 in the Paniai area, and 3484 pigs, as well as 49 people who had consumed the affected animals, died (Ronohardjo et al. 1984:238). Laboratory studies showed that anthrax was responsible. However, it has also been suggested that the human mortality may have been due to _Clostridium perfringens_ (Moekti et al. 1985)."

[Our thanks to Robin Hide for this useful summary of anthrax in PNG. Porcine anthrax has long been a problem in the PNG highlands, and usually accompanied by large numbers of animal deaths, as well as of humans attending community festivals. This time it is in a coastal town in NW PNG: see Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org /wiki/Madang. The possibility of associated human deaths in Madang from people eating these dead pigs is of great concern to the local authorities, and accounts for the publicity given to this situation.

As the pigs are dying of "mysterious deaths" the cause is still to be determined and laboratory confirmed. These deaths have been over a period of 2 months so one might expect that some carcasses have been submitted already for analysis & confirmation. Porcine anthrax differs from other livestock deaths by the lesions being commonly oropharyngeal, i.e. the head, neck, and throat are grossly inflamed. We are optimistic that this will be achieved in spite of the anthrax data being reported to OIE, Paris, are minimal ("+" and no species affected, outbreak numbers, nor cases) and the population numbers are static and repetitive. - Mod.MHJ
