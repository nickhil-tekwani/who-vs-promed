Health officials on Wednesday [22 Jun 2022] recommended that men in Florida who have sex with other men get a meningococcal vaccine following what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) called "one of the worst outbreaks of meningococcal disease among gay and bisexual men in US history". [https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/p0622-Meningococcal-Outbreak.html]

CDC said in a statement that at least 24 cases and 7 deaths among gay and bisexual men have been caused by the bacterium [_Neisseria meningitidis_] in Florida recently. CDC also recommended that gay and bisexual men traveling to Florida should ask their health care provider about getting the vaccine.

"Because of the outbreak in Florida, and the number of Pride events being held across the state in coming weeks, it's important that gay and bisexual men who live in Florida get vaccinated, and those traveling to Florida talk to their healthcare provider about getting a MenACWY vaccine," said Jos√© Romero, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.

Meningococcal disease is caused by a bacterium [_N. meningitidis_], and when the linings of the brain and spinal cord [the meninges] become infected, it is called meningitis. Meningococcal disease usually presents as an infection of meninges [meningitis] or a bloodstream infection [meningococcemia] about three to seven days after exposure, CDC said. Both are serious and can be deadly.

Symptoms [of meningococcal meningitis] usually include fever, headache, and stiff neck, and can sometimes include nausea, vomiting, and confusion. Meningococcal bloodstream infection damages the walls of the blood vessels and causes bleeding into the skin and organs. Possible symptoms include fever, chills, fatigue, vomiting, and diarrhea, cold hands and feet, severe aches, rapid breathing, and a dark purple rash. Meningococcal disease is treatable with antibiotics, but they must begin soon after symptoms begin, CDC says, as one to 2 in every 10 people who contract the disease die.

[Since 2001, clusters of invasive meningococcal disease (meningitis and bloodstream infection, that is, meningococcemia) among men who have sex with men (MSM) have been reported in cities in North America, Europe and Australia, associated with a high case fatality rate. All cases were caused by hypervirulent serogroup C strains of _Neisseria meningitidis_ (MenC) belonging to the sequence type (ST) 11 (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0160126).

The outbreaks of invasive meningococcal disease have occurred in Toronto (2001), Chicago (2003), New York (2010-13), Paris (2014), and Berlin (2012-13), Southern California (2012-16) and Victoria, Australia (2017). Currently, there is a large ongoing MenC outbreak among MSM in Florida. This outbreak in Florida is mostly affecting people who live in Florida, but also involves non-residents who had traveled to Florida (https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/outbreaks/FL2022.html#serogroup-c-outbreak). Increased international travel to attend large gatherings, in crowded venues, in the context of Gay Pride and other festivals may be factors facilitating the spread of the MenC invasive meningococcal disease among MSM, as it has monkeypox. Vaccination campaigns using a conjugate meningococcal C vaccine, such as MenACWY, in MSM with one dose (or a 2-dose series for people with HIV), at least 2 weeks before traveling, have been encouraged by the US CDC and European health authorities (https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/outbreaks/FL2022.html and https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/downloads/17-275138C1-MeningococcalDis-ACWY-Outbreak-FS.pdf).

Although _N. meningitidis_ normally colonize the mucosal surfaces of the nasopharynx, members of the meningococcal ST 11 clade have also genetically adapted to the urogenital tract, facilitating transmission via oro-genital sexual contact to cause outbreaks of meningococcal urethritis presenting at sexually transmitted infection clinics in multiple US cities in recent years (Ohio, California, Michigan, Indiana, Georgia, and other states) (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6521a5.htm and https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-018-4560-x). _N. meningitidis_ isolates from MSM with invasive meningococcal disease in Germany have been found to be genetically similar to _N. meningitidis_ strains from urethritis in MSM, suggesting that sexual transmission may be playing a role in the emergence of MenC disease among MSM (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4972413/).

Gram stained smears of urethral discharge appear identical in gonococcal and meningococcal urethritis. Meningococcal urethritis should be suspected if the gonococcal NAAT of the urethral discharge is negative (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/rr/rr7004a1.htm). Meningococcal urethritis is treated with the same antimicrobial regimens as gonococcal urethritis.

Although evidence is limited regarding the risk for sexual transmission or recurrent infections with meningococcal urethritis, treatment of sex partners of patients with meningococcal urethritis with the same antimicrobial regimens as for exposure to gonococcal infection can be considered (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/rr/rr7004a1.htm). - Mod.ML
