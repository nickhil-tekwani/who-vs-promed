Q-fever infections in Lunteren and Zuidermeer
---------------------------------------------
A total of 2 new farms have been declared to be infected with Q-fever.
This relates to a dairy goat farm in Lunteren (Gelderland province)
with approximately 1160 animals and a dairy goat farm in Zuidermeer,
in the North-Holland municipality of Koggenland with 850 animals. The
pregnant animals on the infected farms are to be culled.

There are currently 75 officially declared Q-fever infected dairy
farms in the Netherlands, 73 of goats and 2 of sheep. The Food and
Consumer Product Safety Authority (VWA) of the Ministry of Agriculture
put warning signs on the 2 new farms.

The Ministers of Health and Agriculture have sent letters with
information to all those living in the area of 5-km [3 mile] radius
around the 2 farms. For the Lunteren farm this relates to the
residents of the municipalities Barneveld, Ede, Renswoude,
Scherpenzeel and Veenendaal. For the farm in Zuidermeer, it concerns
the residents of the municipalities Koggenland, Beemster, Hoorn,
Medemblik and Opmeer.

A list of all Q-fever infected farms in the Netherlands, and a map,
are available on the web-site of the VWA.

[The farm in Koggenland is the 1st to be infected in the province of
North Holland; only 2 Dutch provinces, Friesland and Zeeland, now
remain free of Q fever in dairy goat or dairy sheep farms. The
authority's forecast was that up to a third of all such commercial
farms in the Netherlands may eventually be found infected, namely up
to 130 farms.

Since end December 2009, about 41 000 goats and sheep have been
culled. According to a recently cited statement by a researcher in the
Central Veterinary Institute, no culling will be necessary in 2011. -

the Dutch Parliament on the Q-fever situation, dated 16 Feb 2010.
[Trans. Mod.AS, summarised and edited].

[The letter included, inter alia, replies to queries from MP's
(members of Parliament). The following 6 replies have been selected
due to their significant additions to available information. - Mod.AS]

1. Information requested on the possible relationship between clusters
of sick people and non-dairy farms (including mutton-type sheep).

The information on possible role of mutton-sheep in human infection
will be forwarded to the House as soon as scientific advice is obtained.

2. Requested information concerning the updated policy of animal vaccination.

According to the published regulations, all goats and sheep present on
farms which are to be vaccinated compulsorily, should be vaccinated
before 1 Jan 2011. To make sure that such vaccination is performed
prior to gestation in milk-producing and breeding farms, the final
date in this category of farms has been modified, becoming 1 Jun 2010.

3. What is the Q fever situation in other [EU] Member States?

We refer you to the recent publication of the European Food Safety
Authority (EFSA), named 'THE COMMUNITY SUMMARY REPORT ON TRENDS AND
SOURCES OF ZOONOSES AND ZOONOTIC AGENTS AND FOOD-BORNE OUTBREAKS IN
THE EUROPEAN UNION IN 2008', which was published on 28 Jan 2010. The
report paid specific attention to Q fever and to the occurrence of the
bacterium in various member states
(<http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/scdocs/scdoc/1496.htm>). In addition,
the European Commission (EC) has requested EFSA to provide, in the
near future, scientific advice concerning Q fever. This advice will
cover the incidence of the disease in man and animal in Europe, a well
as the risk factors and the potential ways to control the disease.

4. In reply to a query on research and investigation during the
culling procedures:

Studies concerning the vaccine have shown that it reduces the
infection rate, abortion incidence and dissemination of the pathogen
by infected animals. At present, information is gathered by sampling
various tissues and organs, such as amniotic fluids and placentas from
the culled animals, which may come from vaccinated as well as from
unvaccinated farms. These samples will be tested for the presence of
the Q fever bacterium. This may provide knowledge concerning the
efficiency of the vaccine within the Dutch circumstances.

5. Regarding notified human cases of Q fever during 2010:

RIVM-Clb (The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment
-- Centre for Infectious Disease Control) has received since 1 Jan
2010, from 17 Municipal Health Services (GGD's), reports on 136 cases
of which the disease onset was between 2007 and early 2010. Doctors
and laboratories are officially obliged to notify each Q fever case.
In each case the GGD performs an investigation which includes contact
with the doctor or the patient, to clarify where and when the
infection had taken place. Of the 136 mentioned cases, it is known
that 11 became initially sick in 2010; 48 are known to have fallen ill
with the disease during 2009, 3 had their onset during 2008 and one
patient in 2007. No information on the date of onset is known
concerning the remaining 73 notifications.

In 2009, 6 patients were notified during the 1st 5 weeks, one of which
with onset in 2007, one in May 2008, 2 in November 2008, one in
December 2008 and one in January 2009. Since both physicians and
patients are currently more aware of the disease, RIVM-Clb expects an
increase in the number of notifications. If observed, it will be
investigated if such an increase reflects a higher disease incidence
or rather an enhanced notification rate. It is too early to make such
a judgement at the present point in time.

6. Concerning research on public health aspects of Q fever:

Current research is directed at risk factors for humans (in the
general population as well as in specific risk groups), at the impact
of infection upon pregnancy, at the development of better diagnostic
methods, at the identification of the most effective medical treatment
and at the impact of the disease on patients and upon society at large.

A case is notified by the GGD only if the diagnosis was confirmed by
laboratory test. Positive serological tests of persons who have not
(or had no) complaints, are not included in the notifications.

Most notified cases reside near infected dairy goat or dairy sheep
farms (less than 5 km). Other possible factors, such as profession or
recreation -- outdoor activities -- are under ongoing investigation.
Based upon currently available information fom the international
scientific literature, there is no evidence for a man-to-man infection
of significance. This aspect is not being investigated.

Various therapeutic treatments are being investigated by the medical
institutions and a hospital. A research project into the comparative
efficiency of the 2 main antibiotics currently in use, proposed by 2
hospitals, is under consideration.
