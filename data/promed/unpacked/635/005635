BRUCELLOSIS, CANINE - CHILE

We would like to post some questions regarding an outbreak of _Brucella
canis_ among dogs in a condominium in Santiago, Chile. This is the first
time we face this problem.
This is a community of 17 families (approximately 40 adults and 50
children) that live in a condominium in northern Santiago, Chile. A month
ago, 2 dogs in one household became sick and [were] taken to the
veterinarian. After a few lab tests and physical examination they
diagnosed brucellosis, as serological tests for _Brucella canis_ were
positive. The veterinary recommendation, which actually was followed, was
to sacrifice the dogs.
Further testing of 16 dogs living in the community showed 10 of them
positive for _Brucella canis_. There have been no cases of adults or
children presenting with symptoms that could suggest brucellosis; however
there is a big concern among families about children contracting the
disease considering the close contact they usually have with them.
We would appreciate input on how to manage this problem, estimation of risk
for humans, need of serological testing for humans contacts, advice on what
to do (treatment, evaluation, follow up) with serologically positive but
asymptomatic dogs and recommendations for further investigation of the
outbreak.
[It is very important to distinguish the genus and species causing human
brucellosis to evaluate the risk. Human infections due to _Brucella
abortus_, _B. melitensis_ or _B. suis_ (originating with farm animals) can
be severe and require strict measures for control. Although I must admit I
am not up to date on this subject, some time ago cases of _B. canis_ in
humans were rare, only 15 cases (8 of them originating in the laboratory)
between discovery of the organism in 1966 and 1979, when LE Carmichael
wrote his section in Jim Steele's CRC Handbook of the Zoonoses. More
importantly _B. canis_ caused a mild human disease which is easily
treatable with tetracycline. The disease was originally reported in kennel
dogs and control consisted of removing infected animals from the kennel.
Infected individuals can be identified with serological and bacteriological
tests. More definitive comments from anyone who has substantial experience
in such situations would be appreciated.
It appears that the condominium dog population may be large enough to
support ongoing transmission. I wonder if the condominium housing pattern
allowed a large enough population of dogs to live in close proximity and
therefore provide _B. canis_ with a new environment to exploit. - Mod.PC]
