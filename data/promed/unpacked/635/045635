World's Press Protests Against Jail Term for Chinese Journalist
-----------------------------------------------
The World Association of Newspapers and World Editors Forum have
protested to the Chinese government against the jailing of journalist
Li Changqing, who exposed an outbreak of dengue fever, a frequent
cause of hospitalization and death among children, before the
authorities officially announced it. "What makes the jailing of Mr.
Li even more heinous is that his disclosure of the outbreak of dengue
fever was clearly in the public interest," said the Paris-based WAN
and the WEF in a letter to Wang Xudong, Minister of Information Industry.
Mr. Li, a journalist with the Fuzhou Daily, was convicted on 24 Jan
2006 of "spreading false and alarmist information" and sentenced to 3
years in prison. The charges relate to an article Mr. Li published on
the banned US-based website Boxun News exposing the dengue outbreak.
"We are seriously concerned at the government's continuing campaign
to censor news and silence undesirable views on the internet: up to
86 other journalists and internet-users are reportedly detained in
China, more than in any other country in the world," said WAN and the
WEF, which called for the release of all jailed journalists.
The letter said:
"According to reports, on 24 Jan 2006 Mr. Li, a journalist with the
Fuzhou Daily, was jailed for 3 years by a court in Fuzhou for
"spreading false and alarmist information." The charges related to an
article Mr. Li published on the banned US-based website Boxun News
exposing an outbreak of dengue fever in Fujian province before the
authorities officially announced it. "Mr. Li was previously detained
in early 2005 after supporting whistleblower Huang Jingao. Mr. Huang
was sentenced to life in prison in November 2005 on corruption
charges, after he publicly exposed official misconduct in a letter to
the People's Daily newspaper.
"We are seriously concerned at the government's continuing campaign
to censor news and silence undesirable views on the internet: up to
86 other journalists and internet-users are reportedly detained in
China, more than in any other country in the world. What makes the
jailing of Mr. Li even more heinous is that his disclosure of the
outbreak of dengue fever was clearly in the public interest.
We respectfully remind you that the jailing of Mr. Li constitutes a
clear breach of his right to freedom of expression, which is
guaranteed by numerous international conventions, including the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Article 19 of the Declaration
states: 'Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression;
this right includes the freedom to hold opinions without interference
and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any
media, regardless of frontiers.'"

[According to a 14 Oct 2004 report from a Taiwan paper, the dengue
outbreak in Fujian (100 cases and some deaths) began in early
September 2004. We posted the official report from the 15 Oct 2004
China Daily (30 cases, no deaths) together with that Taiwan report on
20 Oct 2004. - Mod.JW]
[The ability to freely report outbreaks of infectious diseases is of
paramount importance to public health. ProMED has long stood for
transparency in the international communication of disease
information. - Mod.LM]
