["Small ruminants" generally refers to either sheep or goats. The upcoming
OIE weekly Disease Information on Friday (9 Sep 2005) will probably clarify
which species is involved. There seems to be a good bit of anthrax
reporting from the region. The references below indicate quite a bit of
activity last year (2004) in late summer as well. Anyone having more
information is encouraged to share it with us. - Mod.PC]
