Laboratory tests in this case of suspected Murray Valley encephalitis [MVE]
are NEGATIVE for both Murray Valley encephalitis virus and Kunjin virus. No
aetiologic agent has been found and the patient has made a full recovery.

Human cases of Murray Valley encephalitis acquired in the Northern
Territory are still likely to occur. Sentinel bird flocks in Tennant Creek,
Jabiru (near Kakadu National Park), and Nathan River (near Borroloola) have
seroconverted to Murray Valley encephalitis, and recent rainfall patterns
mean a heightened risk of human cases until July [2010].

Symptoms of Murray Valley encephalitis include fevers, confusion, seizures,
headache, and vomiting. Cranial nerve and lower motor neurone signs are
common. Diagnosis is made by detection of Murray Valley encephalitis virus
IgM in CSF [cerebrospinal fluid] specimens, and more recently through
molecular tests. MRI may demonstrate bilateral reduced signal in the
thalami on T1 axial images. Treatment is supportive. Although clinically
apparent infection is rare (as opposed to asymptomatic seroconversion), the
prognosis in hospitalised cases is poor.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Hajkowicz for this update that excludes MVE and
Kunjin viruses as the etiological agents in the case that was reported on
16 Apr 2010 (ProMED-mail archive no. 20100416.1227). These reports with
current results are especially valuable. If an etiologic agent involved
with this case is determined, that would be of interest.
