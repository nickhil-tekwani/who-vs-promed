An outbreak of infected tattoos in the Rochester area has been traced back to the ink. Health officials say they are seeing more cases of a nasty skin infection caused by a common bacteria traced to the ink. 19 people in Rochester ended up with rashes on new tattoos.

A report on this outbreak was published Wednesday [22 Aug 2012] by the New England Journal of Medicine [see moderator's comments below]. These infections were caused by bacteria common in tap water. In the past year, more than 50 confirmed or suspected cases were linked to tattoo ink or water used to dilute the ink. Health officials say tattoo artists and ink makers should only use sterile water.

Despite sterile techniques, the CDC and the New England Journal of Medicine reported today [23 Aug 2012] on small outbreaks of tattoo infections traced back to bacteria in the ink.

The New England Journal of Medicine [NEJM; the abstract of the NEJM article is extracted in ProMED-mail moderator's comments below] reports today that in recent months there have been outbreaks of a specific type of tattoo-related infection. The bacterium, a non-tuberculous mycobacterium (a relative of TB) has been traced to infected ink, not dirty needles or technique. Inks may pick up bacteria when they are diluted with tap water, or when needles are handled in non-sterile ways, and that's what they originally thought was happening. But it turns out that the bacteria have been found even in sealed ink containers, suggesting that tattoo ink production facilities may not always be the bastions of sterility we once presumed.

The FDA counts tattoo ink as a "cosmetic" and so requires that it be manufactured in a regulated environment. But it doesn't have the authority "to require premarketing submission of safety data from manufacturers, distributors, or marketers of cosmetic products." Most of their power is on the retroactive end -- to investigate, recall, and shut down. So the FDA's call right now is one for public awareness. People who get infected tattoos should go to MedWatch to report it so they can trace the contaminants back to their sources.

Infection with non-tuberculous mycobacterium isn't particularly aggressive or dangerous, but it can be difficult to diagnose and treat. It usually presents as red papules (pictured [see source URL]). Because it can be difficult to distinguish from an allergic reaction or other type of infection, and sometimes requires a skin biopsy to make the right diagnosis, people can get stuck living with it for months. Macrolide antibiotics have generally been effective, though, according to the NEJM [see abstract of the article extracted in ProMED-mail moderator's comments below].

To avoid infection, the recommendation is that we go to tattoo parlors that not only adhere to standards of sterility, but also "who can confirm that their inks have undergone a process that eliminates harmful microbial contaminants." There's not a specific stamp or seal that you can look for to prove that, though. Yet. So a quick way to think about it might be that if you walk into the establishment and the propriety of the term "parlor" feels ominously ironic, and they refuse to tell you where they got their ink or if it's clean, move on.

If you go through with it anyway, because maybe this tattoo just couldn't wait (sometimes sentimental appeal is time-sensitive -- it's only spring break once), and you do get an infection, report it so the outbreak can be traced and quelled.

[The news reports above refer to an article published in the current issue of the New England Journal of Medicine (Kennedy BS, Bedard B, Younge M, et al: Outbreak of _Mycobacterium chelonae_ Infection Associated with Tattoo Ink. N Engl J Med 2012; August 22, 2012; available at: http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1205114#t=article).

The article's abstract is extracted below and is also available at http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1205114#t=abstract.

"Background
-----------
In January 2012, on the basis of an initial report from a dermatologist, we began to investigate an outbreak of tattoo-associated _Mycobacterium chelonae_ skin and soft-tissue infections in Rochester, New York. The main goals were to identify the extent, cause, and form of transmission of the outbreak and to prevent further cases of infection.

Methods
-------
We analyzed data from structured interviews with the patients, histopathological testing of skin-biopsy specimens, acid-fast bacilli smears, and microbial cultures and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. We also performed DNA sequencing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), cultures of the ink and ingredients used in the preparation and packaging of the ink, assessment of source water and faucets at tattoo parlors, and investigation of the ink manufacturer.

Results
-------
Between October and December 2011, a persistent, raised, erythematous rash in the tattoo area developed in 19 persons (13 men and 6 women) within 3 weeks after they received a tattoo from a single artist who used premixed gray ink; the highest occurrence of tattooing and rash onset was in November (accounting for 15 and 12 patients, respectively). The average age of the patients was 35 years (range, 18 to 48). Skin-biopsy specimens, obtained from 17 patients, showed abnormalities in all 17, with _M. chelonae_ isolated from 14 and confirmed by means of DNA sequencing. PFGE analysis showed indistinguishable patterns in 11 clinical isolates and 1 of 3 unopened bottles of premixed ink. 18 of the 19 patients were treated with appropriate antibiotics, and their condition improved.

Conclusions
-----------
The premixed ink was the common source of infection in this outbreak. These findings led to a recall by the manufacturer."

This NEJM article may be a follow-up of an outbreak of non-tuberculosis mycobacterial infection associated with tattooing that the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was investigating and reported in a prior ProMED-mail post, Non-tuberculous mycobacteria - USA: tattoo, RFI 20120217.1043907.

_Mycobacterium chelonae_ is one of the non-tuberculous mycobacteria or NTM (that is, a grouping outside of the _M. tuberculosis_ complex) that is commonly found in municipal tap water. NTM are characterized on the basis of their rate of growth in vitro and pigment production. Organisms in the _Mycobacterium chelonae-abscessus_ group are non-pigmented, rapidly growing NTM species (RGM) that produce mature growth on agar plates within 7 days of incubation and include _M. fortuitum_ and the _M. chelonae-abscessus_ group.

Past outbreaks of non-tuberculous mycobacteria infection related to nosocomial and cosmetic procedures reported in the USA are summarized in a prior ProMED-mail post Non-tuberculous mycobacterium, nosocomial - China (02): background 20100128.0308. _Mycobacterium chelonae_ infection associated with tattooing could be caused by contamination of instruments or inks or other injected materials that are diluted with contaminated tap water in the tattooing parlor. However, in the outbreak above, the premixed ink in sealed containers was contaminated with _M. chelonae_, which suggests that tattoo ink production facilities were at fault.
