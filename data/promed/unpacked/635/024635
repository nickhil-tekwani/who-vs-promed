Warning issued about rabies after deaths of animals
---------------------------------------------------
Public health officials are warning people to protect themselves and
their pets from rabies after a rabid goat and a dead fox were found in
Cave Junction.

Oregon State University's Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory confirmed
the presence of rabies in the 2 animals. The goat died of exposure to
a bat strain of rabies, according to Belle Shepherd, Josephine
County's director of public health.

[The fox probably had fox rabies, and since the goat had bat rabies,
the goat did not get it from the fox. Rabid goats have been rarely
reported -- see the Texas report in 1999 and Arkansas in 2008 in the
ProMED archives listed below. - Mod.JW]

Rabies alert issued in Volusia County
-------------------------------------
The Volusia County Health Department has issued a rabies alert
following 3 unprovoked attacks on humans by raccoons last month
[January 2010]. This rabies alert is for 60 days.

The rabies alert area encompasses approximately 5 miles of the
peninsula beachside, including unincorporated Wilbur-by-the-Sea from
Dunlawton Avenue Bridge south to the southern limit of the Town of
Ponce Inlet.

Over a 5-day period, the raccoon attacks took place near the Dunlawton
Avenue Bridge and locations in Ponce Inlet and in Wilbur-by-the-Sea.
The raccoon from the Wilbur-by-the-Sea attack was the only one
captured and it tested positive for rabies.
