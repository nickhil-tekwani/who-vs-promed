Leishmaniasis in Mato Grosso do Sul
-----------------------------------
At least 25 cases of visceral leishmaniasis have been confirmed in Mato
Grosso do Sul this year, with at least six deaths. Nine cases were
diagnosed in the first 10 days of May.
The last case was fatal -- a 17 year old boy from the Santa Rita
neighborhood. His was the first death due to leishmaniasis reported in the
capital of the state, and this report increased to 12 the number of
municipalities with confirmed cases of the disease. The city most affected
is Tres Lagoas (340 km from Campo Grande, in the bordering area with Sao
Paulo), where 3 people have died of leishmaniasis this year. The other
deaths occurred in Ribas do Rio Pardo and in Corumba.
In 2001, there were 114 cases of visceral leishmaniasis with 9 deaths.
About 2 per cent of the diagnoses were confirmed by the Centre for Control
of Zoonoses of Campo Grande. The centre has confirmed leishmaniasis in 16.5
per cent of cases investigated in the first 3 months of 2002, which
indicates epidemic activity.

[The Leishmania species in Mato Grosso do Sul is _L.chagasi_ and the vector
is _Lutzomyia_ spp sand flies. The animal reservoirs include dogs, foxes,
and opossums. The number of cases is probably underestimated, but the case
fatality rate appears to be higher than in 2001. Informed comments on the
situation would be welcome. - Mod.EP]
