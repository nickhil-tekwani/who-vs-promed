Researchers find new patterns in pandemic H1N1 deaths
-----------------------------------------------------
Brazilian researchers have performed the 1st-ever autopsy study to
examine the precise causes of death in victims of pandemic influenza
(H1N1) 2009 virus infection. "The lack of information on the
pathophysiology of this novel disease is a limitation that prevents
better clinical management and hinders the development of a
therapeutic strategy," said lead author, Thais Mauad, MD, PhD,
associate professor of the Department of Pathology at Sao Paulo
University, in Brazil. The results of their study will be published
in the 1 Jan 2010 issue of the American Thoracic Society's American
Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine [abstract available
at <http://ajrccm.atsjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/181/1/72>].

The researchers examined 21 patients who had died in Sao Paulo with
confirmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection in July and August
2009. Most were between the ages of 30 and 59. They found that
three-quarters (76 percent) of the patients had underlying medical
conditions such as heart disease or cancer, but there was no clear
complicating medical condition in the remaining quarter. All
presented a progressive and rapidly fatal form of the disease.

While previous data have shown that most patients with a non-fatal
infection have fever, cough and achiness (myalgia), Dr Mauad noted
that "most patients with a fatal form of the disease presented with
difficulty breathing (dyspnea), with fever and myalgia being less
frequently present."

All patients died of severe acute lung injury, but there were 3
distinct patterns of the damage to their lungs, indicating that the
infection killed in distinct ways. "All patients have a picture of
acute lung injury," said Dr Mauad. "In some patients this is the
predominant pattern; in others, acute lung injury is associated with
necrotising bronchiolitis (NB); and in others there is a haemorrhagic pattern."

"Patients with NB are more likely to have a bacterial co-infection.
Patients with heart disease and cancer are more likely to have a
haemorrhagic condition in their lungs. It is important to bear in
mind that patients with underlying medical conditions must be
adequately monitored, since they are at greater risk of developing a
severe H1N1 infection," said Dr Mauad. In these patients, H1N1
infection may present as a potential fatal disease, requiring early
and prompt intensive care management, including protective
ventilation strategies and adequate haemodynamic management. "We
found that 38 percent of these patients had a bacterial infection
(bronchopneumonia). This has important consequences because these
patients need to receive antibiotic therapy, in addition to antiviral therapy."

The researchers also found evidence of an influenza-associated
'cytokine storm,' an aberrant immune response in the lungs of certain
individuals, which was almost certainly involved in the pathogenesis
in these fatal cases of the H1N1 infection. "[This] suggests that an
overly vigourous host inflammatory response triggered by the viral
infection may spill over to and damage lung tissue, thereby causing
acute lung injury and fatal respiratory failure," noted John Heffner,
MD, past president of the ATS [American Thoracic Society].

Further research is needed to understand precisely how and why
certain patients succumb to a fatal progression when infected with
the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. While most patients experience a mild
illness with no lasting effects, this research lays important
groundwork for future efforts by defining the histological patterns
associated with a fatal infection.

"We would like to deepen our efforts into the understanding of the
immune responses in cases of severe infection," said Dr Mauad. "This
could ultimately lead to new therapeutic approaches."

[These studies were undertaken to better determine the
pathophysiology of pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 virus infection and
to achieve better clinical management and development of a
therapeutic strategy. Evidence of an influenza-associated 'cytokine
storm,' an aberrant immune response in the lungs of certain
individuals, was almost certainly involved in the pathogenesis in
some fatal cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection.
