The regional surveillance authority has reported 4 trichinellosis
cases in the Altay Republic -- 3 cases from Ulaganskiy district and
one from Gorno-Altaysk city.

There were 5 outbreaks of trichinellosis in Altay during the last 25
years, whereas sporadic cases happen every year.

In 1985, 26 people out of 96 who had eaten the meat of a brown bear
became infected. 7 people became infected after eating a pet dog in
June 1997. In December of the same year 5 people out of 40 who had
eaten the meat of a brown bear became infected. In 2008, 34 people had
eaten an infected brown bear which resulted in 5 of them contracting
the infection. The last outbreak happened in 2010 when 9 people out of
56 became infected after eating smoked bear meat.

[We do not know the source of infection, but as the news article
points out, bear meat is a common source of infection in the area.
