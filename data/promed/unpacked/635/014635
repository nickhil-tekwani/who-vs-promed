"Mycotoxins and Public Health: A Review" by Curtis D. Malloy and John S.
Marr, J. Public Health Management Practice, 1997, (3), 61-69.
---------------------------------------
Among the plethora of papers in the medical literature, relatively few deal
with the role of mycotoxins and public health. Public health practitioners
gave only transient attention to mycotoxins as potentially important causes
of illnesin the 1960s when they were discovered, and scant attention in the
1970s despite the detection of other mycotoxins in food.
The objectives of the authors in their review were to: review the
historical and contemporary importance of mycotoxins; to identify
mycotoxins that may be of significant public health importance; to advocate
that public health professionals refocus concern on issues surrounding
mycotoxicoses; and to provide appropriate references and citations to
toxilogic and mycotoxic resources.
The word "mycotoxicosis" was proposed by Forjacs and Carll (1955) to
describe animal illness as a consequence of ingestion of moldy
fodder. Some fungi produce a single toxin, while others may produce many,
and different fungal genera may produce the same mycotoxin. Many genera,
including _Acremonium_, _Alternaria_, _Aspergillus_, _Claviceps_,
_Fusarium_, and _Penicillium_ produce mycotoxins. While the evidence in
the literature indicates that ingestion of moldy feed and fodder may be the
primary route leading to animal mycotoxicoses, airborne fungal spores and
infested/infected plant particulates may also induce disease leading to
death in animals and man.
Mallory and Marr list 8 categories of mycotoxin action in the review:
immunosuppression, myelosuppression, hepatoxicity, nephrotoxicity,
neurotoxicity, dermatotoxicity, estrogenicity, mutagenicity,
teratogenicity, and carcinogenicity. Moreover, mycotoxin metabolites
produced by some opportunistic fungi are known to further exacerbate
disease in immunocompromised hosts.
Commodities known to contain mycotoxins include cereals and grains and
products thereof, seeds and nuts, fruits and vegetables and products
thereof, milk and dairy products, spices and condiments, meat and meat
products, and others, including prepared baby foods. Clearly, mycotoxins
are common in most food supplies. Diagnostic tests (ELISA, RIA) capable of
detecting 0.1 ng/ml have been developed for specific mycotoxins, and
several commercial test kits are available.
Several mycotoxicoses of animals (e.g. equine leukoencephalomalacia [ELEM
in horses, porcine pulmonary edema [PPE in swine, and stachybotrytoxicosis
(in poultry, cattle, sheep, swine and sheep) are listed, and their
principal pathologies and distribution are described. Human mycotoxicoses
including aflatoxicosis (_Aspergillus_ spp.) and ergotism (_Claviceps_
spp.) are well known. At the time of publication (1997) several aflatoxins
(B1, G1, and M1) were known to be carcinogenic in animals, but only B1 was
carcinogenic in humans.
The review contains one chart (commodities shown to contain mycotoxins).
There are 4 figures: 2 describe animal mycotoxicoses and human
mycotoxicoses, their pathogens, pathologies, and distribution in the world.
A third describes an historical account of the occurrence of mycotoxins,
and the fourth provides evidence of carcinogenesis in humans and animals.
There are 2 figures. The first illustrates the distribution of major
mycotoxins (aflatoxins, deoxynivalenol, ergot, ochratoxin A, tremorgens,
and zearalenone) in field crops in the United States, and the second
illustrates structural formulae for aflatoxin M1, patulin, and
tricothecene. 49 references are provided.
The previous review of mycotoxicology was in 1977. Malloy and Marr in
their review have provided an assessment of the field of mycotoxicosis as
of 1997 and, in doing so, have provided a basis for continued research
leading to a better understanding of the role of mycotoxins in public
health. The authors conclude their review by stating that "It may be time
to work with allied fields to bring mycotoxins into the mainstream of
public health."

[I recommend Malloy and Marr's work as a good general review of the field
of mycotoxins. My only reservation, which does not detract from the work
of Malloy and Marr, is the state of the art in detecting mycotoxins. I
assume that there are concerted efforts to improve the sensitivity of
methods of detecting mycotoxins in food, feed, and fodder. - Mod.DH
