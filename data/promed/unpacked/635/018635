The outbreak of measles in the Kansas City area continues to grow and is now the 3rd largest in the United States this year [2014]. In a 14 Jul 2014 e-mail, the Missouri Department of Health confirmed 21 cases in the state. On that same day, the Kansas Department of Health reported 9 in the state. All 30 cases are linked and a part of the same outbreak.

Measles has spread beyond the Kansas City metro area to Sedgwick County and the city of Wichita. There have been 6 measles cases in that area, and all are linked to Kansas City. The 1st 2 patients were an unvaccinated adult and a child too young to be vaccinated, announced on 10 Jul 2014. On 12 Jul 2014, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment announced confirmation of 4 measles cases which are tied to Kansas City but apparently unrelated to the 1st 2 reported illnesses. Three adults working at a local steak house have contracted the disease, and an unvaccinated child exposed at the restaurant has also become ill. The growing number of measles cases in Kansas and Missouri places this outbreak 3rd nationally for 2014. Only an ongoing outbreak in Ohio and an outbreak early in the year [2014] in Southern California have had more cases.

In Ohio, public health workers continue to hold their breath as a 2nd week with no new measles cases passes. The total in the outbreak among Ohio's Amish community remains at 368 through 14 Jul 2014. Pam Palm, the press contact for the Knox County Health Department, told the Examiner on 10 Jul 2014 that 42 days without a new illness must pass before the outbreak is declared over. That deadline would be on or about 10 Aug 2014.

In the State of Washington, a measles outbreak within the Micronesian community of King County has resulted in 12 illnesses. Pierce County has reported 2 of the 12 measles cases. One patient was exposed in a hospital emergency department, and the other is a close contact of that patient. The 12 measles cases are part of a year-to-date total for Washington of 27 illnesses in at least 3 outbreaks.

On 14 Jul 2014, the Centers for Disease Control released their weekly report on the number of measles cases reported to them. In 2014 through 11 Jul 2014, the CDC has received reports of 566 confirmed cases of measles from 20 states. This is the highest number of reported illnesses since 1995, with the Ohio outbreak accounting for 66 percent of the total.

Kansas and Reno County health officials remain on the watch after a recent outbreak of measles. With 11 confirmed cases of measles in 2 counties, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment [KDHE] is still investigating possible leads on exposure points.

The KDHE communications director said the outbreak of the respiratory disease originated in the Kansas City metro area, where 3 cases have been confirmed in Johnson County. Belfry said officials are not exactly sure how the cases are linked to 8 confirmed cases in Sedgwick County, but they are related.

Earlier this week, officials linked the outbreak to 3 exposure points in Wichita: Sal's Japanese Steakhouse, 6829 E. Kellogg Drive; Sumo, 11233 E. 13th St.; and an informal softball tournament at South Lakes Softball Complex, 5300 S. Meridian, which took place on 4 Jul 2014. The tournament brought in 8 teams from Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri and Texas. Officials from KDHE and the Sedgwick County Health Department are working with health officials in Texas, Missouri and Nebraska.

Next Wednesday [23 Jul 2014], the department is hosting a back-to-school immunization clinic and offering extended hours from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. However, those interested in immunization can come in at any time or make an appointment. Typically, infants are immunized for measles, mumps and rubella after their 1st year and receive a booster before entering kindergarten.

[Due to the availability of the MMR vaccine, measles was all but eradicated in the United States. In 2000, the CDC declared the disease eliminated. However, a recent shift in some people's beliefs about vaccinations has led to some parents choosing against vaccination. As a result, the disease has again become a problem in the U.S. According to information from the CDC, there have been 566 confirmed cases and 18 outbreaks of measles across 20 states in 2014. In 2013, there were 11 outbreaks, with less than 200 cases total. In 2012, there were less than 100 confirmed cases in the U.S. However, in 2011 more than 200 cases were reported.

The end of Ohio's measles outbreak could be in sight; the last confirmed case was reported nearly 3 weeks ago. At the same time, the mumps outbreak in central Ohio continues to infect people.

The highly contagious measles virus has an incubation period that can last 21 days, and the last confirmed case was reported on 30 Jun 2014 in Holmes County. That means the outbreak could unofficially be over by 21 Jul 2014, said Brian Fowler, chief of vaccine-preventable-disease epidemiology at the Ohio Department of Health. However, the state won't consider the outbreak officially over until 2 incubation periods, or 42 consecutive days, have passed. That would make the official end date 11 Aug 2014 if no additional cases are confirmed.

Measles symptoms usually appear 7 to 21 days after exposure and include a fever followed by a cough, a runny nose and a red, blotchy rash on the face that spreads down the neck and body over several days. The disease is most contagious 4 days before and 4 days after the rash appears and can be deadly for babies and young children.

Measles cases are at a 20-year high in the United States, driven largely by the outbreak among unvaccinated Amish populations in Ohio. The outbreak's spread has leveled off at 368 reported cases with 10 hospitalizations in 9 counties: Ashland, Coshocton, Crawford, Highland, Holmes, Knox, Richland, Stark and Wayne. Knox County, where more than half of the cases have been reported, hasn't had a confirmed case since 11 Jun 2014. That makes the county's official end date 23 Jul 2014, said Pam Palm, spokeswoman for the health department there. The county, which has had 195 cases and 5 hospitalizations in its largely Amish population, has administered 1518 doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine since the outbreak started. "We were able to immunize about 30 or 40 percent of the Amish in the community and probably more in the Danville area where the majority of the people that had the measles were located," Palm said.

The number of measles cases in the Tyumen Region [Oblast] has increased over the last week and affected 47 people. They comprise 17 adults, including 4 older than 35, and 30 children. 4 of them children are under one year, and 16 children are aged from one year to 16 years. According to the Regional Centre for Surveillance of Measles (Novosibirsk), 39 are laboratory confirmed cases, and material from 3 patients is being genotyped by the National Centre for Surveillance of measles in Moscow. 4 patients are receiving treatment in an Infectious Diseases Hospital.

Measles is severe acute infectious viral disease and highly contagious. Measles is contracted via upper respiratory mucosa and conjunctiva, so runny nose, conjunctivitis, laryngitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia are common manifestations of measles, as well as the characteristic rash. Transmission is carried by droplets, a few days before the rash appears. At risk are persons without a history of measles and those who are inadequately immunised against measles. Such people are highly susceptible to measles throughout life and can develop it at any age.

The most effective and affordable way to prevent disease is vaccination. Routine immunization against measles has been held throughout Russia, including in the Tyumen Region, annually since 1968. Free vaccination against measles is provided by organizations of the state and municipal health care system in the community and workplace.

The Department of Public Health reports there is one confirmed case of measles in Guam. The patient is a 10-month-old child who has no travel history but has been linked to visitors from Pohnpei [Federated States of Micronesia].

Measles is highly contagious; it's spread by person-to-person contact via large respiratory droplets; symptoms include a rash lasting 3 days or longer, a fever of 101 F [38 C], coughing, runny nose or red eyes. If you are planning to travel to Pohnpei, for example to attend the 8th Micronesia Games, you are urged to make sure you are vaccinated for measles.

[The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) is an independent sovereign island nation consisting of 4 states -- from west to east, Yap, Chuuk, Pohnpei and Kosrae -- that are spread across the Western Pacific Ocean. Together, the states comprise around 607 islands (a combined land area of approximately 702 sq km or 271 sq miles) that cover a longitudinal distance of almost 2700 km (1678 miles) just north of the equator. They lie northeast of New Guinea, south of Guam and the Marianas, west of Nauru and the Marshall Islands, east of Palau and the Philippines, about 2900 km (1802 miles) north of eastern Australia and some 4000 km (2485 mi) southwest of the main islands of Hawaii.

While the FSM's total land area is quite small, it occupies more than 2 600 000 sq km (1 000 000 sq miles) of the Pacific Ocean. The capital is Palikir, located on Pohnpei Island, while the largest city is Weno, located in the Chuuk Atoll. Each of its 4 states is centered around one or more main high islands, and all but Kosrae include numerous outlying atolls. The Federated States of Micronesia is spread across part of the Caroline Islands in the wider region of Micronesia, which consists of thousands of small islands divided between several countries. The term Micronesia may refer to the Federated States or to the region as a whole. A map can be accessed at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_States_of_Micronesia. - Mod.CP]

Waikato District Health Board's Population Health service has to date been notified of 106 confirmed measles cases. Over a quarter of the confirmed cases are household contacts of a confirmed case and were already placed in quarantine before they were unwell. Approximately 80 per cent of the cases are aged between 10-20 years. The other 20 per cent are aged under 10 years and are close contacts of confirmed cases in quarantine as they were not vaccinated. Nine cases have been hospitalised but are now well.

Of the 106 cases, the vast majority are unimmunised; only 4 are fully immunised. Approximately 90 cases with a clinical illness like measles have been investigated and were found not to have measles.

There are currently no schools or child care centres with quarantine management in place.

A spokesman for ACT [Australian Capital Territory] Health confirmed a single case [of measles] on Friday [18 Jul 2014] evening and said more information should be available on Saturday.

The ACT acting chief health officer said members of the public could have been exposed to measles virus at Kaleen Plaza Shopping Centre and Kaleen Supabarn between 10 am and noon on Wednesday [16 Jul 2014]. "We're advising anyone who attended this shopping centre at these times to be aware for symptoms and to seek medical advice if they develop," Dr Pengilley said. Dr Pengilley said anyone with symptoms of measles should advise their health provider before they arrive at a medical clinic so infection control measures could be undertaken.

The recent confirmed case was the 3rd for the ACT this year [2014], after one in January 2014 and another in early February 2014. Before that, Canberra had not had a confirmed infection since 2011.

Health authorities have confirmed the 1st cases of measles in Tasmania in 5 years. A man in the state's south and a teenager in the northwest have both been isolated to minimise the chance of the virus spreading. "There are several other cases on which we're awaiting test results," said Director of Public Health Dr Roscoe Taylor. The Health Department has contacted more than 100 people it says are at risk of infection, and it believes several more cases are likely. The 2 confirmed cases are separate, and both people have recently travelled interstate or internationally.

After years without a case of measles in the state, Dr Taylor said it was unusual to have 2 separate cases occur at the same time. "Why, at this particular time of year? Where suddenly [there are] some cases, it makes me wonder whether or not there are some full-blown instances of transmission occurring elsewhere in the world," he said.

http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-07-17/measles-cases-in-victoria-hit-15-year-high/5604628


The number of measles cases in Victoria has hit a 15-year high, prompting an alert to general practitioners and hospital emergency departments. The health department says 57 people have been diagnosed with the highly infectious airborne illness since the start of the year [2014]. 16 new cases have been reported since 1 May 2014. Several children were so ill that they needed hospital treatment.

Two Melbourne health care workers have also been diagnosed with measles this week, and people who have returned from overseas travel have also been affected. "The last 2 years were quite low. In the equivalent time period, we had 6 reported last year [2013] and 11 reported in 2012," Chief Health Officer Dr Rosemary Lester said.

Hospital emergency departments and GPs have been advised to look out for symptoms, which include a rash, fever, severe cough and conjunctivitis. Dr Lester says "good immunisation coverage in our younger people" had helped control the spread of the illness. "It's very important that children be immunised on time," she said. Also, people who have a compromised immune system are at risk.
