Bovine spongiform encephalopathy [BSE], Poland
---------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 4 Feb 2019 from Dr Pawel Niemczuk, Chief Veterinary Officer, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, POL Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Varsovie, Poland

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 24 Jan 2019
Date of confirmation of the event: 31 Jan 2019
Report date: 4 Feb 2019
Reason for notification: recurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: March 2013
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: prion (atypical L-type BSE)
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Mirsk, Lwowek Slaski (0212), Dolnoslaskie
Date of start of the outbreak: 24 Jan 2019
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 50 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 2 / 0 / 0 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: [no information provided]
Epidemiological comments: The event concerns a case of atypical BSE (L-type). According to the OIE Terrestrial Code, for the purposes of official BSE risk status recognition, BSE excludes atypical BSE as a condition believed to occur spontaneously in all cattle populations at a very low rate. Therefore, this event does not have any influence on official BSE risk status recognition of Poland.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, traceability, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, disinfection, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
National Veterinary Research Institute (National laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / Western blot / 31 Jan 2019 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["Atypical BSE occurs rarely and spontaneously, typically in cattle that are 8 years old or older. There is no association of atypical BSE with contaminated feed or ingestion of infected materials. Instead, a spontaneous change in the prion proteins in older adult cattle cause atypical BSE. Because changes in prion proteins are sporadic and very rare, scientists do not fully understand what causes prions to change from normal to abnormal forms.

Scientists are currently studying whether genetics or environmental factors may contribute to atypical BSE. As part of this research, scientists typically examine the offspring of animals diagnosed with atypical BSE and animals born in the same location at the same time as affected animals."

Cases of atypical BSE do not impact the official BSE risk status of a country, and, therefore, this detection will not change the negligible risk status of Poland. - Mod.CRD
