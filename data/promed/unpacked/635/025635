Outbreak of Poliomyelitis - Angola, 1999
------------------------------------------------
On March 23, 1999, the Pediatric Hospital in Luanda, Angola, reported
21 cases (three deaths) of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP). By April 3, 102
AFP cases had been reported in Luanda and neighboring areas of Bengo
province.
A preliminary investigation by the Ministry of Health (MOH)
indicated that these cases primarily occurred among children aged [less
than 5 years; 90% had received two or fewer doses of oral poliovirus
vaccine (OPV), 4% had received three doses, and 6% had received four
doses. Many case-patients resided in overcrowded municipalities where
families displaced by civil war had settled. On the basis of preliminary
data, MOH suspected the outbreak was poliomyelitis and began
planning a vaccination campaign to control the epidemic. Surveillance
was strengthened to identify and rapidly investigate reports of AFP
cases to determine the extent of the outbreak.
On April 8, the National Institute of Virology in South Africa isolated
wild poliovirus type 3 from 11 (50%) of 22 stool specimens from AFP
cases submitted by MOH.
By April 11, the number of AFP cases increased to 276 (19 deaths). By
April 25, 634 AFP cases (39 deaths) were reported. Field investigations
confirmed two cases of AFP in children aged [less than 5 years in
Benguela, a city approximately 300 miles (480 km) south of Luanda. On
April 17 and 18, a mass vaccination campaign was carried out targeting
526,036 children. OPV was administered to 634,368 children aged [less
than 5 years in Luanda and the rest of the province. A World Health
Organization (WHO) team is assisting with the investigation of the
outbreak. Three rounds of National Immunization Days (NIDs) at
monthly intervals are planned to begin in July.
[MMWR Editorial Note: The outbreak in Angola represents one of the
largest epidemics of poliovirus type 3 in the vaccine era and one of the
largest polio epidemics recorded in Africa. Preliminary data from the
investigation suggest that the outbreak primarily resulted from failure
to vaccinate, with a high proportion (approximately 90%) of
case-patients being unvaccinated or partially vaccinated (three or fewer
doses of OPV).
With the intensification of civil war at the end of 1998, large groups
of displaced persons moved from areas where vaccination services had
been suboptimal to the capital, Luanda, and other cities. Sub-National
Immunization Days (SNIDs) were conducted in national and provincial
capitals of Angola in 1996, and NIDs were conducted in districts under
government control: 147 (89%) of 165 districts in 1997, and 121 (73%)
of 165 districts in 1998. Excluding districts not under government
control from the denominator, [equal to or greater than 90% coverage
was obtained in each round of NIDs. Estimated vaccination coverage
for the 1998 NIDs was [less than 50% in three of Angola's 18 provinces.
Displaced persons settled in crowded areas where sanitation is poor and
water supply inadequate and created an ideal environment for the spread
of poliovirus.
***Movement of refugees out of the country increases the
probability that the epidemic will spread into neighboring countries,
some of which have been reporting no cases of polio. These countries
have been informed and are increasing surveillance in border zones and
developing plans to vaccinate refugee children from Angola.***
[*** added - Mod.JW
Travelers to Angola are advised to review their polio vaccination
history to ensure that they have received a complete primary series of
three doses before initiating travel. In addition, travelers who already
have received a complete primary series should receive an additional
dose of either inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) or OPV before
leaving for Angola. If there is insufficient time before travel to
administer a three-dose primary vaccination series, then travelers
should receive a minimum of a dose of either IPV or OPV, depending
on age and vaccination history.
[***Note: the above applies to adults as well as children - Mod.JW
To achieve the target of polio eradication by 2000, implementation of
polio eradication strategies in Angola needs to be accelerated and to
reach all areas of the country, including those not under government
control. The planned three rounds of NIDs during July-September are a
significant step in this direction, but success will depend on achieving
high vaccination coverage levels in all areas of the country. In Angola
and other countries in conflict, reaching agreements for cease fires to
carry out vaccination campaigns for polio eradication are becoming
increasingly urgent.
