This pandemic will eventually be over, and the delta surge -- in which most of those not yet vaccinated against the coronavirus could become infected -- may well be America's last destructive wave. But just because we're eager to move past the virus doesn't mean it's finished with us.

In our large, open, and globally connected society, getting to zero COVID, the goal that Australia and New Zealand have pursued, is as politically unrealistic as it is biologically implausible. Americans are mostly done with the onerous shutdowns that such a goal would require. The virus has now spread so widely in the world that even tight, long-lasting limits on Americans' movement -- restrictions far beyond what we would tolerate -- could not stamp it out entirely. Instead, SARS-CoV-2 will become an endemic virus, settling alongside the other 4 strains of coronaviruses that circulate widely among us.

But while the other 4 coronaviruses typically cause little more than the common cold, SARS-CoV-2 is likely to remain a more serious threat even after this pandemic wanes, even after the virus becomes primarily a seasonal pathogen, even after drugs and vaccination limit the damage it does. The virus will become a persistent menace at least on par with the yearly flu -- a threat that, though seemingly routine, strains healthcare systems, businesses, and schools every winter. With SARS-CoV-2 mingling alongside influenza -- and causing a comparable level of death and disease -- the harm to public health and economic productivity will be too great for society to simply shrug off. The dual viral threat will compel better defenses. We won't have a choice.

The biggest challenge in confronting the coronavirus's continual threat will be adapting our work and leisure activities to turn an omnipresent virus into a manageable risk -- and seeing whether enough Americans can reach a political consensus on the practical and cultural changes that this will require.

The current pandemic has become a source of political division, and decisions about how to handle it have been evaluated through that prism. State-by-state differences in pandemic policy, and in residents' openness to vaccination, have produced regional variations in the scope of the epidemic. But the political coloring of disease-fighting precautions may fade as COVID-19 becomes a forever problem, and as the need for a sustainable long-term plan to address the continued threat becomes evident.

The impact on productivity alone will demand that schools and businesses strengthen their defenses against respiratory viruses. A 2018 study in the journal Vaccine estimated that the economic cost of flu tops USD 11 billion a year, including the indirect costs from lost productivity. That figure may be conservative; other models have put the total burden as high as USD 87 billion. Past surveys have estimated the mean number of workdays lost from flu to be 3.7-5.9 days per diagnosed episode. Meanwhile, the cumulative annual impact from severe colds and other non-influenza viral respiratory infections stands at about USD 40 billion.

Reducing these threats starts with more aggressive efforts to get people vaccinated for flu and COVID alike. Work-related vaccination mandates for both diseases will become more common. (By way of disclosure, I should note that I serve on Pfizer's board of directors.) For people in industries where telecommuting is possible, the calculus around going to work in person could also change. During peak flu and COVID season, businesses could encourage telework to reduce density in their offices. Conferences may be shifted to months when respiratory pathogens are less prevalent. Businesses will make wider use of videoconferencing to avoid crowded conference rooms, even holding Zoom meetings inside the office while people stay at their own desk.

In the past, responsible businesses have encouraged people to stay home if they're not feeling well. That should be extended to include people with a sick family member and those awaiting a firm diagnosis. Discouraging people from toughing out a cold at work should make the office safer from large outbreaks of respiratory viruses. We need to have workplace policies that insulate people from the financial impact of these prudent healthcare practices, as well.

Buildings will also undergo renovations to improve airflow and filtration in order to reduce the spread of aerosols. Modern buildings are sealed tight, sometimes as part of an attempt to make them greener. Now they should go blue -- improving airflow and air quality by adding hospital-grade air-handling and -filtration systems.

Medical practice will also change. Past work with other viral diseases suggests that we can successfully make drugs to combat the basic features that SARS-CoV-2 uses to reproduce and spread. If these efforts are any guide, we'll eventually have an antiviral drug that can be taken by mouth when people are first diagnosed with COVID, to reduce symptoms or prevent progression to severe disease. The same drug might be used to prevent infection if you've been in close contact with someone who is sick.

As with Tamiflu, an antiviral drug for influenza, drugs for COVID will reduce but not eliminate its risk. A key to controlling spread, and seeking timely care, will be prompt diagnosis. Home screening with tests that can differentiate flu from COVID will be routine. Regulators, who for years discouraged home diagnosis of infectious diseases with self-administered tests, now support this approach. Patients will self-diagnose at home and consult doctors through virtual visits. Personal hygiene will also change. During the winter months, when the spread of respiratory pathogens peaks, voluntary mask use inside public spaces will become more common -- and, in some parts of the country, a cultural norm.

These tactics will only partially interrupt a virus like SARS-CoV-2, which spreads before people have symptoms and can disperse long distances in poorly ventilated spaces. But they could have a greater impact on the spread of a virus like influenza, reducing the impact of flu enough that the cumulative threat from these 2 pathogens becomes a burden more comparable to that of a bad flu season like the winter of 2018.

We're not going to annihilate COVID. Instead, our goal must be to weaken its punch so that it becomes a risk we can adapt to. The key measure should be the burden of serious disease. Eventually, many of us are likely to get infected with SARS-CoV-2. For most of us, the hope should be that we manifest nothing more than a mild infection and are protected through vaccines. Once a shot becomes available for children under the age of 12, it will reduce some of the understandable anxiety that parents harbor about bringing the infection into their home and to their young children. Many concerns about in-person activities in the workplace may ease as well.

As we transition from the pandemic to the endemic phase of this virus, no bright line divides these 2 states. We'll straddle the 2 phases through this coming winter. Our progress will feel uncertain and disorderly because people will arrive at different estimates about how much of a threat COVID poses to them personally, and will feel different levels of resolve about how aggressively our society should try to confront it. Yet more widespread adoption of vaccines will provide Americans with growing confidence to take risks, and lower disease prevalence once the delta wave has passed will reduce many Americans' sense of pervasive danger.

During the shift from a pandemic emergency to an endemic hazard, fights over how forcefully we deal with COVID's acute risk will morph into debates over how we adjust society to reduce the virus's persistent perils. The twin burden of flu and COVID is going to compel more collective action. We've been far too complacent about the seasonal flu, allowing it to sicken and kill too many people each year. With a 2nd serious disease in the picture, we're going to be forced to take action.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction
------------
A "3rd wave" of the pandemic has arrived in Europe. The delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 is now widespread. Relaxations in pandemic control measures have been accompanied by surges in cases (1) [see source URL for complete references]. Concerns we reported ahead of the 2nd wave are still relevant today, conveying a sense of deja vu on last year's [2020] concerns and recommendations (2). Scientific knowledge is incomplete, and we cannot yet appreciate the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 on human and animal health, and on social and environmental conditions. How countries collectively respond will determine which road the pandemic takes, and how well we can control the pandemic in Europe and globally (3).

ASPHER believes countries must
------------------------------
1. Address the uncontrolled spread of infections
We are not achieving population "herd" immunity at current levels of vaccine coverage. It is reckless to assume we can open up society and remain shielded from the worst effects of the virus. Allowing further uncontrolled spread of the virus creates opportunities for further variants of concern to emerge, at least one of which will be vaccine resistant (3).

Priority must be given to expanding genetic sequencing to detect virus mutations, with internationally agreed standards and shared resources and support (3). Continued social distancing measures and wearing of face masks is necessary irrespective of vaccination status (4). Improving the effectiveness of contact tracing and financial support for self-isolation is needed (5).

Countries should critically review their policies with regard to mass gatherings, learning from previous experience of superspreading events (6) and evaluation of the experience of the Euros 2020. EU institutions should agree a strong common European policy on border controls, harmonized and effectively implemented by each Member State (3).

2. Recognise the increasing range of clinical presentations
There is widespread under-ascertainment of cases of COVID-19 infection and a high frequency of asymptomatic infection (3). Testing for COVID-19 needs be extended to a broader range of suspicious symptoms. The public needs to recognize the widening range of symptoms of COVID-19 and why they should be tested, even if their symptoms are mild (3).

3. Recognise and address the widening range of syndromes and clinical consequences of "long COVID," "persistent COVID" and COVID-related medical conditions
Healthcare services must prepare to respond to COVID-19-associated medical conditions (3). Enhanced surveillance is needed for COVID-19 sequelae and COVID-associated medical conditions. There should be an international agreement on categories of long COVID manifestations and a surveillance system implemented (3).

4. Rethink inadequate testing tools and strategies and improve public understanding of the limits of tests
The systematic replacement of PCR tests by rapid tests has increased the risk of false negatives making it difficult to control transmission. Governments need to see testing as part of the toolbox for reducing transmission but recognise its limitations and convey accurate information the general public (3).

5. Continue to implement mass vaccination and consistent equitable coverage of their population
Countries must improve vaccination coverage rapidly. They must strengthen efforts to address vaccine hesitancy (7). Continued vigilance in surveillance of vaccine efficacy is needed. Countries must ensure that vaccines are distributed equitably in their communities, and internationally (8).

6. Address unmet healthcare needs
Countries still need to address unrecognised, untreated or uncontrolled long-term conditions and conditions requiring surgery during the pandemic. Health services must take advantage where there is a decrease in COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalisation to address the backlog in regular care. Governments must resist relaxations which risk an increase in COVID-19 hospital bed-occupancy and prevent any recovery in routine and emergency care (2).

7. Plan for winter
In addition to planning for COVID-19, countries must plan for a major flu outbreak this year [2021]. Flu was greatly suppressed during 2020, through high flu vaccination rates, social distancing and mask wearing. These will have impacted on transmission of any respiratory viruses and are still needed in 2021 (9).

Enhanced influenza, pneumococcal vaccine programmes and vitamin D supplementation also need to be implemented (2). Countries should prepare for a cold winter (2), and for extreme and unpredictable weather events, like those happening with flash floods in Europe and with the extreme heat dome over the North Western Pacific region (10).

Efforts to stimulate economies by reducing societal COVID-19 restrictions will fail if the virus is not suppressed to very low levels (11). Countries must protect the health and the social welfare of all their people (2,3). Countries must protect their children's future; keeping schools open should be the priority (12,13).

8. Appreciate their global responsibility to all other nations of the world
We will not be free of the pandemic until we are all free of it (14). It is grossly irresponsible for any country to abandon all public health and social protection measures. It is an action, not confined to their own borders. It will have wide-ranging impact across the globe and weaken global efforts to suppress the virus (15). The possibility of perpetual COVID remains real (16).

9. Earn the trust of your people, govern by informed consent and support communities and individuals
Communication strategies must change from the message of protecting the health system capacity and the lives of older individuals, to protecting young individual's health over the long term due to the risk of long COVID-19 sequelae (3). Some of the new SARS-CoV-2 variants will have an impact on the effectiveness of vaccines and put in jeopardy the huge vaccination efforts that have been made. This will have consequences for public trust and vaccine confidence.

Communication of the medium-term risks is essential for people to understand and give their support preventive efforts. Our governments and public health experts must earn the trust of the public we serve, and consent to the measures which must be implemented (2,3). Our messages must be clear, consistent and unequivocal. We can be optimistic, but we cannot be complacent in our efforts towards the end of this pandemic.

[2] USA: COVID-19 in children
Date: Tue 14 Sep 2021
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/09/kids-covid-19-cases-continue-rise-us


The American Academy of Pediatrics' (AAP's) latest numbers on US pediatric COVID-19 cases once again show a significant rise in confirmed cases in patients under 18. More than 243 000 child COVID-19 cases were reported from 2-9 Sep 2021, representing 28.9% of weekly reported US COVID-19 cases, the 2nd highest weekly total for pediatric cases in the pandemic.

"After declining in early summer, child cases have increased exponentially, with nearly 500 000 cases in the past 2 weeks," the AAP said. Children represent 15.5% of all US COVID-19 cases. The 7-day average of new daily US COVID-19 cases is 164 475, according to the Washington Post tracker (https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?itid=hp_pandemic). Yesterday [13 Sep 2021], the country recorded 172 404 cases, including 1827 deaths according to the New York Times tracker (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html).

By today [14 Sep 2021], almost all public and private grade and high schools in the country have resumed in-person learning, but only adolescents ages 12 and older are eligible for COVID-19 vaccines. The AAP, along with other health associations, has requested that the Food and Drug Administration authorize vaccine use in younger children as soon as possible.

Southern ICUs fill
------------------
In Alabama, all intensive care unit (ICU) beds are occupied. Texas has only 700 ICU beds left. And more than 20 Florida hospitals reported that ICU patients have outnumbered beds in the past week. One in 4 hospitals in the South now reports more than 95% of ICU beds occupied, up from 1 in 5 last month [August 2021], the New York Times reports (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/09/14/us/covid-hospital-icu-south.html).

Southern states were the hardest hit in this summer's surge of virus activity, due in part to low vaccination coverage in many counties. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published last week showed that unvaccinated Americans are 10 times more likely to be hospitalized for COVID-19 than are vaccinated Americans (https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/09/covid-19-vaccines-protect-against-severe-illness-during-delta).

The CDC COVID Data Tracker shows 53.9% of Americans are fully vaccinated, and 63.2% have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total).

Medical professionals support boosters
--------------------------------------
A new Medscape poll shows that 71% of US physicians and 66% of nurses believe available evidence supports a booster shot for people who've already had 2 doses of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines.

This is in direct contrast to an editorial published yesterday [13 Sep 2021] in The Lancet, which suggested there is not enough evidence for boosters, and vaccinating the world's unvaccinated population is a better use of resources to end the pandemic (https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/09/global-experts-pan-wider-use-covid-vaccine-booster-dose).

In the Medscape poll, there was considerable difference among older and younger respondents: 74% of physicians and 70% of nurses aged 55 and older said they believed the evidence supports boosters. Only 61% of doctors and 56% of nurses under 55 agreed.

Other US developments
---------------------
- Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is threatening to fine local governments that require their employees to get the COVID-19 vaccine, the Associated Press reports (https://apnews.com/article/business-health-florida-coronavirus-pandemic-orlando-a9d617e07e16445108aeb3bfa1bf4752).
- A federal judge on Monday [13 Sep 2021] issued a temporary restraining order on Iowa's law that bars schools from requiring masks, according to Axios (https://www.axios.com/federal-judge-order-iowa-mask-ban-b60e1e9f-84bf-4b6a-b8f5-1d91d58271fb.html).
- New York City on Monday [13 Sep 2021] began enforcing its vaccination requirements for restaurant patrons and employees, the Wall Street Journal reports (https://www.wsj.com/articles/nycs-vaccination-proof-mandate-for-restaurants-and-dining-what-to-know-11631540546).

[3] Autoantibodies
Date: Tue 14 Sep 2021

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/09/covid-19-scan-sep-14-2021


Hospitalized COVID-19 patients were more likely to have autoantibodies, or self-attacking antibodies, than those without COVID-19, according to a study today [14 Sep 2021] in Nature Communications (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25509-3).

The researchers looked at March and April 2020 blood samples from 147 COVID-19 patients at Stanford-affiliated hospitals, as well as 48 patients from Kaiser Permanente in California, although most of the study's assessments didn't involve the whole cohort. By using 3 protein arrays to look at immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies, the researchers found that about 50% of patients had autoantibodies compared with less than 15% of samples from healthy controls collected pre-pandemic from donors. Longitudinal analysis from 48 patients also showed that about 20% of patients had new autoantibodies within a week of COVID-19 hospitalization.

Data indicated that antibodies recognizing nonstructural COVID-19 proteins were positively correlated with autoantibodies and that autoantibodies were produced out of proportion to the total IgG serum concentration. Also, in most people, only a small number of autoantigens were targeted.

Some of the autoantibodies have also been seen in relatively rare connective tissue diseases and are not typically measured. Others were anti-cytokine antibodies (ACAs) that the researchers say may have been triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection or an inflammatory immune response to it; about 60% to 80% of the cohort had at least one ACA.

"It's possible that, in the course of a poorly controlled SARS-CoV-2 infection -- in which the virus hangs around for too long while an intensifying immune response continues to break viral particles into pieces -- the immune system sees bits and pieces of the virus that it hadn't previously seen," said senior author PJ Utz, MD, in a Stanford Medicine press release (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/928260). "If any of these viral pieces too closely resemble one of our own proteins, this could trigger autoantibody production." Vaccinations, he adds, cause significantly less inflammation in patients than SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Gabon may have had lower COVID-19 severity, analysis suggests
-------------------------------------------------------------
An analysis of the single hospital treating COVID-19 patients in Gabon showed that from March to June 2020, 62.6% of patients were asymptomatic, 33.7% had mild symptoms, and 3.7% had severe illness, according to a study today [14 Sep 2021] in JAMA Network Open (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784059). The mortality rate was 1.4%.

By the end of the study period, the researchers say 3463 patients in the country had COVID-19, but the study consisted only of the 837 admitted to the Armed Forces Hospital in Libreville, Gabon. Most (68.3%) were men, and the median age was 35 years. COVID-19 severity was associated with older age (mean age 46.1 years vs 41.3, but 35.7 years in mild and asymptomatic cases). Diabetes was also seen more frequently in patients with severe COVID-19 (16.1% of 31), compared with patients with mild (3.9% of 282) or asymptomatic illness (0.9% of 524).

Flulike symptoms were more common in patients with mild symptoms (20.2%) than in patients with severe symptoms (0%) or those who were asymptomatic (0%). Also, while there was no significant difference between men's and women's advanced thoracic computed tomography scores for stages I to III, men were more likely to have a stage IV score than women (6.7% of 193 vs 1.0% of 196; odds ratio, 6.9).

The researchers suggest that the lower rates of severe illness may be due to the country's smaller number of older and more vulnerable people. However, as a related commentary by Igho Ofotokun, MD, and Anandi N. Sheth, MD, points out, these findings must be taken into context with its early timeframe in the pandemic, the country's limited COVID-19 testing, and the study's single-site design (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784063). "The silver lining in this report and the African COVID-19 experience is that the window of opportunity still exists to protect one of the most vulnerable regions of the world from the catastrophes of this pandemic through massive and rapid vaccination," Ofotokun and Sheth conclude.
