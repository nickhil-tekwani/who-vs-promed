A total of 22 people are confirmed to be infected with the deadly anthrax bacterium. The Ministry of Health and Social Services have embarked on a mass campaign to create awareness about the disease and warn people to be on the lookout for symptoms. The disease broke out on 17 Jan 2013 in the Oniipa Constituency in the Oshikoto Region.

Dr Norbert Forster, the deputy permanent secretary in the Ministry of Health and Social Services, yesterday [27 Jan 2013] said the 2 people who had died had both eaten anthrax-infected beef. According to him, the other 22 cases involve people who touched infected meat or the skin of the animals. As a result, they suffer from skin rash and have blisters. They are all treated with antibiotics "and they're doing fine," he said.

Forster warned residents of the area to report animals that die to the department of veterinary services. "They should not slaughter and eat the animals." It is understood that about 10 cattle were infected with the disease.

Andrew Ndishishi, the permanent secretary [PS], says anthrax is usually a fatal animal disease caused by a bacterium. "Anthrax in animals is endemic in the Etosha National Park and occurs from time to time in all regions bordering Etosha." Humans, Ndishishi says, can become infected if in contact with sick or dead animals and may die if not treated early with antibiotics.

Most people present with skin infection -- itching of the infected area, then blisters and later a black crust. Those who eat an infected animal suffer from nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, the PS said. Those patients with a lung infection suffer from coughing, difficulty breathing, and a high fever.

Ndishishi called on people who show these symptoms to report to a health facility immediately. "All persons who might have visited the Oshikoto Region during December [2012]-January [2013] and experience such symptoms, should report to the nearest health facility." He stressed that prevention of human infection starts with prevention in animals. Therefore, he said, animals need to be vaccinated and carcasses need to be correctly disposed of.

Infected patients are isolated and treated with antibiotics. "Mass vaccination and quarantine of humans is not recommended."

[The wildlife in African national parks are all at risk from anthrax, and because the park boundaries are porous, the result is that neighbouring villagers graze their stock in the parks and the spillover risk is omnipresent. Making it all the more important that the livestock in these marginal areas be routinely vaccinated each year. But being Africa this is the exception, not the rule.
