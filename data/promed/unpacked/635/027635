At least 70 people have died in northern Democratic Republic of Congo from an outbreak of hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, the World Health Organization said on Thursday [21 Aug 2014], denying that the illness was Ebola.

A WHO report dated Thu 21 Aug 2014 and seen by Reuters said that 592 people had contracted the disease, of whom 70 died. Among the dead are 5 health care workers, including one doctor.

"This is not Ebola," a WHO spokesman said in an email to Reuters on Thursday [21 Aug 2014].

A local priest who asked not to be named said that the illness had affected several villages and estimated that the death toll was over 100 people.

Kinshasa sent its health minister, Felix Kabange Numbi, and a team of experts on Wednesday [20 Aug 2014] to the region after reports of several deaths.

The outbreak began in the remote jungle province of Equateur where the 1st case of Ebola was reported in 1976, prompting speculation that it was the same illness that has killed more than 1350 people in an outbreak now raging in West Africa.

Symptoms of the 2 diseases are similar; they include vomiting, diarrhoea and internal bleeding. But the fatality rate for this outbreak of haemorrhagic gastroenteritis is much lower than the West Africa Ebola outbreak, at around 12 percent versus close to 60 percent.

The WHO, which sent representatives to the area on Wednesday [20 Aug 2014] together with the Congolese team of experts, said 4 samples would be flown from the town of Boende on Friday [22 Aug 2014] to the capital Kinshasa for further testing.

Medical charity MSF said it had also sent a team to Equateur province to assess the situation. MSF said it was too early to confirm what the disease was.

[Although the clinical picture described for these cases is compatible with Ebola virus disease, there is now some doubt due to the relatively low case fatality rate compared to previous Ebola virus infections in this area.

As the above and previous reports indicate, Ebola virus is endemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo [DRC], and there have been sporadic outbreaks there over the past nearly 40 years. There was an unconfirmed but suspected outbreak of Ebola-like disease in neighboring Orientale province last month (July 2014; see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140721.2624831). Because this current DRC outbreak is quite distant from the West African outbreak, the WHO has discarded the possibility that these 2 outbreaks are related, especially since the DRC Equateur outbreak is reported to be in an isolated location. It is urgent to confirm (or discard) Ebola virus as the etiological cause of the disease occurring there, and one hopes that the group of experts can facilitate a rapid diagnosis. ProMED would appreciate receiving further information about additional cases and results of laboratory tests.

There is a map in the previous report showing the location of Equateur province. A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map showing the location of the DRC can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=2713435,194. - Mod.TY]
