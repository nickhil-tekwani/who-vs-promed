ANTHRAX - USA: FINGERPRINT QUESTIONS

Could you explain how the different worldwide anthrax strains are
differentiated? Is there a certain part of the _Bacillus anthracis_
genome that is "fingerprinted" in order to do this?
What is the technique used to accomplish this feat, e.g., RAPD-PCR, or
ribotyping?
How would a terrorist have acquired the "Ames strain" used in the
attacks?
What is the difference between the "Ames strain or strains" and the
vaccine strain called "Sterne"?
The strain used in the human vaccine made by Bioport is apparently
only different from field strains in that it lacks a capsule....and
the vaccine is made from the Protective Antigen (PA) obtained from
this strain? Is the same seed stock used to make the human subunit
vaccine also used to make the "live" spore suspension used in cattle
vaccines?
Is the seed stock for any of these vaccines believed to be the culprit
in the bioterrorist attacks? If that is correct I guess that tells me
that the seed stock is not avirulent for humans? ...or at least if
you put its spores up someone's nose that route makes it more
virulent?
If you could help me to understand the answers to these questions, I
would really appreciate the help! I am getting a lot of questions
from veterinarians about these issues.

[The methodology ... MLVA "Multi-locus variable number tandem repeat"
is given in Keim et al, J Bact 2000 vol 182(10): 2928-2936. It works
by measuring the number of repeats at various places in the gene
sequence. These repeat areas have been mapped and we know the range of
possible repeats for each. Essentially, it is a bar-code.
While Sterne and Ames are in the same genetype group ("Sterne-Ames")
there are significant differences. We have located wild Sterne in
Africa with all its plasmids. The Ames could have come from virtually
anywhere, as the classic cultivar was circulated widely. However we
have only found wild versions of Ames in the USA. - Mods.MHJ/TG]
[Many veterinarians accidentally inoculate themselves with vaccine
strains -- livestock doesn´t stand still for the needle. Results vary
from nothing at all to easily treated skin lesions. - Mod.JW]
