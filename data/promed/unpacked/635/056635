XYLELLA, OLIVE - FRANCE: (PROVENCE-ALPES-COTE D'AZUR)

France's agriculture ministry said that 2 decorative olive trees in southern France (Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region) were found to be infected with _Xylella fastidiosa_. Although the disease has been found on other plants in southern France and on Corsica starting in 2015, it was the 1st time olive trees had been impacted.

The ministry said the 2 trees would be destroyed, and all other plants particularly vulnerable to the bacterium within a 5 km [3.2 mi] radius will be pulled up to try to prevent spread. The [trees] were struck by the same "pauca" subspecies that has devastated millions of euros' worth of ancient olive trees across Italy.

The European Commission describes xylella as "one of the most dangerous plant bacteria worldwide, causing a variety of diseases, with huge economic impact for agriculture, public gardens, and the environment." Scientists say there is a real risk the disease will spread to the entire Mediterranean basin, where olive oil is a staple in the diet and vital to the economy.

[_Xylella fastidiosa_ (Xf) clogs the xylem of plants, leading to wilting, necrosis, and often death. It causes many serious crop diseases such as Pierce's disease of grapevine; leaf scorch of coffee, almond, and olive; peach phony disease; plum leaf scald; citrus variegated chlorosis; lucerne dwarf; and leaf scorch of a range of other woody species. Latent infections of wild species as potential pathogen reservoirs have also been reported. Several subspecies of Xf have been proposed, and more research is needed to determine their host range and risks to crops. Initially, all strains of _Xylella_ had been classified into a single species, but a 2nd species in the genus, _X. taiwanensis_, has recently been reported as the cause of a pear leaf scorch (see ProMED-mail post 20181022.6105629).

Xf is spread by xylem-feeding insects, but also by grafting and with infected plant material. It is not seed borne. Moist conditions favour the vectors and, therefore, Xf-associated diseases. Disease management is difficult due to the large numbers of hosts and vectors and may include use of clean planting and grafting material, as well as vector control. Both the bacterium and its main vectors are of serious international quarantine concern and are currently considered the most serious threat to European grape and fruit production. Xf has been included on the A2 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

Xf had previously been reported mainly from the Americas. In Europe, it was reported in 2013 in olives from Italy (ProMED-mail posts 20131101.2033095, 20140820.2708739, and 20140424.2425497), which was thought to be its 1st report in the region. However, during a recent court case by the European Commission against Italy for failing to control the disease early on, evidence has been presented to show that national authorities were aware of the presence of Xf as early as 2004 (see link below). In Spain, reports from 2009 onwards of a "wood decay fungus" killing almond trees (ProMED-mail posts 20091022.3630 and 20110907.2728) are now likely also to have been misdiagnosed outbreaks of Xf. Subsequent detection of multiple subspecies in a diversity of hosts, including some asymptomatic ornamentals, has suggested that some Xf strains have been present in the Mediterranean for a considerable amount of time. Unfortunately, a lack of diligence has resulted in failure to implement management options early on and is now leading to disastrous losses of valuable, slow-growing orchard trees.
