Outbreaks of chickenpox and hepatitis have been reported from
internment camps located in Vavuniyaa, where hundred of thousands of
internally displaced people (IDPs) from Vanni [(electoral) district
in the northeast of Sri Lanka] have been sheltered. More than 12 000
persons are reported to be suffering from chickenpox. 40 to 50 fresh
cases of chickenpox are reported daily.

By 12 Jun 2009, about 2139 cases of hepatitis [A or E?] have been
detected among IDPs, medical sources in Vavuniyaa said. By 16 Jun
2009, about 285 018 [2,85,018 in the original text] members of IDP
families are reported to be sheltered in several internment camps in
Vavuniyaa. 48 704 of them were discharged from hospitals and
make-shift government dispensaries after treatment for various
diseases.

3054 elderly refugees were released from these camps and handed over
to their relatives, medical sources said.

[Conditions in the internment camps for internally displaced persons
created in Sri Lanka following the cessation of conflict between the
LTTE (Liberation Tamil Tigers of Eelam) and the Sri Lankan government
are likely to facilitate spread of infectious disease. Childhood
diseases such as chickenpox are to be expected, since vaccination
will not have been practised widely prior to the conflict. The spread
of chickenpox is unlikely to be contained until the inmates of the
camps are dispersed (or vaccination is provided). Outbreaks of
enterically transmitted diseases such as hepatitis A and hepatitis E
are also likely. Hepatitis E is the more serious as it cannot be
controlled by vaccination. Hepatitis E virus infection is responsible
for the outbreak of hepatitis occurring currently among internally
displaced people in Uganda. Provision of clean water and sanitation
will be required to contain this outbreak.
