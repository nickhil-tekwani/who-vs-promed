'Brainworm' suspected in moose deaths
--------------------------------------
State wildlife officials are scrambling for answers after a "brainworm"
never before found in Alaska apparently killed at least 2 moose -- and
maybe more -- near Delta Junction.
Biologists and veterinarians are investigating the deaths of 5 other moose
in the area, one of which appears to have exhibited the same odd behavior
as the 2 moose killed by the parasite. Those moose were seen stumbling
around just hours before they died.
"We have not documented this type of worm causing disease or death in
Alaskan moose in the past, but that may be because we haven't looked
closely enough," wildlife veterinarian Kimberlee Beckmen with the Alaska
Department of Fish and Game said in a press release issued late Thursday.
"We need to study more samples to determine whether it's a new occurrence,
or it's been here all along," said Beckmen, who was on Barter Island Friday
and could not be reached for this story.
Wildlife officials are trying to figure out whether the parasite poses a
danger to moose around the state. The biggest fear is that the parasite is
meningeal worm, a parasite commonly found in white-tailed deer in the Lower
48 that has been known to infect moose and elk. While the worm is not fatal
in deer, it can kill moose, caribou, reindeer, and other ruminants.
"If it were meningeal worm, that would be a disaster for Alaska moose
populations," said Randy Zarnke, a retired state wildlife biologist who
spent 23 years at Fish and Game in Fairbanks as a disease specialist. "When
it gets in moose, it just tears them up."
At the same time, Zarnke said it "would really be jumping to conclusions
saying it is meningeal worm" without further tests to confirm it.
Officials know the parasite is a roundworm and that it is transmitted to
moose through larvae shed in moose feces that are picked up by snails and
slugs, which are eaten by other moose as they browse. Once inside the
animal, the parasite migrates into the brain and attacks the central
nervous system.
"It's way too premature to panic about what it is and what it might be,"
said fish and game public information officer Cathie Harms. "We know what
family it's in and what [genus] it's in, but we don't have a species yet."
The worm is not the same parasite that causes chronic wasting disease in
deer and elk in the Lower 48 and poses no health risk for people, livestock
or dogs, said Harms.
What has wildlife officials nervous is that at least 2 of the moose that
died demonstrated symptoms similar to those caused by meningeal worm,
including stumbling and lethargy. Biologists received the first report of
a moose stumbling around a little more than a month ago.
"Somebody called us and said they had a moose out in a hay field that was
kind of stumbling around and being fairly lethargic," said Steve DuBois
with ADF&G in Delta. "I told them to watch it a day or 2 and let us know
how it turned out, and it died." Biologists retrieved the moose and a week
later got another report of a moose in the same area displaying similar
behavior. That moose laid down in a driveway and died, DuBois said. Both
moose appeared to be in good physical condition, he said.
The parasite was found in the brain of the 2nd moose and chances are the
1st moose to die was infected too, based on its behavior, said DuBois.
Biologists have since located 5 more dead moose in Delta. One of those
appears to have gone through the same kind of pre-death ritual of stumbling
around, judging from tracks near the body, he said.
Tissue samples from those 5 moose are being analyzed and results should be
available within the next month.
"At this point we don't even know whether all the moose we have found have
died from this," said DuBois.
3 of the dead moose were found in the Tanana Loop area where there are
several dairy and game farms. But Harms declined to speculate whether the
parasite could have been transmitted to the moose by livestock or through
one of several elk farms in the area. "Those are all things we have to
look at," she said.
While winter-kill moose carcasses are a common sight around Alaska each
spring, most of the time their deaths are attributed to starvation. Judging
from what biologists have seen in Delta this spring, though, that may not
be the case.
"Every year at this time of year we get dead moose carcasses in lots of
places," said Harms. "It's easy to say it's winter die-off, but a lot of
them might not have died from starvation."
Biologists are asking people to report any sick or dead moose they see so
tissue samples can be taken to see if the deaths are related. "We'd like
to take a closer look at these animals while the tissue is fresh enough so
we can still perform a necropsy and look for signs of the parasite," said
DuBois.
Sightings of moose carcasses or strangely behaving moose can be reported to
the Alaska Department of Fish and Game office in Delta Junction at (907)
895-4484 or the Fairbanks office at (907) 459-7206.

[In the 1960s, a parasitic nematode, _Parelaphostrongylus tenuis_
("meningeal worm", also "deer worm"), was reported as constituting a
probable explanation for a wasting, debilitating disease with uncertain
aetiology affecting moose (_Alces alces americana_) in Eastern North
America. Several clinical and pathological signs remained unexplained. It
seems that the investigators of the current Alaskan cases suspect the same
parasite.
Recently, a similar syndrome in Nova Scotia moose has been found by A.
Frank et al to be related to cobalt and vitamin B12 deficiency (Ref: Nova
Scotia moose mystery - a moose sickness related to cobalt and vitamin B12
deficiency. The Science of the Total Environment 318 (2004), 89 - 100.
A final diagnosis of the moose die-off in Alaska is pending. - Mod.AS]
