Summary
-------
This report updates the 2012 recommendations by CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) regarding the use of influenza vaccines for the prevention and control of seasonal influenza (CDC. Prevention and control of influenza with vaccines: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP]. MMWR 2012;61:613-8). Routine annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged 6 months or over. For the 2013-14 influenza season, it is expected that trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV3) will be replaced by a quadrivalent LAIV formulation (LAIV4). Inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs) will be available in both trivalent (IIV3) and quadrivalent (IIV4) formulations. Vaccine virus strains included in the 2013-14 US trivalent influenza vaccines will be an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like virus, an H3N2 virus antigenically like the cell-propagated prototype virus A/Victoria/361/2011, and a B/Massachusetts/2/2012-like virus. Quadrivalent vaccines will include an additional influenza B virus strain, a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus, intended to ensure that both influenza B virus antigenic lineages (Victoria and Yamagata) are included in the vaccine. This report describes recently approved vaccines, including LAIV4, IIV4, trivalent cell culture-based inactivated influenza vaccine (ccIIV3), and trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV3). No preferential recommendation is made for one influenza vaccine product over another for persons for whom more than one product is otherwise appropriate. This information is intended for vaccination providers, immunization program personnel, and public health personnel. These recommendations and other information are available at CDC's influenza website (http://www.cdc.gov/flu); any updates also will be found at this website. Vaccination and health-care providers should check the CDC influenza website periodically for additional information.

Primary Changes and Updates in the Recommendations
--------------------------------------------------
Routine annual influenza vaccination of all persons aged 6 months and up continues to be recommended. No preferential recommendation is made for one influenza vaccine product over another for persons for whom more than one product is otherwise appropriate. Updated information and guidance in this document include the following:

- 2013-14 US trivalent influenza vaccines will contain an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like virus, an H3N2 virus antigenically like the cell-propagated prototype virus A/Victoria/361/2011, and a B/Massachusetts/2/2012-like virus. Quadrivalent vaccines will include an additional vaccine virus strain, a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus.
- Several new, recently licensed vaccines will be available for the 2013-14 season and are acceptable alternatives to other licensed vaccines indicated for their respective age groups. These vaccines include the following:
-- A quadrivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4; Flumist Quadrivalent [MedImmune, Gaithersburg, Maryland]) is expected to replace the trivalent (LAIV3) formulation. FluMist Quadrivalent is indicated for healthy, nonpregnant persons aged 2 through 49 years.
-- A quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4; Fluarix Quadrivalent [GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina]) will be available, in addition to the previous trivalent formulation. Fluarix Quadrivalent is indicated for persons aged 3 years and up.
-- A quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4; Fluzone Quadrivalent [Sanofi Pasteur, Swiftwater, Pennsylvania]) will be available, in addition to the previous trivalent formulation. Fluzone Quadrivalent is indicated for persons aged 6 months and up.
-- A quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4; FluLaval Quadrivalent [ID Biomedical Corporation/GlaxoSmithKline]) will be available, in addition to the previous trivalent formulation. FluLaval Quadrivalent is indicated for persons aged 3 years and up.
-- A trivalent cell culture-based inactivated influenza vaccine (ccIIV3; Flucelvax [Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, Cambridge, Massachusetts]) is indicated for persons aged 18 years and up.
-- A recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) vaccine (RIV3; FluBlok [Protein Sciences, Meriden, Connecticut]) is indicated for persons aged 18 through 49 years.
-- RIV3, an egg-free vaccine, is now an option for vaccination of persons aged 18 through 49 years with egg allergy of any severity.
-- For persons with egg allergy who have no known history of egg exposure but for whom results suggestive of egg allergy have been obtained on previous allergy testing, consultation with a physician with expertise in the management of allergic conditions is recommended before vaccination.

Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness
-------------------------------
Evaluating Influenza Vaccine Efficacy and Effectiveness Studies
---------------------------------------------------------------
Estimates of efficacy (i.e., prevention of illness among vaccinated persons enrolled in controlled clinical trials) and vaccine effectiveness (i.e., prevention of illness in vaccinated populations) of influenza vaccines depend on many factors, including the age and immunocompetence of the vaccine recipient, the degree of similarity between the viruses in the vaccine and those in circulation, study design, and the outcome being measured. Studies of influenza vaccine efficacy and effectiveness have used a variety of outcome measures, including the prevention of medically attended acute respiratory illness (MAARI), prevention of laboratory-confirmed influenza illness, prevention of influenza or pneumonia-associated hospitalizations or deaths, or prevention of seroconversion to circulating influenza virus strains. Efficacy or effectiveness for more specific outcomes such as laboratory-confirmed influenza typically will be higher than for less specific outcomes such as MAARI because the causes of MAARI include infections with other pathogens that influenza vaccination would not be expected to prevent. Observational studies that compare less-specific outcomes among vaccinated populations to those among unvaccinated populations might be more subject to biases than studies using laboratory outcomes. For example, an observational study that finds that influenza vaccination reduces overall mortality among elderly persons might be biased if healthier persons in the study are more likely to be vaccinated, and thus less likely to die for any reason (84,85). For studies assessing laboratory-confirmed outcomes, estimates of vaccine efficacy may also be affected be the sensitivity of the diagnostic tests used. A 2012 simulation study found that for each percentage point decrease in diagnostic test specificity for influenza virus infection, vaccine effectiveness would be underestimated by approximately 4 percent (86). Randomized controlled trials that measure laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections as the outcome are the most persuasive evidence of vaccine efficacy, but such data are not available for all populations. Such trials might be difficult to conduct among groups recommended to receive vaccine annually.

Immune Response Following Vaccination
-------------------------------------
Humoral and cell-mediated responses to influenza vaccination have been studied among children and adults. Serum antibodies are considered to be correlates of vaccine-induced protection. Increased levels of antibody induced by vaccination decrease the risk for illness caused by strains that are antigenically similar to those strains of the same type or subtype included in the vaccine. Most healthy children and adults have high titers of strain-specific antibody after vaccination. However, although immune correlates such as achievement of certain antibody titers after vaccination correlate well with immunity on a population level, reaching certain antibody threshold (typically defined as a hemagglutination inhibition antibody or HAI titer of 32 or 40) might not predict protection from infection on the individual level.

While LAIV [live attenuated influenza vaccine] induces lower levels of serum antibodies compared with IIV [inactivated influenza vaccine], LAIV more effectively induces cellular immune responses than IIV. The magnitude of this effect differs among adults and children. One study of children aged 6 months through 9 years and adults aged 22 through 49 years noted a significant increase in influenza A-specific interferon gamma-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells among children following LAIV but not following IIV. No significant increase in these parameters was noted among adults following either vaccine.

Antibody elicited by vaccination is generally strain-specific, such that antibody against one influenza virus type or subtype confers limited or no protection against another type or subtype, nor does it confer protection against antigenic variants of the same virus that arise by antigenic drift. Cellular immune responses might arise from more conserved viral epitopes and thus potentially provide broader heterosubtypic immunity. Administration of 2007-08 seasonal vaccine to adults boosted T-cell responses to both seasonal and pandemic 2009(H1N1) HA (93); this effect was significantly greater for LAIV. Among children aged 6 through 35 months, LAIV (but not IIV) induced T-cell responses to highly conserved viral peptides (94).

Duration of Immunity
--------------------
The composition of influenza vaccines is changed in most seasons, with one or more vaccine strains replaced annually to provide protection against viruses that are anticipated to circulate. Evidence from some clinical trials indicates that that protection against viruses that are antigenically similar to those contained in the vaccine extends at least for 6-8 months, particularly in nonelderly populations. In some situations, duration of immunity might be longer, and such effects can be detected if circulating influenza virus strains remain antigenically similar for multiple seasons. For example, 3 years after vaccination with the A/Hong Kong/68 vaccine (i.e., the 1968 pandemic vaccine), effectiveness was 67 percent for prevention of influenza caused by the A/Hong Kong/68 virus. In randomized trials conducted among healthy college students, immunization with IIV provided 92 percent and 100 percent efficacy against influenza H3N2 and H1N1 illnesses, respectively, during the 1st year after vaccination, and a 68 percent reduction against H1N1 illness during the 2nd year after vaccination (when the predominant circulating virus was H1N1) without revaccination. In a similar study of young adults conducted in 1986-1987, IIV reduced influenza A(H1N1) illness by 75 percent in the 1st year after vaccination, reduced H3N2 illness by 45 percent in the 2nd year, and reduced H1N1 illness by 61 percent during the 3rd year after vaccination. Serum HAI influenza antibodies and nasal IgA elicited by vaccination remain detectable in children vaccinated with LAIV for more than 1 year after vaccination. In one community-based nonrandomized open-label trial, continued protection from MAARI during the 2000-01 influenza season was demonstrated in children who received only a single dose of LAIV during the previous 1999-00 season. A review of 4 trials (3 randomized blinded and one open-label) of LAIV conducted among young children aged 6 months through 18 years reported that efficacy against A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) was similar at 9-12 months postvaccination to efficacy at 1 to less than 5 months postvaccination; for B strains efficacy was still comparable at 5-7 months postvaccination. Two randomized trials and one open label study reported residual efficacy through a 2nd season without revaccination, albeit at lower levels than observed in the 1st season.

Adults aged 65 years and up typically have diminished immune responses to influenza vaccination compared with healthy younger adults. One review of the published literature concluded that no clear evidence existed that vaccine-induced antibody declined more rapidly in the elderly. A case-control study conducted in Navarre, Spain during the 2011-12 season revealed a decline in vaccine effectiveness from 61 percent (95 percent CI = 5-84) in the 1st 100 days postvaccination, to 42 percent (95 percent CI = -39-75) for days 110-119 days postvaccination, to -35 percent (95 percent CI = -211-41) thereafter. This decline primarily affected persons aged 65 years and up, among whom effectiveness declined from 85 percent (95 percent CI = -8-98) to 24 percent (95 percent CI = -224-82) to -208 (95 percent CI = -1563-43) over the same time intervals. However, most viruses isolated among infected vaccinees did not match the vaccine strains. In addition, the wide CIs surrounding the point estimates indicate that larger studies are needed to further characterize the magnitude of possible declines in vaccine effectiveness through the season. Limited available data suggest that administration of additional vaccine doses during the same season does not increase the antibody response among elderly vaccines.

People like myself who spend the northern flu season flu season (Nov-Mar) in the southern hemisphere, but visit the northern hemisphere for congresses during its flu season (Nov - Mar) -- and vice versa -- must study the recommendations for both hemispheres to determine whether the vaccine composition of the one will protect in the other, or if we need to get a 2nd shot appropriate for the other hemisphere. - Mod.JW]
