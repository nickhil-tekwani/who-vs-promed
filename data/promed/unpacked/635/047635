[According to the Saudi MOH statements, there have now been 414 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 115 deaths identified in Saudi Arabia since September 2012. Of the 3 newly confirmed cases in the above report, all 3 have a history of co-morbidities, 1 of the 3 had been admitted to a hospital 2.5 weeks prior to the onset of respiratory symptoms, suggesting that the source of transmission was within the hospital. By probable dates of onset of disease, 2 of the 3 newly confirmed cases occurred approximately 1-1.5 weeks before this report. Reviewing the case descriptions on the 43 newly confirmed MERS-CoV infections reported by Saudi Arabia over the preceding 3 days and today (2,3,4 and 5 May 2014), the most recent date of onset of disease in cases reported in Riyadh, was on 1 May 2014 - a 27 year old male who presented with fever and diarrhea, and was a known contact of a confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection. The most recent date of onset of disease in cases reported in Jeddah is 30 Apr 2014 in a 70 year old male. In today's report [5 May 2014], in Madinah the most recent date of onset of disease is 3 May 2014.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- update 5 May 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------
On [24 Apr 2014], the National IHR [International Health Regulations] Focal Point (NFP) of Jordan reported a laboratory-confirmed case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in a 28-year-old male from Saudi Arabia.

He was identified through contact tracing activities and is asymptomatic. He is a relative of a previously reported case on [23 Apr 2014]. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected on [22 Apr 2014] and by [24 Apr 2014] the Central Public Health Laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV by PCR testing. The national authorities of Saudi Arabia have traced contacts for this case and the case reported on [22 Apr 2014]. No secondary cases were identified.

[This additional laboratory confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection was identified in an asymptomatic contact of a known MERS-CoV case (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (47): Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, WHO 20140502.2442560 and MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (40): Saudi Arabia, UAE, Jordan ex KSA, WHO, RFI 20140424.2424017 for details on the case this individual had contact with.) It is unclear if the newly confirmed MERS-CoV infected individual mentioned above was in Jordan or was in Saudi Arabia, albeit one suspects it is the former as it is being formally reported by Jordan. Clarification would be greatly appreciated.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- update 5 May 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------
On 2 May 2014, the US IHR National Focal Point reported the 1st laboratory confirmed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in a male US citizen in his 60s, who lives and works in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

He traveled to the US from Riyadh to Chicago on [24 Apr 2014], via London Heathrow, with travel from Chicago to Indiana by bus.

He reportedly worked in Riyadh. US health officials do not know at this time whether he directly cared for MERS-CoV confirmed cases and what infection control precautions were used. The CDC Team is working with the Indiana State Health Department to collect more data on the patient, including this information.

He began feeling unwell on or around [14 Apr 2014] with a low-grade fever without any respiratory symptoms. On [27 Apr 2014], he developed shortness of breath, cough, increasing fever, and mild runny nose. On [28 Apr 2014], he was seen in an emergency room. A chest x-ray showed infiltrates in the right lung base and he was admitted to hospital and placed in a private room. Negative pressure room and airborne precautions were reportedly implemented on [29 Apr 2014]; full isolation (standard, contact, and airborne) precautions were implemented on [30 Apr 2014]. A chest computed tomography on [29 Apr 2014] showed bilateral lung infiltrates. Currently the patient is stable with shortness of breath; he is not intubated.

CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine (DGMQ) has been and continues to work with local, state, and international partners, as well as airlines and the bus company to obtain the passenger manifests from the 2 flights and information from the bus company to help identify, locate, and interview contacts.

This is the 1st report of an imported case of MERS-CoV in the United States and in the Americas Region.

[Recent media reports on this case have suggested the patient has improved clinically and would be discharged from the hospital shortly (see CNN report at http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/05/health/mers-outbreak-update/). The same media report mentioned that other healthcare workers who had contact with this case have been tested for MERS-CoV infection but to date, no additional infections have been documented.

In an earlier post, this moderator mentioned that from the information available at that time, it appeared as though the patient did not become symptomatic until arrival in the USA, and therefore most likely was not highly infectious for others around him during his travels. The clinical timeline above suggests that there was the onset of prodromal symptoms approximately 10 days prior to travel. Hence it is possible he was "infective" at that time. That being said, the operative word here is "possible". There are still many unanswered questions on the natural history of the infection with MERS-CoV and about its transmission. If the clinical timeline above is correct vis a vis when full isolation procedures were initiated, there is the possibility of secondary spread of the virus in the hospital environment. Hopefully the partial isolation and respiratory precautions that were implemented were adequate to prevent nosocomial spread. - Mod.MPP]

[4] Overview: Science News
Date: Mon 5 May 2014

https://www.sciencenews.org/article/middle-eastern-outbreak-picks-pace


After new case numbers held steady for 2 years, the MERS outbreak increased rapidly in April [2014].

Behind the news that the United States has had its 1st case of the deadly respiratory virus known as Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or MERS coronavirus [MERS-CoV], is a far more worrisome trend: case numbers are exploding on the Arabian Peninsula. As doctors struggle to treat patients, scientists are rushing to answer some basic questions about the virus's biology, whose answers could stop the virus from becoming a pandemic.

As far as anyone knows, the 1st human victims of MERS were a university student and a nurse, who both got sick and died in Jordan in the spring of 2012. In the 2 years between then and March 2014, public health officials recorded an average of 14 or 15 cases per month, for a total of 207 cases. Of those cases, 93 people died, making the mortality rate about 45 percent.

"If you do the math on the mortality rate of the virus and the number of people on the planet, it's scary," says Ralph Baric, a virologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [USA] who has long studied coronaviruses, including MERS and its cousin SARS.

The situation has only worsened recently. In April 2014 alone the MERS virus infected at least 217 people -- more than in the previous 2 years combined -- and killed 38, mostly in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Those countries have been focal points of the disease since early in the outbreak. And the 1st documented case in the United States was announced on [2 May 2014]; the patient is a healthcare worker who had recently traveled from Saudi Arabia (SN Online: 2 May 2014).

The World Health Organization has a team in Saudi Arabia attempting to determine why MERS has begun to spread so rapidly, says WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic. WHO has already ruled out one possibility: "There is absolutely no evidence that the virus has changed," he said.

Part of the problem in explaining the deluge of cases is that no one is certain how people become infected, Jasarevic says. Both camels and bats have been found to carry related viruses, with camels regarded as the most likely source for human infections.

Now, researchers have discovered that dromedary camels carry live MERS viruses in their noses that can infect primate cells. Thomas Briese, a virologist and molecular geneticist at the Colombia University [New York, USA] and his colleagues report the finding [29 Apr 2014] in mBio. The evidence strengthens the case that camels may be a reservoir of infection. Previous studies had hinted that the dromedaries could be involved (SN: 5 Apr 2014, p 8), but fell short of demonstrating that the animals carry live viruses that can be transmitted to humans.

Even with the incriminating evidence, camels can't be blamed for all MERS cases. Many people who have fallen ill were city dwellers who had no contact with camels, Briese says. And if camels were the primary source, he says, one might expect camel handlers or people who work at slaughterhouses or otherwise have intense contact with camels and their bodily fluids to be the people who get MERS most often. But that's not the case, Briese says.

Instead, the virus most often attacks the old and already sick. Scientists are still trying to determine what makes some people more susceptible. Also unclear is exactly how the virus makes the leap from camel to human. Briese and his colleagues are testing camel meat, milk, and urine as possible sources of the virus.

The method of transmission is just one of the fundamental questions scientists have yet to answer about MERS nearly a year and a half after its discovery.

Researchers have learned that MERS uses a protein on its surface, known as the spike protein, to pick a particular lock and gain access to human cells. The lock is a protein known as dipeptidyl peptidase 4, or DPP4, that sits on the surfaces of cells (SN Online: 13 Mar 2013). Many species make a version of DPP4, but the MERS virus can crack a limited number of those, including the versions made by humans, camels, and bats. It can't get past the DPP4 lock on the surfaces of cells from mice, rats, or ferrets, says Vincent Munster, a virologist at the National Institutes of Health's Rocky Mountain National Laboratory in Hamilton, Mont.

That's a problem because it means those laboratory favorites can't be experimentally infected with MERS. Munster and his colleagues discovered that the coronavirus can infect rhesus monkeys, however. The researchers can use the primates to test potential therapies. But the monkeys don't completely mimic the human infection, Munster says, and "not that many labs can handle nonhuman primates."

Finding a useful animal MERS model may be partially solved thanks to a team led by Stanley Perlman, a virologist and pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Iowa in Iowa City. Perlman and his colleagues devised a way to get mice to temporarily produce the human version of DPP4 in their respiratory tracts, the researchers reported in the [1 Apr 2014] Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Mice that make human DPP4 can be infected with MERS coronavirus, enabling the researchers to learn how the immune system handles the virus.

Perlman's group is genetically engineering mice to permanently replace their DPP4 protein with the human version. If all goes as planned, the mice should be available in November [2014], Perlman says.

Other potentially good news surfaced when 2 groups of researchers reported [28 Apr 2014] in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and in the [30 Apr 2014] Science Translational Medicine that they had isolated human antibodies that could prevent the MERS virus from latching on to its target. The discovery raises the possibility that the antibodies could be used to treat MERS infections or to protect healthcare workers or close contacts of MERS patients from becoming infected with the virus, says Wayne Marasco, an immunologist and infectious disease specialist at Harvard Medical School in Boston, a coauthor of one of the reports.

The study also suggests that healthy human immune systems can keep the MERS virus in check, Marasco says. During the course of the experiments, sometimes the virus developed mutations in its spike protein that allowed MERS to evade the antibodies' grasp. "In cases where viruses could escape, they did so at the expense of their own fitness," says Marasco. The mutated viruses either had a harder time grasping cells, which would make infection harder, or they grew less well in primate cells. Weakened viruses may be easy pickings for a strong immune system.

Unfortunately, many people who have contracted MERS already had other illnesses that may have damaged their ability to fight the virus. Each infected person is like a test tube where the virus can mutate; having more test tubes means an ever-increasing chance that the virus could become better at growing in humans. "A weakened immune system is clearly consistent with an environment where adaptation can occur," says Marasco.

Many of the new cases in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have been spread from a sick person to a healthcare worker, family member, hospital patient, or another contact. People who caught the virus from someone else tend to have mild illnesses or no symptoms at all, Jasarevic says, and the virus rarely, if ever, transmits beyond the 2nd person infected.

That's an assertion that Trish Perl, an epidemiologist and infectious disease doctor at Johns Hopkins University, challenges. Perl traveled to Saudi Arabia last year [2013] to investigate a large MERS outbreak at hospitals. The researchers found evidence for long chains of person-to-person transmission of the virus, especially among dialysis patients (SN Online: 19 Jun 2013). "It's clear that there is a lot going on in the healthcare environment," Perl says.

In the last month [April 2014], health officials have reported a growing number of milder cases and cases with no symptoms. Some of those cases may have been detected thanks to better surveillance and it is possible that mild cases were missed earlier. The growing number of milder cases is also lowering the virus's overall mortality rate to somewhere around 30 percent. That's still a frightening number, Perlman says, but "it's not as scary as it could be."

He sees MERS as primarily a camel cold virus that sometimes leaps into susceptible people; proper precautions, he says, may make it disappear. "If you have good infection control measures and people stop getting so close to sick camels, there's a good chance it will die out."

[The summary above gives a very nice overview of the state of studies primarily addressing the clinical expression and treatment implications for MERS-CoV infections. The focus of the discussion surrounds the observed significant increase in numbers of confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported during the month of April 2014 and the possible implications. The one study published to date that evaluated major nosocomial transmission in Saudi Arabia mentioned in the article above, did demonstrate "long chains of person-to-person transmission." (See Assiri A, McGeer A, Perl TM, Price CS, Al Rabeeah AA, Cummings DA, Alabdullatif ZN, Assad M, Almulhim A, Makhdoom H, Madani H, Alhakeem R, Al-Tawfiq JA, Cotten M, Watson SJ, Kellam P, Zumla AI, Memish ZA; KSA MERS-CoV Investigation Team: Hospital outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.

Comparable information on the apparent nosocomial outbreaks in Jeddah, Riyadh, and possibly the UAE are not as yet available to permit interpretations, but given the more than 1 month ongoing transmission, it is quite likely that there are lengthy transmission chains ongoing there as well. We await further information. - Mod.MPP]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Scientists are scrambling to make sense of a sharp increase in reported infections with the deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus. In April [2014] alone, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have reported over 200 new cases -- more than all MERS-affected countries combined in the preceding 2 years. That has sparked fresh fears that the virus may be about to go on a global rampage.

The World Health Organization expressed alarm at the new numbers, and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) published an updated risk assessment on [25 Apr 2014] warning European countries to expect more imported cases. Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, replaced its health minister.

The surge has raised concerns that the virus is undergoing genetic changes that might cause it to become pandemic. But none have been identified so far, and several other factors could be to blame, scientists say -- from increased testing to sloppy hospital hygiene and a wave of camel births across the region.

Saudi Arabia alone has now reported 345 MERS cases, including 105 deaths [as of today, 5 May 2014, this figure is up to 414 cases and 115 deaths], since the start of the epidemic in 2012; most of the new cases are in Jeddah, in the western part of the country. Many worry that mutations in the virus's genome might be making it more adept at spreading between humans -- as happened with MERS's distant cousin, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), in 2002 and 2003.

To explore that possibility, virologist Christian Drosten of the University of Bonn in Germany is collaborating with Saudi Deputy Minister of Health Ziad Memish. On [18 Apr 2014], Drosten's lab received 31 samples taken from Jeddah patients; 29 had tested positive for MERS in 2 separate PCR tests in a local lab. Drosten's team confirmed the diagnosis for 28 of the samples, suggesting that false positive results -- which occur easily with PCR -- aren't the problem.

On [26 Apr 2014], the lab finished sequencing 3 viral genomes and quickly posted them on the Internet. "These sequences look completely normal," Drosten says. "There is no reason to assume they have acquired changes increasing their pandemic potential."

Memish believes the main cause for the surge is increased testing, triggered by growing media attention to MERS. Until recently, only patients with pneumonia who needed intensive care were tested for the virus, he says. "But because of the media hype, people have started coming into emergency rooms and hospitals complaining of mild fever or a cough, demanding to be tested." Doctors have complied, Memish says, leading to more diagnoses, especially of mild cases. Drosten, who was in Riyadh early this week, confirms that the city is on edge: "You see people walking around with facemasks now," he says.

But Denis Coulombier, head of surveillance and response at ECDC, notes that "the proportion of symptomatic to asymptomatic cases is in line with what we have seen previously, so changes in testing do not fully explain the increase we see in April [2014]." And Bart Haagmans of Erasmus MC in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, says that it is hard to tell from a sequenced genome whether the virus has undergone adaptive changes. Even in influenza, one of the most studied pathogens in the world, scientists hardly know what mutations to look for, he says.

Drosten believes an additional reason for the spike may be a lack of hygiene in the worst affected hospital in Jeddah, which would help the virus spread between patients and healthcare workers -- although it's unclear exactly what the hospital is doing wrong.

Camels may also play a minor role in the explosive rise. Scientists have shown that many dromedary camels in the Middle East and Africa harbor the virus, and in recent months, camels at breeding facilities have given birth en masse, as they do every winter. The offspring may act as natural virus incubators, increasing the risk that humans become infected.

Drosten's data reinforce the idea that MERS is repeatedly crossing the species barrier between camels and humans, says evolutionary biologist Andrew Rambaut of the University of Edinburgh in the United Kingdom. The 3 genomes Drosten posted this past weekend are most closely related to one isolated from a Qatari patient who was treated in England in September 2012, Rambaut says. There is no known connection between the cases in Qatar and Jeddah, and given that so many camels are infected, it is much more likely that a virus with this sequence crossed to humans twice -- once in Qatar and again at the start of the Jeddah cluster -- than that the virus passed through a chain of unknown human patients, he says.

Such jumps from camels to humans "will just continue happening until the exposure to camels is reduced," Rambaut says. The question is how to do that, because it's unclear how the virus crosses from camels to humans. One route could be unpasteurized camel milk, consumed widely in the Middle East; scientists at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases recently showed that the virus is stable for at least 72 hours in raw camel milk. Haagmans hopes to test camel urine and milk from the region for the virus soon. Contaminated meat could also play a role. Another, less likely possibility is that the virus is transmitted through the air. Virus excreted by camels could cling to dust particles, for instance, and infect humans who inhale it.

Some answers may come from Qatar. Researchers there have teamed up with Marion Koopmans and other scientists at Erasmus MC for the biggest study by far of how MERS spreads. The team plans to sample camels and other animals, as well as humans, at about 500 farms to look for the virus and antibodies against it; 80 people have been trained to question farm workers in detail about their behavior, and Koopmans says she has shipped more than 45 000 labels for samples to Qatar. "We really have to step up our efforts to understand what is going on," she says.

[This overview in Science is also in response to the major increase in laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infection, with a focus on the studies directed at identifying the animal source and transmission route. Studies to date are pointing more and more at the camels as the animal host for this virus, and suggestive that infected camels are the likely source of transmission of the virus to humans. It has become clear that infection in camels is occurring in juveniles (less than 2 years of age), and these may well be the source of viral shedding responsible for the initial human infections. Again, there are many questions to be addressed, and we await the answers. - Mod.MPP]

[As there have now been 7 countries (UK, France, Italy, Greece, Tunisia, Malaysia, and USA) confirming MERS-CoV infection in individuals returning from the Middle East, and more recently in those returning from making a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia, it appears as though there is now an increased awareness internationally to test severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) patients returning from Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries for the possibility of infection with MERS-CoV. Prior media reports on "suspected" cases had been associated with resultant negative laboratory tests for presence of MERS-CoV infection. Oftentimes the viral culprit has been the influenza A(H1N1) virus. We await results of laboratory testing on these 2 suspected cases. - Mod.MPP]
