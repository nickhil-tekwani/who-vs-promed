A new canker and twig dieback disease of apple and crabapple
trees caused by _Sphaeropsis pyriputrescens_ in Washington
State

Crabapple (_Malus sylvestris_) is commonly used as a source
of pollen in apple production. During September and October
2003, a canker and twig dieback disease of 'Manchurian'
crabapple trees was observed in some commercial apple
(_Malus x domestica_ Borkh.) orchards (7-10 years old) in
north-central Washington State. A fungus was consistently
isolated from 40-77 per cent of sampled crabapple trees.
During May 2004, the same symptoms and fungal association
were observed in an 8 year old 'Fuji' apple orchard in which
all crabapple pollenizers and 43 per cent of the Fuji trees
were diseased. Canker and dieback appeared to originate from
infection of dying or dead fruit spurs or pruning wounds.
Cankered areas were slightly sunken, brown and the margin of
diseased area often developed cracks in the cortical tissue.
Pycnidia were often present in older areas of the lesion.
Pycnidia were black, 0.3 to 0.6 mm in diameter, separate to
aggregated in small numbers, and partially immersed to
nearly superficial in the diseased tissue.
To isolate the fungus, outer bark tissues of diseased twigs
were scraped and small tissue segments were cut from the
canker margin. Tissue segments were surface disinfested for
5 min in 0.5 per cent sodium hypochlorite solution, rinsed 3
times with sterile water, cut into small pieces, and placed
on acidified potato-dextrose agar (APDA, 4.0 ml of a 25 per
cent solution of lactic acid per liter of medium). Isolation
plates were incubated at 20 deg C in the dark. Colonies of
the fungus first appeared as dense colorless mycelium that
later turned light yellow to yellow. The fungus was
identified as _Sphaeropsis pyriputrescens_ Xiao & JD Rogers
(1).
To complete Koch's postulates, 2 isolates (one each from
apple and crabapple) were used in pathogenicity tests on
'Fuji' apple and 'Manchurian' crabapple trees. In the
orchard, selected 2 year old twigs were sprayed with 70 per
cent ethanol and allowed to dry. Twigs were wounded to a
depth of 1 to 2 mm with a sterile 5 mm diameter cork borer;
a 5 mm mycelial plug from 4 day old PDA cultures of _S.
pyriputrescens_ was placed into each wound. Twigs wounded
and treated with sterile APDA plugs were used as controls.
Inoculation sites were covered with moist cheesecloth and
sealed with Parafilm that was removed 3 weeks after
inoculation.
4 twigs per isolate on each of 4 trees were inoculated. The
experiment was conducted twice (April and November 2004 for
apple; 2 different locations in March 2004 for crabapple).
At 2 and 6 months after inoculation, 2 apple twigs per
treatment were removed from each tree. All crabapple twigs
were removed 2 months after inoculation.
Canker sizes were measured and reisolation of the fungus was
attempted as described above. Both isolates caused cankers
on apple and crabapple twigs. Mean canker sizes at 6 months
after inoculation were 11 and 32 mm on apple twigs
inoculated in April and November 2004, respectively and 7 to
8 mm on crabapple twigs at 2 months after inoculation. No
cankers developed on control twigs.
_S. pyriputrescens_ was reisolated from all inoculated twigs
and was not recovered from noninoculated controls. _S.
pyriputrescens_ is the cause of Sphaeropsis rot, a recently
reported postharvest fruit rot disease of apple and pear
(1,2).
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of this fungus
causing cankers and twig dieback on apple and crabapple
trees.

[Sphaeropsis rot [SR] is a newly reported postharvest fruit
rot disease of d'Anjou pears and apple. First found on
d'Anjou pear, it was shown to be much more severe on apples.
In one instance, 2 percent of the apple fruit in storage
bins was rotted by SR after several months of storage. SR
has been recorded on d'Anjou pear and on several apple
varieties (Red Delicious, Golden Delicious, Fuji, and Granny
Smith). Surveys for diseases of stored pears in Washington
State in the late 1930s and in the past 60 years did not
yield detailed data. 75 distinct fungal species belonging to
22 genera are associated with fruit rots in stored pears but
no _Sphaeropsis_ spp. were reported in the latter study.
The SR fungus grows at -3 to 25 deg C, does not grow at 30
deg C but survives at this temperature. Optimum temperature
for mycelial growth is between 15 and 20 deg C. Conidia
germinate at 0 to 30 deg C, and a minimum wetness duration
of 5-6 h is required for germination at optimum temperature.
Conidia can germinate at relative humidity as low as 92 per
cent.
SR causes twig dieback and cankers on apple and crabapple
trees. 'Manchurian' crabapple trees are very susceptible to
twig dieback and cankers caused by this fungus. It also
appears to be associated with dead bark or twigs on trees.
Fruiting bodies (pycnidia) of the fungus are often present
in diseased tissues on infected trees. The fungus primarily
infects the stem and calyx of fruit and causes stem-end rot
and calyx-end rot, respectively.
SR inoculum is apparently present in the orchard. Disease
management is relatively simple. Cankers and diseased twigs
with dieback symptoms should be removed from orchards to
reduce inoculum. For orchards with a high percentage of
crabapple trees as pollinizers, pruning diseased twigs is
particularly important to disease control. Research on
chemical control of this disease is currently in progress.
