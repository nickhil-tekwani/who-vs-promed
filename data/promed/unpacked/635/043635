USDA ADDS THE NETHERLANDS TO BSE LIST
WASHINGTON, April 14, 1997--The U.S. Department of Agriculture has
restricted the importation of fresh, chilled, and frozen meat and other
animal products and byproducts from ruminants that have been in the
Netherlands because of bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
The Netherlands' Ministry of Agriculture has confirmed two cases of BSE in
native cows. In order to reduce the risk of introducing BSE into the United
States, USDA has added the Netherlands to the list of countries where BSE is
known to exist.

"We cannot afford to take any chances with BSE. This action is necessary to
minimize the risk of introducing the disease into the United States," said
Joan M. Arnoldi, deputy administrator for veterinary services with the
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, a part of USDA's marketing and
regulatory programs mission area.
Other countries affected with BSE include the United Kingdom, France, the
Republic of Ireland, Oman, Portugal, and Switzerland.
No case of BSE has ever been diagnosed in the United States. Therefore,
APHIS' efforts have been proactive and preventative. APHIS, in cooperation
with USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service, has taken aggressive
measures in BSE surveillance, prevention, education, and response.
APHIS prohibited in 1989 the importation of live ruminants from countries
where BSE is known to exist in native cattle. Other products derived from
ruminants, such as beef, fetal bovine serum, bone meal, meat-and-bone meal,
blood meal, offal, fats, and glands, are also restricted entry into the
United States except under special conditions or under permit for scientific
or research purposes.
Notice of this interim rule is scheduled for publication in the April 15
Federal Register and became effective April 10.
Consideration will be given to comments on the interim rule received on or
before June 16. An original and three copies should be sent to Docket No.
97-034-1, Regulatory Analysis and Development, PPD, APHIS, Suite 3C03, 4700
River Road Unit 118, Riverdale, Md. 20737-1238.
Comments may be reviewed at USDA, Room 1141, South Building, 14th Street and
Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C., between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.,
Monday through Friday, except holidays. Persons wishing to review comments
are requested to call ahead at (202) 690-2817 to facilitate entry into the
comment reading room.
