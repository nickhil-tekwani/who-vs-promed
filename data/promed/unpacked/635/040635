The Australian bluetongue zoning map has been updated.
-----------------------------------------------------
Please go to
<http://www.animalhealthaustralia.com.au/nahis/public.php?page=namp_public&aha_program=2> to view or download the current version of the
map.

There has been a small expansion of the zone of possible activity in
the Northern Territory and Queensland border area, as well as a slight
westward expansion on the north coast of NSW.

Due to the popularity of these email updates, the system has been
modified to cope with the larger volumes.

[The NAMP-produced map on the Australian bluetongue situation, as
updated on 27 Aug 2009, is available at
<http://www.animalhealthaustralia.com.au/nahis/public.php?page=namp_map&raw=1&aha_program=2&recid=43>. This map, and the accompanying information, is useful for all parties interested in the epidemiology of bluetongue in Australia, as well as those importing Australian livestock whenever making decisions or recommendations related to bluetongue
zoning.

Bluetongue virus was 1st identified in Australia in 1977 in a pool of
culicoides insects trapped near Darwin in 1975. Bluetongue virus is
present in northern and eastern Australia, but according to official
information, despite intensive surveillance, there have not yet been
any reported occurrences of any of these viruses causing clinical
disease in commercial cattle in Australia under natural conditions.

The Australian National Arbovirus Monitoring Program (NAMP) is an
integrated national program jointly funded by industry and governments
to monitor the distribution of economically important insect-borne
viruses of livestock and their vectors.

The NAMP regularly updates the Bluetongue Zone Map. This zone map is
based on OIE guidelines and defines areas in which no viral activity
has been detected for at least the past 2 years. As the map is updated
in response to new monitoring information, it is subject to change
without notice.

The website provides additional information pertaining to vector-borne
animal diseases in Australia, including a review: "The history of
bluetongue, Akabane and ephemeral fever viruses and their vectors in
Australia, 1975-1999." - Mod.AS]
