The Bi-State Wildlife Hotline is warning parents and dog owners about a serious outbreak of distemper in several St Louis County communities.

Group founder and president Angel Wintrode tells KMOX News that since October [2012] they've had to start capturing and putting down infected raccoons at an incredibly high rate.

"In a normal year it would be maybe 3 or 4 a month," Wintrode says, "where right now we're doing 3 and 4 a day. It's crazy the amount that we are bringing in."

The added emphasis on dog owners is because dogs that haven't received their parvo-distemper shot are susceptible to the fatal neurological disease.

"This is not the standard rabies vaccine," Wintrode explains. "This is the extra vaccine that your veterinarian asks you 'Hey, do you want to do this extra one? It's only 15 bucks more'."

Why the sudden rash of distemper cases now? Wintrode believes the weather is at least partially to blame.

"We haven't had a good, hard freeze in 2 years now," she says. "We need that in Missouri. We need that to kill off the ticks. We need that to kill off the fleas. And we need that to kill off diseases in general, like parvo[virus] and distemper."

Infected raccoons often come out during daylight hours, showing little of their natural inclination to avoid contact with humans or pets. They might be stumbling around or falling over almost as if they were drunk, Wintrode says.

Infected raccoons have already been seen in Chesterfield, Ballwin, Ellisville, Manchester, Rock Hill, Kirkwood, Webster Groves, High Ridge and Fenton [in St Louis County].

They're contagious to unvaccinated dogs and if approached have the potential to injure people or pets.

[Canine distemper virus is the pathogen most frequently causing outbreaks at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface. As distemper and rabies affect the central nervous system, they both cause behavior disorders.

In raccoons, distemper usually results in neurological signs such as stumbling and lack of 'shyness', they can seem 'dumb' and/or 'friendly'. Rabid raccoons also might lose their fear to humans and other animals and they may become slower and are brought into stupor, but they present profuse salivation, indiscriminate biting, and odd vocalization.

A sharp increase in the number of diseased raccoons might be related to raises in the density of this animal. The lack of freezing alleged by Ms Wintrode very likely has a positive influence on the raccoon population dynamics.

It is very important to make sure to keep the vaccination schemes of all dogs in the area up to date, including both rabies and distemper.
