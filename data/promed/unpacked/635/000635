According to hunters in the Alytus region [county], massive mortality of wild boars has been observed. The hunters believe that the reason for this phenomenon is swine fever, coming to Lithuania from Belarus. Moreover, hunters accuse government agencies of hiding the appearance of the disease in Lithuania. The State Food and Veterinary Service (GPVS) claims that swine fever is not present in Lithuania.

One hunter said boar deaths have been recorded since last summer [2013]. "Now," he says, "there are already dead boar in additional areas, for example in Salcininkai" [a city in Vilnius county, south east Lithuania, near the border with Belarus].

Another interviewee told GRYNAS.lt that dead boars were found in Dzukija [Alytus county, site of a national park] since November 2013. According to him, during this period about 40 dead wild boar were found. The man said that the outward signs resemble African swine fever. According to his observations, most boars were found in the woods of Varchos, Kalesnikay, and Gediminas.

However, the chairman of Alytus's community of hunters and fishermen, Evaldas Daynauskas, told GRYNAS.lt that the situation should not be dramatised. He did not deny the fact of unexplained mortality of boars in the Alytus region, but argued that studies have not confirmed suspicions of plague.

According to the representative of GPVS, inspector Marius Masiulis, laboratory studies have not confirmed swine plague. "We always respond to calls and collect samples, but laboratory studies do not suggest that this is plague; the cause of mortality has not been established." He expressed hope that the cause of boar death will be clarified soon.

[Alytus is a city situated in southern Lithuania; it is the capital of Alytus county (maps at http://www.fallingrain.com/world/LH/56/Alytus.html and http://healthmap.org/r/9NLt).

Belarus, to the south east of Lithuania, reported 2 outbreaks of African swine fever (ASF) during 2013, one of them close to the border with Lithuania (see OIE: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/Diseaseoutbreakmaps; select ASF, start at 2011, zoom in to the region).

Lithuania's other neighboring countries, Poland (south west) and Latvia (north) are regarded as free of ASF; see political map at http://www.mapsofworld.com/lithuania/lithuania-political-map.html.

Russia, further to the east, has suffered 2 widely spread ASF epizootics since 2007, and declared the disease resolved as of 16 Dec 2013 (report submitted 25 Dec 2013).

Lithuania has, according to the OIE data, maintained throughout the years its status as free of ASF. Details and official results of the current laboratory and epidemiological investigations into the boar mortalities, with special attention to classical and African swine fever, would be helpful, hopefully diagnosing the causative agent(s). - Mod.AS]
