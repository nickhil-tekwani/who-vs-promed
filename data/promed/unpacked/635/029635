[2] Cholera - Mozambique (Maputo)

So far this rainy season, 317 cases of cholera have been diagnosed in
Maputo city, but nobody in the Mozambican capital has yet died of the
disease. According to the Maputo City chief doctor, Maria Benigna,
cited in Friday's [9 Jan 2008] issue of the independent daily "O
Pais," the 1st case in the current outbreak was diagnosed on 12 Oct
2008. She said that the cholera situation is under control and that
there is no reason for alarm.

A cholera treatment centre (CTC) was reopened in the Mavalane General
Hospital on 17 Dec 2008. Benigna said that currently 55 people are
hospitalized there. Recently, the CTC has been receiving 15-20
patients a day, and the trend is for the number of new cases to decline.

Most of the cases have been reported from densely populated, poor
neighborhoods such as Chmaculo, Mavalane and Polana-Canico. Ministry
of Health data indicate that over the past 10 months, there were
about 3000 cholera cases in 8 of Mozambique's 11 provinces, resulting
in 50 deaths.

68 new cholera cases have been reported in Limpopo, the Department of
Health said on Friday [9 Jan 2009]. 11 new cases were recorded in
Musina and Madimbo, 46 in Dilokong and 11 in Botlokwa since 8 Jan
2009, department spokesperson Phuti Seloba said.

"Our hot spots at the moment are Botlokwa and Dilokong. At present,
there were 1634 cases of cholera in Limpopo that have been recorded
since the outbreak," said Seloba. He said the department expected to
treat more cholera patients as Zimbabweans were moving back into
South Africa in large numbers.

A 41-year-old Zululand woman has been diagnosed with cholera, the
KwaZulu-Natal health department said on Thursday [8 Jan 2009].
Spokesperson Chris Maxon said this case brought the number of
confirmed cases in the province to 3. Tests on several others with
suspected cholera were negative.

Two others who were diagnosed with the water-borne disease in
December 2008 included a Zimbabwean trucker who died and an Ethiopian
man who traveled through Zimbabwe to South Africa. He was treated at
the Nkonjeni Hospital in Zululand and survived.

The South African victim had told health workers she had never been
to Zimbabwe and had never traveled "anywhere far in her life."

[5] Cholera - South Africa (Western Cape)
Date: Tue 6 Jan 2009
From: Steve Oliver <Stephen.Oliver@uct.ac.za>


May I just correct some of the details and update you on the current
situation. _V. cholerae_ has been isolated from the stools of 2 more
patients following on that initial young woman. Both are contacts of
that initial case, and person-to-person transmission is the most
likely mechanism of spread.

The strain is _V. cholerae_ O1 biotype Ogawa and phenotype El Tor.
This is the same as the predominant strain being isolated in Zimbabwe
but does not mean that there is necessarily any connection between
the 2 outbreaks. As Dr de Azevedo said, there was no history of
travel in these cases and no contact with any refugees from Zimbabwe.
The strains will undergo molecular analysis to further elucidate this issue.

[There are 3 distinct O1 biotypes, named Ogawa, Inaba, and Hikojima,
each of which may display the "classical" or El Tor phenotype. The
biotypes are distinguished by their expression of surface antigens A,
B, and C. Ogawa contains antigens A and B; Inaba antigens A and C;
and Hikojima antigens A, B, and C. The latter serotype is relatively rare.

ProMED thanks Dr. Oliver for this firsthand information. - Mod.LL]

Health officials noted a cholera outbreak for the past 3 weeks in
Ticao Island, Masbate after having recorded 124 cases and 2
fatalities in the towns of Monreal and San Fernando, the Department
of Health in Bicol reported Friday [9 Jan 2009].

Nestor Santiago Jr., Bicol health director, said in a report that in
Monreal town, most of the cases were seen in the village of
Guinhadap, with a total of 96. There were 4 cases in the village of
Morocborocan and 9 in the village of Poblacion.

In San Fernando town, all 15 cases were seen in the village of Ipil.

Most of the victims were children and adolescents. Initial laboratory
tests through stool culture revealed 3 of the 124 cases as positive
for _V. cholerae_ Ogawa.

Santiago Jr. said their study of the trend of cholera occurrence in
the Bicol region showed a reemergence every 3 to 4 years. "In 2009,
being the 4th year since its last region-wide increase, we expect the
reemergence of the disease," Santiago Jr. said.
