Continuous rain leads to berry drop in coffee
---------------------------------------------
It is a double trouble for coffee growing regions -- continuous rain
in the last 10 days of August [2011] has caused black rot to set in
arabica which has caused berry drop, said the Karnataka Planters
Association (KPA). In addition, non-availability of potash-based
fertilisers has also contributed to berry drop.

Black rot (koleroga) usually occurs during high humidity and hanging
mist causing blackening and subsequent rotting of young leaves,
berries, and shoots. Diseased leaves get detached from branches and
hang out by means of slimy fungal strands.

"Alarmed at black rot, the Coffee Board is advising growers to
facilitate aeration of plants by clearing weeds, dry leaves, and
mulch," said a senior official.

[The fungus _Corticium koleroga_ (previously _Pellicularia koleroga_,
_Ceratobasidium noxium_) causes thread blight (also called black rot)
of coffee and some other tropical or subtropical woody plants,
including citrus species and henna. Symptoms include dark brown or
black decay and rot of leaves, twigs, and berries followed by
defoliation, berry drop, and dieback. Affected leaves may hang from
strong fungal mycelial threads that can be seen on twigs and petioles.
Whole plantings can be affected resulting in severe crop damage.

Disease development is favoured by heavy rainfall, high atmospheric
humidity (95-100 percent), shade, and overhanging branches. Spread
occurs by wind, water, plant, and other material, as well as
mechanical means (including insect activities). Disease management is
difficult and may include cultural practices (trimming of vegetation
to improve air flow as mentioned above, minimising human activities
during monsoon season to reduce the risk of pathogen spread),
phytosanitation (removal of infected plant material) to reduce
available inoculum, and copper sprays whenever weather conditions
permit.

Other species in the genus cause diseases in different crops, for
example black rot of tea (_C. invisum_ and _C. theae_), thread blight
of cocoa (_C. salmonicolor_) and thread blight of apple (_C.
stevensii_).
