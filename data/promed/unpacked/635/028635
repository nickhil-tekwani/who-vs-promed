A horse previously believed to have contracted Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in Granby [Massachusetts], which prompted state health officials to raise the town's EEE risk level to critical, actually died in Connecticut, where the horse had lived for over a year, according to the horse's owner.

Dan Dali Haber, owner of Mountain View Training Center in Granby, said his horse, an 18-month-old filly named Gabrielle, was stabled in Salem, Connecticut, when she became infected with EEE and later died. Gabrielle had been stabled in the southeastern Connecticut town since March 2018, he said, and had not been in Granby at all between this time and her death.

EEE is a rare but serious mosquito-borne disease that often leads to death or permanent physical and mental disabilities in humans. It is almost always fatal in horses, usually within 3 days.

Gabrielle's death by EEE led the state to designate Granby as at critical risk for EEE, and surrounding communities South Hadley and Belchertown earned a high-risk rating. But Dali Haber says that a mix-up seems to be afoot, calling into question whether these communities should have received critical or high-risk classifications.

"I just think it's very strange they haven't corrected it, and they have us on a huge warning," Dali Haber said.

After Gabrielle's death, Dali Haber said he had his horse brought to Tufts Equine Center for an autopsy, where he believes an error likely occurred because the veterinarians had his information on their paperwork, including his Granby address.

Dali Haber said that he considered whether a different horse in Granby could have contracted the disease, but heard no other reports suggesting an EEE case in town. A Facebook screenshot obtained by the Gazette shows that in an [8 Aug 2019] Facebook post, Dali Haber announced Gabrielle had died. The state's Health and Human Services office website states a Granby horse was stricken by EEE on [8 Aug 2019].

The Gazette reached out to the state on Friday, Monday, and Tuesday [6, 9, and 10 Sep 2019] and was told it would receive a response but did not hear back as of Tuesday [10 Sep 2019].

Dali Haber said he reached out to Tufts Equine Center on [30 Aug 2019], the day after the state announced a Granby horse had died of EEE, to inform them there had been a mistake, and was told the center would reach out to the state. He has received no updates since this time, which he finds concerning.

Granby Board of Health clerk Jeanne Crosby said the board contacted the state to confirm whether the horse that died of EEE lived and died in Connecticut, but did not receive a response as of Tuesday morning [10 Sep 2019].

The critical risk designation the state placed on Granby comes with prevention measures such as canceling outdoor events during peak mosquito hours, which has led to some rescheduling of events in town. In a [20 Aug 2019] statement, the Board of Health wrote it would be "actively restricting outdoor events between the hours of dusk and dawn" due to the critical risk classification.

The Granby school district also posted on its Facebook page it would conduct all student activities between dawn and dusk, and USA Ultimate relocated a planned disc tournament, which had about 400 athletes registered, from Granby to Devens due to the critical risk.

Neighboring communities Belchertown and South Hadley also took precautions in light of their high-risk classifications, with the South Hadley Police Department's Family Movie Night moved indoors. In Belchertown, Director of Public Health Judy Metcalf told the Gazette in August [2019] the town would roll out a "public education campaign" due to the high risk.

State health officials are urging residents of Genesee and Lapeer counties to take extra precautions against mosquitoes after animals with Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) were euthanized.

A deer in Genesee County and a horse in Lapeer County signal an increase in EEE activity in Michigan, which has sickened 7 people and led to 3 deaths.

All of the human cases have occurred in 5 southwest Michigan counties: Barry, Berrien, Cass, Kalamazoo and Van Buren.

Nine unvaccinated horses [in] Barry, Kalamazoo, Lapeer, and St. Joseph counties contracted EEE, along with 5 deer found in Barry, Cass, Genesee, Kalamazoo, and Van Buren counties.

The deer all were euthanized due to the severity of their illnesses.

EEE is the most dangerous mosquito-borne illness with a 33% fatality rate among humans. Children younger than 15 and adults older than 50 are at the greatest risk.

As a result of EEE activity spreading to more counties, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services is advising residents and organizations to cancel, postpone or reschedule any outdoor activity after dusk -- especially if they involve children.

That includes sports practices, games and outdoor music practices. The precautions should continue until a hard frost occurs, which will kill off most mosquitoes.

"Michigan is currently experiencing its worst Eastern equine encephalitis outbreak in more than a decade," said Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, Michigan's chief medical executive and chief deputy for health. "The ongoing cases reported in humans and animals and the severity of this disease illustrate the importance of taking precautions against mosquito bites."

The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services offered the following tips for how people can protect themselves:
- Limit outdoor activities or take precautions to avoid biting when mosquitoes are most active, especially between dusk and dawn.
- Apply an insect repellent that contains DEET, picaridin, or IR3535 according to label instructions. Only use products that are registered by the US Environmental Protection Agency.
- When outdoors, wear socks, long pants, and long-sleeved shirts.
- Make sure windows and doors have tight-fitting screens. Repair or replace screens that have tears or other openings.
- Eliminate all sources of standing water that can support mosquito breeding, including water found in birdbaths, wading pools, and old tires.

Symptoms of EEE include the sudden onset of fever, chills, body and joint aches that can progress to a severe encephalitis. That can result in headache, disorientation, tremors, seizures and paralysis. Permanent brain damage, comas and death are possible in the most severe cases. Anyone experiencing EEE symptoms should see a physician as soon as possible.

[When you do things to protect yourself, such as eliminate standing water where mosquitoes breed, you are also helping to protect your horse. The best protection for your horse(s) is vaccination. It is effective and can be augmented by horse-approved mosquito repellant sprays.

Likely this disease will die out after a hard frost. - Mod.TG
