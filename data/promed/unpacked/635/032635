Project to detect disease outbreak launched
---------------------------------------------
The Government today [8 Nov 2004] launched a mega-project aimed at
detecting disease outbreaks in the country well in advance. "The Integrated
Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) launched today would help notify the
Center and state within 6 hours if a death occurs due to some disease, and
so detect disease outbreak well in advance," Union Health Minister Anbumani
Ramadoss told reporters here today. "It would help study the disease
patterns in the country and identify emerging diseases," he said.
The project, expected to provide essential data to monitor progress of
on-going disease control programs, would also help allocate health
resources more optimally, he added.
Under the project, each district of the country would have a well-equipped
lab with trained personnel and advanced communication facilities so that
they can send "early warning signals" to the higher authorities, he said.
"Initially, the project would be implemented in 9 states to test its
efficacy, and, by 2007, the whole country would be covered," the Minister
said. "Though the Project has 13 core priority areas for the national
surveillance, states could add some more according to their needs," Health
Secretary J.V.R. Prasada Rao said.
The 9 states to be covered include Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh,
Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Tamil Nadu, Mizoram, and Kerala and
cover a total of 206 districts in the 1st phase, he said.

Integrated diseases surveillance project (IDSP) launched, media has an
active role in surveillance: Smt. Laksmi
-------------------------------------------
The Union Health and Family Welfare Minister, Dr. A. Ramadoss, today [8 Nov
2004] launched the Integrated Disease Surveillance Project here,
underlining the fact that the new scheme will bring about a sea change in
understanding disease patterns and in the monitoring of risk factors for
disease control and prevention. Speaking at the inaugural function, the
Minister recalled his 1st day in office when the project was presented to
him, and said that this program caught his imagination from the very start.
This is a much needed program, which will enable notification of a disease
in any part of the country within 6 hours of the outbreak. The Minister
said that, in time, the Disease Surveillance Project will be turned into a
monitoring program for the monitoring and surveillance of health parameters
and the availability of doctors and facilities in the remote parts of the
country.
Speaking on the occasion, the Minister of State for Health and Family
Welfare, Mrs. P. Lakshmi, said that this is a project in which the
government of India and the State governments will join hands to built
capacities to detect and control outbreaks of common communicable diseases.
The project is to be implemented by the States and Union Territories, as
per their needs, in a coordinated and uniform manner. This project would
basically enhance the capacity of each district, so that timely and
effective intervention can be undertaken to control diseases. The Minister
urged private hospitals and practitioners to provide relevant information
on the occurrence of diseases to the District Surveillance Unit so that
outbreaks are identified at an early stage, and many lives can be saved.
She urged the media to play a proactive role in keeping vigil on the
occurrence of diseases.
The IDSP is intended to be the backbone of the public health delivery
system in the country. It aims at establishing a system of surveillance for
communicable and non-communicable diseases, and risk factors, at the state
level. It is also expected to provide essential data to monitor the
progress of ongoing disease control programs and to help allocate health
resources more optimally. It will be able to detect early warning signals
of impending outbreaks and to help initiate an effective response in a
timely manner.
This World Bank-assisted project is being implemented at a total cost of
Rs.408.36 crore [a crore is 10 million -- 408.36 crore rupees is
approximately USD 90 545 454 - Mod.MPP] and will cover all the States and
UTs in a phased manner. Phase-I, starting this year [2004], will cover the
9 States of Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya
Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttranchal, Mizoram, and Tamil Nadu, spread over 206
districts. In Phase-II, 176 districts will be covered in the States of
Gujarat, Haryana, Rajasthan, Orissa, Chattisgarh, West Bengal, Delhi, Goa,
Chandigarh, Manipur, Meghalaya, and Tripura, while the remaining 210
districts will be taken up in Phase-III. The diseases to be covered under
the Project are most of the epidemic diseases, such as Malaria, Cholera,
Typhoid, Plague, TB, Polio, and measles through regular weekly
surveillance. In addition, road traffic accidents and unusual clinical
symptoms, such as meningeoencephalitis/hemorrhagic fever, will also be
included. In addition, the States could potentially identify up to 5
State-specific priority diseases for which public health response is required.

[News of the inauguration of the integrated disease surveillance project
(IDSP) in India is welcome. As one can see from the limited selection of
see also's below for 2003 and 2004, undiagnosed deaths and illnesses in
India are prominent in the ProMED-mail archives. The statement in the title
section of the Ministry of Health Press Release "media has an active role
in surveillance" is a truism, as the vast majority of information on
disease outbreaks in India received and posted by ProMED-mail have been in
the form of newswire articles found during websearches. We very much look
forward to the "fruits" of the implementation of this IDSP in India, with
hopes that we will see fewer "undiagnosed" disease reports and will have
more complete and accurate information from official investigations into
these disease outbreaks. - Mod.MPP]
