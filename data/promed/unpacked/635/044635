A total of 3245 people have tested positive for brucellosis as of Monday [14 Sep 2020], in Lanzhou, Northwest China's Gansu Province, according to an investigation report into the brucellosis antibody positive event in Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute that occurred in December 2019. The report was released by the Health Commission of Lanzhou on Tue 15 Sep 2020, stating that compensation will be carried out in batches in October 2020 to effectively protect people's health and interests.

By Monday [14 Sep 2020], a total of 21 847 people had been tested, of whom 4646 had preliminarily screened positive, and 3245 had been confirmed positive by the Gansu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the report said. It triggered public concern about how the infected people are treated and compensated, which reached the top of the hot research list on Chinese Twitter-like Sina Weibo, with more than 48 million views as of press time.

After the occurrence of the brucellosis antibody positive event in the Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute, 11 public medical institutions have been designated as relevant hospitals, with green channels and specialized clinics to provide free and convenient health testing and standardized treatment, according to the report. Health records have been established for those who tested positive, and specially assigned staff will carry out monthly health follow-ups with the infected people.

Experts are offering on-site counseling, online counseling, along with telephone hotlines, distribution of brochures, and other means for the public to get information about the disease. A total of 3159 people have the new health records. A total of 23 479 consultations were carried out, 9 on-site lectures on medical treatment were held, and more than 15 000 copies of publicity leaflets were distributed.

From [24 Jul 2019 to 20 Aug 2020], Zhongmu Lanzhou biological pharmaceutical factory, near the Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute, used expired disinfectant in the process of brucella vaccine production for animal use, which led to the incomplete sterilization of the waste gas from the production fermentation tank. The waste gas carrying the fermentation liquid containing bacteria formed bacteria-containing aerosols. During the production period, the prevailing wind direction in the region was southeast, and Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute was downwind of the factory and infections occurred as a result. This was an accident, and exposure occurred in a short period of time, the report said.

On [13 Jan 2020], Lanzhou biological pharmaceutical factory had its brucella vaccine production license withdrawn and the product approval document number for brucellosis vaccine (S2 strains) and brucellosis vaccine (A19 strains) were withdrawn on [15 Jan 2020]. A total of 7 veterinary drug product approval numbers were cancelled in the brucellosis vaccine production workshop. The factory shut down the brucellosis vaccine production workshop on [7 Dec 2019]. It said it would learn lessons and actively cooperate with local authorities to deal with the aftermath and compensate for the losses.

Brucellosis, also known as Mediterranean fever, is an infectious bacterial disease affecting human beings caused by _Brucella_. It can be transmitted by contact with infected livestock including cattle and sheep. It is characterized by fever, malaise, and headaches.

[It is not clear how many of the seropositive individuals actually had symptoms of brucellosis related to this outbreak which seems to have been related to an aerosol event related to veterinary vaccine manufacture. - Mod.LL
