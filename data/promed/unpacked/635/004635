Measles is rapidly spreading among adults in the densely populated Zamzam camp for the displaced, near El Fasher [Al Fashir], capital of North Darfur. "More and more adults are stricken, as measles [cases] are being transmitted from the children in the camp," an activist told Radio Dabanga from the camp. "During the past weeks, 7 women, 3 of them breast-feeding, died of the disease.

He appealed via Radio Dabanga to all the displaced in Zamzam to have their children vaccinated at the various health centres in the camp that hosts more than 150 000 displaced.

Last April [2015], Sudanese Ministry of Health, in cooperation with UNICEF and national partners launched a massive campaign to immunise 7.9 million children, aged 6 months to 15 years, against the life-threatening disease.

In one of the worst measles outbreaks in Sudan's recent history that began in the end of 2014, there have been 1730 confirmed cases, 3175 suspected cases, and 22 fatalities, UNICEF stated in a news note on 23 Apr 2015.

The UN World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNICEF will support the Health Ministry to conduct a second response vaccination campaign, targeting about 1.85 million children between 6 months and 15 years of age, in 22 localities in North, South, East, and Central Darfur states. The organisations recommended that the vaccination campaigns should cover all states, and not only affected localities, and should ideally cover the whole country.

A Clallam County [Washington] woman died this spring [2015] due to a measles infection, the Washington state Department of Health said [Thu 2 Jul 2015]. It's the 1st reported measles-related death in the US since 2003 and the 1st in the state of Washington since the 1990s.

The infection wasn't discovered until an autopsy. The official cause of death was pneumonia due to measles.

DOH spokesman Donn Moyer said the woman was likely exposed at a local medical facility during a recent outbreak in Clallam County. She was there at the same time as a person who later developed a rash and was contagious for measles.

Officials say the woman had the D9 strain of the measles, which is common in southeast Asia and is the same strain connected to the Clallam County outbreak.

County health officials say this is not the same strain that was the cause of the measles outbreak at Disneyland.

The woman was dealing with other health conditions and was on medications that weakened her immune system. Moyer said she did not exhibit some of the common symptoms of measles so the infection was not discovered until after she died. They did not say whether she was vaccinated.

Moyer says the woman was moved to the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle, where she died. He says officials are withholding her age to protect her identity, but she wasn't elderly.

There has been much discussion in the state of California concerning the framing of legislation designed to encourage compulsory measles vaccination, but so far not implemented. - Mod.CP]
