With the 2nd wave of avian influenza killing at least 110 migratory birds over the past 2 weeks at Pong Lake [Maharana Pratap Sagar] in Kangra district, Himachal Forest Department on Wednesday [7 Apr 2021] issued an alert in the state and directed all divisional forest officers to maintain active surveillance in their jurisdiction.

Another 11 carcasses of migratory birds were found at Pong Lake on Wednesday [7 Apr 2021] taking the toll to 110 at the wetland due to bird flu. The H5N8 virus strain has been confirmed in the 2nd wave of the outbreak in the hill state.

The deaths have been reported in 2 migratory species namely bar-headed geese and greylag geese at Pong.

At least 5006 migratory birds had died until February [2021] in the 1st wave of avian influenza- H5N1 that had hit Pong wetland.

In a letter to all CCFs [Chief Conservators of Forests] /CFs [Conservators of Forests] and DFOs [Divisional Forest Officers] across the state, HP [Himachal Pradesh] Principal CCF (wildlife)-cum-Chief Wildlife Warden, Archana Sharma on Wednesday [7 Apr 2021] directed to maintain strict vigil in and around wetland areas where migratory birds are present.

All the field officers of HP Forest Department shall report any unnatural behaviour or unnatural death of wild birds or animals to the office of PCCF (WL) [Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Wildlife], the letter said.

The affected birds display symptoms such as tremors, diarrhea, head tilt, and paralysis. The disease spreads quickly causing paralysis and staggering, it stated.

While dealing with dead birds or animals, proper protective measures should be taken like using gloves, masks, etc., and samples of suspected dead birds may be sent to RDDL [Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory] Jalandhar. Advisories from various agencies of the State Government in this regard should be complied with, the letter added.

Rahul Rohane, Deputy Conservator of Forests, Wildlife Division, Hamirpur while talking to The Pioneer said, "Until now, 110 migratory birds have died since [25 Mar 2021] due to bird flu and carcasses of 10 more migratory birds were found on Wednesday [7 Apr 2021] at Pong Lake."

Rohane said that the Pong Lake had been closed for the visitors and the forest guards have been asked to keep a strict vigil in and around the wetland.

Notably, the fresh waterfowl count at Pong Lake has recorded 13 528 birds at the wetland.

Every year, more than one lakh [100 000] migratory birds of over 100 species from Siberia and Central Asia descend on Pong wetland for their winter sojourn.

[The Indian subcontinent has experienced HPAI outbreaks due to H5N1 virus infection in domestic poultry and other birds almost every year since the 1st report in 2006. The subtype H5N8 has been reported since November 2016.

Many bird species share the same habitats or stopovers during their migration. This high density of several susceptible bird species gathering in the same spot results in effective viral transmission, which is likely to happen through the faecal-oral route via surface waters. Lake Pong is on the trans-Himalayan flyway, with more than 220 bird species that have been identified. - Mod.PMB
