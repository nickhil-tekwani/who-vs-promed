re: Exotic diseases, dogs - UK (20030311.0600)
----------------------------------------------
The leishmania story here is of concern. Dog travel is increasing; about 90
000 dogs have entered the UK in 2 years under PETS [Pets Travel Scheme], so
far. It is now common for dogs to enter the UK from endemic areas. I have
dealt, over the past 2 years, with more than 100 confirmed canine
leishmaniasis cases in travelled animals, either through our lab or through
phone advice. This might be an underestimation, I believe.
Unfortunately, the UK has become a base for rehoming stray dogs from Spain;
these dogs are handled through welfare groups. Many enter the country
already on therapy for known infection. So far, we know of 3 cases of
leishmania infection in non-travelled dogs; one of these I dealt with in
some detail; that dog had been in direct contact with a known case of
leishmaniasis.
As far as we know, the classic phlebotomine vectors are not present in the
UK so far, although the northern European range of some species is
extending. We have no foxhounds affected, as far as we know. However, we
have no serosurveys available in the UK of non-travelled animals although I
have surveyed 150 "normal" dogs by polymerase chain reaction for various
exotic pathogens including leishmania. None was positive. No-one has
surveyed the foxhound population here although I have thought about this.
It would be a difficult project as it would be caught up in the politics of
the ban on fox hunting.
Regarding surveillance: this has been a major issue for me and the British
Small Animal Veterinary Association/British Veterinary Association. We have
lobbied the Government for funding with little result because of the
perceived lack of risk (the phlebotomine vector being absent) and despite
me making very strong points about the North American experience of
transmission. So far, all we have managed is a short term voluntary
recording scheme of illness in travelled animals which is being supported
by Government infrastructure. Details are available on the DEFRA website;
it has been named DACTARI (Dog And Cat Travel And Risk Information).

[Shipping homeless dogs from country to country is an efficient way of
spreading diseases of all sorts. And frankly it is not an epidemiological
dimension I had considered when this subject of terminating the UK
quarantine first came up. The UK recorded prevalence of 100/2 cases per 45
000 imports per year is about what one might expect for reported incidents
in relation to limited exposure. As stated, the reality is probably higher.
As these touring dogs (not the Spanish strays) are by definition "healthy",
though some will also be elderly, one might expect some spontaneous
regression occurring. As we get climate change, phlebotomine flies will
eventually reach the UK to breed. - Mod. MHJ]
