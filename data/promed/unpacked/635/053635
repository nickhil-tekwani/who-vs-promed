A third case of BSE has been described in Belgium. It is difficult to
continue to describe these Belgian cases as 'sporadic' or 'isolated'. The
case occurred in a herd in Waarschoot in the same part of the country as the
previous case. The 124 other cows of the herd have been destroyed and their
brains are being investigated.

BELGIUM FINDS THIRD MAD COW CASE, DESTROYS HERD

BRUSSELS -- Belgium's farm authorities were cited as saying today that a
third case of mad cow disease had been discovered in the northwest of the
country, leading to the destruction of a 124-strong herd of cattle.
Government veterinarians examined a five-year-old cow on March 9, confirming
BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) earlier today. The European
Commission and other European Union members had been informed, the farm
ministry said in a statement.
