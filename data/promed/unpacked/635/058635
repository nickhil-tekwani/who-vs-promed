RABIES - USA (08): SOLDIERS, RABIES EXPOSURE EVALUATION

A Fort Drum, N.Y. soldier who recently returned from Afghanistan died
from rabies after contracting the disease from a feral dog while
deployed [see also: ProMED-mail report: Rabies - USA (07): (NY)
soldier, RFI 20110824.2577].

The Army has initiated an investigation to ensure that other service
members who may have been exposed to rabies are identified and receive
preventive treatment, if needed.

The Army Medical Department along with the Department of Defense
(DOD), other uniformed services and the national Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention are working together to expeditiously identify,
evaluate and treat any service members, DOD civilians and contractors
who may have been exposed to rabies while deployed. Individuals who
have already been identified as being exposed to the disease while
deployed are currently receiving appropriate evaluation and treatment.


The importance of receiving appropriate medical evaluation following
contact with a feral/stray animal cannot be overstated. Rabies may not
show any signs or symptoms in the infected animal until late in the
disease, often just days before its death. The animal can, however,
still spread the deadly virus while appearing completely normal.

The rabies virus is transmitted to humans by the saliva of infected
animals through bite wounds, contact with mucous membranes or broken
skin. Humans can become infected and harbor the virus for weeks to
months, and in extremely rare cases, years before becoming ill. During
this incubation period, which averages between one and 3 months,
rabies can be prevented with appropriate treatment, including a series
of vaccinations. Once symptoms occur, however, death is almost always
certain.

All previously deployed Service Members (Active or Reserve Component,
as well as those recently discharged from military service); DOD
civilians and contractors who have had contact with a feral/stray
animal while deployed should be immediately evaluated by medical
personnel. Army Medicine and the DOD are committed to ensuring that
anyone who believes they may have been exposed while deployed is
provided with appropriate medical evaluation and care.

The Army Medical Department and the DOD are dedicated to ensuring the
health and well-being of all Service Members, DOD civilians and
contractors.

We ask the friends and families of those returning from a deployment
after March 2010 to encourage anyone that may have been exposed to
seek medical attention, even if no symptoms are readily apparent.

Call the Wounded Warrior & Family Hotline at 1-800-984-8523 (Stateside
DSN: 421-3700 or Overseas DSN: 312-421-3700) for information on
obtaining a medical evaluation and, if necessary, treatment.

[Previously, on 24 Aug 2011, it was reported that a Fort Drum soldier
was being treated for rabies virus infection, possibly contracted
during service overseas (ProMED-mail archived post number 20110824.2577). The soldier did not respond to treatment and died on 4
Sep 2011. According to a subsequent statement, the decorated
24-year-old soldier from Livermore, California was from the 10th
Mountain Division. He was an army cook, and was deployed with the
615th Military Police Company in Afghanistan for a year that ended in
May 2011. Exactly how and where he contracted the illness was under
investigation. But military officials say he did not get the rabies in
New York.

It is now confirmed that the soldier was bitten by a feral dog in
Afghanistan and presumably did not receive post-exposure prophylaxis
at that time. The Army policy document reproduced above is a direct
consequence of this unfortunate event. - Mod.CP]
