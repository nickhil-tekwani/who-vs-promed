"From today, emergency measures against the disease lumpy skin disease [LSD] have been introduced in Northern Bulgaria, namely in the districts of Vidin, Montana, Vratsa, Pleven, Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Lovech, Razgrad, Targovishte, Shumen, Ruse, Dobrich, Silistra and Varna. The movement of cattle in these areas is not prohibited, but is carried out under increased scrutiny." This was announced by the executive director of the Bulgarian Food Safety Agency [BFSA], Dr. Damyan Iliev, in a news conference, where he presented updated information on the epizootic situation in the country and steps undertaken by the Food Safety Agency in relation to identified outbreaks of lumpy skin disease. He said that a new outbreak of the disease has been detected in the village Vodenicharovo in the Stara Zagora province, adjacent to the primary outbreaks in the villages Voden and Chernogorovo in the province Haskovo.

Dr Iliev added that farmers must follow the instructions published earlier by BFSA, available on the Agency's website: the main and urgent step is combatting the vectors. It is forbidden to transport cattle in southern Bulgaria, except for animals that are moved to a slaughterhouse for immediate slaughter. Weekly clinical examinations of cattle must be carried out across the country. Dr Iliev added that the holding of animal markets and cattle exhibitions are forbidden. Cattle owners must immediately inform the official veterinarian doctor of any suspected disease cases or mortalities. "It is possible that the cause of the disease is a criminal movement of animals, although this is not confirmed so far," said Dr Iliev. "In addition to the restrictions published above, vector control measures by spraying are being applied in relation to all flying vectors in the Struma and Maritsa river-basins, bordering Turkey and Greece," said the Director of the National Veterinary Services.

Dr. Damyan Iliev explained that currently no LSD vaccination is to be applied. According to him, the main reason not to vaccinate animals is a [EU] ban on the movement of cattle and trade in their products within the EU for a minimum of 3 years if vaccination is performed. This will lead to major economic losses. "The vaccine used against LSD also does not provide the expected results. In Greece, where vaccination has been performed, new outbreaks are still reported," said Dr. Daman Iliev. He pointed out that up to the end of 2015, 451 LSD outbreaks have been recoded in Turkey, and 116 in Greece. Since the beginning of this year [2016], 11 new outbreaks have been recorded in Turkey and 3 in Greece. The disease is transmitted very easily, as the main transmitters are bloodsucking insects (Culicoides, flies, mosquitoes, ticks), while spread by contact between animals can be transported mechanically. Dr Iliev is confident that the only way to stop the spread of the disease in the country is by euthanizing and burial of herds with infected animals. "So minimizing the likelihood of vectors (insects) to transmit the virus from diseased animals," he added.

[According to the DEFRA (UK) updated (15 Apr 2016) "Preliminary Outbreak Assessment" of LSD in Bulgaria and Greece, 2 of the affected premises in Bulgaria are backyard farms, just 5 km [about 3 miles] from each other, while the 3rd focus, also a backyard farm, is located in a village without other livestock. Clinical signs of skin nodules (no scabs) were observed in the animals. In Greece, 3 outbreaks have been reported in the Serres region, in Northern Greece, affecting unvaccinated cattle. These are the 1st outbreaks this year (2016) in Greece and are in an area which had not previously reported disease. The DEFRA assessment further says that no approved vaccine is available in the EU for prevention of LSD, but under emergency procedures, a South African vaccine may be used; in this case, Intervet's "Lumpyvax". The DEFRA doc VITT/1200 "Lumpy Skin Disease in Greece and Bulgaria" is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/517110/lumpy-skin-bulgaria-greece-april16.pdf.

Greece has submitted its follow-up no. 10, including the details of the 3 new LSD outbreaks in Serres, close to the Bulgarian border, on 15 Apr 2016; see, with an interactive map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=20047. The latest previous LSD outbreak in Greece dates back to early December 2015. This inter-seasonal pause seems to have terminated now. The location of the Bulgarian foci is about 100 km [about 60 miles] from the Turkish and Greek borders. The LSD epizootic started in eastern Turkey in September 2013, reaching the Edirne district, only 8 km [about 5 miles] from the Greek borders, in June 2015. The 1st outbreak in Greece was reported in August 2015.

For the emergency vaccination of susceptible cattle within and around the affected region, the Greek veterinary services have opted to apply a freeze-dried, live attenuated virus (Neethling strain) vaccine. A similar vaccine has recently been applied in Israel (see ProMED-mail post 20150926.3672096). As reported in another posting (20150929.3676992), CODA-CERVA (Belgium) in partnership with the Pirbright laboratory (UK) were coordinating a project on the comparison of LSD vaccines. The project was, reportedly, planned to address 6 different vaccines, including live attenuated LSD vaccines, live attenuated sheep pox or goat pox vaccines, and newly developed inactivated vaccines. It will be helpful to be informed of the advance attained in the mentioned comparative project. Useful relevant information is available in Ref 1.

Results of the vaccination with the "newly developed inactivated vaccines" are of particular interest. Subscribers are referred to the 2012 LSD review authored by Pirbright's experts (Ref 1), where (citing Kitching, 1983) they state: "The use of inactivated vaccines could be considered as a short term solution in an emergency; however, the protection provided by inactivated vaccines is not solid and is only short lived."

In relation to the trade restrictions of the EU, related to vaccination, subscribers are referred to the recent paper addressing an assay for the differentiation between an Israeli field LSD virus and Neethling vaccine virus (Ref 2), including its following (summarized) abstract:

"During vaccination programs it is essential for veterinary services and farmers to be able to distinguish between animals affected by the cattle-borne virulent viruses and vaccinated animals, subsequently affected by the vaccine strain. This study describes an improved high resolution-melting (HRM) test that exploits a 27 base pair (bp) fragment of the LSDV126 extracellular enveloped virion (EEV) gene that is present in field viruses but is absent from the Neethling vaccine strain. This difference leads to (about) 0.5 Centigrade melting point change in the HRM assay, when testing the quantitative PCR (qPCR) products generated from the virulent field viruses compared to the attenuated vaccine. By exploiting this difference, it could be shown using the newly developed HRM assay that virus isolated from vaccinated cattle that developed disease symptoms behave similarly to vaccine virus control, indicating that the vaccine virus can induce disease symptoms. This assay is not only in full agreement with the previously published PCR gradient and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) tests but it is faster with, fewer steps, cheaper and dependable."

The prospects of success in the full control (eradication) of LSD applying a stamping out policy without vaccination are debatable.
