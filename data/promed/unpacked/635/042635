CDC, FDA, and USDA are cooperating in an ongoing investigation of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Thompson illnesses that may be linked to a concurrent outbreak in the Netherlands. The US investigation began last month (September 2012) into 85 cases of a single genetic type of _S._ Thompson that were reported by 27 states since 1 Jul 2012, according to CDC spokesperson Lola Russell. 10 people have been hospitalized; there have been no deaths. This is a fairly common strain of _S._ Thompson, and CDC would normally expect to see approximately 30 "background" cases during the same period.

The epidemiological investigation into the source of the 85 illnesses is being carried out by the various state health agencies in cooperation with CDC. It would not be surprising, according to CDC, if some of the 85 cases are found to be unrelated to the outbreak. CDC is not yet ready to release a list of the affected states; however, eFoodAlert has learned that the following states are in the process of investigating one or more _S._ Thompson illnesses:

Alabama: 1 case
Arizona: 1 case; a child
Colorado: 2 cases
Illinois: 2 cases
Maryland: 10 cases; age range 5 years to 77 years; most cases in the Baltimore metropolitan area
Nebraska: 6 cases; age range is 3 months to 61 years; 2 people hospitalized; illnesses reported from the east central region of Nebraska
New Hampshire: 1 case; an adult resident of Rockingham County who was hospitalized, but has since recovered
New York: 4 cases; no geographic cluster
Texas: 1 case
Virginia: 1 case

The outbreak strain appears to be the same as the strain that is behind the Dutch outbreak, and CDC is recommending that the public avoid eating smoked salmon originating from the Dutch producer.

On 28 Sep 2012, the Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority announced the recall of smoked salmon manufactured by Foppen Paling en Zalm and sold through major supermarket chains, including Aldi and Albert Heijn. On 1 Oct 2012, the Netherlands issued an alert through the EU Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed, notifying member countries that a sample of smoked salmon originating from Greece was contaminated with _S._ Thompson. Associated Press reports that the contaminated smoked salmon was processed at Foppen's factory in Greece.

Foppen has initiated a recall of the following products, sorted by retailer:

The implicated product was sold in the USA through Costco, under both the Foppen and Kirkland brands. FDA is working to determine whether any other retailers in the USA carried the Foppen smoked salmon.

The recalled products were exported to a number of countries in addition to the USA, including Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Mexico, Switzerland, and Taiwan. The China Post reported today that Costco Wholesale Corp has withdrawn all smoked salmon processed by Foppen from its Taiwan stores.

Even though CDC and state health authorities have not yet established a link between the smoked salmon and this outbreak strain, CDC recommends that the public should not consume smoked salmon products manufactured by Foppen at this time.
