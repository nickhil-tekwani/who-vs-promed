Local Outbreak of African Swine Fever Eradicated in a Settlement of
Rostovskaya Oblast
---------------------------
Mortality in pigs was reported on the pig farm
OOO "Romanovka" in the Salsky Rayon of the
Rostovskaya Oblast. Lesions of internal organs
typical of African swine fever (ASF) were
detected in dead animals after autopsy.
Laboratory analysis of pathological material
detected African swine fever virus. All pigs in
the settlement of Romanovka (1875 animals on the
farm OOO "Romanovka" and 268 animals in private
backyards) were subject to bloodless destruction
and incineration. All roads in the settlement
were disinfected, quarantine was imposed;
veterinary and police posts were established
along the roads of the rayon, disinfection
barriers were imposed, earth roads leading to the
settlement were turned over.

[The above outbreak has been reported by Russia in its OIE follow-up
report Number 15, dated 2 Apr 2009. (See at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=6546>).
It notified the death of 32 pigs out of 32 cases; no details on the
number of susceptible animals in the Romanovka village, nor
information on their fate were included. The current official
information fills in that gap, reporting the culling of 1875 animals
on the affected farm and 268 in private backyards.

Following its initial introduction into Georgia,
reportedly during the 1st quarter of 2007, ASF
has been spreading alarmingly in the Caucasus
region, continuing its northwards march in south
Russia. Initially affecting the territories of
Georgia, Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia, and
Azerbaijan, ASF penetrated Russia in November 2007.

The Russian epizootic has, by now, been reported
from the territories of Chechnya, North
Ossetia-Alania, Ingushetia, Orenburg (outside the
Caucasus; reportedly, wildlife affected), the
Stavropolskiy Kray (Stavropol), the Krasnodarskiy
Kray (Krasnodar), and now further westwards into
the Rostovskaya Oblast which has common borders
with Ukraine (see map above in OIE follow-up report 15).

As of 2 Apr 2009 the total number of outbreaks
reported to the OIE (World Organisation for
Animal Health) by Russia since the start of its
epizootic on 5 Nov 2007, had reached 57. Stopping
the march of ASF will require more than "Modified
stamping out," applied until recently. Is the
current stamping-out indicative of a move in a new direction?

Useful information on the recommended policy may
be found in the 2007 SDC mission (to Georgia)
report, archived 20070920.3131. - Mod.AS]
