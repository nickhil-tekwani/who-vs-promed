This has been bothering me since we posted Deirdre Blair Brennan's message:
[CJD, optical equipment multiple use ban - UK (02) 991025220211 "I was
surprised to read that optical equipment is used on multiple persons in the
UK. I wonder if this is the case in the US and whether there is a
disinfecting process in between patients? My Benenson [reference indicates
autoclaving of surgical instruments between uses to avoid CJD transmission,
so I guess there is a disinfection process in place but is it deemed
inadequate to stop CJD transmission?" and the replies from Mel Steiger and
from Steve Toovey [CJD, optical equipment multiple use ban - UK (03)
991026235327 that things are changing insofar as may be reused and what
may not. So I thought I would get it off my chest and post it at a time of
year when no one might be reading ProMED-mail. I am not hoping we can get
a long-winded and multiple-post diatribe going but it seems worthwhile to
ask further questions about equipment that is reused and, perhaps,
shouldn't be.
Given what we now think we know about prions and other subviral infectious
agents, how safe is multiuse equipment? Years ago a CDC employee, Walter
Bond, published a series of articles that included high-magnification
photos of "cleaned and disinfected" reusable medical devices such as
endoscopes (proctoscopes, gastroscopes, laproscopes, etc.). It was
apparent from the photos in those articles that these items, after thorough
"cleaning" were anything but clean. At that time it was presumed that,
although these pieces of equipment were not clean, they were disinfected,
sterile. There was a report (cannot recall where I saw it) of concern
about a gastroscope used in a procedure on an individual who later died and
was found to have had CJD.
New Scientist Here published a paper suggesting (I'd hate to use the word
"indicating") that heating enhances infectivity of prions
<http://www.newscientist.com/ns/19990213/newsstory7.html.>
Procedures involving reusable invasive medical equipment, particularly that
equipment which by the nature of its design does not allow for thorough
cleaning, could be sources of inoculation with known, or yet to be
discovered, subviral etiologic agents. Those with long incubation periods,
such as CJD, and perhaps involving other disease cofactors would draw the
attention of investigators only under very unique circumstances (as did
CJD). Reusable invasive devises are often not employed unless there is an
indication (risk group, perceived or real) of an infectious disease. All
these individuals are subjected to initial and then more frequent invasive
procedures (inoculations?) involving multiple use equipment.
The New York Times reported
<http://www.nytimes.com/library/national/science/health/111099hth-medical-re
use.html> on the multiple reuse of biopsy needles, scissors, catheters,
wires, balloons, etc. that are employed for coronary studies but are not
labeled as re-useable. Assuming these reused supplies have been sterilized
by standard methods, and that those methods are inadequate for elimination
of infections agents except prions, one can assume that as the number of
nvCJD cases increases, so might the spread of this disease.
So, what I would like to know is (a) are there any on-going studies of the
generation of prions by heat-treatment and (b) does the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration have a policy recommending use of disposable supplies
"whenever possible" (i.e., when such supplies are manufactured and
available)? Seems to me that the cost might not be as high as has been
suggested. If disposable supplies could be manufactured, manufacturers
would be paying a great deal in the way of taxes, allowing the government
the opportunity to effectively subsidize the changeover.
Alternatively, perhaps this is not a problem. If someone knowledgeable on
this subject would care to comment, directly to me
<calisher@promedmail.org>, I would be grateful.
