re: ProMED-mail. Anthrax - Italy: (LZ) bovine, OIE 20180317.5693776
The case occurred on the same pasture involved in the outbreak reported at the end of August 2017 [see Anthrax - Italy (02): (LZ) comment 20170901.5289951]. The bovine animal belonged to a herd of unvaccinated cattle which were grazing on that pasture. The laboratory diagnosis was made at Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale del Lazio e della Toscana, Rome, Italy. Preliminary diagnosis by microscopic examination of blood smears stained with polychrome methylene blue (McFadyen's reaction) was confirmed by cultures and PCR (chromosomal target, pXO1, and pXO2 plasmidic targets).

[Heartfelt thanks to Antonio in Rome. Most helpful comments.

It is a sad constant with anthrax in livestock that owners will procrastinate in the face of serious risk and put off and put off vaccinating their animals, and then be surprised when their animals come down with this disease. Every veterinary officer I know who has dealt with anthrax has identical stories. The good news is that it becomes common knowledge and the gossip will persuade farmers to vaccinate their stock. The bad news is that the re-contamination of soils delays the date when the area can be declared free. In and around this farm they will be compulsorily vaccinating for the next few years until it is clear that the risk no longer exists.

In 2017 Antonio commented on that outbreak, same farm, as follows: the area is an historical anthrax site and pastures are located in the crater of an extinct volcano, not far from the Albano Lake, itself a lake of volcanic origin. Anthrax cases in livestock living in the area are considered absolutely sporadic nowadays, thanks to the intense vaccine prevention measures of the past decades (from the late 1950s). The 2017 outbreak may have been favored by the severe drought ongoing in central Italy. This is the only outbreak notified in 2017 in the Latium region. - Mod.MHJ
