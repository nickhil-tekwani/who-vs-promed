FDA approves vaccine for use after known or suspected anthrax exposure
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The US Food and Drug Administration today [23 Nov 2015] approved a new indication for BioThrax (anthrax vaccine adsorbed) to prevent disease following suspected or confirmed exposure to _Bacillus anthracis_, the bacterium that causes anthrax disease. The vaccine's new use is approved for people 18 through 65 years of age in conjunction with recommended antibiotic treatment. BioThrax was initially approved by the FDA in 1970 for the prevention of anthrax disease in persons at high risk of exposure.

Anthrax disease, especially the inhalation form, is often fatal if not promptly treated. Anthrax is considered one of the more likely agents to be used in a biological attack, primarily because its spores are very stable and easy to disperse. Although it is rare, people may contract anthrax disease through natural exposures, such as contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products.

"With today's approval of BioThrax, we now have a vaccine that can be used, together with antibiotic treatment, to prevent disease after exposure to anthrax spores," said Karen Midthun, MD, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.

BioThrax is the 1st vaccine to receive approval based on the Animal Rule. The Animal Rule allows animal efficacy data to be used as a basis for approval when human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible.

Protective antibody levels, which were determined in rabbit and monkey studies, were used to predict efficacy in humans based on an assessment of the extent of antibody response achieved in human study participants. A 70 percent probability of survival in animal models from inhalational anthrax disease was deemed a reasonable level of protection and likely to provide reasonable benefit in humans.

The ability of BioThrax to increase the probability of survival after stopping post-exposure antibiotic treatment was assessed in rabbits. Rabbits treated with both antibiotics and BioThrax had a survival rate of 70 to 100 percent, depending on the vaccine dose administered. In contrast, in 2 studies of rabbits that received only antibiotic treatment, survival rates were 44 and 23 percent respectively.

The safety and antibody responses to BioThrax in humans were evaluated in a multi-center study conducted in the United States. Subcutaneous (under the skin) injections were given to 200 healthy adults in 3 doses at 0, 2, and 4 weeks. The majority of study participants generated antibody responses that correlated to a 70 percent probability of survival that was observed in animal models.

The observed adverse reactions were comparable with those observed when BioThrax is used for pre-exposure disease prevention. The safety profile for BioThrax is well-established, with the majority of localized adverse events reported as tenderness, pain, swelling, and redness at the injection site, as well as limited movement of the injected arm. The most common systemic adverse reactions were muscle aches, headache, and fatigue.

BioThrax is manufactured by Emergent BioDefense Operations Lansing LLC, based in Lansing, Michigan.

The FDA, an agency within the US Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines, and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation's food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.

1st-ever vaccine approved via the FDA's bioterror pathway
---------------------------------------------------------
A 45-year-old anthrax vaccine gained approval for a new use [Mon 23 Nov 2015] through a regulatory path never before applied by the Food and Drug Administration for this kind of product.

The vaccine is BioThrax, which hit the market in 1970 to protect against anthrax infections for people at high risk of exposure to the deadly bacterium. The FDA says the vaccine, which is made by Emergent BioSolutions of Gaithersburg, Maryland, can now also be used for what is called post-exposure prophylaxis in people aged 18 to 65. If a person is suspected or confirmed to have come into contact with _Bacillus anthracis_, BioThrax can be given in conjunction with the antibiotics that have made up the standard treatment regimen.

The FDA gave the green light using the so-called Animal Rule, a tool devised in 2002, shortly after the 9/11 attacks, to help bring to market medical countermeasures in instances where efficacy cannot be ethically or feasibly tested in humans.

Anthrax fits that bill. The pathogen is high on the list of feared bioterror weapons and was the cause of the worst biological attack in US history. In the autumn of 2001, a number of letters laced with anthrax spores were sent to several congressional offices and media outlets. 17 people were infected and 5 died.

Dr Amesh Adalja, a senior associate at the UPMC Center for Health Security in Baltimore, Maryland, welcomed the approval of the new indication for BioThrax, though he noted it won't change clinical practice. The vaccine was used on an off-label basis in 2001 on the belief it would help those already exposed to anthrax.

Emergent BioSolutions conducted safety testing in people but turned to rabbits to provide the FDA with evidence that giving the vaccine after exposure to anthrax increased the chances of survival. The survival rate for rabbits treated with both antibiotics and BioThrax was 70 percent to 100 percent, depending on the vaccine dose used; rabbits only treated with antibiotics had a far lower survival rate -- 44 percent and 23 percent in 2 different studies -- according to the FDA. The company also showed in humans and monkeys that the vaccine produced an immune response against anthrax.

The Animal Rule was established to help the manufacturers find a way to provide the FDA with evidence that drugs and vaccines might be effective against diseases that are among the most lethal for people. A company making a vaccine to protect against respiratory syncytial virus -- which causes a cold-like illness -- can give people the vaccine then expose them to the virus to see if they are protected. But that kind of testing will never take place for deadly threats like Ebola, anthrax, or SARS.

Companies developing vaccines against other dangerous pathogens will likely be heartened by the news that a vaccine has finally made it through the FDA's review process using the Animal Rule. (9 other therapies to combat bacterial, chemical, and radiological threats have been approved using the regulatory pathway, but never before a vaccine.) Every time the Animal Rule is used, Adalja said, the path becomes clearer for others.

[BioThrax was originally designed as a pre-exposure human vaccine and did its job well, though some military complained at the discomfort involved (see links below). The standard procedure for post-exposure to a possible anthrax aerosol involved some 60 days of ciprofloxacin oral antibiotic, which frankly carried a very high risk of a _Clostridium difficile_ infection, which can be lethal; from personal experience _C. difficile_ infection is also very painful and can involve peritonitis.

The vegetative form of _Bacillus anthracis_ is very sensitive to antibiotics but in a clinical case it does nothing to remove the anthrax toxins. However, thanks to the various heroin related outbreaks in the UK we now know how to efficiently deal with the toxins. But that still leaves those who have yet to show symptoms and are incubating the disease. This new protocol of vaccine and antibiotics is full of common sense and will reduce antibiotic exposure to just a matter of a week or 2 max, while the basic 3 vaccinations are given at 10 day intervals.

I wish we had a similar vaccine for veterinary use during an outbreak, as Sterne, an excellent livestock vaccine, is live and therefore, if given simultaneously, will lose some of the initial dose, unless the antibiotics are given first and after 7 days, when the titre has fallen, the animals can be vaccinated. It would be more efficient if the animals just had to be collected up and run once through the chute. - Mod.MHJ]

[This is a new indication, not a new vaccine. The vaccine was often recommended in the post-exposure setting even in the absence of the FDA indication. Also, given the time required to elicit antibody response and the predicted suboptimal response rate, it will not eliminate the need for post-exposure antibiotic prophylaxis. - Mod.LM]
