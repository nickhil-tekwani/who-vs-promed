Dr Mark Horton, director of the California Department of Public
Health (CDPH), today [5 Dec 2007] warned consumers not to drink
Metromint brand flavored water because it may be contaminated with a
bacterium called _Bacillus cereus_, a microorganism that may cause
vomiting or diarrhea. Soma Beverage Co., LLC., of San Francisco is
voluntarily recalling all bottles of Metromint brand flavored water
(Peppermint, Spearmint, Orangemint, and Lemonmint) with a "Best
Before" date prior to 2008/12/21 (21 Dec 2008) and produced at its
California facility because they may be contaminated with "B.
cereus_. The "Best Before" date is on the shoulder of the bottle. The
product was distributed nationwide to grocery stores, including those
in California, and sold on the Internet.

There have been no confirmed illnesses in California associated with
this product to date. There is an illness complaint in Illinois that
is possibly linked to consumption of this product.

The products were packaged in clear plastic 16.9 ounce (0.5 l)
bottles with a black M on the front and the lettering "KSA" in a
rectangle located on back of the bottle in the lower right-hand
corner. The products were sold at the following locations in Northern
California: Albertson's, Andronico's, Berkeley Bowl, BevMo!, Brown
and Cole, Central Markets, Cost Plus World Market, Draeger's,
Elephant Pharmacy, Fiesta Markets, Fred Meyer, Food Emporium, Haggen,
Harmon's (UT), Lunardi's, Marlene's, Super Supplements, Mollie
Stone's, New Seasons, PCC, Pharmaca, PW Markets, QFD, Rosauers,
Safeway, Thriftway, Top Foods, Town and Country, Uwajimaya, Whole
Foods Market, Wild Oaks Market, Yokes, and Zupans.

In Southern California, the products are sold at AJ's Fine Foods,
Albertson's, Baron's Markets, BevMo!, Bristol Farms, Clark's
Nutrition, Cost Plus World Market, Erewhon Market, Fry's, Gelson's,
Henry's, Jensen's, Jimbo's Naturally, Lazy Acres, Mother's Market,
New Frontiers, One World Fine Foods, Organic To Go, Pacific Coast
Greens, Pavillions, Pharmaca, Ralph's, Sprouts, Sunflower, Vitality
Juice and Java Bar, Vons, Wally's Win and Spirits, Wild Oats Market,
and Whole Foods Market.

Illness caused by _Bacillus cereus_ may be either a vomiting or a
diarrheal type. The vomiting type is characterized by nausea and
vomiting within 30 minutes to 6 hours after consumption of
contaminated foods. Duration of symptoms is generally less than 24
hours. The diarrheal type usually includes onset of abdominal cramps
and watery diarrhea 6 to 15 hours after consumption of contaminated
food. Symptoms may last for 24 to 48 hours.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is urging consumers to
steer clear of 2 types of Metromint water. The CFIA released a
statement Friday [7 Dec 2007] saying San Francisco-based Soma
Beverage Co. is recalling its Metromint flavored water products sold
in the USA. The CFIA says 2 of those flavors, spearmint and
peppermint, were distributed across Canada and are also being recalled.

The agency says the water may be contaminated with _Bacillus cereus_,
which can cause vomiting and diarrhea. No illnesses have been
reported in Canada.

The Metromint products have a best before date of 21 Dec 2008 and are
sold in clear 500 milliliter plastic bottles with a black M on the front.

[The following is extracted from the FDA Bad Bug Book
(<http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/chap12.html>):

"_Bacillus cereus_ is a Gram positive, facultatively aerobic
sporeformer whose cells are large rods and whose spores do not swell
the sporangium. These and other characteristics, including
biochemical features, are used to differentiate and confirm the
presence of _B. cereus_, although these characteristics are shared
with _B. thuringiensis_ and _B. anthracis_. Differentiation of these
organisms depends upon determination of motility (most _B. cereus_
are motile), presence of toxin crystals (_B. thuringiensis_),
hemolytic activity (_B. cereus_ and others are beta hemolytic whereas
_B. anthracis_ is usually nonhemolytic.

Nature of acute disease
-----------------------
_B. cereus_ food poisoning is the general description, although the 2
recognized types of illness are caused by 2 distinct metabolites. The
diarrheal type of illness is caused by a large molecular weight
protein, while the vomiting (emetic) type of illness is believed to
be caused by a low molecular weight, heat-stable peptide.

Nature of disease
-----------------
The symptoms of _B. cereus_ diarrheal type food poisoning mimic those
of _Clostridium perfringens_ food poisoning. The onset of watery
diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and pain occurs 6-15 hours after
consumption of contaminated food. Nausea may accompany diarrhea, but
vomiting (emesis) rarely occurs. Symptoms persist for 24 hours in
most instances.

The emetic type of food poisoning is characterized by nausea and
vomiting within 0.5 to 6 h after consumption of contaminated foods.
Occasionally, abdominal cramps and/or diarrhea may also occur.
Duration of symptoms is generally less than 24 h. The symptoms of
this type of food poisoning parallel those caused by _Staphylococcus
aureus_ foodborne intoxication. Some strains of _B. subtilis_ and _B.
licheniformis_ have been isolated from lamb and chicken incriminated
in food poisoning episodes. These organisms demonstrate the
production of a highly heat stable toxin which may be similar to the
vomiting type toxin produced by _B. cereus_.

The presence of large numbers of _B. cereus_ (greater than 100 000
organisms/g) in a food is indicative of active growth and
proliferation of the organism and is consistent with a potential
hazard to health.

Associated foods
----------------
A wide variety of foods including meats, milk, vegetables, and fish
have been associated with the diarrheal type food poisoning. The
vomiting-type outbreaks have generally been associated with rice
products [this is why the disease can be associated with Chinese
restaurants when the steamed rice is not properly stored - Mod.LL];
however, other starchy foods such as potato, pasta and cheese
products have also been implicated. Food mixtures such as sauces,
puddings, soups, casseroles, pastries, and salads have frequently
been incriminated in food poisoning outbreaks."

Two other important points regarding _B. cereus_ can be made. First,
_B. cereus_ emetic toxin disease can be fatal. As an example, a 1997
publication (1) reported a severe disease in a physician and his son
after eating spaghetti and pesto sauce that had been prepared several
days earlier. Both developed liver failure and rhabdomyolysis and the
son died. It was found that the emetic toxin inhibited mitochondrial
fatty acid oxidation. Second, a few reports have surfaced regarding
fatal pneumonia in a few Texas and Louisiana metal workers that was
caused by B. cereus_ that contained the _B. anthracis_ genes for
toxin and capsule production (2).
