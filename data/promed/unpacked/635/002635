----------------------------------------------------------------------
Public Health Agency of Canada response:

The _Salmonella_ Enteritidis outbreak strains associated with the 2 investigations are not related by WGS [whole genome sequencing]. In Canada, all cases of _Salmonella_ are characterized by WGS in real time (and analyzed by wgMLST [whole genome multi locus sequence typing]). There was a recall associated with the earlier outbreak investigation with cases between April and June 2017, see the following link http://goo.gl/QCj7xw.

Based on the investigation findings to date for the current outbreak, exposure to frozen raw breaded chicken products has emerged as a source of illness. The outbreak investigation is ongoing, and the Public Health Notice will be updated as the investigation evolves. There are currently no product recalls associated with the current investigation.
