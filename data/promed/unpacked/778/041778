Swedish officials are trying to find the source of a national outbreak of _Salmonella_ that has affected more than 30 people. From late August [2021] up to mid-September [2021], 31 people across the country have fallen sick with _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Coeln infections. The source of infection is suspected to be a food with a wide distribution in Sweden.

Whole genome sequencing has shown patients had the same type of _Salmonella_ Coeln, which means it is likely they were infected by a common source.

Those sick range in age from 0 to 85 years old with a median age of 28. They live in 12 different regions in Sweden and 18 are men. Local infection control units and municipalities are involved in the outbreak investigation with the Swedish Food Agency (Livsmedelsverket) and Public Health Agency of Sweden (Folkhalsomyndigheten).

The number of people affected by _Salmonella_ Coeln in Sweden in 2020 and 2019 was in single figures.
