Five days after sick chicks led to the fair's poultry barn being put under
quarantine, the remaining chickens were allowed to return to their home
farms. However, they will remain under quarantine at individual quarters.
The birds are not allowed to be exhibited at other fairs during the
quarantine time.
Dr. Bruce Schmucker, a veterinarian with the Department of Agriculture's
Harrisburg office, said the quarantine will be for at least 3 weeks, but
the lifting of it "is not date specific." The quarantine will be lifted at
each farm when an inspector determines there is no longer a risk for
disease.
Tissue and histological tests showed that up to 10 dead chickens contracted
infectious laryngotracheitis, an upper respiratory infection that can also
be contracted by pheasants and peafowl.
The virus does not affect humans, although it can be carried on shoes and
clothing to other chickens.
Fowl with the disease can lower their egg production, become listless,
cough and wheeze. They pass it among themselves by sneezing, coughing or
other contact.
Other animals in the poultry barn -- rabbits, pigeons and cavies -- were
allowed to return home without a quarantine but with a recommendation they
be kept away from poultry.
Schmucker said although the disease is not uncommon among fowl, he could
not recall another instance in his 7 years with the department in which
birds were quarantined at a fair.

[Infectious laryngotracheitis is an acute, highly contagious herpes virus
infection of chickens and pheasants characterized by severe dyspnea
(difficulty breathing), and coughing.
In the acute form, gasping, coughing, rattling in the air sacs and
extension of the neck during inspiration are seen 5-12 days after natural
exposure. Affected birds lose their appetite and become inactive, and the
productivity in a laying flock is greatly reduced.
The acute disease is characterized by the clinical signs and finding blood,
mucus, and yellow caseous exudate or a hollow caseous cast in the trachea.
Some relief from signs is obtained by keeping the birds quite, lowering the
dust level, and using mild expectorants, being careful that they do not
contaminate feed or water. Vaccination should be practiced in endemic areas
and on farms where a specific diagnosis is made. Immediate vaccination of
adults in the face of an outbreak shortens the course of the disease.
Vaccination is best done with modified strains of low virulence applied to
the conjunctiva (eye drop). Mass methods of vaccination such as spray or
drinking water administration are less consistent in their results. Broiler
flocks in some area where the disease is endemic must be vaccinated when
young, but this is unlikely to be effective if done at less than 4 weeks of
age. Some vaccine producers recommend revaccination when birds are to be
held to maturity. - Mod.TG]
