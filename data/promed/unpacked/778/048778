Equine Influenza in Israel
---------------------------
From a notification by Dr Hagai Yadin:
From the end of Dec 2001 until 10 Feb 2002, 26 serum samples from
clinically suspected horses were received at the Kimron Veterinary
Institute (KVI), Beit-Dagan. The samples were collected throughout the
southern part of Israel, from the Southern Arava to the Heffer valley
in central Israel. The sera were examined by the influenza laboratory
at KVI's Department of Avian Diseases, for the presence of antibodies
against 3 variants: H2, H3, and H7. Elevated H3 titers were found in
paired samples, while the N antigen was identified as N8. One isolate
of an H3 influenza virus was obtained from a nasal swab of a horse
from Cannot, mid-south Israel. It was concluded that this year's
outbreak in horses was caused by influenza A virus subtype 2 (H3N8).
The inactivated equine influenza virus, approved for use in Israel,
includes the subtypes 1 (H7N7) and 2 (H3N8). Reasonable protection is
expected to be conferred in vaccinated horses, provided the
vaccination protocol is followed.
