** cases with no evidence of neuroinvasion
*** cases for which insufficient clinical information was provided
**** total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET
by state and local health departments.
"Neuroinvasive disease" refers to severe disease cases, particularly
West Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.
"West Nile fever" refers to typically less severe cases that show no
evidence of neuroinvasion. West Nile fever is not currently on the
list of nationally notifiable diseases, and, therefore, it is
optional whether or not state health departments report these cases
to CDC. [Further explanations of neuroinvasive West Nile virus
disease and West Nile fever can be found on the CDC website at the
URL provided above].
"Other" includes persons with clinical manifestations other than WN
fever, WN encephalitis, or WN meningitis, such as acute flaccid paralysis.
"Unspecified" cases are those for which sufficient clinical
information was not provided.
"Total human cases reported to CDC: "These numbers reflect both mild
and severe human disease cases occurring since 1 Jan 2007, reported
to ArboNET by state and local health departments. ArboNET is the
national electronic surveillance system established by CDC to assist
states in tracking West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne viruses.
Information regarding 2007 virus/disease activity is posted when such
cases are reported to CDC.

2007 West Nile virus activity in the United States (through 24 Jul 2007)
-----------------------------------------------
Data are being collected from state and local health departments on a
weekly basis and are reported to the CDC ArboNET for the following 5
categories: wild birds, sentinel chicken flocks, human cases,
veterinary cases, and mosquito surveillance. Maps detailing
county-level wild birds, sentinel chicken flocks, human cases,
veterinary cases, and mosquito surveillance data are published each
week on the collaborative USGS (US Geological Survey)/CDC West Nile
virus website.
As of 24 Jul 2007, human, avian, animal, or mosquito West Nile virus
(WNV) infections have been reported to CDC ArboNET from the following
states: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado,
Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,
Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska,
Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio,
Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah,
Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.
WNV antibody-positive sentinel animals (birds and/or horses) have
been found in Arizona, California, Florida, and Utah. [Note: not all
states have WNV sentinel programs. - Mods.JW/TY]
WNV equine infections have been reported from Arizona, California,
Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Dakota, Tennessee,
Texas, and Virginia.
WNV has been detected in dead wild birds in Arkansas, California,
Colorado, Delaware, Idaho, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, New
York, North Dakota, Oregon, Tennessee, and Texas.
WNV has been detected in mosquito pools collected in Arizona,
California, Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana,

The 1st animal case of West Nile Virus in San Mateo County this year
[2007] has been found in a squirrel collected last week in the city
of San Mateo, a San Mateo County Health Department spokeswoman
confirmed Wednesday [18 Jul 2007].
An eastern grey tree squirrel [_Sciurus carolinensis_] was found 9
Jul 2007 by the San Mateo County Mosquito Abatement District, and
subsequent testing at the University of California, Davis concluded
it tested positive for the virus, according to spokeswoman Beverly Thames.
No human cases have been reported in San Mateo County.
Garza said that after birds, tree squirrels run the highest risk of
West Nile Virus infection, but there is no evidence it can be
transmitted to humans through proximity to squirrels, he said.

ProMED Rapporteur Joseph P.Dudley
[Tree squirrels have been shown to be naturally infected with WN
virus in 12 states, including California. They have been shown to
develop encephalitis and viremias that are comparable to some bird
species that are WN virus amplifiers and are sufficient to infect
mosquito vectors. Interestingly, WN virus has been recovered from
oral swabs, suggesting that direct transmission might occur.

[Other reported instances of WN virus detection not included in the
CDC sites above: a magpie (_Pica hudsonia_) in Fallon, Churchill
County, Nevada.
WN virus transmission to sentinel chickens was reported in the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (see the 14 Jun 2007 WN virus update,
