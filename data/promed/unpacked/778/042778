Wisconsin: 3 suspected cases of human-to-human transmission of monkeypox
---------------------------------------------------------
So far the US outbreak of monkeypox has involved people who got infected
from pets. Now National Public Radio (NPR) has learned that Wisconsin
officials are investigating at least 3 possible cases of human-to-human
infection. If confirmed, experts say the cases will pose new challenges for
public health.
From experience in Africa, where monkeypox sometimes causes epidemics,
experts in infectious disease already knew that monkeypox can be transmitted
from one person to another. But they hoped it would be mainly an animal-to-
human disease in this country. Yesterday there were signs they may be
disappointed. Dr. John Melski of Wisconsin's Marshfield Clinic says the very
first American case of monkeypox -- a 4-year-old child -- may have infected
one of her caregivers. "A medical assistant at the Mansfield Clinic who acts
very much like a nurse had contact with the index case, the young child, long
before we knew what disease she had. But she did have direct contact and did
hold the child on 22 May 2003. 19 days later -- this Tuesday -- the medical
assistant developed chills, sweats and fatigue. The next day, one of her
close contacts got sick too. Her boyfriend on the 11 Jun 2003 had some
generalized aches and pains and experienced shaking chills with sweats. And
he has approximately 6 skin lesions." Neither case has been confirmed yet as
monkeypox.
Meanwhile, a nurse in Milwaukee came down with flu-like symptoms and a rash
after caring for a pet distributor with suspected monkeypox.
The cases are under investigation by state and federal health authorities.
Dr. David Daigle, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), said that: "We know that human-to-human spread can occur.
But it's not the most efficient method of transmission. Monkeypox can be
spread by direct contact with body fluids, an infected person, or virus
contaminated objects such as beds or clothing." Dr. Daigle stated that the
CDC had already warned health care workers to treat suspected monkeypox cases
as though they were dangerously infectious. But the Milwaukee nurse
reportedly wore a mask, gloves and gown when she treated the pet dealer.
Melski says he and his colleagues are debating whether they should get
smallpox vaccine to reduce their risk of monkeypox. The CDC has advised
vaccination for health care workers who have "unprotected contact" with
possible cases. Melski said that: "We need to know the details of what
exactly unprotected contact means. Does it mean you breathed the same air
that the patient breathed? How close? Same hall? Same room? Or does it mean
contact with body fluids -- which to the best of my knowledge makes the most
sense from what we know so far. But obviously no one knows all of the
answers."

circumstantial and confirmation of its reality must await the outcome of

Comments and Questions
----------------------
I followed with great interest the ProMED-mail posts on the outbreak of
monkeypox in the Midwest. I am concerned with both the human and North
American wildlife potential of this virus. After reading the posts I have
the following comments and questions about the information presented, and
would greatly appreciate it if someone currently close to these cases could
address them.
1. Has it been determined that the Gambian giant rat ("which apparently
carried the virus") had monkeypox, or was it assumed to be the source because
of its African origin? If it is not determined to be the source, perhaps the
virus came from somewhere else along the prairie dog "pipeline" to the
distributor/pet owner.
2. Were the carcasses of the prairie dogs that the distributor
voluntarily "put to death" disposed of in a way that would make the virus non-
infectious to any rodents that might investigate or consume those carcasses?
3. Poxviruses in general are very persistent in the environment. Were the
cages, toys, bedding, or whatever the infected prairie dogs came in contact
with, decontaminated? If not, these contaminated items could be a source of
monkeypox virus infection in the future. This applies to any of these
possibly contaminated items on the premises of the distributor or in the pet
owner's homes.

[As far as I am aware it has not been confirmed that a sick Gambian rat was
the origin of the outbreak, although this is very likely as these animals are
known to carry the virus, often without overt signs of disease. Nor can I
answer Dr. Docherty's other questions. Whatever the origin of the infection,
it is clear that North American rodents (ground squirrels at least) are
susceptible to the virus, and there is a risk that the virus could become
established in wildlife in the USA if there was any lapse in disease control.
Informed answers to Dr. Docherty's questions would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
