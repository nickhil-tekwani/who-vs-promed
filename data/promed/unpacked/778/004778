The plague appears to be spreading in Albuquerque's east mountains [in New Mexico].

According to the Department of Game and Fish, the latest plague infection was of a mountain lion and coati at the Wildlife West Nature Park (http://www.wildlifewest.org/).

A coati is a small raccoon-like animal; both it and the cougar died.

The plague is a bacterial disease of rodents which can be transmitted to humans through bites of infected fleas and contact with infected animals.

Indications of the disease are flu-like symptoms.

The Department of Game and Fish is applying insecticides in rodent burrows to kill fleas and posting signs to warn people to stay on designated trails.

Plague is usually more prevalent in mountain areas, so keep an eye on your pets.

[Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Some species are particularly susceptible. For example, _Y. pestis_ caused the extinction of entire colonies of black-tailed prairie dogs. Small rodents such as deer mice and grasshopper mice are suggested to act as the reservoirs. Larger species like squirrels and chipmunks are considered to be more vulnerable to infection.
