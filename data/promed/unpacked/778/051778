From: Karim Hechemy <Hechemy@wadsworth.org>

The presence of _Rickettsia mongolotimonae_ in a second patient in France
appears to confirm the presence of this rickettsia in France. All
sequences from the organism isolated from biopsies from the eschar shared
100% similarity with _R. mongolotimonae_ when compared with GenBank data.
It is not surprising in this age that the discovery of eight new
rickettsioses was made in the last thirteen years. Due to advances in
genetics more and more new species or strains of a species are going to be
discovered. These findings are of great epidemiologic interest. It shows
that a given spotted fever rickettsia is not localized to a specific
geographic region. Recognizing the syndrome by the clinical community is a
major issue since it was pointed out that the "symptoms differed markedly
from those of the first". These differences in clinical symptoms make the
clinical diagnosis of rickettsiosis even more difficult then it already is.
As a result, physicians should rule out rickettsiosis by laboratory means
in all patients with fever of unknown origin that do not present with the
"classical" symptoms in areas known to be endemic.
