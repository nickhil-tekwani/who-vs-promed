Health officials have identified another case in a serious outbreak of meningitis affecting gay and bisexual men in the Chicago [Illinois] area. Chicago Department of Public Health commissioner Julie Morita says a 7th case was identified over the weekend [4-5 Jul 2015]. It is the 6th case in Chicago and the 7th in Illinois. One person has died. Another person remains hospitalized and 2 are confined to rehabilitation facilities. Morita says that shows how serious the infection can be.

Morita held a meeting on Thursday morning [9 Jul 2015] with Chicago aldermen to enlist their support.

The majority of individuals who have been identified as having meningitis have been African-American men.

The city's health department has distributed 11 000 vaccines to pharmacies and other providers. The department has given more than 5100 vaccines to residents directly.

In early June 2015, an outbreak of invasive meningococcal disease (also referred to as "meningitis") was identified among men who have sex with men (MSM). Invasive meningococcal disease [IMD] can refer to any illness caused by the bacteria, _Neisseria meningitidis_. This includes bloodstream infections and meningitis, when the bacteria enter the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord.

Initially, the Chicago Department of Public Health [CDPH] made vaccine recommendations for a subgroup of MSM to prevent IMD. However, cases continue to occur. As of 18 Jun 2015, CDPH is broadening our vaccination recommendation to include all MSM.

[Although we are not told the microbial etiology of meningitis in men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Chicago, Illinois, area in the 1st news report above, I assume this meningitis outbreak is due to _Neisseria meningitidis_, as mentioned in the 2nd news report above.

The following was extracted from my moderator comments in ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - France: (Paris) serogroup C, MSM, vaccination 20150124.3116307:

Outbreaks of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) have occurred among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Germany, Belgium and France caused by a _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C strain with a certain genotype (http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/rapid-risk-assessment-invasive-meningococcal-disease-among-MSM.pdf). Similar outbreaks among MSM caused by _N. meningitidis_ serogroup C have occurred in Canada and the US (see prior ProMED-mail posts).

Molecular epidemiology has revealed that most cases of IMD are caused by only a few hypervirulent clonal lineages, whereas the genetic diversity is higher in meningococci recovered from healthy carriers (Claus H, Weinand H, Frosch M, Vogel U. Identification of the hypervirulent lineages of _Neisseria meningitidis_, the ST-8 and ST-11 complexes, by using monoclonal antibodies specific to NmeDI. J Clin Microbiol. 2003; 41(8): 3873-6; available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC179822/).

However, less virulent strains have been reported to cause IMD in immunocompromised HIV-infected patients (Ferreira de Andrade C, Cotrim da Cunha D, Cavalcanti V, de Filippis I. Fatal meningococcal meningitis in a HIV-infected patient caused by serogroup C _Neisseria meningitidis_ belonging to the non-hypervirulent clonal complex ST-60 (cc60). Braz J Infect Dis. 2011; 15(2): 178-80; available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1413-86702011000200017).

Severely immunosuppressed patients with HIV infection and a low CD4 cell count of less than or equal to 200/mm3 are likely to be at greater risk of developing bacterial meningitis (Domingo P, Suarez-Lozano I, Torres F, et al. Bacterial meningitis in HIV-1-infected patients in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 2009; 51(5): 582-7; available at http://www.researchgate.net/publication/26279285).

Mass vaccination campaigns have been used to control outbreaks of IMD in MSM ("See Also" below). The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has released recommendations for the use of meningococcal vaccines to control outbreaks of serogroup C meningococcal disease (CDC. Control and prevention of serogroup C meningococcal disease: evaluation and management of suspected outbreaks: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). MMWR Recomm Rep. 1997; 46(RR-5): 13-21; available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm).

More information on the HIV status of the cases of IMD, and the serogroup and genotype of the meningococcal isolates in the Chicago outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
