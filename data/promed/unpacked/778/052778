Canada: fatal case of bat-bite rabies in Alberta
------------------------------------------------
A 73 year old man from Northern Alberta, Canada is in intensive care in a
ketamine coma with a diagnosis of rabies confirmed by nuchal biopsy DFA on
1 Mar 2007. He was bitten by a bat in his home in August 2006 and developed
severe left shoulder pain (the site of the bite) in January [2007].
Subsequently, he complained of weakness, "difficulty swallowing" (possible
hydrophobia), rigidity (opisthotonic posturing), and was admitted to a
local hospital with a diagnosis of pneumonia (possibly due to secretion
retention, and phobic inspiratory spasms).
Rabies was suspected 3 days after he was transferred to our intensive care
unit. MRI was unremarkable, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) initially showed
slightly elevated protein with WBC 4. The patient did not seek medical
attention after the witnessed bat bite, and although he killed the bat, it
was not submitted for rabies testing. He and his family were unaware of the
risk.
This is the 3rd rabies case in Canada since 2000, highlighting the
importance of bats in the relatively rare North American rabies cases and
the need for continued public health vigilance so exposed persons and
health care providers are aware of the potential for disease and need for
rabies prophylaxis.

[ProMED-mail thanks Drs Saxinger and Johnstone for submitting this report.
We hope that the information will raise awareness of the role of bats in
the transmission of rabies in North America.
A description of "Antigenic and genetic divergence of rabies viruses from
bat species indigenous to Canada," by SA Nadin-Davis et al, can be found in
Virus Research 2001 Apr; 74(1-2): 139-56. These authors identified 4
principal phylogenetic groups (I-IV), sub-groups of which circulated in
particular bat species. Among the North American bat viruses, there was a
notable division between group I specimens associated with colonial,
non-migratory bats (_Myotis_ sp. and _Eptesicus fuscus_) and those of group
II harbored by solitary, migratory species (_Lasiurus_ sp. and
_Lasionycteris noctivagans_). Certain species of _Myotis_ were clearly
identified as rabies reservoirs, an observation often obscured previously
by their frequent infection by viral variants of other _Chiroptera_. An
additional group (III) apparently circulates in _E. fuscus_, while viruses
harbored by both insectivorous and hematophagus bats of Latin America
clustered to a separate clade (group IV). Comparison of the predicted N and
G proteins of these viruses with those of strains of terrestrial mammals
indicated a similarity in structural organization regardless of host
species lifestyle. These sequences permitted examination of the
evolutionary relationship of American bat rabies viruses within the
_Lyssavirus_ genus.
A more recent comprehensive survey of "Bats: important reservoir hosts of
emerging viruses," by CH Calisher et al, can be found in Clin Microbiol Rev
2006 Jul; 19(3): 531-45. This review summarizes information regarding
chiropteran characteristics and information regarding 66 viruses that have
been isolated from bats. - Mod.CP]
