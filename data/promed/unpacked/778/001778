The number of cases and the geographical spread of hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome (HPS) has increased in the Americas since the syndrome was first
identified in 1993 in the USA and has now been reported in Argentina,
Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay in addition to
the USA. Facing the possibility of further spread of HPS, the ministers of
health of all countries in the Americas joined in a resolution to intensify
the surveillance of, and fight against, hantavirus infection during the
Directing Council of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) in
September 1997.
A total of 350-400 HPS cases have been confirmed in the Americas, most of
them in Argentina and the USA. About 45% of the reported cases were fatal.
The high fatality rate is associated with the sudden onset of pulmonary
oedema and respiratory distress. There is no specific treatment for HPS,
although prompt diagnosis is important for appropriate management of
respiratory distress. HPS is caused by several distinct hantaviruses which
are each associated with a specific rodent host. Once infected, rodents
shed the virus throughout their lifetime. Humans are infected by inhaling
aerosols of fresh or dried rodent
excreta (faeces, urine and saliva). Investigation of an epidemic in
Argentina in 1995 provided strong evidence for person-to-person
transmission, not observed in studies in the USA. In any event, strict
barrier nursing techniques are now recommended for management of suspected
or confirmed cases.
Control measures in endemic areas focus on rodent control with particular
emphasis on excluding rodents from buildings and reducing suitable habitats
around inhabited dwellings. Many infections have resulted from cleaning
rodent-infested areas. The use of readily available disinfectants such as
chlorine bleach is recommended to decontaminate potentially infectious
droppings and debris prior to cleaning. If available, respiratory
protection should be used during this high risk activity. Improved
laboratory diagnostic capacity in
endemic areas is important for prompt recognition of HPS cases.
Furthermore, identification of the rodent reservoir of each hantavirus is
important to detect potential HPS endemic regions and to understand the
risk of rodent-human interaction.
