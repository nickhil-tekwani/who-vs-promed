[As noted in the OIE WAHID report, both H5 and H7, low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) outbreaks in poultry are considered to be a reportable disease for OIE because it is critical to monitor LPAI circulation and ensure that it doesn't manifest in the future as an HPAI problem.

The Netherlands has had problems with H7 highly pathogenic avian influenza strains both in poultry and in humans, usually causing conjunctivitis in humans and high mortality in poultry, but there was one case of an H7N7 killing a 57-year-old veterinarian in 2003.

Low pathogenic H5N2 have been identified previously and are relatively common. They do bear watching however because they can become highly pathogenic in poultry environments like those found in the Netherlands. - Mod.PC]
