Cattle disease discovered in Terengganu
-----------------------------------------------
The highly contagious cattle disease, "haemorrhagic septicaemia" has been
discovered in the state following the death of 4 buffaloes in Kampung Bukit
Tumbuh on 4 Dec 1999.
Terengganu Veterinary Services director Dr Ibrahim Che Embong said blood
samples from the dead cattle were sent to the veterinary laboratory in Kota
Baharu. Tests on the samples confirmed that the buffaloes were infected by
the disease. "The test results showed that the disease has recur[red] in
Terengganu and the department is taking steps to control it," he said when
contacted.
The last reported case of haemorrhagic septicaemia in Terengganu was in
1984.
Dr Ibrahim said the disease could have been spread through contact with
cattle brought into the state without the department's knowledge. He said
veterinary staff had been despatched to the village yesterday to vaccinate
the livestock there.

[Terengganu is on the northern Malaysian coast. Its northernmost border is
only some 60kms from Thailand (with Kota Baharu in between on the coastal
highway). Inland to the west is Kelantan and to the south-west Pahang. To
quote Blood & Henderson "The disease occurs chiefly in areas where
veterinary assistance is not readily available." To quote further ... "where
it causes very heavy death losses, particularly in low lying areas, and when
the animals are exposed to wet, chilly weather or exhausted by heavy work."
Note that these were buffalo, which are exposed frequently to heavy
work demands. The reality of the source of this outbreak must await further
information from Malaysia and possibly southern Thailand. The present
vaccine is very effective, if used. - MHJ]
