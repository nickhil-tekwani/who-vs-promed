The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is voluntarily closing the Bruneau Wild Horse Off-Range Corrals (ORC), in Idaho, to horses entering or leaving the facility due to a strangles outbreak, the agency announced 19 Jul 2018.

Individual infected animals are being tested to confirm the diagnosis, but the horses have developed clinical signs indicative of strangles.

Caused by the bacteria called _Streptococcus equi_, strangles causes respiratory problems, nasal discharge, and large pus-filled abscesses in horses' throats and necks, among other issues. Although horses usually recover, this disease is highly contagious, spreads from direct or indirect contact between horses, and can lead to more serious complications in some horses. It also can cause persistent infections in populations of asymptomatic carrier horses.

The closure could delay the shipment of the wild horses gathered from 3 Wyoming herd management areas -- Adobe Town, Salt Wells Creek, and Great Divide Basin -- to BLM facilities and events nationwide to be placed into private care.

"The Bruneau ORC horses will be monitored closely by facility staff and an on-call veterinarian," said Krystle Wengreen, Bruneau ORC manager. "After all signs of infection have passed, the closure will be lifted and horses may be transported out of the facility to event locations. The BLM takes the health of every wild horse seriously."

For more information, contact the Bruneau ORC at (208) 329-4534.

[This disease spreads very rapidly. We applaud the BLM for taking the health of the horses, these as well as those they may come into contact with, seriously.

_Streptococcus equi equi_ is highly contagious and produces high morbidity and low mortality in susceptible populations. Transmission occurs via fomites and direct contact with infectious exudates. Carrier animals are important for maintenance of the bacteria between epizootics and initiation of outbreaks on premises previously free of disease. Survival of the organism in the environment is dependent on temperature and humidity; it is susceptible to desiccation, extreme heat, and exposure to sunlight, and must be protected within mucoid secretions to survive. Under ideal environmental circumstances, the organism can survive 7-9 weeks outside the host. Paddocks and barn facilities used by infected horses should be regarded as contaminated for about 2 months after resolution of an outbreak.

The incubation period of strangles is 3-14 days and the 1st sign of infection is fever (103-106 deg F/39.4-41.1 deg C). Within 24-48 hours of the initial fever spike, the horse will exhibit signs typical of strangles, including mucoid to mucopurulent nasal discharge, depression, and submandibular lymphadenopathy.
