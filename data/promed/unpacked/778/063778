Researchers at Michigan State University say at least 2 cases of a newly identified dog virus have shown up in Michigan.

The university's Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health said it found canine circovirus in samples from 2 dogs submitted by veterinary clinics. But acting director Thomas Mullaney said both animals were infected with other organisms, so it's uncertain whether the virus caused their sicknesses.

"Currently, circovirus by itself is not associated with a specific disease process," he said. But it has been shown to cause disease when combined with other viruses or bacteria in other species, including pigs.

Veterinarians at a clinic in Ann Arbor say they've treated a number of dogs that died after exhibiting signs of the virus, including vomiting, lethargy and diarrhea.

"They're coming in here and they're dying very quickly," Dr. Lindsay Ruland told WWJ Newsradio 950's Kathryn Larson.

But the university center said the reports are no reason for dog owners to panic. It said veterinarians should look for circovirus in animals only after ruling out more common causes of the same signs.

*****Canine circovirus was 1st reported in 2012. Infections have been reported in California. The American Veterinary Medical Association says the virus initially was suspected of killing several dogs in Ohio in August and September [2013], but is no longer being considered as the primary cause of their deaths.*****

Experts don't know how dogs are being infected, although the highest risk of spreading viruses comes through contact with an infected animal.

Ruland said the flu-like signs can progress rapidly. She urged concerned pet owners to monitor their animals, and not to hesitate to take them to an urgent care clinic or to the vet if symptoms develop.

[There is not enough known about this virus in dogs. The clinical signs are flu-like, including vomiting and diarrhea. Differential diagnosis may include parvovirus. The virus in pigs produces similar clinical signs and also causes rapid death.

Hopefully our knowledge of this virus will progress. Is it a primary killer? Or is it a secondary invader to an animal whose immune system is already weakened for some reason? More information is clearly needed regarding this virus. In a previous post, it was suggested with only weak anecdotal evidence that the virus may be a zoonotic virus.
