Six more cases have been confirmed in Uganda's Ebola Sudan outbreak, raising the total to 7, the World Health Organization (WHO) said today [22 Sep 2022] in an update, while noting that the outbreak location -- Mubende district -- poses a risk of further spread and that health officials are weighing the possibility of testing a vaccine targeting the strain in the location.

On Twitter today [22 Sep 2022], WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said 16 people with suspected infections are in medical care. The number of deaths in confirmed people remains at 1. The outbreak was first announced 2 days ago, marking Uganda's 1st outbreak involving the strain since 2012.

In its statement, the WHO said medical teams are monitoring 43 contacts. At a separate WHO African regional office briefing today [22 Sep 2022], Kyobe Henry Bbosa, MD, Ebola incident commander with Uganda's health ministry, said that, along with continuous contact tracing, officials are repurposing COVID treatment centers and enhancing public awareness about the disease.

In its statement, the WHO said it is concerned about the outbreak's location. Mubende is a 2-hour drive from Kampala and is on a busy road that leads to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The area has gold mines that attract people from elsewhere in Uganda and from other countries [see below]. "The mobile nature of the population in Mubende increases the risk of a possible spread of the virus," the WHO said.

Along with WHO expert support, the agency has provided Uganda 6 viral hemorrhagic fever kits, and one has been delivered to the outbreak area. It added that although there aren't any treatments that target infections involving the Ebola Sudan strain, early identification and supportive treatment can greatly increase the chance of survival.

At the WHO briefing, Patrick Otim, MBChB, MPH, a health officer with the WHO regional office, said Ebola Sudan infections are slightly less severe than those involving Ebola Zaire, with a case-fatality rate for the former ranging from 40% to 100% without treatment. "It's very critical that we treat this outbreak as serious," he said.

Current evidence suggests that Merck's VSV-EBOV vaccine, used in ring vaccination campaigns in Ebola Zaire outbreaks, doesn't provide cross-protection against Ebola Sudan infection, the WHO said. So far, there are 6 vaccine candidates against Ebola Sudan infections in early stages of development, 3 of which have phase 1 safety data. A WHO research team is in contact with developers to determine if any could be evaluated in the current outbreak setting.

VSV-EBOV was studied in the West Africa outbreak setting while it was in development. After trials found that it was highly effective, health officials have routinely used it in ring vaccination response activities, including outbreaks in recent years in the DRC. Drug regulators in a number of countries have approved the vaccine.

[2] World Health Organization (WHO) statement

In an accelerated effort to scale up response to the Ebola disease outbreak in Uganda, the World Health Organization (WHO) is delivering medical supplies, providing logistics and deploying staff to support the national authorities in halting the spread of the virus.

WHO has deployed a technical team to Mubende district to support surveillance, infection prevention and control, and the management of cases. The organization is also assisting in the activation of surveillance structures in neighbouring districts and is repurposing its country-based staff to bolster the response. In addition, 5 international experts will be deployed, with numbers increasing if needed.

"We are acting quickly and decisively to draw the reins on this outbreak. Our experts are already on the ground working with Uganda's experienced Ebola control teams to reinforce surveillance, diagnosis, treatment and preventive measures," said Dr Abdou Salam Gueye, Regional Emergency Director with the WHO Regional Office for Africa. "Africa's stronger homegrown emergency readiness is proving ever more crucial in tackling outbreaks such as Ebola."

Due to Uganda's previous outbreaks and the threat of importation of cases from neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo that has fought several outbreaks, WHO and the Ministry of Health have collaborated on many preparedness activities, the last such exercise was in August 2022, where 9 Ugandan clinicians were trained on how to manage viral haemorrhagic fevers and are now working in the response.

The WHO Research and Development Blueprint team is in contact with all [vaccine] developers and is leading a collaborative effort involving international experts to determine which vaccine(s) may be suitable for additional evaluation during this outbreak (and if doses with required standards are available) should more cases be confirmed. A CORE protocol for their evaluation exists, and WHO will discuss the proposed next steps with the Ugandan authorities to seek their approval.

[3] Case count

Uganda has confirmed 7 cases of Ebola including in a man who died this week, and 7 other deaths are being investigated as suspected cases of a strain for which the authorities do not yet have a vaccine, officials said on Thursday [22 Sep 2022].

The 24-year-old man who died had developed a high fever, diarrhoea and abdominal pains, and was vomiting blood. After initially being treated for malaria, he was diagnosed as having contracted the Sudan strain of the Ebola virus.

"As of today [22 Sep 2022], we have 7 confirmed cases, of whom we have one confirmed death," Kyobe Henry Bbosa, Ebola incident commander at the Ugandan Ministry of Health, told a briefing. "But also we have 7 probable cases that died before the confirmation of the outbreak."

Bbosa said their investigations had not yet pinned down the index case or "patient zero" but said the outbreak appeared to have started around the beginning of September [2022] "when people started dying" in a small village in Mubende district in central Uganda.

Uganda last reported an outbreak of the Ebola Sudan strain in 2012. The strain is less transmissible than Ebola Zaire, Patrick Otim, health emergency officer at the World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa said at the briefing, adding that it had a lower fatality rate in previous outbreaks.

However, Otim said the Sudan strain posed a greater threat because the world did not yet have a vaccine for it like it has with the Zaire strain. "So it's very, very critical that at this point we treat this outbreak as serious because we may not have the advantage that we have gained in terms of advancement in medical countermeasures," he said.

Mubende lies on a highway that starts from the capital Kampala, connecting Uganda to Democratic Republic of Congo, and Otim said this meant there was a threat of cross-border transmission. In 2019, Uganda experienced an outbreak of Ebola Zaire. The virus was imported from neighbouring Congo, which was battling a large epidemic in its northeastern region.

[The thought that the outbreak likely began in early September (2022) is concerning because it was not recognized until it was confirmed in the 24-year-old man on 20 Sep 2022. There have likely been many exposures to the virus because Mubende district is a busy hub. Uganda seems well prepared to contain the outbreak, although a vaccine and antivirals effective against the Sudan strain would be most efficient. Uganda and WHO have acted very quickly, which experience has demonstrated to be extremely important in controlling virus spread. - Mod.LK
