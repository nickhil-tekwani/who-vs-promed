Three residents in Tabango, Leyte have died due to food poisoning after eating puffer fish, locally known as "butete". The victims are residents of Sitio Patay, Brgy. Tabing, Tabango, according to a report from the Tabango Municipal Police Station. Four other individuals they ate with were also hospitalized with food poisoning.

Initial police investigation showed one of those who died cooked puffer fish on Monday [28 Dec 2020] and offered it for free to customers of his barbeque stand business. They reportedly ate the liver and experienced extreme vomiting and loss of consciousness. They were brought to the Tabango District Hospital but were pronounced dead on arrival.

Meanwhile, the 4 other hospitalized victims also suffered symptoms. One of them has already recovered and is now home, while 3 are still in the hospital but are in a stable condition.

The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources has warned that several puffer fish species contain a highly lethal neurotoxin called "tetrodotoxin". Ingestion of this substance "can rapidly cause malaise, dizziness, and tingling about the mouth, which may be followed by ataxia, convulsions, respiratory paralysis, and death."

The bureau said the toxin is usually found in the internal organs of the fish. The ovary and liver are most dangerous, but other parts are also toxic in many puffer fish species, while some have toxin even in skin, blood and bones, it added.

[In summary, 3 people are dead, 3 remain hospitalized, and one person has recovered enough to be discharged from the hospital.

It is important to know that the distribution of toxin varies quite widely, based on the species of pufferfish. This article does not tell us the specific species of pufferfish involved.

The following comment is from: CDC. Tetrodotoxin poisoning outbreak from imported dried puffer fish -- Minneapolis, Minnesota, 2014. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2013; 63(51): 1222-5; the full report and references are available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6351a2.htm?s_cid=mm6351a2_w.

"The pufferfish (sometimes called globefish, fugu, or blowfish) is highly prized in many Asian cultures and is consumed safely in some countries for example, Japan). Consumption is safe, however, only with specialized training regarding which species to prepare and how to prepare them, because the concentration and tissue distribution of toxin varies greatly among the more than 180 known species. Regulatory authorities in the USA do not provide this training, nor is tetrodotoxin testing routinely conducted; therefore, only the frozen meat, skin, and male gonad from one species of pufferfish (_Takifugu rubripes_) from Japan, processed according to Japanese safety guidelines, is permitted to be imported into the USA a limited number of times per year, pursuant to an FDA/Japanese government agreement established in 1988 (6). All other imported pufferfish products are prohibited (7). For domestic sources of pufferfish, only nontoxic species are recommended by FDA for consumption. FDA regulates domestically sourced pufferfish through the Seafood Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points regulation (5). Selected states have established additional requirements for controls for pufferfish from certain areas because of potential toxicity (8).

"_Lagocephalus lunaris_ is an Indo-Pacific species of pufferfish and is one of the only species known to contain high concentrations of tetrodotoxin naturally in the meat, making safe preparation of this product impossible (9). In its native region, it has been confused with similar looking, nontoxic species, resulting in numerous illnesses (10). This is the same species that was illegally imported and responsible for illnesses in California, Illinois, and New Jersey in 2007 (4).

... "Medical professionals who work in EDs or with persons from countries with a tradition of pufferfish consumption should be aware of this potential public health threat and collaborate with local poison centers and health departments to investigate any outbreaks of tetrodotoxin poisoning to determine the source of the product and block additional sales to prevent additional illnesses. FDA recently released materials, including instructions for the collection and submission of meal remnants, for several fish-related illnesses, including puffer fish poisoning."

The following was extracted from the US FDA Bad Bug Book
https://www.fda.gov/media/83271/download, previously known as the bad bug book:
"Fish poisoning by consumption of members of the order Tetraodontiformes is one of the most violent intoxications from marine species. The gonads, liver, intestines, and skin of pufferfish can contain levels of tetrodotoxin sufficient to produce rapid and violent death. The flesh of many pufferfish may not usually be dangerously toxic.

"Tetrodotoxin has also been isolated from widely differing animal species, including the California newt, parrotfish, frogs of the genus _Atelopus_, the blue-ringed octopus, starfish, angelfish, and xanthid crabs.

... "The metabolic source of tetrodotoxin is uncertain. No algal source has been identified, and until recently tetrodotoxin was assumed to be a metabolic product of the host. However, recent reports of the production of tetrodotoxin/anhydrotetrodotoxin by several bacterial species, including strains of the family Vibrionaceae, _Pseudomonas_ spp, and _Photobacterium phosphoreum_, point toward a bacterial origin of this family of toxins..." [These are relatively common marine bacteria that are often associated with marine animals. If confirmed, these findings may have some significance in toxicoses that have been more directly related to these bacterial species. - Mod.TG]

"The 1st symptom of intoxication is a slight numbness of the lips and tongue, appearing between 20 minutes to 3 hours after eating poisonous pufferfish. The next symptom is increasing paresthesia [sensation of burning, numbness, tingling, itching, or prickling] in the face and extremities, which may be followed by sensations of lightness or floating. Headache, epigastric pain, nausea, diarrhea, and/or vomiting may occur. Occasionally, some reeling or difficulty in walking may occur. The 2nd stage of the intoxication is increasing paralysis. Many victims are unable to move; even sitting may be difficult. There is increasing respiratory distress. Speech is affected, and the victim usually exhibits dyspnea [shortness of breath], cyanosis [turns blue], and hypotension [drop in blood pressure]. Paralysis increases, and convulsions, mental impairment, and cardiac arrhythmia [alterations in heartbeat] may occur.

"The victim, although completely paralyzed, may be conscious and in some cases completely lucid until shortly before death. Death usually occurs within 4 to 6 hours, with a known range of about 20 minutes to 8 hours."
