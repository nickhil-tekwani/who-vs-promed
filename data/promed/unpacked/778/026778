A 14-year-old girl in the central province of Quang Ngai died on Thursday [17 Apr 2014] after being afflicted with a mysterious skin disease that has sickened hundreds and killed 26 people in the province since 2011. The girl was one of the 2 cases and the 1st death of the syndrome of dermatitis with a horny layer thickening in foot and hand to be recorded in Quang Ngai's Ba To District this year [2014], Viet Nam News Agency reported.

She was admitted to Ba To Health Center on [8 Apr 2014] with symptoms like thickened horny layers in her feet and hands and increased liver enzyme level. Her condition got worse, and she was transferred to Children Hospital 2 in Ho Chi Minh City on [14 Apr 2014] and succumbed 4 days later to failure of respiration and multiple organs. Local health agencies have arrived in Ba Nam Commune, where the girl lived, to conduct check-ups on people, and they have found 13 with increased liver enzyme levels so far, according to the news report.

Since it was 1st discovered in April 2011, the disease, which was believed to be the 1st reported in the world, has sickened 231 people in Ba To and Son Ha districts. It begins with blisters on the hands and feet and loss of appetite and can turn fatal due to organ failure, starting with the liver. The condition is thought to be caused by chronic poisoning, but the toxin responsible for it has yet to be identified, although a few factors have been suspected, like heavy metals in the soil and moldy rice. An effective method of treatment has not been established.

[A 28 Jun 2012 WHO report on this entity entitled "Media statement on Inflammatory Palmoplantar Hyperkeratosis (IPPH) syndrome in Ba To district, Quang Ngai Province" http://www.wpro.who.int/vietnam/mediacentre/releases/2012/MediastatementIPPH28June2012/en/ is reported as follows:

"The Ministry of Health of Viet Nam is actively providing intervention measures to treat people as well as prevent, investigate and monitor the development of new cases of inflammatory palmoplantar hyperkeratosis syndrome (IPPH) in Ba To district Quang Ngai province in Central Viet Nam. The Ministry of Health has been actively supported in its response to the situation in the affected area by other ministries and sectors, including the Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of National Defense and Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.

"IPPH syndrome is characterized by a chronic process that can lead to inflammation and lesions of the hands, feet and liver. People with IPPH syndrome have only been found in Ba To district in Quang Ngai province. People with IPPH syndrome were 1st reported on 19 Apr 2011 in Ba To district. By 28 Jun 2012, a total of 216 cases and 12 deaths had been reported in 5 communes (Ba Dien, Ba Ngac, Ba Xa, Ba Vinh and Ba To) in Ba To district. Currently, 18 people are being treated in health care facilities in or around Quang Ngai province.

"The Ministry of Health has conducted several field investigations focusing on epidemiology, clinical medicine, occupational health, nutrition, toxicology and environmental factors but has yet to find a cause. However, results from these extensive investigations indicate the following:

"To date, investigation suggests that IPPH syndrome may not be infectious in origin. Some people with IPPH ate rice from the previous harvest; many people with IPPH suffer from malnourishment; aflatoxins were present in a few rice samples; most people with IPPH had liver inflammation; no evidence of elevated levels of heavy metals or agrochemicals were found in human or environmental samples.

"In addition to on-going investigations to identify the cause, it is important that the comprehensive intervention measures in place to reduce mortality and the development of new cases as well as to improve the overall health status of the people living in Ba To district are followed," said Minister of Health, Dr. Nguyen Thi Kim Tien.

"To reduce mortality, the Ministry of Health has developed treatment guidelines, provided training for doctors, and sent consultants from central hospitals to directly guide and provide case management in Ba To district. The Ministry of Health has also put in place measures in the affected community for the prevention, treatment and diagnosis of illness. Preventive measures include: the provision of rice for people as well as advice on proper storage methods, distribution of vitamin and nutrient supplements to Ba To district residents, provision of environmental sanitation and vector control services for the households, treatment of community water supplies for people, and strengthened communication activities to promote personal hygiene and the seeking of healthcare as soon as symptoms develop.

"The WHO and the US CDC have been in close communication with Viet Nam's Ministry of Health for this response. In early June 2012, the Ministry of Health's General Department of Preventive Medicine invited 2 experts from WHO and US CDC to consult with the Ministry of Health's General Department of Preventive Medicine. They conferred with Viet Nam investigators of the outbreak, reviewed data collected to date, and made recommendations for additional studies and testing to guide interventions and direct further investigation.

"'We support the intervention measures implemented by Viet Nam's Ministry of Health in addressing the cases of IPPH syndrome in Quang Ngai province and believe that the Ministry of Health are on the right track. As we do not know what causes the syndrome, or its source of transmission, identifying the cause may take longer than anticipated or prove elusive,'" said Dr. Takeshi Kasai, WHO Representative in Viet Nam.

"The Ministry of Health will continue to focus its efforts in treating current IPPH syndrome patients and monitoring new cases as they occur. Further investigations will be conducted to measure and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions as well as to identify other risk factors associated with IPPH syndrome. WHO and US CDC will continue to provide technical support to the Ministry of Health, Viet Nam.

"The Ministry of Health recommends the following measures to prevent and control IPPH syndrome:

"For the residents of Ba To district: Consume rice provided by local health authorities; take the vitamin and nutritional supplements distributed by local health authorities; ensure good environmental sanitation and personal hygiene; Monitor for early detection of symptoms; and seek immediate care at the nearest health facility.

"For local authorities in Ba To district: Supervise and implement current intervention measures; continue to provide nutritional supplements and rice to residents of Ba To district; promote and encourage people to maintain environmental and personal hygiene, to consume nutritious foods, and to seek healthcare as soon as symptoms develop."

A case fatality rate of about 10 percent for this entity of unclear but probably not infectious etiology has been reported. Specifically, no evidence of a heavy metal intoxication has been reported.
