Customs alerted on banned meat items
------------------------------------
Enforcement agents of the Bureau of Customs will
be on alert for imported cattle and meat products
from Taiwan and Lebanon following the reported
outbreak of foot and mouth disease [FMD] in the 2 countries.

This was stressed by Intelligence and Enforcement
Group (IEG) acting chief Jairus Paguntalan who
said that it is part of the Bureaus standard
operating procedure to circularize any memorandum
from any government agency and issue their own
memorandum to alert their personnel, especially
if it concerns the health and safety of the Filipino consumers.

Customs Intelligence and Investigation Service
(CIIS) OIC [Officer in Charge] at the Port of
Manila Johnny Martinez said that even without the
ban, they are already very vigilant against the
entry of contaminated food products.

This is a year round activity, we are monitoring
all shipments but we are especially wary of the
entry of any poultry products contaminated by
bird flu and also, for meat -­ for those contaminated by FMD, he said.

In compliance to the ban order, Martinez said
that incoming meat shipments from the 2 countries
will immediately be placed on alert, until such
time clearance is granted by the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI).

The Department of Agriculture (DA) has ordered a
ban on the importation of cattle and other
animals after the World Animal Health
Organization (OIE) confirmed the outbreaks in Taiwan and Lebanon.

FMD was detected in a dairy cattle farm in the
province of Kamed El-Iouz in Lebanon while the
disease was discovered among swines in the
Maoliao township, Yun-Lin and Beidou town in Chang-hua, Taiwan.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Susan Baekeland

[The concern of the Philippine authorities may be
viewed in the context of the country's status as
"FMD-free without vaccination (Islands of
Mindanao, Visayas, Palawan and Masbate)". No
outbreaks of FMD have been recorded within the
entire country since December 2005.

Taiwan notified the OIE its new outbreak in swine
on 29 Mar 2009, reporting that the outbreak had
started on 27 Mar 2009. A previous, resolved
outbreak had occurred on 18 Feb 2009. Both
outbreaks involved non-vaccinated pigs which are
kept as sentinel animals on every farm, in line
with Taiwan's FMD prevention and control policy.
The current case involved few pigs of a batch of
50 pigs that origin from a farm where clinical
signs consistent with FMD were found during
pre-slaughter inspection. The local animal
disease control competent authority traced back
to the original farm. Samples were collected. The
[nonstructural protein] NSP ELISA test result
was, reportedly, positive. The result of RT-PCR
test was -- as of 29 Mar 2009 -- negative while
virus isolation and additional tests underway and
serotyping pending. Modified stamping out was applied.

In view of the apparent absence of disease in
vaccinated animals, it may be anticipated that
the serotype of the current virus will be found
as similar to the previous outbreak, namely serotype O.

The Lebanese outbreak is of different lucidity.
Lebanon submitted an immediate notification to
the OIE on 20 Feb 2009, concerning 11 outbreaks
in cattle, recorded in 11 villages of which 7
situated in the Al Biqa' province and 4 in Ash
Shamal province, totalling 137 cases out of 470
susceptible animals. The outbreak had,
reportedly, started a month earlier, namely on 19
Jan 2009. For a map showing the locations of the
11 outbreaks see
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=7809>.

The applied measures were
"Quarantine, Vaccination in response to the
outbreak (s), Disinfection of infected
premises/establishment(s), Treatment of affected
animals (Symptomatic treatment in all mild cases.
Only in one outbreak, where the clinical signs
were severe, the owner decided to slaughter all the animals)".

The notification included the following
epidemiological comments: "In the framework of
an official programme of the Ministry of
Agriculture, most of the dairy cattle in Lebanon
were vaccinated, free of charge, in 2008, using a
trivalent vaccine (O1, A 22, Asia 1) twice (in
spring and autumn 2008). Some cattle newly
illegally introduced into Lebanon and not
previously vaccinated or vaccinated using
different serotypes showed clinical signs. Some
private veterinarians in Lebanon use also
different serotypes in vaccination, which may be giving partial protection.
Samples taken from clinical cases shall be sent
soon to the OIE Reference Laboratory of Pirbright
[WRLFMD] for serotyping and matching test".

According to the WRLFMD web-site, the samples (7)
from Lebanon were received there on 24 Mar 2009.

Recent information (see 20090331.1242)
revealed that in January and February [2009],
more than 130 outbreaks of FMD, in central and
southern Iraq, involved a new variant of A Iran
05. The same strain of FMD type A was detected in
Bahrain, and then Kuwait, with those identified
in Kuwait almost identical to strains found in
Iraq in 2009. In February [2009], the same
strain, with close identity to those in
Iraq/Kuwait/Iran, was identified in samples
submitted by Libya to the WRLFMD at Pirbright.
This is alarming information; so far, this new
strain has not been identified in Lebanon nor in
its direct neighbours, Syria and Israel. FMDV
serotype A has not been reported in Lebanon since
1973, in Syria since 2002 and in Israel since 1981.

Results of the diagnostic tests concerning the 7
samples sent from Lebanon to Pirbright are anticipated the earliest.

The issue is, most probably, to be discussed next
week (7-8 April) in the 5th Round Table for the
surveillance and control of FMD in the Middle
East (see <http://www.rr-middleeast.oie.int/> OIE
Regional Representation for the Middle East). -Mod.AS].
