----------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is the pertinent section about canine Lyme disease on page 174 in my book "Lyme disease: Why it's spreading, how it makes you sick, and what to do about it" (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2015):

"Antibiotic therapy for companion animals
-----------------------------------------
The risk of _Borrelia burgdorferi_ infection for dogs exceeds the risk for people in a given geographic area. More than half the dogs may be antibody positive in some high-risk areas, while the antibody positive rate for human residents in the same area is around 10 percent {Berrada, 2009 #277}. But exposed dogs are much less likely to become sick than humans after infection {Littman, 2006 #246}. What disease occurs in dogs is mainly in puppies and in the form of arthritis leading to lameness several weeks after an infecting tick bite. There are reports of an uncommon but serious kidney disorder that is suspected to be caused by a combination of _B. burgdorferi_ infection itself and the immune response to it. The most commonly used diagnostic test for antibodies in dogs is an EIA [enzyme immunoassay] test with C6 peptide, which is similar to the human assay. A follow-up Western Blot is seldom performed, so there may be more false-positive test results for dogs.

For seropositive dogs with joint disease or the kidney disease, antibiotics are commonly prescribed. If _B. burgdorferi_ infection was the cause, the lameness tends to respond more quickly to the antibiotics than does the longer-standing kidney disorder. Although there have been studies of antibiotics in experimental infections of dogs, there still have not been any controlled clinical trials for naturally acquired infections in the community. Doxycycline once a day by mouth is the most common therapy. Unlike amoxicillin or ceftriaxone, this tetracycline antibiotic is also a suitable treatment of _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ (Chapter 11), another pathogen carried by deer ticks. Alternative oral antibiotics are the macrolide azithromycin or the penicillin amoxicillin. If an intravenous antibiotic is required, ceftriaxone is the primary option.

Should healthy dogs be screened for the _B. burgdorferi_ antibodies? There is controversy about this, with most of the arguments against this practice {Littman, 2006 #246}. A prospective study of at-risk, outdoor Bernese Mountain dogs in Switzerland looked at seropositive animals that showed no signs of illness at the time of the blood draw {Gerber, 2009 #253}. When they were examined 2 to 3 years later, they were still free of lameness or kidney disease. So, as for humans, the seropositive state in the absence of illness or organ dysfunction is not, by itself, an indication for treatment.

Cats may be at as great a risk of _B. burgdorferi_ infection as dogs in areas with Lyme disease {Berrada, 2009 #277}. But, in comparison to dogs, there is much less information on either experimental or natural infections in cats. If Lyme disease is suspected in a cat, the usual antibiotic for treatment is doxycycline."

I can provide the cited references if need be. This is a particularly pertinent one, because it is a consensus statement:

Abstract
--------
The purpose of this report is to offer a consensus opinion of ACVIM [American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine] diplomates on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of _Borrelia burgdorferi_ infections in dogs (canine Lyme disease). Clinical syndromes known to commonly be associated with canine Lyme disease include polyarthritis and glomerulopathy. Serological test results can be used to document exposure to _B. burgdorferi_ but not prove illness. Although serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay/indirect fluorescent antibody assay titers can stay positive for months to years after treatment, quantitative C6 peptide antibody paired tests need more study. Serological screening of healthy dogs is controversial because it can lead to overdiagnosis or overtreatment of normal dogs, most of which never develop Lyme disease. However, serological screening can provide seroprevalence and sentinel data and stimulate owner education about tick infections and control. Although it is unknown whether treatment of seropositive healthy dogs is beneficial, the consensus is that seropositive dogs should be evaluated for proteinuria and other coinfections and tick control prescribed. Tick control can include a product that repels or protects against tick attachment, thereby helping to prevent transmission of coinfections as well as Borrelia spp. Seropositive dogs with clinical abnormalities thought to arise from Lyme disease generally are treated with doxycycline (10 mg/kg q24h for 1 month). Proteinuric dogs might need longer treatment as well as medications and diets for protein-losing nephropathy. The ACVIM diplomates believe the use of Lyme vaccines still is controversial and most do not administer them. It is the consensus opinion that additional research is needed to study predictors of illness, "Lyme nephropathy," and coinfections in Lyme endemic areas.
