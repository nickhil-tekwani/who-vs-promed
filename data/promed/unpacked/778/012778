The state Secretariat of Health has recorded a total of 21 692 dengue cases
up to this past Tuesday (8 [Jun 2010]). During this period there were 789
reported serious dengue cases (dengue with complications and DHF),
including 7 [dengue] confirmed deaths and 8 under investigation.

The ranking of the municipalities with the greatest [dengue] incidence are
Guacui (8221/per 100 000 population), Colatina (3249/100 000), Ibatiba
(2301/100 000), Viana (1955/100 000) and Piuma (1418/100 000). That list is
now derived from the incidence of cases and not in relation to the absolute
number of notifications. This is because the incidence calculates the
number of cases of a disease over the number of inhabitants. The absolute
numbers do not take the number of inhabitants into account and, therefore,
do not show the actual situation determined by location. The Ministry of
Health considers 3 levels of dengue incidence: low (less than 100 cases per
100 000 inhabitants), medium (from 100-300 cases per 100 000 inhabitants)
and high (more than 300 cases per 100 000 inhabitants).

Deputy Ionilson Sampaio spoke of his concern in relation to the advance of
dengue in Roraima this Wednesday (9 [Jun 2010]) in the Legislative Assembly
of Roraima. The legislator indicated that public agencies need to intensify
their public awareness campaign to combat dengue, stating the importance of
public participation in this fight.

In 2008, 246 DHF cases were recorded, of which 2 died. This year [2010], up
to the month of May 2010, there are now 67 cases of DHF with 8 deaths.
Other data which draw attention are in relation to the locale of the dengue
mosquito vector foci registered by SEMSA [Secretariat of Health]. Normally,
we think of most foci as being in the peripheral areas of the city, but
this is not true. According to municipal data, the majority of the foci are
found in the central area of the city, said Ionilson.

[The 1st post-modern outbreak of dengue was in Roraima, and this is after
the elimination and reintroduction of _Aedes aegypti_ in Brazil. It was in
1982 that the virus was probably introduced from Venezuela; it was [dengue
virus] serotype 4 and was controlled in a relatively short time. Roraima is
our open door for serotype 4. - Mod.LJS

Mauricio L Nogueira <mnogueira@famerp.br> commented in a communication to
ProMED-PORT that in relation to Roraima as an open door for dengue virus 4,
it is worth restating that the door is now open. The circulation of dengue
virus 4 in Manaus (despite negative government reports) is very well
documented. Reports by Dr Filipe Naveca in the SBV and SBMT meetings are
indisputable. Mod.LJS added that he is in agreement: DENV-4 is in Brazil.
For some reason, it has not been widely disseminated, given that Roraima
continues as an open door. - Mod.TY]

Dengue fever has killed at least 7 Cambodians since early this year [2010],
a government officer said on Tuesday [15 Jun 2010]. Ngan Chantha, director
of National Dengue Control Program, said since early in 2010 to June 2010,
7 people have died of dengue fever, and 1111 cases of the disease were
recorded. Last week [week of 6 Jun 2010], the disease increased a bit more
in Phnom Penh, and in 3 other provinces of Kampong Cham, Kompong Thom, and
Siem Reap. Fearing continued spread of the disease, as many as 1000
Cambodians were holding [a] campaign to raise public awareness on Tuesday
[15 Jun 2010] in the central capital city of Phnom Penh.

Ngan Chantha said if proper medical care or treatment is not taken, or the
patients were careless, their lives are at risk regardless of whether they
are old or young.

There were 11 699 cases of dengue fever in 2009, 38 fatal.

[Although _Aedes aegypti_ is not present in Hong Kong, another competent
dengue virus vector, _Ae. albopictus_ is present there, with the risk of
ongoing dengue virus transmission from imported cases in this densely
populated city.
