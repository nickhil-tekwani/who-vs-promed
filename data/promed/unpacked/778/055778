A 23-year-old woman and a 70-year-old man from El Bebedero and Flores de Tonosi, respectively, are currently admitted to the Joaquin Pabl Fanco Sayas Hospital in Las Tablas with a fever from [a] hantavirus [infection]. This was confirmed by Yamileth de Dominguez, Medical Director of this hospital center.

Domiguez indicated that with these 2 new cases, a total of 45 cases have been detected in the Los Santos province so far in 2014. She further stated that of these [45], 38 are located in the Tonosi district. "Some 84 per cent of these cases of hantavirus [infection] are found in this Los Santo district," she reemphasized.

She indicated that a large area of crop cultivation in the Bebedero locality is propitious for the appearance of this disease.

[Although the hantavirus involved in this case is not specified, the one most likely responsible for these cases of HPS is Choclo virus, which is endemic in Los Santos Province. As mentioned in ProMED-mail archive no. 20130204.1527935, of the 3 hantaviruses known to occur in Panama, only Choclo is a known human pathogen, causing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, and can have a high case fatality rate, especially when victims come to the hospital late in the course of their disease. No specific ecological details are provided concerning the environment where these 2 patients may have acquired their infections, but the mention of extensive agricultural crops as a contributory factor in the appearance of cases is due the relationship of these crops and the presence of rodent hosts of Choclo virus.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg.
