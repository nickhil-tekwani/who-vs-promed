On Fri 13 May 2011, the Ministry of Health (MoH) of Uganda notified
WHO of a case of Ebola haemorrhagic fever in a 12-year-old girl from
Luwero district, central Uganda. On Fri 6 May 2011, she presented to a
private clinic in Zirobwe town, Luwero district with a 5-day history
of an acute febrile illness with haemorrhagic manifestations. She was
later referred to Bombo General Military Hospital where she died a few
hours after admission.

Laboratory investigations at the Uganda Virus Research Institute
(UVRI), Entebbe, Uganda confirmed ebolavirus (Sudan species). A sample
is on route to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
Atlanta, USA for additional analysis and sequencing.

A National Task Force has been convened by the MoH Uganda, which is
working with several partners including WHO, CDC, the African Field
Epidemiology Network (AFENET), and USAID. A joint MoH, WHO and CDC
team was deployed to the district on 13 May 2011 to carry out a
detailed epidemiological investigation. WHO will be supporting the MoH
in the areas of epidemiology and infection control.

Control activities already in place include active case finding and
contact tracing, enhanced surveillance, reinforcement of infection
prevention and control and of standard precautions in health care
settings.

WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be
applied to Uganda.
