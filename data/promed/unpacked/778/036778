The _Papaya ringspot virus_ (PRSV) continues to attack Ucayali's papaya plantations, in central Peru. It is currently present in 300 of the 1000 hectares [741 of 2471 acres] of the region.

This was reported by the Regional Sectorial Directorate for Agriculture. In order to reverse the situation, the National Agricultural Health Service (Senasa) and the National Institute for Agricultural Innovation (INIA) have prepared a test plantation using seeds of the hybrid 'Known-you No. 1', produced in Taiwan. The variety is being tested to ascertain if it can withstand the PRSV.

"The goal is for the imported genetic material to adapt to our region," they affirmed. The variety is already being cultivated close to the Iparia River [Ucayali department].

[_Papaya ringspot virus_ (PRSV; genus _Potyvirus_) is the major limiting factor to papaya (_Carica papaya_) production in many tropical regions. It occurs as 2 strains: PRSV-P, which infects both papaya and cucurbits (such as squash, pumpkin, cucumber, watermelon), and PRSV-W, which infects cucurbits only. Symptoms on papaya leaves may include yellowing, vein-clearing, mottling, and sometimes severe blistering and leaf distortion. Fruit symptoms are striking and consist of dark concentric rings and spots or C-shaped markings. Plant vigour, life span and fruit set may be severely reduced depending on host variety and age of the plant at infection. Fruit quality, particularly flavour, is also adversely affected.

The virus is spread by many species of aphids and with infected plants or seedlings. It does not survive in soil or dead plant material. PRSV is not usually regarded as being seed-transmitted, although seed transmission in one local papaya variety has been reported in the Philippines. Disease management may include quarantine measures, limiting sources of inoculum, and vector control. Use of certified clean planting material is essential.

Natural PRSV resistance does not exist in papaya. A few tolerant varieties are known which develop symptoms but can still provide useful yields when infected. Resistant crop varieties are being developed both by traditional breeding techniques using interspecific hybridisation with other _Carica_ species, and by using molecular techniques to insert the coat protein gene from local PRSV strains into the host. For example, in Hawaii transgenic papayas now represent 3 quarters of the total crop. The testing of the Taiwanese variety in Peru, as described above, is essential to determine its level of sensitivity to the local virus strain and its suitability to regional conditions.
