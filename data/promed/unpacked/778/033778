Anthrax outbreak has been reported in Dasmantpur block after 2 tribal [members] of S Dandabad were found to be affected by the disease. Five days back, some tribal [members] consumed beef in a function, following which abscesses were found among 2 of them.

On Monday [11 Nov 2019], they were taken to Damantpur CHC, where the doctors suspected that the 2 have contracted the disease [anthrax]. When the duo [were] sent to Koraput Medical College and Hospital, the doctors there confirmed the disease. Meanwhile, a medical team has been camping in the village, and they have started distributing medicines to check the spread of the disease. Two years back, more than 10 tribal [members] of the village had been afflicted with anthrax after consuming half-cooked meat.

Human anthrax from the consumption of sick livestock is an ongoing problem with the tribal groups in Koraput. Two recent postings are valuable in illustrating this and the component factors:
- 19 Aug 2019 Anthrax - India (08): (OR) cattle, human, toxic mushrooms 20190819.6630026
- 30 Jul 2019 Anthrax - India (07): (OR) human, review 20190730.6596419

As I have said before, a number of times, this situation report shines a bright light on why it is necessary to get ahead of this zoonotic disease and its human problems by routinely vaccinating the cattle. If the locals cannot be trusted or organised to do it themselves, it must be done for them. This carries a cost, granted, but it prevents the very much higher costs of treating human cases and deaths. Humans are not a cheap species to manage. - Mod.MHJ
