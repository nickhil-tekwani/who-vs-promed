A new bird flu strain detected in Europe which is similar to strains reported to be circulating in 2014 in Asia poses a significant threat to the poultry sector, especially in low-resourced countries along the Black Sea and East Atlantic migratory routes of wild birds, FAO and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) warned today [24 Nov 2014].

Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom have confirmed the new avian influenza virus strain H5N8 on poultry farms, and German authorities have also found the virus in a wild bird.

Early this year [2014], the People's Republic of China, Japan and the Republic of Korea reported outbreaks of H5N8 in poultry as well as findings in migratory birds and waterfowl. The fact that the virus has now been found within a very short time interval in 3 European countries, both in a wild bird and in 3 very different poultry production systems, is suggestive that wild birds may have played a role in spreading the virus, FAO and OIE experts said.

H5N8 has so far not been confirmed to infect people. However, it is highly pathogenic for domestic poultry, causing significant mortality in chickens and turkeys. The virus can also infect wild birds, which show little signs of illness. It is known from other influenza viruses that wild birds are able to carry the virus long distances.

Should poultry systems with low-biosecurity conditions become infected in countries with limited veterinary preparedness, the virus could spread through farms with devastating effects, both on vulnerable livelihoods as well as on country economies and trade. The best way for countries to safeguard against these impacts is to encourage better biosecurity and to maintain surveillance systems that detect outbreaks early and enable veterinary services to respond rapidly.

The new virus strain provides a stark reminder to the world that avian influenza viruses continue to evolve and emerge with potential threats to public health, food security and nutrition, to the livelihoods of vulnerable poultry farmers, as well as to trade and national economies. Therefore, extreme vigilance is strongly recommended, while progressive control efforts must be sustained and financed.

In particular, to protect poultry-related livelihoods and trade, FAO and OIE are recommending at-risk countries to:

- increase surveillance efforts for the early detection of H5N8 and other influenza viruses;
- maintain and further strengthen rapid response capacities of veterinary services;
- reinforce biosecurity measures, with particular emphasis on minimizing contact between domestic poultry and wild birds;
- raise awareness of hunters and other individuals who may come into contact with wildlife in order to provide early information on sick or dead wild birds.

The new strain of avian influenza has not resulted in human cases. Nevertheless, it is related to the H5N1 virus, which is known to have spread from Asia into Europe and Africa in 2005-2006. The H5N1 epidemic, in which wild birds have also been implicated, has caused the deaths of nearly 400 people and hundreds of millions of poultry to date. Therefore, prudent and precautionary interventions at the animal level are warranted.

[2] Netherlands: Surveillance in 10km zone around outbreak

32 chicken farms in the 10km zone around the infected farms in Kamperveen have been tested [by PCR]; no virus has been detected. Yet, the owners remain cautious. A poultry farm holder from the Mastenbroek Polder said: "We are really relieved, but we remain cautious."

Due to the quarantine measures applied, 200 000 eggs were withheld on the farm; so far, the damage has not been serious since they will be picked up today [24 Nov 2014]. However, the precautions should be kept in force for the time being [see item 3].

In the adjacent village, Kamperveen, the [HPAI H5N8] virus was discovered on 2 farms; eventually, all birds were culled on 3 farms.

[3] Netherlands, revised control measures

New measures have been ordered in the Netherlands against bird flu, according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

Secretary Dijksma has introduced a new package of measures. The national movement ban of 72 hours is replaced by a focused regional approach, with additional measures likely to remain in place for the coming weeks. Control zones around the infected farms in Hekendorp, Ter Aar and Kamperveen will remain in force. All measures are designed to prevent bird flu spread and are expected to remain in force for 21 days.

The country has been divided into 4 regions, between which the contacts are to be kept to a minimum. These regions are structured so that the 2 regions of high poultry density -- Gelderland valley and De Peel -- are in different regions as well as being in different control zones around the confirmed outbreak locations of Hekendorp, Ter Aar and Kamperveen.

These measures are based on disease prevention by minimising the contacts between poultry and other means of transmitting the virus, such as transport or people.

When transport is necessary, hygiene measures are very important, the Secretary stressed. No more than one poultry farm may be visited per trip to the slaughterhouse, and all transport crates should be cleaned and disinfected each time.

Moving poultry manure poses a significant risk, and, therefore, it remains prohibited.

In addition, no new poultry are to be supplied at present; the more birds there are, the higher the risk of contamination of other poultry farms. Calculations of the CVI show that the release of the virus is almost inevitable in regions with many poultry, leading to an epidemic. Therefore, it remains forbidden to transport day-old chicks to poultry farms in the Netherlands.

The transport of day-old chicks carries a very low health risk compared to other types of poultry, and so transport of day-old chicks from clean companies outside the 10km surveillance zone will be allowed, but only for export and under strict conditions.

A later report from the Ministry says that the bird flu virus has not been detected at any of the 32 poultry companies found in the 10km zone around Kamperveen.

[4] EU Reference AI lab report on the developing situation with H5N8 HPAI
Date: Mon 24 Nov 2014 [accessed]
Source: Report, extraordinary EU PAFF Committee meeting, Brussels 20 Nov 2014 [summarised, edited]
http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/docs/20141120_ah_avian-influenza_eurl.pdf


[The following summary is included in the presentation delivered by Ian Brown, Director EURL (Avian Influenza EU Reference Laboratory) during the extraordinary meeting of PAFF Committee, section Animal Health and Welfare, convened in Brussels on 20 Nov 2014, addressing "the developing situation with H5N8 HPAI." - Mod.AS]

Summary
1. Following the recent incidents involving detection of H5N8 HPAI in poultry in Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, the EURL have reviewed data available on the wild birds tested as part of the EU surveillance system from 2013, and preliminary data for 2014, in terms of spatial, temporal and species configuration. We have also included some ornithological data available in the public domain.

2. A passive surveillance system (testing birds found dead or ill) for avian influenza in wild birds is in place in EU Member States (MS) according to Commission Decision 2010/367/EU with the objective of timely detection of HPAI of subtype H5N1.

3. Infection with H5N8 HPAI lineage 2.3.4.6 has been found in many wild birds found dead in the Republic of Korea and also in apparently healthy wild mallards [ducks] in eastern China (_Anas platyrhynchos_) over the last 12 months.

4. Several of the species found infected with this lineage of H5N8 HPAI in East Asia also occur in Europe e.g. mallard, bean goose (_Anser fabalis_), white-fronted goose (_Anser albifrons_).

5. Wild waterbird flyways from the areas affected in Asia are predominantly north-south in orientation, and movement to EU MS of a significant number of these birds is highly unlikely. However, contiguous populations of some relevant species exist through this region, and movements of wild birds in west and central Asia to EU MS are more likely, e.g. Common Pochard (_Aythya ferina_) [duck].

6. If this virus were to be present in wild bird populations in the EU and cause significant morbidity or mortality, the wild bird passive surveillance activities of MS would have utility for the detection of this virus.

7. The sensitivity of the surveillance system in wild birds is likely to vary among MS and among regions within MS.

8. While the sensitivity of the surveillance is not equivalent to the number of wild birds tested over a period of time, this measure is likely to be an indicator of sensitivity when considering the relevance of the species involved.

9. Rapid evaluation indicates that the EU recommended diagnostic tests (Decision 2010/367/EU ) for the detection of influenza A viruses and specifically H5 by PCR as prescribed in the EU AI diagnostic manual (Decision 2006/437/EC) are fit for purpose and will reliably detect H5N8 HPAI.

[On 20 Nov 2014, EU's Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed (Section Animal Health & Welfare) held an extraordinary meeting in Brussels to exchange views and opinions on a draft of "Commission Implementing Decision concerning certain protective measures in relation to HPAI H5N8 in the Netherlands and the UK." During the meeting, the Netherlands, Germany and UK delivered their respective presentations on HPAI H5N8.

The report of the EU reference laboratory for avian influenza at Weybridge [UK] was presented by the lab's director, Ian Brown. Its summary is copied above. Subscribers are encouraged to approach the full report, which includes results of surveillance activities of wild birds in member states and extensive additional information on the current H5N8 HPAI virus strain worldwide: its origin, tests, genotyping results, and more. The reports of the 3 affected European countries include useful information (see at http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations_en.htm).

According to the Dutch follow-up report No. 2 to the OIE dated 22 Nov 2014, the outbreak in Kamperveen (in the eastern province Overijssel), confirmed as caused by HPAI H5N8, has thus become the 3rd Dutch outbreak since 14 Nov 2014. The affected population is "breeding poultry." Out of 10 000 susceptible birds on the farm, there were 500 recorded clinical cases (all died); 9500 remaining animals were destroyed.
