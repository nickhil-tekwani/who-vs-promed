Following a report nearly 2 months ago concerning the detection of _Borrelia burgdorferi_, the causative agent of Lyme disease being present in blacklegged (deer) ticks in all 67 counties of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania health authorities reported last week that the number of Lyme disease cases increased by 25 percent from 2013 to 2014, according to newly released data. In 2014, the Department of Health recorded 7400 cases of Lyme disease in the commonwealth, compared with 5900 cases in 2013.

The increase in cases can be attributed in part to heightened awareness about Lyme disease, better reporting, and enhanced monitoring efforts, particularly in Allegheny County. In fact, enhanced surveillance in Allegheny County saw an increase from 32 cases in 2013 to a whopping 822 cases seen in 2014. In addition to Allegheny County, Butler County reported 412 and Montgomery County saw 384 Lyme disease cases.

"Lyme disease is present in every county in Pennsylvania," said Pennsylvania Secretary of Health Dr. Karen Murphy, speaking at a press conference with Allegheny County Health Department Director Dr. Karen Hacker in Pittsburgh. "The prevalence of this illness serves as a reminder for people to better protect themselves from tick bites and to know the signs and symptoms of Lyme disease. For those with the disease it is important to seek early treatment to avoid any potential long-term health complications."

In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released estimates of 300 000 Americans diagnosed annually.

Lyme disease is an illness transmitted through the bite of an infected blacklegged tick (deer tick). Symptoms include fever, fatigue, headache, muscle aches and joint pain. A common early symptom is a red rash that looks like a bulls-eye. Ticks can be found everywhere, but individuals should be especially cautious in areas with dense bushes or tall grass. When outdoors, use repellents with diethyltoluamide (DEET) and protective clothing. After outdoor activities, check for ticks, and, if one is found, promptly remove it using fine-tipped tweezers and applying even pressure on the tick as it is being removed.

[The CDC changed the case definition of Lyme disease in 2011 to enhance case detection, but despite a steady increase in the number of Lyme disease cases reported in most of the state of Pennsylvania from 3379 cases in 2011 to 6331 cases in 2014, a steady decrease in number of reported cases of Lyme disease occurred in Philadelphia and its suburban counties (Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery, and Philadelphia Counties) in the southeastern part of the state from 1983 cases in 2011 to 1156 cases last year (2014) (http://www.philly.com/philly/infographics/Graphic_Lyme_disease_in_Pa.html?c=r).

A graph showing the changing incidence of Lyme disease (number of cases per 100 000 population) in Pennsylvania by region from 1987 when Lyme disease became reportable to 2014 is available at: http://www.health.pa.gov/My%20Health/Diseases%20and%20Conditions/I-L/Documents/Lyme%20Disease%20Fact%20Sheet%2006-04-15.pdf. CDC case definitions changed in 2008 and 2011.

A spreadsheet showing the number of cases by county from 1992 to 2014 is also available at this website. A footnote to the table says that "enhanced Lyme surveillance" was conducted in Butler, Delaware and York counties in 2012, and in Allegheny county in 2014, but only Allegheny county saw a dramatic increase in incidence from what had been less than 38 cases each year from 2008 to 2013 to 822 cases in 2014 (http://www.health.pa.gov/My%20Health/Diseases%20and%20Conditions/I-L/Documents/Lyme%20Disease%20Fact%20Sheet%2006-04-15.pdf).

The increased incidence of Lyme disease in Allegheny county could be due to a true increase in the number of cases as the primary tick vector (_Ixodes scapularis_) and the reservoir hosts of _Borrelia burgdorferi_ spread westerly into previously uninvolved regions and growth of suburban neighborhoods into surrounding wooded areas, but also better recognition and reporting in some counties may contribute to their increases in cases.
