More than 1000 people, most of them children, have been struck down by
cholera in the eastern DR-Congo, exacerbated by heavy flooding. A pack of
pictures taken in Kisangani shows a row of thin children with sinking eyes
lying in a cholera camp, with drips hanging above their beds to replace
lost fluids. Kisangani is the largest city in the east of the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC), on the border with Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi.
"The situation is pathetic there. Everybody is scared of the cholera
epidemic," said a photographer, just back from the city. The photographer,
who was hired by a European non-governmentalorganization (ngo), told IPS
this week that the disease was claiming the lives of children more than any
other group. Confirming this, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
office in Kisangani reported that the epidemic -- which escalated after
heavy flooding in the region in late December -- had claimed 231 lives and
struck 1235 people, the majority of whom are children.

Liberia's health minister, Dr Peter Coleman, Wednesday said cholera has
broken out in south-eastern Maryland County, where the disease has struck
about 150. "We have recorded three deaths at the moment," he told PANA. He
added that most of the victims are children aged between 5 and 15 years.
Coleman explained disease broke out due to unavailability of safe drinking
water in Maryland County, some 290 km from Monrovia. But he said his
ministry has already sent a medical team to the area to help contain the
disease.

other people have been hospitalized. Ahindukha said the disease had been

Mukumu and the Kakamega Provincial GeneralHospital. Ahindukha said the most
affected areas were Ikhobero in Tiriki location, Shiruli, Lukose, Khwirenyi
and Lukongo in Shibuye and Khayega locations. He said since the outbreak
last week, more people may have died as the victims were immediately buried
to curb the spread of the disease. He banned eating at funerals and warned
that those found contravening the ban will be arrested. Ahindukha said his
officers had reported lack of latrines as the main cause
of the cholera outbreak. He urged chiefs and their assistants to ensure
that toilet facilities are put up immediately. He said public health
officers have been dispatched to the division to enforce the ban on hawking
and selling of cooked food at the market centers. The officers will also
supply drugs to local health centers for treatment of the disease.

while 11 others in a critical condition. He however noted that most deaths

Mukono district director of health services, Dr Elly Tumushabe, has
dismissed reports that there is a cholera outbreak in the district. He said
there is no way such a closely monitored disease could have taken the
district's satellite units unaware. Dr Tumushabe was responding to a report
in the May 27 issue of Bukedde, a Luganda daily, that 5 people, 2 from the
same house, died of cholera in Kanjuki village, Namukuma parish, Busaana
sub-county on May 25. He said a system surveillance officer at Kayunga
Hospital is in contact with both the
grassroots and district medical department, and he couldn't have failed to
note the incidents. He added that the multiplier effect of a cholera case
has a fast and big effect, that within a few hours, many people would have
died.

At least 3 people have died from cholera in Honduras's border region with
El Salvador, and seven new cases of the disease have been reported, a
Health Ministry official said Thursday. The deaths have all occurred in the
town of Yarula, in the province of La Paz bordering with El Salvador,
according to the Health Ministry's cholera control officer, Leonel Guillen.
Seven other Yarula residents have also been infected with the sickness,
adding to the 6 cases already recorded this year in other parts of
Honduras. Guillen said the incidence of cholera in Yarula constitutes an
epidemic, and measures have been established to control the spread of the
disease, introduced in Yarula by individuals who became infected in El
Salvador. El Salvador has reported hundreds of cases of cholera, prompting
Honduran authorities to set up epidemiological barriers.

The State Sanitary and Epidemiologic Service has warned of a new cholera
outbreak in Russia. Chief sanitary doctor Gennady Onishchenko has ordered
sanitary and quarantine authorities to pay special attention to people
arriving in Russia from countries where cholera is commonplace. According
to the World Health Organization, 17 440 cholera cases were reported in the
world in the first four months of 2000. Nine hundred people died. In 1999,
there were 206 657 cholera cases in 56 countries and 6883 people died.
Outbreaks of cholera were reported last year in the Primorsky Territory and
the Sakhalin regions of Russia. They were caused by infection brought in
from China. Cholera strains were found in 17 regions of Russia.

Officials at the National Institute of Health said yesterday that most
epidemic diseases, such as bacillary dysentery, food poisoning, malaria,
cholera and typhoid have shown little sign of increasing this year compared
with previous years. But the NIH put health officials across the country on
special alert for highly contagious diseases out of concern that rising
temperatures may contribute to disease outbreaks. According to NIH figures,
315 people have come down with dysentery so far this year, about half the
648 reported during the same
period last year. The number of food poisoning victims also declined to 958
this year, about 33 percent of last year's 2,870. Cases of typhoid and
malaria also decreased to 65 and 56, respectively, in the first four months
of this year from 114 and 61 in the same period last year. Health
authorities are staying especially vigilant for dysentery as the disease
has been spreading in southern parts of the country since earlier this
month. It was reported yesterday that several suspected dysentery sufferers
were also discovered in Taegu and Kumi, North Kyongsang Province. This came
in the wake of reports of more than 100 possible cases in Pusan and Kochang
in South Kyongsang Province, and Kwangju and Haenam in South Cholla
Province. In Pusan, doctors have so far diagnosed 104 cases of dysentery
among some 400 elementary school students and their parents who visited a
"prayer house" in Taegu for five days from May 8. Of the confirmed
patients, 49 are in isolation for intensive treatment. Officials fear that
the number of patients may continue to increase ahead of May 24, when the
NIH is slated to complete examinations of those who participated in the
tour and about 5000 people who came in contact with them. At the moment,
the officials assume that patients contracted the epidemic from
contaminated underground water at the prayer house. Kochang also reported 2
dysentery patients and 100 others who are suffering from diarrhea, a
typical symptom of the epidemic.

The residential campus of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS)
appears to be in the grip of typhoid with as many as 14 cases being
reported within a month. Sources in the institute said that this year the
typhoid cases appeared to be caused by a resistant type of bacteria as the
patients, some of them who are children of the faculty members, were not
responding to the usual antibiotics.

Doctors are describing as grim the situation arising out of a spurt in
cases of gastroenteritis and jaundice in many parts of New Delhi,
especially areas under the Trans-Yamuna and north-west Delhi. According to
Delhi Medical Association (DMA) president-elect Dr V K Monga, the picture
is grim in east Delhi. "Over 50 per cent of my out-patient department cases
are of gastroenteritis and jaundice is also on the rise," he said. The
worst-hit are Krishna Nagar, Azad Nagar, Kanti Nagar and Vishwas Nagar. The
situation in north-west Delhi is not much better. The heat wave conditions
and polluted water in Delhi led to an increase in gastroenteritis in April
and May, said Dr Naresh Chawla, practicing physician in Pritampura and DMA
vice-president. Despite increased awareness and good hygienic practices
being observed by people, this seasonal disease continues to afflict many
areas, including affluent colonies in south and central Delhi, say doctors.
Dr Monga claimed that 99 per cent reported gastroenteritis cases are
water-borne.
