Japanese encephalitis -- a form of brain fever -- has hit the state
capital and its neighbouring areas. At least 10-12 cases of the
disease are being reported at Patna Medical College and Hospital
(PMCH) daily over the past few days. Dr Nigam Prakash Narayan, a
senior doctor at the paediatrics ward of the hospital, said: "About
250 patients of encephalitis have been admitted to the hospital so
far. Of them, around 100 are down with Japanese encephalitis [virus
infection]. This is apart from high number of cases registered at the
government medical college in Gaya. The mortality rate of Japanese
encephalitis patients is about 20-25 per cent. Thus, the disease has
taken an epidemic form in the state."

Dr Narayan said: "Most of the patients coming to the hospital are from
Patna, Hajipur, Muzaffarpur, and Chhapra districts. Several of them
are in critical condition."

With the number of suspected Japanese encephalitis cases on the rise,
the PMCH authorities are finding it tough to cope with the pressure of
patients. The health hub is running short of beds as well as
medicines. "Many Japanese encephalitis patients are lying on the floor
as beds are not available. We are also running short of required
medicines. Worse, there is no special arrangements for such patients
though new cases are pouring in every day," a senior officer of the
hospital said.

Experts said Japanese encephalitis [JE] is caused [by JE virus
transmitted] by the bites of _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ mosquitoes. The
symptoms of Japanese encephalitis include high fever, headache and
nausea, bouts of unconsciousness or convulsions, altered sensorium or
impact on sensory part of the brain, chills, confusion and agitation,
rigidity of neck, lethargy, and inability to talk or feel anything.

Doctors suggested people to use medicated mosquito nets and repellents
to avoid getting infected. They also asked to keep rooms of children,
especially infants and toddlers, spick and span.

Dr Narayan said: "It is high time the state government took up some
extensive programmes like sprinkling of insecticides in affected areas
to stop the menace immediately."

Today in Gaya, 6 persons reportedly died of Japanese encephalitis
[virus infection]. With this, the toll touched 68.

State health department officials said measures were being taken to
curb the spread of the disease. "We have identified 420 villages in
Gaya where malathion is sprayed to kill mosquitoes. Also, people are
being advised to keep pigs away from human habitation as they act as
vectors of the disease [pigs are amplifying hosts of JE virus. Wild
birds are the reservoirs and mosquitoes are the vectors. - Mod.TY]
Some stray cases are being reported from other districts as well and
we are trying our best to stop the spread of the disease. It is also
important that people keep their house and surroundings clean and
maintain personal hygiene," said Sanjay Kumar, the secretary of the
health department.

The deputy chief malaria officer SK Aman, has asked the Gaya civil
surgeon to seek help of the welfare and education departments and the
municipal corporations to contain the disease.

Around 308 Japanese encephalitis patients have got admitted to Anugrah
Narayan Magadh Medical College and Hospital till today. The 1st case
was reported on 23 Aug [2011].
