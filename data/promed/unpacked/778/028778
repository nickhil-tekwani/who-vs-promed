Backed by a Sh 3.5 billion [about USD 980 000] outbreak response, Uganda has contained the recent Marburg viral disease outbreak and declared the country free of the infectious disease. The declaration comes after completion of 42 days of the post-Marburg surveillance countdown period for the contacts of the last confirmed case, as per the World Health Organization (WHO) requirement for declaring an end to an outbreak of any viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF). "Today [17 Dec 2017], marks 42 days since the death of the last confirmed case which occurred on 26 Oct 2017, indicating that the outbreak which occurred in Kween and Kapchorwa districts has been contained. The Ministry officially declares the country free from Marburg disease," said State Minister of health in charge of General Duties, Sarah Opendi, on [8 Dec 2017].

The 1st reported case was 35-year-old herdsman from Kween district who had made frequent hunting missions to Kaptum sub-county, where there are caves with large populations of Egyptian fruit bats, and died after exhibiting signs of Marburg [virus infection] on 25 Sep 2017. Other people developed signs and others that had been in contact with them were isolated at various centers in Eastern Uganda. By [16 Nov 2017] all those under surveillance had completed their 21 days of monitoring to account for the 21-day incubation period of the virus. An additional 21 days of intensive surveillance was carried out in the affected districts to comply with the WHO requirement for management and control of viral haemorrhagic fevers and registered no other confirmed patients.

Marburg is a highly infectious viral haemorrhagic fever that is spread through direct contact with body fluids such as blood, saliva, vomitus, stool and urine of an infected person.

[With the West Africa Ebola virus disease outbreak still fresh in mind, it is nice to be able to post good news about the end of the Marburg virus disease outbreak in Uganda. The proactive surveillance of contacts was prudent to detect any additional new cases that might have occurred. Fortunately, no new cases were found.

There have been sporadic cases of Marburg virus disease in Uganda in the past:
- 2007: 4 cases, including 2 deaths in Ibanda district, western Uganda;
- 2008: 2 unrelated cases in travellers returning to the Netherlands and USA, respectively after visiting caves in western Uganda;
- 2012: 15 cases, including 4 deaths in Ibanda and Kabale districts, western Uganda; and
- 2014: 1 case in healthcare professional from Mpigi district, central Uganda.

The virus undoubtedly remains endemic in bats in the country, and one hopes that public education will result in less human contact with bats there. - Mod.TY
