At least 37 cases and 21 Ebola deaths are reported in North Kivu province, where an outbreak of hemorrhagic disease was declared on 1 Aug [2018] after the one conquered in Equateur to the west. A total of "37 cases of Ebola are reported in Beni including 21 deaths and a suspected case in Musienene in the Lubero territory", reports Top Congo, a VOA radio partner in the DRC, citing a summary of the Council of Ministers chaired by the Deputy Governor of North Kivu, Feller Lutaichirwa.

The Minister of Health, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, visited Beni and Mangina the day before [31 Jul 2018] with experts and said he identified "needs and challenges" in the response to the new epidemic of Ebola in the east of the DRC. "The teams of the DRC Ministry of Health are already working to contain this new Ebola outbreak," he added.

For its part, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that it will challenging to stop the new Ebola epidemic in the DRC, which is rife in a war zone where humanitarian workers do not move without armed escort. "On the scale of difficulty, trying to extinguish an outbreak of a deadly dangerous pathogen in a war zone is at the top," said the WHO Deputy Director General in charge of emergency responses, Peter Salama, during a press briefing in Geneva.

WHO now considers that the risk to public health is high at the national and regional levels. Globally, risk is currently considered low.

The disease has been reported in Mangina, a village 30 km southwest of Beni in troubled North Kivu province (east). The province of North Kivu reported Saturday [28 Jul 2018] "the Ministry of Health [reports] 26 cases of fever with hemorrhagic signs, including 20 deaths," said the Minister of Health, Dr. Oly Ilunga, without specifying the date of deaths or whether they were proven or suspected cases of Ebola.

"Of the 6 samples tested by the INRB (National Institute of Biomedical Research) on the night of Tue 31 Jul 2018, 4 were positive for the Ebola virus serotype Zaire," wrote the ministry in a statement. The disease was reported in Mangina, "likely [the] epicenter of this tenth epidemic," according to the authorities.

Thursday [2 Aug 2018], a delegation of Congolese experts and officials of the various partner agencies of the DRC went to the region "to assess the situation and needs on the ground," said a statement from the Ministry of Health. At a first meeting, Mr. Ilunga "explained the principles and components of the response to be put in place."

The headquarters of the coordination of the response has been installed in Beni, where the "mobile laboratory is operational" since Thursday afternoon [2 Aug 2018], the statement said.

"Ebola is a permanent threat in the DRC," responded the Director General of the World Health Organization, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. "By working closely with the Ministry of Health and its partners, we will fight this crisis as we did last time," he added, announcing the new outbreak.

A team of WHO experts whose epidemiologists arrived in Mangina; "our colleagues who were still in Mbandaka are on their way to reinforce the teams there to organize the response," said AFP Eugene Kabambi, WHO communication officer in the DRC. "It's about working urgently on following up contacts to break the chain of transmission" of the disease, he said.

[2] Risk
- Thu 2 Aug 2018. WHO says that new Ebola outbreak in DR Congo Kivu Province poses high regional risk, given proximity to borders, particularly Uganda. Ebola Zaire strain confirmed
[US News and World Report, edited]

[Byline: Tom Miles and Fiston Mahamba]


An Ebola outbreak in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is likely to spread over tens of kilometres and poses a high regional risk given its proximity to borders, a World Health Organization (WHO) official said on Thu [2 Aug 2018].

A total of 4 people have tested positive for Ebola in and around Mangina, a town of about 60 000 people in North Kivu province, 100 km (62 miles) from the Ugandan border, the health ministry said. Another 20 people died from unidentified haemorrhagic fevers in the area, mostly in the second half of July [2018].

Just last week [22-28 Jul 2018], a previous outbreak on the other side of the Central African country was declared over after killing 33 people. "It would appear that the risk, as we can surmise for DRC, is high. For the region it's high given the proximity to borders, particularly Uganda," said WHO's emergency response chief, Peter Salama. "We are talking about tens of kilometres but I stress that this is very preliminary information at this stage."

Ebola is believed to be transported long distances by bats and can find its way into bush meat sold at local markets and eaten. Once present in humans, it causes haemorrhagic fever, vomiting and diarrhoea and is spread through direct contact with body fluids. Over 11 300 people died of an epidemic in West Africa from 2013 to 2016.

This is the vast, forested central African country's 10th outbreak since 1976, when the virus was discovered near Congo's Ebola river in the north. That is more than twice as many epidemics as any other country.

The response to Congo's previous outbreak was considered a success despite the 33 deaths, as the use of a vaccine made by Merck helped contain the virus. The kind of Ebola in the latest outbreak has been confirmed as the Zaire strain that the Merck vaccine protects against, Congo's health ministry said late on Thursday [2 Aug 2018]. This should allow health officials to again use what has become the greatest weapon against Ebola epidemics to date.

Still, this outbreak poses new challenges. Eastern Congo is a tinderbox of conflicts over land and ethnicity stoked by decades of on-off war, and this could hamper efforts to contain the virus. About 1000 civilians have been killed by armed groups and government soldiers around Beni since 2014, and the wider region of North Kivu holds over 1 million displaced people.

Officials in Mangina rushed on Thu [2 Aug 2018] to educate people about the risks of spreading the virus in a town that one local nurse told Reuters had no ambulance service. Agents were deployed to warn people about the need for strict hygiene, and the local radio station passed on messages about how to act, a local journalist said by phone.

"There is a great panic among the local population following the appearance of the Ebola epidemic," said a nurse by phone, who asked not to be named. The hospital where she works has already seen 3 people die recently of haemorrhagic fever. The hospital was awaiting help from the Red Cross to bury the bodies properly, she said.

Meanwhile, Uganda has set up screening at the land border it shares with Congo and at its Entebbe international airport. "Ebola is highly infectious so we have put in place measures," Uganda's Junior Health Minister Sarah Achieng Opendi told Reuters. An international delegation including officials from the United Nations, the World Bank and the WHO is in Beni, 30 km from Mangina.

- Thu 2 Aug 2018. The latest Ebola outbreak is centered in a war zone
[The New York Times, edited]

[excerpt]
... North Kivu Province, the volatile region in the Democratic Republic of Congo where the new outbreak is centered, creates security complications that health officials did not confront in the outbreak they just defeated in northwest Ã‰quateur Province, 1550 miles away. The World Health Organization is worried about the safety of medical workers in North Kivu and their access to areas controlled by militants.

"This new cluster is occurring in an environment which is very different from where we were operating in the northwest," said Dr. Peter Salama, the deputy director general of the health agency and the head of its emergency response unit. "This is an active conflict zone. The major barrier will be safely accessing the affected population."

The new cases are in and around the remote village of Mangina, near the city of Beni and the border with Uganda. The area has been chronically plagued by fighting between government forces and armed rebel groups. Last year, 15 United Nations peacekeepers were killed in an attack on a compound in North Kivu.

The region also hosts more than one million people displaced by conflict throughout the country and shares porous borders with Rwanda and Uganda. The World Health Organization said it was working with those neighboring nations to ensure that they were prepared to respond to the disease.

But aid groups fear that the fighting and humanitarian crisis in North Kivu will only compound the difficulties of defeating Ebola. People on the move can frustrate the critical need to determine chains of infection.

"People are hungry and at risk of disease, and many have had to flee their homes," said Jose Barahona, Oxfam's country director for the Democratic Republic of Congo. "Ebola poses a serious risk to communities already on the edge and threatens our ability to help them."

Michelle Gayer, the director of emergency health for the International Rescue Committee, said the new outbreak's location made it unlike what she saw in Ã‰quateur and West Africa. "We are in a different context again in the sense that, yes, it's actually in small rural areas that we know of to date; however, it's in a zone where there has been a lot of insecurity and a lot of armed groups and a large amount of displacement," Ms. Gayer said.

Simply getting to an affected community, she said, would be challenging. "It is already hard because of geography," Ms. Gayer explained. "And we can only go where we can go if there is this insecurity."

Lack of basic resources after years of war, including limited health care, puts North Kivu residents further at risk. Ebola can often spread through community gatherings or funerals, or through contamination at health clinics.

The Health Ministry said a team of 12 experts arrived in the affected area on Thursday [2 Aug 2018], with a mobile laboratory and protective equipment to begin a coordinated response. The ministry also said additional security measures were in place to ensure the protection of health care workers. The World Health Organization also began sending experts to the area.

"Since we are coming out of another Ebola outbreak, we have kept staff and equipment in place," said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, the organization's regional director for Africa. "This allows us to have a head start in response to this cluster."

- Fri 3 Aug 2018. WHO: Ebola DRC outbreak taking place in "war zone"
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/08/who-ebola-drc-outbreak-taking-place-war-zone


The new Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is taking place in a war zone with difficult access, among other challenges, Peter Salama, MD, the World Health Organization's (WHO's) deputy director-general of emergency response, said in a telebriefing today.

While only 4 Ebola cases have been confirmed, Salama said there are 20 deaths near the town of Mangina that were possibly caused by the virus. So far 10 locations near Mangina have been identified as having possible cases.

"It's extremely likely that it's Ebola-Zaire," said Salama, echoing the DRC's ministry of health's assessment of the species causing the illnesses. Salama said a full genetic analysis of samples will be available next Tue [7 Aug 2018].

What is known is that on 28 Jul 2018 in North Kivu province, a suspicious cluster of cases and deaths alerted DRC officials, who began to collect samples. The inciting incident, Salama said, was a woman who visited a local hospital for an illness in late July [2018].

"As she was leaving the hospital after being treated for another ailment, she started getting a fever and other symptoms of Ebola," Salama said. The woman died, and 7 of her relatives developed similar symptoms. Salama also said a healthcare worker has died in this outbreak, but it's unknown if that person treated the woman.

While it cannot be ruled out, Salama said there's no evidence to suggest this outbreak is related to the one that ended on 24 Jul 2018. That outbreak took 33 lives on the western side of DRC.

The Equatorial rainforest, which reaches across DRC, provides a reservoir for the Ebola virus. Most often, the virus jumps from animals to humans through fruit bats or the consumption of raw or partially cooked bush meats. The Zaire species of the virus is the most deadly to humans, with a case-fatality rate usually near 50%.

Salama said the current outbreak will be an extremely challenging one for the WHO and the DRC to fight because of location. Rebel fighters populate the region, which is home to one million displaced people. Unlike the outbreak this spring, health workers will not be able to cross rural expanses on motorcycles or easily reach communities because of safety issues.

"This is a war zone, and the one very serious complex factor is security," Salama said. "Access will be the biggest challenge."

If genetic analysis proves definitively that the virus is the Zaire species, Merck's unlicensed vaccine is expected to be used in a ring vaccination, as it was in the previous DRC outbreak, which was just declared over. According to Salama, there are 3000 doses of VSV-EBOV vaccine immediately available, and 300 000 more doses can be mobilized in short notice.

The DRC also published an update yesterday, confirming that the minister of health, Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, visited Beni and Mangina. A mobile lab is being set up in Beni.

[3] Response
- Thu 2 Aug 2018. Response to new Ebola outbreak in DR Congo Kivu Province "highly complex." International health experts have arrived in region
[STL News, edited]
https://www.stl.news/dakar-senegal-response-congos-new-ebola-outbreak-highly-complex/150545/
[Byline: Ashley Howard]


The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies says the response to the new Ebola virus outbreak in Congo's North Kivu province will be "highly complex" given the armed unrest in the region. Dr. Fatoumata Nafo-Traore, regional director for Africa, says the proximity to a city of more than 230 000 people and an international border also complicates the response.

Congo's health ministry on Wed [1 Aug 2018] announced 4 Ebola cases in Mangina village, about 30 kilometers from Beni city. It says 20 people have died from a hemorrhagic fever.

The outbreak comes just over a week after Congo declared the end of an outbreak in the northwest that killed 33 people. The World Health Organization says the outbreaks are likely not linked. International health experts have arrived in the region.

- Fri 3 Aug 2018. Congo to use Ebola vaccine as early as next week: health minister
[Reuters, edited]

[Byline: Benoit Nyemba]


Democratic Republic of Congo will start using an Ebola vaccine as early as next week [5-11 Aug 2018] to counter a new flare-up in the heavily populated eastern part of the Central African country, which emerged just as an earlier outbreak was being pronounced over.

Officials are already taking steps to deploy a vaccine manufactured by Merck, which has become the greatest weapon against the spread of the virulent Zaire strain of the virus and which helped contain the earlier outbreak. "I think we can start using the vaccine as early as next week [5-11-Aug 2018]," Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga told Reuters on Fri [3 Aug 2018]. About 3000 doses were stored in the capital Kinshasa after the last outbreak, he said. Another 300 000 doses could be supplied at short notice, the WHO has said.

"All teams on the way are being briefed and we are working on the cold chain," he said, referring to the complex measures needed to keep the vaccine well below zero in a tropical climate without reliable power supplies. "All this will be available very quickly."

Ebola, which causes hemorrhagic fever, vomiting, diarrhea and frequently death in humans, finds a natural home in Congo's dense equatorial forests, where infected bats are suspected of transporting it long distances.

Health officials have given new details about how the latest outbreak came to light. One key event was the death and unsafe burial of a 65-year-old woman in Mangina in late July [2018], the World Health Organization said on Fri [3 Aug 2018]. She had been admitted to hospital but then released after showing signs of recovery.

"On discharge (she) came down with a fever and other symptoms that were clinically consistent with Ebola," WHO's emergency response chief Peter Salama told reporters in Geneva. "This is what really raised the alarm. She had fever, vomiting, bloody nose and bloody diarrhea as a final set of symptoms." He said 7 of the woman's immediate family later also died from Ebola-like symptoms, and health workers were now trying to track down potential contacts in 10 locations spread over tens of kilometers.

A health worker is believed to be among the dead, Salama said. There were now suspected cases in the busy nearby town of Beni and the neighboring Ituri province.

WHO is working with Uganda and Rwanda in case the virus travels out of Congo with refugee flows. Uganda has set up Ebola screenings at its land and airport borders.

Salama said scientists were trying to determine whether the eastern Congo outbreak was related to the earlier one in the west. "We cannot rule out that this is connected to the previous outbreak. What we can say is that there is no evidence to suggest there is a concrete link," Salama said. Genetic sequencing results are expected on Tuesday [7 Aug 2018].

https://www.radiookapi.net/2018/08/03/actualite/sante/ebola-beni-david-gressly-felicite-le-gouvernement-pour-la-reponse-rapide


Deputy Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General in the DRC, David Gressly congratulates the Congolese government for the rapid response it provides in the response to Ebola virus disease declared in the Mangina health area of Mabalako, territory of Beni, in North Kivu Province.

"I came to accompany the Minister of Health to organize the response. I would like to congratulate the government for this quick response. He came with teams. We will visit Mangina. All this means that the response is already under way. MONUSCO will accompany this response. We will give mainly logistical assistance. If there is a need for support on the security side, we will do it. We are here to listen, to receive the needs and after all these details, we will begin the implementation of our support, "said David Gressly when he arrived in Beni.

A joint government-MONUSCO delegation led by the Minister of Health and the Deputy Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General in the DRC arrived Thursday [2 Aug 2018] in Beni. This mission is part of the response to the outbreak of Ebola declared in the Beni territory.

[4] Treatment
- Fri 3 Aug 2018. Ebola outbreak in DRC sets up another test for experimental treatments
[STAT News, edited]
https://tinyurl.com/y8kumoml
[Byline: Helen Branswell]


In the world of Ebola outbreaks, lucky breaks are few and far between. But it appears the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) may have caught a small one in its latest go-round with the dangerous disease. And it might also give the world another shot at testing an experimental Ebola vaccine.

Officials in the DRC said Thu [2 Aug 2018] that testing has shown that the virus causing disease in North Kivu province in the northeast of the country is Ebola Zaire. That is the virus targeted by Merck's experimental vaccine, which was tested during the West African outbreak in 2014 and 2015, and used in eastern DRC in an outbreak earlier this year.

There had been concerns that, given the location of the outbreak, another species of Ebola might have been causing the illnesses. That would have meant few possibilities for experimental drugs and potentially no vaccines options.

Despite the potential of a vaccine to help in this outbreak, delivering it could prove challenging, warned Dr. Peter Salama, the head of the World Health's Organization's emergency response program. Battling factions operate in the area, and there are roughly one million displaced people the province. The danger inherent in operating in this part of DRC means a modified approach to the vaccination rollout may be needed, Salama said.

In the outbreak earlier this year [2018] in DRC, health officials used a ring vaccination program, in which they tracked down the contacts of cases and the contacts of those contacts, and offered them all vaccine in a bid to halt spread. That approach might not be viable in North Kivu.

"The ring vaccination strategy is highly dependent on access, and really strong access to the population that's being targeted," Salama told STAT. "The ring vaccination is really the big question mark [here]."

Salama said consideration is being given to an "out-in strategy," which would create a ring around an area where there had been cases, rather than trying to find and vaccinate specific individuals. The idea would be to start "with a protective buffer around a whole geographical zone," and then moving inward, offering vaccine to everyone in the area.

A lot will depend on how freely the vaccine teams can travel. And that will be determined in negotiations with the United Nations peacekeeping operation in the region.

"We're discussing with the UN what the security ceiling will be for the number of staff that they'll allow us to deploy," Salama said. "And also what sort of armed vehicles, armed escorts, or otherwise that we'll need to use. And that's going to make it much more difficult."

If officials are able to deliver the vaccine, there is reason to hope that people in the area will be willing to use it. During the earlier outbreak, in Bikoro, nearly 3500 people were vaccinated, and vaccine acceptance was extraordinarily high. Over 98% of people offered the vaccine agreed to be vaccinated.

The fact that the Ebola Zaire virus is the cause of the outbreak also opens up the most options for experimental drugs to treat patients. In addition to the Merck vaccines, supplies of 5 potential therapeutics are already in the country, having been sent during the Bikoro outbreak.

[The Ministry of Health in the DRC and the supporting international community know the Ebola drill well by now, and appear to have adopted lessons learned in the previous outbreaks. However, each location where Ebola outbreaks have occurred has its unique problems, and this latest outbreak in North Kivu poses new and probably the most difficult challenges yet faced, as discussed in these posts, and others not discussed. For one, this region includes dense rainforest areas with oil and mineral extraction, recently put in place presumably with road networks to transportation hubs. These road networks facilitate movement of people and, consequently, movement of virus, making control that much more difficult. Further questions to be answered are (1) Will aid and military workers be offered vaccination? (2) How will they be able to follow-up postvaccination and drug treatments? - Rap.MM

The cold chain to maintain the vaccine again presents a challenge, and it is not clear whether there are health centers throughout the region to facilitate distribution of the vaccine and treatment of cases. But the greatest problems are associated with the large number of displaced unsettled people and the safety of the health care workers. Both will make identification of and access to contacts of sick individuals extremely difficult. It would be great if the country could come together at this critical time to get through this crisis. - Mod.LK
