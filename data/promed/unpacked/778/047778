[As always, ProMED-mail requests information on the country from which
these cases were imported & the type of cholera involved. We are especially
interested in the spread of type O139. We would also remind countries that
they have an obligation under the International Health Regulations to
report cases of cholera, plague & yellow fever to the World Health
Organization, *even if unconfirmed*, immediately, & not after a delay of a
few weeks as in this case. - Mod.JW
