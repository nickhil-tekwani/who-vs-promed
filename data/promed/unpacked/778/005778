Three cases of primary amebic meningoencephalitis found in Texas
----------------------------------------------------------------
Three fatal cases of primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) -- boys aged
8 and 9 years and a 9 year old girl -- have been reported to the Texas
Department of Health since 1 August 2001. All had been exposed to large
(greater than 10 square miles) bodies of fresh water (varying depth) in the
week prior to death. The specific areas of the lakes where the exposures
may have occurred have not been identified. _Naegleria fowleri_ was
identified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from all three.
Thirty-two cases of amebic meningitis have been reported in Texas since the
first report in 1972. _N. fowleri_ was identified from the CSF or brain
tissue in 27 of the cases. According to the laboratory reports three cases
were caused by _Balmuthia_ species, one was due to a leptomyxid ameba, and
one was caused by an unidentified ameba. Twenty-two of the 32 cases
occurred during July and August. The earliest case occurred in January; the
latest in November.

September / 3 / _Naegleria_ 2, unidentified 1
October / 0 / -
November / 1 / _Naegleria_ (reported exposure in Mexico)
December / 0 / -
The ages of the cases range from 11 months to 37 years. Twenty-four cases
were male (average age 10 years; range 3 to 27 years) and 8 were female
(average 14 years; range 11 months to 37 years).

[Free living amebae are common in fresh water, where they rarely cause
conjunctivitis and meningitis. The infection is very difficult to treat but
very rare, illustrated by the small number of recorded cases. With a
hundred cases recorded during the past 30 years, the risk of infection in
the US is very low and clustering of three cases is unusual, but the data
on the cases diagnosed in Texas show a seasonal peak in July and August. -
