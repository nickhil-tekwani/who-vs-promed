[This cluster of gastroenteritis may be related to a common food perhaps eaten in a cafeteria or spread from person to person. No etiology is given, but this could be made by a "gastrointestinal panel," looking for a variety of pathogens through their genetic markers. - Mod.LL

Any additional information on this outbreak would be appreciated. - Mod.JH
