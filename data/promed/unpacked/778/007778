Alberta Pork says a 2nd case of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) has turned up in this province. It is at a 600-head farrow-to-finish operation, but the producer group does not say in what part of the province it was detected. Alberta Pork and Alberta Agriculture and Forestry are working together on an investigation.

The 1st PED outbreak in Alberta was detected in January 2019 at a 400-head farm [Porcine epidemic diarrhea - North America: Canada (AB) 1st report 20190109.6249960].

Investigators have not found a source from the outbreak but earlier ruled out transport and other livestock.

Alberta Pork is encouraging producers to keep strict biosecurity procedures in place and remind them that anywhere off-farm is a possible source of the disease.

[Since its appearance in the United States in April 2013, PEDv has spread within the swine industry in both the US and Canada. In early 2014, an additional related virus, porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV), appeared in the US. Infections with these novel SECD (swine enteric coronavirus disease) viruses can cause significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in young piglets.

More information regarding PED may be found in the moderator's comments in ProMED post Porcine epidemic diarrhea - North America: Canada (AB) 1st report 20190109.6249960. - Mod.TG
