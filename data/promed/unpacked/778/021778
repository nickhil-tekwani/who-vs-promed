Study finds MERS virus on surfaces in Korean treatment units
------------------------------------------------------------
A small study in South Korea has determined that most touchable surfaces in MERS treatment units were contaminated by patients and healthcare workers, and that viable virus was shed through respiratory secretions even after patients recovered.

Writing in Clinical Infectious Diseases yesterday [17 Dec 2015], Korean investigators detailed findings on 4 MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) patients in the South Korean outbreak earlier this year [2015].

They found that MERS-CoV viral RNA was detected on environmental surfaces up to 5 days after patients' respiratory samples tested positive for the virus by polymerase chain reaction. The RNA was detected in samples from anterooms, medical devices, and air-ventilating equipment. As well, the virus itself was isolated from bed sheets, bed rails, intravenous fluid hangers, and x-ray equipment.

The researchers were also able to isolate viable virus from 3 of the patients from 18 to 25 days after symptom onset.

Conclusions
-----------
Most of the touchable surfaces in MERS units were contaminated by patients and health care workers and the viable virus could shed through respiratory secretion from clinically fully recovered patients. These results emphasize the need for strict environmental surface hygiene practices, and sufficient isolation period based on laboratory results, rather than solely on clinical symptoms.

Although this study was conducted in S Korea, virus-contaminated surfaces may also explain the high proportion of cases in Saudi Arabia in health care workers (12 per cent of the total), patients in health care settings (33 per cent of the total), and possibly also household contacts (14 per cent).
