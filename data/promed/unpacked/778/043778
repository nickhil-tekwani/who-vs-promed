News of the response
The voice of the community
--------------------------
The community dialogue initiated by the coordination of the response to Ebola treatment attacks in late February [2019] has allowed community members to make their voices heard in the pursuit of the response against Ebola at home.

- In general, the 3 main objectives achieved in these community dialogues were to discuss social and development issues of importance to communities, the establishment of local response committees, and the signing of a contract of trust. between communities and response teams. Some of the communities' concerns can be realized in the immediate future while others will require more in-depth consultations with the technical and financial partners for their implementation.

- The communities demanded that the Government and international partners also invest in improving the overall living conditions of the population by thinking, in particular, of improving sanitation facilities, increasing access to drinking water, improve the road network, create jobs for young people and build modern public markets.

- In addition, the establishment of local response committees has already begun in several neighborhoods. These committees allowed the community to own and feel responsible for the success of the response activities in their neighborhood.

- Finally, trust contracts were established between the community and the actors of the response in neighborhoods where the greatest number of attacks had been recorded. By signing this contract of trust, the communities commit themselves to facilitate the work of the teams of the response and to guarantee their safety when they carry out actions in their district. In return, the response teams are committed to always listening to communities and ensuring that response interventions respect community desires and local customs. Following the signing of these trust contracts in several districts of Butembo, the coordination agreed to reduce the use of law enforcement to secure the movement of the agents of the response, to bring the transit center closer to them and set up dignified and safe burial teams composed of influential young people from neighborhoods.

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 29 Mar 2019:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 1069 , of which 1003 are confirmed and 66 are probable. In total, there were 665 deaths (599 confirmed and 66 probable) and 329 people cured.
- 293 suspected cases under investigation;
- 10 new confirmed cases, including 3 in Vuhovi, 2 in Mandima, 2 in Katwa, 1 in Oicha, 1 in Mambasa and 1 in Beni; New health zone potentially affected: a girl living in Mandima (Biakato Mine) was detected as a confirmed case in Mambasa (Ituri). It seems that she went there after getting sick to be cared for where her parents live. Further investigations will determine whether the case should be reclassified to Mandima.
- 5 new deaths of confirmed cases, including 2 community deaths, including 1 in Katwa and 1 in Vuhovi; 3 deaths at CTE, including 2 in Butembo and 1 in Beni;
- 4 new cured patients, 2 of whom were from the Butembo CTE and 2 from the CTE of Beni.

News of the response
Reopening of the Katwa Ebola Treatment Center
---------------------------------------------
- The Ebola Treatment Center in Katwa has been officially reopened since Sat 30 Mar 2019. After the attacks of the 2 CTEs in Butembo town in late February [2019], a general feeling of fear had invaded both the communities and the response teams. The coordination then initiated community dialogues to listen to the community and rebuild trust so that the communities would accept the interventions of the response (CTE referencing, household decontamination, vaccination, dignified and secure burials, etc.).

- Following the new wave of positive cases from Masereka, Katwa and Vuhovi since mid-March [2019], the Butembo CTE was full and the reconstruction of the Katwa CTE was becoming a real priority. Thus, in consultation with the district leaders of Vighole, Rughenda and Katwa, the communication teams of the response and the socio-anthropologists worked on a plan to rebuild the CTE that would promote the ownership of the CTE by the community.

- Neighborhood leaders were pleased with this initiative because the women in the community were concerned about the future of Ebola-infected patients in the community in the absence of an appropriate care structure for their care.

- Socio-anthropologists have played an important role in defining the practical modalities for rebuilding the CTE and ensuring community ownership. They recommended that neighborhood leaders organize community meetings to ensure transparency in the recruitment of local workers. Then they asked that the traditional chiefs carry out rituals of appeasement of spirits in the presence of the district chiefs and all the members of the community recruited before initiating the cleaning and reconstruction work of the CTE. It was also important to sensitize all workers and the community at large about the importance of seeing the CTE as a community property where all members of this community can entrust their patients so that the experts take care of them with respect.

- Management of the Katwa CTE is now provided by the Ministry of Health in collaboration with WHO and UNICEF. Dr. Richard Kitenge, national coordinator of CTE and country leader in the management of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), welcomed the rapid reopening of the Katwa CTE to relieve the congestion of the Butembo CTE. He recalled that the CTE is fully operationalized by local health workers and native Butembo territory. He invited the population to refer to the CTE as soon as possible any patient suspected of having Ebola to increase their chances of survival. According to patient data, 80% of patients (8 out of 10 patients) who were treated less than 3 days after onset of symptoms survived. This demonstrates the importance for people who have been in contact with Ebola patients to respect the 21-day follow-up period and to collaborate with community-based surveillance teams.

[2] Outbreak summaries
- Mon 1 Apr 2019. DRC ends March with ongoing surge of Ebola cases [CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/04/drc-ends-march-ongoing-surge-ebola-cases

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) closed out March [2019] --its toughest month so far in the ongoing Ebola outbreak-- with an ongoing spate of cases over the weekend: 23 in 8 locations.

As the outbreak turned the page to a new month today [Mon 1 Apr 2019], the World Health Organization's (WHO's) online Ebola dashboard puts the outbreak total at 1089 cases, which likely reflect 7 more new cases. [WHO dashboard: https://who.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/f9003796864241b99d21474025f3667e Ebola surveillance dashboard for 31 Mar 2019, an interactive display of confirmed and probable cases, number of contacts followed, deaths, survivors, and more.]

The surge in March [2019] cases followed attacks on Ebola treatment centers in Katwa and Butembo in late February [2019], which temporarily slowed key response activities such as case finding and contact tracing. All told, the DRC reported 194 new cases and 119 deaths in March [2019], the busiest month of the outbreak, which began in August 2018.

In a new development, the health ministry announced on [Sat 30 Mar 2019] that the Ebola treatment center in Katwa, one of the outbreak's main hot spots, has reopened.

And yesterday [Sun 31 Mar 2019] people in Beni and Butembo voted in national general elections that were supposed to happen in late December [2018] but were delayed because of Ebola activity. The delay had sparked suspicion that Ebola was being used as a political tool, but voting proceeded smoothly in parts of Beni where unrest and armed militias have often been reported, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported yesterday [Sun 31 Mar 2019].

Cases span range of hot spots
-----------------------------
Of the 23 new cases reported over the weekend, 7 were Katwa, 6 were from Vuhovi, 4 in Mandima, and 2 in Beni. Four locations each had a single case: Oicha, Mambasa, Masereka, and Musienene.

The case in Mambasa, which would have been a 1st for that health zone in Ituri province, was reclassified as a case from Mandima after investigators found that the girl became ill there before she sought care in Mambasa where her parents live, the health ministry said in its [31 Mar 2019] update.

The newly confirmed infections lifted the overall case total to 1082, which included 1016 confirmed and 66 probable cases. Investigations are still under way into 279 suspected Ebola infections.

Of 16 new deaths reported over the weekend, 10 people died in community settings, which is known to increase the risk of virus spread. The community deaths occurred in Katwa, Vuhovi, Mandima, and Masereka. Six patients died in Ebola treatment centers, 4 in Butembo and 2 in Beni. The new developments raise the outbreak's fatality count to 676.

- Fri 29 Mar 2019 DRC Ebola total grows by 15; new antiviral clears hurdle [CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/03/drc-ebola-total-grows-15-new-antiviral-clears-hurdle
[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

An ongoing surge of Ebola cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) saw another double-digit rise today [Fri 29 Mar 2019], with 15 new cases, the health ministry said in its daily update.

In other developments, a US research team announced yesterday [Thu 28 Mar 2019] it has received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance to use animal models in its development of remdesivir, one of the experimental treatments being used to treat patients in the DRC outbreak.

Infections push total to 1059 [now 1089]
----------------------------------------
All of the 15 newly confirmed cases are from the main epicenters and other smaller hot spots that have recently reported cases; 5 are in Vuhovi and 4 in Katwa, and 3 locations each have 2 cases: Mandima, Oicha, and Beni.

The infections boost the country's overall case total to 1059, including 993 confirmed and 66 probable cases. Yesterday [Thu 28 Mar 2019] the DRC confirmed 14 cases, so today's [Fri 29 Mar 2019] numbers make it the largest 2-day increase in the history of the outbreak.

Health officials are also investigating 225 suspected Ebola cases.

Also, 8 more people died from their infections, 4 of them in community settings--3 in Katwa and 1 in Vuhovi. Deaths that occur in the community are a concern, because viral levels are highest during the severe stages of illness and at death, raising the risk of further spread in settings where people aren't wearing personal protective equipment.

The other 4 fatalities occurred in Ebola treatment centers, including 2 in Butembo and 2 in Beni. The outbreak has now claimed 660 lives.

Remdesivir benefits from FDA Animal Rule
----------------------------------------
The US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) said yesterday [Thu 28 Mar 2019] that for the 1st time the FDA has allowed the use of the Animal Rule for developing a drug treatment for Ebola. Remdesivir, an antiviral known as GS-5734, is one of 4 experimental treatments authorized for compassionate use in the DRC's Ebola treatment centers, where clinical trials are under way for 3 of the treatments, including remdesivir.

In a news release, USAMRIID said a 2018 Ebola natural history study that it conducted in collaboration with Gilead Sciences, the drug's sponsor, paved the way for the Animal Rule agreement. The Geneva Foundation is another collaborator, and the work was funded by the Joint Project Manager for Medical Countermeasure Systems, part of the US Department of Defense Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense.

The FDA agreed that using rhesus macaques infected by intramuscular injection is a relevant and adequately characterized model of Ebola infection to support filing under the FDA Animal Rule, designed to apply to the drug approval process when human efficacy trials are not feasible or ethical.

As part of the agreement, the FDA said the rhesus monkey model is sufficient as a single-animal model for drug development and that a specific delayed time-to-treat approach is appropriate for future nonclinical studies to assess remdesivir's efficacy.

Col Gary Weaver, USAMRIID commander, said that, over the years, Ebola countermeasures have been subject to regulatory uncertainties regarding which models, if any, would be acceptable to the FDA for evaluating efficacy under the Animal Rule.

"The study design and data-quality posture USAMRIID adopted for the Ebola virus NHS sets a precedent that has the potential to be useful for medical countermeasure development efforts targeting other similar human pathogens, such as Marburg or Sudan viruses," he said.

Congo Ebola outbreak spreading faster than ever: WHO
----------------------------------------------------
Democratic Republic of Congo's Ebola outbreak is spreading at its fastest rate yet, 8 months after it was first detected, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on [Mon1 Apr 2019].

Each of the past 2 weeks has registered a record number of new cases, marking a sharp setback for efforts to respond to the 2nd biggest outbreak ever, as militia violence and community resistance have impeded access to affected areas.

Less than 3 weeks ago, the WHO said the outbreak of the hemorrhagic fever was largely contained and could be stopped by September [2019], noting that weekly case numbers had halved from earlier in the year to about 25.

But the number of cases hit a record 57 the following week, and then jumped to 72 last week, said WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier. Previous spikes of around 50 cases per week were documented in late January [2019] and mid-November [2018].

More alarmingly, about half of Ebola deaths last week occurred outside of treatment centers, according to Congo health ministry data, meaning there is a much greater chance they transmitted the virus to those around them. "People are becoming infected without access to response measures," Lindmeier told Reuters.

Lindmeier said new approaches to community outreach were showing signs of progress and that some previously hostile local residents had recently agreed to grant health workers access.
