Occurrence of Potato Powdery Scab Caused by _Spongospora subterranea_
f. sp. _subterranea_ in Costa Rica.
M. Montero-Astua and V.Vasquez, Centro de Investigacion en Biolog√≠a
Celular y Molecular (CIBCM), Universidad de Costa Rica (UCR); and C.
Rivera, CIBCM and Facultad de Microbiologia, UCR. Plant Dis. 86:1273,
2002; published on-line as D-2002-0826-01N, 2002. Accepted for
publication 12 Aug 2002.
Powdery scab of potatoes, caused by _Spongospora subterranea_
(Wallr.) Lagerheim f. sp. subterranea_ Tomlinson [Ss], is important
worldwide because of its effect on tuber quality and as the vector of
Potato mop-top pomovirus. Scab-like lesions have been observed on
potato in Costa Rica (1), but the presence of the pathogen remained
unconfirmed.
In 2001, powdery scab was observed in a field and a greenhouse in the
high elevation zone of the main potato-producing area of Costa Rica
and on commercial potatoes obtained at a farmers' market.
The presence of spore balls or cystosori with a honey-comb-like
structure under light microscopy confirmed the identity of _S.
subterranea_. Its identity was also confirmed by ELISA using
monoclonal antibodies specific for Ss (BioReba Ag, Reinach,
Switzerland).
Pathogenicity of Ss was confirmed by bioassay on tomato plants grown
in nutrient solution culture (2). Tomato (_Lycopersicon esculenta_)
cv. Supermarmande were grown from seed in pots filled with quartz and
watered with nutrient solution. After 3 weeks, the roots were trimmed
to 60 mm, and plants were transferred to a nutrient solution for
further growth.
After 1 week, tomato seedlings were inoculated by replacing the
nutrient solution with nutrient solution containing cystosori (20
mg/liter, wt/vol). Zoosporangia of Ss were observed in root hairs and
epidermal cells of seedlings 2 weeks after inoculation.
To our knowledge, this is the first report that confirms the presence
of Ss on potato in Costa Rica.

[Surprisingly, this appears to be the first report of Ss as a potato
pathogen _per se_ in ProMED-mail. It has been previously reported in
relation to its role as the vector of Potato mop-top pomovirus. Ss
infects potato tubers, causing lesions and cankers, which depresses
the market value of the crop and is an impediment to international
trade in seed potatoes. Masses of spores (spore balls or cystosori)
enable the fungus to remain viable for more than 10 years in cool
temperature regions. Ss is worldwide in distribution and is
particularly serious in Europe.
An excellent source of current information of the pathogen and the
disease in Europe is available at the following URL:
