Thailand: Dove-eaters Hospitalized with Bird-flu Symptoms
-----------------------------------------------
Two Thai men have been hospitalized after showing symptoms similar to
bird flu following consumption of wildfowl in Uttaradit, one of 7
provinces in the country's "red zone" for the animal pandemic,
reports said on Sun 23 Jul 2006.

Uttaradit chief medical officer Boonriang Chuchaisaengrat said
further tests were needed to establish whether an unidentified
67-year-old man and his 35-year-old son-in-law had contracted avian
influenza or not, reported the Thai News Agency. The 2 men had
reportedly developed flu-like symptoms after eating a wild bird,
believed to be a spotted dove, in Uttaradit.

Uttaradit is one of 7 central and northern provinces that were
recently classified as a "red zone" for avian influenza, although
agriculture and health authorities have thus far denied any confirmed
cases of a reappearance of the animal pandemic in the area [see the
ProMED-mail references below. - Mod.CP].

There have been news reports of mysterious mass deaths of poultry in
the provinces. Bird flu was 1st confirmed in Thailand in late 2003,
after months of what was deemed a government cover-up of outbreaks in
the country's massive commercial poultry industry, once a major
export earner. Thailand has claimed to be bird flu free for most of
this year [2006], and if its status is confirmed without further
outbreaks, the country may soon resume exports of uncooked chicken meat.

Since bird flu was 1st detected in the kingdom, there have been 19
confirmed cases of the H5N1 virus among humans, 13 of whom have died
[22 confirmed cases and 14 deaths according to the latest WHO figures; see
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2006_07_20/en/index.html>
- Mod.CP]. The last confirmed case of a
human infection with H5N1 avian influenza was a 7-year-old boy from
Kanchanaburi Province who developed symptoms on 16 Oct 2005 and was
hospitalized on 19 Oct 2005. He recovered.

[This report increases the number of suspected cases of avian
influenza virus infection in Thailand to 7: Two sisters aged 3 and 4,
2 adult males aged 59 and 86, and a 7-year old boy, all in the
northern province of Phichit, as well as the 2 adult males aged 35
and 67 resident in the province of Uttaradit described in the above
report. Both provinces are located in the "red zone" for high poultry
disease risk.

It is unclear whether any of these 7 suspected human cases have been
diagnosed on the basis of local laboratory testing or merely on the
basis of symptomology. It seems unlikely in the Uttaradit incident
that infection would have been contracted from consumption of a wild
bird, providing it had been adequately cooked. Further information is awaited.
