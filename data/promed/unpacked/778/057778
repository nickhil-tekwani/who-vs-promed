While 31 elephants in Nepal are infected with tuberculosis (TB), only 19
are receiving treatment. According to the Chitwan National Park, there is a
possibility that more elephants could contract the disease, as many
infected elephants have not received any treatment.

Information released by the Department of Wildlife states that there are
more than 200 elephants in Nepal. These elephants are either conserved by
the state or are privately-owned. The TB-infected elephants owned privately
by hotels in Sauraha are not receiving treatment due to the lack of
appropriate funds on the part of the hotels.

Dr Jeevan Thapa, a veterinarian treating the elephants, says that it is
impossible to control the spread of the disease unless all elephants are
treated. Hoteliers in Sauraha say they are willing to treat the elephants
only if they receive aid. Another vet, Dr Kamal Gaire, says talks to this
effect with the hoteliers are underway, and treatment for elephants is to
begin mid-June 2009 with the help of donor agencies.

At present, 10 elephants owned by various hotels inside the Chitwan
National Park, 6 government-owned elephants in the National Park, 3 in the
National Nature Conservation Trust, 2 in Bardiya National Park, one in
Suklaphanta Wildlife Reserve, one in Parsa Wildlife Reserve, and 8
elephants owned by hoteliers of Sauraha have TB.

Among those infected, 19 are being treated and have been kept separately at
the Chitwan National Park. Those treating the elephants say the animals'
condition is improving. Doctors say that the treatment of each elephant
costs Rs 300 000 [USD 6054]. Even the Chitwan National Park, citing lack of
funds, hadn't treated the elephants for over a year, even though they were
diagnosed with TB. The treatment for elephants at the Chitwan National Park
has been possible with aid from Elephant Care International, a US
organization. Two doctors from the Agriculture Campus, one from the Chitwan
National Park, and 2 other technicians are involved in the treatment.

The disease was diagnosed in 2001, but it spread among many elephants,
since treatment procedures were not introduced on time.

[Elephants are known to be susceptible to infection by both _Mycobacterium
tuberculosis_ and _M. bovis_. The above article does not specify the
bacteria identified in the Nepali elephants. A short review on tuberculosis
in elephants, by Susan Mikota, was published by ProMED-mail in July 2007
(see ProMED-mail archive 20070702.2111). It included, among other things,
the following: "While most cases in the US have been due to _M.
tuberculosis_, we may find more cases of _M. bovis_ in Asia, where
elephants often share grazing land with domestic livestock." The review, to
which subscribers are referred, also covered data on the sampling and
laboratory techniques applicable in elephants.

A brief history of elephant TB and a further description of serological
tests can be found in the summary document of a 2005 elephant TB research
meeting (Summary - Elephant Tuberculosis Research Workshop May 2005, 26
pages, available at
<http://www.elephantcare.org/protodoc_files/2005/Elephant%20Tuberculosis%20Research%20Workshop%20May%2005.pdf>).
