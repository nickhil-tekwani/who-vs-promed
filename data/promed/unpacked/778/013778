Suspected FMD killing cows in Sungai Siput
-----------------------------------------------
A cattle owner who won recognition as a successful livestock breeder
last year [2005] is a dejected man these days. In the last 3 weeks,
12 of his calves and 7 cows have died from suspected foot and mouth
disease (FMD). 6 other cows are also showing signs of being infected.
"I used to spend a lot of time at the farm, but now I seldom go
there, as I feel very sad," said the man, who took over his family
business of rearing dairy cows 5 years ago. He is contemplating how
best to save his farm, as 2 of the animals lie dead, suspected to be
victims of FMD.
His farm has 100 head of Friesian cows imported from Australia at RM
4000 [USD 1059] per head.
Several other livestock breeders here and in Ipoh also complained
that their calves had died over the last 3 weeks.
State veterinary officer Dr. Wan Mohd Kamil Wan Nik said the FMD
situation was under control. He said his officers had vaccinated over
20 000 cows in 4 districts, namely Batang Padang, Kinta, Kuala
Kangsar, Larut Matang and Selama in November 2005. He urged farmers
to contact the department immediately if their cows or calves die so
that a post mortem can be conducted to determine the cause of death.

[FMD is endemic in Malaysia (Peninsular); see moderator's comment in
20051214.3592. Sungai Siput is a small town in the district of Kuala
Kangsar, about 30 km north of the state capital Ipoh, in Perak State
(Latitude 4.7500, Longitude 101.0667). The North-South Highway
bypasses the town. For map, see
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/MY/7/Sungai_Siput2.html>.
FMD is known for its potential to cause high mortality in young
animals (calves, lambs, kids, piglets). Although disease symptoms in
(unvaccinated) older animals might be serious, followed by severe
economical losses, mortality is less common. The most common
complication in dairy cattle is mastitis, leading to culling. Timely
vaccinations with effective vaccines and meticulous biosecurity
measures will significantly reduce or even eliminate losses in
endemic regions.
Laboratory tests of samples from affected (vaccinated) animals are
essential in order to exclude other diseases or the involvement of
FMD serotypes which are not included in the vaccine. - Mod.AS]
