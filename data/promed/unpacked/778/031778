[1] Cholera - Afghanistan

A total of 28 deaths from cholera and/or acute watery diarrhea (AWD)
have been reported in Afghanistan in the past 2 months, the Ministry of
Public Health (MoPH) has said. At least 673 cases of AWD and/or cholera
had been reported in 11 of the country's 34 provinces, it said.

According to the WHO, cholera is rarely reported in Afghanistan. Health
officials in the northern province of Samangan have called for
emergency assistance to thwart a possible cholera outbreak in
Dara-e-Sof District. "Over the past 3 days cholera has killed 5 people
in Dara-e-Sof. Unless preventive measures are implemented urgently it
could spread to other areas," said Abdul Hameed, director of Samangan's
health department.

The disease has also been reported in the eastern province of Nangarhar
where flash floods affected about 4000 people on 31 Aug 2009, the UN
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported on
2 Sep 2009.

Singapore has seen a 50 percent increase in diarrhea cases at local
polyclinics in the past week, local media reported on Thu 10 Sep 2009.
The country's 18 polyclinics, which are government-owned clinics,
treated 2990 patients for acute diarrhea last week [week of 1 Sep
2009], or about 50 percent more than the weekly average of 2072 cases,
local newspaper the Straits Times reported.

When polyclinics see more than 2668 cases a week, it is considered an
epidemic. The last time such an outbreak happened was 2 years ago.
Doctors who have seen many more cases than usual in the last 2 weeks,
said it appears to be highly contagious.

[4] Cholera - Kenya
Date: Thu 10 Sep 2009

report [edited]

"About 13 people are reported to have died of cholera in Turkana [in
the northwest] since 20 Aug [2009]," Shahnaaz Sharif, the director of
public health, told IRIN, adding that 5 of the deaths occurred in
hospital while the rest have been reported by villagers. New cases are
being reported in the Turkana divisions of Kalokol and Kerio, Sharif
said. "The worry is [that] they [Turkana residents] are using water
from the Ferguson Gulf, in Lake Turkana, which is contaminated," he
said. A broken-down water pump has been repaired to provide clean
water. The area also has low latrine cover, contributing to improper
waste disposal.

In the capital Nairobi, 3 cholera cases were reported in the eastern
Dandora area 7 days ago. "This was caused by the use of water from a
well that was sunk close to a latrine," he said. Dysentery cases are
also being reported 250 km [155 miles] from the northeastern Laisamis
area, where a previous cholera outbreak was reported.

So far, more than 600 cholera cases have been reported in the affected
Turkana divisions, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) health
coordinator for Kenya, Vincent Kahi, told IRIN. "Lack of water for
Kalokol, Turkana, is the main driver of the disease," Kahi said. He
said NGO [non-governmental agency] partners, with the Health Ministry,
were distributing chlorine for water treatment and repairing
infrastructure.

The IRC is helping to provide medicine and staff to help in the early
diagnosis of the disease. The Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS) is
supporting water and sanitation projects in drought-hit northeastern
Ijara and Isiolo in the east to reduce the vulnerability of pastoralist
communities to recurrent droughts. KRCS staff and volunteers are also
training community members in hygiene and are continuing to distribute
relief aid to 573 343 beneficiaries in the region.

[5] Diarrhea - Congo DR (North Kivu)
Date: Wed 16 Sep 2009

A mysterious illness has struck the Walikale territory for the last 3
months. The symptoms of this disease include diarrhea and vomiting. The
tribal chief Lukong Birunga of Waloa Yungu told Radiookapi.net that the
illness first manifested in his group Waloa Yungu before reaching 5
localities of North Kivu province, namely Buhimba, Kimuwa, Nando,
Mikweti, Kahilenge-Mitwa. The same source said that during 3 months, 26
deaths were recorded including the case on [Mon 14 Sep 2009].

Also according to the same source, patients have no access to medical
care, because there is no functional health facility on site. Health
officials in Goma already have the information, says the source, but
cannot go there to intervene because of the bad security situation. The
traditional authority recalls that the Waloa Yungu group in the
territory of Walikale in North Kivu is so far experiencing armed groups
and foreign forces who are the law there.
