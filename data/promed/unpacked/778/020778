The Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington D.C. has experienced an outbreak
of duck viral enteritis in its collection ducks and wild ducks found in the
park. Most of the 20 fatalities have been wild wood ducks.
Gross lesions were initially vague or non-existent. Days later, birds
began to show white spots in the liver and, occasionally, thickened Peyer's
patches. Histologically, there was hepatic necrosis with intranuclear
inclusion bodies in the hepatocytes. DVE was confirmed at the Cornell
University Duck Research Laboratory by PCR. Zoo collection animals that
have been affected include an Australian shelduck, a gadwall, a Bahama
pintail, and a Barrow's goldeneye. The last fatality occurred on 27 May 2005.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Viner for this first hand report on
the outbreak of duck viral enteritis at the Smithsonian National Zoo in

[Duck Viral Enteritis is also known as duck plague. The following from the
Merck Manual
<http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/200900.htm>
"Duck viral enteritis is an acute, highly contagious disease of ducks,
geese, and swans of all ages, characterized by sudden death, high mortality
(particularly among older ducks), and hemorrhages and necrosis in internal
organs. It has been reported in domestic and wild waterfowl in Europe,
Asia, North America, and Africa. Economic losses on domestic duck farms
have been limited to serious, and sporadic die-offs in wild waterfowl have
been limited to massive.
There is no treatment. Prevention is based on maintaining susceptible birds
in a disease-free environment. Contact with wild, free-flying waterfowl and
direct or indirect contact with contaminated birds or material
(free-flowing water) should be avoided. Control is effected by
depopulation, removal of birds from the infected environment, sanitation,
and disinfection. A chicken-embryo-adapted, modified live virus vaccine has
been approved for use in domestic ducks, in zoological aviaries, and by
private aviculturists. A 0.5-mL dose is administered SC or IM to domestic
ducklings >2 wk old, with a booster inoculation 1 yr later. The vaccine is
not approved for use in wild ducks." - Mod.TG]
