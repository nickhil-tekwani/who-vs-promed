[Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtype H5N1 continues to spread in West Africa (see ProMED-mail archive list below). Therefore, it should not be surprising that the disease has now been reported in Cote d'Ivoire.

Given the fairly recent historical events associated with HPAI in West Africa during 2006-2007, establishing cooperative efforts between the affected countries in the area aimed at reducing the spread of the disease should be a priority.

In 2006, 5 HPAI outbreaks were reported in Cote d'Ivoire; H5N1 was the subtype identified in all the cases. The outbreaks were located in the provinces of Abidjan (4) and San Pedro (1). See final report at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000005135_20070327_171750.pdf.
