Ebola Virus Disease, Sierra Leone
---------------------------------
From the Ministry of Health and Sanitation [Sierra Leone]

Ebola outbreak update: As of today, [1 Aug 2014], we have 140 cumulative number of survivors, 526 confirmed Ebola cases and 189 Ebola confirmed deaths. 70 patients are currently admitted at the Ebola treatment centers in Kenema and Kailahun.

The Heads of State and Government of Member States of the Mano River Union (Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Cote d'Ivoire) and their development partners, including the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Margaret Chan, met in Conakry today [1 Aug 2014] to review the status of the Ebola epidemic and adopt common strategies to eradicate Ebola from their respective countries and the sub-region.

The meeting, which is organized by the Mano River Union Secretariat, started yesterday [31 Jul 2014] with the Technical session of heads and technical folks from the 4 countries and their development partners dealing in the health sector. The technical meeting was followed by a meeting of Ministers of Health from the 4 countries, which ran into the early hours of today [1 Aug 2014], to begin the preliminary work on the communique.

Some of the measures to be adopted by the member countries as stated in the communique include the following:
1. We, the Heads of State and Governments of the Mano River Union, commit to take actions to stop the Ebola outbreak in our Member States. We would like to express our appreciation to all our health personnel and experts in our respective countries who have been supporting us in the fight against Ebola.
2. We have agreed to take important and extraordinary actions at the inter country level to focus on cross-border regions that have more than 70 percent of the epidemic. These areas will be isolated by police and the military. The people in these areas being isolated will be provided with material support. The health care services in these zones will be strengthened for treatment, testing and contact tracing to be done effectively. Burials will be done in accordance with national health regulations.
3. We agree to provide our health personnel incentives, treatment and protection so they could come back to work. We shall ensure the security and safety of all national and international personnel supporting the fight against Ebola.
4. Member States may consider restriction of movement and prohibiting mass gathering as appropriate.
5. Ebola is an international problem that requires an international response. Accordingly, we the Heads of State commit to do our part to bring the Ebola outbreak to an end as soon as possible. To this end, the International Community shall support Member States to build capacity for surveillance, contact tracing, case management and laboratory capacity.
6. We the Heads of State want to assure the international community that the disease is not being exported. We assure the International Community that we have instituted measures at international ports of entry. Line listed contacts and people under surveillance will be listed and the information will be provided to each Member State so the people will not be able to travel outside of their respective countries until surveillance has been lifted.
7. We also appreciate the support of international organizations and NGOs, but as that they work within the framework of our national plans. Communication shall be transparent and coordinated using the structures that have been established within each Member State. We the Member States shall be transparent in how we use your resources to achieve results and we request that all partners shall be transparent and accountable.

In her address, the Director General of WHO Margaret Chan registered her organization's commitment to supporting the implementation of measures that have been developed and agreed upon together by Heads of State of Member Countries. She asked all partners and the International Community to pull their resources, whether human, technical or financial, to assist the Member States in implementing the plan. The communique is also clear on activities that are expected to be undertaken by partners and those to be jointly done by member countries. The communique was read out by the Secretary General of Mano River Union, Hadja Dr. Saran Daraba Kaba.
