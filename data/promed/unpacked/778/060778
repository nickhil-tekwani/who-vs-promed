[In early April we posted two communications concerning the differencial
diagnosis of CD and nvCJD in relation to the recent death of Dr
Fishler-Fisk's mother. On Sunday she posted the following communication.
AHEAD-Mod MHJ]
Rachel posts:
"It seems to me that in distinguishing between nvCJD and sporadic CJD we are
relying on differences in EEGs (classical vs non-classical). If this is so,
is the distinction clear enough for a non-invasive nvCJD diagnosis in living
patients? Perhaps EEGs could be used for early diagnoses in potentially
treatable patients?"
According to the literature, some 20% of classic CJD cases have an atypical EEG.
We have finally got the autopsy results on my mother. She had an atypical
EEG. Spoingiform changes were present, but no kuru type plaques were found.
So - based on the lack of kuru type plaques, it was CJD not nvCJD. Since,
with the exception of age, she met the clinical symptoms of nvCJD and her
personal history included trips to England, the only conclusive distinction
between classic CJD and nvCJD in this case was through the autopsy results.
In this case EEG was not conclusively diagnostic for classic CJD vs. nvCJD.
This only reinforces the necessity for autopsy in all cases of CJD or
suspected CJD. A positive 14-3-3 protein test for CJD, which does require a
spinal tap, but is minimally invasive compared to a biopsy and which is
supposedly 99% accurate and was positive in my mother's case, could
eliminate the need for any brain biopsy as long as an autospy was assured.
It seems to me that once a test with 99% accuracy for CJD in general has
come up positive, distinguishing between classic CJD and nvCJD can await the
autopsy, as long as there is one.
