Ship-owners: sheep in good health
--------------------------------
Sheep aboard the Dutch livestock transport ship Cormo Express stuck
in the Persian Gulf had been provided with extra food and water and
were in relatively good condition, the Dutch ship owners said.
But Cor Radings, spokesman for Vroon BV, said the problem still
needed to be solved urgently; he added that the ship was now in open
seas off the United Arab Emirates where conditions were cooler.
"They (the sheep) are in a relatively good health at this moment. We
have brought in extra food supplies. We have brought in extra water.
There is maximum ventilation on board," he told ABC Radio. "We have
brought in extra crew to look after the ship. So they are in a
relatively good condition and even gaining weight. Since the vessel
left Fremantle on 5 Aug 2003, 3770 sheep have died and that is the
latest number we have given out. We can say it has steadied down a
bit although in the long term we need an urgent solution to this
problem."
Up to 57 000 sheep have been aboard MV Cormo Express for the last 7
weeks with Saudi Arabia and 2 other countries rejecting the shipment
on grounds they have scabby mouth disease, which resembles the early
stages of Rift Valley fever.
Mr Radings said Vroon BV had no direct influence on the situation.
"We are not the cargo owners," he said. "So we can only depend on the
discussions that are going on between the cargo owner and the
receivers. There is also diplomatic discussion going on to resolve
this matter. The cargo owner would like to have the sheep on land
sooner than later. But he cannot do anything on his own so he needs
the assistance of other parties involved. We would like to see that
happen very soon which is in the best interests of the animals."

[On 26 Aug 2003, it was published that Saudi Arabia's quarantine
officials at the Port of Jeddah said that about 6 percent of the
animals in the shipment were affected by scabby mouth, exceeding the
5 percent tolerance level agreed between Saudi Arabia and Australia.
An Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) approved
veterinarian on board the MV Cormo Express, said that fewer than 200
sheep, or 0.35 per cent of the shipment, were affected. Since then
this consignment of sheep, intended for slaughter, has remained on
board of the vessel.
Scabby mouth is an Australian common name for Contagious Ecthyma of
sheep and goats, or Orf, an infectious dermatitis of sheep and goats
that affects primarily the lips of young animals. Other names in the
literature are Contagious pustular dermatitis and Sore mouth. Orf is
a parapoxvirus infection found worldwide, most common in late summer,
fall, and winter on pasture, and in winter in feedlots. It is a
self-limiting disease, not included in international lists of
reportable diseases. The proliferative lesions may occasionally occur
on the teats and, more seldom on the coronary bands of the feet of
sheep and goats. During the course of the disease (1-4 wks), the
scabs drop off and the tissues heal without scarring. During active
stages of the infection, the more severely affected lambs fail to eat
normally and lose condition. Extensive lesions on the feet lead to
lameness. Mastitis may result in ewes with lesions on the udder. Man
is occasionally affected, the disease usually characterized by the
development of a single lesion on the hand, arm, or face.
Occasionally, several bumpy lesions are present, each measuring up to
3 cm. in diameter, persisting for 3-6 weeks, and regressing
spontaneously. Progression to generalized disease is considered rare.
The alleged resemblance of Orf lesions to Rift Valley fever needs
substantiation; comments from experienced subscribers will be
appreciated. - Mod.AS]
