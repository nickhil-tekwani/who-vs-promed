Indonesia: avian influenza patient has encephalitis
---------------------------------------------------
A 67 year old woman from Cisarua in Lembang, West Java tested positive for
bird flu on Wed 11 Oct 2006 and is likely to be the country's 1st victim to
suffer from brain inflammation due to the virus. The head of the West Java
Health Office, Yudi Prayudha, said on Wednesday that he had received
confirmation of the woman's tests through a text message from a staff
member of the Health Ministry's research and development laboratory in
Jakarta, who said the results were confirmed after the 3rd test. "[The
patient], a 67 year old female, is currently being treated at Hasan Sadikin
hospital in Bandung. The 3rd sample shows she is bird flu positive," Yudi
said, quoting the text message he received.
The woman's case is unique, as it is the 1st time in the country that the
H5N1 virus has been reported to have caused encephalitis, or inflammation
of the brain. A similar condition was reported to have caused the deaths of
2 siblings in south Viet Nam in 2004 [see: ProMED-mail post entitled: Avian
influenza, human (161): age-related severity 20061008.2888].
Yudi said that based on preliminary information from the hospital, the bird
flu patient has been placed in isolation after suffering a fever for 2 days
following the sudden death of her chickens. When she was 1st admitted to
the hospital Saturday afternoon [7 Oct 2006], she was in poor health,
suffering from a high fever, breathing problems and a loss of
consciousness. However, the hospital's team of doctors, led by Hadi Jusuf,
did not find indications that her loss of consciousness was due to acute
respiratory distress or pneumonia like other bird flu patients treated at
the hospital. "There's a strong indication that the virus has entered the
victim's brain membrane. A sample of fluid from her spinal cord has been
taken to confirm the nature of the virus," Yudi said.
Hadi Yusuf said the 1st test was negative but that the lab then conducted
the tests 5 times. The tests included serology tests as well as swabs from
her throat and lungs and cerebrospinal fluid from her spinal cord. "If the
tests show she is infected with H5N1, then this will be the 1st reported
avian influenza case that has caused brain inflammation in the country,"
Hadi told The Jakarta Post. He admitted, however, he had not received an
official report from the Health Ministry's laboratory.
Examinations by the hospital's neurology team, he said, has shown that the
patient is suffering from brain inflammation caused by a virus. The patient
was still in poor health on Wednesday [11 Oct 2006], although it seemed
like she had started regaining consciousness after briefly moving her hand.
Yudi asked people to remain calm about the latest bird flu development.
"It's very rare that H5N1 causes brain inflammation, so there's no need to
worry. Just follow instructions to prevent avian influenza infection," he said.
According to the Health Ministry, a total of 69 people have contracted bird
flu across the country. Of those, 52 have died. West Java has so far
recorded the highest number of fatalities. This patient is the province's
24th bird flu victim, of whom 17 have died.

[The 67 year old West Javan woman in the above report was described as a
confirmed human case of avian influenza virus infection in part 3 of Avian
influenza, human (163): Egypt, Indonesia 20061011.2913. Therefore, she
would rank as the 70th human case of avian influenza in Indonesia. However,
the WHO cumulative list of confirmed cases so far identifies only 69 cases
(as of 11 Oct 2006).
The above Jakarta Post report of 12 Oct 2006 is contradictory, stating that
the woman had tested positive, but that a subsequent sample from her spinal
fluid was virus-negative and that the results of additional tests were
awaited. Until the results of these additional tests have been obtained, it
cannot be assumed that the patient's encephalitis is a consequence of H5N1
avian influenza virus infection. Further information and clarification is
awaited. - Mod.CP]
