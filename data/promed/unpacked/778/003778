St. Louis encephalitis - USA (Florida) 970926232834]
According to a 30 September media report, a 68-year-old man from the Tampa
Bay area died from [St. Louis encephalitis] 25 September, the first
Floridian to die from the disease this year. The man died 12 days after
being hospitalized with headaches, confusion and a lack of coordination.
The mosquitoes that carry the virus feed after dark, and they are
particularly hungry at dusk [and dawn]. Just before the busy Labor Day
weekend, Walt Disney World and other Orlando attractions and hotels began
closing their water parks and pools before dusk, and schools in Brevard
County canceled Friday night football games.
Four people have contracted the mosquito-borne disease in the current
Florida outbreak. In the last major outbreak of encephalitis in Florida in
1990, 11 people died and 223 became sick.
