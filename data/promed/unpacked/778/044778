[Outbreaks of avian influenza, especially the H5N2 subtype, in ostriches have occurred previously in South Africa in 2004, 2006, and 2011. The Western Cape has been the setting for several outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in commercial ostrich farms in 2006 and 2011, while the Eastern Cape was the affected area in 2004. In both 2006 and 2011, there were outbreaks of H5N2 highly pathogenic avian influenza with 31 cases of H5N2 in the Western Cape in 2011.

Curiously, earlier this year an H7N1 subtype was identified in ostriches in the Western Cape, so with the addition now of a low pathogenic avian influenza, we begin to see a complex and highly interesting epidemiologic pattern in the ostriches of the Western Cape Province. - Mod.PC
