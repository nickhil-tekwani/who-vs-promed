MERS-CoV - update 23 Jun 2013
-----------------------------
The Ministry of Health (MoH) in Saudi Arabia has announced 2 additional laboratory-confirmed cases and a death in a previously confirmed case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

One case is a 41-year-old female from Riyadh who had contact with a confirmed case. The other case is a 32-year-old male from the Eastern Region with underlying medical conditions who is in critical condition.

In addition, the MoH has announced the death of a previously reported confirmed case from the Eastern Region who had been admitted to hospital on [26 Apr 2013] [according to the Arabic page of the Saudi MOH press release (in Arabic), this was an 81-year-old male (see http://www.moh.gov.sa/HealthAwareness/Corona/PressReleases/Pages/mediastatement-2013-06-21-001.aspx and prior ProMED-mail post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (33): Saudi Arabia, WHO, MOH, reporting challenges 20130622.1787065. - Mod.MPP]

Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 70 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 39 deaths.

WHO has received reports of laboratory-confirmed cases originating in the following countries in the Middle East to date: Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). France, Germany, Italy, Tunisia, and the United Kingdom also reported laboratory-confirmed cases; they were either transferred there for care of the disease or returned from the Middle East and subsequently became ill. In France, Italy, Tunisia, and the United Kingdom, there has been limited local transmission among patients who had not been to the Middle East but had been in close contact with the laboratory-confirmed or probable cases.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Healthcare providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. Specimens from patients' lower respiratory tracts should be obtained for diagnosis where possible. Clinicians are reminded that MERS-CoV infection should be considered even with atypical signs and symptoms, such as diarrhoea, in patients who are immunocompromised.

Healthcare facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Healthcare facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, healthcare workers and visitors.

All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

WHO continues to closely monitor the situation.

MOH announces recovery of contacts of novel coronavirus cases and one [death] in the Eastern Region
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Within the framework of the epidemiological surveillance of the novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the Ministry of Health (MOH) has announced that 4 cases of this virus have been recorded among people [with contact with] confirmed infected patients in Riyadh and the Eastern Region, ranging in ages between 7 and 15 [years]. It is noteworthy that the disease symptoms were not shown in their cases and their health condition is good.

Furthermore, MOH has announced that 2 cases of this virus have been recorded among female health workers in the Eastern Region and Al-Ahsa. Also, the disease symptoms were not shown in their cases [asymptomatic]. That is to be added to another 50-year-old female case recorded in the Eastern Region. Currently, she is hospitalized due to pulmonary disease but her health status is stable.

Thus, the total number of confirmed cases, who didn't show disease symptoms or completely recovered is 20.

The MOH has announced the death of one case, aged 32, in the Eastern Region, who had been previously announced to be infected with this virus and had been suffering from cancer.

[According to the Saudi MOH summary page on coronavirus (available at http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/HealthAwareness/Corona/Pages/AboutCorona.aspx), there are now 62 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 34 deaths in Saudi Arabia, representing an increase of 7 cases and one death since the previous ProMED-mail update (MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (33): Saudi Arabia, WHO, MOH, reporting challenges 20130622.1787065). The addition of these cases will also raise the global case count -- if the asymptomatic infections in case contacts are included in the global case count, it will raise the global total to 77 cases including 40 deaths.

[3] MERS-CoV: reporting recommendations
Date: Sat 22 Jun 2013
From: GM Stephens <gm_stephens@yahoo.com> [edited]


MERS-CoV challenges
-------------------
Recommendation for MERS-CoV posts: the test method should be included in all posts identifying cases. With the exception of Saudi Arabia's 1st case (September 2012), which was diagnosed by Dr Ali Zaki using classical viral culture methods, all subsequent cases have been diagnosed by experimental molecular amplification tests (PCR [polymerase chain reaction] or NAAT [nucleic acid amplification] tests). A handful have also been accompanied by positive virus isolations. Therefore posts announcing 'positive' and 'negative' cases, identified only by molecular testing, should be reported as 'PCR-positive' or 'PCR-negative'. It would also be helpful if the genomic target for the molecular test were included. Isolation of the MERS virus might also be included to reinforce the specificity of the molecular test in use. It is still the case that no clinical validation studies have been published on any commercially available molecular tests and it will take time for them to be cleared by regulatory authority. It is also true that molecular tests for MERS-CoV appear to have limitations very similar to what we in Canada experienced with SARS-CoV molecular tests, that is, low sensitivity and poor negative predictive values. This bias causes problems evaluating case rates which tend to be under-reported and fatality rates which are spuriously elevated. Once serologic reporting is available, cases that are 'seropositive' or 'seronegative' should be so identified. As many of these tests will be based on proprietary recombinant assays, readers should be informed that these are experimental assays unless validation details are included or otherwise published. During the SARS outbreak in Canada, classic, non-proprietary neutralization tests performed well, and eventually helped establish the accuracy of both recombinant serologic assays and molecular detection tests.

[4] MERS-CoV: reporting comments
Date: Sun 23 Jun 2013
From: Martin Haditsch <leonding@travelmed.at> [edited]


May I post a comment and a maybe provocative question?
As to my knowledge "infection" is defined as the proof of an infectious agent AND the proof of multiplication of this agent inside the body (OR associated inflammatory response that can be linked to this agent). Therefore my question is: where was the specimen taken from the "asymptomatic" nurses? PCR, as we all know, just detects nucleic acids. So if multiplication cannot be proven and no local or systemic inflammatory response is given, how was "contamination" (no matter whether due to inactivated parts of MERS-CoV or even complete virus particles) ruled out? This is not a semantic question only but should impact the reported number of "cases".

[There are many questions that remain on the epidemiology and clinical spectrum of infections with the MERS-CoV. It is not surprising that mild and/or asymptomatic infections have been identified, especially when one notes that the majority of cases have had very severe clinical presentations among individuals with pre-existing co-morbidities, suggesting that pre-existing co-morbidities predispose to serious infections. That being said, the possibility of laboratory contamination of specimens is always present. - Mod.MPP]

[5] MERS-CoV: pathogenesis hypothesis
Date: Sun 23 Jun 2013
From: Daniel Lucey <DRL23@Georgetown.edu> [edited]


Please consider posting on ProMED the following hypothesis regarding MERS pathogenesis and severity related to DPP4 dysregulation in diabetes mellitus.

Hypothesis: diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus that are characterized by dysregulation of DPP4 (CD26), a functional receptor for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), increase the risk of symptomatic infection and severe disease due to MERS-CoV. Medications that are DPP4 inhibitors and licensed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes may indirectly decrease the risk of symptomatic infection and severe disease due to MERS-CoV in diabetics, even though they do not directly block virus entry into cells expressing DPP4.

When Raj et al reported that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (CD26) is a functional receptor for the MERS-coronavirus they noted that DPP4 is a multifunctional transmembrane glycoprotein exopeptidase that regulates bioactivity of hormones and chemokines and "also has a major role in glucose metabolism by its degradation of incretins," as well as immunological modulation of chemotaxis, apoptosis, and T-cell activation (1). They went on to state, as did the accompanying editorial by Gallagher and Perlman (2), that discovery of DPP4 as a receptor for the MERS-CoV would likely play an important role in understanding the pathogenesis and epidemiology of MERS.

Some patients with MERS have been reported to have diabetes mellitus (3-6), and some have only been reported to have co-morbidities or underlying conditions not further specified. Most notable, however, was the publication this week reporting that 17/23 (74 percent) of MERS patients in the hospital outbreak(s) in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia had diabetes mellitus. From the information in the paper it could not be determined how many of the 15 fatalities, 2 patients still on mechanical ventilation, or 6 recovered patients, had diabetes (6).

Although neither diabetes mellitus as an underlying condition, nor its co-morbidities, are required for infection with the MERS-CoV, the hypothesis that the enhanced DPP4 activity in diabetes mellitus increases the risk of severe MERS-CoV infection warrants testing by:
1. Analyzing all patients with MERS for diabetes mellitus and comparing disease severity in patients with and without diabetes.
2. Analyzing all medication taken by patients with MERS, including DPP4 inhibitors and other therapies for diabetes mellitus.
3. Use of animal studies where, if a diabetic variant exists of a reported animal species in which pneumonia results from MERS-CoV infection such as the rhesus macaque (7), then increased virulence would be predicted compared to the non-diabetic animal.

In addition, animal species not found to be susceptible to MERS-CoV infection to date (hamsters, ferrets) might become susceptible in the setting of diabetes mellitus.

Lastly, if an effect of diabetes mellitus on MERS pathogenesis and severity is demonstrated, then it could be relevant that DPP4 has been reported to be an adipokine that might link obesity with type 2 diabetes (8) and obesity-associated inflammation (9).

[6] Correction: moderator comment, "reporting challenges"
Date: Mon 24 Jun 2013
From: Jake W Dunning <j.dunning@imperial.ac.uk> [edited]


In your ProMED-mail post entitled "Case count reporting challenges" (Sat 22 Jun 2013), you imply that the 8 retrospectively-diagnosed nCoV/MERS-CoV cases from the Jordan 2012 cluster (referred to in the cited, earlier ProMED post) were reported in an NEJM article. I don't think this is the case; as far as I am aware, there have only been media reports about these cases, following a Jordan MoH press statement last week [week of 17 Jun 2013].

My understanding is that the findings of the US CDC-Jordanian sero-study are yet to be published.

[This moderator would like to thank Dr Dunning for pointing out this error in ProMED-mail post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (33): Saudi Arabia, WHO, MOH, reporting challenges 20130622.1787065.

This moderator seems to have mixed apples and oranges from a lengthy prior post and erroneously attributed the information on additional retrospective case confirmations from the Jordan April 2012 outbreak to a NEJM article also presented in that same post. In fact, the information did come from a newswire interview with Dr Mohammad Al-Abdallat of the Ministry of Health, Jordan, announcing the results of a collaborative study by the Jordanian health ministry and scientists from the US Centers for Diseases Control [and Prevention] [CDC] in Atlanta.

This moderator sincerely apologizes for any inconveniences caused by this error and thanks Dr Dunning again for pointing this out. - Mod.MPP]
