The Veterinary Institute has detected the virus paramyxovirus type 1 which has led to an infectious disease among pigeons in Oslo. The institute, in collaboration with the Norwegian Food Safety Authority, has analyzed samples that confirm that the examined pigeons have been infected by the virus.

Paramyxovirus type 1 is an avian virus that is contagious to several bird species, but the extent to which they become ill varies. The virus is the same infectious agent that causes Newcastle disease infection, a very serious poultry disease. Those who have poultry or hobby birds themselves should avoid contact with sick and or dead pigeons.

Paramyxovirus-1 from birds does not cause disease in humans, but people who have accidentally been in close contact with sick or dead birds have in some cases contracted a short-term eye infection.

The Urban Environment Agency in Oslo, in consultation with the Norwegian Food Safety Authority, has advised against feeding urban pigeons, particularly in places where they are usually fed and where the birds come into close contact with other birds' excrements. The infection spreads easily where there are dense concentrations of pigeons.

If sick or dead birds are found where infectious disease can be suspected, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority must be contacted by e-mail at <postmottak@mattilsynet.no>, and the Norwegian Food Safety Authority will, in consultation with the Veterinary Institute, assess whether the bird should be sampled or not.

[Avian paramyxovirus 1 (APMV-1; Fam. Paramyxoviridae) is the etiologic agent of Newcastle disease (ND). APMV-1 strains maintained in pigeon populations have some antigenic differences from other APMV-1 isolates and are sometimes called pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1), which was first reported in racing pigeons in Italy in 1981, and then it became pandemic.

Several Newcastle disease outbreaks in chickens have been attributed to PPMV-1, which makes it a real threat to the poultry industry.

ND is found worldwide, but it has been currently controlled in Canada, the United States, and some western European countries. However, as the virus may circulate in wild birds, outbreaks may occur at any wildlife-livestock interface. - Mod.PMB
