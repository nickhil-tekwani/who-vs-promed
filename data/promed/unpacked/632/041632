Bucks County's largest bat population has met a grim fate. Scientists have confirmed that nearly all of the 10 000 bats that have hibernated in an abandoned iron ore mine in Upper Bucks for generations have died.

When Pennsylvania Game Commission Biologist Greg Turner recently visited the Durham mine for the 1st time in 2 years, he found total devastation.

The Durham bat mine was once the 2nd largest known bat habitat in Pennsylvania, but this winter only 23 were found alive. Of those, half had clear signs of infection.

Bucks County's bats were wiped out by a disease that has been killing bat colonies across the Northeast at an alarming rate in the last 4 years.

White nose syndrome is caused by a white fungus that forms around the nose of infected bats. They lose the body fat needed to survive hibernation and ultimately the mammals starve to death during the winter months.

During his visit to Durham's mine on 21 Feb 2013, biologist Turner found 3 different species of cave bats. Eighteen of the 23 bats were little brown bats. Of those, half of them were crowding at the entrance to the cave or had fungus on their muzzles; both are tell-tale signs of the fatal infection.

[The geographical distribution of WNS as of 29 Mar 2013 can be seen at http://whitenosesyndrome.org/resources/map.

One would have expected that after 6 years of the introduction of _Geomyces destructans_ in the North East of USA, local bat populations would slowly adapt, natural selection and acquired immunity would occur, and the populations would gradually recover (see ProMED post 20111222.3657). This new episode in the North East is really sad and discouraging.

Little brown bats (_Myotis lucifugus_) are beneficial to humans by feeding on mosquitoes and to agriculture by eating many species of agricultural pests. They also pollinate crops. - Mod.JW]
