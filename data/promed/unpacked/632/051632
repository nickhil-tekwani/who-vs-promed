Poison broth kills dozens in Ivory Coast
---------------------
Police in Ivory Coast [Cote d'Ivoire] say at least 25 people have died from
poisoning after eating contaminated corn broth. The broth is known locally
as baka. It seems to have been sold to villagers in the center of the
country, just south of the city Yammoussoukro [the capital]. The death toll
from the contaminated corn broth has been mounting for several days now.
Villagers in the affected area, in central Ivory Coast, are suffering from
violent vomiting and diarrhea after eating the food, which is traditionally
sold from house to house by women who make a modest living from cooking
meals. A paramilitary policeman in the region said it appears the woman
responsible for selling the corn broth did not know her wares were poisonous.
The woman has been taken into custody and may be charged with manslaughter.
But a police officer at the station where she is being held said that she
was also there for her own safety. Health workers in the region say
patients have overwhelmed the hospital nearest the affected villages, which
is in the city of Yammoussoukro, and the number of dead is likely to rise
in the coming days.

[This may be a traditional dish that uses corn as one of the vegetables or
as part of the thickening in this type of dish. Although this article does
not specify how long after consumption the clinical signs appear or how
long before death occurs, the effects described are difficult to attribute
to a toxin entirely associated with corn. Vomitoxin, a toxin in some
grains, not often associated with corn, does not usually result in death,
although it does produce vomiting, as the name suggests. However, this
article does not rule out bacterial toxins as contaminants from
preparation. - Mod.TG
It is probably a local beer. There are many types of local beer brewed on a
variety of items. Many years ago I experienced a brew in Botswana only
fermented for 24 hours, made from some local berries! It is a typical
income for women and a poison could be introduced in the brew if it was
brewed and transported in containers that that held something else. All
containers are reused in Africa, no matter whether they have contained oil
products, insecticides, or whatever. - Mod.EP]
