-----------------------------------------------
In the autumn of 2016 and 2017, severe shrinking and chlorotic and yellowing symptoms resembling viroid infections were observed on strawberry plants in Shandong Province. Samples were collected from 10 plants exhibiting yellowing and 10 symptomless plants. Specific primers were utilized to detect HSVd through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). An amplicon of 306 bp was obtained from each of the 10 symptomatic samples. Two different HSVd sequences were obtained, and both of them shared a homology of 97.3% with HSVd isolates from grapevine in China.

Strawberry leaves of 3 varieties were inoculated. Approximately 4 weeks after, the inoculated plants exhibited chlorotic and yellowing symptoms. RNA was assayed for the presence of HSVd by RT-PCR and return polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (R-PAGE). Amplicons of 306 bp were detected from all the inoculated strawberries; the target bands were detected by R-PAGE. Thus, the presence of HSVd was confirmed.

HSVd has been detected in many kinds of crops in China [e.g. see ProMED-mail posts 20060710.1888 & 20060523.1456], but to our knowledge, this is the 1st report of HSVd affecting strawberry plants in China. Further information on the occurrence and prevalence of HSVd may help to assess the potential effect of this pathogen on strawberry in China.

[_Hop stunt viroid_ (HSVd) is the type species of genus _Hostuviroid_ (family _Pospiviroidae_). It was 1st described in the 1940s as the causal agent of hop stunt disease in Japan. Since then it has been found worldwide infecting a wide range of both woody and herbaceous plants including crops such as citrus, stone fruit species, grapevine and pomegranate. Symptoms range from latent to severe in different hosts. Specific sequence variants have been isolated from hop, almond, apricot, citrus, cucumber, grapevine, peach, pear and plum. Economically important diseases caused by different strains of HSVd include hop stunt, citrus cachexia, cucumber pale fruit, peach dapple and plum dapple.

Three major phylogenetic groups have been suggested, namely plum-type, hop-type and citrus-type isolates. Recombinants of these have also been identified. HSVd strains can vary between ca. 297 (hop and grapevine strains) and 303 nucleotides (cucumber strain). HSVd susceptibility may vary widely between host species and cultivars. While the hop disease is still restricted to few areas worldwide, HSVd-associated diseases of grapevine, citrus and stone fruit are much more widespread, and a grapevine origin of the viroid has been suggested (see link below).

Like most viroids, HSVd can be spread by mechanical means, such as contaminated cutting tools and with infected plants, suckers or cuttings. Disease management may include phytosanitation (removal of infected plants, disinfection of orchard tools) and use of certified clean planting material.
