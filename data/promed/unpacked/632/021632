Table 1: Summary of current week (7), cumulative from epiweeks 1-7, 2020 and comparison with previous year (2019).
Current week (7) [10-16 Feb 2020] / Cumulative weeks 1-7 / Cumulative 2019 weeks 1-7
Suspected cases: 471 / 2176 / 1157
Confirmed cases: 115 / 586 / 355
Probable cases: 3 / 7 / 12
Deaths: 18 / 103 / 75
Case fatality rate (CFR): 15.7 % / 17.6 % / 21.1 %
Number of states affected: 16 / 26 / 21
Local government areas (LGAs) affected: 41 / 101/ 66

Highlights
----------
- In week 7 [10-16 Feb 2020], the number of new confirmed cases increased from 109 cases in week 6 [3-9 Feb 2020] to 115 cases. These were reported from 16 states (Ondo, Edo, Ebonyi, Kano, Kogi, Kaduna, Taraba, Plateau, Bauchi, Enugu, Abia, Benue, Borno, Gombe, Sokoto, and Katsina) (Table 3).
- Cumulatively from week 1 to week 7, 2020, 103 deaths have been reported with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 17.6% which is lower than the CFR for the same period in 2019 (21.1%).
- In total for 2020, 26 states have recorded at least one confirmed case across 101 Local Government Areas (Figure 2 and 3).
- Of all confirmed cases, 73% are from Edo (35%), Ondo (32%), and Ebonyi (6%) states.
- The predominant age group affected is 21-30 years (range: less than 1 to 78 years, median age: 33 years). The male to female ratio for confirmed cases is 1:1.2 (Figure 4).
- The number of suspected cases has significantly increased compared to that reported for the same period in 2019.
- 2 new healthcare workers* were affected in Bauchi and Katsina states in reporting week 7.

Response activities
-------------------
- The National Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) has been activated to coordinate response activities across states. Of the states with confirmed cases, 8 of them have activated state-level EOCs.
- National Rapid Response Teams have been deployed from NCDC to support response activities in 9 states.
- State Public Health Emergency Operations Centre have been activated in affected states.
- The 5 molecular laboratories for Lassa fever testing in the NCDC network are working at full capacity to ensure that all samples are tested and results provided within the shortest turnaround time.
- NCDC is working to support states in Nigeria to identify a treatment centre in every state, while supporting existing ones with care, treatment, and IPC commodities.
- Risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media and other strategies.

Notes on this report
--------------------
Data source
-----------
Information for this disease was case based data retrieved from the National Lassa fever Emergency Operations Centre.

Case definitions
----------------
- Suspected case: any individual presenting with one or more of the following: malaise, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia, chest pain, hearing loss, and has either a) history of contact with excreta or urine of rodents or b) history of contact with a probable or confirmed Lassa fever case within a period of 21 days of onset of symptoms. OR Any person with inexplicable bleeding/hemorrhagia.
- Confirmed case: any suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, PCR or virus isolation).
- Probable case: any suspected case (see definition above) who died or absconded without collection of specimen for laboratory testing.
- Contact: anyone who has been exposed to an infected person, or to an infected person's secretions, excretions, or tissues within 3 weeks of last contact with a confirmed or probable case of Lassa fever.

*Healthcare worker (HCW) infections may not necessarily be of nosocomial origin, proposed study to differentiate nosocomial healthcare worker infection from community infection.

Calculations
------------
- Case fatality rate (CFR) for this disease is reported for confirmed cases only

[The 115 new confirmed and 471 new suspected cases in week 6 (3-9 Feb 2020) indicate that Lassa fever (LF) virus transmission is continuing at a relatively high level. There are now 75 deaths among confirmed cases so far this year (2020). There are 2 new infected healthcare workers during the current week (week 7). The report above confirms that Ondo and Edo states have the majority of cases. The area affected continues to grow. There are now 26 states and 101 local government areas with at least one case. Nigeria is now well into the period of the year when more cases usually occur, as illustrated in the graph in Figure 6 (available at the source URL above). There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (January-March) over the past 3 years, and it appears that this will be the case again this year (2020).

Transmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It is encouraging to learn that risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies for avoidance of contact with rodent virus reservoirs and their excreta.
