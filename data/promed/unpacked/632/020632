I am afraid that I find Mr Pringle's gloomy thoughts about CJD and blood
transfusion a little over pessimistic. I find it hard to believe that any
significant transmission would be overlooked given the considerable number
of young and very young people who have had blood transfusions and the very
low mortality to CJD by even middle aged people. To say that this is merely
a reflection of a 40 to 50 year incubation period is another way of saying
that the evidence is flimsy at best. Maybe any incubation period is 60-70
years or 90-110 years or most likely doesn't observably occur at all.
As to the purported hazard of BSE in trace amounts from pre-clinical
cases one can at least look at other existing systems for a guide. There is
no doubt that pre-clinical scrapie infected sheep have been consumed by
humans in the UK for some centuries and unlike BSE considerable numbers of
body parts are known to be infective by mouse assay. (Note that this
includes spinal column consumed in lamb chops). It is also clear that for
marmosets the onset of symptoms for scrapie is significantly more rapid
than for BSE when infective material is
injected into the brain, which IMHO is very strongly indicative of
higher infectivity. Despite this there is no indication whatever that
Britain has a higher incidence of CJD than countries (such as Australia and
New Zealand) that have no scrapie. Indeed all the trials I can remember
seeing showed scrapie to be more infectious than BSE by this criterion. It
thus seems to me that the risk, if any, from eating CNS free beef products
from the UK, or other countries with BSE, is minute if not
indistinguishable from zero.
Indeed when you consider that it is very likely that at least some
clinically BSE affected cattle brains, let alone the pre-clinical ones,
were consumed by humans in Britain before 1987 the fact that nv-CJD cases
over three to five years still numbers some 17, or about 10% of the CJD
cases expected over three years in the UK, the level of concern seems quite
unwarranted and grossly out of proportion.
One might be wise to look through any political motive for this concern and
direct much needed funds to far more worthy causes where it can save lives
for hundreds, even many tens of thousands, of people. Those of us that
consumed British beef during the 80's are either infected or not and the
safeguards that were put in place in 87 to 90 have certainly reduced the
original tiny risk many millionfold to a quite insignificant figure, if not
indistinguishable from zero.
One should face facts that CJD is not in mortality terms an important
disease, indeed it is a minor disease in the group of minor diseases, if
academically an interesting one. Thus far, and hopefully this will
continue, nv-CJD is a minor subset of CJD.
