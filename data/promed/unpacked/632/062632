Human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses
----------------------------------------------------
From 2003 through 20 Dec 2013, 648 laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection have been officially reported to WHO from 15 countries. Of these cases, 384 died. Since the last WHO Influenza at the Human-Animal Interface update on 10 Dec 2013, no new laboratory-confirmed human cases of influenza A(H5N1) virus infection were reported to WHO.

Overall public health risk assessment for avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses: Whenever influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, sporadic infections or small clusters of human cases are possible, especially in people exposed to infected household poultry or contaminated environments. However, this influenza A(H5N1) virus does not currently appear to transmit easily among people. As such, the risk of community-level spread of this virus remains low.

Human infection with other non-seasonal influenza viruses
---------------------------------------------------------
Avian influenza A(H7N9) in China
--------------------------------
Since the last update of 10 Dec 2013, China has reported 4 new cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus, from Guangdong province, with onset dates between 6 and 11 Dec 2013. All new patients are in a critical condition. Most human A(H7N9) cases have reported contact with poultry or live bird markets. Knowledge about the main virus reservoirs, and the extent and distribution of the virus in animals remains limited.

Because this virus causes only subclinical infections in poultry, it is possible that the virus continues to circulate in China and perhaps in neighbouring countries without being detected. As such, reports of additional human cases and infections in animals would not be unexpected, especially with onset of winter in the Northern Hemisphere and as poultry production and movement increase in the region in anticipation of the Chinese New Year Holidays. Although 5 small family clusters have been reported, evidence does not currently support sustained human-to-human transmission of this virus. Overall public health risk assessment for avian influenza A(H7N9) virus: Sporadic human cases and small clusters would not be unexpected in previously affected areas of China, and possibly neighbouring countries. The current likelihood of community-level spread of this virus is considered to be low.

Continued vigilance is needed within China and neighbouring areas to detect infections in animals and humans. WHO advises countries to continue surveillance and other preparedness actions, including ensuring appropriate laboratory capacity. All human infections with non-seasonal influenza viruses such as avian influenza A(H7N9) are reportable to WHO under the International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005. Symptomatic individuals with exposure to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus should receive prompt antiviral treatment. Antiviral chemoprophylaxis post avian influenza A(H7N9) virus exposure is generally not recommended. For asymptomatic individuals at high-risk due to type of exposure or underlying conditions who have been exposed to a patient with confirmed avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection, presumptive antiviral treatment with oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir can be considered. Current technical information as well as guidance related to avian influenza A(H7N9) can be found at: http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/influenza_h7n9/en/index.html.

Avian influenza A(H10N8) in China
---------------------------------
On 17 Dec 2013, China reported a human infection with avian influenza A(H10N8) virus in Jiangxi province. The patient was a 73-year-old female with multiple comorbidities, who was hospitalized on 30 Nov 2013 with severe pneumonia and died 6 Dec 2013. The comorbidities of the patient might have contributed to a more severe illness than if the patient had been previously healthy. The patient had a history of exposure to a live bird market. Although avian influenza A(H10N8) virus has been previously reported in wild and domestic birds, this is the 1st human case of influenza A(H10N8) infection.
