A farmer [in a parish in Manabí province] reports that 40 per cent of his melons were damaged by a disease that appeared recently. It affects 3 out of 4 fruits on a plant, causing spots followed by rot.

The Ministry of Agriculture said they are aware of the disease. It was noticed a few years ago and is thought to be connected with climate change and the crop cultivars planted. In 2017, it is more severe than before and is expected to affect yield and quality of short-lived crops like melon, watermelon, and papaya. The higher incidence is attributed to high humidity and increased insect activity. Farmers are also blamed for incorrect use of agrochemicals. and not practicing crop rotation.

[A number of diseases have been reported on both melons and papaya in the region. While there are some fungal and bacterial pathogens that have a wide host range, more than one crop disease may be affecting the area. An increased insect activity, as mentioned above, is known to favour the spread of multiple plant pathogens, either as specific vectors or unspecifically through mechanical injuries inflicted on the plants. Separate and reliable diagnosis of any pathogens affecting the different hosts will be essential for disease management.
