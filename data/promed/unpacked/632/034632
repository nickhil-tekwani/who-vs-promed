New Zealand authorities have triggered a global recall of up to 1000 tons of dairy products across 7 countries after dairy giant Fonterra announced tests had turned up a type of bacterium that could cause botulism. New Zealand's Ministry of Primary Industries said Saturday, 3 Aug 2013, that the tainted products include infant formula, sports drinks, protein drinks, and other beverages. It said countries affected beside New Zealand include China, Australia, Thailand, Malaysia, Viet Nam and Saudi Arabia. Fonterra said its customers were urgently checking their supply chains. One New Zealand company has locked down 5 batches of infant formula and China is asking importers to immediately recall products.

Fonterra is the world's 4th-largest dairy company, with annual revenues of about 16 billion dollars. The news comes as a blow to New Zealand's dairy industry, which powers the country's economy. New Zealand exports about 95 percent of its milk.

Consumers in China and elsewhere are willing to pay a big premium for New Zealand infant formula because the country has a clean and healthy reputation. Chinese consumers have a special interest after tainted local milk formula killed 6 babies in 2008.

Fonterra said it has told 8 of its customers of the problem, which dates back more than a year, and they were investigating whether any of the affected product is in their supply chains. Fonterra said those companies will initiate any consumer product recalls. At a news conference Sat 3 Aug 2013, Fonterra repeatedly refused to divulge the companies, countries, or specific products affected. Gary Romano, the managing director of Fonterra's New Zealand milk products, said his company supplies raw materials to the 8 companies and it is up to them to inform their consumers of what products might be tainted.

The company did acknowledge its chief executive, Theo Spierings, planned to fly to China Saturday [3 Aug 2013], in part to deal with the fallout from the botulism scare.

New Zealand's Ministry for Primary Industries said that New Zealand company Nutricia had used some of the tainted product in its Karicare line of formula for infants aged over 6 months. Nutricia had locked down all 5 batches of infant formula it believed contained the tainted product, the ministry said. But it advised that parents should buy different Nutricia products or alternative brands until it verified the location of all tainted Nutricia products.

Romano said the problem was caused by unsterilized pipes at a Waikato factory. He said 3 batches of whey protein weighing about 42 tons were tainted in May 2012, adding that Fonterra has since cleaned the pipes. The New Zealand ministry says the tainted product has been mixed with other ingredients to form about 1000 tons of consumer products worldwide.

Romano said Fonterra hasn't received reports of anybody getting sick and added that the problem hasn't affected any fresh milk, yoghurt, cheese, or long-lasting heat-treated milk.

China, Viet Nam, and Russia have banned the import of milk powder and whey protein from the New Zealand dairy giant Fonterra after a botulism scare. The company warned on Sat 3 Aug 2013, that a batch of whey protein produced in 2012 contained bacteria that could lead to the illness. The ingredient was exported to factories in China, Saudi Arabia, Viet Nam, Thailand, Malaysia, and Australia.

Chinese shops cleared hundreds of tons of food products from their shelves and officials in Wellington said Beijing had banned imports of all Fonterra milk powder and whey protein. They added that Moscow had banned all New Zealand dairy goods despite not receiving any of the affected products.

Fonterra's chief executive, Theo Spierings, told a press conference in Beijing on Mon 5 Aug 2013, that products containing the whey protein sold by Coca-Cola and the Chinese firm Wahaha, one of the country's biggest food producers, were safe.

Fonterra said it had received no reports of any ill health linked to consumption of the affected products.

Other affected companies in China are Shanghai Tangjiu and Dumex Baby Food. Dumex had already sold more than 400 tons of milk powder products made with the affected whey protein, according to state media, citing Chinese safety authorities. The New Zealand company Nutricia and Malaysia's Danone Dumex had also recalled some batches of baby milk.

Australian officials said they had quarantined potentially affected baby milk but did not believe it had gone on sale, while Thai officials were expected to make an announcement on Mon 5 Aug 2013.
