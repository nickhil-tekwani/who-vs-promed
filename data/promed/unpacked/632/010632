Staph. Outbreak at Florida Jail Spreads
-------------------------------------------------
An assistant public defender contracted the bacterium commonly known as
MRSA -- methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ -- in Jan 2004 at the
Palm Beach County Jail. She eventually had surgery to drain the infection
in her right arm and is back at work. Her boss, Public Defender Carey
Haughwout, said her office was warned about the staphylococcal outbreak at
the jail.
"I have a concern they have been on notice about it for awhile and have not
taken corrective action until now," Haughwout said.
On Thu 1 Apr 2004, the jail was being scrubbed from ceiling to floor with a
bleach solution while sheriff's deputies at the downtown courthouse were
equipped with disinfectant spray and antibacterial lotion.
The county health department has documented 339 cases of the staph
infection at the jail since Sep 2003. The health department told jail
officials to culture all inmate wounds in Dec 2003. Shortly thereafter, the
health department declared an outbreak of staphylococcus, which usually
manifests itself as open or closed pustules on the skin.
The bacteria can be passed by touching clothing or shared surfaces, such as
a bathroom floor. MRSA is resistant to many of the commonly used
antimicrobials.
Prison Health Services and the sheriff's office said they have taken the
outbreak seriously. They have isolated infected inmates in a single unit --
about 30 this week -- and have checked the temperatures of clothes dryers.

[It is not obvious from the posting whether the MRSA in question is
community-associated (CA) or hospital-associated. Either could be the case
as prisoners could have acquired the relatively recently characterized CA
strains or might have brought the hospital strains from a recent admission.
Clear-cut differences exist between the strains. Most notably, most of the
CA strains are resistant to only the beta-lactam type of antimicrobial
(antistaphylococcal penicillins, cephalosporins) like the hospital strains,
but, unlike its hospital cousin, CA MRSA can be sensitive to many other
antimicrobials such as macrolides and clindamycin. - Mod.LL]
