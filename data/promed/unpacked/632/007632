Exposure to Ebola Reston virus confirmed
----------------------------------------
A total of 4 Filipinos were found to have been exposed to Ebola
Reston virus that was discovered in pig farms in the Philippines,
Health officials confirmed Friday [30 Jan 2009]. But Health Secretary
Francisco Duque III said the public should not be alarmed as the 4
workers had antibodies that indicated they had developed an immunity
to the virus.

"There is no cause for worry so long as you follow the 4 steps the
Department of Health has prescribed," Duque said in an interview on
dzBB radio. The steps include keeping infected hogs out of the food
chain, taking bio-safety and bio-security measures, making sure pork
is cooked, and avoiding "double-dead" meat.

Radio dzBB's Carlo Mateo quoted National Epidemiology Center head Eric
Tayag as saying "3 of the 5" [sic] were from affected hog farms, one
from Valenzuela in Metro Manila, and one from a backyard farm. Tayag
said they were still investigating how the 4 were exposed to the
virus. The 4 tested positive for exposure to Ebola Reston virus but
showed normal immune systems and do not need to be quarantined. "They
have an immunity against the virus. They do not need to be
quarantined. They are not infectious," he said.

The 4 Filipinos were among 77 who gave blood samples to DOH workers.

[Previously it was reported that one out of some 50 farm workers
employed on 2 farms, which had experienced outbreaks of Ebola-Reston
disease in pigs, tested positive for Ebola-Reston virus antibodies.
The number of blood samples screened for Ebola-Reston antibodies has
been increased to 77 and a further 3 positive sera have been
identified. It is presumed that none of these 4 antibody-positive
individuals exhibited signs of illness and that no infectious virus
has been recovered. These low-grade infections suggest that
productive infection of humans is rare and that exposure to the virus
is not a serious hazard for those enaged in animal husbandry.

A disquieting feature of these results, however, is that one of the
positive sera originated from a backyard farmer, indicating that
Ebola-Reston virus infection of pigs may be widespread in the
Philippines. - Mod.CP]
