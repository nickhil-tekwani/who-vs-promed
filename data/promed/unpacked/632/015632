The following background information on Australian (Murray Valley)
encephalitis is extracted from GIDEON <http://www.cyinfo.com>:
"...Murray Valley encephalitis [MVE was first characterized during an
outbreak of 45 cases involving the Murray and Darling River areas during
1950 to 1951. Additional isolated cases were registered in southeastern
Australia (1956), northwestern Australia (1969) and southern Queensland (1971).
In retrospect, outbreaks of [what was known as 'Australian X disease',
which had caused 300 cases (65% fatal) in 1917, 1918, 1922 and 1925, were
due to the same agent.
MVE is most common in the Northern Territory (notably the area north of
Tennant Creek), Queensland and Western Australia. Epidemics occurred in
1951 and 1974.
Some studies have suggested seroconversion in 90% of Northern Australian
children by age 10 years.
58 cases (13 fatal) were reported in 1974 - 39 of these in the Murray
Valley region. Approximately 44 cases (with case-fatality ratio of 20% to
42%) were reported during 1974 to 1993, all in the northern region
(principally Pilbara and Kimberly in Western Australia). Three cases were
reported during January to April 1993; two cases during January to May 1997
(Carnarvaon, WA and Broome, WA). No cases were reported in 1998; 0 in 1999.
The principal reservoirs are Ciconiiform birds.
The local vector is _Culex annulirostris_. _Cx. bitaeniorhynchus_ and
_Aedes normanensis_ have also been implicated.
A similar local disease is ascribed to Kunjin (KUN) virus. Infection by KUN
virus is generally milder than that with MVE, with a lower rate of
encephalitis. KUN virus appears to have been responsible for some of the
'Murray Valley encephalitis' cases reported in 1974, and was implicated in
an additional sporadic case in northern Victoria in 1984. KUN virus is more
widely distributed than is MVE, and is found in most of tropical Australia,
eastern Queensland, and occasionally southeastern Australia.
Queensland reported two cases in 1996. A presumptive case of KUN virus
infection was reported in Pilbara, WA in 1997. Total cases reported for
1997 were 4 (2 Western Australia and 2 Northern Territory). The vectors for
KUN virus are _Culex annulirostris_, _Cx. pseudovishnui_ and _Cx.
squamosis_.
As of 2000, 53 sentinel chicken flocks are used to monitor the activity of
MVE and KUN viruses."
