The ongoing fatal outbreak in Nepal may or may not be due to influenza, and
if influenza is prevalent it is still possible that many of the deaths are
associated with other conditions. As influenza is well known to be poorly
distinguishable clinically from many other diseases, rapid laboratory
diagnosis is essential not only in a clinical setting, but also, and
especially so, in outbreak detection and investigation.
However, PCR, viral isolation, and strain identification all require
sophisticated laboratory back-up, following careful specimen collection,
storage and transport. The WHO Collaborating influenza laboratory system
cannot possibly handle all international outbreaks, let alone provide
surveillance and diagnostic support.
[But of course, the WHO system does provide a valuable service in the areas
it does cover. It could cover more if given greater resources - Mod.JW
At the recent US/Japan Cooperative Medical Sciences meeting on emerging
infectious diseases (Bangkok, 2-4 March 1999) influenza was the major focus.
These international experts (largely from the Asia-Pacific region, from
which new influenza strains often emerge) were unanimous in recommending an
urgent expansion of the international infrastructure for influenza
surveillance (human and zoonotic), response and support of outbreak
investigations, research, and also for provision of rapid
diagnostics for field and bedside use.
Influenza has killed more people in this century alone than any other
epidemic disease at any point in time, including such pandemics as AIDS or
the Black Death (bubonic/pneumonic plague) of the 14th century. As
influenza is a classic example of a pandemic disease for which preparedness
alone, in the form of basic public health "surveillance-response", may save
countless lives, the institutionalization of public and public health apathy
is discouraging.
Regarding "deadly" and "virulent" influenza in Western Nepal, it is probably
fair to say that all strains of human influenza are capable of producing
significant mortality. We used to anticipate increased fatality associated
with an influenza A "shift" (to a new "H" or "N" type) every 10 or so years,
but in recent decades we have witnessed substantial mortality associated
with chronic "drift" within H3N2 and H1N1 types. Nevertheless, shifts must
always be aggressively looked for, as in the case of last year's H5N1 Hong
Kong influenza.
Within influenza types, determinants of virulence and pathogenicity are
poorly understood. Escape from population immunity as a result of viral
antigenic drift may be only part of the story, as suggested by occasional
unexplained increases in influenza A mortality in stable populations facing
slow ongoing drift. The effect on viral strain evolution of increasing
rates of vaccination (versus natural infection-induced immunity) has not
been adequately studied either, but may not be relevant to Nepal, where
vaccination rates are undoubtedly quite low.
