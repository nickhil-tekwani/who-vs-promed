[1] UK (Scotland): Ebola case confirmed ex Sierra Leone

UK Ebola woman worked with charity
------------------------------------
An NHS [UK National Health Service] worker who has been diagnosed with Ebola after returning to Glasgow from Sierra Leone had been working in the country with Save the Children. The woman is currently in a stable condition in hospital in Glasgow but will be transferred to specialist facilities in London as soon as possible.

She flew back to the UK via Casablanca and London Heathrow before arriving at Glasgow Airport at around 11.30pm yesterday on a British Airways flight. She was admitted to hospital early this morning after feeling feverish and was placed into isolation in the Brownlee Unit for Infectious Diseases at the city's Gartnavel Hospital at 7.50am. Health officials are tracing the 71 other people who were on the British Airways flight from London to Glasgow with the woman.

Michael von Bertele, Save the Children humanitarian director, said: "We can confirm that an NHS health worker working with Save the Children at the Ebola Treatment Centre at Kerry Town, Sierra Leone, has tested positive for Ebola. Our thoughts are with the individual, [her] family and colleagues at this difficult time. We wish [her] a speedy recovery. Save the Children is working closely with the UK Government, Scottish Government and Public Health England to look into the circumstances surrounding the case."

Apart from the other passengers on the flight and hospital staff the patient is thought to have had contact with only one other person in Scotland, who is being contacted. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the risk to the general public is "extremely low to the point of negligible". According to UK and Scottish protocol for anyone diagnosed with Ebola, the patient will be transferred to the high-level isolation unit in the Royal Free Hospital, north London, as soon as possible.

Ms Sturgeon said: "Given the early stage of the diagnosis, the patient was displaying no symptoms of the kind that would lead to onward transmission and put other people at risk before she reported as being unwell. "Passengers on both the flight from Casablanca to Heathrow and Heathrow to Glasgow are being traced and contacted. They will be given the appropriate advice and reassurance."... - more

[2] USA: FDA approves Roche Ebola test

Roche Holding AG said U.S. health regulators have approved its Ebola test for emergency use in response to the world's worst outbreak of the disease in West Africa.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Roche's LightMix Ebola Zaire rRT-PCR test for use on patients with signs and symptoms of Ebola Zaire virus infection, the Swiss drug maker said in a statement. Roche said the LightMix test can generate results in just over 3 hours, helping to detect the virus quickly so treatment can start as soon as possible.

Under the emergency use designation, certain laboratories in the US and other countries have been authorized to use the test for a limited period to detect the type of Ebola that has been spreading in West Africa. The test, made by TIB MOLBIOL GmbH and distributed by Roche, has not been approved by the FDA for general use.

[3] World: Ebola virus still a global threat

White House Ebola Czar Ron Klain warned Sunday [28 Dec 2014] that the virus is still a global threat and will continue to be until it is completely wiped out.

"This won't be done until we get all the way to zero," Klain said on CBS's "Face the Nation." He said the United States has made "significant strides" to prepare for the occasional case of Ebola, but West Africa is still struggling with its outbreak.

While Liberia has reduced new cases of Ebola from 50-100 a day to 5-10 a day, Sierra Leone and Guinea aren't having the same success.
