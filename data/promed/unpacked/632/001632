A total of 6 Ukrainian nationals employed at a sausage factory in Morlino near northern Poland's Ostroda are reported to have been infected with measles, Radio Poland reported [16 Jan 2018]. According to Ostroda's state sanitary inspector, 5 men with the symptoms of measles were admitted to a local hospital. The diagnosis has been confirmed for the 4 of them. Another person was sick with measles a week earlier, Radio Poland says.

It is noted that more than 700 factory workers who had contact with patients will be vaccinated, while specialists stress that factory products are safe. According to the State sanitary inspection in Ostroda, there have been no cases of measles reported in the area for the past 10 years.

As Unian reported earlier, Acting Health Minister of Ukraine Uliana Suprun said 4782 cases of measles were reported in Ukraine in 2017, with 75 percent of the patients being underage. Among those infected, 86 percent had not been vaccinated. Suprun added that the virus got to Ukraine from Romania where the vaccination rate is also low.

A case of measles has been confirmed in Limerick. As a precaution, the HSE [Health Service Executive] is writing to all patients identified as being at risk of exposure advising them that they may be at risk of infection. There was a risk of exposure having occurred at the following times and place (see report at URL above for list of times and locations)

Anyone who has been exposed and is not immune to measles (either through natural infection or MMR vaccination) may develop measles up to 3 weeks following date of exposure.

Measles is highly contagious and is spread easily. The time between exposure to measles and developing the rash is usually 14 days (range 7--21 days). People are infectious from 4 days before rash starts until 4 days after.

Measles symptoms include: high fever; cough; runny nose; red eyes; red rash that starts on head and spread down the body - this normally starts a few days after onset of illness (the rash consists of flat red or brown blotches, which can flow into each other; it lasts about 4--7 days); vomiting diarrhoea and tummy pain may also happen.

Prevent measles with the MMR vaccine
------------------------------------
The best protection against measles is to be fully vaccinated with 2 doses of the MMR (Measles-Mumps-Rubella) vaccine. All children should get MMR at 12 months of age and the 2nd dose at 4-5 years of age. If your child missed their scheduled MMR vaccine dose you should contact your GP to get the age appropriate dose.

People most at risk of catching measles are those who either have not had measles infection in the past or are not fully vaccinated with 2 doses of MMR vaccine such as babies younger than 12 months who are too young to be vaccinated, and those with weakened immune systems.

Serbia celebrated the New Year with more than 680 new cases of people infected by a curable disease, measles. Two 2-year-olds from the city of Nis, Jakov and Vuk, died just before the New Year 2018 arrived. The first death in the New Year occurred in Belgrade, where a 30-year-old man died from complications caused by the virus. The infection toll keeps rising, and the number of currently infected people stands at around 900. It is unknown when, or whether, the Ministry of Health will proclaim an epidemic, a prerequisite for adults to receive vaccinations that could prevent them from getting sick and possibly die. The total share of those infected that were unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status stands at around 91 percent.

[Similar to the report above on the Ukraine, 91 percent of those infected in Serbia were unvaccinated (or had unknown vaccination status). The MMR vaccine is such an effective and safe vaccine against measles, and the virus is so contagious and potentially dangerous, it is disturbing that people are missing the opportunity to protect themselves and/or their children.

Since November 2017, 77 cases have been recorded in the Bordeaux area - of which 12 have included hospitalisations.

The epidemic has been traced to an outbreak at the city's university campus, prompting health agency L'Agence regionale de sante (ARS) to warn of "a lack of vaccination coverage" in the area.

Figures from Sante Publique France show that Gironde had an 80.3 percent vaccination coverage in 2015, coming in well under the World Health Organisation (WHO)'s recommendation of 95 percent.

No department in France has yet reached the recommended 95 percent rate, as public confidence in vaccinations shown to have dropped to just 75 percent in [October 2017] (according to figures from Sante Publique France's most recent Barometre Sante study) compared to 90 percent support in the 2000s.

The vaccination against measles is, however, one of the 11 mandatory vaccinations brought into force since 1 Jan this year [2018], alongside rubella and mumps, with the 1st dose given at 12 months, and the 2nd 16-18 months, explains newspaper Le Monde. Those who did not receive the vaccination as a child are still able to get it retrospectively at any age.

Measles is often known as a benign illness that primarily affects young children, but the ARS is warning that it can affect people of all ages, and become very serious - especially for those under 5 or over 30 years - causing problems such as brain inflammation (encephalitis), lung infections, and even blindness.

Spread through the air and very contagious, the virus stays active for 2 hours after leaving an ill person's body.

People become contagious the night before their symptoms 1st appear, meaning that they can spread the illness before they are even aware they have it, with one person easily managing to infect 15--20 people each if they are in contact with them.

At least 10 people have died from measles in the past decade in France, according to figures from the WHO, of which 3 were not vaccinated for no apparent reason, and the rest were not able to receive the vaccination due to being too young, having compromised immune systems, or pregnancy.

Hence, vaccination is recommended even to healthy older people in their 20s and above, as wider vaccination coverage can help protect those who are not able to receive the jab.

Symptoms include a runny nose, high fever, a cough, red eyes, mouth sores; and a red rash over the face, neck, and body.

The ARS has this month issued advice on how to avoid spreading the disease further, with workers and students warned to stay at home for at least 5 days once the first symptoms appear, and in an epidemic period, this should be extended to 10 days. Everyone should practice good hand washing hygiene, using water and soap plus a bacterial-killing alcohol gel afterwards. Similarly, those affected should avoid contact with as many people as possible, especially non-vaccinated children; and if leaving the house becomes absolutely necessary, a medical face mask should be worn. Rooms and bedrooms that house affected people should be aired out frequently, and the ill person should wear a mask even when interacting with other people in the household or when leaving their bedroom.

France is not the only European nation to be affected by a resurgence of measles of late; Italy and Romania have also both reported an increase in cases in the past 2 years, including over 30 deaths.

Indonesian authorities are struggling to contain a months-long outbreak of measles in easternmost Papua province that has killed dozens of children.

Stefanus Lange, a doctor at a state-run hospital in Papua's Asmat district, said [Tue 16 Jan 2018] that cases were 1st detected in [September 2017], but a lack of access to remote areas, insufficient personnel and the high mobility of villagers hampered treatment and vaccination efforts.

Lange said 36 victims died in Pulau Tiga sub-district and 22 died in Agats, the main town and capital of Asmat district. He did not rule out the possibility of a higher number of victims since reports have not been received from some sub-districts.

Papua and neighboring West Papua are the poorest provinces in Indonesia and home to a decades-old independence movement and armed insurgency. The region is culturally and ethnically distinct from the rest of Indonesia, which annexed it in the early 1960s.

Data from hospitals showed a total of 568 people had been treated for measles since September and 175 required hospitalization. The data also showed that one child died in Pulau Tiga of malnutrition, which has plagued some villages in the district.

A team of more than 50 doctors and paramedics from the Indonesian military arrived [Tue 16 Jan 2018] in the province to help overcome the disease.

Changing minds on vaccination is very difficult, but it isn't so important when a law can change behavior.

In [December 2014] something unusual happened at Disneyland. People came to visit Mickey Mouse, and some of them left with measles. At least 159 people contracted the disease during an outbreak lasting several months. This is more than the typical number in a whole year in the United States.

The leading theory is that measles was introduced in Disneyland by a foreign tourist. That could happen anywhere. Medical experts generally agree that the fact that it took off was probably a result of California's low vaccination rates, which in turn was a result of an inability to persuade a significant share of Californians that vaccines were important.

The episode made national news, but in the next few years, another development was striking but attracted less national attention: because of a policy change, California was able to turn it around. Data from a county-by county analysis shows that in many schools with the lowest vaccination rates, there was an increase of 20 -- 30 percentage points in the share of kindergartners vaccinated between 2014 and 2016. One law changed the behavior of impassioned resisters more effectively than a thousand public service announcements might have.

Limiting outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases relies on "herd immunity." Essentially, if enough people are vaccinated, a disease cannot get a foothold. For measles, this number is around 90 - 95 percent. In other words, if 95 percent of people in an area are vaccinated for measles, an outbreak is unlikely even if the disease is introduced.

Our best data on vaccination rates, in California and elsewhere, relies on records collected from schools at kindergarten entry. California requires these records from all schools, public and private, so they provide a comprehensive measure.

In 2014, for California over all, about 93 percent of entering kindergartners were vaccinated for measles. This wasn't bad. It could have been better -- a place like North Carolina is at about 98 percent -- but this was a high enough rate to be in the range of herd immunity.

The trouble is that herd immunity is about the vaccination rate among the people you interact with, and you're not interacting with the entire state of California. Local vaccination rates matter. If the overall state vaccination rate of 93 percent was because each area had a vaccination rate of 93 percent that would be one thing. But if it's because a bunch of areas had very high rates, and a bunch had lower ones, that's quite another. And this second case was California in 2014. The accompanying chart gives a sense of the distribution of vaccination rates across counties in California in 2014 [see NY Times report for this chart].

In 2014, there were a lot of areas of California with very low vaccination rates. If we take the herd immunity rate to be 95 percent, 70 percent of children were in counties below that rate. Even taking the bottom of the herd immunity range -- 90 percent -- found 36 percent of children in counties below that rate.

A focus on individual schools was even more striking. At the Berkeley Rose School, in Alameda County, only 13 percent of kindergarten students were up to date on vaccinations in 2014. George De La Torre Jr. Elementary, in Los Angeles, was at 14 percent. The Community Outreach Academy, a large public school in Sacramento, was at 46 percent. These were on the lower end -- but they were not the lowest rates.

There were 2 ways a student could be unvaccinated in 2014 in the California public schools. Some students were admitted "conditionally" -- that is, not fully vaccinated but planning to be soon. Other students had a formal "personal belief exemption." That is, for religious or other reasons -- often misplaced fears of vaccine injury -- the parents could choose not to vaccinate their children at all.

These varied greatly across schools. In the Berkeley Rose School, a private Waldorf school, all of the unvaccinated students (87 percent of the kindergartners) had personal belief exemptions. In elementary schools in poorer parts of Los Angeles, the lack of up-to-date vaccination was due mostly to conditional enrollment. In practice, in this period there was little follow-up on the vaccination of conditionally enrolled students, so conditional non-vaccination could easily turn into long-term non-vaccination. In the end, the result was the same: many schools with many unvaccinated children, and they were at risk. Measles is extremely contagious. If you introduce it into a school where only 13 percent of students are vaccinated, a lot of people will become ill.

In response to the Disneyland outbreak, California suddenly went from a state with quite lax school vaccination standards to one with extremely strict requirements. The state passed Senate Bill 277, which went into effect in 2016 and eliminated all personal belief exemptions and tightened the approach to conditionally enrolled students. No longer could a parent say, "I'll do it later"; there had to be a plan for vaccine completion over a period of about 6 months.

The only remaining exemptions were for medical reasons. And since all schools, public and private, have to report the vaccination status of enrolled children, including documentation, the state has a way to monitor this. Without seeing your vaccination records, a school simply is not allowed to enroll you. And children have to be enrolled in school.

Public health researchers have studied the relationship between state vaccination rules and vaccination rates, and have generally found that stricter vaccination laws generate higher vaccination rates on average. But these studies tend to focus on state levels over all, rather than on the distribution. In a place like California, with so many low-vaccination schools, we had a chance to ask: What would actually happen?

What happened was that people got vaccinated.

In 2016, 97 percent of children lived in counties with a kindergarten vaccination rate above 95 percent, and a full 99.5 percent in places over 90 percent.

Looking at the school level, we can see which schools contributed to this change. We took schools in 2014 and divided them into 10 groups based on their vaccination rates. For each group of schools, we calculated their vaccination rates in 2014 and 2016. This provided a way to summarize which group of schools accounted for the changes over time.

In the accompanying chart [see NY Times report at URL above], we see the results. Schools in the bottom group had about 60 percent of their students up to date on vaccines in 2014. This is pretty abysmal, and this is an average, so many places were even lower. By 2016, this group had close to a 90 percent vaccination rate. It was an astonishing 25-percentage-point increase in vaccinations over a period of just 2 years.

When we look at what drives this, one big factor is a huge decline in the conditional enrollment numbers. In George De La Torre Jr. Elementary, where 86 percent of children were conditionally enrolled with no measles vaccine in 2014, the vaccination rate in 2016 was 99 percent.

But perhaps more striking are the changes for places where personal belief exemptions were high, places where there was concern that people were really committed to no vaccinations. In the Community Outreach Academy, the vaccination rate increased to 83 percent from 46 percent over this period. This was almost entirely a result of reductions in personal belief exemptions.

And what about the Berkeley Rose School, with its 87 percent personal belief exemption rate? By 2016, 57 percent of entering students were vaccinated -- a huge change, and that was only in the first year of the law.

When SB 277 was passed, people worried about the possible effects: Would children be pulled out of school? This concern was misplaced. Over all, there has been no change in enrollment, even in schools with the lowest vaccination rates in 2014. People worried that parents would substitute (fake) medical exemptions for belief exemptions. This did happen, a little, but not nearly enough to offset the increases.

In the end, the effect of the law was simple: More children were vaccinated, and the risk of disease outbreaks has gone down.

Under-vaccination is a significant policy problem. As earlier generations knew, people die of measles, and of whooping cough, and of other diseases that vaccines can prevent. Figuring out how to increase vaccination is a challenge. We often rely on education, but it is hard to change people's minds on this topic, as doctors and policymakers -- as well as any parents who have engaged on an internet message board -- know all too well.

From a policy standpoint, these findings offer a ray of hope for vaccine proponents. Maybe changing minds isn't so important. People may not have altered their attitudes about vaccination, but the fact is that these laws actually changed behavior.

In Oregon, parents can opt out of getting their children immunized by completing a 15-minute online "education" module. Many of them do: The share of people in Oregon counties with kindergarten vaccination rates over 95 percent was close to 100 percent in 2000; in 2015, it was about 30 percent. Perhaps lawmakers there and in other states should consider a more stringent exemption policy before, not after, they have their own measles outbreak.

[This analysis of the decreased number of cases of measles in California concluded stricter vaccination laws generated higher vaccination rates on average. Counties and schools in the state with poor vaccination coverage demonstrated 25-percentage-point increase in vaccinations over a period of just 2 years under the stricter regulations for exemptions. It is interesting that it took a change in policy to increase vaccination coverage where education on the importance of vaccinations failed. This suggests other states and countries should consider making vaccination with MMR mandatory for children entering school. In report [4] above on measles in France, it states that vaccination against measles is now one of the 11 mandatory vaccinations brought into force since 1 Jan this year [2018]. It will be informative to follow the impact this has on measles infection rate in school-age children in the country.
