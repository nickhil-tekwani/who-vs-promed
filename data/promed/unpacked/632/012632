Bird flu has killed a woman in Indonesia, taking the death toll in the
country worst hit by the deadly virus to 75, a health ministry official
said on Monday [7 May 2007]. [Suhardaningrum, an official from the national
bird flu information centre,] said 2 series of tests confirmed that the 29
year old woman was infected with the deadly H5N1 strain of the virus. The
woman was admitted to the International Hospital in Medan in northern
Sumatra, on 2 May 2007, and died 2 days later, the official said. "There is
a new bird flu victim and it is a woman, the 75th person to die," said
Suhardaningrum. It was unclear how the woman contracted the virus as she
did not have any known contact with sick poultry, the most common form of
infection, other officials said.
The latest death comes as Indonesia is embroiled in a dispute with the
World Health Organization (WHO) over delays on resuming sharing bird flu
samples with the United Nations body. Indonesia agreed in March [2007] to
an immediate resumption -- after reaching a breakthrough agreement in
international talks with WHO to develop a new mechanism on sample-sharing.
But more than 4 weeks later, samples have not been sent. Health minister,
Siti Fadilah Supari, has said Indonesia would not resume sharing samples
aimed at fighting the deadly disease until it receives certain guarantees
in writing. Indonesia stopped sending samples, aimed at fighting the deadly
disease, in December [2006], over concerns that drug firms would use them
to develop costly vaccines beyond [the budgets of poorer countries].
Indonesia wants a guarantee, in writing, that under the March [2007]
agreement, [companies] will need permission from a country for access to
its virus samples.
The Indonesian government had hoped to eradicate human infections this year
[2007]. In their drive to curb the spread of the virus, authorities in the
capital, Jakarta, one of the worst hit areas, have banned the popular
practice of keeping chickens in backyards.
WHO says the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu has infected at least 282
people and killed around 170 of them, mostly in South East Asia, since the
end of 2003. Scientists worry that the virus could mutate into a form
easily spread among humans, leading to a global pandemic with the potential
to kill millions. The fear stems from the lessons of past influenza
pandemics. A flu pandemic in 1918, just after the end of World War 1,
killed 20 million people worldwide.

[A casualty of the dispute over exchange of samples between Indonesia and
WHO is an accurate estimate of the avian influenza H5N1 outbreak death
toll. The Indonesia ministry of health in this report gives the total
number of deaths in Indonesia as 75, including the latest case in Sumatra.
In contrast, WHO's cumulative table of avian influenza deaths (last updated
on 11 Apr 2007) gives the number of confirmed deaths in Indonesia as 63 and
the global total as 172 (see
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2007_04_11/en/index.html>).
Clarification would be welcomed.
This is the 1st human case of avian H5N1 influenza reported from anywhere
for almost one month. - Mod.CP]
