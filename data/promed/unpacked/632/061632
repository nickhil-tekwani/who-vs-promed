The department of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock said they have recently registered 4 cases of lumpy skin disease [in Kandahar]. Lumpy skin disease [LSD] is an infectious disease affecting cattle, and its symptoms include fever, lacrimation, hypersalivation, and characteristic skin eruptions.

"First small rashes are on the body of the cow, and then it increases to the whole body of the cow," said [AW], a resident of Kandahar.

"I think the disease is due to trafficking of livestock through illegal paths," said Shah Wali, in charge of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock Affairs of Daman district of Kandahar province.

"The disease came from Pakistan. This is a contagious disease," said Fahim Sapai, a local veterinary doctor.

The provincial department of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock said that if the central government doesn't take serious action, the virus will further affect the livestock.

[Lumpy skin disease [LSD] continues to spread in Asia. Since 2015, this capripox viral (non-zoonotic) disease of cattle, mainly insect-borne, has spread extensively throughout Asia, reaching China in August 2019 and spreading further into southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. A map, produced 6 Feb 2021, presenting the countries where outbreaks of LSD were notified in 2015-2020, is available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8784982/figure/efs27121-fig-0001/. Since January 2021, the following countries have been added to the list: Sri Lanka, Thailand, Taiwan, Cambodia, Malaysia, Laos, Mongolia, Indonesia, Pakistan, and now, its neighbour Afghanistan (yet to be officially notified to the WOAH).

The most efficient measure shown, so far, to minimise the losses caused by LSD in countries where the disease has managed to get a foothold is preventive vaccination. A list of the 11 most commonly used vaccines registered for use in cattle against LSD, globally, is presented in Table 1 of the following review paper:
