Disease Leads to Poultry Killing in California
-----------------
State and federal agriculture officials have quarantined poultry and some
poultry products in 3 counties after destroying more than 100 000 chickens
infected with Exotic Newcastle Disease.
The deadly poultry disease cannot be contracted by humans. It was first
detected in backyard flocks in October 2002. This week, officials confirmed
it had been discovered at a poultry farm near Riverside.
"Finding it in a commercial flock is a first in California since 1974,"
Larry Hawkins, a spokesman for the US Department of Agriculture (USDA),
said. "It's not only serious because there is a direct threat to the
poultry industry in California, but because it also brings about
quarantines from our trading partners," he said.
A statewide outbreak of the disease in the 1970s threatened the entire US
poultry and egg supply and led authorities to destroy nearly 12 million
chickens. It cost USD 56 million to eradicate the disease.
The California Department of Food and Agriculture and the USDA have
prohibited the movement of all poultry, poultry products, and nesting
materials from Los Angeles County and portions of Riverside and San
Bernardino counties, Hawkins said. Because the disease cannot be
transmitted to humans, eggs are being sanitized and allowed to pass through
the quarantine zone.
California is the nation's third-largest egg producer. More than 9 million
of the state's 12 million egg-laying hens are in the quarantine zone.
A task force made up of state and federal agriculture officials and
scientists has been monitoring the outbreak since it was first reported
among backyard flocks and pets in Southern California. The task force also
has been advising commercial farms on security measures.
Leticia Rico, spokeswoman for the California Department of Food and
Agriculture, would not identify the commercial poultry farm where the
outbreak occurred. "We're recommending to them that their biosecurity
programs should be as stringent as possible," Rico said. "The disease
doesn't discriminate between commercial and backyard birds."
The farmer was participating in a mandatory reporting procedure put in
place in October 2002 and contacted authorities after noticing a slightly
higher than normal mortality rate among chickens.
"At this point, we have euthanized the flock, and they have been safely
disposed of," Rico said. "The facility is being cleaned and disinfected."
