Grady Hospital officials said Thursday [5 Feb 2009] that there has
been a spike of Legionnaire's Disease. Hospital officials said they
have seen as many patients with the condition this month as they have
the entire year last year [2008]. Grady Hospital officials said they
were taking precautions and have shut down 2 hospital units.

Legionnaire's Disease is a type of pneumonia that is treated with
antibiotics. At Grady [Hospital], there have [been] 4 cases since the
beginning of the year [2009]. Legionnaire's Disease is caused by
bacteria [_Legionella pneumophila_], usually in water. The disease
got its name in 1976 when people at an American Legion convention [in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] suffered from an outbreak.

The condition can be deadly, but it isn't transmitted by drinking
water or from person to person. "It has to get into the lungs; [they]
have to inhale the mist. Taking a shower, that would be a place
people could potentially get it," said Dr. Curtis Lewis, Chief Medical Officer.

[_Legionella pneumophila_] can be present in large plumbing or air
conditioning systems. Grady is trying to determine if disease is
coming from inside the hospital by testing the water. "What we're
concerned about is trying to find a location. Was there a common area
these patients had access to?" asked Dr. Lewis.

While testing is being done to find if the bacteria is coming from
within the hospital, a unit on the 11th floor was shut down as a
precaution. It was determined that all 4 patients were in the same
unit within the last 4 weeks.

"We're emptying out a 2nd unit where one patient was. We've done
everything proactively to protect patients and staff. And notified
positions to be aware to recognize symptoms in any patient," said Dr. Lewis.
