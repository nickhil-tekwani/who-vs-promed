After 3 weeks of comprehensive laboratory testing, Biosecurity
Queensland believes that either scrub tick infestation or botulism was
the likely cause of the deaths of 22 horses at a Kooralbyn property.
Chief Biosecurity officer Jim Thompson said both conditions caused
progressive muscular paralysis, as was seen with these horses, and it
was often hard to differentiate between the 2.

"Botulism is a toxin produced by bacteria that live in soil. The toxin
affects the nervous system when the bacteria are ingested," he said.

"The other likely scenario is scrub tick poisoning. Witnesses have
reported that the horses first noticed to be in distress on Thu 6 Oct
2011 had been carrying large numbers of ticks.

"Fatal infestations of scrub tick on adult horses have been recorded
in the past.

"This has been an unusual and complex case. Biosecurity Queensland
worked closely with the attending private veterinarian and Queensland
Health to test a range of samples from the horses and the paddock
where they were kept.

"Despite carrying out such a thorough investigation, we know from
experience that test results don't always pinpoint an exact cause of
death.

"However based on the circumstances, Biosecurity Queensland believes
scrub ticks or botulism were most likely responsible in this case."

Test results have excluded:
- Hendra virus
- pesticides
- heavy metals (arsenic, lead, cyanide, nitrate)
- toxic plants
- water contamination
- deliberate poisoning.

[Sometimes diagnoses are not clear cut. The ticks usually cause
paralysis to begin in the rear of the body and move toward the head.
These horses seemed to have developed paralysis from the head to the
rear end. If the earlier reports are correct concerning the direction
the paralysis developed, then it might rule out ticks.

As horses seldom suffer acute toxicities from nitrates or nitrites, it
is unusual that the lab would have tested for this. Also cyanide is
not usually a toxin that would cause acute death in so many horses.
Cyanide generally causes a neurological disease where the horse has
urinary incontinence.

Sadly some cases do not have a definitive answer - Mod.TG]
