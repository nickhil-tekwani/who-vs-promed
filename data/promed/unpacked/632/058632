The "hawar berdarah" (Hemorrhagic Septicemia) has claimed 4 buffaloes,
bringing the number of animals to have died from the disease so far to 13.
State Veterinary Services Director Dr Ibrahim Che Embong said although
livestock breeders had been briefed on the disease, it still occurred, with
the latest cases detected in Bukit Tunggal mukim on 23 Dec 1999. "Eleven of
the animals were buffaloes while the rest were cows and some calves," he
said when contacted here today.
Dr Ibrahim said the disease was first detected in Kampung Bukit Tunggal on
4 Dec 1999 and later spread to Kampung Gong Tok Kandis, Kampung Conang and
Kampung Pengkalan Atap. He said the department had taken various measures
to keep the disease from spreading but to no effect since the livestock
breeders refused to cooperate.
Dr Ibrahim said the department feared the disease could spread to other
areas if the livestock breeders did not tie their animals. He said the
department would send its officers to Kampung Bukit Tunggal to immunize the
animals against the deadly disease.
There are 537 cows and 61 buffaloes in Kampung Bukit Tunggal.
Besides immunization to prevent widespread occurrences of the disease, the
department also restricted movement of animals from the infected area to
other areas.

[Hemorrhagic septicemia (HS) is an acute pasteurellosis, caused by
particular serotypes of _Pasteurella multocida_ and manifest by an acute
and highly fatal septicemia, particularly in cattle and water buffalo.
Water buffalo are thought to be more susceptible than cattle.
It has been reported in bison, camels, elephants, horses and donkeys, and
there is evidence of its occurrence in yak. An acute pasteurellois
indistinguishable from HAS occurs infrequently in deer, elk and probably
other feral ruminants. Laboratory rabbits and mice are highly susceptible
to experimental infection.
Infection occurs by direct or indirect contact. Natural infection is
through inhalation or ingestion. The source of infective bacteria is
thought to be the nasopharynx of bovine or buffalo carriers. As many as 5
percent of cattle and water buffalo may be carriers in endemic regions. The
initial site of proliferation is thought to be in the tonsillar region. In
susceptible animals, a septicemia develops rapidly, and death due to
endotoxemia ensues within 8-24 hours after the first signs are seen.
Most cases are acute or peracute, resulting in death within 8-24 hours
after onset. Because the course is so short, clinical signs may be easily
overlooked. Animals first show dullness, then reluctance to move, fever,
salivation and serous nasal discharge. Edematous swellings in the throat
region, spreading to parotid region, the neck and brisket are seen. Of then
the edema is hemorrhagic in nature. There is respiratory distress and
usually the animal goes down and dies within hours. Occasional cases linger
for several days. Recovery is rare.
Various sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and penicillin are effective if
administered early. Because of the rapid course of the disease,
antimicrobial therapy is often not practicable.
Means of prevention is through vaccination. The most effective bacterin is
the oil-adjuvant. One dose provides protection for 9-12 months and should
be administered annually. The oil-adjuvant is not popular because of
difficulty in syringing and occasional adverse tissue reactions. A live
vaccine prepared from a B:3,4 serotype of deer origin is being used with
reported success in south east Asia. - Mod.TG
