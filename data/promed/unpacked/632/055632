This sounds like simian hemorrhagic fever [SHF], an arterivirus
disease. There have been several outbreaks in colonies in the US and
USSR. It is a very contagious disease among macaques, with florid
hemorrhage and DIC [disseminated intravascular coagulation]. Other
non-human primates and humans are not affected. It is a chronic
infection of some Patas monkeys.

The clinical picture is close enough to suspect, and the pathology
would be diagnostic. The virus is tricky to work with in cell
culture, but some sequences were published by Jose Sagripanti and by
Margo Brinton's laboratory, so PCR should work. Tissue viral
concentrations are high.

[The Director of Kiyoto University's Primate Research Institute
(PRI), referring to the so-called "haemorrhagic syndrome" in
macaques, is reportedly looking for collaborators (see archived
20100717.2387). The current observation from Prof. CJ Peters, an
eminent authority on the virology, pathogenesis and epidemiology of
hemorrhagic fever viruses, is gratefully acknowledged and is expected
to encourage and enhance collaborative efforts to unravel the
etiology of the syndrome. - Mod.AS]
