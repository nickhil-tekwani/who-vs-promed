Hope that Christmas break will ease Brighton and Hove measles
outbreak
-------
The festive break could help slow a measles outbreak in Brighton and
Hove [in the county of Sussex]. Health bosses are battling to contain
the spread of the virus, which has hit more than 40 people so far this
year. There were 19 new cases confirmed in November and a further
three this month [December]. The actual number is expected to be
higher as tests are being carried out on another 18 samples. Many of
those infected are schoolchildren, who have now broken up [gone home]
for the Christmas holidays. It is hoped the break away from the
enclosed environment of a classroom may reduce the risk of more cases
emerging.

The city's director of public health, Tom Scanlon, said: “We had a
spike in cases in November and we would have liked to see that rate
slowing down more quickly, but it hasn't really been happening yet.
“Hopefully, the Christmas break will help. It just goes to show the
large number of unvaccinated people there are in the city.”

Brighton and Hove has one of the lowest [vaccine] take-up rates for
the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine in the South East. Many parents
were put off the vaccine because of the, now discredited, link between
it and autism. The rate currently stands at more than 80% but this is
nowhere near the 95% recommended by the World Health Organisation as
needed to protect a community. "We are experiencing these cases after
a break last year. This pattern is likely to continue until we can get
those vaccination rates up.” MMR vaccines are normally given at
around the ages of two and five, but they can still be given if a
child is older.

Doctors concerned about outbreak of measles in Ukraine
------------------------------------------------------
Up to 500 people in Ukraine may contract measles by the end of this
year, Ukrainian First Deputy Health Minister Raisa Moiseyenko has
said.

"Some 193 cases were recorded as of 1 Nov 2011, but the number of
patients currently seen in western Ukraine is growing. At the end of
the year, we could have 500 such cases [of measles]," she said at a
press conference in Kyiv on Monday [12 Dec 2011].

At the same time, Moiseyenko noted that anti-epidemic and medical
activities were carried out in the Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk regions
properly and in full.

According to a press release distributed to reporters, the latest
figures of the WHO Regional Office for Europe, over 30 000 cases of
measles have been reported in 29 countries in Europe since January
2011.

Measles epidemic under control
------------------------------
The health authorities in the twn of Mbanza Kongo, the capital of
Zaire province de, declared on Tuesday [13 Dec 2011] that the measles
epidemic which had affected the town since August was now under
control. The outbreak had been responsible for 8 deaths.

In a statement to Angop Manuel Salvado, Director of the Infectious
Disease Department of the Municipal Hospitaal of Mbanza Kongo, stated
that 379 measles cases had been admitted since the beginning of
August, 262 of whom were children under 5 years old.

In view of this situation the hospital had been obliged to transfer
patients with other illnesses to the Provincial Hospital, and to
reserve a ward for the treatment of measles patients. At the present
time 23 measles patients, comprising 2 adults and 21 children, are
receiving treatment.

Measles outbreak in Moyo
------------------------
A four-year-old boy in Moyo District has been confirmed as having
measles and his one-year old sister, also showing signs of the
disease. Moyo was among 14 districts identified with prevalence of the
disease. However, health workers in Gimara Sub-county where the case
was confirmed, say the family of the boy has moved to Jinja District.

The district disease surveillance officer, Mr Simon Amudra, said
measles can affect people of any age group but it is more severe among
children under five because they have low body immunity. Health
officials said if the disease spreads, it would become unmanageable
because the district lacks drugs for managing the symptoms.

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease which can be prevented
through vaccination. “We don’t have drugs for treating measles but
we only manage the signs and symptoms,” Mr Amudra said. The district
health officer, Dr Jimmy Opigo, said there is a need to vaccinate all
the children in the district below the age of five to prevent further
infections.

[5] Canada (MMR vaccine reactions)

Measles vaccine reactions usually mild
--------------------------------------
Reactions to the first shot of combined measles, mumps and rubella
[MMR] vaccine are common among young children, but serious reactions
are actually rare, a new study looking at data from Ontario suggests.

The study found that about one in 168 toddlers who got the 12-month
MMR shot was taken to hospital in the four-to-12-day period after
getting the shot. While records indicate most were suffering from real
symptoms of illness, such as fever, few were sick enough to require
hospitalization.

The lead author of the study interprets the findings this way: The
spike in hospital visits about a week after vaccination means the
vaccine was doing its job. "This is the vaccine working," said Dr.
Kumanan Wilson, a researcher with the Ottawa Hospital Research
Institute who has done a number of studies looking at parental
attitudes towards vaccination. "It's expected and necessary. This is
the immune system working." The study was published Tuesday in the
journal PLoS One, a journal of the U.S. Public Library of Science.

The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine is made with live but weakened
[attenuated] viruses. It's known that live-virus vaccines tend to
induce more short-term reactions in the period after vaccinations than
inactivated vaccines. Those reactions include fever and flu-like
symptoms.

Wilson's team used administrative data in Ontario to study the
question. They took data on more than 271 495 kids who got the
12-month shot and 184 312 children who got the MMR booster shot at 18
months and compared it to hospital visits data. They found that in the
period four to 12 days after the 12-month vaccinations -- especially
eight to 12 days after a shot -- there was a spike in hospital visits
for symptoms commonly seen after vaccinations. There was not a
statistically significant increase in children being admitted to
hospital as a result of those emergency department visits, however.

The same trend was not seen with the 18-month booster shot, but that
was no surprise. The first exposure to the vaccine virus -- the
12-month shot -- would be expected to produce the greatest response,
Wilson suggested.

Because they were working from data, not individual case reports, the
researchers cannot say with certainty that reactions to the
vaccination were what sent these children to hospital. But the large
sample size and the pattern seen is suggestive.

Wilson suggested more work may be needed on communicating to parents
what to expect in a child who is getting the first shot of MMR vaccine
at 12 months. "The MMR vaccine is a very important vaccine. Measles is
a highly infectious condition and you need a highly effective vaccine.
And it's been proven to be very safe. But we know that people are
quite anxious about this vaccine," Wilson said. There have long been
claims the MMR vaccine is linked to autism but multiple studies have
refuted that there is any association between the two.

Outbreak of Measles in a community of Pastaza (Amazona, Equador)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Health authorities have declared a quarantine area around Kapawi.
At least 300 indigenous Achuar have not been able to move from their
town [Kapawi] to other communities. Carlos Vimos, Head of Epidemology
in Pastaza says that those people living in Kapawi cannot leave to go
to Puyo or move to other communities until the infectious period for
measles is ended.

6 cases have been registered: 4 adults and 2 children

Auckland area hit by many measles cases
---------------------------------------
Health authorities are urging Aucklanders to ensure they are fully
protected against measles before they go on holiday. Some 372
confirmed and probable cases of the highly infectious disease have
been notified in Auckland since 30 May 2011, with 64 people requiring
hospitalisation.

Measles' symptoms include fever, cough, runny or blocked nose, sore
red eyes and white spots inside the mouth, with a rash appearing on
the face and spreading down the body after three to five days.

Dr Stuart Jenkins, clinical director of primary care at Auckland and
Waitemata District Health Boards, says the risk of measles spreading
further is likely to increase over the holiday season, as people
travel away from the city and large gatherings and celebrations
occur.

"We have seen some encouraging results in the increased uptake of the
measles, mumps and rubella vaccine to curb the spread of measles. "But
there is still an outbreak in the Auckland region, and people need to
continue to be vigilant. "We would urge everyone to check that their
own and their family's immunisations are up to date before they go on
holiday, or catch up with family in other parts of the country." The
best protection against measles is to have two doses of the MMR
vaccine. The vaccine is available free to all those who need it.
"Anyone who is unsure of their immunisation status should talk to
their GP clinic about getting vaccinated as soon as possible.

"This will ensure their Christmas holiday plans are not disrupted by
measles," Dr Jenkins says. Visit the website <www.healthpoint.co.nz >
