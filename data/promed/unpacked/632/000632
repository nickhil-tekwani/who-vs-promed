My mother just returned from a trip to Alaska on the [name of cruise liner
deleted - Mod.JW].

She became ill and now has high fever and pneumonia. The doctor is
currently waiting for the results of a blood test to determine if it could
be Legionnaire's disease.
Have you heard of the disease on this ship?

Many staff and about 15 people from her senior citizens group were ill.
-------------------------------------------
I have requested further information on this matter.
