[37 ASF outbreaks have been officially reported in Russia since the
beginning of the current epizootic in September 2009. An interactive
map with all accumulated foci, marked differentially for domestic
swine and wild boars, is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8462>.

The previous, initial ASF epizootic in Russia had started in Chechnya
on 5 Nov 2007, spread to neighbouring regions, and was declared
resolved on 1 Jun 2009. A map of all foci during the said period is
available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=6546>.

In fact, both epizootics can be regarded as one single ongoing event,
and apparently as part of the ASF Caucasian panzootic, which had
initially started in Georgia in April 2007 or earlier.
