Tests for anthrax poisoning on a heroin user who was suspected of
having the condition have proved negative. The patient, who was
admitted to Carlisle's Cumberland Infirmary on Christmas Day, has
skin lesions, a typical symptom of the condition.

It is feared that contaminated batches of the drug are in circulation
after 2 anthrax deaths in Scotland. A spokesman for NHS Cumbria said
initial tests on the patient had not shown the presence of the
disease. Dr John Ashton, director of public health at NHS Cumbria,
said: "This is encouraging news, but injecting drug users in Cumbria
should not let their guard down. Anyone who injects drugs and
experiences any unusual symptoms such as swelling or pain at the
injection site should seek medical help immediately, as anthrax can be lethal."

[Earlier reports were suggesting that it might have been cutaneous
anthrax, similar to the Scottish cases. The good news is that the
civil authorities are very aware of the risk of anthrax in the heroin
users presenting themselves at hospital emergency clinics. This will
increase the probability of any new cases being found (and treated)
and additional evidence as to the nature of the source collected. - Mod.MHJ]
