The outbreak of livestock rabies in the region of Montes de Maria has
been controlled
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Bolivar Secretariat of Health and the Colombian Agricultural
Institute (ICA) said they were taking all measures to prevent the
spread of the disease [rabies].

The disease was detected in the rural locality of San Cayetano (San
Juan Nepomuceno), and adjacent areas, in the Montes de Maria region.

According to the coordinator of the Zoonosis Unit of the Departmental
[State] Secretariat of Health , Orlando Paz Canadas, "the
confirmation and control of the outbreak took place last weekend
[18-19 Oct 2008], when bovines from 4 farms in the zone, located on
the borders of San Cayetano and Mahates, presented symptoms
consistent with rabies."

A report by the Interior ministry indicated that the transmission of
the sylvan rabies detected was attributed to attacks by the
well-known vampire bats (_Desmodus rotundus_), which were responsible
for another rabies outbreak in bovines about 2 years ago, and that
was also controlled through actions of the ICA and the Departmental
Secretariat of Health.

The secretariat has provided anti-rabies treatment for humans to 6
people who were exposed to infected cattle [sic], and at the same
time gave talks on the disease [rabies] to the community of the
affected zone.

The Health Secretary Eduardo Espinosa Faciolince, asked farmers from
the areas of endemic bovine sylvan rabies to vaccinate their
livestock in a timely manner with the rabies vaccine, in order to
avoid transmission of this disease, which in Bolivar Department is
present in various municipalities, especially in Santa Catalina,
Clemencia, Turbaco, Turbana, Mahates, Maria la Baja, San Juan
Nepomuceno, and El Carmen de Bolivar in the northern and in central
regions of the department, and other [municipalities] in the south of
the Department such as Rio Viejo, Regidor, Montecristo, Arenal, and
Norosi. [In Colombia, departments are state or province equivalents.

[One doesn't hear of rabid cows biting people, but exposure can occur.
With the pharyngeal paralysis that rabid cows have, they may behave
as though they have something caught in their throats, and there
examples of farmers and vets (and vet students) trying to get that
something out by reaching down the throat. What is stuck in their
throats is, of course, rabies virus.

The site mentioned in this article is hilly, not mountainous, but
there is a large forested area to the southwest of San Juan
Nepomuceno, adjacent to pastures, where the vampires are likely
hanging out.

Vampire bats are distributed in tropical areas of the Western
Hemisphere from Argentina to Mexico, and have been responsible for
transmitting rabies virus most frequently to cattle and equine
animals, and infrequently to humans [by bite]. Of the 3 vampire bat
species, _Desmodus rotundus_ is by far the most common rabies virus
transmitter.

There are 2 options for rabies control in these situations --
vaccination of animals upon which the vampire bats feed, or reduction
of the vampire bat populations. Vaccination of vampire bat hosts is
the fastest and most effective approach when vampire bat-transmitted
rabies appears in an area. In areas where repeated vampire
bat-transmitted rabies occurs, control of these bats has been
employed in some countries. Controlling vampire bats by eliminating
their roosts is extremely difficult because these roosts can be hard
to find. Effective vampire bat control has been accomplished by
capturing bats in mist nets when they come to feed on livestock, and
applying anticoagulant jelly (warfarin and similar products), which
they and their roost-mates ingest on grooming, or by intraruminal
[into the stomach] injection of these compounds in cattle, achieving
blood levels sufficient to kill the bats without harm to the treated
cattle.
