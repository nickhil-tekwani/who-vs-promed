India's daily COVID-19 cases jumped well past 200 000 today [13 Jan 2022], reaching the highest levels since last spring [2021], as some countries in Europe that were affected early by the omicron (B.1.1.529) variant considered easing some restrictions.

India's cases have risen 30-fold in a month, fueled by the highly transmissible omicron variant, with the virus spreading in all states and Mumbai and Delhi as major hot spots, according to Reuters (https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-daily-covid-19-cases-rise-by-247417-highest-since-may-2022-01-13/). The country has been bracing for another wave of COVID-19 activity after its catastrophic delta surge. So far, the country is reporting fewer hospitalizations and deaths, similar to omicron patterns in other countries.

Health officials in India have eased some COVID-19 rules, such as mandatory testing for most contacts, in an effort to concentrate resources on the highest-risk groups and to ease the burden on healthcare facilities, according to an analysis from Reuters (https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-new-covid-19-rules-aim-free-up-resources-carry-risks-2022-01-13/).

Though much of Europe is in the midst of intense COVID-19 surges, with activity moving from west to east, some earlier affected countries are considering easing some restrictions. The Netherlands, which went on lockdown before Christmas to curb the spread of the virus, said some nonessential businesses will be able to reopen on a limited basis starting on 15 Jan 2022, and colleges will reopen. Pressure on hospitals has improved, but brisk COVID-19 activity is still underway.

Elsewhere, Denmark's government yesterday [12 Jan 2022] announced that COVID-19 restrictions will begin easing tomorrow [14 Jan 2022], with the reopening of movie theaters and music venues, amid declining hospital rates, according to Reuters (https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/denmark-ease-coronavirus-restrictions-despite-omicron-surge-2022-01-12/). Also, the country joined a small group of nations recommending 4th COVID-19 vaccine doses for people at high risk for illness complications.

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/01/studies-covid-vaccines-effective-limited-waning


A trio of new studies yesterday [12 Jan 2022] in the New England Journal of Medicine report encouraging results on the effectiveness and durability of protection of COVID-19 vaccines against hospitalization and death, including teens.

One study, led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) COVID-19 Response Team, involved 445 hospitalized COVID-19 patients 12-18 years old and 777 uninfected matched controls at 31 hospitals in 23 states from 1 Jul 2021 to 25 Oct 2021, after the emergence of the delta (B1617.2) variant (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2117995). Seventeen case patients (4%) and 282 controls (36%) had received 2 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.

Among case patients, 180 (40%) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and 127 (29%) needed life support. Of all ICU patients, only 2 were fully vaccinated. Overall vaccine effectiveness (VE) against hospitalization was 94% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90-96).

Among uninfected controls with COVID-like symptoms, VE was 95% (95% CI, 91-97), while it was 94% (95% CI, 89-96) among uninfected controls with no symptoms. VE was 98% against ICU admission and 98% against requiring life support. Seven patients died, and 13 required extracorporeal membrane oxygen, all of whom were unvaccinated.

Three-quarters of the COVID-19 patients had underlying chronic illnesses, and nearly half were Black or Hispanic (24% and 25%, respectively).

On 22 Oct 2021, the researchers published interim findings from the study showing 93% VE for the Pfizer vaccine against COVID-related hospitalization among 179 case patients aged 12-18 years at 19 sites in 16 states (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7042e1.htm).

Of the current study, the authors said, "In this real-world evaluation of the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in adolescents between 12 and 18 years of age in the United States, when the delta variant was predominant, we found that the vaccine was highly effective against COVID-19 hospitalization and critical illness, including among patients with underlying risk factors for severe illness. Vaccination averted nearly all life-threatening COVID-19 illness in this age group."

In a related editorial, Kathryn Edwards, MD, of Vanderbilt University Medical Center, noted that as of 1 Dec 2021, only 15% of US children aged 5-11 years had received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose, a figure that contrasts sharply to the 95% vaccine uptake of routine pediatric vaccines (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2118471). By 23 Dec 2021, more than 7.5 million US children had been infected, and 721 had died, she added.

"Vigorous efforts must be expended to improve vaccination coverage among all children and especially among those at highest risk for severe COVID-19," Edwards wrote. "The highly effective surveillance network that is described in this study must also continue to monitor hospitalization data over time to assess waning of immunity, protection against new variants of concern (particularly the rapidly spreading B.1.1.529 [omicron] variant), and the need for and timing of additional vaccine doses."

A study led by United Kingdom Health Security Agency researchers assessed the effectiveness of the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines among COVID-19 patients in England from 8 Dec 2020 to 1 Oct 2021, a period marked by the emergence of delta (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2115481).

Of 7 106 982 COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results within 10 days of symptom onset, 6 056 673 were linked to the National Immunisation Management System. A total of 1 706 743 people tested positive for COVID-19 during the study period, of whom 544 468 were infected with the alpha (B117) variant, 1 125 257 were infected with the delta variant, and 37 018 had another or unknown variant.

The researchers also assessed 4 349 930 negative tests from 3 763 690 participants, of whom 510 177 had 2 negative results, and 76 063 had 3 negative results more than 7 days after a previous negative test.

Overall, 2 376 037 participants (39.2%) had received 2 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, and 2 133 769 (35.2%) had received 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine. A total of 22 575 participants were hospitalized with COVID-19 within 14 days after the test, and 6336 died within 28 days.

VE against symptomatic disease caused by the delta variant peaked in the early weeks after the 2nd dose, then declined by 20 weeks to 44.3% (95% CI, 43.2-45.4) for AstraZeneca and 66.3% (95% CI, 65.7-66.9) for Pfizer.

Waning VE against infection with symptoms was greater in patients 65 years and older than in those 40-64. VE against hospitalization with infection with the delta variant was 80.0% (95% CI, 76.8-82.7) with AstraZeneca and 91.7% (95% CI, 90.2-93.0) with Pfizer 20 weeks or more after vaccination. Similarly, VE against death due to the delta variant for the AstraZeneca vaccine was 84.8% (95% CI, 76.2-90.3) and 91.9% for Pfizer (95% CI, 88.5-94.3).

"Our data provide evidence of waning of protection against symptomatic infection after the receipt of 2 doses of the [AstraZeneca] or [Pfizer] vaccine from 10 weeks after receipt of the 2nd dose," the study authors wrote. "Protection against hospitalization and death, however, was sustained at high levels for at least 20 weeks after receipt of the 2nd dose."

An observational study led by University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (NCCH) researchers involved mining data on COVID-related outcomes and vaccination with the Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccines from 11 Dec 2020 to 8 Sep 2021, for about 10.6 million state residents (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2117128).

Two months after receipt of the 1st Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine dose, estimated VE against symptomatic or asymptomatic infection was 94.5% (95% CI, 94.1-94.9) and 95.9% (95% CI, 95.5-96.2), respectively, declining to 66.6% (95% CI, 65.2-67.8) and 80.3% (95% CI, 79.3-81.2), respectively, by 7 months.

Estimated VE among patients who received the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine early fell by roughly 15 and 10 percentage points, respectively, from mid-June to mid-July [2021], when the delta variant became dominant.

Among recipients of the one-dose J&J vaccine, VE against infection was 74.8% (95% CI, 72.5-76.9) at 1 month, dropping to 59.4% (95% CI, 57.2-61.5) at 5 months.

VE against hospitalization or death after 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine peaked at 96.4% (95% CI, 95.1-97.4) at 2 months and was still at 88.7% (95% CI, 86.9-90.3) at 7 months. Moderna 2-dose effectiveness peaked at 97.2% (95% CI, 96.1-98.0) at 2 months and was still 94.1% (95% CI, 92.7-95.2) at 7 months. VE of the J&J vaccine peaked at 85.8% (95% CI, 74.9-91.9) at 2 months and remained higher than 80% through 6 months.

All 3 vaccines were better at preventing hospitalization and death over time than at preventing infection, although the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines offered more protection than J&J. The researchers said the results suggest that waning immunity is leading to breakthrough COVID-19 infections, but vaccines maintained effectiveness against hospitalization and severe disease 9 months after the 1st injection.

"Unlike previous studies, we estimated the vaccine effectiveness in reducing the current risks of COVID-19, hospitalization and death as a function of time elapsed since the 1st dose," lead author Dan-Yu Lin, PhD, said in an NCCH press release. "This information is critically important in determining the need for and the optimal timing of booster vaccination" (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/939989).

[3] Updates
Date: Thu 13 Jan 2022
Source: Al Jazeera [abridged, edited]
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/1/13/covid-omicron-vaccine-pass-liveblog


France will no longer require proof of an essential reason for travellers from the United Kingdom and will lift a requirement to self-isolate upon arrival. Meanwhile, teachers launched a strike over the government's "chaotic" virus strategy for schools and the Senate approved a controversial vaccine pass to access public places.

Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said it will consider whether to extend a global public health emergency it declared over the coronavirus, which has been in place for nearly 2 years.

Also, the Africa Centres for Disease Control is seeking to work with Pfizer to bring its treatment pill for COVID-19 to the continent, where less than 15% of the population has received at least one dose of the vaccine.

Here are the latest updates:

- Germany's STIKO vaccine committee recommended that all children between the ages of 12 and 17 receive a booster shot as the country reported a new daily record of more than 81 000 infections. The move on booster shots makes Germany among the 1st countries in the world to make such a recommendation, following the United States, Israel and Hungary.

The 3rd dose should be an mRNA shot from BioNTech/Pfizer and should be given, at the earliest, 3 months after the child had their 2nd shot, the committee said in a statement. While data on the effectiveness and safety of the booster vaccination for 12-17-year-olds remains limited, the risk of severe side effects is estimated to be very low, it added.

- US President Joe Biden is directing the government to procure an additional 500 million COVID-19 tests to help meet surging demand across the country, a White House official told Reuters. The order comes on top of another 500 million tests that the White House pledged would be available to Americans in January [2022].

- Coronavirus restrictions in the Netherlands will be eased from Saturday [15 Jan 2022] despite omicron, Dutch media reported. Nonessential stores, hairdressers and gyms will be allowed to reopen for a limited number of customers, broadcasters NOS and RTL said, citing government sources. Students will be welcomed back to their colleges and universities. Bars, restaurants, theatres, museums and other public places will remain closed.

- More US medical teams to bolster states as omicron surges: Another 1000 federal health workers are deploying to 6 states to help alleviate overwhelmed hospitals amid the US surge in omicron-related cases, the White House said. The teams of between 7 and 25 military doctors, nurses and other personnel will head to New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Rhode Island, Michigan and New Mexico to support emergency departments and allow hospital staff to continue with other care, a White House official said.

- The African continent has exceeded 10 million confirmed COVID-19 cases as the world enters the 3rd year of the pandemic, according to the WHO. Speaking at a virtual panel, the UN agency's Regional Emergency Director Abdou Salam Gueye said "more than 230 000 people have sadly died" in Africa so far. Death rates have risen by 64% during the past week "mainly due to infection among people at high risk," but deaths and hospitalisations remain low compared with previous virus waves on the continent.

Africa has received more than 660 million doses of vaccines, with only about 340 million doses administered so far.

- Tokyo has recorded a new 4-month high in COVID-19 infections, and experts forecast the spread of the omicron variant will cause the daily count to triple by month's end [January 2022]. Omicron now accounts for more than 80% of new infections in Japan, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told reporters.

Japan's capital had 3124 new coronavirus cases, the most since 1 Sep 2021. The daily tally will likely exceed 10 000 by the end of January [2022], according to projections announced at a municipal government meeting.

- Hungary is to make a 4th shot available to people who ask for it, Prime Minister Viktor Orban's chief of staff, Gergely Gulyas, told a news conference. The European Union's drug regulator has expressed doubts about the need for a 4th dose and said there were no data to support this approach as it seeks more information on the fast-spreading variant. Chile and Israel have already begun a rollout.

- Poorer nations last month [December 2021] rejected more than 100 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines distributed under the global programme COVAX, mainly due to their rapid expiry date, a UNICEF official said. "More than 100 million have been rejected just in December alone," Etleva Kadilli, director of supply division at UN agency UNICEF told lawmakers at the European Parliament. Supplies have also been rejected because of insufficient storage facilities, Kadilli said, including a lack of fridges for vaccines.

-A "shocking" surge in COVID-19 cases across the WHO's Eastern Mediterranean region is probably due to the omicron variant, a WHO official said, warning that some countries in the group still have very low vaccination rates. Reported cases in the region rose 89% in the 1st week of January [2022] from a week earlier but deaths fell by 13%, WHO Regional Director Ahmed al-Mandhari said.

Out of 22 mostly Middle Eastern countries in the region, 15 have officially reported cases of the highly infectious omicron variant. Al-Mandhari said 6 countries in the region -- Afghanistan, Djibouti, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen -- have vaccinated less than 10% of their populations despite having enough vaccines available to protect up to 40%.

- A South African pulmonologist said unvaccinated patients are still contracting severe COVID-19 disease, despite evidence suggesting the omicron coronavirus causes milder symptoms. "We are still seeing very serious infections and admissions in patients who are unvaccinated and also in patients who have comorbidities, and this includes the elderly population," pulmonologist Anita Graham told a news conference organised by the WHO's Africa office.

- Finland has cut the length of its COVID quarantine from 10 days to 5 for most cases, its public health authority said. With the omicron variant, "the progress of infection development has speeded up and therefore the quarantine length of 10 days is no longer justifiable the way it was before," public health authority THL's chief physician Otto Helve told reporters.

Finland reported 53 600 new COVID cases over a week, up by more than 27% from the week before, but authorities said the numbers were no longer reliable due to a lack of testing capacity.

- Africa's top public health body is in talks with Pfizer about bringing its treatment pill for COVID-19 to the continent, its director said. "We are in really close discussions with Pfizer to see what can be done to make the drugs available on the continent and accessible on the continent," said John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control.

- The emirate of Ajman has warned government employees that they will be penalised for coming into contact for a 2nd time with anyone who has contracted COVID-19, UAE media have reported. Federal employees in Ajman will not receive paid sick leave for quarantine if they come into close contact with infected people outside the workplace or home for a 2nd time.

Ajman's human resources department has issued a circular with a list of infractions that would lead to salary deductions, ranging from a one-day pay cut to a 10-day pay cut for repeat offenders. The list includes failure to wear masks, being in crowded areas, shaking hands with others and going to the office after being in contact with someone who has contracted the coronavirus.

- Indian cities could see new COVID-19 infections peak next week, experts said, as the country reported the highest number of daily cases since late May [2021]. Total infections have reached 36.32 million, behind only the United States.

"Our modelling, and those of others, suggests that the big Indian cities should see their peaks in cases close to 20 Jan [2022], while the overall peak in India may be shifted a bit later, to early February," said Gautam Menon, professor of physics and biology at Ashoka University.

- South Korea will become the 1st Asian country to treat coronavirus patients with Pfizer's antiviral pills starting on Friday [14 Jan 2022]. Some 630 000 Paxlovid pills, enough for 21 000 people, have arrived and will be distributed to 280 pharmacies and 90 residential treatment centres, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) said.

"In light of Omicron's much higher infectiousness, the medication should play a meaningful role in restraining the number of patients who would develop critical symptoms even if the strain is relatively less severe," Kim Ki-nam, a KDCA official, told a briefing.

- France has announced it was slightly easing COVID-19 protocols for travellers from Britain, saying that the proof of an essential reason for the trip and a requirement to self-isolate upon arrival would no longer be required. The requirement for a negative COVID-19 test, conducted 24 hours before a trip, remains in place.

- Preliminary data suggest booster generates higher antibodies: AstraZeneca said data from a trial it conducted on its COVID-19 vaccine, Vaxzevria, showed it generated a higher antibody response against omicron and other strains when given as a 3rd booster dose. The increased response was seen in people who were previously vaccinated with either Vaxzevria or an mRNA vaccine, the drugmaker said, adding that it would submit these data to regulators worldwide given the urgent need for boosters.

- WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic told Al Jazeera that attention on the spread of the new coronavirus variant must remain high, dismissing recent calls to debate the possibility of treating COVID-19 as an endemic illness akin to the flu. "50 000 deaths a week is not something we can just accept," Jasarevic said, adding that while the quarantine period can be reduced provided adequate testing, measures including wearing masks in public places must be upheld.

Jasarevic said more efforts must be made to reach the unvaccinated, especially in the 36 countries that have vaccinated less than 10% of their total population. "We really need to close the gap in vaccination," Jasarevic said.

- France has approved new measures to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, including the requirement for residents to prove their vaccination status to access restaurants and bars, cultural venues, or interregional public transport. The Senate backed the legislation for a COVID vaccine pass by 249 in favour, versus 63 against. The legislation had already been approved earlier this month [January 2022] by France's lower house of parliament.

The proposal encountered some opposition among the public after President Emmanuel Macron told Le Parisien paper that he wanted to "p*** off" unvaccinated people by making their lives so complicated they would get the COVID vaccine.

- Cannabis compounds may prevent COVID, study says: A new laboratory study says cannabis compounds show the ability to prevent the virus that causes COVID-19 from entering human cells. Researchers from the Oregon State University in the United States said they found that a pair of cannabinoid acids -- called cannabigerolic acid or CBGA and cannabidiolic acid or CBDA -- can bind to the spike proteins on the SARS-CoV-2, blocking a critical step in the process the virus uses to infect people. The study was published in the Journal of Natural Products (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.1c00946).

- The White House says it will increase federal support for COVID-19 testing in schools in order to keep them open amid the omicron surge. Jeff Zientis, the White House's COVID-19 response coordinator, said a dedicated stream of 5 million rapid tests and 5 million lab-based PCR tests will be made available to schools starting this month [January 2022]. The initiative comes after Chicago public schools closed for days amid an impasse between teachers and officials over reopening policies.

- The Australian state of Victoria is exempting more workers from quarantine requirements for being close contacts. The decision came amid pressure on supply chains and will apply to staff in emergency services, education, and transport.

Australia is reporting its biggest caseload since the pandemic began, logging more than 147 000 new cases on Thursday [13 Jan 2022]. A total of 53 deaths were also reported, but the death rate during the omicron wave is lower than prior outbreaks in Australia.

More than 92% of people above the age of 16 are double-dosed in the country. Net new hospital admissions and people admitted to intensive care are at their highest in the pandemic, but authorities say the health systems can cope with the rising cases.

- The Pan American Health Organization says it expects omicron to become the predominant coronavirus variant in the Americas in the coming weeks. "While delta is still causing new infections in the Americas, based on current trends, omicron is on track to become the dominant strain in our region," said Carissa Etienne, director of the agency known by its initials, PAHO. The omicron variant, which spreads more easily, has been detected in 42 of the 56 countries and territories of the Americas.

- With the help of an independent committee of experts, the WHO will consider later on Thursday [13 Jan 2022] whether to extend a global public health emergency it declared over the coronavirus. The current "public health emergency of international concern" has been in place for nearly 2 years now.

Whether the committee recommends declaring the coronavirus emergency over or not, there would be few practical consequences. However, many experts are concerned that ending it could send the wrong signal as cases surge across the globe.

[In the past 24 hours, 38 countries, including the USA (891 781), France (305 322), India (269 643), Italy (184 577), Spain (159 161), Australia (137 459), Argentina (128 402), the UK (105 679), Brazil (97 221), Germany (93 154), Turkey (75 564), Peru (61 132), Israel (59 333), Mexico (43 523), Portugal (40 134), Belgium (39 321), Philippines (33 775), Netherlands (33 344), Switzerland (32 804), Canada (31 144), Colombia (30 283), Japan (30 183), Sweden (25 567), Ecuador (24 480), Denmark (23 929), Russia (21 155), Greece (20 409), Poland (16 874), Viet Nam (16 725), Switzerland (24 445), Ireland (18 904), Austria (15 852), Finland (14 277), Bolivia (14 160), Serbia (13 753), Norway (11 597), Czech Republic (11 524), and Ukraine (10 046), reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 8862 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 11 Jan 2022 to late 12 Jan 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last few weeks can be attributed to the rapid spread of the omicron variant globally. The 7-day averages indicate an increasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 74 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 40 of the 74 countries are from the European region, 8 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 from the South-East Asia region, and 11 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 46.8%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 11.1%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 35.7% increase in daily reported cases and a 37.5% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily report counted over 3.41 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 320.95 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.53 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
