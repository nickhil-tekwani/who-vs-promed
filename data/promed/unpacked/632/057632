Physicians from an infectious clinical hospital have reported the 1st
case of tularemia in Moscow in 2008. A 53-year-old Muscovite had
acquired tularemia in Naro-Fominsk, a Moscow suburban area, where he
was on vacation in the country. For several days he fished and
collected mushrooms. Symptoms of the infection began on 26 Jun 2008
with fever and groin swelling. Self-treatment had no success.

In the hospital his illness was suspected as tularemia and the
diagnosis was confirmed.

[Tularemia is endemic, not emerging, in the region, but is reported here
because it is listed as a Schedule A potential bioterror agent. There
is, of course, no suggestion that this case was due to bioterrorism.

Periodically tularemia is observed in the European part of Russia.
The most significant outbreak was recorded in 2005 in the Nizhny
Novgorod, Voronezh, Moscow, and Vladimir regions. In total 334 people
were hospitalized with symptoms of tularemia. The disease was
laboratory confirmed in 128 cases -- see ProMED refs. below. - Mod.NP

The glandular (or ulceroglandular if an ulcer was present distally)
tularemia may have been acquired from an exposure to a [wild] animal
[such as a rabbit or hare] during his vacation, from [contaminated]
water, or via an arthropod bite.
