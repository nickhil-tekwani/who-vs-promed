Polio cases rise to 50 this year [2006] in Bihar
-----------------------------------------------
Despite umpteen [many] rounds of the pulse polio immunization program
in the state, 2 fresh cases of poliomyelitis were reported in Bihar
last week. With this, the total number of children afflicted with the
debilitating disease in the State rose to 50 this year [2006]. The
figure in 2005 was 30.
The 2 new cases were detected in East Champaran and Sitamarhi. What
has worried doctors is that both the kids had been administered polio
drops more than 4 times. Other children who were afflicted with the
disease this year [2006] had also been immunized against the virus.
When contacted, state immunization officer Dr. Gopal Krishna
confirmed the development and said that medical officers of the
districts concerned were trying to find out the causes that led to
the new cases. "Maybe the immunity level of the children was low," he added.
8 rounds of the PPI program had been carried out in the current year
[2006]. With 50 cases of poliomyelitis, Bihar ranks next to Uttar
Pradesh, where 501 patients were detected this year [2006] alone.
The other cases were reported from Haryana (16), Uttaranchal (13),
Punjab (7), Maharashtra (5), Gujarat (3), Madhya Pradesh (3), Assam
(2) and one each reported from Chandigarh, Himachal Pradesh, West
Bengal & Jharkhand.

[According to the most recent information on the polio eradication
website, there have been 597 cases of polio confirmed in India as of
19 Dec 2006, as compared with 57 cases reported during the same
period in 2005 (see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp>).
From the above newswire, the information on the vaccination
histories of the newest cases as having had 4 or more prior doses of
polio vaccine raises concerns as to possible reasons for the vaccine
failures. The most disconcerting of the possible explanations is that
there may have been a break in the cold chain, leading to a loss of
potency of the vaccine administered. The oral polio vaccine (OPV),
which is used in the vaccination activities in most countries in the
world, is made of attenuated live polioviruses (types 1, 2 and 3).
This vaccine is heat labile so that storage at ambient temperatures
can lead to a loss of potency, as the vaccine viruses die when kept
at temperatures above 8 C for prolonged periods. Vaccines are to be
stored and transported at temperatures lower than 8 C at all times
through a logistical system referred to as the cold chain. A break in
the cold chain could result in the administration of many doses of
vaccine that have lost their potency. Other possible reasons for
vaccine failure in a child could be concurrent infection with other
enteroviruses at the time of receipt of the vaccine, so that
intestinal receptor sites are unavailable to the vaccine virus. This
latter reason is more of a challenge to deal with, as many of these
children are not brought for routine vaccination activities and are
only reached during specified times when there are vaccination
campaign activities.
More information on the investigations into the epidemiology of these
cases in India would be appreciated.

Bangladesh to immunize 24 million children against polio
-----------------------------------------------
Bangladesh is immunizing 24 million children today [23 Dec 2006] in a
bid to eradicate polio from the country.
It is the 6th national immunization day in Bangladesh. It was
declared polio-free in the year 2000 by the World Health
Organization, but 17 cases have been reported recently. To stamp out
this incurable disease, Bangladesh is fighting hard to become a
polio-free nation again.
A 2-year-old boy in a village near Sylhet, 350 km northeast of the
capital, Dhaka, was found to have the virus.
One of the medical officers in Sylhet said that the Dhaka-based
National Polio Laboratory has confirmed the case.
This case was reported in March this year [2006], triggering national
alarm and the introduction of a wide scale vaccination program.
The Bangladesh government started immunizing children under 5 years
against polio by launching a nationwide drive. It has appointed 60
medical experts to keep watch and take appropriate steps to monitor
and curb the disease. These officers are the representatives of
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and World Health Organization (WHO).
Medical officials in Bangladesh believe that the latest polio
epidemic may have originated from India, which reported 583 polio
cases in 2006.

[In the most recent available polio eradication website update (19 Dec 2006
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp#details>),
there is mention that: "Pre-notification of 2 new cases (type 1) was
received from Sylhet province. The cases had onset of paralysis on 29
Oct [2006] and 4 Nov [2006]. Bangladesh's most recent NIDs [National
Immunization Days] were conducted on 25 Nov [2006]. The next NIDs
will be launched on 23 Dec [2006]."
In an earlier report, genetic studies on earlier poliovirus isolates
in Bangladesh showed they were related to viruses circulating in
western Uttar Pradesh, India (see Poliomyelitis - Worldwide (04):
Bangladesh 20060316.0822 & Poliomyelitis - worldwide (04):
Bangladesh, correction 20060321.0873), hence, the statement in the
above newswire that the original reintroduction of polio into
Bangladesh was related to continued poliovirus circulation in
neighboring India.
The most recent update on numbers of reported cases of polio in
Bangladesh is 15 cases for 2006, as compared with no cases reported
in 2005 <http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp>.
The 2 additional cases mentioned in the "pre-notification report"
bring the total reported cases this year (2006) to 17. The obvious
concern is that local transmission of the wild poliovirus will
continue now that Bangladesh has been re-seeded with wild poliovirus.

According to the polio eradication website, as of 19 Dec 2006 there
have been 32 cases of polio confirmed in Somalia during 2006, as
compared with 101 cases confirmed in the same period in 2005. The
website also had the following "pre-notification" (not officially
reported to WHO as yet) information:
"Pre-notification of a case (type 1) was received from Togdher
province. The case had onset of paralysis on 8 Nov [2006]. Two NIDs
have been held since this latest case, in early November [2006] and
on 10 Dec [2006]. Somalia's next SNIDs will be held in early January [2007]."

[The above information on the polio activity in Somalia is not
surprising, given the reports of 2 recent cases of polio in Kenya
among residents of a Somalian refugee camp in Garissa, Kenya. ProMED
reported on the cases in the camp in prior postings (see
Poliomyelitis - Worldwide (15) & (19): Kenya ex Somalia -- see
below). As a reminder, genotyping of some of the earlier isolates
from Somalia and the isolate from the 1st confirmed case in a
Somalian refugee camp in Kenya revealed the origin of these viruses
to be Nigeria, where polio is still endemic.
