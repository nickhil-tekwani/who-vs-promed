Today Zulia State was declared in emergency by health authorities because
of the rise in cases of dengue fever and DHF. The second reported death in
the current outbreak occurred last Saturday in a 4 years old girl. The
first reported death occurred last December [1998.
In the first epidemiological week there were only 148 cases reported --
(302 for same [week last year versus 174 and 142 cases for the last two
weeks of 1998; [total of 892 cases reported in 1998). Of those reported,
122 are reported as classic dengue fever, and 26 as DHF. 108 cases are from
Zulia state capital (Maracaibo), with 19 DHF cases.
The results for the second week have not been displayed yet, but the
unofficial reports from medical personnel from the biggest hospitals are
that cases are on the rise faster each day. In one hospital 8 physicians
came down with dengue fever.
State authorities are restarting educational programs to inform people
without causing panic.
Last year [1998 there were 3257 cases reported in Caracas [the national
capital, with no deaths. 33654 cases with 43 deaths were reported in the
whole country in 1998. There is, as in many countries, a considerable
amount of underreporting.
