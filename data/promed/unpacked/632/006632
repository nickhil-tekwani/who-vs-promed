A comment on monitoring of aid workers for avian influenza
-----------------------------------------------
The terrible disaster affecting southeast Asia will certainly create
a number of public health challenges in the immediately affected
areas. However, there is the possibility that these events may lead
to a much larger pandemic influenza problem. The relief effort has
brought a number of people from around the globe to a region not only
affected by the tsunami but also affected by avian influenza. It is
possible that the [local] population in the area might have some
innate immunity due to repeated exposure to avian influenza. However,
with the influx of immune-naive foreign aid workers, there seems to
be a potential for spread into people who may be much more
susceptible. It is a safe assumption that hygienic conditions in the
area are going to be lacking for some time. In addition, many of
these workers might almost suspect that they will come down with an
illness because of the circumstances, and may simply shrug off the
1st signs and symptoms. As they return to their countries of origin,
they may unwittingly depart during the prodromal phase of illness
only to act as the index cases of pandemic flu in their countries.
It would be prudent for federal, state, and provincial public health
departments to set up surveillance systems to monitor the health of
individuals who traveled to help with the tsunami recovery efforts.

[In addition, the established AI surveillance and control
systems/activities in the poultry sector might suffer from the
aftermath of the current disaster. This relates particularly to
Indonesia and Thailand. - Mod.AS]
