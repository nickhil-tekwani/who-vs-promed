The booming Indian wine industry is facing a crisis with 2 deadly
viruses affecting farms across Maharashtra, which accounts for 94
percent of the country's wine production. While the viruses, blamed
on imported plants, were 1st detected in 2002, fresh cases have been
reported this year [2007].

The viruses, detected as leafroll and rugose wood complex, have
infected varieties like Chardonnay, Ugni Blanc, Pinot Noir, and
Vermentino, and also Merlot, Zinfandel, and Roussance imported from
France and Italy. With the Pune-based National Research Centre for
Grapes (NRC) confirming the presence of the diseases, the state
government has decided to stop import of plant material and [seek]
expert opinion. It is also holding a meeting on Monday [5 Nov 2007]
to address the concerns of the wine variety grape farmers.
Horticulture minister Vinay Kore said the government had taken
serious note of the "imported" viral diseases.

However, Chateau Indage, a major player in the domestic wine
industry, chose to downplay the incidence of the infection. "There is
no spread of virus by the imported plants. Virus could spread from
the indigenous rootstock and buds. There is no point in blaming the
imported material," said S G Chougale, chairman of Chateau Indage.

The NRC, which recommended that import of plant material be stopped
as of now, says that of 27 samples collected from across the state, 4
plants were detected to be having the viruses, mainly leafroll. The
NRC, which conducted tests in 2002 and again in September 2007, has
recommended that all imported varieties should carry certificates
from recognised authorities from the exporting countries and imported
plants be again tested and grown in protected conditions at least for 2 years.

"It is a sensitive matter as any misinformation or panic in farmers
will affect the prospect of the growing wine industry in
Maharashtra," says NRC director Dr P G Adsule. The concern is
understandable given that the Indian wine industry is growing at a
rate of 30 to 40 percent. The NRC report notes that initially,
imported material was grown only in close vicinity of wineries and
vineyards owned by firms such as Chateau Indage. "However, with the
introduction of contract farming, most wineries are importing
planting material," says the report.

"The virus bug will kill the industry," fears Ashok Gaikwad, who
has been in grape cultivation for more than a decade in Nashik, the
Napa Valley of Maharashtra. He suggests that instead of stopping
import of the plants, only the mother cane should be allowed to be
imported and then grafting could be done indigenously. Many other
farmers are concerned as well and want the state government to
tighten the prevailing quarantine system.

However, the NRC points out that ignoring the viruses will be more
harmful in the long run. "Not only will the vineyards be affected but
also the quality of wine will deteriorate, which will result in a
collapse of the industry. The grape varieties required for wines
cannot be developed in India and with demand growing, thousands of
plants are imported mainly from France, Italy, and Australia," notes
Dr S D Sawant, plant pathologist, NRC. NRC also believes that many
grape plants could be symptom-less carriers and points out that it
often takes a long time for these symptoms to appear.

There is another party to this controversy, and Dr Jayram Khilare,
president of the Maharashtra Grape Growers Association, fears that no
one is paying any attention to it. "We are not opposed to the wine
industry. But now with the wine varieties bringing in the viruses,
cultivation of even table grapes in the state is under a cloud. For
the last few months farmers across the state have been approaching us
complaining of leafroll symptoms," he says. Table grape is grown on
more than 2 lakh [200 000] acres [ca. 81 000 hectares] in the state,
Khilare adds.

[Grapevine leafroll is one of the most important viral diseases in
grapevines and occurs wherever grapevines are grown. At least 9
different grapevine leafroll associated viruses (GLRaVs) belonging to
different genera within the family _Closteroviridae_ have been
reported. Typical leafroll symptoms include downward rolling and
interveinal reddening or yellowing of leaves, reduced fruit size,
sugar content, and yield. GLRaV 3 is transmitted by a mealy bug,
while the natural vectors for the other GLRaVs are still unknown. All
of the GLRaVs are spread by grafting and have been widely distributed
and accumulated in their long-lived host over time by human activities.

Symptoms of viral leaf roll disease vary on different grape varieties
resulting in very serious disease in some varieties and no symptoms
at all in others. These latter 'latent' infections are a particular
threat as a source of diseased grafting material. Generic molecular
diagnostic methods for _Closteroviridae_ have been developed and can
be used to ensure virus-free rootstocks and budwood.

The causal agent of the rugose wood disease complex, which includes
corky bark, has been attributed to members of the genus _Vitivirus_,
such as _Grapevine virus A_ (GVA) and _Grapevine virus B_ (GVB). They
are spread by mechanical means, infected planting material and
grafting. GVB is transmitted in a semi-persistent manner by different
species of mealybugs (_Pseudococcus_ and _Planococcus_ species) and
is widely distributed.

Virus diseases can have a serious impact on vine health, yield, and
quality of the fruit. Symptoms are not always severe or obvious, but
even a small decrease in yield will add up over time causing
significant economic losses. Decreased yields of 5 to 10 percent are
not uncommon, and losses can be much higher. Viruses may also
influence wine quality by causing delays in sugar accumulation, poor
acid development, and poor colour development. The difficulty of
detecting virus infection can lead to rapid dissemination of
virus-infected material through propagation. When infected cuttings
are used for propagation, whole vineyards can become infected.

Although this report names only 2 diseases, leafroll and rugose wood,
each of these may be associated with several viruses. The total
number of viruses infecting these grapevines may therefore be higher.
Virus sources may be both local and introduced plant material, and
simply stopping all new plant imports will not solve the problem.
Virus-infected plants cannot be cured, only removed and replaced by
certified material. It is mandatory to test both rootstocks and
grafting material when establishing new plantings.
