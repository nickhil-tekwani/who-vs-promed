South Australia could be facing one of its worst cropping seasons for the
fungal disease stem rust. New strains of the disease have been found in
wheat plants from across the Eyre Peninsula and the southern half of the
Yorke Peninsula.
Hugh Wallwork of the South Australian Research and Development Institute
says wet conditions over summer helped the disease to thrive. "I think it
would be the most that I have come across in the last 20 years," he
said. "To have this much stem rust at this time of the year with a lot of
volunteers [plants] out in the field and looking like an early sowing
season, it's looking worse than it has for a long time."

[2] Expert Panel on Ug99 Outbreak in East Africa

Wheat ranks as a primary source of food and livelihood for hundreds of
millions of people globally, especially in developing countries. But
scientists are concerned that a newly discovered strain of one of the most
dangerous pathogens to affect wheat could cause a global food crisis. First
discovered in Uganda in 1999, Ug99 is a variant of the wheat pathogen known
as stem rust, and expectations are that it will spread from its origin in
eastern Africa to the rest of the wheat-growing world.
Over the past 150 years, stem rust pandemics have led to famines in India
and massive grain losses in North America.
Modern breeding methods, combined with free international exchange of
experimental wheat lines, have now led to the development and distribution
of wheat varieties that have the ability to resist rust.
An "Expert Panel on the Stem Rust Outbreak in East Africa," led by Dr.
Ronnie Coffman, evaluated the threat of the new wheat stem rust variant,
Ug99. Coffman presented the report of their study at a press conference
held in Nairobi last September [2005] a day before the Global Rust
Initiative (GRI) summit.
The Threat
-----
"It is only a matter of time until Ug99 reaches across the Saudi Arabian
peninsula into the Middle East, South Asia, and eventually East Asia and
the Americas," said Coffman.
Dr. Ravi Singh, a scientist working with the International Maize and Wheat
Improvement Center (CIMMYT), said that the disease was first discovered in
Uganda in 1999. It later appeared in Kenya in 2001 followed by Ethiopia in
2003, showing its devastating potential to spread and destroy.
Need for Global Action
------------------
According to Nobel Peace Prize winner Professor Norman Borlaug, "Without an
epidemic for the past 50 years, maybe we've become complacent."
Ug99 has so far survived attempts to curtail it, according to the panel of
experts. Since it is difficult to stop, the only option, especially for
small-scale farmers, is to identify and develop resistant strains,
explained Kiome, director of the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute.
A Global Rust Initiative (GRI) will have these recommendations as their
mandate, creating an international partnership led by the International
Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), the International Center for
Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA), the Kenyan Agricultural
Research Institute (KARI) and the Ethiopian Agricultural Research
Organization (EARO).
Among the measures recommended by the panel is the monitoring of wheat
populations by means of trap nurseries. These nurseries use wheat varieties
known to have resistant genes and test their reaction to rust disease. Data
obtained from the reaction of these resistant varieties is used to identify
the different forms of pathogen.
As the pathogen population changes itself to infect wheat cultivars with
different resistant genes, variations in the pathogen population must be
identified. This identification process must be done through race-analysis
for the Kenya-Ethiopia region, adjacent areas and beyond, according to the
panel.
Another recommendation is the establishment of warning systems based on
data using the Geographical Information System, which coordinates data
collected using satellite imagery and data collected at the fields.
The panel also recommended a breeding strategy that would incorporate
diverse genetic resistance to Ug99 into the modern cultivars currently
grown in North America and Asia before the new strain of pathogen migrates
to those areas. DNA-marker assisted selection should be used where feasible.
Chemical intervention for short-term control would be equally important in
curtailing the wheat disease, and should be employed by all producers,
according to the recommendations.
Seed multiplication agencies and community-based organizations should also
be encouraged to produce commercial seeds for the newly developed stem rust
resistant varieties.
Baseline studies need to be made in crops, both infected and not, and
impact studies carried out after the use of resistant varieties. Such
studies would have to take into consideration alternative crops and
livelihood systems, because of the socio-economic implications of the new
disease on wheat-producing countries.
Human resources need to be augmented through training programs. Advanced
degree training should be provided for people associated with the project,
in addition to in-country practical courses and specialized courses outside
the country.
Well-equipped laboratories and effective communication systems are also
needed to address the new threat. Facilities for wheat research should
therefore be established and strengthened in Ethiopia and Kenya.
Special support needs to be given to communication strategies to raise and
maintain awareness of the stem rust problem, while enhancing communication
among scientists and other concerned stakeholders
Appropriate advanced research institutes like the ones in North America and
Australia should be engaged in the GRI that utilize their own resources,
said the panel report. CIMMYT and ICARDA should receive additional
resources from advanced research institutes and other donors to coordinate
the GRI and meet their respective research responsibilities necessary to
avert an epidemic.
"For once, Africa can help the rest of the world," said Dr Marianne
Banzinger, the Director of CIMMYT's African Livelihoods Program. "There is
time to make a difference. This is a chance we cannot afford to miss."

[3] Wheat imports to India allowed

Expressing concern over the government's decision to import wheat after a
span of 7 years, eminent agriculture scientist M S Swaminathan has warned
against complacency in matters relating to food security.
"The decision to allow wheat import is a wake-up call that shows any
complacency will be disastrous for food and national security," Swaminathan
told PTI here.
Earlier this month [Feb 2006], the government decided to allow importation
of 5 lakh [one lakh is 100 000; so 5 lakh are 500 000] metric tons of wheat
to tide over the short supplies in Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh.
The import decision is also a "wake-up call" in the sense that there is no
point to relax at a time when stem rust such as the 'Ug 99' [strain] is
creating havoc to the wheat crop in Africa.
"We should take adequate safeguard against such stem rust which might
intrude into our country," he said.

[4] ARS, cooperators fight new Ug99 strain

Potential damage to African wheat from a new strain of wheat stem rust
could be avoided, thanks to research that Agricultural Research Service
(ARS) scientists have shared with researchers in East Africa.
Researchers have screened U.S. wheat varieties in Kenya for resistance to
Ug99, the most virulent new strain of wheat stem rust in 50 years. This
could help avoid a major threat to wheat growing there and around the world.
Leaders in wheat research from ARS and other organizations met at a Global
Rust Summit organized by Nobel Peace Prize winner and father of the "Green
Revolution" Norman Borlaug and held in Nairobi, Kenya, in September 2005,
to enlist aid to address the Ug99 problem. Ug99 was first found in Uganda
in 1999, but it has now spread to Kenya and Ethiopia, with the potential to
seriously damage wheat production.
M. Kay Simmons, ARS national program leader for grain crops, and A. Richard
Bennett, ARS national program leader for plant health, traveled to Africa
to contribute to the summit.
Even before the summit took place, a partnership of ARS, the Kenyan
Agricultural Research Institute and the International Maize and Wheat
Improvement Center began testing more than 800 U.S. wheat cultivars and
genetic resources in field trials in Kenya.
While most U.S. bread wheats are vulnerable, results from the Kenya
evaluation revealed good sources of resistance in each class of wheat.
The assistance that has been offered to Kenya was initiated to answer the
call for helping preserve wheat production in developing countries. But the
research also offers basic information that ARS may need some day, should
Ug99 ever appear in the United States.
ARS is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's chief scientific research agency.

[The cereal crop plant wheat (bread wheat, _Triticum aestivum_ and durum
wheat, _Triticum turgidum_) develops symptoms of stem rust when infected
with the fungus _Puccinia graminis f.sp. tritici_. Severe losses due to
wheat stem rusts have been held at bay worldwide due to effective
resistance breeding.
Part [1] above is the most recent, reporting new strains of stem rust in
Australia. Little detail is provided on their characteristics with
regards to resistance-breaking potential. This underlines the fact that
new strains of the fungus can and will emerge over time to threaten
currently grown varieties of wheat.
This moderator has included 3 other recent articles on another new strain
of stem rust known as Ug99. It has spread from Uganda to Kenya and
Ethiopia and has caught the attention of international plant pathologists
for its potential to become a world threat. An international meeting was
held on Ug99 in 2005 and some of the points discussed there are outlined in
part [2]. The full report of the meeting is to be found in the first link
below. The threat of introducing this strain to India is commented on in
part [3]. This biosecurity issue is linked to the recently announced (Feb
2006) willingness to import large quantities of wheat after a 7-year
prohibition. Finally, the long-term plan to combat new strains of stem
rust -- now, as in the past -- relies on finding, breeding or creating
wheat cultivars with resistance to any new strain of the pathogen. Part [4]
outlines ongoing efforts in this regard with respect to strain Ug99.
