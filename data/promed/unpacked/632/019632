The number of countries in the WHO European Region with increased influenza activity continued to rise in week 02/2015, particularly in the west and north, and the proportion of sentinel specimens testing positive for influenza virus increased to 28 percent from 16 percent and 17 percent in the previous 2 weeks. Although influenza activity remained low in most countries in the Region, 15 of 45 countries reported medium activity.

Influenza A(H3N2) viruses continued to predominate in most countries, according to data from primary care, the numbers of laboratory-confirmed hospitalized cases, and other information.

The influenza season is clearly underway, mainly in western and northern European countries: the overall proportion of influenza-positive sentinel specimens was above 10 percent for the 4th consecutive week, despite most countries' still reporting low intensity of influenza activity.

Overall, influenza A(H3N2) viruses have been the predominant viruses detected across all surveillance systems, although some countries reported either influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 or influenza B virus. In addition, most of the A(H3N2) viruses characterized genetically belong to genetic subgroups containing viruses that have drifted antigenically compared to the A(H3N2) virus in use for the 2014-2015 northern hemisphere influenza vaccine. 93 A(H3N2) viruses, 20 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses and 4 influenza B viruses tested since the start of the season showed susceptibility to the antivirals oseltamivir and zanamivir that are licensed in Europe.

No indication of increased mortality has been reported in the European project for monitoring excess mortality for public health action (EuroMOMO: http://www.euromomo.eu).

Influenza virus detections in the region
--------------------------
Virus characteristics

Since week 40/2014, the antigenic characteristics of 117 influenza viruses have been reported (Table 1), and 202 viruses have been genetically characterized (Table 2). The 21 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses that have been characterized to date are similar to those included in the 2014-2015 northern hemisphere trivalent vaccine. Of the 30 influenza B viruses characterized antigenically, 28 were B/Yamagata/16/88-lineage-like (included in the 2014-2015 northern hemisphere trivalent vaccine), and 2 influenza B viruses were B/Brisbane/60/2008-like viruses from the Victoria lineage (recommended for inclusion in quadrivalent vaccines). The results of genetic and antigenic characterization of A(H3N2) viruses indicate that the situation in the European Region is similar to that reported by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for week 53/2014 (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly): that most A(H3N2) viruses fall in genetic groups containing viruses that are significantly different antigenically from the current A(H3N2) component of the seasonal influenza vaccine. This situation is being monitored closely as the season progresses.

Viruses attributed to antigenic categories, weeks 40/2014-02/2015
-----------------------------
Antigenic group / Number of viruses:

A(H1N1)pdm09 A/California/7/2009-like 1 / 2

A(H3N2) A/Texas/50/2012-like 140A(H3N2) A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 like / 26

B/Massachusetts/02/2012-like (Yamagata lineage) / 1
B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like (Yamagata lineage) lineage 2 no. 1 / 1
B/Phuket/3073/2013-like (Yamagata lineage) lineage 2 no. 1 / 7
B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (Victoria lineage 1/2 / 3

1) Included in influenza vaccines for the 2014-2015 northern hemisphere influenza season
2) Recommended by WHO for inclusion in influenza vaccines for the 2015 southern hemisphere influenza season
3) Recommended for use in quadrivalent vaccines containing both influenza type B lineages
