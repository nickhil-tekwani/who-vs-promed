Correction of Misstatements
----------------------------
The posting entitled "Viral encephalitis - USA (Louisiana)" contains some
misstatements.
Firstly, western equine encephalitis is not unusual in Louisiana, it is
nonexistent. The virus does not occur there, although a closely related
alphavirus, Highlands J virus, does. Highlands J virus has never been shown
to cause a human illness, anywhere.
Secondly, encephalitis is not a disease carried by mosquitoes. Encephalitis
is a clinical picture, one that can be caused by a variety of viruses and
other agents (and tumors, auto accidents, and more). Mosquitoes can transmit
viruses that can cause encephalitis but the illness is not carried by the
mosquitoes.
Thirdly, the diagnoses of eastern equine encephalitis in horses reported by
the state health department are not "confirmed" cases, they are
"presumptive" cases. Pretty good presumption but single sera cannot provide
confirmation of anything except the presence of antibody. Significant
changes in anti-viral antibody titers between paired acute- and
convalescent-phase samples, virus isolation, or PCR-detection of viral RNA
are required to make a confirmed diagnosis. As both horses have died, this
will now be impossible. The "confirmed" diagnosis of La Crosse encephalitis
in the child likewise is incorrect, and for the same reasons as above. What
"presumed to be La Crosse virus" is beyond me.
Fourthly, and related to the above, that the reports indicated "alphavirus
positive" might as well suggest that these horses had been recently infected
with Highlands J virus, which has been recognized as a human pathogen. The
presence of such antibody (no mention was made of the antigen used) could as
easily indicate the horses were recently infected with Highlands J virus,
then run over by trucks.
