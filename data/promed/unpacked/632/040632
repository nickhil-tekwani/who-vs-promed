[This is the 1st time that African horse sickness is reported to occur in Thailand.

"African horse sickness (AHS) is an infectious but noncontagious viral disease affecting all species of Equidae caused by an orbivirus of the family Reoviridae and characterised by alterations in the respiratory and circulatory functions. AHS is transmitted by at least 2 species of _Culicoides_. Nine different serotypes have been described.

"All serotypes of AHS occur in eastern and southern Africa. AHS serotypes 9, 4, and 2 have been found in North and West Africa, from where they occasionally spread into countries surrounding the Mediterranean. Examples of outbreaks that have occurred outside Africa are in the Middle East (1959-1963), in Spain (serotype 9, 1966; serotype 4, 1987-1990), and in Portugal (serotype 4, 1989).

"Laboratory diagnosis of AHS is essential. Although the clinical signs and lesions are characteristic, they can be confused with those of other equine diseases.

"As a viral disease, the laboratory diagnosis of AHS can be based on the identification of infectious virus, virus nucleic acid, viral antigens, or specific antibodies. A wide variety of laboratory tests have been adapted for the detection of both AHS virus (AHSV) and specific antibodies.

"There is no evidence that humans can become infected with any field strain of AHSV, either through contact with naturally or experimentally infected animals or by virus manipulation in laboratories."

According to the media reports circulating in Thailand, "It's been prompted by a horse keeper who refuses to name the farm and its name, fearing to lose the reputation of the farm, that there is a horse farm in the area leading zebras before sending them abroad" (see https://www.thairath.co.th/news/local/northeast/1805859). (Information was translated from Thai to English.)

"Thailand Equestrian Federation had circulated a letter dated [26 Mar 2020] advising all members to stop moving horses out of their areas to stem the possible spread of the disease" (https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1887870/deadly-virus-kills-42-racehorses-in-korat).

In an article published in Vet. Res. 35 (2004), Philip Scott Mellor and Christopher Hamblin noted that "subsequent to 1966, AHSV was reported only from sub-Saharan Africa for over 20 years. However, in July 1987, an outbreak of AHS due to serotype 4 of the virus was reported in central Spain, in the provinces of Madrid, Toledo, and Avila. The outbreak was apparently caused by the importation of a number of sub-clinically infected zebra from Namibia into a safari park at Aldea del Fresno some 45 km [28 mi] SW of Madrid. This park subsequently became the site of the 1st 27 cases of AHS in Spanish horses in 1987." This full article is available at https://www.vetres.org/articles/vetres/pdf/2004/04/V4013.pdf.

It will be helpful to obtain laboratory information on the strain's serotype and on possible sources of the origin of infection.

According to Resolution No. 20, (https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/Resolutions/2019/A_R20_AHS_status.pdf) adopted at the 87th General Session of the World Assembly in May 2019, Thailand was recognized as free from AHS based on the provisions of Chapter 12.1. of the Terrestrial Code. Unfortunately, this 1st detection of the disease in Thailand could mean the suspension of its current AHS-free status.
