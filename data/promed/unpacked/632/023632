- Number of states affected: 3 / 24 / 14
- Local government areas (LGAs) affected: 5 / 98 / 58

Highlights
----------
- In week 26, the number of new confirmed cases decreased from 10 in week 25, 2022 to 9 cases. These were reported from Ondo, Edo, and Benue States (Table 3)
- Cumulatively from week 1 to week 26, 2022, 160 deaths have been reported with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 19.3% which is lower than the CFR for the same period in 2021 (20.0%)
- In total for 2022, 24 States have recorded at least one confirmed case across 98 Local Government Areas (Figures 2 and 3)
- Of all confirmed cases, 68% are from Ondo (29%), Edo (25%), and Bauchi (14%) States.
- The predominant age group affected is 21-30 years (Range: 1 to 90 years, Median Age: 30 years). The male-to-female ratio for confirmed cases is 1:0.8 (Figure 4)
- The number of suspected cases has increased compared to that reported for the same period in 2021
- No new Healthcare worker affected in the reporting week 26
- National Lassa fever multi-partner, multi-sectoral Technical Working Group (TWG)
continues to coordinate the response activities at all levels

Response activities
-------------------
- Lassa fever alert letters sent to States
- The National Emergency Operations Centre response mode Level 2 activated for effective multi-sectoral, multi-disciplinary coordination of 2022 Lassa fever outbreak response
- Lassa fever preparedness assessment carried out for 36 States and FCT
- State Public Health Emergency Operations Centre activated in affected States
- The 8 Lassa fever molecular laboratories in the NCDC network are working at full capacity to ensure that all samples are tested, and results provided within the shortest turnaround time
- Confirmed cases are treated at identified treatment centres across the States
- Dissemination of reviewed case management and safe burial practices guidelines
- Dissemination of reviewed IPC guidelines and health facility IPC advisory
- Risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across States using television, radio, print, social media and other strategies
- Implementation of Lassa fever Environmental response campaign in high burden States by Federal Ministry of Environment
- Distribution of medical response commodities to States and treatment centre
- Engagement of ad-hoc data clerks to upload case management data on SORMAS
- Deployment of National Rapid Respond Teams (NRRT) deployment to Nasarawa, FCT, Edo, Ondo, Bauchi, Ebonyi, Oyo, Taraba, and Benue

Notes on this report
--------------------
Data Source
Information for this disease was case based data retrieved from the National Lassa fever Emergency
Operations Centre.

Case definitions:
- Suspected case: any individual presenting with one or more of the following: malaise, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia, chest pain, hearing loss, and either
a. history of contact with excreta or urine of rodents;
b. history of contact with a probable or confirmed Lassa fever case within a period of 21 days of onset of symptoms; or
c. any person with inexplicable bleeding/hemorrhage.
- Confirmed case: any suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, PCR, or virus isolation).
- Probable case: any suspected case (see definition above) who died or absconded without collection of a specimen for laboratory testing.
- Contact: anyone who has been exposed to an infected person, or to an infected person's secretions, excretions, or tissues within 3 weeks of last contact with a confirmed or probable case of Lassa fever

Calculations
- Case fatality rate (CFR) for this disease is reported for confirmed cases only.

[There were 9 new confirmed and 130 new suspected Lassa fever (LF) cases in week 26 (27 Jun-3 Jul 2022), indicating that LF virus transmission is continuing at a relatively low level. There was 1 death among the confirmed cases for week 26, 2022. Fortunately, no newly infected healthcare workers were reported in week 26.

The report above confirms that Edo, Ondo, and Bauchi states have the most confirmed cases. The number of states affected is 24 so far this year (2022), and the number of local government areas (LGAs) with at least one case is 98.

Nigeria is now in a period where case numbers have declined and remain stable at relatively low levels. Case numbers are likely to continue to remain relatively low in the coming weeks. The graph in Figure 6 indicates that a peak of cases occurred between weeks 3 and 11 in recent years and peaked in weeks 7-9 this year (2022).

Transmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It is encouraging to learn from this and previous reports that risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states in Nigeria using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies for avoidance of contact with rodent virus reservoirs and their excreta.

Images of the rodent reservoirs of Lassa fever virus:

One hopes that the ongoing public information campaign will help the local population to avoid the entry of these reservoir rodents into their houses and other buildings. - Mod.TY
