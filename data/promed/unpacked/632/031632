In particular, Ha Nam province in the north and Binh Phuoc in the

northern Hai Duong province, southern Long An province, and northern

[Hopefully, the prospects of an improved epidemiological situation in
Viet Nam are realistic. The credibility of media-derived data should
be evaluated in light of official reports. The last HPAI follow-up
report to the OIE from Viet Nam was sent on 4 Jan 2005.
According to OIE's statistics as of 11 Feb 2005, the accumulated
total of officially reported HPAI outbreaks in Eastern Asia since
December 2003 have been the following: Cambodia 13, China (People's
Rep. of) 50, Hong Kong (SARPRC) 0, Indonesia 169, Japan 5, Korea
(Rep. of) 19, Laos 1, Malaysia 10, Thailand 1064, Viet Nam 1764. -
