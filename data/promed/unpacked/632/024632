Arizona: West Nile Virus Kills Parrot at Phoenix Zoo
--------------------------------------------------
A thick-billed parrot at the Phoenix Zoo has died of West Nile virus
infection, zoo officials said Tue 21 Oct 2003. The parrot was one of
8 on exhibit in the zoo's Arizona Trail and is endangered in Arizona.
It became sick 3 weeks ago and died the day after zookeepers noticed
its illness. The University of Arizona veterinary lab on Tue 21 Oct
2003 confirmed the cause of death as West Nile virus infection. It is
the first animal case of the virus at the zoo. Officials say they
will continue monitoring zoo animals for West Nile, which is
transmitted through mosquito bites. The zoo routinely vaccinates its
flamingos, zebras, horses, and mules against West Nile virus
infection.

[As of Wed 22 Oct 2003, in the USA only 4 states -- Hawaii, Alaska,
Nevada, and Oregon -- have remained entirely free of West Nile virus
infection of any animal species (apart from travel-related human
cases) since the appearance of the virus in North America.
The weekly counts of new human cases during the past 8 weeks have
been 414, 1046, 1214, 690, 1034, 646, 450, and now 429; it is clear
that the outbreak is past its peak. The 3 western/midwestern states
of Colorado, Nebraska, and South Dakota have accounted for 60.7
percent (4484/7386) of the total number of confirmed human cases and
43.9 percent (68/155) of fatalities in 2003. - Mod.CP]
