AVIAN INFLUENZA, HUMAN (185): WHO INVESTIGATION GUIDELINES

The World Health Organization (WHO) this week released guidelines for
investigating human cases of H5N1 avian influenza in an effort to
shed more light on the virus and improve the chances of detecting
changes that could turn it into a pandemic strain.
The 14-page document calls for a thorough probe of each case, from
interviewing the patient and searching for contacts through hunting
for other cases nearby and sifting data for any signs of
human-to-human transmission. It calls for investigating suspected
cases before laboratory test results are available.
The new guidance comes less than a month after the WHO issued a
report on how much remains unknown about the H5N1 virus. Written by a
group of leading flu experts, that report, issued Nov 2, said H5N1
illness is fundamentally different from ordinary flu in its severity
and range of manifestations. Among other things, the panel called for
research to determine why children and young adults seem especially
susceptible and whether genetic factors increase the risk of
infection or transmission among blood relatives.
The introduction to the new guidance says, "The document reflects and
incorporates the practical field experience gained by investigators
working at international, national, and sub-national levels during
investigations of A(H5N1)."
The intention is that local health agencies will use the guidelines
to build their own investigative plans and procedures, the WHO says.
The purposes of case investigation, according to the guidelines,
include:
(1) Confirming the diagnosis of H5N1;
(2) Reducing illness and death by rapidly identifying cases and
starting appropriate treatment and precautions;
(3) Reducing further spread by identifying possible sources of
exposure and implementing prevention and control measures;
(4) Determining if human-to-human transmission is becoming more efficient;
(5) Identifying the key epidemiologic, clinical, and virologic
characteristics of each case;
(6) Ensuring timely exchange of information among clinicians, health
investigators, and government officials to facilitate appropriate
responses.
In advice on searching for patients' contacts, the WHO says
investigators should assume that patients are infectious for 1 week
before onset of illness and 2 weeks afterward, even though the
infectious period for treatment, depending on their risk of exposure,
as defined in other WHO guidance.
Besides tracing contacts, investigators should search actively for
other possible H5N1 cases by going from house to house and possibly
conducting telephone surveys of healthcare facilities, practitioners,
and labs, the WHO advises.
The agency recommends against using rapid diagnostic tests for the
H5N1 virus. "The diagnostic accuracy of commercially available rapid
tests is unknown, and if the test result is positive, differentiation
between influenza A subtypes is not possible and confirmatory tests
must be done," the document says.
In its 2 Nov 2006 report, the WHO said a rapid, reliable diagnostic
test for H5N1 infection was urgently needed.
The guidance document discusses potential clues to a change in the
virus's human transmissibility and what to look for in evaluating
clusters of cases. It also suggests doing complementary studies, such
as seroprevalence surveys of people with possible occupational risk
in affected areas and case-control studies to evaluate risk factors
for infection.

is currently under revision. - Mod.CP]

[These guidelines reflect concern that human cases of H5N1 virus may
be escaping detection because of some difficulties encountered in
diagnosis, as expressed recently in 2 papers published in the New
England Journal of Medicine (see ProMED-mail post entitled: "Avian
influenza, human (181): Indonesia, Turkey 20061124.3337" for detailed
discussion).
