We have had 2 cases [of a hantavirus infection] in one household in Mono County. One was briefly hospitalized, and both have recovered.

This is very unusual in that this is the 1st household cluster ever reported in California. Given that the death rate from hantavirus infections is high (more than 25 per cent), it is also unusual that neither person was seriously ill with their infection.

Remember, it is all about contact with urine and feces from the deer mouse [_Peromyscus maniculatus_]. See the following link for more information on protecting yourself: http://www.cdph.ca.gov/healthinfo/discond/Pages/HantavirusPulmonarySyndrome.as.

[It was indeed fortunate that neither of these cases was serious and did not develop into hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome.

The hantavirus responsible for these cases was not specified but undoubtedly was Sin Nombre virus, which is endemic in deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_) there. Although this may be the 1st time that a household cluster of cases has been reported in California, there was a cluster of cases in Yosemite National Park, California in 2012, when 10 confirmed patients came from 3 states: California (8), West Virginia (1), and Pennsylvania (1). Of these, 9 patients had typical symptoms of HPS, and one lacked respiratory symptoms; 3 died. These individuals were exposed in a permanent campsite where the deer mice were living between the walls of double-walled tents.

Although cases of Sin Nombre virus infection are relatively rare, they can be very serious, as the 4 HPS deaths in Colorado this year (2015) indicate. The public needs to be aware of the circumstances that lead to risk of virus transmission. This is particularly important during spring and summer, when cabins and other outbuildings that have been closed for several months are reopened and cleaned out, raising dust that may be contaminated with virus from deer mice hosts.
