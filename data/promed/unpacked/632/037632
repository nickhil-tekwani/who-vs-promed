Equine influenza epidemic breaks out in Mongolia
------------------------------------------------
The Mongolian government has confirmed equine influenza, a disease
that mainly affects horses, broke out in 14 provinces. The
government's news office announced the confirmation Tuesday [2 Aug
2011] after suspected cases were recently discovered in 18 provinces
of the country, where horses still play a key role.

According to a Mongolian government report, Mongolian Vice Premier M.
Enkhbold called a state emergency situation committee meeting on
Monday to respond to the epidemic. Millions of horses will need to be
vaccinated, given cases of the disease have been discovered in all but
3 provinces -- Bayan-Ulgii, Zavkhan and Umnugobi.

Equine influenza usually broke out in spring and fall, said an
official of the Mongolian veterinarian and breeding bureau. He urged
vaccination to be carried out as soon as possible.

Mongolia has experienced several equine influenza outbreaks in the
past few decades. Outbreaks in Khovd province in 2007 and 2008 caused
huge losses to the local livestock industry.

Animal husbandry is a dominant factor in the agriculture sector of
Mongolia, which has more than 40 million livestock, 2 million of which
are horses.

[Between October 2007 and May 2008, Mongolia suffered its last
epizootic of equine influenza which spread throughout its western
territories, caused by virus subtype H3N8. Wide-scale vaccinations
were applied (see references). As it appears from a recent
notification to the OIE, the disease has recurred, reportedly starting
on 9 Jul 2011 in Ulaanbaatar city, Tuv, caused by the same virus
subtype. The "Immediate notification," dated 19 Jul 2011, including an
interactive map showing the location of the 1st focus (central
Mongolia), is available at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=10798.

As apparent from the above media item, the disease has fulminated; a
follow-up report with updated information is anticipated. - Mod.AS]
