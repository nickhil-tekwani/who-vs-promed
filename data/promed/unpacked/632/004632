["Bluetongue (BT) virus can be found worldwide within tropical and subtropical climates from approximately 35 degrees S to 40 degrees N, and in some areas outside this region (e.g., in parts of California [USA]). Endemic areas exist in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, North and South America and Asia, as well as on numerous islands (e.g., Australia, the South Pacific, the Caribbean). Multiple serotypes can be found in many regions. Outbreaks can occur outside endemic areas, but in most cases, the virus does not persist once cold weather kills the _Culicoides_ vectors. Unusually, a serotype 8 virus overwintered for multiple years in central and northern Europe." http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/bluetongue.pdf

In February 2014, one outbreak of BT was reported in the Kweneng district (see posting 20140828.2728819). The event was resolved on 26 Aug 2014. See event summary and map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=15919.

Southern is one of the districts of Botswana. It borders the North West Province of South Africa. Domestically, it borders the following districts: South-East District - east; Kweneng District - north (where the previous outbreak was located) and Kgalagadi District - south west. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_District_%28Botswana%29
