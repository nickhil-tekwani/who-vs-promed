The regional director of Health, Alberto Caro Palavisini, reports
that recently 3 deaths have taken place from yellow fever in the
province of La Convencion, department of Cuzco.
The regional director of health of Cuzco maintained that one of these
deaths was registered in the sector of Matoriato.
The authorities decided to elaborate a contingency plan that includes
a mass vaccination campaign against yellow fever, for all people
coming to the valleys of La Convencion.

[La Convencion is the northernmost province in the department of
Cuzco, beyond Cuzco city & Macchu Picchu. Nevertheless, it would be
prudent for travelers to those tourist spots to get vaccinated, to
protect against the possibility that a patient harboring the YF virus
is hospitalized and infects urban mosquitoes. Macchu Picchu itself is
too high for _Aedes aegypti_, but you have to go to Cuzco first in
order to get there. See map:
