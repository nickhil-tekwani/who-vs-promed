Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Beaulon, Beaulon, Allier [Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes]
Date of start of the outbreak: 6 Apr 2020
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: other
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Wild boar: _Sus scrofa_ (Suidae) / 108 / 2 / 0 / - / -
Affected population: wild boar kept to be released in the forest for hunting purposes. To be found on the site: 3 males, 15 sows, and 90 juveniles

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Wild boar: _Sus scrofa_ (Suidae) / 1.85 / 0 / 0 / **
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter
**Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive.
Epidemiological comments: contamination by other specimens of non-captive wildlife is very likely to have happened, by contact through the fence. There is no epidemiological link with domestic swine farms. Within the 5 km [about 3 mi] perimeter around the site, no other holding keeping wild boar or swine farms have been identified.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; screening; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: stamping out; disinfection

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Anses [French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety] Ploufragan-Plouzane-Niort Laboratory, Ploufragan site (regional reference laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Wild boar / Competitive ELISA (c-ELISA) / 6 Apr 2020 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Although most mammals are susceptible to infections with pseudorabies virus (PRV), swine seem to represent the main host reservoir. Due to increased control efforts and the strict implementation of national eradication programs, which have included large-scale vaccination and using the strategy of differentiating infected from vaccinated animals, Aujeszky's disease has virtually disappeared from domestic pigs in several parts of Europe, including France (except for a few departments).

PRV-infected feral swine represent a potential source of infection for domestic pigs in North America. By contrast, reports on PRV-infections of wild boar in Europe are scarce. Based on official hunting statistics, Germany and France are believed to have among the highest population densities of wild boar in Europe. Serosurveys revealed the occurrence of PRV infections in wild boar in at least 14 European countries, including Belgium, Croatia, the Czech Republic, the former Yugoslavia, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, and Switzerland, with the average seroprevalence ranging between 0.3% and 66%. - Mod.PMB
