The Wildlife Department has failed to control the Newcastle "Ranikhet" disease, as 2 more peacocks died of the deadly disease here on Thursday [18 Jul 2013], raising the overall death toll to 118.

It should be mentioned that the beauty of Tharparkar, renowned for its free-wandering peacocks, is fading due to the deaths of the peacocks from bird epidemics.

More than 300 peacocks were killed by Newcastle disease, locally known as Ranikhet, last year [2012], and 118 have died during the last 2 months.

The locals, who love the precious birds like their other pets, have expressed grave concerns over the spread of the disease, as it has claimed more than 100 of their beloved birds besides leaving dozens of others affected. It is feared that the death toll may rise further, as many peacocks were said to be infected. Locals demanded that the Wildlife Department and the government take steps to save the birds.

[The peacock, _Pavo cristatus_, is a resident breeder across the Indian subcontinent. Virtually all birds are considered susceptible to infection with Newcastle disease virus (NDV; Fam. Paramyxoviridae).
