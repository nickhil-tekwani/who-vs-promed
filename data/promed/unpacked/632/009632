SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, USA
------------------------
Information received on [and dated] Wed 22 Apr 2020 from Dr. Mark Davidson, associate administrator, USDA-APHIS, United States Department of Agriculture, Washington, United States of America

Summary
Report type: follow-up report No 2
Date of start of the event: 27 Mar 2020
Date of confirmation of the event: 4 Apr 2020
Reason for notification: emerging disease
Morbidity: 2 (scale 0 to 5)
Mortality: 0 (scale 0 to 5)
Zoonotic impact: zoonotic potential currently unknown
Causal agent: SARS-CoV-2

New outbreaks (2)
Outbreak location 1: Nassau County, Nassau, New York
Date of start of the outbreak: 1 Apr 2020
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: other
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cats / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: Pet domestic cat (_Felis catus_) in a residential household

Outbreak location 2: Orange County, Orange, New York
Date of start of the outbreak: 6 Apr 2020
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: other
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cats / 2 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: Pet domestic cat (_Felis catus_) in a residential household

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 2
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cats / 3 / 2 / 0 / 0 / 0

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cats / 66.67 / 0 / 0 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: suspected human transmission.

Epidemiological comments: [22 Apr 2020] Update -- 2 cats from separate households were sampled for respiratory illness. Clinical signs included sneezing and ocular discharge. Samples from the cats were tested by SARS-CoV-2 PCR after testing negative for other respiratory pathogens. One cat is from a 2-cat household with a known COVID-19 affected person, the other from a household in an affected neighborhood and allowed to go outdoors. SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in samples based upon molecular testing (PCR and sequencing) of samples from the initial testing laboratory and follow up samples obtained directly. Both cats are expected to fully recover, and testing of follow up samples indicated both cats were clearing the infection.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; disinfection; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type
National Veterinary Services Laboratories (National laboratory
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cats / gene sequencing / 17 Apr 2020 / Positive
Cats / gene sequencing / 20 Apr 2020 / Positive
Cats / real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 15 Apr 2020 / Positive
Cats / real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 20 Apr 2020 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[According to the epidemiological comments made in its follow-up report No 1 on 17 Apr 2020, USA informed the OIE that: "One of the 3 previously reported exposed lions at a zoo was confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 on 15 Apr 2020 [see ProMED-mail report 20200406.7191480]. This follows the initial report of a tiger confirmed on 4 Apr 2020. It is likely that the infection was transmitted by an infected human. Clinical signs previously noted in the lions and tigers included dry cough and some wheezing. All of the animals who exhibited clinical signs are progressively improving. There are no other suspected cases of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 in any animals from the zoo at this time". See report at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=34054.

The following information is part of the latest press release published on 22 Apr 2020 from USDA_APHIS https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/newsroom/news/sa_by_date/sa-2020/sars-cov-2-animals:

"Public health officials are still learning about SARS-CoV-2, but there is no evidence that pets play a role in spreading the virus in the United States. Therefore, there is no justification in taking measures against companion animals that may compromise their welfare. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals, including pets, could be affected.

"Until we know more, CDC recommends the following:

- Do not let pets interact with people or other animals outside the household.
- Keep cats indoors when possible to prevent them from interacting with other animals or people.
- Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet from other people and animals.
- Avoid dog parks or public places where a large number of people and dogs gather.

"If you are sick with COVID-19 (either suspected or confirmed by a test), restrict contact with your pets and other animals, just like you would around other people.

- When possible, have another member of your household care for your pets while you are sick.
- Avoid contact with your pet, including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked and sharing food or bedding.
- If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with them.

"While additional animals may test positive as infections continue in people, it is important to note that performing this animal testing does not reduce the availability of tests for humans. The U.S. government remains committed to increasing nationwide COVID-19 testing for Americans. In fact, the United States has conducted more than 4 million COVID-19 tests for humans, which is more tests than the following nations combined: France, the UK, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, India, Austria, Australia, Sweden, and Canada.
