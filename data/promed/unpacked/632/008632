The proliferation of the H7N9 bird flu virus among poultry in live-bird markets in Guangxi [Autonomous Region] has "significantly increased the risk" that it will spread to neighbouring countries, a United Nations agency warned. The Food and Agriculture Organisation yesterday [6 Feb 2014] urged countries sharing a border with China to review their emergency preparations and response plans to address a possible outbreak. "The current situation in Guangxi will require a renewed vigilance to mitigate the effects of cross-border spread," it said. Its warning came after the province reported 2 human cases of H7N9 on Tuesday [4 Feb 2014], involving a 5 year old boy and his 41 year old mother.

Guangxi, which shares a border with Viet Nam, was where the Chinese authorities tracked movement of the H7N9 infection to live-bird markets between [24 and 28 Jan 2014]. It was also where the 1st human casualty was reported. Neighbouring Yunnan shares borders with Viet Nam, Myanmar, and Laos. China's national health commission said there was no proof that H7N9 was spreading sustainably from person to person, but it could not rule out the possibility of "limited" human-to-human infections.

There have been at least 290 confirmed human H7N9 cases and 66 deaths in the mainland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Beijing, Guangdong, and Hunan each reported a new human case of H7N9 yesterday [6 Feb 2014], while Jiangsu reported 2, the Xinhua News agency said. All patients had been exposed to poultry except the Guangdong case, but there were no details about how the Foshan [Guangdong] woman, 36, contracted the virus.

The fact that the virus produced no detectable symptoms among infected birds had seriously disrupted poultry production and markets, the UN said, adding that close contact between infected poultry and humans -- particularly during festivals such as the Lunar New Year [31 Jan 2014] -- presented a serious health risk.

Despite the risk, there was no evidence that the virus was present in Vie Nam or any of China's other neighbouring countries in Southeast Asia. But there were indications, based on experience with the H5N1 virus, that H7N9 was easily capable of crossing borders. A 3 week ban on live chicken sales is in effect in Hong Kong until [18 Feb 2014] after H7N9 was found in a live chicken from the mainland. University of Hong Kong microbiologist Ho Pak-leung said poultry exposure was the main cause of human infections and warned the public to avoid contact with live poultry.

Beijing has confirmed this year's [2014] 2nd human case of the H7N9 bird flu, the local health authority said on Thursday [6 Feb 2014]. The patient, who was still in critical condition Thursday, had raised, traded and slaughtered live poultry before falling ill, the Beijing municipal health and family planning commission said in a press release. The document said the case was confirmed by the municipal disease prevention and control center on Wednesday [5 Feb 2014], but did not identify the patient.

The capital city's 1st human H7N9 case was reported on [24 Jan 2014]. The patient, a man, had reportedly bought pigeons and eaten them before testing positive for H7N9 bird flu.

http://7thspace.com/headlines/452129/chp_notified_of_10_additional_human_cases_of_avian_influenza_ah7n9_in_mainland.html


The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) yesterday [5 Feb 2014] received notification of 10 additional human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) respectively in Zhaoqing (2 cases), Foshan (one case), and Shenzhen (one case) from the Health and Family Planning Commission of Guangdong Province, and in Fujian (one case), Guangxi (one case), and Zhejiang (4 cases) from the National Health and Family Planning Commission.

The cases in Zhaoqing involve a girl aged 5 and a man aged 42, while those in Foshan and Shenzhen are 2 men aged 49 and 56 respectively. All of them are now hospitalised for treatment. The case in Fujian is a man aged 36 and that in Guangxi is a woman aged 41 with disease onset when working in Guangdong. The cases in Zhejiang involve 2 men aged 49 and 67 and 2 women aged 35 and 59. All are currently being treated in hospital.

As of yesterday [5 Feb 2014], a total of 302 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been confirmed in the Mainland, including Zhejiang (122 cases), Guangdong (54 cases), Shanghai (41 cases), Jiangsu (37 cases), Fujian (19 cases), Hunan (6 cases), Jiangxi (6 cases), Anhui (4 cases), Henan (4 cases), Beijing (3 cases), Guangxi (2 cases), Shandong (2 cases), Guizhou (one case, imported from Zhejiang), and Hebei (one case). The CHP is closely monitoring the situation.

"Locally, enhanced disease surveillance, port health measures, and health education against avian influenza are ongoing. We will remain vigilant and maintain liaison with the World Health Organization (WHO) and relevant health authorities. Local surveillance activities will be modified upon the WHO's recommendations," a spokesman for the DH remarked. "In view of human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) confirmed in Hong Kong and multiple cases notified by the Mainland, the activity of the virus is expected to be higher in the winter season.

Those planning to travel outside Hong Kong should maintain good personal, environmental, and food hygiene at all times," the spokesman urged. "All boundary control points have implemented disease prevention and control measures. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks of inbound travellers. Random temperature checks by handheld devices have also been arranged. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up investigation," the spokesman added. Regarding health education for travellers, distribution of pamphlets, display of posters in departure and arrival halls, in-flight public announcements, environmental health inspection, and provision of regular updates to the travel industry via meetings and correspondence are all proceeding.

The spokesman advised travellers, especially those returning from avian influenza-affected areas and provinces with fever or respiratory symptoms, to immediately wear masks, seek medical attention, and reveal their travel history to doctors. Health care professionals should pay special attention to patients who might have had contact with poultry, birds, or their droppings in affected areas and provinces.

Members of the public should remain vigilant and take heed of the preventive advice against avian influenza below:
- do not visit live poultry markets and farms. Avoid contact with poultry, birds and their droppings. If contact has been made, thoroughly wash hands with soap;
- avoid entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with surfaces which might be contaminated by droppings of poultry or other animals;
- poultry and eggs should be thoroughly cooked before eating;
- wash hands frequently with soap, especially before touching the mouth, nose, or eyes, handling food or eating; after going to the toilet or touching public installations or equipment (including escalator handrails, elevator control panels, and door knobs); or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing;
- cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing, hold the spit with a tissue and put it into a covered dustbin;
- avoid crowded places and contact with fever patients; and
- wear masks when respiratory symptoms develop or when taking care of fever patients.

The public may visit the CHP's avian influenza page (http://www.chp.gov.hk/en/view_content/24244.html) and website (http://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/global_statistics_avian_influenza_e.pdf) for more information on avian influenza-affected areas and provinces.

[The avian influenza H7N9 virus outbreak is maintaining its characteristic features and can be expected to continue at least for the duration of the normal 'seasonal' winter epidemic period. It seems inevitable that the outbreak may extend beyond the borders of mainland China, unless there is more stringent control of the movement of poultry in border regions. - Mod.CP
