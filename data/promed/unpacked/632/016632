Another patient in Taiwan has been diagnosed with hantavirus hemorrhagic fever, bringing the number of confirmed cases in the country to 7 so far this year, the [Taiwan] Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said Tuesday [23 Jun 2020].

The patient, in his 40s, lives in Pingtung County [Taiwan province] and works at a meat processing plant in Kaohsiung [Kaohsiung county], CDC Epidemic Intelligence Center Director Liu Ting-ping said at a weekly briefing in Taipei.

The man developed a fever, diarrhea, and muscle pains on [1 Jun 2020], and he tested positive for the rodent-borne disease on 4 Jun [2020] Liu said, adding that patient has since recovered.

Health officials caught 11 rats in total at the man's home and workplace and disinfected the areas to prevent the spread of the disease, Liu said.

As of 22 Jun [2020], 7 cases of hantavirus had been confirmed nationwide -- 4 in Kaohsiung, and one each in Pingtung County, Keelung City [Taiwan province], and New Taipei City, according to CDC data.

Since Taiwan began keeping track of the hantavirus disease in 2010, it has recorded 21 cases, most of them male patients, according to Liu.

The 7 cases confirmed so far in 2020 have been the highest number recorded in a single year, she said.

People usually become infected with hantaviruses through exposure to the urine and droppings of small rodents such as mice, which are the primary carriers, according to CDC physician Lin Yung-ching.

Symptoms usually appear within 2 weeks after exposure to the virus but can take up to 8 weeks to become evident, in rare cases, the CDC said. The initial symptoms usually start suddenly and include intense headaches, back and abdominal pain, fever, chills, nausea, and blurred vision.

According to the CDC, later symptoms may include low blood pressure, acute shock, vascular leakage, and acute kidney failure, which can cause severe fluid overload.

[As noted earlier, Taiwan has had sporadic cases of hantavirus infections in recent years, with the Taiwan CDC indicating that there have been 0-4 cases per year recently. The case above adds one more to this year's (2020) total.

The hantavirus involved is not stated, nor is the species of rat identified. However, the capture of rats in the man's home and workplace leads one to suspect Seoul hantavirus, assuming that the rats observed were brown rats (_Rattus norvegicus_), the natural host of this virus. There are some minor discrepancies between the case counts in the report above and those in the report posted on 16 Jun 2020. That report, dated 14 Jun 2020 stated that a woman in Kaohsiung City contracted [a] hantavirus [infection], becoming the 5th case in Kaohsiung City and the 7th case in the country this year [2020]. The report of the new cases above also places it as the 7th case nationally and the 4th in Kaohsiung City. Nonetheless, this year (2020) has seen an unusually large number of hantavirus infections in Taiwan and in Kaohsiung City.

In Asia, the 5 recognized hantaviruses, with their main rodent reservoir species, are Hantaan virus (_Apodemus agrarius_), Amur virus (_A. peninsulae_), Thailand virus (_Bandicota indica_), Seoul virus (widely distributed worldwide in the brown rat, _R. norvegicus_), and Muju virus (_Myodes regulus_). Hantaan virus and Seoul virus cause cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) frequently in China.

The hantavirus most likely involved in the case above in Taiwan is Seoul virus harbored by _Rattus_ spp., as was the case in 2010 (see ProMED-mail 20100415.1221). People become infected when exposed to the virus in excreta (urine, saliva, and feces) of infected rats. It is not necessary to have contact with liquid urine; dust particles contaminated with dried urine may be inhaled. Transmission can also occur via rat bite.

An image of the brown rat, _R. norvegicus_, a reservoir of Seoul virus, can be seen at http://www.discoverlife.org/im/I_RB/0000/320/Rattus_norvegicus,I_RB27.jpg. - Mod.TY
