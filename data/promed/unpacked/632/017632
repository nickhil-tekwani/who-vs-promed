A "dramatic increase" in winter ticks affecting moose in Vermont has officials proposing a moose hunt to lessen the impact of the parasites on the animals' population. One moose was found with as many as 90 000 winter ticks on its body, the Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department said.

Winter ticks are parasitic mites that can grow to over half an inch [1.27 cm], and they are known to target moose. In the north eastern corner of Vermont, moose density is more than one moose per square mile [2.6 sq km] -- higher than any other part of the state, the department said.

Officials are hoping to reduce the population of moose in order to cull the number of winter ticks. "Moose densities greater than one per square mile support high numbers of winter ticks which negatively impact moose health and survival," said Vermont Fish and Wildlife biologist Nick Fortin. More than half of moose calves in the area have died in recent winters because of blood loss caused by winter ticks.

The Fish and Wildlife Department proposed the moose hunt to the Vermont Fish and Wildlife Board at a [19 Feb 2020] meeting. The hunt would be limited to 33 moose. The ultimate goal is to reduce the number of hosts for winter ticks, thereby reducing the impact of winter ticks on the moose population. "Research has shown that lower moose densities, like in the rest of Vermont, support relatively few winter ticks that do not impact moose populations," said Fortin. "Reducing moose density decreases the number of available hosts which in turn decreases the number of winter ticks on the landscape."

Fortin said he believes that if they don't intervene, the health of the moose population in the area will continue to be impacted by high tick loads for years to come.

[The winter tick, _Dermacentor albipictus_, is a parasite of wild ungulates that consumes a blood meal from its host to complete its life cycle. While winter ticks have most often been found on moose (_Alces alces_), other wildlife species have been known to be parasitized by and have disease caused by _D. albipictus_, including caribou (_Rangifer tarandus_) and elk (_Cervus canadensis_). In early spring, moose may be showing large patches of broken or missing hair where they have tried to rub away ticks. Moose with large patches of broken hair are sometimes referred to as "ghost" moose, as the white base of the hair shaft is all that remains. See a picture at http://wildlifedisease.unbc.ca/winter_tick_moose1.jpg.

Increases in the tick population may have many drivers, one of the main ones being host density. For most parasites, prevalence will often be highest at higher host abundances. This is caused by increases in exposure rates and decreased host condition. Ultimately, this is a mechanism by which parasites regulate host populations. Reducing the moose population (by hunting) to reduce the tick population so it has less (natural) impact on the moose population is a somehow strange approach, especially because the natural impact will result in the death of those that are highly parasitized, whereas hunting might not be as selective. - Mod.PMB
