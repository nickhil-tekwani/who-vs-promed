At least 5 barasinghas (swamp deer) have died in the past fortnight at Jaldapara National Park, with the last death, an adult female, being reported on [Fri 17 Jun 2016]. The deaths occurred in a special enclosure where the endangered antelopes [sic; should read deer: antelopes are bovidae, barasinghas are cervidae = deer. - Mod.AS] have been housed under captive breeding programme.

According to the wildlife department, the 1st swamp deer died on 29 May 2016 due to foot-and-mouth disease [FMD]. An official said that since then "4 more swamp deer have died of the disease."

Sumita Ghatak, the conservator of forest, wildlife, (north), added, "It is a water and air-borne disease. We are spraying disinfectant around the enclosure to prevent the disease from spreading in the wild. The enclosure now has 11 swamp deer."

[It will be helpful to obtain information on the findings leading to the reported diagnosis as FMD: clinical observations, gross- and histopathological findings (special reference to cardiac changes), and virological examination results (serotype!).

Severe FMD cases in wild ruminants, with high mortalities, have been suspected in the past to be related to a combination of the pathogenicity of the FMD virus strain involved and the susceptibility of the affected populations. Such events were reported in antelopes of several species in Asia. One outbreak, affecting the Saigak (Saiga) antelope, was reported from Kazakhstan during the late 1960s; among the signs observed were the loss of horns and hooves and considerable mortality (Kindyakov, Nagumanov, et al (1970); Veterinariya 47, 52). A serious event was reported in Israel in 1985, affecting the protected mountain gazelle (_Gazella gazella_) population, with about 60 percent mortality among some 3000 adult animals. A similar event, on smaller scale, was reported there in 2007. The high pathogenicity of the FMDV strain involved (O ISR 1/85) in the involved gazelle population was confirmed in experimental infection trials. It was suggested that genetic susceptibility was established in the population of this, initially endangered, species following inbreeding (further details in the commentaries of 20070427.1372 and 20101025.3873).

The barasingha (swamp deer, _Rucervus duvaucelii_ syn. _Cervus duvaucelii_; see pictures at http://tinyurl.com/h723dh8) is listed as a "vulnerable" species in the Red list of the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature). According to the list's data (2015), the estimated total population lies between 3500 and 5100 animals, not all of which will be mature individuals. Until 1994, its status was "endangered". See http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/4257/0. - Mod.AS

Barasinghas are cervids from the Indian subcontinent, originally widely distributed, but now limited to 4 relict populations. These individuals were kept in captivity (the fact that the headline says they died at a "National Park" is misleading). - Mod.PMB
