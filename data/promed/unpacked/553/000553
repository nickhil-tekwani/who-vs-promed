British dogs will not be put down if their owners get Ebola and expose them to the virus, according to official Government guidance issued by the Department of Health.

The Department of Health has issued official guidance which says the idea that the animals of anybody in the UK who gets Ebola are also at risk is a myth.

Instead, the advice says that pets of people with Ebola will not be immediately put down but will instead be quarantined to ensure they have not themselves contracted the disease.

It comes after there was widespread outrage that the dog of a Spanish nurse who contracted the virus was put down after Spanish authorities claimed it could have spread the disease.

[The Spanish nurse] survived the deadly virus after she became the 1st person to contract it outside Africa while treating 2 infected missionaries. She and her husband were quarantined but her dog was not offered the same treatment and was put down at the beginning of October [2014].

Spanish people were so angry that the dog had been put down, 100 000 people sign[ed] a petition calling for Spain's health minister to resign over the order to kill the dog.

The advice reads: "Myth -- If anybody in the UK gets Ebola, any animals they own are also at risk.

"There is thought to be a low risk that companion animals (particularly dogs) in developed countries, can become infected with Ebola and then transmit it to other people.

"However, there are plans in the UK, to quarantine dogs that may have been exposed to Ebola, should that be necessary."

The American Veterinary Medical Association put out official guidance this week emphasising that animals have not contributed to the outbreak of the virus in West Africa.

It says that pets should be quarantined if they have been in close contact with someone infected with Ebola. If the pets test positive for the lethal virus, they should be put down. The American advice recommends that pets should be confined to a crate or kennel inside a secure facility and stripped of all clothing and collars that could have possibly been contaminated.

Pets that have been in close contact with Ebola-infected people should be quarantined and -- if they test positive -- euthanized, according to new guidance issued [Wed 12 Nov 2014] by a veterinarians' group.

The American Veterinary Medical Association compiled the guidance after a dog in Spain was euthanized because its owner contracted Ebola and a dog belonging to an infected nurse in Dallas was quarantined and then released. The guidelines say a pet that may have been infected should be quarantined, away from other animals, for 21 days. The animal's handlers should wear protective equipment similar to what's worn by hospital workers who treat Ebola patients.

Ebola testing for animals must be authorized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the group said. If an animal does test positive, it should be killed and the body incinerated, the guidelines say.

Scientists believe Ebola can be transmitted to people through infected animals, and the 1st human infections in Africa are believed to have come through contact with fruit bats, apes, or monkeys.

The CDC says there have been no reports of dogs or cats becoming sick with Ebola or being able to spread it to people or other animals. But health officials say they don't know whether a pet's paws, fur, or other body parts can pick up and transmit the virus.

Ebola is spread person-to-person through direct contact with blood or other body fluids from someone sick with the virus.

[Guidelines for the handling of an animal that has been, or is suspected to have been exposed to human Ebola patients deserve to be established upon science-based criteria, which relate to both human and animal health. The above mentioned guidelines refer to the mode of action to be taken "if they (the animals) test positive". It will be helpful to note on which tests the status (positive, negative, suspected) of such an animal is to be responsibly defined, and whether such tests have been validated for the species involved. The same refers to the number of isolation days (why 21?), etc.

Experimental infection trials may have to be considered if solid knowledge is to be established and binding guidelines officially adopted.

At present, the lacunae in such knowledge seem significant. An exposed dog may be kept alive provided the severe biosafety conditions are secured; basing crucial decisions upon observations in a single dog, suspected to be exposed, is debatable. - Mod.AS
