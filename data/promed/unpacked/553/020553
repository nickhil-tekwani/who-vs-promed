Further Analysis of Variable Sites in Isolates of SARS Virus
------------------------------------------------
As noted in my previous post [see: SARS - worldwide (68): etiology
20030425.1010], one hot-spot for variation among SARS coronavirus
isolates is position 5768 in the orf1ab gene product [the viral
polymerase]. In that position a E [Glu] is found in isolates
CUHK-W1, GZ01, BJ01, BJ02, BJ03, and BJ04. All 6 of these isolates
are closely linked to mainland China. In contrast, the isolates
linked to the Metropole Hotel in Hong Kong (Urabani, Tor2, YKY, and
possibly HKU-39849) all have a D [Asp] at that position.
A review of [corresponding] sequences of [other virus species in the
family _Coronaviridae_ ] indicates that this position is well
conserved [with 4 strains of bovine coronavirus (LUN, ENT, Quebec,
Mebus)] and human coronavirus (229E), all having an E at that
position, like the mainland isolates [of the SARS coronavirus].
However, 5 strains of murine hepatitis virus (A59, 2, ML-10, ML-11,
Penn 97-1, JHM) all have a D at that position.
Thus, this position is well conserved within species, and the fact
that 2 sets of human isolates have distinct amino acids at this
position is likely to be significant and may explain the virulent
nature of the isolates that established SARS in Hanoi, Toronto,
Singapore, and possibly Hong Kong.
The position is also species-specific [in coronavirus isolates from]
pigs (Purdue, PUR-46-MAD, CV777) and chickens (Beaudette, LX4), all
of which have a P [Pro] at that position.
Of interest is a similar situation at position 244 in E2 [a putative
glycoprotein]. This region is not well conserved in isolates other
than SARS, but of the 10 SARS isolates, the 6 mainland isolates have
a T [Thr], whereas the other 4 have an I [Ile], suggesting this is
another hot-spot.
The above data strongly suggest that the amino acids found at
position 5768 are not due to sequencing errors and that the position
change may have biological and clinical consequences.

[Dr. Niman has observed a regularity in amino acid substitution at
position 5768 in several isolates of SARS virus and in isolates of
some other species in the family _Coronaviridae_, which perhaps has
some biological significance. It is premature to conclude, however,
that this particular site (and the others discussed by Dr. Niman) has
any direct relevance to the epidemiologic characteristics and
virulence of the SARS virus. ProMED-mail is not a suitable vehicle
for discussion of fine sequence analysis of this type, despite its
inherent interest. Therefore, with regret this thread is now cut. -
