A potentially deadly form of community acquired pneumonia linked to
adenovirus type 14 has emerged in the Pacific Northwest.
First encountered in 2005 in Oregon, the viral pneumonia frequently leads
to hospitalization and has a 20 per cent fatality rate, Paul Lewis, MD, of
the Oregon State Public Health Department said at the Infectious Diseases
Society of America (IDSA) meeting [see: Lewis P, et al: Adenovirus 14: a
new cause of severe community-acquired pneumonia. Infectious Diseases
Society of America 45th Annual Meeting. 4-7 Oct 2007. San Diego. Final
Program and Abstracts. Abstract LB-5].
"We recommend obtaining a viral culture in pneumonia patients who lack a
specific etiology, especially those with severe disease," said Dr Lewis.
"If adenovirus 14 is detected, anticipate a stormy course. We encourage an
infectious disease consultation to discuss the risks and benefits of any
specific therapy that might be contemplated."
Recognition of the adenoviral pneumonia began with 4 patients hospitalized
simultaneously at a Portland hospital. Upon comparing notes with physicians
at area hospitals, Dr Lewis and colleagues "almost fell out of our chairs
because every hospital we called had recent severe and fatal cases of
adenovirus disease." Investigators followed up the informal communication
with a systematic review of all cases of adenovirus disease identified by
Oregon clinical laboratories from November 2006 to April 2007. 6 months of
active surveillance revealed what appeared to be a winter-spring
predominant adenovirus disease, as the number of reported cases increased
from January through April. Isolates from the sickest patients were sent to
the CDC (US Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention), which found that
almost all the cases involved adenovirus 14, a serotype identified more
than 50 years ago but rarely detected since then and never in association
with outbreaks.
Dr Lewis and colleagues at the state health department reviewed analyzed
specimens dating back to 1993 and found a few cases of adenoviral disease
almost every year. Beginning in 2005, adenovirus 14 was the predominant
serotype identified. Comparison of 31 patients with adenovirus 14 disease
and 14 patients with other adenovirus serotypes showed that adenovirus 14
tended to infect older men (median age 52.9), and almost half the cases
involved smokers. Most strikingly, adenovirus 14 was associated with a
hospitalization odds ratio of 15.9 compared with other adenovirus
serotypes. The most common clinical features leading to diagnosis of
adenovirus 14 disease were fever (about 80 per cent), tachypnea (75 to 80
per cent), hypoxia (about 50 per cent), and hypotension (40 to 45 per
cent). Chest x-rays were abnormal in 23 of 24 cases. Radiographic
progression was common, including single-lobe disease to multilobe in 55
per cent of cases and lobar disease to adult respiratory distress syndrome
in 45 per cent.
All patients received broad spectrum antibiotics. Dr Lewis said 22 of the
31 patients with adenovirus 14 disease were hospitalized, and 16 required
ICU (intensive care unit) care. Median hospital and ICU length of stay was
7 days. Of the patients treated in the ICU, 13 required ventilatory support
and 8 had severe hypotension requiring pressor drugs. 7 patients (22 per
cent) died. Risk factors for death or ICU care were a creatinine level
greater than 1.2 mg/dL, lymphocyte count less than 100 microL, and
coinfection with another pathogen. None of those factors remained
statistically significant in multivariate analysis.
"This came out of nowhere in 2005 in Oregon," said Dr Lewis. Acknowledging
that almost all of the cases have involved severe illness, he agreed that
the scope of the problem could be much larger and involve a broader
spectrum of illness severity.

[The abundance of reports of avian and seasonal human influenza virus
infections has tended to obscure the fact that many other viruses can be
responsible for outbreaks of serious respiratory disease. This report
identifies human adenovirus 14 (classified as a member of the _Human
adenovirus B_ species) as the cause of an outbreak of serious disease in
the north western state of Oregon in the United States. Human adenovirus 14
has not previously been regularly associated with human respiratory
disease. It is perhaps too soon to designate human adenovirus 14-associated
pneumonia as an emerging disease rather than perhaps a co-factor in an
unusual disease situation. Nonetheless extended investigation and continued
surveillance are clearly warranted. - Mod.CP
