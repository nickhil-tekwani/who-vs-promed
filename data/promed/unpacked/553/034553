Even though the drought has not affected cattle in Thirthahalli taluk [administrative district], as is the case in other drought-affected taluks of Shivamogga district, the death of 2 heads of cattle at Araga village recently has set off alarms in the district. However, a thorough investigation conducted by the Obscure Disease Research Center, Shivamogga, has revealed they [the cattle] died after consuming the toxic _Ficus tsjahela_ leaves.

This is not the 1st such incident reported in the district, despite awareness being created among cattle owners. The Obscure Disease Research Center says on average, 40 head of cattle died after consuming these leaves in the district. Principal Investigator and Head of Obscure Disease Research Center Dr. NB Shridhar told The New Indian Express if the disease is diagnosed and treated immediately, cattle can be saved, or else they die within 24 hours of consuming these leaves.

"The disease is also called 'lightning disease'. The signs are similar to rabies," he said. Shridhar said the toxin from _F. tsjahela_ leaves causes salivation, excitement, continuous twitching of palpebral muscles, hyperaesthesia, frequent jaw movements and restlessness, among others. He said _F. tsjahela_ is found in Malnad area. The tree grows in villages.

[The description of the clinical signs provided in the article are suggestive of seizure activity, for which there are multiple causes.

While this type of fig tree appears common in this area of India, there are several articles and reports of toxicity in cattle. The articles report seizures or seizure-like activity. A study of the leaves' phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of steroids, terpenes, diterpenes, lactones, flavonoids, tannins and glycosides. A few articles dealt with finding the appropriate antidote in cattle.

Cattle in India find this plant perhaps palatable, either because of lack of other forage or by taste choice. So, if cattle cannot be prevented from consuming this plant, although it is reportedly a yard plant, then an antidote to the seizure activity is needed. Several articles indicated studies came to the same conclusion: Affected animals were treated effectively with diazepam at 0.5 mg/kg IV and thiamine hydrochloride at 10 mg/kg IM with intravenous administration of 5-10 mL/kg of 10% dextrose solution twice at 10- to 12-hour intervals for 3-4 days until complete recovery. Because of the seizures, or seizure-like activity, the dextrose seemed to speed recovery, as did the thiamine. It was suggested diazepam at 1 mg/kg IV every 8-10 hours would also get the cattle over the induced seizure-like activity if the other adjunct treatments were not available, but recovery may take longer.

Any animal having uncontrolled and repeated seizures can die from this type of neurological disturbances.
