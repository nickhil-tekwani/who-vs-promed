Tests clear 6 of deadly hendra virus infection
----------------------------------------------
Initial tests have cleared 6 people who may have been exposed to the
deadly hendra virus on Queensland's Sunshine Coast, while 3 others
are still waiting for results.

A horse diagnosed with hendra [virus infection] was put down on a
Tewantin property on Monday [17 May 2010]. A total of 9 people
including a mother and daughter came into contact with the horse
while it was sick. Queensland Health says preliminary tests on 6
people showed no sign of the virus. 3 more are awaiting their initial
test results.

But all 9 people will needed to be tested again in about 3 weeks.
Initial test results for the remaining horse on the quarantined
property at Tewantin have also come back negative. The horse will
remain under quarantine until the incubation period has passed and
all tests have returned negative.

A total of 4 people have died from the virus in the past 15 years,
including [a 33 year old] vet, who died in August 2008 while working
at the Redlands Veterinary Clinic east of Brisbane. Another outbreak
at a Cawarral property near Rockhampton in central Queensland last
August [2009] claimed the life of veterinarian Dr Alister Rodgers,
55, and killed 4 horses.

The Federal Opposition's agriculture spokesman, Senator John Cobb,
says the Government should fund a vaccine. "The Australian Veterinary
Association and ourselves are calling upon the Federal Government to
make sure another AUD 600 000 [USD 500 551] is available for the
CSIRO [Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
Organisation] to produce a usable vaccine to stop horses transmitting
this deadly virus to human beings," he said.

Queensland's chief veterinarian Ron Glanville says this time of the
year is the start of the risk period for hendra virus [transmission].
"The research we're doing now where we're basically collecting urine
from flying fox colonies shows from now on is probably the highest
risk period," he said. "They're still rare events -- I think the most
number of cases we've ever had in any particular year is 2."

Queensland Health and biosecurity officers will be attending a pony
club event at Caloundra today to address public concerns over the
latest outbreak. Meanwhile, the Queensland Horse Council says hendra
virus outbreaks are prompting vets to leave the industry.

Council president Debbie Dekker says the virus poses an ongoing
concern. "We find that vets are pulling out of equine business,
people with mixed practices that used to do small animals and horses
are pulling out of the equine side of it," she said. "The minute you
haven't got health practitioners to look after your animals, that
spells a very tricky problem for the future of any industry." Ms
Dekker says the most recent outbreak will have a flow-on effect. "It
has a dramatic impact on the future of the industry because I mean
it's a very, very dangerous virus," she said. "Any time a horse is
sick, it is a potentially fatal disease for humans so that brings the
fear factor in."

[The results of 3 outstanding tests for the 9 potentially exposed
individuals are awaited. It would seem from the preliminary results
for 6 of the 9 exposed persons that the risk of transmission of
hendra virus infection by casual contact with a sick animal is low.
Information on the prospects for development of a hendra virus
vaccine for use in equines or humans would be appreciated.
