The total number of drug addicts who have died in Scotland after being
infected with anthrax has reached 10. The latest death was confirmed in the
NHS Fife area by Health Protection Scotland.

A fresh case has also been reported in a heroin user in the NHS Dumfries &
Galloway board area -- the 1st such incident in the region. It brings the
total number of cases in the UK to 26, with all but 2 of them in Scotland.

The outbreak began with the identification of cases in the NHS Greater
Glasgow & Clyde area in December [2009]. It has since spread to NHS board
areas in Ayrshire and Arran, Fife, Tayside, Forth Valley, Lanarkshire, and
now Dumfries & Galloway.

Health experts have said there is no way to tell if a batch of heroin is
contaminated, and no measures can be taken to make it safe. They have
advised addicts to stop taking the drug "if at all possible".

One new case, one further death in ongoing anthrax outbreak
-----------------------------------------------------------
A further case of anthrax has been confirmed in a heroin user in Scotland,
bringing the total number of cases in Scotland to 24. This case occurred in
the NHS Dumfries & Galloway board area and the individual is currently
receiving hospital treatment. This is the 1st case in NHS Dumfries &
Galloway, indicating that the outbreak is continuing to spread in Scotland.

In addition, one patient in the NHS Fife area who was previously confirmed
as having anthrax has now died, bringing the total number of deaths in
Scotland among confirmed anthrax cases in this outbreak to 10. A further 2
cases have been confirmed in England linked to the use of heroin, one in
London and one fatal case in Blackpool. This makes the total number of
cases in the UK 26 with 11 deaths.

The spread of the outbreak to another new area of Scotland emphasises that
contaminated heroin appears still to be in circulation and underlines the
need for heroin users to understand the risks of continued use of heroin.

Confirmed cases by NHS board area (total: 24) (deaths)
NHS Ayrshire and Arran - 1 (0)
NHS Dumfries & Galloway: 1 (0)
NHS Fife: 2 (1)
NHS Forth Valley: 1 (1)
NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde: 12 (6)

[The case fatality rate is staying around 50 per cent, which reflects how
the addicts infect themselves by injection and the probability that the
contamination is "chunky": in anthrax lethality is a direct function of
dose. Past experience suggests that new cases will appear over the next
couple of months. - Mod.MHJ]
