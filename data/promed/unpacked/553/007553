--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COVID-19 has left little time for reflection about lessons to be learned. This coronavirus has provoked us, mobilised us, and distracted us. But with a vaccine on the horizon, it's perhaps time to pause. What have we discovered this past year? And how do these discoveries inform our future? Our annual Lancet-Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences conference -- held virtually last week -- provided a moment for such contemplation.

Gabriel Leung underlined the phenomenon of East Asian exceptionalism. Why had countries such as China, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea performed so much better than those in the west? "Sociological imprinting", he suggested. The region has been a point of origin for so many new infectious diseases. People were primed to act and ready to accept government mandates. Luzhao Feng showed how the Chinese strategy of "zero-COVID-19" worked. Initial rapid containment followed by suppression. The principal threat now is from imported cases. Border controls and screening are high priorities. Till Baernighausen explained how classic public health functions -- surveillance, isolation, and health promotion -- were relearned and reinvented. Surveillance became contactless. Isolation was delivered through Fangcang shelter hospitals [large-scale, temporary hospitals]. And health promotion used wordless interventions, such as education-entertainment videos.

Holger Schuenemann emphasised the importance of being transparent about uncertainty. An example: mask wearing. Pooling evidence suggests that masks might reduce risks of coronavirus spread by 14%. But that evidence is of low certainty. The potential impact of mask wearing also depends on virus exposure. In areas of low exposure, masks may not be necessary. In areas of high exposure, they may be a wise precaution.

Jie Qiao explored the lessons of COVID-19 for child health. Her conclusions were chilling. Newborn children were separated from their mothers for over a month at the height of the pandemic. The potential effects of COVID-19 on infant motor, cognitive, personal, and emotional development are serious and severe. Bin Cao argued that the long-term consequences of COVID-19 -- physical, social, and psychological -- are real and important.

The existence of "long-COVID" should not be surprising for a virus that affects multiple organs. Roy Anderson looked ahead to vaccine distribution. Herd immunity is the impact of the fraction of those who are immune on the rate of transmission of the virus. He estimated we will need to achieve 60-70% immunity to be safe. Vaccination should begin in cities. It will take 2-3 years to "mop up" the virus. Which groups should receive the vaccine first depends on the context. In high-income countries, it makes sense to prioritise older citizens. But in a country like Kenya, you might start with younger ages. Wei Cun discussed how 2nd-generation COVID-19 vaccines are already being designed. It is unlikely that vaccines soon to be approved will be the same as those used in years to come. Simiao Chen made clear that even with a vaccine we will still need non-pharmaceutical interventions -- some measure of physical distancing; an effective test, trace, and isolate system; the adoption of facility-based isolation, widely used in Asia, but not at all in western countries; and clear communication and education. Wenbo Xu warned of the risks of reintroducing coronavirus through hidden importation in cold chain products. Winnie Yip drew attention to the continuing risks for older people. Physical distancing in care homes is almost impossible. Isolation has disproportionately severe effects on the mental health of older citizens. And even partial lockdowns interrupt necessary patterns of care. Zhenguo Zhai focused on the importance of improving the quality of clinical care for those with COVID-19. The rapid development and implementation of clinical guidelines will save lives. And Zhong Liu illustrated how research in the middle of a pandemic -- his example was the efficacy or not of convalescent plasma -- can be immediately informative for refining clinical care.

Finally, Jeff Sachs, who leads The Lancet's Commission on COVID-19, connected the importance of stopping the pandemic and understanding its humanitarian challenges with a wider set of no less urgent issues -- the deep scarring of economies and cutting a path towards recovery. The lessons we learned from this Chinese-western collaboration were only a beginning. These exchanges must be part of a much larger effort to make sense of what has happened to us. But it was a beginning, nonetheless.

[A thought provoking piece, especially on trying to explain "East Asian exceptionalism". The predominance of outbreaks and transmission of the 1st SARS-CoV in 2002 and 2003 was felt to have been "fortunate" to have occurred in countries with the observed ability to implement control measures and enforce compliance, resulting in interruption of transmission of the virus in 80 months. Unfortunately SARS-CoV-2 is more easily transmittible, with peak virtual loads seen in asymptomatic infections and in pre-symptomatic individuals so a reliance on symptom screening misses the overwhelming majority of infections. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the "cat was out of the bag" before it was recognized and 218 countries and territories had infected individuals within 3-4 months. Other thought-provoking presentations surround the societal impacts as critical and the humanitarian aspects surrounding the outbreak, something that frequently gets lost in technical discussions amongst scientists (non social scientists). And yes, the likelihood is that the vaccines we will use to interrupt transmission now, most likely will not resemble those used several years from now, although the new technology may persevere.- Mod.MPP]

[2] ANTICOV: Pan Africa clinical trials
Date: Thu 3 Dec 2020 3:45 PM
Source: Science [edited]
https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/12/first-its-kind-african-trial-tests-common-drugs-prevent-severe-covid-19


Hundreds of drug trials around the world have been testing possible COVID-19 treatments, but almost none have been in Africa. Now, researchers on the continent are mounting a large effort to try to answer a crucial question that has gotten relatively little attention: Could cheap, widely available drugs prevent patients with mild illness from becoming severely sick?

"This is the 1st major drug trial across the continent," says epidemiologist John Amuasi, who leads the Ghanaian arm of the Africa-wide project, named ANTICOV. "I would have liked this to come much earlier, but it's really great that this is happening."

What is raising some eyebrows, however, is one of the 1st drugs to be tested: the malaria treatment hydroxychloroquine, which several other studies have concluded is not effective in preventing or treating COVID-19.

When SARS-CoV-2 started to spread across the world, many worried that the virus' impact would be particularly devastating for African countries. "Many of us scientists in Africa were actually calling for trials at the very early stages, because we were concerned that we were going to be the hardest hit," says Amuasi, who works at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in Kumasi, Ghana. The pandemic even fueled fears that Africa would become a testing ground for unproven and potentially risky therapies and vaccines. In the end, however, the opposite happened: Africa fared much better than Europe or the Americas in terms of per capita deaths and infections from COVID-19, and researchers launched few clinical trials there.

ANTICOV, launched in late September [2020], aims to recruit thousands of patients in 13 countries. It focuses on testing cheap drugs that could keep patients out of hospitals. If large numbers of patients progress to severe disease that requires oxygen or ventilation, the result "would be a catastrophe" for health systems in Africa, says Nathalie Strub-Wourgaft of the nonprofit drug development group Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative [DNDi], which is coordinating the trial.

Specifically, ANTICOV aims to find a drug that reduces the likelihood of mild COVID-19 cases progressing to severe illness by 50%, Strub-Wourgaft says. The investigators hope to test a long list of drugs, including the hepatitis C drug sofosbuvir, the antiparasitic drugs nitazoxanide and ivermectin, and colchicine, which is used to treat gout. The 1st to be tested, however, are the HIV combination drug lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine.

Patients who come to participating hospitals for any reason will be tested for COVID-19 and invited to enroll in the trial if they test positive. Participants will be given one of the study drugs or paracetamol, a widely used painkiller, for 21 days. They can report symptoms daily using an app or answer questions by phone. If they exhibit breathlessness or other symptoms, they may be called back to the hospital. If their oxygen saturation drops below 94% at any point, that will be a mark against the drug they are on. In some countries these patients will then be enrolled in the World Health Organization's trial for hospitalized patients, called Solidarity.

So far, only the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has started its trial and enrolled about 150 patients. Over the next few months, a dozen other nations, including Sudan, Uganda, Mozambique, and Mali are expected to join. Kenya is slated to start recruiting next week. The 1st patients in Ghana should be enrolled in early 2021, Amuasi says. Researchers will run an interim analysis on data from the 1st 300 patients and repeat the analysis with each additional 450 patients. The researchers plan to add more treatment arms to test other drugs, and to drop drugs from the study once they reach preset criteria for success or futility.

ANTICOV will prioritize testing hydroxychloroquine even though 2 large clinical trials -- Solidarity and the United Kingdom's even larger Recovery trial -- have clearly shown that it doesn't help hospitalized patients. The drug also failed to prevent infections or to help patients with mild symptoms in several smaller trials. "I personally would not start with hydroxychloroquine," says Martin Landray, an epidemiologist and physician at the University of Oxford and one of the principal investigators of the Recovery trial. "There have been so many studies of it and none of them have shown any hint of any promise."

Still, hydroxychloroquine is alluring for many reasons. "It's a very cheap drug, and it's produced largely from a resource that is abundant in Africa," Amuasi says. (The largest plantations that grow the quinine-producing plants used to make the drug are in the DRC.) And it is still being used in some African countries to treat COVID-19, so a negative result in ANTICOV might help to put any lingering questions about the drug's effectiveness to rest. "I would be very surprised if the results of this trial do not provide the final answer," Amuasi says.

Even if hydroxychloroquine isn't the best drug to start with, studies like ANTICOV are vital, Landray says. "We have to find treatments that are widely available, widely affordable, and scalable for a pandemic," he says.

Because several vaccines are now considered efficacious, running another trial with a placebo group is ethically questionable, he concedes. Still, such trials are necessary, Amuasi says, because the high genetic diversity in African populations and a lack of local resources may mean that vaccines turn out to be less effective than in Europe or the United States. Scientists need to know, Amuasi says, "that what we see in the global north is what we also see in the global south."

[More detailed information on the ANTICOV initiative can be found at the Drugs for Neglected diseases Initiative website (https://dndi.org/research-development/portfolio/anticov/). Trials will be held at 19 sites in 13 countries," involving 26 prominent African and global research and development (R&D) organizations, coordinated by DNDi." The list of partner organizations and funders can be found at the ANTICOV webpage link.

There is mention of the plan to study the controversial use of hydroxychloroquine and the recognition that the drug is being used widely in many African countries. Large studies addressing the question of preventing progression to severe disease have not been done and the plan is to put this controversy to bed.

In the event drugs are identified as preventing more serious disease it will have global implications. We await results of these trials.

A good map of Africa can be seen at https://geology.com/world/africa-satellite-image.shtml. The 14 countries with the highest cumulative case counts (more than 15 000 cases) in the African Region are South Africa, Ethiopia, Kenya, Algeria, Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon, Uganda, Cote d'Ivoire, Zambia, Madagascar, Senegal, Mozambique, and Angola (using the WHO daily updates). Partner institutes and entities identified in this initiative include representation in Cameroon, Mozambique, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Senegal, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Tanzania, Sudan, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, and Ghana. - Mod.MPP]

Brazil passes 176 000 deaths attributable to COVID-19; 17 states and the Federal District are showing an increase in reported deaths
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The media consortium released a new survey of the situation of the coronavirus pandemic in Brazil based on data from the state health departments, consolidated at 8:00 pm on Saturday [5 Dec 2020].

The country reported 660 deaths attributable to COVID-19 during the preceding 24 hours, bringing the total deaths due to COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic to 176 641. With this report, the moving median daily number of deaths reported in Brazil over the past 7 days was 579. The change in the median number of reported deaths for the 7 day period beginning 14 days earlier is an increase of 20%, indicating a trend for increasing numbers of reported deaths over the week following a stable period.

In terms of cumulative confirmed cases, since the beginning of the pandemic, 6 576 699 Brazilians have been infected by the SARS-CoV-2, with 41 748 of these cases confirmed in the past 24 hours. The moving median number of daily newly confirmed cases was 40 934 new confirmed cases per day. This represents an increase of 37% in relation to the cases reported in the past 2 weeks which indicates a trend for increasing numbers of cases [and increased ongoing transmission of the virus].

17 states and the Federal District are showing increases in the median moving averages in reported deaths.

[This detailed data analysis explains the observed increases in daily reported cases (and deaths) we have been seeing following the WHO and Worldometer data. Climate-wise the southern states are entering their summer time with more outdoors available, and the entire country is entering the tropical rainy season. One suspects that like elsewhere, pandemic fatigue has set in, combined with political passivity to explain the increasing trends.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 218 (Samoa has not been added as yet)].

Data by country, area, or territory for 6 Dec 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesDEC6_1607312957.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 50.9% of daily case numbers and 45.2% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours but maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 28.0 million cases. The USA continues to dominate, followed by Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, and Canada. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases include Panama, Peru, Chile, Ecuador, Costa Rica, and Paraguay. And countries/territories reporting more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000 in the past 24 hours include Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Guatemala.

- The European region reported 33.6% of daily case numbers and 40.1% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 19.9 million. Countries not reporting cases today (6 Dec 2020) include Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, and Kazakhstan. Countries reporting more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours include Russia, Italy, Germany, UK, France, Poland and Ukraine. There are 20 additional countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours and 8 countries reporting reporting more than 500 but less than 1000 cases.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.2% of daily case numbers and 6.0% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 4.28 million cases. Iran maintains its dominance, with daily totals now beginning to drop from more than 13 000 to more than 12 000, followed by Morocco, Jordan, Pakistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Palestinian Authority, the UAE, and Tunisia. Oman, Libya, Sudan, Yemen, and Somalia have not reported any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The African region reported 1.4% of daily case numbers and 1.5% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.54 million cases. South Africa maintains its dominance with increased case reporting (over 4000 in the past 24 hours), followed by Algeria, Kenya, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Uganda, DR Congo, Namibia, Niger, Mali, and Senegal. Ghana and Cameroon among other countries did not report any cases in the past 24 hours

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.0% of daily case numbers and 0.57% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.91 million cases. Japan is maintaining its dominance with more than 2400 cases confirmed in the past 24 hours, followed by Philippines, Malaysia, South Korea, and China.

- The South East Asia region reported 7.9% of the daily newly reported cases and 6.6% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 11.07 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia (with more than 6000 cases confirmed in the past 24 hours), Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Thailand, and the Maldives.

Impression: Basically, unchanged on the regional levels, with the continued dominance of Europe and the Americas region representing over 84% of both newly confirmed cases and newly reported deaths in the past 24 hours. At the country level, Japan is the dominant country in the Western Pacific region; Russia and Italy maintain dominance in the European region. Indonesia has been increasing daily reports in the South East Asian region. The USA maintains its position as the country reporting the most cases on a daily basis and Brazil has been increasing daily reports. All of this is apparent as the weekend reporting decrease is starting with multiple countries not reporting any cases or markedly reduced (Belgium always reports but over the weekend there are 2-6 cases reported in a 24 hour period.

On the Overview tab at the WHO source URL, the epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases by WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 6 Dec 2020, is an excellent visual representation of the pandemic. - Mod.MPP]

[In the past 24 hours, there has been a 13.8% decrease in the number of reported newly confirmed cases and a 28.3% decrease in the number of newly reported deaths in the past 24 hours consistent with our weekly observed weekend reporting artifact. Countries not reporting any new cases in the past 24 hours include Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, Costa Rica among others.

In the past 24 hours the USA (176 104), India (32 272), and Turkey (30 402) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 7297 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (5-6 Dec 2020).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (11 countries) include the USA, India, Turkey, Russia (29 039), Brazil (26 363), Italy (18 887), UK (17 271), Germany (14 750), Ukraine (11 590), Iran (11 561), and France (11 022). A total of 53 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours down from 62 on Fri 4 Dec 2020); 25 of the 53 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 10 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and one from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 5.8%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 7.2% -- even with reduced reporting. The USA has increased both newly confirmed cases (21.3%) and reported deaths (52.6%) which is most likely related to increased transmission over the Thanksgiving weekend [26-29 Nov 2020] with travel and gatherings held in spite of advice not to. The 7-day average daily new cases reported in the USA is 201 304 and newly reported deaths is 2262. Prior to today (6 Dec 2020), the USA has reported more than 200 000 new cases daily over the preceding 5 days, and over 2500 deaths per day over the past 5 days, and today (6 Dec 2020) represented over 32.7% of all newly reported cases.

Impression: The global daily reported cases continue to increase with over 600 000 newly confirmed infections reported daily for the previous 5 days. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. The USA continues to show uncontrolled transmission. Disconcerting is the continued increases in reported cases and deaths in spite of reduced reporting over the weekend. The increases in the USA are alarming, to say the least.- Mod.MPP]
