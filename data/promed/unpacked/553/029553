Preliminary data indicate that Escambia County's rate of sexually transmitted diseases [STDs] will once again surpass the annual, per capita state average [https://www.pnj.com/story/news/2020/01/13/pensacola-no-61-top-100-cities-highest-std-rates-report/4425002002/].

The Florida Department of Health in Escambia County is still finalizing data pertaining to the number of STDs that county residents contracted and reported to health-care providers during 2021. But provisional numbers already suggest that Escambia County STD rates will remain high, and that the area experienced a significant increase in the percentage of reported cases of syphilis.

Health-care professionals are currently calculating an 85% increase in the number of Escambia County residents who contracted syphilis in 2021, compared to in 2020.

It's worth noting that, statistically, only a small portion of Escambia County's 300 000-plus population is impacted. In 2020, health department officials recorded 100 cases of syphilis in Escambia County, and provisional numbers suggest the number of syphilis cases in the county grew to 185 in 2021.

Still, Patty Dwiggins, director of the Florida Department of Health's Area 1 STD Program that encompasses Escambia, Santa Rosa, Okaloosa, and Walton counties, said Escambia County residents need to take the possibility of contracting a STDs extremely seriously. "When you look at the Florida average compared to our average, Escambia consistently is above the Florida average for all of the different disease entities: chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis," Dwiggins said.

A total STD rate for the area is calculated by collectively tallying the county's cases of syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.

There is some measure of good news for Escambia County when it comes to STDs. Health-care workers are currently calculating an overall 5% decrease in the county's total 2021 STD rate. The estimated decline in the total rate is due to a decrease in in the number of reported chlamydia and gonorrhea cases. In 2020, there were 2231 cases of chlamydia and 1216 of gonorrhea recorded in Escambia County. In 2021, there were an estimated 2101 cases of chlamydia and 1122 cases of gonorrhea in Escambia County. If those initial estimates hold true, it would mean that chlamydia cases decreased by about 5.8% and gonorrhea cases decreased by 7.7% between 2020 and 2021.

But still, Dwiggins said, it is far too early to start celebrating these declines. "Right now, the data is showing us a slight decrease in chlamydia and gonorrhea but not enough to show us a trend of any sort," Dwiggins explained. "Even if we have 5% lower than last year, if the provisional number proves to be accurate, that is enough of a trend to me to feel real excited about. One year to the next is not a trend. We've got to see that downward trend for several years for us to feel like, oh wow, things are really moving in the right direction. If you have things bounce up 2 years in a row, but then bounce slightly one year, then go right back up the next year, that's not a trend, obviously."

Escambia County's 2020 STD rate per 100 000 was 30% higher than the Florida average and has exceeded the state average every year dating back to 2006, the earliest year for which STD is accessible through a Florida Department of Health online data base. A study conducted by California-based Innerbody Research using 2019 CDC data, ranked Pensacola No. 38 on a list of US metro areas with the highest STD rates in the country [https://www.innerbody.com/std-testing/std-statistics?msID=4cb303e9-5359-426d-b6ac-fcf1ccc6f923].

Dr. Wesley Farr, a lecturer for the Department of Public Health at the University of West Florida, said health-care professionals have witnessed rising STD rates across the country since the 1990s. "The increase we are seeing now has been a relatively steady increase that we've been seeing over the past 20 to 30 years," he said.

During his 4-decade career, Farr has worked as a specialist within the field of infectious diseases at both hospitals and academic institutions. "Gonorrhea rates and syphilis rates dropped considerably through the '80s and most of the '90s," he explained. "The biggest change happened after 1996, when the 3-drug regimens of highly active retroviral treatment for HIV infections was introduced." The new medications to combat HIV, he said, changed people's perspective on the virus and gradually tapered society's collective reservations about unsafe sex. "With effective medications, people's practices changed, and they didn't follow safe sex practices strictly. And since then, we have seen a steady increase in gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia over the last 20 to 25 years," Farr said.

[For a discussion of syphilis in the United States, please see my moderator comments in prior posts listed in the "See Also" section below.

We are not told in the news report above the characteristics of the population infected with syphilis or factors that are placing them at risk of infection in Escambia County, Florida. More information would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

In the late 1980s, in Escambia County, Florida, the number of early syphilis cases reported per quarter increased from 15 in 1987 to 75 in 1990 (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001989.htm). The outbreak was linked to use of crack cocaine, multiple anonymous sex partners, and exchange of sex for money or drugs.

In recent ProMED posts, illicit drug use has been cited as a contributing factor for increases in syphilis cases in both the United States and Canada (see the "See Also" section below). Illicit drug use is associated with sexual behaviors that increase the risk for acquiring syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases, including having multiple anonymous sex partners, inconsistent condom use, and exchange of sex for drugs or money.

In my moderator comments in prior ProMED posts on syphilis in the USA, I noted that Florida was one of the states in which the rate of congenital syphilis (64.8 per 100 000) was above the national average (48.5 cases per 100 000) in 2019 (see Table 40, https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2019/tables/40.htm).

Escambia County (pop., 297 619 in 2010) is the westernmost county in the US state of Florida. It is in the state's northwestern corner (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escambia_County,_Florida); its largest city and county seat is Pensacola (est. pop. 52 975 residents in 2019) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pensacola,_Florida). Escambia County is home to a large United States Naval Air Station, the base of the Blue Angels, a flight demonstration team of the US Navy, and the National Naval Aviation Museum.
