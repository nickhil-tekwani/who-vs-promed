Bird flu spreads to 6th Vietnamese province
-----------------------------------------------
Bird flu has been confirmed in poultry in a 6th Vietnamese province
despite efforts by the government to stop it from spreading.
The Animal Health Department said in a report on Sunday [14 Jan 2007]
the H5N1 bird flu virus had been found in ducks in the Mekong Delta
province of Tra Vinh, extending the spread of bird flu in southern
provinces in recent weeks.
Tra Vinh is adjacent to Vinh Long province, where bird flu struck a
chicken farm a week ago.
Officials have confirmed outbreaks of the virus in ducks and chickens
in 4 other Mekong delta provinces further southwest of Ho Chi Minh
City, where market inspectors have restricted the movement and sale of poultry.
Viet Nam has had no human H5N1 cases since November 2005, but the
virus that 1st hit the Southeast Asian country in late 2003 reemerged
last month [December 2006] in Mekong delta poultry.
Agriculture officials have warned the country's 84 million people
that the virus could spread nationwide via migrating birds.
The risk of infections could also rise before the Tet Lunar New Year
festival in mid-February 2007, where the slaughter and eating of
poultry is a traditional part of the new year's feast.
Bird flu killed 42 of the 93 people infected in Viet Nam in
2003-2005. It has killed 159 people globally since 2003, according to
the World Health Organization, spreading from Asia to Europe, the
Middle East and Africa.

Crested Goshawk tested for H5 virus
-------------------------------------------
Preliminary testing of a dead bird found in Shek Kip Mei has
indicated a suspected case of H5 avian influenza, a spokesman for the
Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department said today (13 Jan
2007). Further confirmatory tests are still being conducted.
The carcass of the crested goshawk was collected by department staff
at the hill behind Shek Kip Mei Health Centre on 9 Jan 2007, after
being alerted by a member of the public.
Members of the public are reminded to observe good personal hygiene.
They should avoid personal contact with wild birds and live poultry
and clean their hands thoroughly after coming into contact with them.

[The crested goshawk (_Accipiter trivirgatus_) is a bird of prey in
the family _Accipitridae_, which also includes many other diurnal
raptors such as eagles, buzzards and harriers.
The crested goshawk breeds in southern Asia from India and Sri Lanka
to south China, Indonesia and the Philippines. It is found in Kam
Shan Country Park of Hong Kong. It is a forest bird that builds a
stick nest in a tree and lays 2 or 3 eggs.

This particular species seems not to have been previously found
infected by H5N1; another family-member, the northern goshawk
_Accipiter gentilis_, was found infected in Dranske, in the northern
part of the island of Rugen, Germany in February 2006. See archive
