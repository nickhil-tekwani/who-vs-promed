[This is the 2nd part of the daily update following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on selected countries of interest. To reduce the size of these posts, there will be changes over the coming days. The tables will be reduced but are available at the source URLs and will be referred to in the summaries of daily changes for each country. Countries that have almost interrupted transmission and have been lifting restrictions (China, South Korea) and have lessons to learn as they attempt to prevent explosive 2nd waves will continue to be profiled. We will attempt to select countries from each region on a daily basis. - Mod.MPP]

[According to the report above, in the past 24 hours, there have been 3 newly confirmed cases in China, all imported. No new deaths were reported. Also, 1 new case was reported in Hong Kong, none in Macau. A total of 1783 imported cases have been reported. There have been no new deaths reported for several weeks, further supporting a reduced level of cases in the country.

There were 21 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals in the past 24 hours, 2 were imported. There was 1 case of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The recent previous reports of a conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic were on 4 ad 6 Jun 2020 when 1 conversion was reported each time. Prior to that, there were 2 cases on 1 Jun 2020, and a single case was reported on 18 May 2020 (COVID-19 update (194): China, S Korea, countries w/ high local trans, Italy phase 2 20200519.7352327).

Recurrent questions: What is the total number of asymptomatic cases? What is the total number of asymptomatic cases that converted to symptomatic? What is the proportion of asymptomatic imported cases that have been linked to transmission chains resulting in outbreak clusters?

Epidemiological investigation revealed that a person who visited the table tennis court in Yangcheon-gu, Seoul City [28 May 2020] attended service at Big Tree Church in Yongin-si, Gyeonggi Province [31 May 2020]. Based on this finding, the 2 clusters are now classified together and renamed as "Yangcheon-gu sports facility." *Related to the table tennis facility (22); Related to Big Tree Church (19).

- Happy Care Home in Gwangju-si, Gyeonggi Province, 1 additional case confirmed, a resident of the care home, under isolation at hospital. In total, 9 cases confirmed to date. *2 care workers, 6 residents, 1 social worker.
- Student of Won Mook High School in Jungnang-gu, Seoul City confirmed on [7 Jun 2020]. Testing is underway for approximately 800 people including students, staff, family, friends, and acquaintances.
- Student visited Lotte World Adventure on [5 Jun 2020]. People who visited Lotte World Adventure during 12:15-21:00 on Friday [5 Jun 2020] have been notified and instructed to get tested at a screening clinic via emergency/public safety alerts on mobile devices. Students and staff who have visited the facility have been requested to stop going to school until their test results are available.
- Recently, COVID-19 transmissions are occurring through various venues such as religious small group meetings, club meetings, door-to-door sales group meetings in Seoul Metropolitan Region (Seoul and nearby areas) with high population density and foot traffic. If the transmission continues and occurs at a highly crowded and confined space with a large number of people, a massive outbreak may occur at any time.
- Recent outbreaks have emerged from confined, poorly ventilated areas where activities that make a large amount of respiratory droplets travel in air, such as singing, eating, snacking, and sporting took place. Mask wearing, hand hygiene, and other preventive measures were not closely followed.
- Since COVID-19 outbreaks can occur from any venue under crowded, confined, and close-contact environments, residents of the Seoul Metropolitan Region are advised to postpone social plans and gatherings or use non-face-to-face alternatives, and avoid using public venues such as restaurants and bars.

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 38 cases and 1 new death, compared with 38 cases and no new deaths in the previous day (7 Jun 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 64 consecutive days. Today's (8 Jun 2020) breakdown of cases: 35 cases were locally transmitted, and 3 were imported cases. Locally acquired cases were in Seoul (18), Gyeonggi (12), Incheon (3) and 1 each in Chungnam and Gyeongnam. Imported cases were in Seoul (1), Gyeonggi (1), and Chungnam (1). Note that 12 provinces and Quarantine did not report any newly confirmed cases.

The detailed discussions of the clusters following the opening up of venues clearly illustrates the increased risk of transmission in enclosed, indoor venues with high density, including houses of worship.

The impression (hasn't changed): Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. It just takes one super spreader in a crowded place to transmit and lead to a sizeable cluster.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 235 278 cases, including 33 964 deaths, up by 197 cases and 65 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (7 Jun 2020) 24-hour change was 197 cases and 53 deaths, and on 5 Jun 2020 was 270 cases and 72 deaths, potentially consistent with weekend reporting artifacts. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are still in decline. As it has been, the major increase in cases was in Lombardy, reporting 194 newly confirmed cases, again with the caution that there may be weekend reporting artifacts here.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country (see table at http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4870_1_file.pdf), in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Lazio, Piedmont, and Liguria. These 5 provinces combined today (8 Jun 2020) account for 92.1% of reported newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (194) and was the only province reporting more than 50 new cases. Also, 16 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (7 provinces reported no new cases), with another 4 provinces reporting fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission.

The top 5 provinces by cumulative case count remain unchanged and are Lombardy, followed by Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Tuscany. The top 5 provinces by number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours are Lombardy (194), followed by Emilia-Romagna (20), Lazio (16), Liguria (14), and Piedmont (14).

Italy is now 35 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 19 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up.

[4] Iran: 173 832 total cases, 8351 deaths
Date: Mon 8 Jun 2020 13:39 TRT

https://www.geo.tv/latest/292164-iran-told-to-wear-masks-as-virus-toll-mounts


Iran on Monday [8 Jun 2019] urged its citizens to wear masks in public as it announced another 70 deaths from the novel coronavirus and 2043 new cases of infection. Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said the latest figures took the overall toll to 8351 dead out of a total of 173 832 people infected.

"Everybody must wear masks when attending places like stores or any other place where it is not possible to observe social distancing carefully," he said on state television.

Since announcing its 1st cases in the holy city of Qom in February [2020], Iran has struggled to contain what quickly became the Middle East's deadliest outbreak of the COVID-19 illness. It initially imposed a series of measures aimed at halting its spread, such as the closure of mosques, but has gradually rolled back many of these steps since April [2020].

The Islamic republic said on Sunday [7 Jun 2020] that a recent upsurge in cases was due to increased testing rather than a worsening outbreak. Rising infection figures since a low in early May [2020] and lax observance of social distancing have worried authorities, which have reiterated calls for strict adherence to health protocols.

"The majority of provinces are in a stable situation," Jahanpour said on Monday [8 Jun 2020]. He said the southwestern province of "Khuzestan is still red," the highest level on the country's colour-coded risk scale. Eight other provinces were "on alert," he said. "The provinces at risk should be more serious and cautious," Jahanpour said, calling on people to avoid unnecessary travel.

[As of 8 Jun 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 173 832, including 8351 deaths, an increase of 2043 new cases and 70 deaths since 7 Jun 2020. There is a discrepancy in math for the number of deaths reported, as yesterday's [7 Jun 2020] figure was 60 deaths fewer than today's. This is not the 1st time this has happened. Iran has started relaxing restrictions on a more widespread basis in the country. With the increasing daily case reports having surpassed the prior peak in late March-early April 2020, it is clear that there is now a 2nd wave, most likely due to too early lifting of restrictions. The key concern will be whether people begin travelling again within the country and may transport the virus from one zone to another. So far, it appears as although the daily case counts are decreasing and may reflect the impact of tightened control measures in affected provinces.

The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 2 026 493, including 113 055 deaths, an increase from 2 007 449 cases and 112 469 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 204 253 as of 13:00 EDT on 7 Jun 2020 (an increase of 434 newly confirmed cases since 7 Jun 2020, up from 309 on 6-7 Jun 2020) including 17 169 confirmed deaths (an increase of 23 deaths since 7 Jun 2020 and down from 33 deaths on 6-7 Jun 2020) and an additional 4708 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are California, Texas, New York, Florida, New Jersey, North Carolina, Arizona, Illinois, Georgia, and Virginia.

In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Texas, Florida, Michigan, and Maryland, the same 10 states as of yesterday (7 Jun 2020) but in a slightly different order. A total of 35 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.
