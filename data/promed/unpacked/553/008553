[1] New Zealand (South Island): ex Indonesia (Bali) alert

Health officials have issued a measles warning after a Christchurch [New Zealand] man contracted measles while holidaying in Bali [Indonesia].

Results from laboratory testing released today [18 May 2017] confirmed the 23-year-old man has measles.

Dr Ramon Pink, Canterbury Medical Officer of Health, says measles is highly infectious.

"The measles virus spreads easily from person to person through the air, via breathing, coughing, and sneezing. It starts with fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes, and sore throat. This is followed by a rash that spreads over the body," Dr Pink says.

People who aren't fully immunised are being asked to keep a close eye out for measles symptoms and anyone who was in the areas listed above are urged to phone their doctor if they are concerned.

The case is currently in isolation and his infectious period ends on [21 May 2017].

An unvaccinated toddler had an infectious case of measles on a flight from Jakarta [Indonesia] to Melbourne [Australia], and Victorian health experts want anyone with symptoms to seek treatment.

Victoria's deputy chief health officer Brett Sutton says the 3-year-old was admitted to hospital on the weekend [20-21 May 2017] after flying into Melbourne on Garuda Indonesia flight GA 716 on [13 May 2017].

"Anyone developing symptoms is advised to ring ahead to their GP or hospital first and tell them that they have fever and a rash," Mr Sutton said in a statement on [Mon 22 May 2017].

"If you know you have been in contact with a measles case, please alert your GP or hospital emergency department."

In a statement issued to doctors and hospital emergency departments about the incident, it says the toddler acquired the infection while in Indonesia and medical staff should be prepared.

"Be alert for measles in patients presenting with a fever at rash onset, particularly associated with international travel," Dr Sutton said.

"Isolate suspected cases to minimise the risk of transmission within your department/practice."

Measles symptoms usually present similarly to common cold symptoms which develop into a rash 3 to 7 days later.

The health department says people aged 26 to 42 have the lowest immunisation coverage to the disease but those of any age who are immunocompromised are also at higher risk. This includes people undergoing cancer treatment or on high-dose steroids.

Most cases of measles in Victoria are linked to international travel.

The epidemic measles recorded almost 400 new cases and 1 death at national level last week [week of 15 May 2017], the authorities announced on [Fri 19 May 2017].

The total number of measles cases has reached 6124 since the outbreak of the epidemic on 30 Sep 2016, according to the National Center for Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases (CNSCBT).

There were 26 deaths because of measles during this period. Most of them were in the Timis county, namely 8.

The measles epidemic is closely related to Romania recording severe shortages in the supply with the mandatory vaccines. Health minister Florian Bodog said yesterday [21 May 2017] that the need for vaccine doses amounts to 400 000 until the end of this year [2017]. He added that authorities have managed to identify 109 000 vaccines so far, which have been sent to the public health departments. Another 300 000 doses will be acquired from abroad and distributed based on requests.

Romanian authorities buy 109 000 doses of anti-measles vaccines

A teenager who visited Bergen County [New Jersey] from an unidentified foreign country earlier this month [May 2017] came down with measles -- and may have exposed others to the highly contagious disease, the NJ Department of Health warned late [Fri 19 May 2017].

The 16-year-old stayed at the Ramada Rochelle Park at 375 West Passaic St in Bergen County. Hotel guests who were there 12 May through 11 am 13 May 2017 may have been exposed to measles. In addition, the teenager was hospitalized at The Valley Hospital in Ridgewood. There, exposure may have occurred to visitors who were there from 9 am 13 May until 1 am 14 May, and again on 15 May from 3 to 5 pm.

People who came in contact with this person could develop symptoms as late as [5 Jun 2017].

The hospital is now in the process of contacting individuals who may have been exposed.

Measles remains a common disease in many parts of the world, including areas in Europe, Asia, the Pacific, and Africa. There were 3 cases reported in New Jersey in 2015, the last year for which statistics are available.

Although measles has technically been eradicated in the United States, dozens of cases are "imported" each year. Last year [2016], 70 people in 16 different states came down with measles, and measles made headlines in 2015 when it was spread to visitors to Disneyland.

A case of measles has been reported at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, DC, according to the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.

The health department says the patient contracted measles outside of the United States, developed symptoms here in the country and their diagnosis was confirmed [Fri 19 May 2017]. "Out of an abundance of caution," the health department says it is informing people who may have been in certain locations.

[The dates, times, and locations of the potential exposures associated with the patient who was diagnosed with measles can be found at the source URL above. - Mod.LK]

According to the health department, the patient was admitted to Children's National on [13 May 2017], and was appropriately isolated for the majority of their hospitalization. ...more]

It is critical for public health practitioners to increase awareness of risk of severe disease following natural infection with measles when an individual has not been immunized with the full vaccine series. In addition, doctors must impress upon their patients the importance of vaccination not only for each individual, but also for public health, and dispel myths perpetuated by those who do not know or understand the science.

It is equally important that vaccine shortages are prevented, as is occurring in Romania. According to CDC, reasons for vaccine shortages are multi-factorial and include companies leaving the vaccine market, manufacturing or production problems, and insufficient stockpiles. - Mod.LK]
