European countries are calling for widespread vaccination against
deadly bluetongue disease. On Wed 26 Sep 2007, agriculture ministers
from the Netherlands, Belgium, France, and Germany will ask the EU to
approve widespread vaccination.
But to stop a bigger outbreak next year [2008], animals must be
vaccinated in spring before infected [_culicoides_] which spread the
disease start swarming. And the vaccine may not be ready, because the
plant in the UK that makes it has been shut following safety concerns.
As climate has warmed, bluetongue has spread into countries such as
Spain and Italy. In July 2006, it broke out for the 1st time in the
Netherlands, and quickly spread to Belgium, Germany, France, and Luxembourg.
In August 2007, it hit those countries again. With infected animals
near the Belgian coast experts predicted that infected midges could
reach the UK. Since 22 Sep 2007, 2 cows with bluetongue have been
confirmed on a farm near Ipswich, UK, [and a 3rd cow in Lowestoft --
see ProMED archive Bluetongue, bovine - UK (England) (04): BTV-8
20070925.3179 -- and a 4th in a different farm near Ipswich -- see
next item below.- Mod.AS/JW]
Because of previous outbreaks in southern Europe, the
[American-French] vaccine manufacturer Merial started developing
vaccines 3 years ago, with initial money from the European
Commission. Spanish and Italian farmers have been using them
successfully for several years, says Philip Connolly, a Merial spokesman.
There are 24 immunologically distinct "serotypes" of bluetongue virus
-- vaccine against one does not work against another. European
farmers vaccinate against serotypes 2 and 4. The UK and northern
Europe have been hit by serotype 8, apparently from Sub-Saharan
Africa. But there is a vaccine for that. "We decided last January
[2007] to start serotype 8 vaccine development," says Connolly. "The
vaccines to [serotypes] 2 and 4 work well, so we are confident this
will be just as effective." He likens the switch in serotype to the
changes in each year's flu vaccine, which do not require separate testing.
"We had every intention of having the vaccine ready for early 2008,"
Connolly told New Scientist. "But our factory isn't allowed to touch
live virus." The vaccine is made from killed bluetongue virus. The
plant at Pirbright where Merial manufactures it was implicated in an
escape of foot-and-mouth disease virus in August [2007], and the
plant has shut down all work with live viruses since.
"We would have to be back up and running by late October [2007] to do
it in time," says Connolly. Another vaccine company, Intervet [in the
Netherlands], has developed a serotype 8 vaccine, but will not have
an approved plant in time.

Bluetongue: positive test results received
------------------------------------------
Defra [Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] has today
[26 Sep 2007] received positive test results for bluetongue for a 4th
animal on a 3rd premises near Ipswich, Suffolk. This animal will be culled.
At this stage, there is not sufficient evidence to confirm an active
outbreak [see comment below] of bluetongue as it cannot yet be
demonstrated that the disease is circulating. Epidemiological
investigations are ongoing to establish whether bluetongue disease is
circulating in the UK.
Action will be in line with the UK Bluetongue Control Strategy,
published in August [2007], but will also take account of the current
FMD [foot-and-mouth disease] restrictions.
It remains essential for animal keepers to practice the highest
standards of biosecurity, remain vigilant for disease and report any
suspicions immediately. Livestock owners should examine their
livestock twice a day.

[For subscribers' convenience, the following is some information
derived from the August 2007 document "UK Bluetongue Control
Strategy" (available at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/notifiable/pdf/bluetongue-control-strategy0807.pdf>).

To try to understand the reasoning for the actions taken so far by
Defra in its initial response to suspected (and confirmed) infection,
the following explanatory text, from article 1.5 "Suspicion of
Bluetongue Infection", may be helpful:
"Irrespective of the origin or the means of introduction of the
initial infection, the initial response to suspicion of infection
will be similar as it is unlikely the origin of infection will be
immediately obvious (unless it is an imported animal).
However, 4 distinct scenarios are likely to occur at the start of a
new outbreak:
1. Investigation on premises where disease first suspected
2. Pre-confirmation of disease, that is, virus has been isolated from
a suspect case, but it has not been possible to demonstrate
circulation to other animals, therefore, disease will not necessarily
be confirmed in the UK.
3. Disease not confirmed as no evidence of onward circulation of
virus. (and virus positive animal slaughtered)
4. Disease confirmed."
It seems that combined Defra scenarios 2 and 3 are prevailing.
Additional background for the interested subscriber is included in
the following 2 articles from said document.
"1. Article 1.8.1, "Criteria for Confirming Disease"
----------------------------------------------------
Circulation of disease will not necessarily be confirmed with the 1st
identified case, further epidemiological investigations may be
required to prove circulation in local animal and vector populations.
To confirm the circulation of disease, the decision would be taken by
the CVO [chief veterinary officer], taking into account, amongst other things:
- number of infected animals
- geographical distribution of disease
- movement history of infected animal(s)
- veterinary history of infected animal(s)
- sero-prevalence in herds/flocks
- vector data / meteorological conditions
- other epidemiological information".
"2. Article 2.2, "Slaughter of affected animals"
------------------------------------------------
Slaughter of susceptible animal(s) infected with bluetongue might, in
some circumstances, be considered as a control measure, for example,
in the context of a single infected imported animal where no further
disease is detected (as a precautionary measure to try to stop
disease establishing).
The decision would be taken by the relevant CVO (or Ministers in
Scotland), based on the epidemiological circumstances, a veterinary
risk assessment of the confirmed case, and the views of the livestock
industry. It would not be expected to form part of our control
strategy beyond the earliest stages of an outbreak (although each
case would be judged on the situation at the time).
Severely affected animals may need to be slaughtered for animal
welfare reasons. The keeper should get advice and treatment from a
private veterinary surgeon for such animals".
Note: the term "active outbreak" is not to be found anywhere in the
document. - Mod.AS]
