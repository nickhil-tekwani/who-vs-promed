As the number of leptospirosis infection increases nationwide, health
secretary Enrique Ona cautioned the public, particularly in flooded
areas, against the dreaded disease.

>From January to 24 Sep this year [2011], the Department of Health
recorded at least 2061 cases of leptospirosis with 156 casualties.
This number is 195 per cent higher than the number of cases in the
same period of last year (699 cases).

"Leptospirosis is an infection commonly transmitted to humans from
water that has been contaminated by animal urine (usually rats), and
comes in contact with lesion[s] in the skin, eyes, or with the mucous
membranes," Ona said.

Most of the cases came from Western Visayas (824 cases), National
Capital Region (411), Central Luzon (166), and Davao (131). Ages of
infected individuals ranged from less than one year to 77 years. Most
(30 per cent) of the victims belonged to the 20-29 years age group,
and majority (88 per cent) were male.

The signs and symptoms of leptospirosis include fever, chills, and
intense headache. These appear within 4 to 14 days after exposure to
contaminated flood waters or even mud. These may be accompanied by red
eyes, jaundice, tea-colored urine, and difficulty in urinating. In
extreme cases, complications like meningitis, renal failure, and
respiratory distress may arise and lead to death.

In heavily flooded areas, the DOH distributed antibiotics as
preventive measure to avert fatal complications. Likewise, the early
treatment will be helpful to people who are asymptomatic or those who
do not exhibit normal signs and symptoms of infection. As another
protective means, the public is advised to wear protective gears such
as boots and long pants in wading through flooded roadways to reduce
the risk of infection. This, as the bacteria usually finds their way
through abraded skin or open wound.

"The rains are not yet over and many areas are still flooded because
of the recent typhoons. So, we are reiterating our advice to the
people to watch out for these signs and symptoms and go to the nearest
health facility to have themselves checked up," Ona concluded.

[The following is extracted from the moderators ML's comments in
ProMED-mail post Leptospirosis - Philippines (02): (Manila,ZN) 20110716.2154:

Leptospirosis is a disease associated with freshwater flooding. The
Philippines is regularly battered by tropical cyclones that bring
flooding to large portions of the country
(http://blogs.voanews.com/breaking-news/2011/06/25/15-missing-thousands-displaced-in-philippines-flooding/).
The typhoon season normally runs from late May to early December.

Leptospirosis is caused by swallowing _Leptospira_ in contaminated
water or on food, or by absorbing it through cuts in the skin.
Doxycycline has been found to offer some protection against severe
illness. In a flood-affected area, leptospirosis chemoprophylaxis is
doxycycline 200 mg, once a week for those exposed to contaminated
floodwater or soil. Each 200 mg dose provides a benefit for up to 7
days, so the dose may be repeated if high-risk conditions persist
longer than this.

People exposed in flooded fields should be cautioned against direct
contact with contaminated water or mud and should be advised to use
rubber shoes or boots and gloves. Broken skin should be protected with
a waterproof dressing. All food and drinking water should be protected
against contamination. All drinking water should be boiled unless it
is known to be absolutely safe. Fresh vegetables and fruit should be
washed in clean water and then cooked or peeled. _Leptospira_ exist in
the urine of several 'reservoir' species, most commonly rats, but also
other rodents, cattle, pigs, sheep, and horses. It is usually spread
by the urine of a carrier animal that contaminates water or food.
Because rodents are the major reservoir of _Leptospira interrogans_,
rodent control measures should be undertaken.

Clinical diagnosis is difficult because of the varied and non-specific
presentation. According to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC)
(http://www.bt.cdc.gov/disasters/disease/leptoclin.asp): "The
diagnosis of leptospirosis should be considered in any patient
presenting with an acute febrile illness with fever, chills,
conjunctival suffusion, headache, myalgias and/or jaundice. The
diagnosis is more difficult when patients present with symptoms of
cough, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
arthralgias and a skin rash. Conjunctival suffusion and muscle
tenderness, most notable in the calf and lumbar areas, are the most
distinguishing physical findings.

"Any patient meeting the following clinical criteria with exposure to
flood waters [possibly contaminated with animal urine, such as
exposure to floodwaters following a hurricane] should be tested.

"Clinical criteria for leptospirosis:
Fever > 38.0 deg C (100.4 deg F) and at least 2 from COLUMN A or one
from COLUMN B
COLUMN A / COLUMN B
Headache / Aseptic meningitis
Myalgias / Acute renal failure
Jaundice / Hemorrhagic pneumonitis
Chills/Rigors / Cardiac arrhythmias, EKG abnormalities
Skin rash / Liver failure
Conjunctival suffusion without purulent discharge / Jaundice with
acute renal failure (Weil's disease)"

However, because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical
presentation of leptospirosis, its diagnosis cannot be made
confidently without laboratory confirmation. The U.S. CDC can provide
Leptospira Dip-S-Tick (DST) IgM dot-ELISA test kits (PanBio Integrated
Diagnostics) to local laboratories for serological testing of
suspected leptospirosis cases in support of the response to a
disaster. The DST is suitable for in-the-field testing of suspected
patients. Confirmatory testing uses the microscopic agglutination test
(MAT).
