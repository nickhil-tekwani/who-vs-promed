There have been more than 1.5 times as many confirmed flu cases so far this year [2019] than in the whole of 2018, new data shows.

But despite the surge in early cases, experts say this year's season is not worse than average, and an early start to flu season could mean an early end.

This year [2019] to date there have been 97 920 laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza across Australia, compared with 58 870 cases for the whole of 2018, according to the latest data from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS).

In the fortnight to [16 Jun 2019], there were 19 353 new cases of influenza alone -- "substantially higher" compared to the same period in the previous 5 years, according to the latest influenza surveillance report.

Experts say there are a number of reasons there have been so many influenza cases across Australia already this year.

Professor Robert Booy, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Sydney, said having 3 strains in circulation -- influenza A(H1N1), influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B -- "certainly makes things worse."

Another explanation, Professor Booy said, was that immunity is lower due to the quiet flu season in 2018. "We went from a very busy to a very quiet year, and as a consequence, as the virus mutates and changes the level of immunity in the community starts to fall off again, and therefore we may have a lot more susceptible people," he said.

There were also record numbers of summer flu cases, according to NSW [New South Wales] health director of communicable disease, Vicky Sheppeard. On top of that, she said the winter flu season started much earlier than normal.

"It started in the 2nd week of May 2019, so we're seeing the number of cases in June that we'd normally be seeing in August," Dr Sheppeard said.

The number of people being admitted to hospital with influenza is also high for this time of year.

Between [1 Apr and 16 Jun 2019], 840 people were admitted to hospital with confirmed influenza, and 146 of those people were admitted in the 2 weeks to [16 Jun 2019] -- more than 3 times the 5 year average for the same fortnight. There have also been 192 influenza-associated deaths so far this year, as reported to the NNDSS.

However, the total number of deaths, hospitalisations, and cases of influenza is also higher than these numbers suggest as not all influenza cases are reported, but Professor Booy said data collections and estimates have been improving every year.

"Every year we do more testing -- GPs do more testing, hospitals do more testing every year -- so we're getting closer to a more accurate estimate," he said.

Dr Sheppard said the number of hospitalisations and deaths from influenza were certainly high for the time of year, but were about average when compared to the number of influenza cases.

"In 2017 we saw an unusually high number of hospitalisations and deaths, whereas so far 2019 is more tracking along the average flu season, but just earlier than we'd normally see it," she said.

While it was hard to predict due to a different mix of viruses, Dr Sheppeard said this year's flu season could potentially end earlier.

"Normally flu seasons peak about 6 weeks after they start, and last about 12 weeks, 14 weeks," she said. "We can really only monitor it, but we're hoping that it will peak in the next couple of weeks and then the numbers will start to decline."

Professor Booy said influenza strains were constantly being analysed through the World Health Organisation flu collaborating centre in Melbourne, to check how the viruses were mutating and how well they were covered by the current vaccine.

While a flu vaccine won't prevent people from getting influenza 100 per cent of the time, Professor Booy said it does make a difference. "Essentially you can halve the risk of catching flu by vaccination," he said." It's not perfect, but it's more than helpful."

Flu deaths in NSW [New South Wales] have surged past 50, as outbreaks continue to hit the most vulnerable and impact emergency departments across the state.

To date, a total of 32 236 people have been diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed flu, according to the latest data from NSW Health.

This is almost twice the total number of flu cases recorded in all of 2018.

The latest weekly Influenza Surveillance Report shows there were 4617 flu cases for the week ending [23 Jun 2019], up from 4101 notifications the previous week.

To date, there have been 57 influenza-related deaths.

Last week alone [week of 24 Jun 2019], 7 people died of flu-related illnesses, with most of the deaths recorded among the elderly.

Emergency departments are also being impacted by the high number of flu cases. There have been more patients presenting to NSW emergency departments so far in 2019 than in any other 6-month period.

Health authorities are urging people to get vaccinated before visiting the elderly and to stay home if they are ill.

In the year [2019] to date, there have been 87 confirmed flu outbreaks in aged-care facilities, 12 of which were reported last week.

"The elderly are highly vulnerable to influenza and the flu jab is critical to reducing the risk of visitors catching the virus and bringing it into aged-care homes," said NSW Health Director of Communicable Disease, Dr Vicky Sheppeard.

"If you are unwell with the flu, stay at home and minimise contact with other people if possible, especially those who are particularly vulnerable, such as the elderly until you have recovered."

According to the latest report by the state health department, 4 more people succumbed to swine flu [influenza A(H1N1)] in the state [Maharashtra] in the past 3 weeks, taking the toll to 189 till [27 Jun 2019].

Of these, Pune has recorded the highest -- 44 deaths -- followed by Nagpur (34), Nashik (31), Mumbai (18), and Kolhapur (12).

The transmission of the virus, experts say, is likely to rise during the monsoon as the drop in temperature provides a conducive atmosphere. "We have intensified our surveillance, so there is no need to panic," a state health official said.

"People should maintain healthy habits, exercise regularly, and sleep properly. Frequent hand-washing is a must during this period, as monsoon provides a conducive set-up for all kinds of influenza viruses, including [influenza A(H1N1)]," Mandeep Chadha, senior scientist at National Institute of Virology, said.

Officials said 1705 people had tested positive for the contagion in the state since the beginning of the year [2019]. "The season can spur transmission of viruses, including the [influenza A(H1N1)] virus. People should exercise caution," senior family physician Prakash Mahajan said.

Moreover, weakening immunity among the masses and the co-circulation of other seasonal viruses, along with [influenza A(H1N1)], are among the contributing factors. "People should be on the alert for persistent or worsening flu symptoms, particularly if one has other risk factors such as obesity or a compromised immune system," critical care expert Prasad Rajhans said.

"Delay in seeking treatment has been the cause for quite a few [influenza A(H1N1)] deaths reported in Pune since January this year [2019]. Often, patients go to doctors only after developing breathlessness and after their condition has worsened. Precious time is wasted in the 1st few days of showing symptoms, when treatment is crucial," Ramchandra Hankare, medical officer of health, Pune Municipal Corporation said.

[4] USA & vaccine recommendations

Influenza activity in the United States during the 2018-19 season and composition of the 2019-20 influenza vaccine

The 2018-19 influenza season was a moderate severity season with 2 waves of influenza A activity of similar magnitude during the season: A(H1N1)pdm09 predominated from October 2018 to mid-February 2019, and A(H3N2) activity increased from mid-February through mid-May. Compared with the 2017-18 influenza season, rates of hospitalization this season were lower for adults, but were similar for children.

Composition of the 2019-20 influenza vaccines
---------------------------------------------
Vaccine recommendations were made based on factors including data from global influenza virologic and epidemiologic surveillance, genetic characterization, antigenic characterization, and the candidate vaccine viruses that are available for production. WHO recommended the northern hemisphere 2019-20 influenza vaccine composition, and the Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biologic Products Advisory Committee subsequently made the influenza vaccine composition recommendation for the United States. Both agencies recommend that influenza trivalent vaccines contain an A/Brisbane/02/2018 A(H1N1)pdm09-like virus, an A/Kansas/14/2017 A(H3N2)-like virus, and a B/Colorado/06/2017-like (B/Victoria lineage) virus. The quadrivalent vaccine recommendation included the trivalent vaccine viruses and a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like (B/Yamagata lineage) virus. The A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) recommendations are an update to the 2018-19 northern hemisphere vaccines. The decision to update the A(H1N1)pdm09 component was made because of genetic and antigenic characterization data using individual post-vaccination human sera, which demonstrated significantly reduced titers (eightfold or greater) to recent 6B.1A viruses, compared with the titers against the A/Michigan/45/2015 vaccine virus. The decision to update the A(H3N2) component was made to address antigenic drift of the virus with emergence and spread of A/Kansas/14/2017-like viruses (3C.3a).

The seasonal influenza (flu) vaccine is designed to protect against the 3 or 4 influenza viruses that research indicates are most likely to spread and cause illness among people during the upcoming flu season. Flu viruses are constantly changing, so the vaccine composition is reviewed each year and updated as needed, based on which influenza viruses are making people sick, the extent to which those viruses are spreading, and how well the previous season's vaccine protects against those viruses.

More than 100 national influenza centers in over 100 countries conduct year-round surveillance for influenza. This involves receiving and testing thousands of influenza virus samples from patients. The laboratories send representative viruses to 5 World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centers for Reference and Research on Influenza.

Twice a year, the World Health Organization (WHO) organizes a consultation with the Directors of the WHO Collaborating Centers, essential regulatory laboratories, and representatives of key national laboratories and academies. They review the results of surveillance, laboratory, and clinical studies, and the availability of vaccine viruses and make recommendations on the composition of the influenza vaccine. These meetings take place in February for selection of the upcoming northern hemisphere's seasonal influenza vaccine and in September for the southern hemisphere's vaccine. WHO recommends specific vaccine viruses for inclusion in influenza vaccines, but then each country makes their own decision about which viruses should be included in influenza vaccines licensed in their country. A lot of effort and planning goes in the process, but vaccine mismatches do happen when there are sudden drifts in one or more of the vaccine components, affecting its efficacy. - Mod.UBA]

The National Cancer Institute (ION), announced on [Thu 27 Jun 2019] that visits will be restricted to one relative per due to the outbreak of influenza A(H1N1) virus and other hospitals are following suit.

To date, the Ministry of Health (MINSA) has reported the death of more than 12 people, the last of them residents of Cocle with ages of 55, 79, and 91 years, and there are another 16 patients with influenza in that province.

Through social networks, the ION has called on the population to comply with the basic preventive hygiene measures, to reduce the risk of acquiring influenza and other diseases, such as vaccination against influenza in health centers and clinics of the Social Security Fund.

In addition washing your hands often with soap and water or using alcohol gel, cover your mouth and nose, when sneezing or coughing (use disposable handkerchief, or the internal angle of the elbow to retain droplets ejected, avoid unnecessary contact, such as greeting kisses and handshaking and early attention minimizes the risk of complications.

Minsa authorities recommend that visitors to health facilities should limit their time within the infrastructures and refrain from visiting patients in hospitals.
