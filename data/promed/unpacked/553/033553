[This BTV-3 event, located in Teulada, South Sardinia, Sardinia was covered in ProMED-mail posting 20181004.6070734. However, the location of outbreak no. 1 (BTV3_2018_8_CA_78, see URL above) was indicated as Teulada, South Sardinia, Apulia. This is probably a typographical error, as the city of Teulada is in the region of Sardinia; nevertheless, this should be clarified. - Mod.CRD
