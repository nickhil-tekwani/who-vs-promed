The World Health Organisation (WHO) added its voice on Friday to the chorus
of warnings over Belgian food contaminated with toxic chemical dioxin,
urging consumer prudence over certain types of food with high fat content.
But the Geneva-based United Nations (UN) health agency admitted it was
unable to assess the full extent of the crisis due to lack of information
and research capability.
The European Commission (EC) has slapped restrictions on Belgian chicken
and eggs and this week widened them to order the removal from sale of pork,
beef and milk products that might be tainted by dioxin.
The WHO said it had not been informed by the Belgian authorities on what
might have caused the contamination.
"We don't have any information on the levels and extent of the actual
contamination," WHO food safety expert Gerry Moy told the same news
conference.
"The analysis of these types of chemicals, besides being expensive,
requires specialized laboratory equipment. Few laboratories currently have
this capability. Consequently, the analytical data is generated very
slowly. I don't think at the present time we have representative values for
the exposure."
"Our advise would be to err on the side of caution. When we know the facts,
we can do a full health risk assessment," he said. Jenny Pronczuk, a
chemical safety expert at the WHO, said member countries were worried about
food products coming from the European Union (EU) such as chocolate,
powdered milk and chicken nuggets.
Because dioxin is fat-soluble and accumulates in fat tissues, the experts
said the WHO was advising consumers not to eat too much of food products
containing substantial amount of fat such as dairy products and meat with
high fat content.
The WHO recommends a tolerable daily dose of dioxins equivalent to a range
of 1 to 4 picograms per kilogram of body weight. One picogram is
one-trillionth of a gram.
Based on an average European diet, the increase from eating a single egg
would contribute about a 1.4-percent additional level of dioxin to the
total body weight, said the WHO.

Dioxin, the carcinogen that has contaminated Belgian eggs, chicken and
other foods, is a chemical with a notorious past. It was present in some
batches of Agent Orange, the herbicide spread by US forces during the
Vietnam War. It rained down on villagers near Seveso, Italy, after a
chemical plant exploded in 1976. It was found in the dumping ground known
as Love Canal in 1978, creating a cordoned-off ghost town in upstate New
York.
One of the most toxic and persistent substances known, dioxin is measured
and regulated in picograms - trillionths of a gram.
While the WHO has set a "tolerable daily intake" of 1 to 4 picograms of
dioxin per kilogram of body weight, it acknowledges there really is no such
thing as a "safe" dose of dioxin because the chemical accumulates in the
body, increasing the risk of cancer and reproductive and nervous system
disorders over time.
The WHO reference, said Dr. Ri Deridder, a member of the health minister's
staff, is "a life-long measurement." While no health experts expect any
immediate toxic reaction from these doses, it was not known at what
accumulated level any individual might be harmed.
Nevertheless, the Belgian Health Ministry said on Wednesday that it planned
to convene on Monday "an international expert panel" to determine what
level of daily dioxin intake might be considered acceptable on a short-term
basis, allowing it to release some possibly tainted foods now in
storage.According to the Belgian government, chickens testing positive for
dioxin showed 700 to 1,000 picograms of dioxin per gram of fat.
By WHO standards, a person weighing 75 kilograms (165 pounds) would have a
tolerable daily intake of up to 300 picograms of dioxin. If he ate 100
grams (3.5 ounces) of the most contaminated chicken cited, and presuming a
chicken is about 5 percent fat, he would have consumed about a 16-day
allotment of dioxin.
Dioxin is in a class of poisons called persistent bioaccumulative toxins,
such as lead and mercury, that are not excreted by plants or animals - or
people - but build up in the body. Dioxin gravitates to fatty tissue. Once
it is ingested, there is no way to remove it. The chemical has a "half
life" in the body of about seven years - that is, half of it degrades over
that time.
Only pregnant women excrete some of the substance - it enters the placenta
and breast milk, thus being passed along to the infant. Likewise, cows that
ingest dioxin in grass or feed would pass it along in their milk.
A by-product of modern industrial processes and the incineration of trash,
dioxin is now present everywhere - in the air, in the soil and in the food
chain. The family of 75 chemically related compounds called dioxins comes
from the burning of resins that contain chlorine dioxin, found in most
plastics.
Dioxin may be formed during the chlorine bleaching process at pulp and
paper mills, during the manufacture of pesticides and chemicals and during
smelting operations.
Consumption of food, primarily meat, dairy products and fish, makes up more
than 90 percent of the intake of dioxins for the general population,
according to the US Centers for Disease Control. Studies in France show
people there are routinely exposed to 1.2 picograms of dioxin daily. US
exposure is similar.
Medical tests are available to measure dioxin levels in body fat, blood and
breast milk, but the tests are not routinely available. They are expensive
and require special expertise. Animal studies and epidemiological studies
continue to implicate dioxin in cancer, reproductive and developmental
disorders and nervous system problems.
And these studies have been persuasive enough for the WHO to designate
dioxin a Class 1 carcinogen - a known cancer-causing compound. But
long-term effects in humans have not been directly established, which has
left room for debate on the exact level of risk posed by the chemical.
In the most severe incident, the chemical plant explosion near Seveso,
Italy, exposed thousands of people to a smoky cloud containing dioxin.
In that disaster, there were immediate human health effects - nearly 450
people developed chloracne, a disfiguring skin disease. [A different dose
and exposure route to produce immediate effects.
But the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, which has
been following this group of people, says no unusual further incidence of
disease has turned up over the past 2 decades.
Still, governments have been ever more cautious about regulating dioxin.
While alert for accidents, their strategy to reduce overall dioxin exposure
is to clamp down on industrial emissions.
