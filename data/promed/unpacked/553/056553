Influenza outbreak in an Aged Care Facility, Australian Capital
Territory (ACT) - Update
----------------------------------------------------
Further to our ProMED-mail posting of 22 Nov 2006 archived as
"Influenza, nursing home - Australia (Canberra) (02) 20061122.3323,"
we provide the following update.
Between 11 Oct and 6 Dec 2006, 55 (42 percent) of 132 residents and
22 (12 percent) of 173 staff in a Canberra Aged Care Facility [the
Jindalee Nursing home] reported onset of symptoms including cough,
fever and runny nose. Of these, 18 (32.7 percent) of affected
residents and 1 (4.5 percent) affected staff member have had
laboratory-confirmed Influenza A infection. Laboratory confirmation
of Influenza A required either a PCR positive result, and/or a
positive immuno-fluorescence (IF) result on a nose or throat swab,
and/or a 4-fold rise in convalescent sera or a single titre of 64 or
more specific for Influenza A. In one instance, a rapid antigen test
was considered confirmatory despite a negative IF due to subsequent
specimen quality issues.
Thirty-five of 55 (65 percent) affected residents and 10 (45 percent)
of 22 affected staff were appropriately immunised with the 2006/2007
influenza vaccine prior to the outbreak. Six (17 percent) of 35
vaccinated residents and 2 (20 percent) of the 10 vaccinated staff
were subsequently laboratory confirmed with Influenza A.
Nine residents and no staff have died during the outbreak
period. The mean age at death is 88 years, median 91 (range 75 to
100 years). Two residents who died were fully vaccinated for
influenza with the 2006/2007 vaccine.
Vaccination clinics for staff and residents, enhanced infection
control including exclusion of unvaccinated staff and visitors,
isolation of cases, restricting resident transfers and admissions,
cancellation of group activities and restrictions for staff on
working in other nursing homes were key features of the outbreak
control strategy.
Oseltamivir prophylaxis was provided to asymptomatic staff and
recommended to residents' medical practitioners. Treatment doses
were prescribed for those who had respiratory symptoms. Oseltamivir
for staff was provided by the ACT Health Protection Service on a cost
recovery basis from the ACT Oseltamivir stockpile.
At time of the outbreak, at least 77 percent of the 31 164 adults
aged over 65 years in the ACT were appropriately immunised in the ACT.
HA PCR was performed on outbreak specimens by the Institute of
Clinical Pathology & Medical research in Sydney. The haemagglutinin
in region 1 (535 base pairs) was sequenced. Homology of 99 percent
with influenza A/New York/3/2006 (H3N2) and influenza A/Western
Australia/76/2005 was determined using the Basic Logical Alignment
Search Tool (BLAST).
Nucleoprotein PCR was performed and the PCR amplicon sequenced (250
base pairs). BLAST search revealed 99 percent homology with
influenza A/New York/3/2006 (H3N2) which is covered in the current vaccine.

[ProMED-mail appreciates this comprehensive account of the
investigation of the outbreak of illness at the Jindalee Nursing
home, Canberra, by the ACT Acute Response Team; a model for others to
follow. The data illustrate the relatively greater vulnerability of
the very elderly to influenza A virus infection, even when
appropriately vaccinated. - Mod.CP]
