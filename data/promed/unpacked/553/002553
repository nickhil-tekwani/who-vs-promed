Cholera kills one, 100-plus in hospital in Volga city
---------------------------------
KAZAN, 31 Jul 2001 (Itar-Tass via COMTEX) -- An outbreak of cholera in
the Volga river city of Kazan in the Russian republic of Tatarstan has
killed a 40-year-old man after he swam in a dirty reservoir there. By
Tuesday 33 cases of infection had been registered, including 19
children under 14 years of age. All those ill, and another 100
suspected of catching the disease, are in hospital.
On rounds of houses and apartments contacting 63 000 residents,
medical staff have identified 210 people who have been in touch with
those infected. The Tatarstan cabinet of ministers has held an
emergency session to approve measures to localise and beat the
outbreak. A total of 7 temporary hospitals with 595 beds have opened
under quarantine measures and police guard at a sanatorium and a
school.
Kazan Mayor Kamil Iskhakov has declared 3 districts zones of increased
danger. Extra measures have been taken to improve cleaning of yards
and entrance halls to apartment houses and to clear rubbish. All city
reservoirs are under restrictions.
