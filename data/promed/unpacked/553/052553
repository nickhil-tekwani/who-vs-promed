Sylvatic rabies took a new victim yesterday [17 Feb 2011]. A girl, 4
years of age, member of the indigenous community of San Ramon in Bagua
province, become the 7th person to die due to the epidemic unleashed
from the bite of hematophagous [blood feeding] bats that have been
attacking for some weeks in this area of the country.

This information was confirmed by the Regional Health Director, Cesar
Velasquez Vilchez, who told Peru 21 [news outlet] that the child had
been attended to in the Chiriaco Health Center, but was taken away
from this place voluntarily by her parents because they decided to
take her to a traditional folk healer to attend to her illness.

"The traditions of the native communities are well entrenched, so that
we could not convince the family to leave her under medical attention,
and the child died when she was taken by river in a small [boat]," he
said. The specialist added that the residents of that place refuse to
permit health officials to come close to their dead and because of
this they could not take samples necessary to determine [the cause] of
the disease.

Nonetheless, he mentioned that this year [2011] some 1200 people have
been bitten by these [vampire] bats that inhabit the caves and the
canopies of the tall trees [not canopies, they roost in hollows in the
trunks. - Mod.TY] of Imaza and Condorcanqui provinces. Most [people
bitten] are children less than 15 years of age, so that vaccination of
the population has been initiated.
"Given the number of people bitten, we have initiated a vaccination
campaign, and now there are 400 people protected during the 1st 7 days
of of work. We hope to immunize another 1200 or 1800 people in 6
native communities that are most affected by the bats," he said.

Velasquez stated that the only way to combat rabies is to prevent
disease. Because of this, he noted, that with help from experts from
Lima, campaigns were also to be launched to educate the populace and
every health agent, from physicians to drivers, about the way to avoid
vampire bat bites.

[Curiously, no mention of vampire bat-transmitted rabies in livestock,
especially cattle and horses. Apparently, there are no plans to
initiate vampire bat control activities as have been successfully
carried out in Mexico. These bats can be captured in mist nets at
night, and warfarin (Coumadin) -- and related anticoagulants -- can be
applied in jelly. The treated bats return to their communal roosts,
groom themselves and others groom them as well, ingesting the
anticoagulant and die. Oral administration of anticoagulants to
cattle, in doses that do not adversely affect the cattle, can attain
blood levels sufficient to kill vampire bats.

Of the 3 species of vampire bats in South America, the most common is
_Desmodus rotundus_, which is most likely responsible for the rabies
virus transmission in these cases. An image can be accessed at
