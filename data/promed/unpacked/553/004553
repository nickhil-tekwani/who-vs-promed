Animal Health Care Flanders [DGZ Vlaanderen] has linked more abortions in cattle to an infection with the Schmallenberg virus [SBV] during the first half of 2021. That is what the organization says in its 'Veescoop herkauwers' ['Veescoop ruminants'] periodical that the organization recently published [see commentary].

In addition to pathological examinations and the obligatory brucellosis examinations, various other tests are carried out on fetuses and afterbirths that DGZ Vlaanderen receives within the framework of the abortion protocol, in order to determine the cause of the abortion.

Compared to the same period in 2020, significantly more PCR-positive cases for Schmallenberg virus were found in the abortion cases submitted in the spring of 2021. The share of positive tests was 21% in 2021 compared to 16% in 2020, of the total number of abortions examined for the Schmallenberg virus.

[ProMED-mail thanks Mahmoud Orabi for this submission.

The periodical 'Veescoop ruminants' No 007, recently published by DGZ, covered the period Jan-June 2021. It includes, in addition to the above report, the following information (in Dutch, translated, available at https://www.dgz.be/media/1s4bl0b2/veescoop_herkauwers_nr_007_1e_semester_2021.pdf):

"From past experience and from the literature we know that the SBV causes, in fetuses of pregnant animals -- depending on the stage of their pregnancy at the time of infection -- various congenital abnormalities, such as blindness, brain, and limb changes/lesions (such as crooked legs or arthrogryposis). An increase of arthrogryposis cases was recorded during the recent spring: 4.1% of submitted aborted calves showed arthrogryposis changes, compared to only 1.6% during the same period in 2020. Of these 4.1% cases of arthropryposis, more than 37% were confirmed as positive for SBV by PCR or by the antibody analysis of the thoracic fluid of the fetus.

"Based on this data, we can assume that the circulation of SBV during the summer and fall of 2020 was increased within a population of which immunity against this virus had declined to an extent enabling the virus to cause the abnormalities during early pregnancy.

"We know that SBV can also infect small ruminants. However, due to the small number of submitted foeti of small ruminants, no similar trend could be confirmed in these animals".

For a comprehensive review of SBV and related viruses, please refer to Ref 1.
