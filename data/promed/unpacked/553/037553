Rare Disease Rocks Village
--------------------------
An outbreak of an unidentified disease is threatening the lives of more than
200 people at Eldas area in Wajir West. Local medical boss Muktar Sheikh
Omar told the District Executive Committee yesterday that health experts
would visit the area next week to study the outbreak.
Local health staff suspected that the disease was caused by severe
malnutrition. [I presume that they mean worsened by severe malnutrition. -
Mod.ES] He, however, said the local district hospital had no laboratory
facilities to analyse specimens from victims.
The medial boss said that Save the Children, a foreign Non-Governmental
Organisation, had pledged to set up a feeding centre for malnourished
children.
Lack of drugs in the local hospital had worsened the outbreak.
