[It is now 20 days since the last report of a locally transmitted case in Wuhan -- 6 days more than 1 incubation period (an outbreak is usually declared over/transmission declared interrupted after 2 incubation periods without newly confirmed cases). In today's (23 Apr 2020) report, there are 4 new reports of locally transmitted infection, 3 in Heilongjiang and 1 in Guangdong, and 2 newly confirmed imported cases bringing the total of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours to 6. It has now been 30 days since restrictions were lifted in Guangdong and Heilongjiang, and it appears as though local transmission has been established in both Heilongjiang and Guangdong over the past 19 days or so, albeit the number of reported cases from Guangdong is decreasing.

According to the report above, a total of 82 804 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4632 deaths, representing an increase of 6 cases mentioned above, in the 24 hours since yesterday's (22 Apr 2020) report, and there were no newly reported deaths. 2 new cases were reported from Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases continue to be reported daily but are decreasing. And Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases.

As best as I can decipher from the machine-translated report above, there were 34 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, 1 in an imported case. There was 3 conversions from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 979, and 157 of these are importations from abroad. It would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly. It is apparent that there is most likely thorough contact tracing and testing to explain the daily reports of asymptomatic infections in addition to screening of individuals arriving from overseas.

As reported, on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world is watching carefully to see whether this is safe timing. There do appear to be chains of transmission ongoing in Guangdong and Heilongjiang that are of concern, but clearly the most concerning are the imported cases returning to China.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 189 973 cases, including 25 549 deaths, up from 183 957 cases and 24 648 deaths reported on 22 Apr 2020. The 24-hour change between 22 and 23 Apr 2020 was 2646 newly confirmed cases, compared with 2729 newly confirmed cases between 21 Apr 2020 and 22 Apr 2020 -- a slow vacillating but steady decline. Numbers of hospitalized cases and numbers of cases in the ICU are also experiencing a decline. Cases continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 72.0% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the main contributor representing 40.6% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Other provinces with more than 100 newly confirmed cases include Liguria to the north (5.0% of newly reported cases) and Apulia on the heel of the boot with 4.1% of newly reported cases. 6 provinces reported less than 10 newly confirmed cases and another 4 provinces reported less than 50 newly confirmed cases. All signs of decreasing local transmission. There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 38 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 36 days since the countrywide lockdown. The lockdown is being extended until 3 May 2020 (see ProMED-mail post 20200411.7211958 for details).

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 880 204 including 49 845 deaths, an increase from 848 994 cases and 47 676 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York state, with 268 581 (30.5%) cumulative case reports and 6313 (20.2%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing. New York City had a cumulative total of 141 754 as of 1:00 PM on 23 Apr 2020, including 10 290 confirmed deaths and an additional 5121 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

Daily reported case counts are high in New Jersey (4160 -- 13.3% of total), Massachusetts (3079 -- 9.9%), Illinois (1826 -- 5.9%), and California (1686 -- 5.4%). In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, Massachusetts, California, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Michigan, Florida, Louisiana, and Connecticut.

The US Military has confirmed 5901 cumulative cases, with 167 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. There have been 977 cases reported from federal prisons (an increase of 69 cases in the past 24 hours), and 1321 cases reported from the Navajo Nation (unchanged in the past 48 hours). Puerto Rico has reported 1416 cases (an increase of 38 cases in the past 24 hours).

[Spain is 2nd globally in terms of the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. There were 4635 newly confirmed cases reported today (23 Apr 2020) and 4211 cases reported yesterday (22 Apr 2020). While the daily newly confirmed cases continue in the 4000-5000 range, the 14-day population-based rate is gradually decreasing as is the daily number of deaths.

As of today (23 Apr 2020), totals of 213 024 cases and 22 157 deaths have been reported, up from 208 389 cases and 21 717 deaths in the preceding 24 hours (22 Apr 2020). The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is now 128.82, a continual slow decrease over the past 14 days from a high of 214.43 on 7 Apr 2020 to 128.82 today (23 Apr 2020). Spain has the highest case count in Europe and is 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 213 024 cases, approximately 78 089 (36.7% have been hospitalized and 8226 (3.9%) admitted to the ICU (there is a note mentioning that some of the communities are providing daily prevalence data, hence my use of "approximately" for hospitalization and ICU data).

A map of Spain showing provinces (autonomous communities) can be seen at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/spain-administrative-map.htm and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7262187,43. La Rioja, Navarre, and Basque Country, the most affected communities by population-based rates, are located together in the north of the country. Madrid is in the northern part of central Spain, and Castile-La Mancha is just to the south of Madrid, with Toledo as its capital. - Mod.MPP]
