On Friday [13 Apr 2012], relatives of the fatal victims and a member of Carabobo House of Representatives, Mr Miguel Velasquez, appeared before the Public Prosecutor's Office to introduce a formal complaint supported by medical and laboratory records, with respect to the death of 119 newborns in Valencia Central Hospital [AKA Dr Enrique Tejera Hospital Complex].

One little girl died last Saturday [7 Apr 2012]. Her grandmother reported she had written confirmation that the 7-month, pre-term baby was infected with _Serratia marcescens_, which led to cardio-respiratory arrest and eventual death.

Another mother was admitted to Valencia Central Hospital at week 40 of pregnancy. Her baby boy, who had a congenital cardiopathy, died in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of the bacterial infection.

Another woman declared that her baby was infected with _Klebsiella pneumoniae_. She showed the report from the microbiology laboratory. The baby died 8 days ago.

Relatives of the deceased children expect that investigations will be carried out as fast as possible. They say that this complaint will never bring their babies back to life, but it may prevent the occurrence of similar cases in the future.

Last weekend [31 Mar-1 Apr 2012], 3 neonates died in Dr Jorge Lizarraga Children's Hospital of the Dr Enrique Tejera Hospital Complex, presumably because of the dissemination of the microorganism _Serratia marcescens_.

One father attributed his child's death to medical negligence, since on night shifts there is no medical personnel taking care of newborn babies. The problem arises when shifts change. He declared that even though newborn children need special care on a 24/7 basis, mothers are the ones who realize their babies have fever. "Here we have more dead children than at times of war. They should not admit more pregnant women."

Parents of newborn children hospitalized in Dr Jorge Lizarraga Children's Hospital declared that poor and/or lack of adequate care practices are one of the main reasons for contamination.

A mother of one of the newborn babies declared that during her 2-month hospitalization more than 50 newborns had died. She counted 10 deceased children in a 4-day period. She attributed this to the fact that both healthy and infected children are placed in the same area and they sometimes even share beds. "2 or 3 babies die every day, people complain but there's never an adequate response. Nobody is able to face the situation. They just call you on the phone to tell you that your child died, and that's all."

According to relatives of children, the use of gowns, gloves, and caps has increased in the past few days. "In the recent past, some healthcare staff did not use these products."

Another mother of a hospitalized newborn baby pointed out that in addition to having to purchase every item needed for the babies' care, they are mistreated by nursing personnel. She also added that children die in the very early morning hours because during the night they do not receive adequate care. "On night shifts there are 4 nurses, 2 for hospitalized patients and 2 for extramural care. There is no physician doing a night shift."

Personnel working in the Sur de Valencia Maternity Hospital declared that _Serratia marcescens_, whose presence was recently reported at the Dr Enrique Tejera Hospital Complex, is also presumably present in their hospital. According to workers from the neonatology ward, who asked to remain anonymous because they fear retaliation, one person of the neonatology ward staff is in a delicate condition, presumably because of being infected with the aforementioned microorganism since last year [2011]. "The Safety Committee of Sur de Valencia Maternity Hospital has not done anything. This case was also reported to the National Prevention, Health and Labor Safety Institute." However, it is not known whether children had died in this healthcare facility, since after being born, children are transferred to other hospitals.

[The 2 news reports above describe ongoing, concurrent outbreaks of _Serratia marcescens_ infection in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) at 2 different hospitals in Valencia, Venezuela, -- Valencia Central Hospital [AKA Dr Jorge Lizarraga Children's Hospital of the Dr. Enrique Tejera Hospital Complex] and Sur de Valencia Maternity Hospital. Possibly another concurrent NICU outbreak due of _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ is also occurring at Dr Jorge Lizarraga Children's Hospital. The outbreak is reported to have resulted in 119 deaths at one of these hospitals and involved preterm neonates, as well as neonates with birth defects. We are told that a worker from the neonatology ward of one of the hospitals may have been allowed to continue working for many months despite being infected with one of these organisms.

Inadequate infection control procedures and staffing at these hospitals are described. However, we are not told of the total number of neonates infected, the exact timeline of the outbreak, the types of infections encountered, medical conditions of the infected neonates that might have predisposed to infections, any associations with particular medical or surgical procedures, if facilities other than the NICUs are involved, if environmental sampling for contamination with these organisms was done, if genotyping was done to see if one or more outbreak strains are involved, etc. More information is obviously needed. The results of the epidemiologic investigation would be greatly appreciated.

_S. marcescens_ and _K. pneumoniae_ are Gram negative, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped bacteria of the _Enterobacteriaceae_ family that have been reported to cause NICU outbreaks (1-7). _S. marcescens_ is a common environmental contaminant. A focal source in one of these NICU outbreaks involved contaminated liquid soap used for handwashing (7). Colonized or infected patients and contaminated environmental surfaces represent important reservoirs for these organisms. Transmission through carriage on the hands of healthcare personnel is an important route in many of these outbreaks. Barrier precautions (contact isolation/cohorting of colonized and infected patients, the use of gloves and gowns), in addition to strictly performed hand disinfection, rigorous environmental cleaning and disinfection of medical equipment and wards, and use of single-patient medical instruments will likely be crucial for containment of the outbreak.
