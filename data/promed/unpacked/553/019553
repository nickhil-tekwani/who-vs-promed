A cluster of genetically-linked _E. coli_ infections has sickened 4 Humboldt County residents since July 2013, county health officials said one Wed 6 Nov 2013.

"What's unusual about the current cases is not the number of them but their connection to each other," county Department of Health and Human Services Public Information Manager Heather Muller said. According to DHHS, an _E. coli_ case was reported in July 2013, but it wasn't considered unusual. A new case in the middle of August 2013 was also viewed as an ordinary occurrence. When 2 more cases surfaced in October 2013, routine lab tests sent to the state Department of Public Health revealed all 4 cases came from a strain of _E. coli_ known as 0157:H7.

"It would be like if you had 10 burglaries in a neighborhood, and you fingerprinted all of them, and 4 of them came back as the same fingerprint; you'd know that 4 of the cases were by the same robber," DHHS nurse Eric Gordon said in a release. He said this [specific O157] strain had not been seen in California before.

These infections are typically caused by contaminated food. Health officials have not been able to track down the source of the bacteria, but all 4 patients have been asked what and where they ate before they became sick. DHHS media spokeswoman Heather Shelton said all 4 are at least 50 years old and live between Southern Humboldt and northern Humboldt Bay. One was local a supervisor who was released from the hospital on Tue 5 Nov 2013 after several weeks of care. Shelton said 2 other _E. coli_ O157 infections reported in February and September of 2013 are not related.

Three of the Humboldt County cases progressed to hemolytic uremic syndrome, or HUS, a serious complication of this _E. coli_ infection, characterized by acute kidney failure and anemia caused by the destruction of red blood cells.

According to the CDC, there are about 265 000 of these _E. coli_ cases each year in the USA, with around 36 percent caused by the 0157:H7 strain.

[Most cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome occur in young children rather than in adults. Since this complication occurs generally in only 5-10 percent of cases, it is probable that cases occurred and were not recognized. ProMED awaits more information regarding the cases and possible vehicle. Since the cases were spread out over a period of months, either the vehicle contamination was continuing or the product was one that could be frozen. That all the cases were in adults suggests that the vehicle is something less likely to be eaten by children. - Mod.LL
