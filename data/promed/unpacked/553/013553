Wild Green-winged Teal ducks in central Illinois have tested positive
for a low-pathogenic strain of avian influenza, the government said on Friday.
"Initial tests confirm that these wild duck samples do not contain
the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain that has spread through birds in
Asia, Europe and Africa," the Agriculture and Interior departments
said in a statement.
Five of 11 samples taken from the ducks tested positive for the H5
virus subtype and one contained the H5 and N1 subtypes, they said.
The samples were sent to a federal laboratory [National Veterinary
Services Laboratory, NVSL] in Ames, Iowa, for further testing of virus strains.
The samples were collected on Sunday at the Rice Lake Conservation
area in Fulton County, central Illinois. The ducks showed no signs of
illness, which also indicates a low-risk strain of avian influenza.
As a precaution against the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus that has
killed millions of fowl, the government has stepped up testing of
wild birds. The Agriculture and Interior departments say they expect
to find additional cases of common strains of avian influenza that
pose no risk to humans.

Tests have found suspected bird flu in wild, migratory ducks in
Illinois, but federal officials said Friday it's not likely to be the
deadly Asian subtype they fear could reach North America.
Initial test results suggest the ducks had a strain of virus that
poses no threat to human health, officials from the U.S. Department
of Agriculture and Department of the Interior said.
The ducks showed no sign of being sick, which also suggests a common
strain of bird influenza. Results from further testing are expected
within several weeks and will be made public, officials said.
Other states have also had wild birds test positive recently for the
low-grade strain of bird flu, including Pennsylvania, Maryland and Michigan.
The samples from green-winged teals were collected on 24 Sep 2006 in
the Rice Lake Conservation Area of Fulton County in west central
Illinois. The USDA and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources
are cooperating to sample and test wild birds for the virus in a
stepped-up monitoring program.
There is no known health risk to hunters or hunting dogs from the
wild birds with the low-grade bird flu. Officials said hunters should
always wash their hands when handling wildlife and cook foods thoroughly.
No birds in North America have tested positive for the Asian subtype
of the bird flu virus known as H5N1, which has killed at least 148
people. The greatest number of deaths has been in Indonesia,
according to the World Health Organization.
Wherever the disease has spread to humans, it has been through
people's direct contact with the birds, mostly in Asia involving
poultry. Experts fear the virus could mutate into a form that could
be easily transmitted among humans, causing a worldwide pandemic that
could kill millions of people.

[There is often a low-pathogenic strain of avian influenza that seems
to circulate in wild birds, without causing any problems. What is
noteworthy is that these several posts indicate that surveillance is
working. - Mod.TG]
