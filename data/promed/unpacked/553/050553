Tests show 7 more infected cows in Wyoming herd
-----------------------------------------------
Wyoming's state veterinarian, Walt Cook, says 7 more cows have tested
positive for brucellosis in a western Wyoming cattle herd infected
with the livestock disease.

Today's [24 Jul 2008] results bring the total number of
brucellosis-infected cattle in the herd to 36. So far, the 650-head
herd near Daniel is the only herd in Wyoming to test positive for the
bacterial infection.

Wyoming and federal livestock officials are testing 14 other cattle
herds that had contact with the infected herd. Of the 2 contact herds
tested so far, both turned up negative.

The state will lose its federal brucellosis-free status if another
herd tests positive for brucellosis within 2 years.

[These animals may have been associated with some of the residual
brucellosis that seems to plague the greater Yellowstone area (GYA).
Many plans have been made and examined for methods of dealing with
the disease and the animals affected. One of the latest is a split
state status, carving out the GYA as an affected area while the rest
of the state maintains its free-state status. - Mod.TG
