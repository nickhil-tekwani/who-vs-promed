An alarmingly high rate of transgender women in major US cities have tested positive for HIV, according to a government study. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) compiled data from a study between late 2019 and early 2020, from a sample of 1608 trans women living in Atlanta, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Seattle. Among all participants, 42% of trans women reported being HIV-positive.

Rates were even higher for Black and Native American/Alaskan Native women: 62% of Black women and 65% of Native trans women reporting living with HIV. For Latina trans women, 35% reported living with HIV, compared with 20% for Asian women and 17% for white women.

Dr. Demetre Daskalis, director of the CDC's Division of HIV/AIDS prevent, told The 19th that the study provides "a clear and compelling picture of the severe toll of HIV among transgender women and the social and economic factors -- including systemic racism and transphobia -- that are contributing to this unacceptable burden."

According to The 19th, the data may not accurately reflect trans women across the country, or even in major cities, because researchers solely examined areas and populations at a greater risk of HIV. A previous study pointed to lower rates of HIV, around 14%, among transgender women of all racial groups.

Ilan Meyer, distinguished senior scholar of public policy at the UCLA-affiliated Williams Institute, told The 19th that the "numbers are definitely alarming and call for renewed efforts to distribute [HIV prevention medication] and other preventive strategies among transgender women of color." However, Meyer noted that the CDC report is a step in the right direction given its sole focus on trans woman, as prior surveys placed trans women with gay and bisexual men, or neglected to include them.

About 42% of transgender women tested positive for HIV as of early 2020, per a new government study run across 7 major US cities, and Black women have been particularly impacted. The staggering figure is one of the few snapshots into the unequal toll the virus continues to exert.

Among Black trans women, 62% tested positive for HIV, according to the report, which was collected and analyzed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). About 35% of Latinas reported the same. But among White trans women, 17% tested positive -- still far higher than the general US population, but lower than any other racial group. Among American Indian/Alaska Native women who were tested, 65% were HIV-positive, as were 20% of Asian women. Both groups came from particularly small sample sizes, however: American Indian/Alaska Native women made up 1% of all the people studied, and Asian women made up 2%.

The data comes from HIV surveillance testing conducted between 2019 and early 2020 in Atlanta, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York City, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Seattle. The paper looked at 1608 women across those cities and was conducted in an effort to better understand how HIV affects trans women in particular.

The dataset involved, which was collected through the CDC's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance program, looks specifically at populations and areas with elevated HIV risk. That means the findings may not reflect HIV prevalence among transgender women of color generally, said Ilan Meyer, a distinguished senior scholar of public policy at the UCLA-affiliated Williams Institute. And other analyses, including a 2018 meta-analysis, suggested lower HIV rates -- closer to 14% -- among transgender women of all races [https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2018.304727].

Still, Meyer said, "These numbers are definitely alarming and call for renewed efforts to distribute [HIV prevention medication] and other preventive strategies among transgender women of color." Historically, there has been little national data probing racial and geographic disparities among transgender women. The new CDC report offers a 1st step in that direction, though advocates and experts note that it's still only a 1st step toward addressing the disparities. "A lot more efforts are needed to study representative samples of transgender populations to give us better population-wide estimates," Meyer said.

HIV rates varied among cities. In Atlanta, 58% tested were HIV-positive. In New York City, 52% tested positive; 51% did so in Philadelphia and 45% in New Orleans. In San Francisco, 41% of surveyed women had a positive HIV test compared with 33% in Los Angeles and 21% in Seattle.

"These data provide a clear and compelling picture of the severe toll of HIV among transgender women and the social and economic factors -- including systemic racism and transphobia -- that are contributing to this unacceptable burden," said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, director of CDC's Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, in a statement.

The data -- collected before the COVID-19 crisis -- takes on even greater significance now, as experts worry a potential 4th wave of the virus could emerge. Untreated HIV weakens the immune system and is a risk factor for COVID-19 complications.

In the United States at large, about 1.2 million people are living with HIV, per government statistics. It has long been clear that -- when it comes to the dual burden of both contracting the virus and facing barriers to treatment -- Black people, transgender people, and gay and bisexual men are at greatest risk. People who live in the South are particularly vulnerable, per CDC analyses.

The disparities, experts believe, stem from overlapping layers of discrimination against transgender people, and particularly transgender people of color. That includes employment discrimination, higher rates of poverty, and increased barriers to both health insurance and competent medical care. "It's income, it's violence, it's education. All the social determinants of health that affect everyone else -- it's intensified when you add in the element of trans women not being accepted in certain spaces," said Coleman Goode, a community organizer at the AIDS Foundation Chicago. "There's so much that plays into the higher rates of HIV among trans women of color."

The economic gaps have only grown in the past year. Early data suggest that transgender people were more likely to have suffered because of the pandemic-induced recession. Transgender people of color were at particularly high risk: 26% had lost work as of last summer [2020], per research published by the Human Rights Campaign. All that makes it harder to access the HIV prevention pill (known as PrEP), which is at least 90% effective and recommended for daily use in people who are at greater risk of HIV exposure. Without health insurance, the pill can cost close to USD 2000 a month.

Beyond finances, there are other concerns. The CDC report found that while 92% of HIV-negative women knew about PrEP, barely one-third -- 32% -- were taking the pill. Many cited worries about how the pill might interact with hormones, along with mistrust of the healthcare system due to experiences with transphobia and lack of trans-inclusive marketing surrounding the HIV prevention pill. "A lot of people considered it a white male gay drug," Goode said. "Among white gay men, their numbers have been dropping dramatically. But the numbers in black communities are going up -- they're the highest they've been. And there were doctors that didn't want to prescribe it, because they felt like it's a gay or white thing, or you don't need that."

Commentary
----------
"Lowering the number of new HIV infections among transgender women is a major HIV prevention goal [1]. This goal can be achieved by implementing 3 important strategies for reducing HIV infections:

(1) intensifying HIV prevention efforts in populations where HIV is most heavily concentrated, including transgender women; gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (hereafter referred to as MSM); black or African American persons; Hispanic or Latino persons; and persons who inject drugs (PWID);
(2) expanding efforts to prevent HIV infection by using a combination of effective, evidence-based, scalable approaches (including preexposure prophylaxis [PrEP]) tailored specifically for populations at risk; and
(3) educating the general public about the threat of HIV infection and how to prevent it, which can help address HIV stigma [1-3]. State and local health departments, as well as federal agencies, are expected to monitor progress toward HIV prevention goals [1].

"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) serves as a key component of a high-impact prevention approach to reducing the spread of HIV in the United States [4]. NHBS provides data for monitoring behaviors among populations disproportionately burdened by HIV infection and for identifying the populations for whom scientifically proven, cost- effective, and scalable interventions are most appropriate. Monitoring key indicators among members of key populations is critical to achieving the goals of the Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America initiative [5]. This initiative is aimed at reducing new HIV infections by 90% by 2030 by implementing evidence-based strategies for specific populations in geographic areas most affected by HIV. NHBS has previously proven effective at monitoring key indicators, such as sexual and drug use behaviors; HIV testing and linkage to care; access to, and use of, prevention interventions, including PrEP and syringe services programs (SSP); and prevalence of HIV and other infections in areas with high HIV prevalence among 3 populations at high risk of HIV infection: MSM, PWID, and heterosexually active persons at increased risk for HIV infection [6,7]. Transgender women are reported to be disproportionately affected by HIV infection; however, little is known about the epidemiology of HIV infection among this population in the United States [8]. To address this gap in data, CDC sought to implement National HIV Behavioral Surveillance among Transgender Women (NHBS-Trans).

"This report summarizes findings from the 1st NHBS-Trans data collection cycle, which was conducted in 2019-2020. Transgender women, especially transgender women of color, are disproportionately affected by HIV [8]. This report provides descriptive, unweighted data that can be used to describe HIV infection among transgender women and the percentages of transgender women reporting specific behaviors, HIV testing, access to care, participation in prevention programs, gender-affirming medical treatment, experiences of abuse and harassment, and suicidality. Collecting these data is useful for assessing risk, access to care and treatment, the use of prevention efforts, and other social structural factors affecting HIV prevention opportunities for this population."
