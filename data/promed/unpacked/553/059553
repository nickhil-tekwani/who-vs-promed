[The possible role of wild birds in the maintenance and dissemination of HPAI H5N1 virus has been subject to lively discussions in past postings, especially in relation to China, Mongolia and eastern Russia, including Siberia.

The Altai Republic is at the very centre of Asia at the junction of the Siberian taiga, steppes of Kazakhstan, and semi-deserts of Mongolia, bordering Mongolia (SE), China (S), Kazakhstan (S/SW), and Russian Siberia (Kemerovo, Khakassia, and Tuva) on the north. See administrative map of Russia at http://www.eegas.com/images/11-legend.gif.

The Altay region (Kray) was reportedly infected during the years 2005/6. - Mods.AS/CRD
