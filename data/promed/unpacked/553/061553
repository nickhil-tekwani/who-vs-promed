Infection by anikasis simplex by eating raw fish is commonly known. But now
evidence of allergic reactions to well - cooked but infected fish is
emerging. (New Scientist-15 march 1997 p.7;- The Veterinary Record ,1 march
1997)

[The full reference for the Veterinary Record paper is: L. Audicana et al,
1997, Cooking and freezing may not protect against allergic reactions in
ingested _Anisakis simplex_ antigens in humans, Vet Rec 140:235. A short
review paper that is worth reading. They refer to multiple cases in northern
Spain both from handling and from eating cooked and frozen infected fish. MHJ]
