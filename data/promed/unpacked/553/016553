The following information is a copy of Australia's latest advice to the
Office International des Epizooties on avian influenza in New South Wales:
Update on incursion of highly pathogenic avian influenza in New South
Wales, Australia.
Further to my previous advice of 1 December, I wish to advise that further
laboratory studies have indicated that the isolated virus has an
Intravenous Pathogenicity Index (IVPI) of 2.54. Studies of the
haemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) antigens have
subtyped the virus as H7N4.
[An additional farm within the surveillance zone has been depopulated,
based upon confirmation of the disease at an early stage after infection.
An update of relevant details is presented at Attachment 1.

Attachment 1
Country/Location: Australia, Tamworth in the state of New South Wales.
Date of Notification: 1 December 1997, updated 9 December 1997
Name of Disease: Avian Influenza
Nature of Diagnosis: Fluorescent antibody testing of impression smears of
pancreas and isolation of an influenza virus in inoculated embryonated
eggs. The virus has been typed as H7N4.
Date of initial detection: 25 November 1997
Estimated Date of first infection: Unknown
Number of separate outbreaks: Two
Geographical identification: 31o 1' south, 150o 50' east, near Tamworth,
NSW about 400 km north of Sydney.
Details concerning the outbreak:
Serial No. Species No. of animals
1 avian 128,000
2 avian 30,000

Comments concerning affected population:
The second affected property is a farm of about 30,000 hens producing
fertile eggs for meat chickens. Eggs from this property have been
delivered to a second hatchery near Sydney. All eggs laid during the
critical period prior to diagnosis on this property have been destroyed.

Comments on the epidemiology:
The second farm is located about 3km from the first infected property. The
source of infection has not been confirmed, but is presumed to be due to
mechanical transfer from the first case via a truck used to collect and
dispose of dead birds.
Because of its proximity to the first case this property was subject to
close surveillance. Infection was confirmed following investigation of a
slight increase in mortality in one shed (2 per day to 22 per day). Early
diagnosis has allowed destruction and disposal of birds on this property
before significant levels of disease have developed.

Control measures taken to date:
The second infected property was placed in quarantine on 3 December 1997.

The restricted zone has been extended to include 3km around the second case.

The surveillance zone has been extended to include 10km around the second
case.

All birds have been destroyed on both infected properties.

Disinfection is well underway on the first property and has commenced on
the second property.

Hatching eggs considered to be an epidemiological risk from the second
property have been destroyed.

A high level of surveillance is being maintained on all poultry enterprises
within the restricted and surveillance zones.
