Human threat from sparrow-killing disease
-----------------------------------------
There is mounting concern about whether humans have caught a strain of
salmonella discovered in Tasmania's sparrows.

An investigation by veterinarians, pathologists and the University of
Tasmania's School of Medicine has found bacteria are the likely cause
of the deaths of large numbers of sparrows in recent months. Bird
watcher Sylvia McClay was one of the first to report the decline in
the state's sparrow population. "By about July/August [2009] the
numbers were about half," she said.

Veterinarian Dr David Obendorf headed an investigation into the
deaths. He found many of the dead sparrows were carrying a form of
salmonella. [Fowl typhoid is normally caused by the bacterial agent
_Salmonella gallinarum_. - Mod.TG]

"The thing is that it's also transmitted in their droppings, and that
can be a source of contamination for people because those little birds
even though they're introduced, they tend to socialize around where
people tend to congregate," he said. "In some cases it's caused human
infections in some places overseas."

Tasmania's acting director of Public Health says it's unlikely the
sparrow disease will cause typhoid in humans. [Typhoid in humans is
more accurately typhoid fever and is caused by the bacterium
_Salmonella typhi_, and is usually characterized by high fever,
gastroenteritis and severe but non-bloody diarrhea. There may be a
rash on occasion. - Mod.TG]

She says there have been 4 cases of the same salmonella strain in
humans this year [2009], and is investigating whether there is a link.
[Salmonellosis in people is generally associated with abdominal
cramps, headache, fever, and severe watery diarrhea, with sometimes
associated nausea and vomiting. - Mod.TG]

"We haven't got any evidence so far that the human cases actually
caught this from the sparrows," she said.

Dr Pickin is urging people to keep children and animals away from bird
baths, and keep water tanks covered.

"It causes what you commonly find when people talk about salmonella,
which is usually diarrhea, vomiting, headache, can occasionally cause
a fever, and in the very young and the very elderly, can be very
serious," said Dr Pickin.

[We hope that Tasmania Public Health will provide more information
regarding this situation and identify the bacteria. There are many
_Salmonella_ species, and currently this article is vague enough to be
slightly confusing since different species of salmonella cause various
diseases in birds vs those in people. - Mod.TG]
