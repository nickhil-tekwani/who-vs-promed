The most significant and concerning development during the past week is the spread of ASF into Laos, a regional country hitherto not known to be infected. The 7 foci of ASF infection in Toumlan (map at https://tinyurl.com/y4653mna) reportedly started between 2 and 8 Jun 2019. Toumlan is situated about 60 km [approx. 37 mi] westwards to the Vietnamese border, where ASF has been circulating since 19 Feb 2019.

Out of Laos's some 31 million domestic pigs (OIE's 2017 data), more than 621 000 are located in Salavan, where their density is the highest in the country (72.11/sq.km).

The FAO weekly update (item 1 above) also includes the following figures, table, and map:
- Figure 1. Number of ASF reported village by region by onset month in China (source: Veterinary Bureau, MARA, China);
- Figure 2. Newly affected communes/week and the distribution by Regional Animal Health Office (RAHO), Viet Nam;
- Table 1. List of ASF detected provinces in China within the past 2 months.
- Map 1. ASF situation in Asia, August 2018 to 20 Jun 2019 [with distinctive signs for]:
1. New outbreaks reported during 14-20 Jun 2019;
2. Outbreaks reported before 14 Jun 2019;
3. Detection in free wild boar before 14 Jun 2019;
4. Provinces with an epidemic zone now (China);
5. Cross provincial movement of pigs is limited in neighbouring provinces (China);
6. Drifted on the coast [Taiwan].

Subscribers are referred to OIE's interactive ASF map presenting all outbreaks since 19 Feb 2019, available at https://tinyurl.com/y45ptlun; click on the Laos cluster, zoom in to view the adjacent clusters in Viet Nam. As the map shows, the spread of the virus into Laos brings it nearer to Thailand's border, some 65 km [approx. 37 mi] west to Toumlan. - Mod.AS]
