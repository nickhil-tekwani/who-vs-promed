The administration of Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Trade and Public Health
Inspection Authority] for Stavropol Krai considers that the Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) situation in the region is serious. One patient
died on Tuesday [13 May 2008]. The agency reports that so far there are 9
other patients with CCHF registered this year [2008]. These patients are
from 8 regions of the Stavropol Krai. Only 3 patients were registered
during the same period last year [2007].

[Rospotrebnadzor reports 10 cases of CCHF this year (2008) coming from 8
regions of the krai (region). There were 3 reported cases during the
previous year (2007). The severity of the illness is mainly moderate to
severe. Rospotrebnadzor also states that people are beginning to seek
medical advice for tick bites more frequently. So far this year (2008), the
number of doctor visits for tick bites is 1700, which is twice as many as
during the previous year. 72 people have been admitted to hospitals with
suspected CCHF, 4 times more than last year. - Corr.BA
