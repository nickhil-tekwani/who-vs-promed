[This is a follow up report for the case that was reported on 15 May 2014 and provides additional details. - Mod.TY]

As many as 15 staff members including doctors, nurses and paramedics at a private medical facility, Maroof International Hospital, have been under observation after handling a patient who died of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) here on Saturday night [16 Apr 2015].

A 30-year-old male patient was brought to a healthcare facility in Peshawar from Afghanistan last week where he was initially treated for liver failure, but his condition continued to deteriorate, and he was referred to the Maroof International Hospital for ICU support on 7 May [2015].

At the Intensive Care Unit of MIH, the patient was put on a ventilator. His complete blood profile showed massive bleeding inside the body, and after suspecting him to be a patient of CCHF, the hospital kept him in isolation and notified the Epidemic Investigation Cell of the National Institute of Health (NIH). The patient was given antiviral treatment and immunoglobulin, but his condition became critical, and he continued to bleed inside his lungs and was drowning in his own blood, said Dr. Muhammad Haroon, an intensive care specialist serving at the MIH and Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences as a medical specialist.

Talking to The News on Wednesday [13 May 2015], he said that within 2 days after his admission to the hospital, the patient suffered complete lung, liver, and kidney shutdown, and after cardiac arrest, he expired at the MIH late Saturday [9 May 2015] night.

The patient was strongly suspected for CCHF, but he was confirmed positive for the infection 3 days after his death. Dr. Mumtaz from the EIC, NIH visited the patient and collected samples for testing for CCHF on Friday [8 May 2015]; however, the patient died on Saturday, said Dr. Haroon.

CCHF is caused by a Nairovirus of the Bunyaviridae family transmitted to humans by the bite of _Hyalomma_ ticks, mostly found on the skin of animals, including goats and sheep. CCHF is also caused by direct contact with the blood of an infected animal or human. Exposure to blood or tissue of an infected animal during or after slaughter and direct contact with blood or secretions of an infected person may also cause transmission. The case fatality rate of the deadly infection ranges from 2-50 per cent. CCHF was 1st described in Crimea in 1944 and identified in 1956 in the Congo.

Medically, a confirmed patient of CCHF is an important source of exposure for other people, particularly family members and healthcare workers. To avoid spread of the infection, the transport vehicles that carry the patient or his dead body should be disinfected by spraying a 1:10 liquid bleach solution on any surfaces touching the body, and all clothing of the deceased should be burnt.

According to experts, the dead body of a confirmed patient should be wrapped in the winding sheet (kafan) for burial. The dead body should be sprayed with a 1:10 liquid bleach solution and then placed in a plastic bag, which should be sealed with adhesive tape. In the case of death of a CCHF victim, safe burial practices must be followed.

The epidemiologist and assistant district health officer of Islamabad Capital Territory, Dr. Najeeb Durrani, when contacted by The News on Wednesday [13 May 2015], said his department was not notified of the status of the CCHF patient till Wednesday morning. He, however, said all staff members who handled the CCHF patient at the MIH are under observation, and the EIC at the NIH is closely monitoring the situation. "The animal-handling history of the patient was positive, and I have been informed by Dr. Mumtaz that the EIC had already briefed the relatives of the patient about precautionary measures to avoid the infection," said Dr. Durrani.

Dr. Haroon informed The News that one of the nurses who handled the CCHF patient at the MIH is being kept in isolation after having complaints of fever, though she did not develop any other symptom of CCHF. He said that her sample has been sent for confirmatory tests at the NIH.

[CCHF virus is endemic in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Interestingly, there was another case of CCHF infection acquired in Afghanistan who sought medical attention in Pakistan in 2014. Cases of CCHF occurred in Sindh province, Pakistan, this year (2015) and in various parts of Pakistan last year (2014).

Circumstances under which the patient acquired his CCHF virus infection are not stated in the above report. He probably acquired the infection via a tick bite or exposure to the blood of an infected animal.

The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 percent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities can occur also, which is why there is concern for the health care workers who were in contact with the above patient.

The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.

CCHF virus is a tickborne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_.
