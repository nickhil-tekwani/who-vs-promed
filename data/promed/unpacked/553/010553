[1] Cholera - Tanzania (Dar es Salaam)

At least 52 cases of cholera have been reported in parts of the
Tanzanian commercial capital, Dar es Salaam, over the last month, a
city official said on Tue, 8 Jan 2006.
"We are worried over more new cases although we have warned the
people to adhere to rules of hygiene, including boiling drinking
water, use of toilets and washing hands with soap," Gaston Makwembe,
the Dar es Salaam City Information Officer, said.
However, he said an acute shortage of water due to drought could be
one of the reasons for increased cases of cholera because people use
water from ponds and other unsafe sources.
Makwembe said, so far, none of the reported cases had been fatal. He
said those admitted to various centers were treated and discharged.

[2] Cholera - Zimbabwe

The death toll from a cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe has risen to 14,
with another dozen people in hospital in the capital showing symptoms
of the disease, the official Herald newspaper said on Mon, 9 Jan
2006. State media had reported on Fri, 6 Jan 2006, that cholera had
claimed 11 lives in the rural districts of Buhera, Chikomba and
Chivhu in the last 2 weeks and on Mon, 9 Jan 2006, the Herald said 3
more cholera deaths had been recorded in Harare.
"At least 12 people have been detained...for cholera treatment (in
Harare) ... 4 have since tested positive for cholera," the paper
said, adding that a patient from the poor township of Dzivarasekwa
was in critical condition. Health officials were not immediately
available for comment.
Last week the Herald said over 180 cholera cases had been reported in
Buhera, Chikomba and Chivhu, but that the situation was under
control. Zimbabwe has seen several outbreaks of cholera and other
diseases over the last few years, putting further strain on a health
system that has all but broken down as the country suffers an
economic crisis that has hampered importation of essential drugs and
equipment. The latest outbreak is particularly worrisome as
Zimbabwe's cities grapple with broken-down sewer systems and failure
by municipal authorities to collect refuse from residential areas,
citing a chronic shortage of fuel.

As the death toll from flooding in Mozambique over the past few days
has climbed to 22, officials are now faced with the threat of
waterborne diseases like cholera.
"About 200 cases of cholera have been reported across the country," a
spokesman for Mozambique's National Institute for Disaster Management
(INGC), Rogerio Manguele, told IRIN on Mon, 9 Jan 2006.
Heavy rain since mid-Dec 2005 has flooded the Pungue and Buzi rivers
in central Mozambique, affecting 2000 people and destroying several
thousand houses in the northeastern province of Nampula, the central
province of Sofala and Inhambane province in the south.
Access to clean drinking water has been a problem in Mozambique,
where most rural communities traditionally rely on water holes. "Most
of these [water holes] have been flooded -- we urgently require
chlorine tablets to purify water," said Fernanda Teixeiri,
secretary-general of the Mozambique Red Cross.

[4] Cholera - Rwanda (Masaka district)

The recent outbreak of Cholera in areas of Kigali City (formerly
Masaka District) had by Sat, 7 Jan 2006, claimed 17 lives. According
to the newly appointed Kigali Acting Executive Secretary Fidel
Ndayisaba, the epidemic had also led to the hospitalization of 150
people in the area.
"We are facing a serious outbreak of cholera; so far, over 150 people
have been admitted in Masaka Hospital, while 80 have already received
treatment and have been discharged. 70 are still admitted in the
hospital," Ndayisaba, who said the disease erupted in the last week
of Dec 2005, told The New Times in an exclusive interview Sat, 7 Jan
2006. He attributed the cause to the use of contaminated water from
Nyabarongo river, adding that most of the people who died had not
taken medication.
Ndayisaba, who is still catching up with the challenges in the city,
however said that Electrogaz is expediting repairs on the water pipes
to Masaka. "We have tried to supply enough clean water to the area by
the help of trucks from the City Council water, CHK [Centre
Hospitalier de Kigali], Police, army and volunteers," he said,
adding: "The trucks are used to transport and supply tap water to the
area as the pipelines are still under repair."
Early last week the official in charge of Masaka Hospital, Sister
Maria Gorreti Maama said the disease had claimed 10 lives in the
former sectors of Rusheshe and Ayabaraya in the former district of
Kabuga. She was also quoted as saying that the first case was
reported on 29 Dec 2005.

[5] Cholera, school closures - Rwanda

All primary and secondary schools in 3 sectors have been ordered not
to re-open for the new academic year due to the cholera epidemic that
has hit the area.
In Masaka sector alone, 3 primary schools, a nursery school and 2
secondary schools will not open, according to Adalbert Rukebanuka,
the area's acting Executive Secretary. The affected schools include
Ayabaraya Primary school, Rusheshe Primary School and Ecole Primaire
de Masaka and a nun-run nursery.
The secondary schools include Ecole Infirmiere de Masaka and Ecole
Technique Libre Sainte Emmanuel. The move is a directive from the
ministries of health and education to combat the cholera outbreak,
according to a source.
Rukebanuka also disclosed that local bars and market stalls selling
fresh fruits, drinks and vegetables have already been ordered to
close. However, there are fears that the area may consequently be
affected by hunger as residents fail to sell or buy agricultural produce.
Masaka sector has recorded the highest number of cholera cases. 18
have already died and over 100 people hospitalized in nearby
hospitals and dispensaries. Latest reports indicate that 6 more
people have died of cholera in the neighboring area of Bugesera.
Residents of the affected area have been advised not to drink water
from the Nyabarongo River, which is said to be contaminated. All the
affected areas border the river.

In response to the reported outbreak of diarrhea in southern Palawan,
the Department of Health and the Provincial Health Office dispatched
health teams to provide medical assistance to remedy the outbreak of diarrhea.
The teams headed by Dr. Peter Curameng of the Dept. of Health and Dr.
Antonio Palanca of the Provincial Health Office brought first aid
supplies and other medicines like antibacterials and IV fluids. The
Rural Health Units in the affected areas are already in short supply
of medicines.
As of this morning a total of 214 cases have been reported in the 22
barangays in the 3 southern towns of Palawan-Bataraza, Espanola, and
Rizal. Bataraza, with 15 barangays affected, reported the highest
number of patients at 168 as of this morning; 22 deaths. In Puerto
Princesa City, the Ospital ng Palawan, a DOH-run hospital reported 99
cases but only 15 were admitted for hospitalization.
In an interview this morning, Dr. Maridith Afuang said that 64
percent of the cases in Bataraza are amoeba-related and 30 percent
were caused by bacteria. This is based on the latest result of the
laboratory examination conducted.
