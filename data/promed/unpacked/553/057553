Illness spreads at greyhound tracks: 3 dogs at Fort Myers show signs of
disease
-----------------------------------
3 dogs at the Naples/Fort Myers Greyhound Track are showing signs of a
respiratory illness that has spread through tracks across the state, a
track official confirmed on Tuesday. While the sickness is being labeled
"kennel cough," by racing staff and the state Division of Pari-Mutuel
Wagering, the veterinary immunologist spearheading research into the
outbreak isn't sure. "That's being determined, and it's too early to know
the answer to that," said Cynda Crawford of the University of Florida,
heading a research team including veterinary virologists from Cornell
University and the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta.
Blood tests taken from recovering dogs may determine that the illness is a
variant of equine influenza virus. Crawford's team found that the virus
probably caused the death of 8 greyhounds at the Jacksonville track in
January 2004. The January outbreak was the first scientific report of the
equine virus jumping the species barrier.
Because this latest bout of illness started 3 weeks ago and the disease
takes about 4 weeks to run its course, the dogs can't be tested for flu
antibodies for at least another week. Vets also are testing for the types
of bacteria that cause the classic type of kennel cough, Crawford said. No
dogs have died in this current round of illness, in comparison, an outbreak
of kennel cough in spring 2003 was more severe, she said.
The Naples/Fort Myers Greyhound Track in Bonita Springs has been only
slightly affected, said Larry Mosher, track racing secretary. "We hardly
have it at all, if we have it." All races are set to go as scheduled but
track officials have imposed a quarantine, Mosher said.
David Roberts, director of the Division of Pari-Mutuel Wagering, said
Tuesday that he has an investigator going to the Naples/Fort Myers track
today. Roberts requested in a Monday memo that tracks statewide impose
quarantine. He said that he doesn't have the authority by law to impose one
himself. The quarantine means no greyhounds are allowed in or out.
The disease is "very fast-moving and can be transferred quickly,"
particularly when animals are in close quarters, Roberts said. "It's like
kids in a day care. One day one has a runny nose. 2 days later they all
have runny noses." This way the dogs can be isolated and treated so the
illness can run its course, Roberts said. "If everything is caught at the
proper time, it's like a very bad cold or sinus infection in humans."
Worst hit has been Tampa, which is the only track that has missed some
performances. Other tracks had some dogs scratched from racing. Roberts
said the other tracks reporting the illness include West Flagler track in
Miami; Palm Beach; Derby Lane in St. Petersburg; the Sanford/Orlando Kennel
Club; and the Washington County Kennel Club.
Mosher said that the Naples/Fort Myers track already had stopped accepting
greyhounds in as of 18 Jun 2004. The 3 greyhounds with signs of the illness
have been isolated, he said. The Naples/Fort Myers track houses about 800
dogs in 12 kennels, Mosher said. Crawford said she could not estimate
accurately the number of dogs affected statewide by this round of illness.

[Either of these diseases spreads quickly. Kennel cough is caused by
bacteria, whereas the flu is caused by a virus. Flu can cross species
lines. For example, avian flu has crossed into swine and into people. If
this should turn out to be equine flu in dogs, then it will be asked
whether this particular virus could mutate and affect other species,
including people. The outcome of Dr Crawford's research is awaited with
interest. - Mod.TG]
