FERAL CAT CONTROL (9)
====================

As from the first of next month ALL Cats in the State of Victoria Australia
have to be registered with the fee of $45 for entire cats and $14 for
desexed Cats.
At last we are on the road to responsable cat ownership, this is a major
step in the direction of saving our wildlife.
