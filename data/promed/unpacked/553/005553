Epidemiological comments: Animal movements at the borders are very
difficult to control since many animals do not show clinical signs.
Also, the laboratory tests were not carried out immediately because
the Central Veterinary Laboratory (LACEVET) did not have diagnostic
kits for the disease.

Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: The disease had
already been reported by the Veterinary Services as suspected in 2009.

Control measures - Measures applied: Stamping out; Quarantine;
Screening; Disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); No
vaccination; Treatment of affected animals (treatment before almost
all animals died: internal and external antiparasitic treatment,
supplements and antibiotics)

Measures to be applied: Control of arthropods; Control of wildlife
reservoirs; Movement control inside the country; Zoning

Laboratory name and type: Pasteur Institute of Bangui (National laboratory)
Species Swine

[It is important to note the high case fatality rate in this outbreak.
Certainly there can be many factors that play into a high case
fatality rate including host, agent and management factors. The pigs'
nutritional state may play a role as well as the type of housing.

However, one important factor maybe the host immune status vis-a-vis
the virus. African swine fever can be devastating when 1st entering
into a new susceptible population. In Cameroon in the 1980s, there was
over 80 percent mortality in the swine population over large parts of
the country when the virus 1st appeared.

Of course, over time mortality rates drop as the disease becomes
endemic but a case fatality rate of 28 out of 32 (87.5 percent) and a
mortality rate of 28 out of 37 (75.6 percent) indicates that either
this is a new strain for this population or they are managed under
inadequate conditions, or both.

The location of the outbreak right next to the border with the
Democratic Republic of the Congo can be seen on the OIE interactive
