The outbreak of chikungunya illnesses in the Caribbean continued to grow, according to the weekly report by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) released 14 Feb [2014].

Combined with local media reports quoting government sources, the total number of confirmed and probable cases of this mosquito-borne illness has reached 2115. That is an increase of 662 illnesses (30 per cent) in the last week.

The French islands of the Antilles continue to be the center of the chikungunya epidemic. Martinique is especially hard hit, with 844 cases and a 63 percent increase in illnesses in the last week.

The French side of St. Martin has now reported 653 cases and the smaller island of St. Barts [Barthelemy] 270. Guadeloupe has reported 253 chikungunya cases. The Dutch side of St. Martin [St. Maarten] has reported 65 cases, while English-speaking Dominica has 13. Aruba, Anguilla, and French Guyana are seeing imported cases thus far. The British Virgin islands reported no new cases this week and 6 for the entire outbreak. There have been no confirmed locally acquired chikungunya cases on the [central or south American] mainland.

Chikungunya (CHIKV) is a viral illness spread human-to-human through the bite of a mosquito. Until early December 2013, it had never been locally acquired in the Western Hemisphere. The illness was 1st discovered in French St. Martin and has spread from there.

Fox News discussed the potential for chikungunya to spread to the United States in an article on 11 Feb [2014]. Dr. Laura Harrington, a professor of entomology at Cornell University, told Fox: "We definitely should be concerned." The mosquitoes that carry the virus, _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_, are already found in the United States. There is no vaccine for chikungunya [virus] and no cure.

Winter vacations, Caribbean cruises and upcoming spring break trips will be affected by the chikungunya outbreak to some extent. The Centers for Disease Control updated its watch for CHIKV on 6 Feb [2014]. The Public Health Agency of Canada updated its travel health notice on 12 Feb [2014]. Neither agency is urging travel restrictions at this time. Both suggest that preventing mosquito bites is the best strategy for preventing chikungunya [virus infections]. Mosquito repellents and the use of screens and netting in buildings are among their suggestions.

Minister of Health and Labor Cornelius de Weever clarified on Wednesday [12 Feb 2014] at the Council of Ministers' weekly press briefing that the Dutch and French side authorities are working closely together to combat the infestation of mosquitoes in order to curb the chikungunya virus.

Minister de Weever said that his Ministry is working very closely with the community in the clean-up campaign that is taking place in various districts. He said that people need to cooperate with the clean-up campaign because this virus will impact the economy and eventually everyone will be affected financially.

In responding to questions, the Minister of Health said that there are medications on both sides of the island to deal with the symptoms which can be considered to be lifelong symptoms. The Minister further explained that there is no anti-viral medication available for the chikungunya virus, but there are medications to help manage the pain and fever that comes with the virus.

Minister de Weever said so far there have been 65 cases of chikungunya virus reported on the Dutch side [St. Maarten]. He said that persons that are infected with chikungunya should remain at home in order to contain the virus. "When someone has chikungunya [viremia] and a mosquito bites them, then that mosquito becomes infected, and when that mosquito bites another person, the virus spreads. The best thing to do as soon as you are diagnosed with the virus is to stay home."

Minister de Weever also called on persons that have information on areas that are infested with mosquitoes to contact the Ministry of Health and Labor so that the inspectors can go to the area and conduct an assessment.

When asked whether the government of St. Maarten has come to the point where they will fine people that are refusing or not adhering to the pleas of government to clean their surroundings, the Minister said at the moment they are working hand in hand with the community to clean up the various districts. "However, I am sure if the need arises to work with the Prosecutor's Office on matters such as this, then that possibility will be available to them."

An expert brought to Dominica in light of a local outbreak of the mosquito-borne disease chikungunya is warning of a pandemic if the disease is not brought under control quickly. "If it doesn't get under control, it is going to be another pandemic, and it is going to be worse than dengue," Yale University entomologist Dr. Durland Fish told Kairi FM's Healthy Environs, Health People.

According to the World Health Organization, a pandemic is the "worldwide spread of a new disease."

"We need to have emergency measures to try to bring this epidemic under control, and we have only a week or 2 to do that," Fish said. "If we cannot contain this in 2 weeks, we are going to wind up like Martinique and Guadeloupe" [which it did - Mod.TY].

Officials say there has been a total of 13 confirmed cases of the disease in Dominica. They say it was confined to Bath Estate and Woodfordhill, but Chief Environmental Health Officer Anthony Scotland said it is spreading across the island.

"The disease is spreading to several communities," he told the same program on Kairi FM. "It has moved out of the major areas of Woodfordhill and Bath Estate. We have seen it in Scotts Head, Soufriere and Grandbay and a couple in Marigot." Scotland said there are reported cases in Kingshill, Goodwill, Roseau Central, Mahaut and Massacre. He described Bath Estate as the epicenter of the disease and said there have been some severe cases in a small section of Woodfordhill called Small Farm. "We moved into Bath Estate," he said. "We did a lot of work on the ground, working with the patients and the contacts and wider environment to see how we can stem the flow of that disease."

Meanwhile, the Public Health Agency of Canada has issued a travel notice to Canadians traveling to several Caribbean islands, including Dominica. "There have been confirmed cases of chikungunya on the Caribbean islands of Saint Martin/St. Maarten, Dominica, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint-Barthelemy and the British Virgin Islands. These cases mark the 1st time that locally acquired transmission of chikungunya has been detected in the Region of the Americas," the agency said in the travel notice. The agency recommend that travelers to the islands take precautions, such as protecting themselves from mosquito bites, particularly during peak mosquito biting times in the early morning and late afternoon.

Chikungunya is a viral disease, carried mainly by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, and causes a dengue-like sickness. Symptoms include a sudden high fever, severe pain in the wrists, ankles or knuckles, muscle pain, headache, nausea and rash. Joint pain and stiffness are more common with chikungunya virus infections than with dengue viruses. Persons who have these symptoms are advised to report to the nearest health centre or their personal health care provider.

The type of mosquito that transmits chikungunya virus is also known to transmit dengue fever virus.

[Cases of chikungunya virus infection in the Caribbean islands continue to accumulate. However, only Martinique appears to have significantly increasing incidence, and the other localities have stable or decreasing weekly numbers. No transmission on the mainland has been reported, although the risk remains.
