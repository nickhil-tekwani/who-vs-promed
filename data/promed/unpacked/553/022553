Yesterday three inhabitants of Zhambyl Region were admitted to hospital
with suspected hemorrhagic fever. According to the Agency for Emergency
Situations, they all were bitten by ticks. The diagnosis has been confirmed
in two of them. Emergency anti-epidemiological commissions and centres are
working in the Region. The territory around localities where hemorrhagic
fever has been found - [?Eltary, Subskan], Talas and Moinkum districts, the
lower reaches of the Shu and Talas rivers -- is being treated against ticks.

[This is a report of a suspected tick-borne hemorrhagic fever, which could
be many things but may be Omsk hemorrhagic fever (caused by a tick-borne
flavivirus and sometimes transmitted by means other than ticks), Russian
Spring-Summer encephalitis (also caused by a tick-borne flavivirus),
Kyasanur Forest disease (also caused by a tick-borne flavivirus, recently
reported to be circulating in India), hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome
(caused by a hantavirus; rodent-borne), or any of many other infectious
agents. What is "suspected" here, the etiologic agent or the clinical
picture? That the diagnosis (confirmation of the clinical picture or
determination of the etiologic agent?) "has been confirmed" tells us little
or nothing at all. Many people are fed upon by ticks, so such "information"
is not significant at this point. If any of our Kazakh or Russian readers
have useful data, please send it to ProMED-mail. - Mod. CHC]
