One man was diagnosed with dengue plus Crimean-Congo virus [CCHFv] in Karachi.

Provincial minister for health Jam Mehtab Hussain Dahar said: "The man from New Karachi, a butcher by profession, is diagnosed with dengue plus Crimean-Congo virus. He has been admitted to the isolation ward of the Civil Hospital Karachi and is now in stable condition."

[CCHF virus is endemic in Pakistan. Cases of CCHF occurred in Sindh provinces this year (2015) and in various parts of Pakistan last year (2014). With significant livestock movements into urban areas in preparation of the feast celebrating the Eid, there is a significant risk of infection for those involved in slaughtering the animals and others in contact with the bodily fluids of those animals (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150930.3679955). This is likely to be how the butcher was exposed. Health care workers attending CCHF patients also need to be aware of their risk of infection in coming into contact with blood, so having the patient in an isolation ward is prudent.

The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent (although serious, not "almost invariably fatal" as the above report states). The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities can also occur.

The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.

CCHF virus is a tickborne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_.
