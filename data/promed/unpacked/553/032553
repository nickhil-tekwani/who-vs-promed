Report on Epidemiological analysis of the 2006
bluetongue virus serotype 8 epidemic in
north-western Europe: provisional findings
through 31 Jan 2007 (Last updated: 11 Apr 2007)
-----------------------------------------------------
Executive Summary
Bluetongue (BT) is an arthropod-borne
non-contagious viral disease of domestic and wild
ruminants, affecting particularly certain breeds
of sheep with severe clinical disease, including
mortality. On 14 Aug 2006, a private veterinary
practitioner in the southern province of Limburg,
in The Netherlands, notified the veterinary
authorities of BT-suspect cases on 4 different
holdings in that Member State. These were the 1st
suspicions of a rapidly-spreading BT virus
(BTV)-epidemic in northern Europe, which has
since affected cattle and sheep holdings in
Belgium, Germany, France, Luxembourg, and The
Netherlands. On 28 Aug 2006, the CRL [European
Community Reference Laboratory] in Pirbright
announced that BTV-serotype 8 (BTV-8) was causing the outbreaks.
The veterinary authorities of the 3
initially-affected countries (Belgium, Germany,
and the Netherlands) decided at the onset of the
BTV-epidemic in northern Europe to form a
research group with epidemiologists from these
countries in order to provide science-based
decision support for future BTV monitoring and
surveillance. The European Food Safety Authority
(EFSA) was requested by the European Commission
(EC) to carry out a global epidemiological
analysis of the ongoing outbreak. Therefore a
BTV-8 epidemiology working group (BTV-8WG) was
established by EFSA on 6 Oct 2006.
This report describes the results of the
different tasks that were performed through 31
Jan 2007 to determine the conditions for
introduction, establishment and spread of BTV-8
in northern Europe. They concern the following
aspects of the outbreak investigation:
1. The introduction of the BTV-8 serotype; which
focused on the place, time and possible routes for this introduction;
2. A section on clinical aspects in which the
nature and severity of the disease caused by this strain are described;
3. The characterisation of within-herd spread
which is of relevance to assess the ratio of
sub-clinical versus clinical cases. This has
implications for detection of BTV-8-infected herds;
4. The information on factors favouring virus
establishment includes the results of vector
surveillance in the affected countries and
factors that can affect virus persistence such as
animal densities, environmental factors, and meteorological conditions;
5. Elements that may influence short-distance
spread that were studied include observed speed
of local spread and the characteristics and pertinence of the 20 km zones;
6. Finally, in the section on factors affecting
long-distance spread into new areas the potential
for vector spread through wind and restrictions
on animal movements were considered.
These provisional results, to be delivered by 31
Jan 2007, were presented to the BTV-8WG on 6 Feb
2007 and to the Chief Veterinary Officers (CVOs)
at an EC meeting on 7 Feb 2007 in Brussels. Using
the feedback from the meetings on 6 and 7 Feb
2007, the reports were revised and finalised.
The final outcome of a full epidemiological
analysis on the identification of associations or
causality between disease incidence and possible
risk factors requires a multiple variable
analysis assessing all possible risk factors
simultaneously. Such an analysis was not
achievable in the time frame given to generate
this 1st report. Thus, the focus of this report
is more of a descriptive and exploratory nature.
The initial findings reported by the EFSA
bluetongue working group are reported below.
1. Statistical modelling showed that the initial
infection occurred in the area close to
Maastricht [Province of Limburg, south
Netherlands]. Difficulties in the initial
diagnosis were due to the fact that the disease
was thus far not known (exotic) in the area. An
obvious source for the introduction of BTV-8,
such as import of infected ruminants, could not
be identified and the exact origin and route of
the introduction of BTV-8 thus far remains unknown. However,
-the absence of legal import of ruminants from outside the EU into the AFI; and
-the absence of BTV-8 from southern Europe
suggest that the introduction of the BTV-8
infection into the more northern part of Europe
took place via another route. Hence, the
potential for introduction via mechanisms other
than those that have been previously incriminated
also need to be considered. Specifically, the
potential for Culicoides to be imported along
with or independently of the import of animals,
plants or other �materials', and the
effectiveness of measures to reduce such a
possibility, merit further study. [See commentary].
2. Clinical signs in BTV-8 infected herds were
expressed differently in cattle herds and sheep
flocks. BTV-8 associated clinical signs were much
more prominent in sheep than in cattle.
3. Based on the (sparse) data from whole herd
sampling there was a trend suggesting a high
proportion of cattle to be PCR and seropositive
in infected cattle herds and a small proportion
of sheep to be PCR and seropositive in infected sheep herds.
Taken together with the results on clinical
signs, these findings therefore suggest that
-for sheep flocks a monitoring system based on
clinical signs could be considered; and
-for cattle a monitoring system based on
serological surveillance appears to be the more effective approach.
4. The BTV-8 virus was found to be present in
vectors (_Culicoides_ species) which are endemic
to north-western Europe. _C. imicola_, which is
thought to be responsible for at least 90 percent
of BTV transmission in the Mediterranean Basin,
was not found once amongst a total of 100 000
Culicoides collected in the infected MS. This
demonstrates that species endemic to the
Palaearctic region are quite capable of
transmitting BTV and judging from the rapid
spread of the virus no pre-adaptive phase was
required in the indigenous Culicoides. One of the
species found to be PCR-positive was _C.
dewulfi_, a species which breeds exclusively in the dung of cattle and sheep.
Vectors of BTV in other parts of the world have
been shown to transmit a range of other viral
pathogens of livestock (African horse sickness
virus, Akabane virus, epizootic haemorrhagic
virus, equine encephalitis virus) [the authors
probably refer to "epizootic haemorrhagic
disease" (EHD) and "equine encephalosis" (EE)
viruses. The latter, a viral disease thus far
identified only in South Africa, is known to be
transmitted by culicoides, in contrast to Equine
encephalitis and Equine encephalomyelitis
viruses, known to be transmitted by mosquitoes. -
Mod.AS]; this suggests that such pathogens may be
transmitted if they were to be introduced into
northern Europe during climatically favourable
periods. However, overall, there is a paucity of
information on the behavioural activities of
vector species of Culicoides, especially in
relation to their interactions with host animals
and their biting activities. Detailed data are
urgently required before clear and reliable
recommendations can be provided to the veterinary authorities on the subject.
The discovery that larger numbers of Culicoides
may be found indoors than outdoors, and
especially towards the end of the season, demands
that the earlier attempt to declare the
vector-free period to be when "�<10 Culicoides
are found in a light trap suspended outdoors for one night" be refined.
The daily variation of [the] number of Culicoides
captured in The Netherlands were found to be
correlated with prevailing temperatures, for all
species. The prevailing high temperatures in the
summer of 2006 resulted in high numbers of
various Culicoides species. Thus, the warm(ing)
climatic conditions may favour the establishment
of these viruses after they have been
adventitiously introduced in a new part of
Europe. The number of new bluetongue cases over
time was equally influenced by changes in
temperatures. The lag time between a change in
temperature and a correlated change in number of
outbreaks was estimated to be about 4 weeks. This
resulted in an initial peak and then a 2nd peak
of new cases which were separated by a cooler period.
Besides temperature, the number of observed
bluetongue cases was also related to other
environmental factors such as altitude and animal density.
5. Local spread was modelled and found to occur
at a rate of about 15 km per week. The timing of
implementation of the 1st restriction measures
and the timing of the implementation of
subsequent changes to these restriction measures
did not coincide with subsequent changes in the pattern of the epidemic curve.
6. It was demonstrated that wind may affect
spread over long distances. In particular, the
density of the observed wind events contributed to explain, at least in part,
-the predominant horizontal (east-west) spread the epidemic,
-the more limited spread north and south spread, and
-the absence of recorded outbreaks in the U.K.
In conclusion, changes in climatic conditions
coupled with frequent travel might increase the
risk in the appearance and the establishment of
diseases in parts of Europe that were thus far exotic for those regions.
A final report based on data obtained through 1
Feb 2007 and on analyses conducted through 31 Mar 2007 is under review.

[A puzzling aspect of the BTV-8 epizootic is its
introduction to northern Europe. According to the
report, the exact origin and route of this
introduction remains unknown. This statement is
based upon the exclusion of the 2 theoretically
anticipated conventional routes, namely:
a. Legal import of ruminants from outside the EU
into the Area of First Infection (AFI); and
b. Presence/spread of BTV-8 in southern Europe.
A convincing exclusion of possible previous
presence of BTV-8 in European territories south
of the AFI could be obtained by a
serosurveillance in sampled ruminants (preferably
bovines) throughout the said area, similar to the
surveillance which has, reportedly, been
undertaken by Switzerland (with negative
results). It will be helpful if such data, in
case available, be included in the final report.
