The authorities in New Caledonia have confirmed that 3 people have been infected with chikungunya [virus].

A woman with chikungunya [virus infection] was identified in Poindimie in the far north. She had come from the Noumea area where authorities believe she was infected with the mosquitoborne disease, which has spread from Indonesia to Papua New Guinea.

This comes as health services are stretched by a dengue outbreak, which this season has affected more than 8000 people and killed 3.

The head of public health, Dr Jean Paul Grangeon, has appealed to the public to be very vigilant and to take measures to eliminate breeding grounds for the mosquitos. He says chikungunya symptoms, such as fever and pains, are more severe than dengue, with possible relapses for several years.

[Arrival of chikungunya virus in the midst of a significant dengue outbreak is unfortunate. Health professionals may have difficulty in differentiating chikungunya virus and dengue virus infections in febrile patients. With health care services already stretched, it is reasonable to assume that laboratory capability is also over-burdened. One hopes that ongoing chikungunya virus transmission does not occur, although with abundant vector mosquitoes already present, that may be unlikely. However, the chikungunya virus outbreak in New Caledonia in 2011 was halted.
