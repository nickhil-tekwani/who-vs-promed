Visceral leishmaniasis in the Republic of South Sudan
-----------------------------------------------------
In September 2009, an outbreak of visceral leishmaniasis was reported
in the states of Upper Nile and Jonglei which are now part of the
newly formed country of the Republic of South Sudan. Since this time
the outbreak has continued with increased numbers of cases and has
spread to the states of Eastern Equatoria and Unity [1].

As of 28 October 2011, more than 18 000 cases and 720 deaths have been
reported since the outbreak began. A total of 7827 cases have been
reported in 2011 which is an increase over 2010 case numbers [1,2].

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the number of
deaths is likely to be under-reported due to the lack of a cohesive
infrastructure and the prevalence of remote communities [2]. This is
further complicated by thousands of people returning from northern
Sudan to settle in endemic areas of the Republic of South Sudan.
Insecurity in the affected states restricts access to health care and
treatment, and malnutrition, poor housing, mosquito net shortages, and
environmental changes escalate the problem [1]. There is concern that
thousands of lives will be at risk during the peak transmission season
through December [1].

WHO is supporting the Republic of South Sudan's health authorities
through provision of drugs, laboratory diagnosis, training of health
staff, and by developing an integrated management strategy to guide
vector control [1].

In order to ensure that treatment sites receive essential supplies
during the rainy season, when roads are impassable, boats are being
made available to facilitate movement of medical supplies [1].

Visceral leishmaniasis
----------------------
Visceral leishmaniasis is caused by parasitic protozoa of the genus
Leishmania. The parasite is transmitted via the bite of infected
sandflies. In advanced infection, symptoms include: fever, weight
loss, enlargement of the liver and spleen, anaemia if not treated.
Visceral leishmaniasis has a mortality rate of 95 percent [1].

Advice for travelers
---------------------
Travelers to and persons returning to live in the Republic of South
Sudan should follow good insect bite avoidance, particularly between
dusk and dawn. Sandflies are small enough to pass through standard
mosquito nets. However, mosquito nets impregnated with permethrin are
usually effective. There no vaccine against any type of
leishmaniasis.

[Sudan, including Southern Sudan, is endemic of leishmaniasis.
Leishmaniasis is spread by sandflies. The main reservoir is dogs and
the main vectors are _Phlebotomus papatasi_ and _P. orientalis_
(Dereure J et al. Visceral leishmaniasis in eastern Sudan: parasite
identification in humans and dogs; host-parasite relationships.
Microbes Infect. 2003;5:1103-8).

Leishmaniasis is a chronic infection with a high mortality in
untreated cases. Malnutrition is a main contributing factor to
clinical disease. Leishmaniasis is also a HIV related disease, but HIV
infection rates are low in South Sudan (Rai RK et al. Prioritizing
Maternal and Child Health in Independent South Sudan. Matern Child
Health J. 2011 Sep 30. [Epub ahead of print]). HealthMap location:
