The ProMED-mail post "GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH INTELLIGENCE - CANADA" includes the
statement:
>Over the past two decades alone, at least 29 new infectious diseases have
>emerged worldwide, including HIV, Ebola fever, and Legionnaire's disease.
That statement is incorrect. Ebola "emerged" in 1976, outside the
two-decade time frame mentioned. The first canonical outbreak of
Legionnaire's disease (in St. Elizabeth's Hospital, Washington D.C),
occurred in 1965[1, with one case occurring as early as 1947[2.
If, as Jack Woodall mentioned, ProMED-mail is regarded as "the gold
standard," then it should not be promulgating the common misconception that
a newly recognized disease is somehow synonymous with "a new infectious
disease."

[Ed is right to quibble. The statement was lifted by the reporter from a
report that was issued before 1996, when the reference to two decades was
correct. We should have pointed that out. If we are going to be
absolutely correct, then we should also note that retrospective studies
have shown the first human cases of HIV occurred at least 4 decades ago -
