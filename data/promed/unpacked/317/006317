Following an FMD outbreak in domestic animals, quarantine has been
declared since 2 May 2007 in the Batken oblast (region).
Erkin Tashtanov, the Head of Batken's regional Veterinary Services,
reported the recording of 78 cases in livestock as of 2 May 2007. The
figure might be much higher, since not all animals had undergone
veterinary investigation.
Reportedly, the main source of infection was related to imported
animals from neighboring republics. Tashtanov also noted that
prevention, control and eradication measures are being applied;
quarantine imposed; cattle markets closed; and veterinary inspection
posts installed on the pastures of the rural settlement of Karabulak,
where most FMD cases have been identified.

[Batken oblast can be seen in southwest Kyrghyzstan, bordering
Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, in the map available at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/kyrgyzstan_pol_05.pdf>.
According to the most recent available Kyrgyzstan reporting to the
OIE on its disease situation (2004), the last FMD outbreak was
recorded there in February 2001. No reports have been sent in 2005
and 2006, but according to the Kyrgyzstan page on the website of the
World Reference laboratory for FMD (WRLFMD), it appears that FMD
virus (FMDV) of at least 2 serotypes, O and Asia 1, has been
circulating there during the recent years. Three Kyrgyzstan-origin
FMDV isolates have been received at the Pirbright laboratory on 22
Mar 2007, one dating back to 2004 (strain Asia 1-KRG/1/2004), the 2
others isolated in 2006, namely strains O-KRG/1/2006 and O-KRG/2/2006; see at
<http://www.iah.bbsrc.ac.uk/virus/Picornaviridae/Aphthovirus/fmd_genotyping/asia/krg.htm>.
Since 2005, each member-country of the OIE is obliged to provide
semi-annual reports on its animal-disease situation, pertaining to
each of the diseases included in OIE's list. Those periodic reports
are additional to immediate notification reports, which should be
sent subsequent to the detection of any emerging or recurring
disease. Not a single report has been sent by Kyrgyzstan throughout
the said period. - Mod.AS]
