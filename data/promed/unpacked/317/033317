Measles Outbreak: Tens of Thousands Exposed?
--------------------------------------------
Federal health officials are scrambling to prevent a massive measles
outbreak after a young woman traveled through 3 airports this week
with an active case of the highly contagious [measles] virus. The
27-year-old woman, who tested positive for measles, departed the U.K.
before traveling through airports in Washington, DC, Denver, and
Albuquerque last Tuesday [22 Feb 2011] exposing possibly tens of
thousands of passengers to the disease.

"Public health authorities consider this a medical urgency, if not an
emergency," said Dr. William Schaffner, professor and chair of the
department of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. "They will
do everything they can to track down everyone to see if they are
indeed protected."

Because measles is transmitted through the air, health experts say
passengers who traveled on the same planes as the woman, or passed
through the same airports could have been exposed. "Measles is the
most communicable virus that we know and it can be transmitted not
just person to person, but over considerable distances because it
wafts in the air and then people can inhale it when they are some
distance away," Schaffner said. While the CDC [Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention] is trying to tracking down the passengers,
airport officials are doing the same with employees.

In the U.S., only about 60 cases of measles are reported to the CDC
each year. Health officials say children who never received an
immunization or adults who declined to be immunized are at greatest
risk. "It's a potentially devastating illness," Schaffner said. "It
still kills many children worldwide, so this is not a disease which we
wish to reintroduce into the United States."

Measles can take 18 days to develop, so it may be a while before the
scope of the exposure is fully recognizable. The CDC says the woman
who tested positive had not not immunized because of her religion
[religious beliefs].

[In summary: As of Sun 27 Feb 2001 no cases of measles have been
diagnosed, other than the single passenger in transit through several
airports in the USA en route to Albuquerque, New Mexico, via airports
in Washington DC, Denver, and Albuquerque.

A report by WBALTV
(<http://www.wbaltv.com/news/27010380/detail.html>) gives a slightly
different itinerary stating that the passenger departed from
Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport on a 7
p.m. flight to Denver on 22 Feb 2011. The same traveler had been also
at Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia on the
afternoon of Sun 20 Feb 2010.

A 3rd itinerary for the same 27-year-old woman has been reported by
Associated Press
(<http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_17492753

source=3Drss_viewed&nclick_check=3D1>), stating that San Diego-County
and federal health officials are investigating whether passengers were
exposed to measles after an infected person traveled on a Southwest
Airlines flight from Baltimore to San Diego. San Diego County public
health chief Wilma Wooten says Flight 3423 traveled 22 Feb 2011 and
had a stopover in Denver, where passengers got off and on the plane.

A 4th itinerary was reported by AOL News on Mon 28 Feb 2011
<http://www.aolnews.com/2011/02/27/traveler-may-have-spread-measles-in-5-us-airports/>
stating that the New Mexico woman was on a transatlantic flight from
London to Dulles International Airport in Washington, DC, on 20 Feb
2011 is believed to have passed through airports in Baltimore, Denver,
Albuquerque, and San Diego. New Mexico authorities refused to identify
the woman, but described her as a 27-year-old who had never been
vaccinated for measles as a child. Her symptoms were apparent on her
flights and she was diagnosed once she arrived home in New Mexico.
State health departments are trying to contact flight attendants and
any passengers who were sitting within 5 rows of the infected woman on
her flights last week.

More than 10 million people are infected with measles worldwide each
year and U.S. law requires that any cases of measles be reported to
public health authorities.

The final destination in New Mexico of the passenger is not stated in
any of these accounts. And as of Tue 1 Mar 2011 no secondary cases
have been reported. - Mod.CP]

Taiwan reports 1st case of indigenous measles this year
-------------------------------------------------------
A 20-year-old college student was the 1st person to contract measles
in Taiwan this year [2011], the Center for Disease Control (CDC) said
yesterday. The patient, who attends school in Taipei, came down with a
rash on Fri 18 Feb 2011, the center said. Further investigation found
that the student had received a vaccine against measles when she was
one year old. However, there was no record of follow-up vaccination
after she entered elementary school, CDC Deputy Director-General Shih
Wen-yi said in an interview. 2 days before the rash developed, the
patient visited Pingsi Township for the sky lantern festival and the
Shifenliao area in New Taipei City, she said.

So far, the CDC has tracked 15 people who had contact with the
student, and 2 of them have reported feelings of discomfort, Shih
said. To prevent the disease from spreading, the CDC called for
passengers who took Taiwan Railway trains on 16 Feb 2011 to and from
Taipei, Pingsi and Shifenliao to conduct self-health management.

Taiwan had 12 confirmed cases of indigenous and imported measles last
year, CDC statistics show.

Measles outbreak hits Mt Druitt area
------------------------------------
An outbreak of measles has families in the Mt Druitt, St Marys and
Rooty Hill on high alert. New South Wales (NSW) Health issued a
warning earlier this week to be on the look out after 8 confirmed
cases in the past month.

Communicable diseases manager for the local public health unit Dr
Vicky Sheppeard said there had been an increase in the eastern states
this year in reported cases of measles. "Measles is one of the most
easily spread diseases and just being in the same room as someone with
measles can result in infection," she said. "Around one in 5 people
who catch measles require hospitalisation."

The public health unit has been working with local hospitals, GPs
[general practitioners] and schools to identify and contact people who
may have been exposed to the infection. Symptoms begin around 10 days
after contact with an infected person. So people need to be
particularly aware of any signs of infection in themselves or their
children during this week. "Anyone who develops these symptoms should
seek advice from their GP," Ms Sheppeard said. "We ask that people
ring ahead to say that they could have measles and ask to be seated in
a separate waiting room to avoid spreading the disease to others."

Children should be vaccinated against measles as one- and
5-year-olds. Adults between 25 and 45 are often susceptible to measles
because when they were young only one dose of vaccine was
recommended.

Serenji measles contained
-------------------------
Serenji District Hospital has recorded a total of 371 cases of
measles which have been successfully treated since November last year
[2010]. And 30 patients are currently being treated at the measles
centre in Serenje district. Serenje District Medical Officer Tiza
Mfune disclosed to ZANIS that the 371 cases of measles do not include
those that were treated at rural health centres in the district.

Last month, the Serenje District Health Management Team (DHMT) had
carried out a government-sponsored measles mop-up immunisation
campaign in which thousands of children from the age of zero to 5
years were vaccinated.

The disease, which was 1st recorded on 25 Jan 2010, is believed to
have been introduced into the district by a resident of Lusaka's
Mandevu compound who visited the area and became sick while there.

Meanwhile, the number of people dying from measles in the district
has continued to reduce. Serenje District Commissioner Stanley
Chibwana said despite the epidemic spreading to most parts of the
district, there have been very few deaths. Mr Chibwana said this is
because Government has intensified efforts to curb the disease and
disclosed that over K200 million [USD 42 016.80]will be spent on the
fight against the epidemic.

addition to the current outbreak in Serenji a serious outbreak was
recorded in Solwezi District in October 2010.
