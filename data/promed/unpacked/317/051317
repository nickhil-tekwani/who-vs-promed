This increase [noted in the prior posting cited above is an excess of the
normal seasonal variation. The number of cases, although high (78) is not
the highest weekly total on record for this season. It is however
considerably higher than the previous weeks total of 42 cases, (i.e. the
week of 1st to 7th January). The pattern of occurrence for the week shows a
higher than average age distribution and there is a suggestion that the
rural distribution might not be uniform, but the numbers in individual
rural local authority areas are small. There is no obvious single source
apparent at this stage but investigations are not complete.
