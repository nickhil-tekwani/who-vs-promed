[2] Research funding
Date: Thu 21 Aug 2014

http://www.ukcds.org.uk/news-events/news/emergency-research-call-to-tackle-ebola


A rapid research call on the spread of EVD has been announced, aiming to commission and complete research to combat the outbreak within 2 months. The Department for International Development and the Wellcome Trust are jointly funding the research under the GBP 6.5 million [about USD 10.8 million] Research for Health in Humanitarian Crises (R2HC) programme. Under-resourced health systems have been struggling to cope with the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa and the death toll has now reached over a 1000. The research will cover the management of the outbreak and might be in areas such as epidemiology, clinical management, ethics, diagnosis, disease control and prevention, health systems, and surveillance.

In a separate initiative, also announced today [21 Aug 2014], the Wellcome Trust has committed GBP 40 million [about USD 66.5 million] to the launch of the Developing Excellence in Leadership, Training and Science (DELTAS) Africa initiative. This is a long-term vision for developing a new generation of outstanding African health researchers to help tackle future challenges like the Ebola outbreak. The funding will be administered by the Enhancing Learning and Research for Humanitarian Assistance (ELRHA). "The gravity of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa demands an urgent response," said Dr Jeremy Farrar, Director of the Wellcome Trust. "The Wellcome Trust is investing today in a package of research that can make a difference to Africa in the short, the medium and the long term."

[Research results will be too little, too late for this epidemic. One has to wonder whether those USD 77 million might not be better spent in the field trying to stop West African countries becoming failed states as a result of EVD, and the spread of EVD to richer countries which will end up spending much more than that to protect themselves. - Mod.JW]

[3] Suspected cases


Ireland
-------
21 Aug 2014: Tests are being carried out on the remains of a man who is said to have died after recently returning to Ireland from West Africa. A man in Ireland who medics suspect may have died from Ebola is believed to have recently returned from Sierra Leone, according to Sky sources. The suspected victim was named locally as a father of one, from the Doorin area, outside Mountcharles, County Donegal. The 43-year-old was visiting his large family [there] when he was taken ill, having previously been living in Dublin. Neighbours said he may have been receiving treatment for malaria when he died. His body is being kept at Letterkenny Hospital in isolation. It is not known where he had been receiving any treatment as an inpatient at a medical facility. One source said he had been working in the West African country for a telecommunications company and had returned within the last couple of weeks.

Viet Nam, Myanmar
-----------------
20 Aug 2014: Viet Nam and Myanmar are testing 3 patients for the deadly Ebola virus after they arrived in the Southeast Asian nations from Africa suffering fever, health officials said; 2 Nigerians were sent to Ho Chi Minh City's Tropical Diseases Hospital for isolation after they arrived in the city by plane, Viet Nam's health ministry said, adding that they did not have symptoms other than fever. Airline passengers sitting next to the pair -- who travelled to Viet Nam on Monday [18 Aug 2014] from Nigeria via Qatar -- have been advised to monitor their health.

In Myanmar, a 22-year-old local man was taken to hospital in Yangon after arriving at the city's main airport on Tuesday [19 Aug 2014]. The Myanmar Centre for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention said he is believed to have returned from Guinea, having also travelled to Liberia, 2 of the countries worst hit by the Ebola outbreak. "Samples were sent to a WHO (World Health Organisation) recognised laboratory to check whether or not Ebola was present," the statement said. It added that 4 people who accompanied the man to hospital were also being kept under observation ... [more]
