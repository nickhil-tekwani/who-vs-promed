Uganda reports more Ebola cases and deaths
------------------------------------------
Uganda over the past few days has reported 2 more Ebola cases, along with 9 more deaths, raising the confirmed totals to 130 cases, 43 of them fatal, the World Health Organization (WHO) Uganda country office said in its latest updates.

Officials have also reported 21 suspected cases, all of them fatal, from earlier in the outbreak. The event began in early September [2022], and the virus may have been circulating for as long as 3 weeks before the 1st case was detected. The outbreak involves the rarer Sudan Ebola strain, for which there are no approved treatments or vaccines.

Young girl infected
-------------------
The 2 latest cases were in Kassanda, 1 of 7 affected districts. One involves a 9-year-old girl, and no details were available about the other patient. Both were contacts of known cases.

Regarding the latest deaths, 3 were reported as part of case management data reconciliation. Of the other 6, 5 were reported from Mubende, one of the main hot spots. The other involved a patient who died at an Ebola treatment center in Entebbe. The case-fatality rate among lab-confirmed patients is 33%.

Outbreak responders have identified 1777 contacts across 8 districts, and 87% of them are under monitoring.

17 cases in Kampala
-------------------
At a WHO briefing today [2 Nov 2022], Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said Mubende is still the most affected district, but cases have recently risen in 2 neighboring districts. He said that, so far, 17 cases have been confirmed in Kampala, the country's capital and largest city.

"Although these cases are linked to known clusters, the very fact that there are cases in a densely populated city underscores the very real risk of further transmission, and the very urgent need for increased readiness in districts and surrounding countries," Tedros said.

He also added that the WHO yesterday [1 Nov 2022] released an additional USD 5.7 million from its emergency contingency fund to further support the response.

[2] Rising threat

Rising Ebola cases in Uganda spark regional concern
---------------------------------------------------
More than a month after an Ebola outbreak was declared in Uganda, infections continue to climb, and the World Health Organisation has upped its Ebola risk assessment for both the country and wider region since it reached the capital, Kampala.

Rather than Uganda having contained the virus, "the risk can be assessed to be very high at the national level, and high at the regional level," the WHO said in a 28 Oct 2022 update -- a step up in threat level from previous evaluations. It continued to describe the global risk as low.

There were 130 confirmed Ebola cases and 43 deaths by 31 Oct 2022, according to Uganda's ministry of health, a case fatality rate of 33%. The lack of a licensed vaccine for the "Sudan" strain present in Uganda and the spread of the outbreak to Kampala have magnified the public health dangers, the WHO warned.

Since the outbreak was declared on 20 Sep 2022, the highly contagious virus has surfaced in 6 rural districts clustered in the centre of the country -- Mubende, Kassanda, Kagadi, Bunyangabu, Kyegegwa, Wakiso -- as well as Kampala, a city of 3.6 million people in the south.

After hopes the initial cases might have been contained, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director-general, said he remained concerned about the potential for future spread: "there may be more chains of transmission and more contacts than we know about in the affected communities".

The government initially denied last week that there were infections in Kampala, but has since acknowledged 17 cases have been detected -- 13 of them linked to a single family, and 6 of those children attending 3 local schools. The education ministry has kept schools open, but has banned graduation parties for primary and secondary school students.

Underlining the alarm over the spread of the haemorrhagic fever, Tedros tweeted last week that tackling Ebola in urban areas is complex, requiring "coordinated & sustained efforts to interrupt transmission".

"There's congestion, there's slums, there's high frequency in terms of movement," ministry of health spokesperson Emmanuel Ainebyoona told The New Humanitarian. "So it becomes quite challenging once you're doing contact tracing."

The number of contacts listed for follow-up has ballooned to over 2100 as of 31 Oct 2022, with reports of logistical failures -- including a lack of vehicles -- hampering tracing.

Uganda's 6 neighbouring countries -- Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, and Tanzania -- have all stepped up their readiness preparations, the WHO noted.

Lockdown debate
---------------
The index case in Kampala was a man who had escaped from an isolation centre in Mubende in September [2022] to seek treatment from a traditional healer, and then travelled to his relatives in the capital. Rather than reporting his condition, his family hid him, his true identity only becoming known after his death.

That suggests a lack of trust in the authorities by some citizens, according to Samuel Oledo, president of the Uganda Medical Association (UMA). "It is catastrophic that right now, [some] people are not even reporting cases," he told a local radio programme.

The government locked down the 2 hardest-hit central districts -- Mubende and Kasanda -- for 21 days on 15 Oct 2022. The measures have included an overnight curfew, closure of places of worship and entertainment, and movement restrictions. A mobile laboratory has also been deployed in Mubende.

There have been calls for similarly stringent measures for the congested capital. "The earlier we lockdown Kampala the better," said Oledo. "Ugandans are still taking [about Ebola] as something so minor."

There has also been criticism that President Yoweri Museveni has downplayed the seriousness of the outbreak -- a marked contrast to COVID-19, when Uganda imposed one of the world's longest lasting lockdowns.

But Ainebyoona, the health ministry spokesperson, said a lockdown would be premature. "Scientifically, it's not necessary," he added. "It depends on the epidemiological trends, and also [that] we follow up on contact tracing."

Although Kampala residents are worried about Ebola, a lockdown would be unpopular -- especially as people are already struggling with rising fuel and food costs. With memory still fresh of the damage caused to the economy by COVID-19, there has been political and public pushback over suggestions of renewed restrictions.

"We are still suffering from the effects of the lockdown of COVID-19," Musoke Thaddeus Nagenda, the chair of the Kampala City Traders Association, told The Daily Monitor newspaper last week. A lockdown, he said, would be "very unfortunate".

Lack of resources
-----------------
Uganda has coped with multiple Ebola outbreaks, including a case of the Sudan strain in 2000 that claimed more than 200 lives. The government says its priority is financial support for its USD 18 million response plan.

It's a call echoed by WHO executive director Mike Ryan. "We need more scale-up. We need more support for that scale-up," he told a media briefing in Geneva on 12 Oct 2022.

But Uganda's underfunded public health system was already struggling before the increased pressure of the Ebola outbreak, and by the beginning of November [2022] there was little evidence of a scaled-up response thus far, at least in Kampala.

"Of course, we need more health workers; we are recruiting," said Ainebyoona from the health ministry, adding that shortages of personal protective equipment were almost inevitable: "PPE -- there will never be enough -- because these are consumables, they get depleted."

Kampala's main isolation unit is adjacent to its main referral hospital Mulago, which the ministry says is currently housing 50 contacts from the Kampala and Wakiso districts who will now be moved to create space for the admission of suspected and confirmed cases.

Within the next 4 weeks, the ministry said, it planned to build another facility at Mulago's adjoining sports field that will have 64 beds, boosting the capacity to care for 351 confirmed cases in the capital.

The government is also struggling to protect and compensate health workers. So far, 15 confirmed Ebola cases have been among health staff, with 6 deaths. The UMA has been pushing for frontline workers to receive hazard pay, and medical interns have threatened to strike without better support.

Private clinics are typically the preferred destination for patients before turning to a public facility.

Although they are connected to the national health surveillance system, not all are equipped to meet Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) best practice standards. "We are going to do an assessment," said Ainebyoona. "Those who are short of IPC requirements will be closed."

Vaccine hopes and regional fears
--------------------------------
Classic public health measures to control epidemics -- isolating patients and quarantining their contacts -- can be effective, but they are difficult to implement. Vaccines, however, could be a game-changer.

There are now 2 licensed vaccines for the more common "Zaire" strain of Ebola, which claimed more than 11 000 lives in 3 West African countries between 2013 and 2016, and more than 2200 lives in neighbouring DRC in 2018-2020.

Development work has been slower on the Sudan version, but 3 candidate vaccines exist -- produced by Merck, the non-profit Sabin Vaccine Institute, and Oxford University.

The 3 experimental vaccines will be tested from next week, with shots given to 150 people, according to Uganda's health minister, Jane Ruth Aceng.

Uganda's outbreak is so far the 8th largest on record, amid fears gaps in contact tracing may see its further spread. Neighbouring countries are heightening border surveillance in a region where cross-border movement is key to many people's livelihoods. Kenya, Rwanda, and Tanzania are among those now screening all arrivals from Uganda at official checkpoints.

[The list of problems that make this outbreak challenging is long: logistical failures, lack of adherence to safe burial protocols, no licensed vaccine or antiviral, spread to a congested city of 3.6 million, Kampala, increasing number of contacts with shortage of vehicles for tracing, lack of trust in authorities leading to poor reporting of cases, and a struggling public health system. And people are burned out from COVID, further exacerbating the inadequate response. It's important that the world pay attention and not let this outbreak gain more ground. - Mod.LK]

[3] WHO situation report 38
Date: Mon 31 Oct 2022
Source: CIDRAP from WHO [abridged, edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/10/ugandas-ebola-cases-rise-who-ups-risk-assessment


... The WHO said in its latest outbreak update, based on information as of Oct 26 2022, that the case fatality rate among lab-confirmed cases is 27.8%.

It said though Uganda has experience responding to Ebola outbreaks and has taken quick actions, the lack of treatments and vaccines for the more rare Sudan Ebola strain that's fueling the outbreak poses a serious public health risk.

The WHO is revising its formal risk assessment, but said given the geographical expansion to urban settings, the risk to Uganda has been elevated from high to very high, and the risk to the region has been increased from low to high. It added that the global risk remains low.

Six neighboring countries have stepped up their readiness actions: Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, and Tanzania.

In Uganda, outbreak responders are monitoring 1656 contacts in 10 districts, with a follow-up rate of 88%.

Six schoolkids test positive
----------------------------
In other outbreak developments, Uganda's education ministry has banned school tours and parties for students graduating from primary and secondary schools, due to recent concerns about potential Ebola transmission in schools, according to the Uganda Daily Monitor [https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/ebola-govt-bans-school-visitations-leavers-parties--4003394].

Last week, health officials said 6 children from 3 schools in Kampala tested positive for the virus. All were contacts of a man who traveled from Kassanda district to Kampala, where he died from Ebola in a local hospital.

Also, Uganda's health ministry on 28 Oct 2022 announced that all contacts of confirmed cases are barred from local and international travel for 21 days. It said of the 5 initially affected districts, transmission has been interrupted in all but Mubende and Kassanda, both of which are under 21-day movement restriction.

[5] Exhumation of body

23 infected with Ebola after exhuming body
------------------------------------------
Exhumation of bodies by locals in Kassanda is the main cause of the escalating Ebola cases in the district, a top health official has said.

Dr Geofrey Bwire, the assistant commissioner in the Ministry of Health, said when specialised district burial teams bury those who have died of Ebola, residents exhume the bodies at night to perform rituals on them.

"About 2 weeks ago, our teams buried someone in Kalwana Village, Kikandwa Sub-county, who had succumbed to Ebola but the locals waited for them to leave and at night, they exhumed the body and performed burial rituals on it. Since bodies of those who have died from Ebola are highly infectious, many people were infected," Dr Bwire told a meeting on Ebola response in the district yesterday [1 Nov 2022].

He said following the exhumation, 23 confirmed cases were registered out of the total 42 in the district, adding that 546 contacts were traced out of that burial.

The Health minister, Dr Jane Ruth Aceng, cautioned residents against exhuming the bodies, saying they risk having the district population wiped away.

"The communities need to understand that those bodies are very infectious. That is the message the leaders need to carry to the communities," Dr Aceng said. Dr Godfrey Ekuka, an official from the Health ministry, called for beefing up of their burial teams with more police officers, saying some errant locals had threatened to beat them up.

Dr Munir Safieldin, the Unicef representative, called for more community sensitisation.

"The communities highly regard rituals. So we need to have a different approach to behaviour change and that is what we advocate for at Unicef. There are not enough police officers to guard the graves of those who have died of Ebola but sensitising them (residents) about the dangers of touching bodies would solve this challenge," Dr Safieldin said.

[There absolutely needs to be adherence to safe burial practices. The infectiousness of bodies following death has been clear since earlier outbreaks. The best way to educate the people so they understand the need for this a challenge; community leaders must become involved. - Mod.LK]

Groups detail support for Uganda's Ebola vaccine trials
-------------------------------------------------------
The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, and the WHO today [3 Nov 2022] spelled out a plan to speed up research during Uganda's ongoing Ebola outbreak, with a goal of ensuring that the country has access to doses of investigational vaccines against the Sudan Ebola virus.

Currently, there are no licensed vaccines or treatments against Sudan Ebola. Uganda's health ministry recently announced that 3 candidate vaccines will be tested in the current outbreak setting. They are from Oxford University in the United Kingdom and Sabin Vaccine Institute and Merck in the United States.

In a joint announcement today [3 Nov 2022], the groups also said they would facilitate the scale-up and access to any vaccines that are licensed following the clinical trials, which will be facilitated by Makerere University Lung Institute in Uganda.

Goals of the collaboration
--------------------------
"The following goals have been identified for the organizations' efforts; these are likely to evolve in response to the outbreak.

- In the short term, supporting the Ministry of Health of Uganda's outbreak response efforts as needed to control SUDV and, under their leadership, support a randomized clinical trial to evaluate one or more candidate vaccines as part of the response to the outbreak.
- In the mid-term, allocating resources to plan for and to reserve sufficient manufacturing capacity to scale up the production of candidate vaccines (even before they are licensed), potentially by establishing a risk-sharing mechanism. This may also involve manufacture of additional vaccines at risk during the trial to ensure that doses of a vaccine found to be efficacious vaccine can be made available to end the outbreak as quickly as possible.
- Over the longer term, exploring pathways to ensure that licensed SUDV vaccine(s) are available via the Ebola stockpile, which is enabled and funded by Gavi and managed by UNICEF on behalf of the WHO-coordinated International Coordinating Group (ICG) mechanism on Vaccine Provision, potentially using innovative market shaping mechanisms.
- Furthermore, committing to developing a mechanism to ensure equitable access and funding for SUDV vaccines research, outbreak response and preventive vaccination. Also, to provide support for development and evaluation of next generation vaccines. ..." - Mod.LK
