Strain variation in iatrogenic CJD between France and the UK?
-------------------------------------------------------------
A study of the distribution of codon 129 polymorphism in patients in France
and the United Kingdom (UK) with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)
transmitted iatrogenically by human growth hormone (hGH) -- the commonest
cause of iatrogenically transmitted CJD -- has shown marked variation (1).
Among the patients registered by the end of 2000 the frequency of
methionine-methionine (MM) genotype was much lower in the UK (4 per cent, 1
of 27 cases) than in France (62 per cent, 48 of 77, p=0.0001). The authors
suggest that different genotypic distributions of hGH-transmitted CJD in
French and UK patients may be due to infection with different contaminating
strains of the CJD agent in France and the UK.
The difference could not be attributed to the distribution of genotypes in
the normal population or to incomplete ascertainment of early cases in the
UK; and it was also unlikely to have arisen as a result of differences in
treated populations (the genotype distribution in hGH recipients was
assumed to be similar to that of the normal population, for which there was
no difference between countries), in the treatment regimens used, or in the
hGH production process. There is little evidence of a similar situation
pertaining to variant CJD [abbreviated as CJD (new var.) or vCJD in
ProMED-mail], but the surprising international finding emphasizes the need
for caution in interpreting the downturn in vCJD cases in the UK (2). Cases
of vCJD reported to date have so far been associated with a single genotype
(MM); they may, however, represent only the initial manifestations of one
strain among a number that may still be incubating in other genotypes. With
the study also showing that hGH-transmitted CJD homozygous cases in France
(of which 74 per cent (48 of 65) were MM) arose significantly earlier than
in heterozygous cases, and given the huge exposure opportunity of the UK
population to the BSE agent, the findings reconfirm the need to be vigilant
for cases of vCJD among other genotypes. International surveillance will be
vital over the coming years.

[It is not very surprising that strain variation in iatrogenic CJD may be
observed in different countries, since the hGH preparations administered
may not be identical. The significance of the report lies in the
observation that hGH-transmitted CJD homozygous cases in France arose
significantly earlier than heterozygous cases, and the consequent inference
that vCJD cases might appear after a more prolonged incubation period in
heterozygous patients. - Mod.CP]
