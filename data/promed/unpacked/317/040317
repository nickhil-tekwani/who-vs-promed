Vaccine advisors for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today [14 Oct 2021] unanimously approved a 3rd and smaller dose of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine for vulnerable groups. Today's meeting of the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) was the 1st of 2 days of booster-dose deliberations, which tomorrow [15 Oct 2021] will cover the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and mix-and-match strategies.

In advance of tomorrow's VRBPAC meetings, a research team based at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) yesterday [13 Oct 2021] released a preprint study suggesting that all vaccine combinations were well tolerated and immunogenic, but Johnson & Johnson recipients got a bigger immune response from an mRNA vaccine booster than a 2nd dose of their original vaccine (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.10.21264827v1.full.pdf).

In their vote, the 19-member group said the available data support the safety and efficacy of a booster dose of the Moderna vaccine, under emergency use authorization (EUA), in the same groups as for the Pfizer-BioNTech booster: those ages 65 and older, those ages 18-64 who are at risk of severe COVID-19, and those ages 18-64 whose frequent exposure in institutional or occupational settings put them at high risk for serious COVID-19 complications.

The decision is nonbinding, and FDA officials will make the final decision before handing the recommendation discussion off to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) vaccine advisory group, which will meet next week to weigh the latest booster developments.

In their Moderna booster discussions, the group had to navigate a more complicated course than they did last month [September 2021] for the Pfizer-BioNTech boosters. Earlier this week, Moderna announced that its request for booster-dose authorization was for a half-strength version for people ages 18 and older -- 50 micrograms rather than 100 micrograms. It said the half dose would raise antibody levels while minimizing side effects and would allow the company to beef up the global supply of the vaccine.

Separately, the federal officials had advised in August [2021] that those with moderate or severe immune compromise receive a 3rd dose of an mRNA vaccine at least 28 days after the initial 2 doses. Health workers will need to consider 2 different dosages when offering additional doses of the Moderna vaccine.

In an FDA briefing document released on 12 Oct 2021 ahead of the VRBPAC meeting, the agency's scientists said data on the Moderna vaccine revealed a mixed picture on the need for boosters, with some recent effectiveness studies showing declining efficacy over time against symptomatic infection or against the delta (B1617.2) variant, and others showing no drop-off. They concluded that all COVID-19 vaccines that are authorized in the United States protect against severe disease and death (https://www.fda.gov/media/152991/download).

Tomorrow [15 Oct 2021] VRBPAC will discuss and vote on Johnson & Johnson boosters. Earlier this month, the company applied to amend its emergency use authorization (EUA) for its one-dose vaccine in those 18 and older to include a booster dose. It presented data that suggest a booster increases effectiveness to 94%. Currently, the one-dose vaccine is 71% protective, according to the CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7038e1.htm). Afterward, the group is also slated to discuss mix-and-match doses, but it's not clear if they will vote on the issue.

Regarding the NIH preprint study, which hasn't been peer reviewed, researchers found that those who received the Johnson & Johnson shot had stronger antibody levels after they got an mRNA vaccine booster, rather than a Johnson & Johnson booster. The study included 458 people who received a different vaccine 12 weeks after their initial shot, examining 9 different vaccine combinations. The Moderna vaccine was assessed at the full 100-microgram dose.

Also, those who received either Moderna or Pfizer initially and received a booster of the other company's mRNA vaccine had similarly robust immune responses.

Leana Wen, MD, former Baltimore health commissioner and contributing columnist for the Washington Post, said yesterday [13 Oct 2021] on Twitter that the key finding for Johnson & Johnson recipients was that neutralizing antibodies rose 4 times after the Johnson & Johnson booster, 35 times after a booster of the Pfizer vaccine, and 76 times after a Moderna booster shot.

[2] Kids as reservoirs for variants

Using COVID-19 viral load and viral cultures from 110 children, researchers suggest that children may serve as reservoirs for COVID-19, furthering transmission and viral evolution (https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiab509/6396772). The researchers created a prospective cohort of patients 21 years or younger who sought care at Massachusetts General Hospital or its urgent care clinics between April 2020 and 2021 (median age, 10 years). About 56% were boys, and 38% were Hispanic. Thirty-six children (33%) required hospitalization, of whom 18 required supplemental oxygen or respiratory support of any kind.

Thirty patients (27.3%) were asymptomatic, and they were more likely to be younger than those with mild disease. Those who were hospitalized with low oxygen levels were significantly older than those in both groups.

Asymptomatic children and those with mild disease had significantly higher viral loads than adults hospitalized with COVID-19 with comparable symptom duration, according to the study. No viral load difference was seen with hospitalized pediatric COVID-19 patients and hospitalized adults of similar illness duration. Adult patient data were derived from the Massachusetts General Hospital COVID-19 Biorepository from April-August 2020.

Of 126 pediatric respiratory samples, the researchers cultured live virus from 33, including 8 taken from asymptomatic children. Higher viral load was predictive of live virus shedding but similar to viral load observation, age was not associated with viral culture results.

"Our results suggest that the low rates of transmission in settings such as schools and daycares cannot be attributed to low viral loads, low rates of viral shedding, or rapid clearance of virus in younger patient populations," the researchers write, asking policy makers to consider how mitigation efforts for vaccinated adults may affect children. "Our results additionally suggest that pediatric populations have the potential to serve as a community reservoir of actively replicating virus, with implications for both new waves of infection and the evolution of viral variants."

The researchers note that SARS-CoV-2 lineages reflected those in the community of the time: 57 samples from 54 children showed 4 alpha (B117) variants, 3 iota (B1526.2) variants, and no delta (B1617.2) variants.

[From a commentary by Susie Flaherty in the Harvard Gazette on the above-discussed report from the Journal of Infectious Diseases (JID):

"Most children are asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic when they develop COVID-19, giving the misconception that children are less infectious. Studying the virologic features of SARS-CoV-2 in children with COVID-19, and how SARS-CoV-2 infection differs between children and adults, is an essential component for establishing effective public health policies, not only to ensure safety within the school but also for controlling the pandemic, says [Lael] Yonker [pediatric pulmonologist at MGH (Massachusetts General Hospital) and co-1st author of the JID paper with Julie Boucau, senior research scientist at MGH and the Ragon Institute].

"As COVID-19 variants continue to emerge, infected children are potential 'reservoirs' for the evolution of new variants as well as potential spreaders of current variants, she says. 'Kids with COVID-19, even if asymptomatic, are infectious and can harbor SARS-CoV-2 variants. Variants could potentially impact both the severity of the disease and the efficacy of vaccines, as we are seeing with the delta variant. When we cultured the live virus, we found a wide variety of genetic variants,' adds Yonker. 'New variants have the potential to be more contagious and also make kids sicker.'

"Yonker emphasizes that the group's findings reinforce the importance of masking for children: 'The implications of this study show that masking and other public health measures are needed for everyone -- children, adolescents, and adults -- to get us out of this pandemic.'

"Increasing awareness of pediatric COVID-19 and implementing broader testing programs for children are 2 of Yonker's aspirations. According to the CDC, the 'true incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is not known due to lack of widespread testing and the prioritization of testing for adults and those with severe illness.'

"Yonker adds: 'To develop effective public health policies, we need data-driven public health guidance. Kids are an essential component of beating the COVID-19 pandemic, and we must learn more about how they are affected and interact with others'" (https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/10/study-confirms-kids-as-spreaders-of-covid-19-and-emerging-variants/). - Mod.LK]

[3] Sweden: obesity

High body mass index (BMI) was independently associated with death and longer intensive care unit (ICU) stays for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, according to a study published yesterday [13 Oct 2021] in PLOS One (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0257891).

The researchers looked at Sweden's nationwide ICU population from 6 Mar-30 Aug 2020 and found 1649 adults with COVID-19, of whom 78.3% were at least overweight (25 kilograms per square meter [kg/m2] or more). Besides having an overrepresentation of obese people compared with Sweden's general population (39% in the cohort), the study group also consisted of more men (74.4%). Mean age was 60.1 years.

Higher BMI was associated with the composite outcome of death during ICU stay or an ICU stay longer than 14 days in survivors, even after adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, and illness severity (odds ratio [OR] per standard deviation increase, 1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16 to 1.44). Those with a BMI of 35 kg/m2 or higher (class 2 or 3 obesity) were at double the risk of the composite outcome, the researchers note.

"Based on our findings, we advocate that BMI is included in the severity scoring for patients with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care and suggest that individuals with obesity should be more closely monitored when hospitalized for COVID-19," write the researchers.

"In a large prospective study [by Schmidt et al (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-020-06294-x)], 94% of all participating ICUs reported that the COVID-19 pandemic led to a need of extended number of ICU beds," they add. "Thus, the prolonged [length of stay] is an important factor not only for the individual patient but also as an important factor for health care, putting excess strain on ICUs during the COVID-19 outbreak."

Kompaniyets L, Goodman AB, Belay B, et al. Body mass index and risk for COVID-19-related hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and death -- United States, March-December 2020. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2021; 70: 355-361; http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7010e4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
------
"What is added by this report? Among 148 494 US adults with COVID-19, a nonlinear relationship was found between body mass index (BMI) and COVID-19 severity, with lowest risks at BMIs near the threshold between healthy weight and overweight in most instances, then increasing with higher BMI. Overweight and obesity were risk factors for invasive mechanical ventilation. Obesity was a risk factor for hospitalization and death, particularly among adults aged less than 65 years.

"What are the implications for public health practice? These findings highlight clinical and public health implications of higher BMIs, including the need for intensive management of COVID-19-associated illness, continued vaccine prioritization and masking, and policies to support healthy behaviors."

Discussion
----------
"The findings in this report highlight a dose-response relationship between higher BMI and severe COVID-19-associated illness and underscore the need for progressively intensive illness management as obesity severity increases. Continued strategies are needed to ensure community access to nutrition and physical activity opportunities that promote and support a healthy BMI. Preventing COVID-19 in adults with higher BMIs and their close contacts remains important and includes multifaceted protection measures such as masking, as well as continued vaccine prioritization and outreach for this population." - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, 10 countries, including the USA (89 680), UK (44 826), Turkey (30 709), Russia (31 299), Ukraine (18 881), India (17 004), Romania (16 383), Iran (11 964), Germany (11 756), and Thailand (11 276), have reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 7916 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 12 Oct 2021 to late 13 Oct 2021). A total of 50 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 27 of the 50 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 4 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 5 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 5.9%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 6.2%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 13.1% decrease in daily reported cases and a 6.7% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily report counted over 400 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 240.37 million cumulative reported cases and over 4.89 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
