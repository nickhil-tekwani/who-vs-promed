In response to ProMED-mail's RFI's in postings 20170815.5251541 and 20170825.5274779 about lumpy skin disease in Kazakhstan:

1. It is understood that the government of Kazakhstan officially announced the presence, in 2017, of nodular dermatitis [aka lumpy skin disease, LSD].

2. Russian and Kenyan LSD vaccines have been mentioned as the ones applied, and their effectiveness discussed.

3. Private owners of livestock suffer most, because the compensation for each sick cow is minimal. It is necessary to develop an effective compensation scheme for the smallholder livestock owners.

4. The following information on the 2016 LSD event in Kazakhstan was included in a report for the population, by the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Kazakhstan, AI Myrzahmetov, published on [2 Jun 2017]:
"In 2016, 4 foci of nodular dermatitis outbreaks in cattle were reported in the Atyrau oblast. Amendments were made to the legislation and 185 million tenge (USD 551 300) were paid from the republican budget as compensation for the cost of animals that died from this disease.
To date, all liquidation measures have been completed. Preventive vaccination of livestock in Atyrau oblast, as well as in 6 border areas of Aktobe [Aqtobe] (2) and West Kazakhstan (4) oblasts, are coming to an end."

[ProMED-mail is very grateful to the submitter of the information above, addressing 4 issues raised in earlier postings on LSD in Kazakhstan.

The following comments address the issues as numbered above:
1. Additional details (link?) of the mentioned official confirmation, by Kazakhstan's authorities, of the current (2017) LSD event will be helpful. The internationally customary (in fact, required) route for such an announcement is an immediate notification to the OIE.

2. The LSD vaccine applied in Russia (and exported) is, in fact, a sheep-pox vaccine which, following a testing procedure, was recently licensed also for the vaccination of cattle against LSD (see 20170511.5028821).

The Kenyan O-240 vaccine has been recently found to include an LSD virus which underwent a low level of attenuation which may be not sufficient for safe use in cattle. It was suspected to cause clinical disease in vaccinated animals (see in 20140820.2708273).

EU countries currently use a live-homologous LSD vaccine (South-Africa's Neetling virus strain). A European Union LSD vaccine bank has become operational since April 2016. Trials assessing an inactivated vaccine were reportedly undertaken, currently in their final stages.

For a recent assessment of LSD vaccines, please see 20160812.4410864, including the commentary. OIE's Manual chapter on LSD, including exhaustive updated information, is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.13_LSD.pdf.

3. This comment is of high significance. Small-holders, worldwide, may be slow, or even tempted to refrain altogether from reporting the appearance of early signs of a reportable animal disease, if they expect compensations to be under the real damages and payments delayed. Such animals may be (illegally) sold, with consequent spread of disease and -- eventually -- higher national losses and expenditures.

4. The original text, in Kazakh and Russian, is available in Kazakhstan's Ministry of Agriculture blog, at http://tinyurl.com/ydbgtg6k. In case the recent media reports on LSD spreading in Western Kazakhstan are confirmed, it will be of interest to note if the affected farms included vaccinated animals and which vaccines were used.

Kazakhstan's official reporting on the 2016 LSD event was limited to a solitary notification on a single outbreak; no details of the vaccination (numbers and vaccinated animals, geography) were included.

According to the recent official update, LSD was recorded, during 2016, in 4 locations within the Atyrau oblast.

Timely and detailed information on the LSD situation in Kazakhstan is essential for the entire region. This applies also for another livestock disease suspected to be spreading in central Asia, namely PPR (peste des petits ruminants) in small ruminants. - Mod.AS
