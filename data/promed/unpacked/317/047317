The Agricultural Committee pointed out today [10 Jul 2020] that lumpy skin disease (LSD), which occurred in mainland China last year [2019], has spread to the coast. It is suspected that the virus was carried by mosquitoes and flies from Fujian province [PRC] to [the county] Kinmen [Fukien, Taiwan]. The 1st case was notified by Kinmen on 8 Jul 2020.

The Agriculture Commission's Bureau of Prevention and Inspection held an interim press conference today [10 Jul 2020] to announce an LSD outbreak in cattle. Chen Jizhong, chair of the Agricultural Committee, emphasized that he had reported the epidemic situation to Su Zhenchang, the president of the Executive Yuan [the executive branch of the government of the Republic of China/Taiwan], and established the Central Disaster Response Center for LSD, in accordance with the regulations, with him as the convener.

Reportedly, the laboratory tests showed that the genetic sequence similarity to the epidemic LSD virus strain published in China in 2019 was as high as 99%, confirming this event as the 1st case of LSD in Taiwan.

The number of cattle in the affected herd was 548; the Kinmen Epidemic Prevention Office has already completed the killing of 23 sick cattle (one of which died) according to the risk status and will apply other measures to prevent the spread of the virus. At the same time, the clinical inspection of 47 cattle farms within a radius of 3 km (1.86 mi) around the affected farm has been completed. No suspicious cases were found. There is no sign of spread of the epidemic. The inspection of cattle in the county will continue in the future.

LSD is a reportable disease. The pathogen is a _Capripoxvirus_ of the _Poxviridae_ family (sheep pox and goat pox viruses are the other 2 viruses in the genus). The disease affects only cattle and buffalo and is not zoonotic. It is mainly transmitted through arthropods such as mosquitoes and sting flies. It will be notified in accordance with the regulations of the World Animal Health Organization (OIE).

LSD occurred in Saudi Arabia from 2015 to 2016, in Russia in 2017, and entered China in 2019; when China discovered the epidemic in Xinjiang last August [2019], OIE was notified. In early June [2020], media reports informed the LSD spread to Fujian, but OIE has not been notified; likely, the spread to very close Kinmen became feasible by wind and mosquitoes.

It was stated that, to avoid the spread of the virus in live vaccines, the government of Kinmen County will address the vectors -- mosquitoes and flies. Introduction of live cattle from Kinmen to the island of Taiwan was prohibited before the outbreak; dried beef and cooked meat are not prohibited. In addition, from now on, ships, airplanes and other traffic vehicles arriving in Taiwan from Kinmen must be disinfected and treated with insecticides to exterminate the mosquitoes and flies that spread the disease.

[The Kinmen Islands (also called Jinmen and Quemoy), governed by Taiwan, are just offshore of the Fujian province, PRC/China. Their proximity to China led in the past to introductions of animal diseases, such as foot-and-mouth disease (1999, 2012, 2015).

LSD has been recently spreading into and within eastern and south Asia (China, Bangladesh, India); as indicated in the above report, the recent further spread in China, eastwards is yet to be notified to the OIE.

Taiwan has already submitted an official notification on the above 1st LSD outbreak to the OIE, available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=35009. The report includes an interactive map and the following epidemiological comments:

"Suspected clinical signs were observed at the Livestock Research Institute of Kinmen County, and reported by Kinmen County Animal and Plant Disease Control Center on 8 Jul 2020. Samples were sent to the National Laboratory, Animal Health Research Institute (AHRI), for diagnosis. Lumpy skin disease was confirmed by the AHRI on 10 Jul 2020. The farm has been placed under movement restriction. All animals on the infected farm will be culled. Cleaning and disinfection will be conducted after stamping out operation. In addition, there is a total of 47 cattle farms within a 3-kilometer [1.8 mi] radius of the infected farm. The 11 surrounding cattle farms within a one-kilometer [0.6 mi] radius of the infected farm have been first surveyed, with no clinical signs. The remaining 36 cattle farms within a 3-kilometer [1.8 mi] radius of the infected farm will have their clinical surveillance completed soon."

OIE's global LSD interactive map, presenting all reported outbreaks since 1 Jan 2019, is available at https://tinyurl.com/y7v29a4y. The outbreak in Kinmen is already indicated; China presented one single outbreak throughout the period (on its extreme west). Subscribers are encouraged to visit the map and click on various clusters to center, then zoom in to the required resolution (e.g., the border between Russia and Kazakhstan). - Mod.AS
