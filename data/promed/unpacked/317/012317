An Argentinean tourist is dead while 10 other visitors to the island
have been admitted to hospital in St. Ann suffering from suspected
food poisoning.

The group, which comprises tourists from the USA, Japan, Italy, as
well as 4 visiting Jamaicans, was staying at a villa in the
neighboring parish of St. Mary when they consumed a meal of fish and
potato salad late on 22 Dec 2010. Following the meal, they all became
extremely ill.

They were rushed to hospital where a doctor confirmed that the
Argentinean visitor had died. His identity was not released. One of
the other tourists is said to be in critical condition.

[The estimated incubation period and the symptoms associated with the
illness are not stated, but the short period of time suggests a
preformed toxin or that an exogenous poison was involved. ProMED
awaits more information about this unfortunate episode. - Mod.LL]
