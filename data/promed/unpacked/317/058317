Wheat stripe rust has become more prevalent [and] is spreading through Southwestern Ontario, aided by the mild winter. [It] has made its way up from the US.

"We were looking at 30 to 40 per cent or more yield loss," said Albert Tenuta, Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. It's traditionally been confined to the Pacific Northwest, he said. "There has been a shift with the stripe rust into most areas of North America." Ontario and the central US have had milder winters than normal, increasing the amount of stripe rust that overwintered.

Stripe rust is so ubiquitous now that growers are struggling to keep up with the spread of the fungus. There are varieties of wheat that are resistant to stripe rust. But, he said, part of the problem is that new strains are able to bypass the resistant wheat types.

In the last 2 years [2015/16], stripe rust has come in earlier than normal, a farmer said. "We always get stripe rust in Ontario but it (usually) comes in after the wheat is already harvested." If the fungus starts to come in earlier in the life stage of the wheat it can have a devastating effect. "Last year [2016] there were guys that lost half their yields," he said.

The dusty orange fungus called stripe rust cuts wheat yields in half. Especially this year [2017] when there's been an abundance of snow, rain, and cool weather. Farmers are battling the fungus from Louisiana and Texas all the way to Canada. If left untreated, highly-susceptible varieties can lose 60 per cent of their yields. In the Northwest, stripe rust is at epidemic levels.

Xianming Chen, US Department of Agriculture, said stripe rust spores can travel for hundreds of miles on the wind. So infected fields can impact other fields from a long ways away. Farmers are having to make a difficult choice right now: do they spray again, or not spray? That's a significant cost for farmers faced with moderate prices for their wheat.

To battle stripe rust experts like Chen are developing new, stronger varieties of wheat that have better tolerance of stripe rust. They are also working with major chemical companies to come up with new, more-effective fungicide treatments and they are working on the genetics of wheat plants to help find the resistant genes in stronger wheat. Chen also works up a model each year to predict how bad stripe rust will become to help farmers make decisions.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ (previously var. _striiformis_ or _tritici_). The disease affects wheat (_Triticum aestivum_), durum wheat (_T. turgidum_), some barley varieties, triticale (wheat/rye hybrid) and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow leaf stripes, loss of plant vigour, and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100 per cent in wheat.

Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. Grasses and volunteer crop plants may generate a "green bridge", providing inoculum for the next crop cycle. Disease monitoring is important so that timely action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up of inoculum. Disease management may include the use of resistant varieties, fungicide applications and control of pathogen reservoirs. Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been established in different regions for early detection of new rust strains and to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution.

While stem rust (_Puccinia graminis_ f. sp. _tritici_) poses a huge potential threat to world wheat production, stripe rust is currently causing the most damage to wheat crops on a global scale. New strains of both rusts with increased virulence and additional fungicide resistances have been reported in recent years from wheat-growing areas worldwide. Projects for double resistance breeding to manage both stripe and stem rusts simultaneously are in progress (see ProMED-mail post 20120831.1274190).

New strains emerging in North America (for example, ProMED-mail post 20160610.4277039) may be responsible for stripe rust spread to Canada. In addition, climate warming allowing survival of wheat rusts on green bridges into higher latitudes is another example of pathogens extending their range due to climate change (see also ProMED-mail posts 20141024.2895414, 20120809.1235745, 20090914.3230, 20110718.2172).
