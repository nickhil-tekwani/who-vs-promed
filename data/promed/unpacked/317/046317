Health protection officers are investigating an _E. coli_ outbreak in
Plymouth believed to be linked to crab meat. Environmental health
officers and the Health Protection Agency (HPA) launched an inquiry
after 9 cases were confirmed in the city. It is believed to be the 1st
reported outbreak of the _E. coli_ O157 strain associated with the
consumption of crab.

The investigation is continuing but there is a suspected link with an
unapproved crab supplier. Investigators revealed they took action
after 9 cases emerged in August 2011. There have been no further
reports of illness linked to crab since.

The South West HPA and Plymouth City Council said in a joint
statement: "A wider investigation is still ongoing following on from
the outbreak, so we are not in a position to give full details but we
suspect a link to an unapproved crab supplier. Environmental health
officers from the council acted swiftly to identify crab meat as a
possible source and removed all potentially affected crab meat from
food establishments as a precautionary measure. The team worked
closely with the SW (North) Health Protection Unit to investigate the
cases and ensure that GPs in Plymouth and beyond were aware of the
issue, if anyone presented with symptoms."

The team also alerted food outlets in the city about the importance of
only buying food or ingredients from approved or registered
suppliers.

A study into the outbreak showed a "statistically significant"
association between cases and the consumption of crab meat away from
home.
