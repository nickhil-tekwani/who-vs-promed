All surgical operations and procedures in a hospital of the London
Health Sciences Centre, University at London, Ontario, Canada, are
currently being rescheduled. A patient on whom brain surgery was
performed on Thu 30 Nov is said to be potentially affected with
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) of classical [familial or sporadic] type.
CJD is caused when protein like particles called prions attack the
brain leading to mental deterioration and ultimately death. It can be
[transmitted] via contaminated surgical equipment [termed iatrogenic CJD].
Of the 2 types of CJD; classical [which includes sporadic and
familial CJD]) and variant CJD [abbreviated as CJD (new var.) or vCJD
in ProMED-mail], the latter has attracted more public attention being
linked to mad cow disease.
Fielding questions from the press, hospital staff said that routine
hospital sterilization procedures do not necessarily inactivate CJD
particles. The hospital has also pulled [withdrawn] reusable medical
and surgical instruments and is in the process of acquiring
disposable instruments, some of them borrowed from other hospitals.
According to Jean Riverin, media relation's officer for the Public
Health Agency of Canada the situation has been controlled and the
risk to others coming to the university health center is extremely low.
