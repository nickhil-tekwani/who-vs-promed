Armenia's Ministry of Health received an alarm with respect to suspicious anthrax cases recorded in the Vardenis district of the Gegharkunik region, the ministry informed Armenian News-NEWS.am.

As a result, an epidemiological study was conducted on location, and laboratory research samples were taken from the persons who are suspected of having caught this disease. The results will be known within the next few days. Preventive measures are in progress.

Spokesperson Babken Pipoyan of the Agriculture Ministry's State Service on Food Safety said on Friday [19 Oct 2012] that the last time anthrax was recorded in Armenia was 3 years ago.

[These may be better labelled as suspected cases, not suspicious cases, as the evidence presented to date indicates merely clinical uncertainty. Hopefully, we will discover the reality in due course and the identified source of infection. Past history [see previous reports listed below] would point at the butchering of moribund animals and public sale of the meat. - Mod.MHJ
