The World Health Organization (WHO) tweeted Friday [20 May 2022]: "Health authorities in #DRC confirmed a 4th case of #Ebola on 19 May [2022]. The case patient, a 12-year-old boy in Wangata, passed away today [Fri 20 May 2022]. WHO is supporting @MinSanteRDC in response to the outbreak."

This is the 4th case recorded since the outbreak started on 21 Apr [2022].

According to a Radio Okapi report, medical sources claim that the victim was a 12-year-old child in the Maman Balako health area. Since 14 May [2022], he had been developing symptoms of Ebola, including fever, fatigue, and blackish vomit.

For 5 days, he was cared for at home, until Thu 19 May [2022], the date on which he was taken to a medical center in the Mbandaka II district. The results of the analysis of the samples taken on the same day from the child were found to be positive for the Ebola virus disease.

But the family put up resistance and brought the child home on Thursday evening [19 May 2022], where he passed away on Friday [20 May 2022] morning.

Sources add that another 9-year-old child died with the same symptoms, in the same neighborhood, on 6 May [2022] and was buried, without post-mortem collection or a dignified and secure burial. This raises fears of a multiplication of cases.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo is experiencing its 14th Ebola outbreak since 1976. The current outbreak is the 6th since 2018 alone, the most frequent occurrence in the country's Ebola history. Previous outbreaks in Equateur province were in 2020 and 2018, with 130 and 54 recorded cases, respectively.

[Radio Okapi also reports that "the response teams are preparing for the decontamination of different places, through which the deceased child passed. They seek the cooperation of the populations around the case and in the health area concerned."

Unfortunately, because the child who died in the same neighborhod on 6 May [2022] was buried without proper protective measures, and without a secure burial, more cases are anticipated. This most recent child was treated at home for 5 days when he should have been immediately taken to the clinic for testing and treatment.

It is notable that all 4 patients who have been reported have died. According to the WHO, 25-90% mortality has been observed in past outbreaks. However, one would have expected a lower CFR in this current outbreak, as effective treatments are now available that should improve chances of survival, and "many people in Mbandaka are already vaccinated against Ebola, which should help reduce the impact of the disease," Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO Regional Director for Africa, said when the outbreak was declared (https://www.afro.who.int/countries/democratic-republic-of-congo/news/democratic-republic-congo-declares-new-ebola-outbreak-mbandaka).

According to OCHA (UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs), 139 case contacts are being followed, and 959 people have been vaccinated to date (https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/republique-democratique-du-congo-epidemie-de-la-maladie-virus-ebola-en-equateur-21-mai-2022-rapport-2). - Mod.LK
