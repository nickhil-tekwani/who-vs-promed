Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever in Uganda - WHO Update 33
--------------------------------------------------
The death from Ebola fever of Dr. Matthew Lukwiya, Medical Superintendent
of Lacor Hospital, Gulu District, has been announced by the Ugandan
Ministry of Health. Dr. Lukwiya had been involved in the fight to control
the outbreak from its first recognition, helped create one of the 2
isolation units, and committed much energy, enthusiasm and hospital
resources to its support. He was an inspirational physician and leader; his
death will be keenly felt by hospital staff, other colleagues, and the
large community served by Lacor Hospital. Dr. Lukwiya may have been exposed
to infected body fluids through his work on the isolation unit. These
circumstances are being investigated by the Ministry of Health.
As of Tue 5 Dec 2000, the Ugandan Ministry of Health has reported
cumulative figures for all affected districts of 370 cases and 140 deaths.
This figure includes 16 new confirmed cases in Gulu district and 9 new
confirmed cases and 5 deaths in Masindi district. It may be noted that the
total number of deaths given is the same as that given in [the Ministry's
previous report due to the inadvertent duplication in reporting of 7 cases.
