[The question about 'inhalation anthrax' arises from the observation that
wood bison bulls display by generating a very high column of dust from
their individual wallows. As wallows have the potential to collect anthrax
spores, it has been hypothesised that this dust column, if it contained
spores, could infect bulls in the vicinity. So far not. But one negative
necropsy does not an hypothesis kill. It should be noted that this outbreak
appears, so far, to be restricted (thankfully) to one area in the WBNP, and
there are no other outbreaks in the Slave River Lowlands nor in the
Mackenzie Bison Sanctuary; places where outbreaks have occurred in the
previous 40 years. Thanks to Jonah for this authoritative update. - Mod.MHJ
