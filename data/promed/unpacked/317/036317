From: Escobar, Miguel <Miguel.Escobar@Merial.com>

The benefits of the mass vaccination campaigns to control canine rabies in
highly populated areas are clearly demonstrated by the outstanding results
achieved in Latin America. In 1990 there were 16,464 reported cases of
canine rabies within the area. In 1998, the number has been reduced to
2,608 (PAHO, Analysis of Progress Report. 1990 - 1998). Human rabies cases
have been reduced from 252 in 1990 to 74 in 1998. Dogs are still the main
source of rabies transmission to humans in the Americas (79.9%).
Human population growth and migration to the cities, with their dogs,
increases the rabies risks in the cities. Mass vaccination of dogs in risk
areas is a confirmed strategy that works cutting down the spread of the
disease from the dogs as a source to the humans as the victims.
