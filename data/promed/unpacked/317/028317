Another 3 cases of hepatitis A have been confirmed in Oamaru [Otago division]. Last week, 3 cases of the virus were diagnosed in children from 2 families associated with Edna McCulloch Kindergarten.

The Southern District Health Board blood-tested 55 children and staff at the kindergarten and medical officer of health Dr Keith Reid said it was "good news", as only 3 others had contracted the virus. Vaccinations for those at the kindergarten were completed yesterday [13 Apr 2018]. Public Health officials would continue to follow up with household contacts of the newly detected cases and would likely extend into next week. Close contacts of those infected who tested negative were offered hepatitis A vaccination as a precaution.

In young children, the virus can occur with no outward signs of infection but in older adults, or those with underlying health conditions, there could be sudden onset of an illness 15 to 50 days after exposure. Tiredness and fever, nausea, and abdominal pain would be followed by jaundice or dark urine.

Although the origin of the virus had not been identified, it was thought to be from outside the country.

[It is unclear if this outbreak was associated with a contaminated food but more likely, the cluster was caused by one case being introduced into the kindergarten and the spread occurred child-to-child. A chart of cases over time could assist in this regard. Universal immunization against HAV, as is done in the USA, could prevent such events. - Mod.LL
