Schistosomiasis -- which broke out in Kindeje, Nzeto district,
northern Ziare province, Angola in October 2008 -- has killed at
least 9 people, a local health official said on Friday [14 Nov 2008].

Paulo Seixas Nelembe, head of the Nzeto District Health Bureau, told
reporters that since October 2008, more than 300 cases of the illness
have been diagnosed.

According to him, the cause of the expansion of the disease is the
poor quality of the water consumed by local people from rivers,
lagoons and wells.

He said more medical workers have been dispatched to the Kindeje area
to carry out awareness campaigns on how to treat water before
drinking it and to distribute anti-parasite medicine to the sick.

Schistosomiasis or bilharziosis is a serious and common disease in
Africa caused by several species of flukes of the genus _Schistosoma_
and which affects internal organs.

and geographical distribution
