Samples collected from 4 patients who recently died have tested positive for enterovirus D68, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is unclear what role the virus played in their deaths. In fact, it's possible that enterovirus had nothing to do with them. The virus is very common, especially in the late summer and early fall, with the CDC estimating 10 million to 15 million infections each year in the United States.

Yet the deaths do raise an alarm because this year [2014] has been worse than some other years, since enterovirus D68 has been sending more children than usual to the hospital with severe respiratory illnesses. It seems to be most affecting children with a history of asthma or breathing problems.

As of Wednesday [1 Oct 2014] the CDC had confirmed 500 people in 42 states have respiratory illnesses caused by enterovirus D68. Those infected include a 10-year-old from Cumberland [Providence County], Rhode Island. She died [22 Sep 2014] at a Hasbro Children's Hospital, according to her obituary, though it wasn't until Wednesday that the state Health Department announced that she'd tested positive for enterovirus D68. Dr. Michael Fine, Rhode Island's Department of Health director, told reporters Wednesday that the girl "died from overwhelming _Staphylococcus aureus_ sepsis." _Staphylococcus aureus_ is a bacterium resistant to many antibiotics, while sepsis is an illness affecting all parts of the body that springs up in response to an infection, according to the CDC.

That determination notwithstanding, Fine also noted that "cultures also showed the presence of enterovirus D68." He explained that the child, who was otherwise healthy, experienced shortness of breath "and really by the time she got to the hospital, everything fell apart very quickly within 24 hours." Fine added that "it's not clear what role the enterovirus had, but clearly (this) was a sepsis death. We don't know which came 1st [referring to enterovirus and sepsis], and that's not possible to know with the current state of our science."

Enterovirus may also be linked to a small number of cases of a mysterious neurologic illness seen in Colorado, Boston [Massachusetts] and Michigan. Doctors in Colorado spotted it 1st -- a group of 10 children hospitalized with limb weakness, cranial nerve dysfunction and abnormalities in their spinal gray matter. Doctors at Boston Children's Hospital have since identified 4 patients with the same symptoms. And a child in Washtenaw County, Michigan, also developed partial paralysis in the lower limbs after being hospitalized with the virus, the Michigan Department of Community Health said Wednesday [1 Oct 2014].

Colorado doctors are treating yet another case of paralysis and muscle weakness in a child, and once again are investigating to see if there is a link between enterovirus 68 and the muscle symptoms. The number of children affected with these symptoms has now reached 10, and there remains some mystery as to how a respiratory virus might be the cause of this kind of muscle problem. Part of what makes this extra baffling is some, but not all of the children were found to be infected with enterovirus 68 -- yet others had a recent history of a different virus, including rhinovirus -- which is the virus that causes the common cold.

We know all viruses have the potential to attack different parts of the body. It's very rare but yet it can happen. In these cases a respiratory virus has caused cough and cold symptoms, and then went on to attack the spinal cord and part of the brain. The main areas affected with muscle weakness have been the shoulders, upper arms, and the hips. A few of the kids have had some slight weakness of the muscles of the face. Out of the 10, 6 have recovered to the point where they could be sent home. There are few details otherwise.

All told, doctors at Children's Hospital say they have treated close to 4000 children with suspected enterovirus 68 since August [2014], and there are thousands more in our state [Colorado] who never had to go to the doctor or even got more than the sniffles. The virus continues to march across the country, and it's not known if there are other causes of muscle symptoms elsewhere -- we just know there is a cluster in Colorado. Note the word cluster -- not epidemic.

You may ask, has anything like this ever been seen before? Yes. Doctors at Stanford in California identified more than 20 causes of paralysis-type symptoms in children after a respiratory illness back in 2012. And like Colorado, the majority of kids had been current with vaccines and protected from the actual polio virus. It was something else causing the complication. Respiratory viruses can cause nerve, and other unusual damage (although rarely). This is not new. We are not sure there is a link between enterovirus 68 and this cluster. It has happened before but it doesn't add up right now. This is an unusual number cases nationally as well as being more severe than we've seen before. The link to enterovirus 68 may be coincidence, it may not. This could even be a new virus or one that's mutated or changed somewhat.

There have been 12 confirmed cases of enterovirus-D68 in Connecticut, according to the state Department of Health. Officials from the state Department of Health said on Monday [29 Sep 2014] that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed an additional 11 cases of the virus that has sickened 277 people in 40 states and the District of Columbia since mid-August [2014]. Earlier this month [September 2014], state health officials said the CDC had confirmed a pediatric case of the illness. A spokesperson from Yale-New Haven Hospital said a 6-year-old girl had been treated at the hospital for enterovirus-D68.

Two cases have been confirmed at Danbury Hospital, according to Dr. Gregory Dworkin, who said positive test results were returned today [29 Sep 2014]. Both patients have been treated and released.

A spokesperson from Yale-New Haven Hospital said Monday that 7 cases have been confirmed at the hospital, and earlier this morning, officials at Connecticut Children's Medical Center said 3 of the 6 samples they sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tested positive for enterovirus-D68. The DPH has reported a total of 13 confirmed cases in Connecticut, but numbers from the affected hospitals indicate 12 total cases statewide. The New Haven school district hasn't had any confirmed cases of enterovirus D-68, but with the one confirmed case in Connecticut so close at Yale New Haven Hospital, the school district is making sure parents are aware of the threat.

CDC: EV-D68 found in 4 patients who died
------------------------------------------------
Federal health officials announced today [1 Oct 2014] that 4 patients who recently died were infected with enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), though it's not clear what role the virus played, while Rhode Island reported that a child died last week of a bacterial infection associated with the virus [see part 1]. In addition, the count of confirmed infections with the respiratory virus climbed by 28, to 500, and Maine is the latest state to have confirmed cases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in today's update. Cases have been reported in 42 states and Washington, DC; almost all the illnesses have been in children. "EV-D68 has been detected in specimens from 4 patients who died and had samples submitted for testing," the CDC said. "The role that EV-D68 infection played in these deaths is unclear at this time; state and local health departments are continuing to investigate."

Regarding the Rhode Island case, CDC officials declined to give any more details on the deaths today. But the Rhode Island Department of Health said in a statement that a Rhode Island child "died last week as a result of _Staphylococcus aureus_ sepsis associated with enteroviral infection (EV-D68)." It added that the combination of _S. aureus_ sepsis and EV-D68 infection is very rare and can cause very severe illness in children and adults. An Associated Press (AP) story today said the child who died was a 10-year-old girl from Cumberland, Rhode Island, who was hospitalized in Providence after she started having trouble breathing. "We are all heartbroken to hear about the death of one of Rhode Island's children," Michael Fine, MD, director of the Rhode Island Department of Health, said in the statement. "Many of us will have EV-D68. Most of us will have very mild symptoms and all but very few will recover quickly and completely. The vast majority of children exposed to EV-D68 recover completely." In most cases the symptoms are limited to a runny nose and a low-grade fever, the statement said.

Meanwhile, there were more reports today of children who experienced polio-like neurologic problems that may be associated with EV-D68. 10 such cases are under investigation in Colorado, and the latest reports cited similar cases in Boston [Massachusetts], Michigan, and British Columbia [Canada], among other places.

Television station WCVB, Boston's ABC affiliate [see part 2 above], reported that 4 children at a Boston hospital who had polio-like symptoms after a respiratory illness are being tested for EV-D68. It said one of the children tested negative and that results in the other 4 were still awaited. A doctor said the children had "significant weakness." Michigan reported an EV-D68 case in a child under 1 year old in Washtenaw County who has been treated and released from the hospital but is now partially paralyzed, The Detroit News reported yesterday [30 Sep 2014].

"We believe this is the 1st case in Michigan where we've seen some of the neurological involvement, some of the limb weakness or paralysis that's been reported in Colorado," said Susan Ringler-Cerniglia, a spokeswoman for Washtenaw County Public Health.

In Canada, officials with the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control yesterday [30 Sep 2014] reported that 2 of 8 patients with confirmed EV-D68 infections developed paralytic symptoms that have persisted for nearly a month. The officials, led by Danuta Skowronski, MD, reported the cases via ProMED-mail, the reporting service of the International Society for Infectious Diseases. One of the patients, between the ages of 15 and 20, required mechanical ventilation early in the neurologic illness and still needs help breathing, the report said. The other patient, who is younger, has left-arm flaccid paralysis and loss of reflexes, which did not improve during 9 days of hospitalization.

States with Lab-confirmed Enterovirus D68 [EV-D68]
--------------------------------------------------
From mid-August to 1 Oct 2014, CDC or state public health laboratories have confirmed a total of 500 people from 42 states and the District of Columbia with respiratory illness caused by EV-D68. The 42 states are Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. This indicates that at least one case has been detected in each state listed but does not indicate how widespread infections are in each state.

CDC is prioritizing testing of specimens from children with severe respiratory illness. Of the specimens tested by CDC lab, about half have tested positive for EV-D68. About 1/3rd have tested positive for an enterovirus or rhinovirus other than EV-D68. In the upcoming weeks, more states will have confirmed cases of EV-D68 infection.

- The primary reason for increases in cases is that several states are investigating clusters of people with severe respiratory illness, and specimens are still being tested for EV-D68. It can take a while to test specimens and obtain lab results. That's because the testing is complex and slower, and can only be done by CDC and a small number of state public health laboratories. As the backlog of specimens is processed, the number of states and confirmed cases will likely increase. These increases will not necessarily reflect changes in real time, or mean that the situation is getting worse.

- Some of the increase will be from new EV-D68 infections since people are more likely to get infected with enteroviruses in the summer and fall. We are currently in the middle of the enterovirus season.
