Milk production in South East Asia has come under threat as it struggles with outbreaks of foot and mouth (FMD) disease. A 20 per cent drop in China's milk production is reported to have taken place in part due to FMD. This, combined with high feed prices and high beef prices, is believed to have led to the slaughtering of around 2 million cows.

Despite official claims that the disease is under control, it is thought that some regions of India are experiencing reduced milk production. Korea is still recovering from an outbreak of FMD in 2008, after it was forced to slaughter 8 per cent of its dairy herd.

The decline in domestic production for these countries is thought to be helping to support the stability in world dairy wholesale prices, which have remained elevated despite increased milk supplies from the key global producers.

[During 2013, China has reported to the OIE a total of 23 FMD foci, 14 of them caused by ("reoccurring") serotype O virus and 9 by a "new" serotype A strain. These foci were spread throughout vast areas of China, in several distant provinces. The number of reported outbreaks is astonishingly low, considering the highly infectious nature of FMD, its reported distribution, and the appearance of outbreaks in neighbouring territories (such as Russia) on China's borders. No outbreaks were reported from the adjacent Chinese territories; see map at http://tinyurl.com/omwmmec (zoom in). Hence, it is plausible that the number of 2013 outbreaks in China and their geographic distribution significantly exceeded the reported data.

Having said that, it deserves to be said that China's decreased milk production may have been influenced, in addition to FMD, by additional factors. One of them, reportedly, was related to the 2008-2010 melamine scandal, which led the authorities to decide to close down small dairy farms while supporting existing and new large dairy operations. In view of high meat prices, dairy cows from the small holdings were sold for slaughter, removing them from continued production.

Decreased imports of powdered milk for an extended period, due to suspected contamination (eventually refuted), reportedly also contributed to decreased milk availability. See also http://www.wantchinatimes.com/news-subclass-cnt.aspx?id=20131127000105&cid=1202, kindly forwarded by Sabine Zentis.

The efficacy of FMD vaccines against the circulating field strains has been questioned in China as well as in India. - Mod.AS]
