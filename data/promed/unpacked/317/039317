Feed sector review prudent after BSE
-----------------
Once the immediate requireme
nts to trace the origin of "cow one" and reopen the border are satisfied,
Canada's defence strategy against bovine spongiform encephalopathy, including
its feed regulations, should be reviewed. There is no explanation yet for how
one Canadian cow got BSE, but the weight of scientific opinion is that the
disease generally spreads through tainted feed. Accordingly, in 1997 Canada
imposed a ban on feeding to ruminants any protein derived from ruminant
mammals.
However, ruminant animal protein can be fed to non-ruminants, such as pigs
and chickens. And pig and chicken protein can be fed to ruminants.
The ruminant feed restriction, coupled with a ban on imports of animals and
feed from BSE countries and a random testing program, was considered a good,
triple firewall against the disease. The system was reviewed by the Canadian
Food Inspection Agency last year [2002]. The similar American system was
approved by a Harvard University risk assessment in 2001. [For a less
complacent evaluation of the USA situation, which is indeed rather similar to
the Canadian one, see the January 2002 report of the United States General
Accounting Office (GAO) to Congressional Requesters, titled "MAD COW DISEASE:
Improvements in the Animal Feed Ban and Other Regulatory Areas Would
Strengthen U.S. Prevention Efforts"; see further in comment. -Mod.AS].
And in the real world, the system appears to have worked. While one infected
cow turned up, testing up and down the chain of association has found no
other cases. Human and animal health in Canada has been protected. But the
export ban since the BSE announcement has cost the industry millions of
dollars per day. Individuals have lost herds, feedlots are warning of
bankruptcy, thousands are laid off.
Given the devastation even one cow has caused, stricter BSE protection
protocols may be warranted. The rendering and animal protein feed sector is
one area that needs review.
Renderers play a vital role in the livestock industry. Only 50-60 percent of
a cow or hog sent for slaughter winds up as meat. The rest, about 50 billion
pounds [22.5 million tons] per year in North America, goes to renderers.
They process the byproduct into industrial and consumer products and
economical high protein animal feed. The revenue helps packers pay for
cattle. Without renderers, this mountain of material would have to be put in
landfills, burned or otherwise disposed of.
Renderers also economically dispose of animals unsuitable for slaughter due
to disease or injury. If not rendered, disposal would pose an environmental
and health risk.
Without doubt, a healthy rendering industry is good for the livestock
industry. But in light of our recent BSE experience, it is prudent to again
look at which animals should be rendered, what material should be allowed
into animal feed and what animals should be allowed to eat it.
The Can$30 billion a year Canadian cattle industry is more than 50 percent
dependent on the whims of the export market. To guarantee access to that
market, Canada should be, and be perceived to be, the safest producer of meat
in the world.

[The US GAO report of Jan 2002 included, among others, the following findings:
"While BSE has not been found in the USA, federal actions do not sufficiently
ensure that all BSE-infected animals or products are kept out or that if BSE
were found, it would be detected promptly and not spread to other cattle
through animal feed or enter the human food supply. With regard to imports,
the USA had imported about 125 million pounds and about 1000 cattle from
countries that later discovered BSE during the period when BSE would have
been incubating.....
"With regard to animal testing to detect BSE, although USDA has steadily
increased the number of animals it tests, it does not include many animals
that die on farms. Experts consider these animals a high-risk population.
"Concerning the feed ban, FDA has not acted promptly to compel firms to keep
prohibited proteins out of cattle feed and to label animal feed that cannot
be fed to cattle. We identified some noncompliant firms that had not been
reinspected for 2 or more years, and instances when no enforcement action had
occurred even though the firms had been found noncompliant on multiple
inspections. Moreover, FDAÂ’s data on inspections are severely flawed and, as
a result, FDA does not know the full extent of industry compliance".

BSE focus shifts to lifting ban
----------------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency begins presenting evidence this week to
the USA that Alberta's lone case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy does not
affect the safety of the rest of the Canadian herd. It will be the beginning
of Canada's veterinary science-backed political effort to regain access to
the American market, which has been closed since the 20 May 2003 announcement
of a BSE cow in an Alberta herd.
At the same time, senior Canadian officials are beginning to review ways to
improve the regulatory system, including a recommendation from an
international experts' panel that Canada ban ruminant animal protein from the
feed system. Since 1997, ruminant protein has been banned from ruminant feed
but it still can be used in poultry and hog rations.
CFIA chief veterinarian Brian Evans announced 9 Jun 2003 that the extensive
investigation of the origins and aftermath of the BSE cow was virtually
complete. But a senior American official is warning that even if the evidence
is accepted that Canadian cattle are safe, opening the border to imports will
not be an immediate decision.
"I promise we will consider that information expeditiously," said Ron
DeHaven, deputy administrator of veterinarian services for the U.S.
Department of Agriculture animal and plant health inspection service. "I
hesitate to be painted into a corner on a timeline."
Until the CFIA's official report is filed, proper risk assessments cannot be
done. De Haven said the Americans also want the official report by an
international panel of experts that evaluated the CFIA response and Canada's
food and feed regulatory system last week. It means the American border
almost certainly will remain closed into the latter days of June 2003, even
if the Canadian work is accepted.
Ulrich Kihm, a former Swiss chief veterinarian and an international expert
on BSE, told a 9 Jun 2003 news conference the international experts were
impressed by Canada's efforts. "I have never seen such a comprehensive
investigation done in such a short time," he said. "They did a very, very
good job." Kihm said the international experts will recommend tighter
surveillance of feed use and an end to use of ruminant animal protein in
animal feed. "It has to be done," he said.
Evans said now that the BSE investigation is "winding down" with no further
evidence of the disease, attention will turn to the political issues of re-
establishing Canada's foreign beef markets and debating new tougher
regulations for inspection and feed.
He said 2700 cattle had been slaughtered and tested and none was infected.
Feed from the rendered cow was traced and no ill effects were found. [Does
this mean that all cattle that consumed that batch of feed have been traced &
remain healthy -- or have been destroyed & their brains have tested
negative? - Mod.JW]
A survey of 200 establishments showed "a high level of compliance" with
proper feed use rules. So at the end of a 20-day investigation of the
origins, movements, progeny and rendered parts of the infected cow, the
mystery of how it contracted BSE remains. Kihm said it is impossible to say
there was just one infected cow. But if another case does not turn up within
2 years, "that would be very encouraging."

[As observed in the UK and other BSE-affected countries, bovines are mostly
infected during their first months of life. It may thus be assumed that the
BSE cow got infected between 1995 (in case she is 8) and 1997 (in case she is
6). The source of infection might have been either imported or locally
produced ruminant-derived meat-and-bone-meal (MBM). In the latter case,
infection could had been cycling in Canada for some time.
How was the contamination introduced? A recent paper by Canadian authors --
R.S. Mosley, S. Chen & N. Rheault -- may shed some light; see table I "Cattle
imported into Canada between 1979 and 1997, from countries reporting the
occurrence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and their disposal"
in "Assessment of the risk factors related to bovine spongiform
encephalopathy", Scientific and Technical Review of the OIE, 2003, 22 (1),
157-178.
The table shows that between 1979 and 1993, a total of 665 live cattle were
imported into Canada from 8 countries which have later been found to be BSE-
infected. 82 of these animals have been "ordered destroyed", 38 "ordered
exported", 12 "died (known)", 68 "slaughtered (known)" and 465 "died or
slaughtered".
The most significant figures relate to imports from the UK and France. 250
live cattle were imported from the UK during the said period, when "likely"
to represent an external challenge to importing countries. 59 of them were
reportedly slaughtered, as well as, probably (up to) 68 others. The organs
unfit for human consumption (specific BSE risk material -- SRM) of some or
all of the slaughtered cattle might have been recycled, entering the
[ruminant] feed chain.
342 cattle were imported from France between 1980-1985. According to the
(modified) EU Geographical BSE risk-assessment opinion (see BSE - Canada:
Geographical BSE-Risk 20030529.1311) , imports of live cattle from France are
regarded "likely" to represent an external challenge to importing countries
since 1980. All, or most of the imported French cattle were slaughtered,
their SRMs most probably recycled -- entering the feed chain.
It might be interesting to note if a complete withdrawal of SRMs from the
rendering plants (as applicable in Europe and other countries) becomes one of
the recommendations of Prof. Kihm's team -- or a total ban on the feeding of
food animals with ruminant-derived MBMs.
The Canadian authorities are to be commended for their decision to nominate
this team, consisting of 4 internationally renowned and experienced experts.
Their report and recommendations are anticipated with great interest and
might have significant impact upon the future BSE policy in North America. -
