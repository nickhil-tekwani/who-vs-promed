ref: Talha Khan Burki. Circulation of influenza, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2: an uncertain season ahead. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(21)00364-7

A new report by the Academy of Medical Sciences has warned that the United Kingdom could face exceptionally large outbreaks of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza during the autumn and winter of 2021-22. The surge in infections could overlap with the spike in cases of COVID-19 that is expected to follow the lifting of lockdown restrictions across the country. "It is clear that the healthcare system must plan for a high burden of respiratory diseases", wrote the authors of the new report. They urged the government to roll out point-of-care joint testing for influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV, and to ensure that the influenza vaccine is widely taken up by eligible populations.

The warning partly reflects the success of the precautions that have been deployed against SARS-CoV-2. Mask-wearing, social distancing, and sharply constrained population movements have dramatically reduced the transmission of respiratory pathogens such as RSV and influenza. Hospitals in Italy and France reported drops of more than 80% in the number of paediatric patients treated for acute bronchiolitis during the 2020-21 season, compared with previous years. Australia, Chile, and South Africa registered just 51 cases of influenza between them over the entire 2020 southern hemisphere winter. In the USA, the 2020-21 influenza season was the mildest since at least 1997, the earliest year for which records are available.

The vast majority of children contract RSV before the age of 2 years. "We now have a whole bunch of children who have not been exposed to the virus for 18 months to 2 years", points out Charlotte Summers, reader in intensive care medicine at the University of Cambridge, UK, and member of the expert advisory group for the Academy of Medical Sciences report. The larger the susceptible population, the greater the risk of a sizeable outbreak once a virus starts circulating.

England discontinued nearly all of its lockdown restrictions on [19 Jul 2021]. Scotland and Wales are scheduled to do the same by mid-August [2021]. Even though there are several weeks of summer remaining, cases of RSV are on the rise (the USA is also seeing an out-of-season increase in RSV detections). Whether this will translate to increased hospitalisations remains to be seen. The Academy of Medical Sciences report recommended that children's wards and paediatric intensive care units should be ready for a potential influx of patients with RSV, otherwise they could find themselves overwhelmed. Modelling studies undertaken for the report suggested that a reasonable worst-case scenario for RSV would entail an outbreak somewhere in the region of 1Â·5-2 times greater than during a typical year, assuming the UK stays out of lockdown.

The results for the modelling studies for influenza were similar. "There has probably been a waning of immunity to influenza, plus we have not had enough cases elsewhere in the world to offer a strong idea of what needs to go into the vaccine", said Summers. The mildness of the 2019-20 influenza season in the UK might have further reduced population immunity.

Much is uncertain. "We do not know what the influenza virus is going to look like when it returns", said Rachel Baker, associate research scholar in the department of ecology and evolutionary biology at Princeton University, USA. "How much did the virus evolve during the period of low case numbers? Will we see a strain that people have been exposed to or vaccinated against in the past?" It is unclear how the British will respond to the easing of the lockdown restrictions. "Without national mandates for things like mask-wearing and distancing, a lot will come down to individual behaviour, and no-one really knows how people's behaviour will change", said Summers. Baker suggested that vulnerable populations should continue wearing masks in crowded public places.

Hospitals will have to quickly identify which patients have influenza and which ones have COVID-19, and ensure the 2 sets of patients are kept separate from each other and from vulnerable patients who do not have any respiratory symptoms. No small task, particularly if the viruses are surging at the same time.

At the centre of the response will be the vaccines for COVID-19 and influenza. More than half of the UK population has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. All adults in the country are now eligible for the 1st dose of the vaccine. In 2020-21, take-up of the influenza vaccine stood at 76.8% for frontline healthcare workers and 80.9% for individuals over the age of 65 years. As it turned out, the healthcare system only had to deal with COVID-19 last winter. This year could be very different. "We could get RSV, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2 circulating at the same time, and we just do not know how that is going to play out", Baker told The Lancet Respiratory Medicine.

[Outbreaks of influenza and SARS vary in size from year to year, but the concern is the lack of immunity generated this past year as everyone was locked down indoors without person to person socializing. Now as events and restaurants and theatres open up, and mask-wearing is inconsistent, there may well be a significant increase in the activity of these 2 respiratory viruses.

As the authors suggest, point-of-care joint testing for influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV, would be very helpful in quickly determining the course of treatment, and encouragement to get vaccinated against influenza would eliminate that virus as a respiratory pathogen. - Mod.LK]

Summary
-------
What is already known about this topic?
The highly transmissible B.1.617.2 (delta) variant of SARS-CoV-2 has become the predominant circulating US strain.

What is added by this report?
During [April-June 2021], COVID-19 cases caused by the delta variant increased rapidly in Mesa County, Colorado. Compared with that in other Colorado counties, incidence, intensive care unit admissions, COVID-19 case fatality ratios, and the proportion of cases in fully vaccinated persons were significantly higher in Mesa County. Crude vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection was estimated to be 78% for Mesa County and 89% for other Colorado counties.

What are the implications for public health practice?
Vaccination is critical for preventing infection, serious illness, and death associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (including the delta variant). Multicomponent prevention strategies, such as masking in indoor settings irrespective of vaccination status as well as optimal surveillance testing and infection prevention and control, should be considered in areas of high incidence.

On [5 May 2021], the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) identified the 1st 5 COVID-19 cases caused by the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (delta) variant in Mesa County in western Colorado (population 154 933, less than 3% of the state population). All 5 initial cases were associated with school settings. Through early June [2021], Mesa County experienced a marked increase in the proportion of delta variant cases identified through sequencing: the 7-day proportion of sequenced specimens identified as B.1.617.2 in Mesa County more than doubled, from 43% for the week ending [w/e] [1 May 2021] to 88% for the w/e [5 Jun 2021].

As of [6 Jun 2021], more than one half (51%) of sequenced B.1.617.2 specimens in Colorado were from Mesa County. CDPHE assessed data from surveillance, vaccination, laboratory, and hospital sources to describe the preliminary epidemiology of the delta variant and calculate crude vaccine effectiveness (VE). Vaccination coverage in early May in Mesa County was lower (36% of eligible residents fully vaccinated) than that in the rest of the state (44%). Compared with that in all other Colorado counties, incidence, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and COVID-19 case fatality ratios were significantly higher in Mesa County during the analysis period, [27 Apr to 6 Jun 2021].

In addition, during the same time period, the proportion of COVID-19 cases in persons who were fully vaccinated (vaccine breakthrough cases) was significantly higher in Mesa County than in all other Colorado counties. Estimated crude VE against reported symptomatic infection for a 2-week period ending [5 Jun 2021] was 78% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 71%-84%) for Mesa County and 89% (95% CI = 88%-91%) for other Colorado counties. Vaccination is a critical strategy for preventing infection, serious illness, and death from COVID-19. Enhanced mitigation strategies, including masking in indoor settings irrespective of vaccination status, should be considered in areas with substantial or high case rates.

Among 18 475 sequenced specimen results reported in Colorado through [6 Jun 2021], a total of 783 infections with the delta variant were identified; more than one half (400; 51.1%) of these occurred among Mesa County residents, even though the county accounts for less than 3% of the state's population. Symptomatic illness was reported in 304 (76%) of the 400 delta variant infections in Mesa County residents and 251 (65.5%) of 383 delta variant infections in other counties. The 7-day percentage of sequenced sentinel specimens identified as SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 in Mesa County increased from 43% for the week ending [1 May 2021] to 88% for the week ending [5 Jun 2021] (Figure). During the 5-week period, 67% (51 of 76) of sentinel surveillance specimens in Mesa County were identified as B.1.617.2 compared with 15% (248 of 1637) of specimens from all other Colorado counties sequenced over the same time frame.

During [22 Apr to 26 Jun 2021], a total of 37 COVID-19 outbreaks were reported in Mesa County; 13 (35%) in residential care facilities, 11 (30%) in schools, 2 (5%) in correctional facilities, and 11 (30%) in other settings. As many as 12 outbreaks, including seven in residential care facilities, had at least one delta variant case. Average vaccination coverage in these seven residential facilities was 87% among residents (range = 50% to 97%) and 50% among staff members (range = 6% to 69%); attack rates among residents ranged from 0% to 54.6% (median = 1.2%) and among staff members from 2.2% to 25.5% (median = 10.0%). A total of 5 of these 7 outbreaks involved at least one case in a fully vaccinated resident or staff member.

Discussion
----------
The delta variant is highly transmissible; within 5 weeks of first identification, the delta variant became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in Mesa County, Colorado and is also now the predominant variant in the United States (5). Higher ICU admissions and case fatality ratios in Mesa County compared with those in the rest of the state are consistent with previous reports that infections with the delta variant might result in more severe outcomes (6,7). The slightly lower crude VE estimate against symptomatic infection in Mesa County may lend support to previous findings that COVID-19 vaccines provide a modestly lower protection against symptomatic infection with the delta variant (8). Alternatively, because the delta variant was circulating at higher levels in Mesa County than in other Colorado counties, the lower VE in Mesa County might reflect the much higher exposure to circulating virus among vaccinated persons.

Vaccination is a critical strategy for preventing infection, serious illness, and death associated with SARS-CoV-2 (including the delta variant). Additional targeted prevention strategies (for example, masking in indoor settings irrespective of vaccination status) and adherence to prevention strategies (for example, surveillance testing and infection prevention and control procedures) are prudent in areas with a high circulation of the delta variant and in higher-risk settings, such as residential care facilities.

ref: de Puig H, Lee R.A., Najjar D, et al. Minimally instrumented SHERLOCK (miSHERLOCK) for CRISPR-based point-of-care diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants. Science Advances 7(32) eabh2944 DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.abh2944.

Engineers at MIT and Harvard University have designed a small tabletop device that can detect SARS-CoV-2 from a saliva sample in about an hour. In a new study, they showed that the diagnostic is just as accurate as the PCR tests now used. The device can also be used to detect specific viral mutations linked to some of the SARS-CoV-2 variants that are now circulating. This result can also be obtained within an hour, potentially making it much easier to track different variants of the virus, especially in regions that don't have access to genetic sequencing facilities.

"We demonstrated that our platform can be programmed to detect new variants that emerge, and that we could repurpose it quite quickly," says James Collins, the Termeer professor of medical engineering and science in MIT's Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES) and Department of Biological Engineering. "In this study, we targeted the UK, South African, and Brazilian variants, but you could readily adapt the diagnostic platform to address the delta variant and other ones that are emerging."

The new diagnostic, which relies on CRISPR technology, can be assembled for about USD 15, but those costs could come down significantly if the devices were produced at a large scale, the researchers say. The new diagnostic is based on SHERLOCK, a CRISPR-based tool that Collins and others first reported in 2017. Components of the system include an RNA guide strand that allows detection of specific target RNA sequences, and Cas enzymes that cleave those sequences and produce a fluorescent signal. All of these molecular components can be freeze-dried for long-term storage and reactivated upon exposure to water.

The researchers designed the device, which they call minimally instrumented SHERLOCK (miSHERLOCK), so that it can have up to 4 modules that each look for a different target RNA sequence. The original module contains RNA guide strands that detect any strain of SARS-CoV-2. Other modules are specific to mutations associated with some of the variants that have arisen in the past year, including B.1.1.7, P.1, and B.1.351.

[Along with vaccination, an inexpensive rapid diagnosis could be a game-changer. This assay currently costs USD 15 per test, which is too high and takes 1 hour to give a result, which would ideally be shorter. But the test uses a saliva sample that is easily collected and allows individuals to test themselves for multiple variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus at home. The results can be read and verified by an accompanying smartphone app.

"miSHERLOCK eliminates the need to transport patient samples to a centralized testing location and greatly simplifies the sample preparation steps, giving patients and doctors a faster, more accurate picture of individual and community health, which is critical during an evolving pandemic," said co-first author Helena de Puig, a postdoctoral fellow at the Wyss Institute and MIT.

More about the new device can be found at https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/08/new-at-home-test-detects-covid-19-variants-in-your-spit/. It currently does not test for the delta variant, but that should be easily incorporated into the assay, as can any new variant of concern.

A previous publication reported a similar rapid test (Bo Ning, Tao Yu, Shengwei Zhang, et al. A smartphone-read ultrasensitive and quantitative saliva test for COVID-19. Science Advances. Vol. 7, no. 2, eabe3703 . DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.abe3703. 8 Jan 2021). According to Haartz, Israel is starting to use rapid testing at events.

[In the past 24 hours, 15 countries including the USA (24 390), Iran (39 619), India (36 035), UK (27 335), Indonesia (26 415), Russia (22 866), Turkey (22 699), France (20 450), Mexico (20 018), Thailand (19 983), Malaysia (18 688), Japan (15 796), Brazil (13 893), Spain (13 213), and Bangladesh (10 299) have reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 7726 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 6 Aug 2021 to late 7 Aug 2021). A total of 48 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 20 of the 48 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, and 4 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 3.3 %, while daily reported deaths have increased by 2.4 %. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 41.3 % increase in daily reported cases and a 57.4 % increase in reported deaths.

Impression: Worldwide over 450 000 newly confirmed infections were reported in the past 24 hours; there are over 203.44 million cumulative reported cases and over 4.30 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
