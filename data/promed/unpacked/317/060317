MECHANICAL TRANSMISSION BY MOSQUITOES (2)
=========================================
March 7, 1996
A study conducted in Florida indicates that HIV is not transmitted by
mosquitoes. Mosquitoes were collected in an area with relatively high
incidence of HIV infection and were tested for the presence of virus
by standard virus isolation techniques and PCR analysis.
