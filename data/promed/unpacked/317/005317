Flavescence doree was detected for the 1st time in the Department of Puy-de-Dome, Region of Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes. It had previously been reported from other Departments in that Region.

Currently, the Regional Directorate of Food, Agriculture and Forestry are preparing a directive to industry on control measures and the outline of the area to be put under quarantine restrictions. Measures to be taken will include surveillance, insecticide sprays and uprooting of affected vines.

[Flavescence doree (FD) is one of the most important and destructive diseases of grapevines due to its fast rate of spread within vineyards. The disease was 1st reported in 1954 in southern France and has been spreading in southern Europe. FD was thought to have been introduced from the United States, the home of its vector. It is caused by a phytoplasma (_Candidatus_ Phytoplasma vitis) belonging to the 16SrV (elm yellows) group.

Symptoms can vary on different grape varieties and usually appear in late spring. They may include shortened internodes, stunting, leaves with downward rolled margins, as well as drooping shoots. Leaves turn yellow in white grape cultivars and red in red ones. Leaf necrosis and bark splitting may also develop; yield is severely reduced and some vines die, usually in the year following infection. The survivors continue to harbour the pathogen but appear symptomless (latent infections) unless they are re-infected.

FD is spread by the vine leafhopper _Scaphoideus titanus_ and through infected propagation material. Symptomless budwood can carry both eggs of the vector and the pathogen. Reliable diagnosis in both symptomatic and asymptomatic host tissue by molecular methods is vital for disease management, which may include pathogen exclusion, certification of clean propagation material, and removal of infected plants (pathogen reservoirs). Insecticides can reduce vector numbers. The phytoplasma may be eliminated by treating dormant canes with hot water (heat therapy).

In Europe, a northward spread of the disease is being observed, as in the item above. The 1st report of FD north of the Alps was from Germany in 2014 (ProMED-mail post 20141217.3038025). Recently, it was detected in eastern Switzerland (ProMED-mail post 20170320.4914128), despite strict quarantine measures in that country. FD was also reported from Austria (see link below) in grapevines and ornamental clematis. Until then, the only known natural hosts were _Vitis vinifera_ and hybrids, as well as some wild _Vitis_ species as asymptomatic infections. The pathogen was included in the A2 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

The presence of FD in central Europe now may pose a risk of the disease and/or possibly the vector spreading in the region as another example of "warm climate diseases" getting established in cooler regions due to climate change (see, for example, Esca disease of grapevine, ProMED-mail post 20141024.2895414).
