[1] Madagascar (Fianarantsoa)
Date: Sun 28 Feb 2010
From: Jean-Michel Heraud <jmheraud@pasteur.mg> [edited]


On 10 Feb [2010], after observing an increase in the number of
dengue-like syndromes at the primary health care in Mananjary
(Vatovavy-Fitovinany) [Fianarantsoa province], the health district
medical officer shipped 11 specimens to the National Reference
Laboratory (NRL) at the Institut Pasteur from Madagascar for
arboviruses analysis.

On 11 Feb 2010, by RT-PCR and after isolation on AP61 cell line,
viral RNA from chikungunya virus (CHIKV) was detected in all
specimens. NRL sent an alert to the Ministry of Health (MoH).

A team composed of staff from MoH, WHO, and Institut Pasteur from
Madagascar (epidemiologist and entomologist) went to Mananjary for
investigation. Specimens from 91 outpatients with dengue-like
syndromes were collected as well as larvae of mosquitoes.

As of 24 Feb [2010], NRL detected CHIKV in 95 out of 102 sera. Health
authorities said that the total number of suspected cases is 1507
representing 58 percent of total consultant [patients]. 4 other
cities close to Mananjary had confirmed and suspected cases. Health
authorities and technical partners are following closely the
situation in affected district but also in neighboring districts.

[Dr Heraud's information concerning the chikungunya outbreak directly
from the field in Madagascar and providing laboratory confirmations
of chikungunya virus infection is most welcome. One hopes that the
case and vector surveillance and mosquito control can slow this outbreak.

Vatovavy-Fitovinany, in Fianarantsoa province, is the Southeast
region of Madagascar. A map showing its location can be accessed at

A mosquito-borne virus with symptoms similar to dengue fever is
spreading rapidly in Burma [Myanmar], according to doctors who
asserted however that it has a low fatality rate.

The chikungunya virus only became commonplace in Burma [Myanmar] in
mid-2009, although cases were reported as far back as 1975. It comes
as doctors warn of a new wave of the A (H1N1) and A (H5N1) viruses in
Burma [Myanmar] that have struck more than 60 people in the past fortnight.

"(Chikungunya) [disease] begins like a normal flu with symptoms such
as aches and pains, especially in the joints," [said] a specialist
doctor in Rangoon. "The joint pain can be so severe that elderly
patients may be unable to walk." Although the flu has strong
symptoms, it has low fatality rate, particularly if the patient
receives proper treatment at inception, the doctor said. "Personal
hygiene is important for flu diseases. Wash hands properly and avoid
getting bitten by mosquitoes. Chikungunya [virus] is mainly
contracted [transmitted] by mosquitoes," he said.

[Chikungunya virus is endemic in Southeast Asia, including Burma
(Myanmar). It would be of interest to know if these cases have been
laboratory confirmed.
