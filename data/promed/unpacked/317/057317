[With the addition of the above 10 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, and the 7 newly reported deaths in individuals previously reported as MERS-CoV infected, there have now been 473 cases of MERS-CoV infection including 133 deaths reported by Saudi Arabia since September 2012.

Notable in today's report is that 7 of the 10 newly reported infected individuals had a history of contact with previously diagnosed MERS-CoV infected individuals -- 5 of these 7 contact cases are presently asymptomatic and 2 are reportedly in stable condition. One of the cases is a pregnant female, the only case in today's report that is in the intensive care unit. 9 of the 10 cases are in the 25-44 year old age group, a younger age group, and while none were reported to have comorbidities, one of these cases was mentioned to have been hospitalized since 18 Feb 2014, suggesting another health issue was ongoing, with exposure to the MERS-CoV occurring in the healthcare setting.

An Arabic language report from the Saudi State media mentioned the death of the 25-year-old male from Qurrayat who had sought medical care in Zarka, Jordan after being hospitalized in Saudi Arabia (see http://sabq.org/69Zfde for the original report, in Arabic). One suspects the 25-year-old mentioned in the above report as a previously reported confirmed case who died.

Lebanon records its 1st case of MERS virus
------------------------------------------
Lebanon has recorded its 1st case of the often-fatal Middle East respiratory virus, the Health Ministry said on Friday [9 May 2014].

The virus was detected on Thursday [8 May 2014] in a man who had checked into a local hospital after feeling ill, the ministry said. It said the case was not severe, and the man has since been discharged.

A ministry official said the patient had recently returned from a visit to several Gulf countries, including Saudi Arabia.

The kingdom has been the focal point of the outbreak of the virus, known as the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).

MERS belongs to a family of viruses that include both the common cold and SARS, which killed some 800 people in a global outbreak in 2003. It can cause symptoms that include fever, breathing problems, pneumonia and kidney failure.

Not everyone who contracts the virus that causes MERS gets sick, while others show only mild symptoms. There is no cure or vaccine.

Still, the threat from the virus has prompted health officials around the region to adopt protective measures to try to prevent the spread of the disease.

In Lebanon, the health minister on Thursday [8 May 2014] ordered that thermal cameras be set up at Beirut's international airport to check arriving passengers for possible signs of fever, indicating a possible MERS infection.

[3] Saudi Arabia, WHO mission summary 7 May 2014

WHO concludes MERS-CoV mission in Saudi Arabia
----------------------------------------------
A team of experts from the World Health Organization (WHO) completed a 5-day mission to Saudi Arabia to assist the national health authorities to assess the recent increase in the number of people infected by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Jeddah.

As of [3 May 2014], 489 cases, including 126 deaths, were reported to WHO globally and 406 cases, including 101 deaths, from Saudi Arabia. These numbers can change from one day to the next according to when Member States inform WHO.

The team looked into the epidemiological, disease prevention, organizational and communication aspects of this recent outbreak to understand the public health risk and transmission chain and to propose next steps and actions.

After meeting health officials in the capital, WHO experts visited 2 main hospitals in Jeddah to analyse transmission patterns and review infection control measures.

Key findings of the Jeddah outbreak include the following:
- Current evidence does not suggest that a recent increase in numbers reflects a significant change in the transmissibility of the virus. The upsurge in cases can be explained by an increase, possibly seasonal, in the number of primary cases amplified by several outbreaks in hospitals due to breaches in WHO's recommended infection prevention and control measures. There is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community and the transmission pattern overall remained unchanged.

- The majority of human-to-human infections occurred in health care facilities. One quarter of all cases have been health care workers.

- There is a clear need to improve health care workers' knowledge and attitudes about the disease and systematically apply WHO's recommended infection prevention and control measures in health care facilities.

- The reasons for the increase in the number of primary community cases, as well as the infection route, remain unknown. Three quarters of all primary community cases have been male, the majority of whom have been over 50 years old. Secondary transmission in the community and households is much lower than in health care settings.

- Some confirmed cases presented with mild or no symptoms.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections and to carefully review unusual patterns.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions, including for upcoming pilgrimage travel to Saudi Arabia.

[According to the above WHO report, as of 3 May 2014 there were a total of 489 cases, including 126 deaths, due to MERS-CoV infection reported globally. If one adds the 67 additional cases and 32 additional deaths reported by Saudi Arabia since 3 May 2014, the 2 additional cases from Jordan, the 1 fatal case from Yemen, the 1 case from the USA and the case in Lebanon reported since then, it will bring the global total of MERS-CoV infections to 561 cases, including 159 deaths (see prior ProMED-mail posts on MERS-CoV listed below for more details on each of these reports).

We look forward to a more detailed analysis of the epidemiologic situation to date in Saudi Arabia following the review of the mission.

Of note is that WHO will hold another meeting of the IHR (International Health Regulations) Emergency Committee next week to discuss MERS-CoV (see below discussion). - Mod.MPP]

[4] WHO IHR Emergency Committee meeting

http://www.rappler.com/world/regions/middle-east/57667-who-emergency-talks-mers-virus


The World Health Organization (WHO) said Friday [9 May 2014] it would hold an emergency meeting next week on the deadly MERS virus, amid concern over the rising number of cases in several countries.

The United Nations health agency will host the emergency meeting on Tuesday [13 May 2014] to discuss the worrying spread of the virus, which in less than 2 years has killed 126 people in Saudi Arabia alone, spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told reporters in Geneva.

The WHO's emergency committee has already met 4 times to discuss the mysterious coronavirus, which surfaced in mid-2012.

"The increase in the number of cases in different countries raises a number of questions," Jasarevic said, without giving further details of the aim of the new talks.

The WHO experts will brief reporters at the end of the teleconferenced meeting on Tuesday [13 May 2014] evening, he said.

The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is considered a deadlier but less-transmissible cousin of the SARS virus that broke out in Asia in 2003, infecting 8273 people and killing nearly 800 of them.

Like SARS, it appears to cause a lung infection, with patients suffering from a temperature, coughing, and breathing difficulties.

But it differs in that it also causes rapid kidney failure.

There are no vaccines or antiviral treatments for MERS, a disease that kills more than 40 percent of those infected and that experts are still struggling to understand.

According to the most recent WHO figures, 496 MERS cases have been detected since September 2012.

The Saudi health ministry says 463 of them have been in the Gulf nation.

MERS cases have also been reported in the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon, and even the United States, with most involving people who had travelled to Saudi Arabia or worked there, often as medical staff.

[Given the marked increase in confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infections since mid-March 2014, and the confirmation of MERS-CoV in individuals in countries outside of the Middle Eastern Region with a history of travel to the region, it is not surprising that a new meeting of the IHR emergency committee will be convened next week. We await the results of that meeting. - Mod.MPP]
