Wheat-Dependent Exercise-Induced Anaphylaxis Sensitized with Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein in Soap.

Abstract
Wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA) is a specific form of wheat allergy typically induced by exercise after ingestion of wheat products.

Wheat phi-5 gliadin is a major allergen associated with conventional WDEIA, and detection of serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) specific to recombinant phi-5 gliadin is a reliable method for its diagnosis.

Recently, an increased incidence of a new subtype of WDEIA, which is likely to be sensitized via a percutaneous and/or rhino-conjunctival route to hydrolyzed wheat protein (HWP), has been observed. All of the patients with this new subtype had used the same brand of soap, which contained HWP.

Approximately half of these patients developed contact allergy several months later and subsequently developed WDEIA. In each of these patients, contact allergy with soap exposure preceded food ingestion-induced reactions.

Other patients directly developed generalized symptoms upon ingestion of wheat products. The predominant observed symptom of the new WDEIA subtype was angioedema of the eyelids; a number of patients developed anaphylaxis.

This new subtype of WDEIA has little serum phi-5 gliadin-specific serum IgE.

Conclusions
We experienced an outbreak of wheat allergy with systemic symptoms, which may be due to percutaneous and/or a rhino-conjunctival sensitization following the use of cosmetics. Such an event was almost completely unknown by health care professionals until recently.

Thus, there is limited information regarding the clinical course. The serum IgE levels of many HWP-WDEIA patients against wheat and gluten decreased after the cessation of HWP-containing soap usage. In some patients, serum IgE against these antigens had disappeared. A remission case of HWPWDEIA has been reported 39 and we also experienced some patients who had remission of WDEIA symptoms (unpublished observation).

However, many patients with HWP-WDEIA have not recovered from WDEIA-related symptoms. Large-scale studies are needed to clarify the prognosis of HWP-WDEIA patients.

It is very unusual for an allergy to develop on the first exposure, as noted in the comment after the first article.

It seems unusual for a soap to trigger such severe reactions in people. Most soaps trigger such things as skin rashes, but unconsciousness, falling, and respiratory conditions is severe and rather unusual. In 2010 the International Institute for Quality Selections awarded this company the High International Trophy in the Cosmetic Products & Toiletries Selection for this product (see http://www.monde-selection.com/en/7.4.4.7_PE_Selection_Results_2010.asp).

While many allergies can be serious, such as inhaled or consumed allergens to peanuts. But for such severe allergies to be triggered on contact, or perhaps from smelling the soap is unusual and I wonder what other ingredients are in this soap. - Mod.TG
