A contagious virus has been confirmed in over 20 rabbits found in 10 counties -- including Offaly, a government minister has confirmed. Green Party TD [Teachta Dála; member of the Dáil or lower house of Parliament], Catherine Martin, asked the minister for culture, heritage and the Gaeltacht [Irish-speaking regions] about areas impacted by the RHD2 virus.

Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) was first reported in domestic (farmed) rabbits in China in 1984, killing 4 million animals within one year of its discovery. By 1986 this viral disease had been found in continental Europe and has since spread globally leading to significant mortality in wild populations of rabbits. In 2010, a new more virulent strain of this virus (RHD2) emerged in France. It causes death within a few days of infection with sick animals having swollen eyelids, partial paralysis, and bleeding from the eyes and mouth.

RHD was first detected in domestic rabbits in Ireland in 2018. This summer [2019] it was confirmed in wild rabbits in Clare and Wicklow and the 1st case in a wild hare has been confirmed in Wexford.

RHD and RHD2 pose no risk to humans.

In response to the Parliamentary Question by Deputy Martin, Minister Josepha Madigan said: "Since the initial reports of the RHD2 virus in August 2019, RHD2 has been confirmed in 5 hares found in Dublin and Wexford and in 21 rabbits found in counties Carlow, Clare, Cork, Kildare, Leitrim, Meath, Offaly, Tipperary, Wexford, and Wicklow.

"In relation to hare coursing, I recently issued revised licences to allow the netting and tagging of hares but there are specific restrictions and conditions explicitly attached to the issue of those licences. The capturing of hares and coursing activity is prohibited in areas within a 25-kilometre [about 15.5 mi] radius of where wild rabbits or hares had tested positive for the virus. New zones will be added on an ongoing basis if further positive tests arise and, in these new zones, the capturing of hares will have to cease immediately and coursing will only be possible with already captured hares, where the hares are certified in writing by a veterinary surgeon as being healthy, and such hares will only be released on foot of further such certification."

[In the 1980s, European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) populations were devastated by a virus that caused an extremely lethal and highly contagious disease, rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD). The 1st outbreak of this new disease was reported in 1984 in the Jiangsu Province of China within a group of commercially-bred Angora rabbits imported from Germany. As the virus spread worldwide, naturally occurring RHD outbreaks were reported in geographically distant regions, such as Cuba, Uruguay, and Reunion Island.

RHD is a highly virulent lagovirus endemic in Europe and Australasian populations of the European rabbit, _O. cuniculus_. It has also caused several unexplained disease outbreaks in domestic European rabbits in North America.

RHD is characterised by high morbidity and high mortality (70-90%), and spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival or oral routes.

Transmission of RHD is facilitated by the high stability of the virus in the environment. Lesions are primary liver necrosis and a massive disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in all organs and tissues. The most severe lesions are in the liver, trachea and lungs.

RHD-2 is a variant form of the original RHD-1 virus and differs in the following ways:
- rabbits infected with the RHD-2 virus typically DO NOT show the symptoms that are common with RHD-1 infection so it is far more difficult to diagnose from simple observations;
- death from RHD-2 occur later and over a longer period of time than RHD-1: typically this is 3-9 days following infection and can last up to 5 days, instead of 2-6 days infection and lasting 3-4 days as generally observed with classical RHD-1. Although this is marginal it is important to note from a quarantine perspective;
- only following post-mortem examination will initial diagnosis be possible, however further tests are required to definitively confirm RHD-2 which is now recommended for unexplained deaths;
- in mainland Europe, RHD-2 is now very common particularly in France where it was first identified in 2010 and spread country-wide where it was mainly transmitted through the wild rabbit population with cross-over with domestic rabbits. In Italy it has not spread very wide given the differences in wild rabbit population density. A research study has been published that describes the proliferation in RHD-2 in France since 2010 and of relevance to the current situation in the Great Britain and Ireland.

RHD-2 is a genetically and antigenically different from RHD-1, and the immunogenic differences occur at the serotype level, for which vaccination against both variants is needed.

These viruses, which have been circulating in pet rabbits, have now reached wild populations in Ireland. The impact of this pathogen in these populations is a concern for the conservation of wild rabbits. Continued surveillance should be implemented to assess this impact.
