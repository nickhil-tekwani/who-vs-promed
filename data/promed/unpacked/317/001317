[1] Cholera - Congo DR (North Kivu Province)

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has reported a sharp increase in the number of cholera cases in the armed conflict area of North Kivu. According to the report, 368 new cases were reported from epidemiological week 24 (11-17 Jun 2012) to epidemiological week 26 (25 Jun - 1 Jul 2012). The most affected areas include Birambizo, Goma, Karisimbi, Kiroshe, Mutwanga, Mweso and Rwanguba.

There is concern that the security situation may increase difficulty in accessing the health care facilities and could increase the number of severe and fatal cases. The current armed conflict in North Kivu also poses a risk of international spread of the disease to neighbouring countries such as Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan and Uganda.

North Kivu is one the 5 provinces of eastern DRC where cholera is endemic. _Vibrio cholerae_ was confirmed in the AMI-Kivu laboratory since 2011.

Epidemiological investigation conducted by national authorities and other partners, including Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), Merlin, and International Rescue Committee (IRC) indicated that insufficient access to safe water supply remains the main cause of the epidemic in North Kivu.

Patients are being treated with infusions and antibiotics as appropriate at treatment centres. Interventions to control the epidemic that are being carried out include education and communication; management of cases; increased surveillance; hygiene and sanitation; and provision of safe drinking water.

The World Health Organization (WHO) is working to support national authorities in response to the cholera outbreak and the broader humanitarian emergency resulting from conflict and population displacement.

[2] Cholera - Sierra Leone, Guinea

Sierra Leone's health ministry on Wed 18 Jul 2012 said an outbreak of cholera in the west African country has killed 62 people in less than a month. The western area, including the capital Freetown, and "3 towns in the northern and southern parts of the country have now been declared cholera outbreak areas," said a ministry statement.

Between 23 Jun 2012 and 17 Jul 2012, 62 people have died and 3721 cases have been reported in the areas concerned, statistics showed. The highest number of cases was in the town of Port Loko, where 21 children under the age of 5 have died.

"The outbreak has been traced to unsanitary conditions, acute water shortages in many parts of the country and migration from affected regions," a health official said.

A recent report by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said the disease had also spread to neighboring Guinea.

As the annual rainy season is getting underway, the waterborne disease has already left some 700 people dead in West and Central Africa with more than 29 000 cases reported, UNICEF said last week. Mali and Niger have also been hard hit, with high levels of malnourishment as a result of a food crisis exacerbating the problem.

[3] Cholera - Mali (North)

UNICEF is sending 20 000 water, sanitation and hygiene kits to the North of Mali as part of its emergency response to a cholera outbreak. Some 120 000 people, including 60 000 children, will benefit from the supplies that include purification tablets, storage containers and other equipment dispatched to Gao and Timbuktu in the north. Local partners will distribute the supplies.

Since the start of the cholera outbreak about 10 days ago, 6 children have died among 56 cases reported in Wabaria, Labbezanga and Ansongo in Gao region on the banks of the Niger River.

Though cholera is endemic in the countries of the Sahel, the crisis in northern Mali combined with the massive displacement of people and the onset of the rainy season are raising fears of a sharp increase in cholera cases in the coming weeks.

"We must do everything we can to prevent the further spread of cholera in northern Mali," said Frederic Sizaret, the Deputy Representative of UNICEF in Mali.

When the outbreak was 1st reported, UNICEF sent 3 trucks loaded with medicine and equipment to help partners in Gao respond. Cholera prevention for 500 000 people is under way in high-risk areas. Distribution of kits is accompanied by sessions to explain how to treat water and encourage better hygiene. Each of the 20 000 kits, which will be distributed this week, contain collapsible jerry cans and buckets and a 6-month supply of soap and water purification tablets for a family of 6.

"The cholera epidemic on top of the nutrition and security crises currently faced by Mali increase people's vulnerability and risks, endangering current emergency response efforts. We urgently need more funding to respond," Mr. Sizaret said.

A cholera epidemic in Niger has killed 58 people and spread to a refugee camp housing Malians who have fled the unrest in the north of their country, the UN said on Thu 19 Jul 2012.

"The overall number of cases reported as of 15 Jul 2012 is 2900, with 58 deaths," the UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a report issued from Niger's capital Niamey.

"The number of cholera cases continues to increase [and] the ... situation remains worrying with the arrival of the rainy season," it added.

The epidemic broke out in January 2012 in the western region of Tillaberi. Its spread to the Tabareybarey refugee camp, where the WHO has registered 9 cases, is particularly worrying for health officials. The contagious intestinal illness can decimate refugee camps.

Some 250 000 Malians have fled to neighbouring countries, including 52 000 to Niger, according to the UN refugee agency.

Even as a 60-year-old woman died of suspected cholera, a Chennai Corporation press release said 18 people were being treated at Kilpauk Medical College (KMC) and 7 others at Communicable Diseases Hospital (CDH) with diarrhea.

But data sourced by TOI from KMC revealed that since Wed 18 Jul 2012, 60 people were admitted to KMC with complaints of loose stools, vomiting and dehydration. The hospital sent 10 people including 4 children to CDH. "Of the 4 children, one has tested positive for cholera in a level one test; 3 others were clinically diagnosed as cases of suspected cholera," said KMC dean Dr P Ramakrishnan, who added that there is no reason for panic. The hospital has been receiving several patients from Chetpet, Ayanavaram and Perambur with symptoms of diarrhea. "We have referred 10 suspected cholera cases to CDH. We have asked Chennai Corporation and Metrowater for further action."

[9] Diarrhea - Nepal (Nuwakot District)
Date: Fri 20 Jul 2012

http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?headline=Dead+meat+behind+diarrhoea+outbreak+&NewsID=340361


The cause of last Tuesday's [17 Jul 2012] diarrhea outbreak in Shikharbesi VDC-4, 7, 8 and 9, with 200 persons taken ill, was believed to be the consumption of cattle meat from a dead cow, said a health worker.

According to a local health volunteer, Sirmendo Tamang, the villagers developed diarrhea in large numbers after they feasted on a dead buffalo's meat at the house of local Kanchho Tamang in Shikharbesi-9 about a week ago.

"Despite my advice, they consumed the meat and began falling sick," Tamang said. Over 200 persons have been taken ill due to the diarrhea outbreak in Shikharbesi VDC-4, 7, 8 and 9 since Tue 17 Jul 2012.

The outbreak came under control by Fri 20 Jul 2012 after a joint team of health workers from the district hospital supported by different local health facilities set up a health camp in the village and began treating the patients.

[The etiology of this outbreak of diarrheal illness is unclear and could, indeed, be related to eating something else or drinking something rather than the dead buffalo.
