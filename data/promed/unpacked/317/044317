An _E. coli_ outbreak believed to be responsible for at least 36 infections and a death in the Edmonton area has been traced to pork products sold by a meat packing and retail operation in central Alberta. The Meat Shop at Pine Haven, located on a Hutterite colony southeast of Wetaskiwin, announced [Wed 25 Apr 2018], it had temporarily shut down and issued a voluntary recall of a number of its raw and ready-to-eat pork products.

A full list of the recalled items, including ground pork, chops, sausages, bacon and salami, was available on the Canadian Food Inspection Agency website. The products in question were sold or distributed by the shop between [19 Feb 2018] and [24 Apr 2018], and included pork served by Mama Nita's Binalot restaurant where the outbreak was 1st identified. "This is our businesses, it's our livelihood and the food safety of our products to consumers is the highest priority," facility manager Tim Hofer said. "It's a very difficult time for us, but we are doing the best we absolutely can to identify the problem, and once we have found it, to mitigate the risks."

All 36 patients sickened by _E. coli_ O157:H7 have been linked in one way or another to meat from the shop, said Dr. Jasmine Hasselback, medical officer of health, Edmonton zone, for Alberta Health Services. Hasselback said tracing the bug's origins proved to be complex and time-consuming, requiring nearly a month of detective work by public health officials.

The initial cluster of 5 infections was discovered in late March [2018] among patrons of the restaurant, but investigators were hampered by the fact the establishment used different meat suppliers. As well, it appeared not all of the infected patients had eaten pork. "When you are looking at foods people ate at the restaurant, there actually wasn't a consistent pattern at that time," Hasselback said. "It wasn't until we were able to start adding information regarding the individuals who were not linked to the restaurant that pork was able to come a little bit clearer."

Of the 36 patients identified to date, 21 are believed to have acquired their infection at Mama Nita's, including several staff. The remaining 15 cases, including the deceased patient, have no connection to the restaurant.

Hasselback said those additional cases gave public health staff more information to work with, but also more variables to consider.
She said investigations of food-borne outbreaks tend to rely on 3 major avenues of inquiry. These include interviews with patients to explore what they have eaten and where they have traveled, and lab tests to link the cases of _E. coli_ 0157:H7. Investigators also gather samples of food that are possibly suspect and have those tested in a lab.

Hofer said his meat facility has supplied products to "dozens" of customers in the Edmonton area - including Mama Nita's - though he didn't have an exact number. He said the business was informed last [Wed 25 Apr 2018] of a potential connection to the outbreak. When managers learned swabs of certain products had tested positive, along with one swab of the facility itself, the operation was shut down. "The 1st thing we did was a deep clean of the facility, from ceiling to everything, all scrubbed and sanitized," Hofer said, adding that a thorough review of the facility's procedures has begun.

[Although pork is not generally considered as a major reservoir for EHEC, _E. coli_ O157:H7 has been reported to be prevalent globally at varying rates in swine, that infected swine might shed the bacteria for 2 months, and that horizontal transmission between swine and other livestock species might occur (Tseng M, Fratamico PM, Manning SD and Funk JA: Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli in swine: the public health perspective. Anim Health Res Rev 2014;15:63-75).

A large outbreak of pork-associated EHEC infection occurred in 2014, also in Alberta, Canada:

Abstract
--------
"During July-October 2014, an outbreak of 119 _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 infections in Alberta, Canada was identified through notifiable disease surveillance and investigated by local, provincial, and federal public health and food regulatory agencies. A total of 23 (19 percent) patients were hospitalized, 6 of whom developed hemolytic uremic syndrome; no deaths were reported. Informed by case interviews, 7 potential food sources were identified and investigated. The majority of patients reported having consumed meals containing pork at Asian-style restaurants in multiple geographically diverse Alberta cities during their exposure period. Traceback investigations revealed a complex pork production and distribution chain entirely within Alberta. _E. coli_ O157:H7-contaminated pork and pork production environments and mishandling of pork products were identified at all key points in the chain, including slaughter, processor, retail, and restaurant facilities. An outbreak-specific pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) cluster pattern was found in clinical and pork _E. coli_ O157:H7 isolates. Measures to mitigate the risk for exposure and illness included pork product recalls, destruction of pork products, temporary food facility closures, targeted interventions to mitigate improper pork-handling practices identified at implicated food facilities, and prosecution of a food facility operator. Pork should be considered a potential source in _E. coli_ O157:H7 investigations and prevention messaging, and pork handling and cooking practices should be carefully assessed during regulatory food facility inspections."
