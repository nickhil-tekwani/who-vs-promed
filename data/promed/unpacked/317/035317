_Vibrio vulnificans_ are rare in Swedish coastal waters. The summer 1994
was the first time the bacterium was observed, then an elderly woman
developed what was thought as an atypical erysipelas after a sea bath. One
little sore on one foot caused fever, general feeling of sickness and a big
blush of erysipelas-looking [lesion] on the lower part of the leg. Blood
cultivation showed _V. vulnificans_.
The bacterium has not been observed earlier in Sweden. This is probably
because it needs at least 17C in the seawater for the bacteria to grow, a
temperature which is seldom reached in coastal waters in Sweden.
Since 1994 there have been unusually hot summers and every summer there
have been a few cases of _V. vulnificans_ in southern of Sweden. This year
the first death occurred.
All the known cases have shown sore infections with bulbous changes in the
skin or atypical erysipelas. Most cases have been people older than 60
[years of age] and their symptoms have initially been treated as
streptococcus or staphylococcus [infections]. Sepsis has preceded the
deaths. An elderly man got a bad infection, but managed that. Later he
died of complications. The second case was a patient with dialysis with an
erysipelas-looking [appearance] in the face.
The bacterium is highly virulent and will cause two clinical symptoms,
primary sepsis usually after intake of shellfish, or sore infections which
can cause sepsis. Sore infections can occur after sea bathing or handling
of shellfish and eel.
