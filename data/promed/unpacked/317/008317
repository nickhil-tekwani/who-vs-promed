Since the last update on 6 Dec 2016, 1173 new suspected cases of acute watery diarrhea/cholera and 3 additional deaths have been reported. As of 13 Dec 2016, a cumulative total of 10 148 suspected cases of cholera, including 92 associated deaths, have been reported across all affected governorates, with a case-fatality rate of 1%. The number of laboratory-confirmed cases of _Vibrio cholera_ 01 has risen to 156.

The affected areas include 135 districts in the governorates of Abyan, Aden, Al-Bayda'a, Al-Dhale'a, Al Hudaydah, Al Jawf, Amran, Dhamar, Hajjah, Ibb, Lahij, Raymah, Sana'a, Ta'izz as well as Sana'a City. However, over 65% of the reported cases were from Aden, Al-Bayda, Al Hudaydah and Ta'izz. About 70% of the reported deaths occurred in the governorates of Aden, Al Bayda'a, Al Hudaydah, Ibb and Ta'izz.

The cholera taskforce led by WHO, in partnership with the Ministry, UNICEF, OCHA and other partner organizations, continues to strengthen cholera response activities at the national and governorate levels. The prevention and intervention efforts taken so far have been effective in reducing the number of cases in some governorates, while new cases continue to be reported in others.

The taskforce continues to support the 26 cholera treatment centres and the 2 national health emergency control rooms in Aden and Sana'a. Rapid response teams have been deployed in the affected areas for effective and timely epidemiological investigation and response.

WHO has strengthened the capacity of local health workers through training on case management, infection control, water source chlorination and solid waste disposal and drainage network management.

Essential supplies such as rapid diagnostic test kits, IV fluids, oral rehydration solutions and water chlorination tablets have been provided in affected communities. WHO has also supported social mobilization and health education campaigns among citizens to raise their awareness on prevention of cholera and other diarrhoeal diseases.

Acute watery diarrheal diseases are endemic in Yemen; however, the ongoing conflict has stretched the capacity of the national health systems.

More than 7.6 million people and more than 3 million internally displaced persons currently live in areas affected by the outbreak.

[Poverty, flooding, drought, and war are the 4 horsemen of cholera. The conditions in the impoverished Arabian Peninsula country of Yemen are ideal for the rapid spread of _Vibrio cholerae_. Numbers are no doubt underreported and are likely to continue to rise dramatically in this country of more than 24 million inhabitants. Spread northward across the border to Saudi Arabia is likely as well as eastward to Oman.

Yemen is divided into 21 governorates (muhafazah), and they can be seen on a map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governorates_of_Yemen. - Mod.LL
