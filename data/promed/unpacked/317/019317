An Australian mosquito capable of transmitting viruses to humans and a major contributor to heartworm in dogs was discovered at homes in Monterey Park and Montebello [Los Angeles County], vector-control officials said Monday [15 Sep 2014]

It's not known if the discovery of the mosquito, formally known as _Aedes notoscriptus _ but referred to as "Aussie Mozzie," presents a public health risk. But because of its effect on dogs, it could be a major concern for pet owners.

The discovery is believed to be the 1st instance of the Aussie Mozzie being found in North America.

"This is one of the most widespread pest mosquitoes in Australia and, as well as being a nuisance-biting pest, has been implicated with mosquito-borne disease outbreaks in our cities," said Cameron Webb of the Marie Bashir Institute of Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity at the University of Sydney, Australia.

One mosquito was initially found in June [2014], but officials were not able to positively identify it. Another was found in August [2014] after a Montebello resident called authorities about the black-and-white striped pest.

Southland vector-control officials said they do not consider the discovery of the pest to be a "pressing threat." The mosquitoes prefer to lay their eggs in smaller containers of water and they bite most aggressively in the afternoons and evenings. The mosquitoes have been known to transfer viruses such as Barmah Forest and Ross River to humans [in Australia].

Local authorities said they believe the more pressing threat locally is the Asian tiger mosquito [_Ae. albopictus_], which has been the target of eradication efforts that began in 2011. That mosquito can transmit diseases [viruses] such as dengue and chikungunya, although there have been no records of such viruses being transmitted locally.

[One hopes that the eradication efforts to eliminate _Aedes notoscriptus_ are successful. In addition to being a pest species, it is both a heartworm and a virus vector in Australia. In laboratory tests to determine the susceptibility of this species to chikungunya virus [CHIKV], the infectious dose required to infect 50 per cent of the mosquitoes was 10(2.6) CCID(50) [cell culture infectious doses]/mosquito. When exposed to blood meals containing between 10(3.5) and 10(4.1) CCID(50)/mosquito of CHIKV, infection rates in this species was 81 per cent or higher. The subsequent transmission rate was 20 per cent. Chikungunya virus has been imported in California in 24 individuals this year (2014) (http://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/geo/united-states.html), so should _Ae. notoscriptus_ become established, it raises the risk of ongoing, local transmission of CHIKV. Interestingly, another invasive mosquito, _Ae. aegypti_ has been found in this same area. It appears that _Aedes aegypti_ is spreading in California and has been found in 3 counties.
