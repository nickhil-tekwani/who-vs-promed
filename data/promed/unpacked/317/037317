Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- update 23 Jul 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------------
On [12 Jul 2014], the National IHR Focal Point of the Islamic Republic of Iran reported to WHO an additional laboratory-confirmed case of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

The patient is a 67 year old woman from Kerman Province. The patient had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and was admitted to a hospital on [6 Jun 2014] due to a COPD exacerbation. The patient was discharged on [14 Jun 2014] and continued treatment at home. She was in a stable condition until she developed severe acute respiratory symptoms and was readmitted to a hospital on [25 Jun 2014]. The patient was laboratory-confirmed with MERS-CoV on [5 Jul 2014] and died on the same day. The patient had no history of travel and no known history of contact with animals or consumption of raw camel milk products in the 14 days prior to becoming ill. The patient did not have known contact with a previously reported MERS-CoV case. However, during her 1st hospitalisation, the patient had close contact with another patient with severe acute respiratory infection.

Investigation of contacts in the health care facility and family of the case is ongoing.

In addition, Saudi Arabia reported 3 deaths among previously reported MERS-CoV cases.

Globally, 837 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 291 related deaths, have officially been reported to WHO.

WHO advice
----------
Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all member states to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.

Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and those with impaired immunity are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.

Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

What's going on in Iran's Kerman Province?
------------------------------------------
If you have been following developments in the outbreak of MERS -- Middle East respiratory syndrome -- you probably think of Saudi Arabia when the topic of the new virus comes up. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia [KSA] has diagnosed far more cases of the disease than any other affected country, 721 to date. ([297] of those cases have been fatal.)

But the huge surge of cases that KSA experienced between March and June [2014] appears to be subsiding. For the 1st time in months, the Saudis have gone 2 straight weeks without reporting a new case.

While that's good news, there are some concerning developments across the Persian Gulf. In Iran's Kerman Province, to be specific. If you look at a Google map of the Middle East, the peninsula that is Dubai points across the Gulf towards Kerman Province. (If you follow that link, Kerman's borders are outlined in pink.)

Since mid-May [2014] there have been 5 confirmed MERS cases in the south central Iranian province, the 1st reported in the country since the virus 1st emerged in 2012. That's not a huge number. Still, there are worrisome features about these cases.

For starters, none of the people who've tested positive for MERS travelled outside the country in the lead-up to their infection. That means they caught the virus in Iran. Up till now, Iran hasn't been seen as a place where MERS can be contracted.

What is considered most likely is that these people were infected by someone who had been to one of the countries where MERS cases are seen, places like Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates or Jordan. And at least 4 of the cases can be linked to 2 people who had recently returned from religious pilgrimages to Mecca.

In one instance, 2 sisters -- Iran's 1st declared cases -- reportedly had contact with a female pilgrim who had returned with a flu-like illness. Later, a female nursing assistant who treated one of the sisters was diagnosed with MERS.

Then in a seemingly separate event, a male health care worker was diagnosed with MERS. He had no known contact with confirmed MERS cases, but he did help care for a man who returned from performing a pilgrimage in the 1st half of May [2014]. The male pilgrim was admitted to hospital [17 May 2014] with a severe respiratory illness. The pilgrim, who died, tested negative for MERS. But experts know false negatives can be a problem with MERS. If doctors swab a patient's nostril when the virus is already deep in the lungs, they can get a false result. This man's negative test, then, can't be taken as a guarantee he didn't have MERS.

Did the 2 pilgrims know one another? Were they part of the same travel group? Or did Iran see 2 independent importations of MERS in the same province within a period of a couple of weeks? Answers to those questions aren't currently available.

And this week there was news of a 5th confirmed case, in a 67 year old woman who suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a debilitating lung condition. In early June [2014], she spent 8 days in hospital. While there, she was in contact with a patient who was suffering from a severe respiratory infection. The woman was sent home on [14 Jun 2014], but was readmitted to hospital on [25 Jun 2014]. On [5 Jul 2014] she tested positive for MERS and died that same day.

Like the other confirmed cases, she had not travelled outside of Iran. So how did she get infected? Was it the patient with the respiratory illness? If that person had MERS, how did he or she catch it? Was he or she tested? If not, why not?

There are far more questions than answers at this point and WHO is asking them of health authorities in Iran.

Kerman Province is large and it's not clear if all these infections have taken place in the same part of the province. If they all happened at the same hospital, the events might suggest the facility had an outbreak it hadn't detected. As was seen in Toronto [Ontario Province, Canada] during the 2003 SARS outbreak, unrecognized cases can spread disease through a facility; finding the links between cases can be a real challenge. But until health officials find and isolate all cases in an outbreak, they can't prevent onward transmission.

It's important, therefore, to find out what is happening in Kerman Province. Perhaps there was limited spread that has since died out. After all, the most recent confirmed case, the 67 year old woman, was probably infected in the 1st half of June [2014]. But until authorities figure out how these patients contracted the virus, they cannot be sure there aren't other infected people who haven't yet been detected. If there is ongoing transmission of MERS in Kerman Province, even at low levels, that spread needs to be found and stopped.

I've put together a timeline of the Iranian MERS cases. You can see it here: http://www.dipity.com/HelenBranswell/MERS-in-Irans-Kerman-Province/.

As of 26 Jul 2014 there have been:
Laboratory-confirmed cases: 721
Deaths: 297
Recovered cases: 394
Cases currently under treatment: 30

[The original post had a typo erroneously presenting the total number of laboratory confirmed cases as 712, the actual number was 721. - Mod.MPP]

During the period 19-26 Jul 2014 there have been 0 new cases, 0 deaths, and 2 recovered cases reported in Saudi Arabia.

[The good news in the above reports is that it is now 2 weeks since the last laboratory-confirmed case of MERS-CoV was identified in Saudi Arabia. In addition, there haven't been reports of MERS-CoV infection in individuals returning from their Umrah pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia during this month of Ramadan when there is usually an increase in individuals performing an Umrah pilgrimage. As Ramadan will be ending sun down tomorrow (27 Jul 2014), and the festive Id al-Fitr holiday period begins, there will be significant travel of people from Saudi Arabia returning to their homes following Umrah as well as Saudi nationals going on vacation elsewhere for the holiday season. As the current accepted range for incubation period for MERS is up to 14 days, we are still in a wait, watch and see mode vis a vis possible MERS-CoV activity.

That being said, the reports above on the MERS-CoV infection/fatality in Iran, and the very thoughtful discussion piece by Helen Branswell from the Canadian Press are definitely cause for concern. As mentioned in the media discussion piece, information on the hospitals where the confirmed MERS-CoV patients were cared for is not provided in any of the official reports. A web search on hospitals in Kerman Province revealed that the capital city (Kerman) is a major urban center and serves as a referral for healthcare for neighboring provinces as well, and there are several hospitals in the city. The disturbing pieces of information are the anecdotal reports of MERS-CoV confirmed cases having had contact with other individuals with respiratory illnesses that were not confirmed as MERS-CoV infected.

Reviewing the 5 confirmed cases, cases 1 and 2 had contact with a pilgrim returning from Saudi Arabia with an ILI (influenza-like illness). Case 3 was a health care worker (HCW) who had contact with case 1. Case 4, a HCW, had contact with a returning pilgrim from Saudi Arabia on 26 May 2014 who had SARI (severe acute respiratory illness), and case 5 was hospitalized for COPD 6-14 Jun 2014, during which time had contact with a patent with SARI. While the dates of hospitalizations do not overlap, if these all occurred in the same hospital(s), it is plausible that there have been 2 separate introductions of the MERS-CoV into Iran, both from undiagnosed MERS-CoV infected individuals returning from pilgrimages to Saudi Arabia in May and June, with subsequent transmission to friends/family and then to HCWs and other patients getting medical care in the potentially affected hospital(s).

More information on the contact tracing/evaluations of the above cases as well as investigations into other possible MERS-CoV infected cases.
