Update: Temporary Total Depletion of U.S. Licensed Yellow Fever Vaccine for Civilian Travelers Addressed by Investigational New Drug Use of Imported Stamaril Vaccine
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gershman MD, Sotir MJ.

Sanofi Pasteur, the manufacturer of the only yellow fever [YF] vaccine (YF-VAX) licensed in the United States, has announced that their stock of YF-VAX is totally depleted as of [Mon 24 Jul 2017]. YF-VAX for civilian use will be unavailable for ordering from Sanofi Pasteur until mid-2018, when their new manufacturing facility is expected to be completed. However, YF-VAX might be available at some clinics for several months, until remaining supplies at those sites are exhausted. In anticipation of this temporary total depletion, in 2016, Sanofi Pasteur submitted an expanded access investigational new drug application to the Food and Drug Administration to allow for importation and use of Stamaril. The Food and Drug Administration accepted Sanofi Pasteur's application in October 2016.

Manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur in France, Stamaril is not licensed in the United States, but is licensed and distributed in approximately 70 countries, and has comparable efficacy and safety to YF-VAX (1). During the interim period until YF-VAX is available again for use in the United States, Stamaril will be available in a limited number of designated clinics, selected to provide access to vaccine in US states and certain territories (1). Clinicians and travelers can find clinics offering Stamaril vaccine and those clinics that might have remaining doses of YF-VAX online at https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellow-fever-vaccination-clinics/search. Consideration will be given to adding more clinics if critical gaps in vaccine access are identified. CDC and Sanofi Pasteur continue to collaborate on contingency planning to address this situation.

Information about which countries require yellow fever vaccination for entry and for which countries CDC recommends yellow fever vaccination is available at https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/. Updates regarding yellow fever vaccine will be available on CDC's Travelers' Health website https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/ as well as Sanofi Pasteur's website http://www.sanofipasteur.us/vaccines/yellowfevervaccine

[The warning about the Sanofi Pasteur YF-VAX YF vaccine shortage was 1st issued many months ago, so its depletion in [Mon 24 Jul 2017] comes as no surprise. ProMED-mail posted an early warning on [Fri 28 Apr 2017] (see Yellow fever - Americas (42): USA vaccine Archive Number: 20170428.5002436), advising individuals who planned to travel to YF endemic areas to be vaccinated as early as possible while stocks of the vaccine were still available. This advice was repeated several times in posts of YF cases in South America. One hopes that these individuals acted on that advice. Those who plan trips to YF endemic areas in South America or Africa should consult the CDC and Sanofi Pasteur sites to determine where vaccine is available, remembering that the vaccine needs to be applied at least 10 days in advance of travel to be protective on arrival. - Mod.TY
