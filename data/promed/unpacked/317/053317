Angola: Marburg Haemorrhagic Fever Outbreak - WHO Update 9
---------------------------------------------------
As of Thu 7 Apr 2005, 205 cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever have been
reported in Angola. Of these, 180 have died. Zaire Province has reported
its first 6 cases, bringing the number of affected provinces to 7, all
concentrated in the northwestern part of the country.
Mobile surveillance teams in Uige were forced to suspend operations
yesterday when vehicles were attacked and damaged by local residents. As
the situation has not improved, no surveillance teams were operational
today in this province, which remains the epicentre of the outbreak. WHO
staff in Uige were notified today of several fatalities, but teams were
unable to investigate the cause of death or collect the bodies for safe
burial. Discussions have been held with provincial authorities to find
urgent solutions.
The dramatic symptoms and the frequent fatality of Marburg haemorrhagic
fever are resulting in a high level of fear, which is further aggravated by
a lack of public understanding of the disease. Moreover, because the
disease has no cure, hospitalization is not associated with a favourable
outcome, and confidence in the medical care system has been eroded. WHO is
familiar with such reactions, which have been seen during previous
outbreaks of the closely related Ebola haemorrhagic fever.
2 medical anthropologists are already in Uige and will be joined shortly by
experts in social mobilization from Angola, the Democratic Republic of
Congo, and Mozambique. Public compliance with control measures is not
expected to improve in the absence of intense campaigns to educate the
public about the disease.
In African countries, the single most important factor in controlling viral
haemorrhagic fevers is the engagement of affected communities as partners
in control. To achieve this engagement, local belief systems about the
causes of disease and traditional rituals for mourning the dead must be
respected. When the public understands and accepts a few simple messages --
avoid contact with blood and other fluids when caring for the ill, don't
touch bodies of the deceased -- transmission within the community can be
stopped and the outbreak brought under control.
Specialized international staff and equipment have been deployed rapidly
and measures are beginning to have an impact. Control of the outbreak will
require intensified and sustained technical support from multidisciplinary
teams, and additional materials and supplies. Provision of adequate
personal protective equipment is a particularly urgent need. Increased
field coordination of technical, operational and logistic support is
likewise needed. Today, WHO has launched an appeal, through the United
Nations, for funding to support the emergency response to this outbreak.
WHO needs US$2.4 million to support the Ministry of Health, Angola to
intensify ongoing operations in the field.
To reduce the risk of transmission in the community, priority activities
include intensive social mobilization and health education in the towns and
villages of Uige Province. To reduce the risk of transmission in
health-care facilities, priorities include the provision of personal
protective equipment for front-line staff and essential supplies for
infection control, including disinfectants. Additional activities that
urgently need to be strengthened include the early detection and isolation
of cases and the tracing and follow-up of contacts.

Angola: Suspected Fatal Case in Adjacent Region of the DRC Still Unconfirmed
-------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) on Fri 8 Apr 2005 called for stepping
up measures in Angola to halt the further spread of Marburg virus, which
has killed 174 people mainly in the north of the country. WHO said the 1st
case of the incurable disease had been found in Kuanza Sul, the 6th
province in the northwest to be hit, while a suspect death was also under
investigation in neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). There was
an unusually high death rate among the 200 cases identified since October
2004, mainly in the northern town of Uige, with an overwhelming number of
initial cases striking children under 5 years old, the WHO said in a statement.
"The situation right now in Angola is not under control yet...This is still
a health crisis at the national level and requires a profound commitment
both from national authorities and the international community in order to
contain this disease," Mike Ryan, director of WHO's alert and response
operations, told a news briefing. Some 50 international experts have been
deployed in Angola, where 27 years of civil war have left weakened health
systems and staff untrained for coping with a major epidemic, he said. By
isolating victims and tracing their contacts, officials were "breaking the
chain of transmission" in Uige, he said.
2 deaths from Marburg haemorrhagic fever have been confirmed in Luanda, the
teeming capital city of 4 million people, where 6 more cases are being
investigated, Ryan said. There was no evidence of transmission within
Luanda, where the 2 deaths have been a 15-year-old boy and a nurse, he
said. But Ryan noted the densely populated city saw "movement and exchange
of people between all areas of Angola", adding: "Therefore it is crucially
important that the surveillance systems and isolation units be fully
established in Luanda, both to maintain confidence in travel to Angola and
also to protect that population. That is ongoing."
Separately, the United Nations issued an emergency appeal to donors for
$3.5 million to combat the virus, one of the most virulent pathogens known,
over the next 3 months. The rare hemorrhagic fever is characterized by
headaches, nausea, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea. It is spread through
close contact with bodily fluids including blood, saliva, and semen. The
outbreak has surpassed the previous record of 123 deaths in a 1998-2000
epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
The hospital itself in Uige, a town of 500 000, may have contributed to
spreading the virus, according to Pierre Formenty, a WHO expert on
hemorrhagic fevers. "There is a possibility ... that the hospital served to
infect children who came to be treated there. It is not confirmed, but it
is a hypothesis," Formenty told reporters.
12 health-care workers were among the total 200 cases. Medical
anthropologists were enlisting tribal leaders to inform the often
illiterate population about the dangers of contracting the disease while
caring for the sick or preparing bodies for burial, Formenty said. "Our
simple message is very clear: don't touch sick patients and don't touch
bodies," he said.
