Mystery Thai illness strikes another tourist
--------------------------------------------
Another Thailand traveller was treated in hospital after spending
time in Chiang Mai, where a number of tourists have mysteriously died
since January. A 26 year old woman from Seattle [USA] became violently
ill on 4 Apr 2011 along with 2 friends after eating and using
restrooms at the Night Market in Chiang Mai, Thailand, on 30 Mar
2011.

The Night Market is next door to a hotel plagued with mysterious
tourist deaths since the beginning of this year [2011], including an
Edmontonian [Canada] who was found dead after using the hotel's
facilities 26 Jan 2011. His symptoms began with severe chest pain
keeping him up through the night, a close friend earlier reported. He
later died of "suspected natural cause", after being diagnosed with
acid reflux in a Thailand hospital and sent home.

The Seattle woman and her husband had to abruptly cut their one-year
world tour short, after 2 weeks in Chiang Mai resulted in the 26 year
old woman making 2 emergency hospital visits -- "the worst week of
their lives".

She was treated in a Chiang Mai hospital after suffering chest pains
and flu-like symptoms on 8 Apr 2011. They were staying at another
nearby hotel. "My hands and legs were shaking and really sore, and
later my husband told me that my eyes had rolled back in my head and
my lips were blue. We were really scared," she said.

After arriving at the hospital, staff ran tests including an EKG
(electrocardiogram) and concluded it to be either food poisoning or
acid reflux. While in the hospital, the couple ran a Google search and
discovered the 7 cases in the area of tourists with similar symptoms
since January [2011] -- all of whom died after experiencing similar
symptoms.

They returned to the hotel from the hospital, where the woman again
collapsed and began vomiting in the elevator. The couple packed their
bags and headed for the airport to catch the next flight home but once
in the car, she began convulsing again. They went to the hospital
instead. "All that could go through my mind was the stories of the
recent victims," said the woman. Medical staff hooked her up to an IV,
ran another EKG and did blood tests before sending her home.

Upon arrival back into the US, the affected tourist saw a doctor to
follow up on her symptoms and has an appointment with an infectious
disease specialist. "I'm feeling exhausted, relieved and sore. I am
hopeful that the source [will be] identified soon so that no one else
becomes ill and so that people can continue to enjoy the wonderful
city of Chiang Mai without worrying," she said.

"The doctors in Thailand said it was probably food poisoning and
dehydration. In Seattle, we haven't received all of the test results,
but initial diagnosis was infectious enteritis. I had an x-ray and an
EKG, and my heart looks normal. The doctor also referred me to follow
up with an infectious disease specialist."

The other Chiang Mai cases
--------------------------
The death toll now stands at 7 between January and March of this year
[2011] - all with similar circumstances.

An elderly couple from England died simultaneously of a heart attack
inside their Downtown Inn hotel room on 28 Feb 2011.

A 23 year old woman from New Zealand, died in hospital 3 Mar 2011
after she and 2 friends became ill in the same hotel.

That same day, a 47 year old tourist guide was found dead in a room
located next door to the New Zealander.

A 33 year old American woman also died after experiencing similar
symptoms as Carter. However, she was not staying at the Downtown Inn
and lab results for the cause of death have not been received. Her
husband has demanded the Inn be closed and that he receive the lab
reports.

A French woman was identified as being the 6th person to die with
similar circumstances.

Evidence of [a] coxsackievirus infection was found in the New Zealand
woman and [an] echovirus was found in another victim. Four of the
deaths have been linked to myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart
muscle that masks itself as flu symptoms or chest pain resembling a
heart attack.

The World Health Organization [WHO] told QMI [Press] Agency that the
cases are under watch. "This event is being investigated by the
authorities in Thailand," said Gregory HÃ¤rtl, communications of WHO
global Art and Response team. "The investigation is still on-going and
no conclusions have been reached. I cannot tell you much more than
that right now."

Freelance journalist Andrew Drummond in Thailand has been closely
following the cases and reported the Thailand Department for Disease
Control said so far there are no links between the deaths of cases
examined of people visiting Chiang Mai in January and February, and no
link to the Downtown Inn.

[The evidence for linkage between these deaths and cases of severe
illness remains almost entirely circumstantial, with provisional
diagnoses including food poisoning, myocarditis, and virus infection.
The association with the Downtown Inn in Chiang Mai seems no longer
considered to be the relevant factor. A final verdict from the Thai
authorities is awaited.
