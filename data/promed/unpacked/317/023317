Same District residents have been put on alert following recent outbreak of cholera as 23 persons already have contracted the disease, almost 8 years since the Kilimanjaro Region had last such a case. The infectious disease has struck Ruvu Village and the patients are currently being treated at a camp set at Ruvu Muungano Dispensary within the district.

Same District Commissioner (DC), Mwalimu Herman Kapufi confirmed the cases and called upon the public to carefully observe improved sanitation and use of clean water. Mr Kapufi advised the public to shun away from eating cold food or prepared at unclean settings. He said out of the 23 people who were getting treatment at the camp, 7 have recovered and discharged while 16 are still admitted.

The DC said that of the 16 patients, 14 are from Simanjiro District in Manyara Region while the rest are Ruvu villagers. Expounding furthermore, the DC said by late Saturday, 26 Mar 2016, 2 patients were in serious condition.

Two Ruvu Madege residents admitted to the centre, guessed that they contracted the disease after drinking unsafe water drawn from Pangani River. One said he felt dizzy while at his farm before he started vomiting. "The problem started yesterday [27 Mar 2016] while at the farm, I felt dizzy then started to vomit. I think cholera outbreak has been caused by canal water we use from Pangani River; it is not safe at all because we share it with cattle," he guesses.

As reported incidents of the health crisis continued to escalate, 19 new cholera cases have been confirmed in Naivasha town. The new cases have been reported in the sprawling Kihoto estate near Lake Naivasha. One of the latest victims had gone to visit the estate when he contacted the disease raising fears that he could have spread it.

A source from the public health ministry of Nakuru county termed the situation as critical warning that it could escalate to unmanageable levels. The officer who is not authorized to speak to the press said that the move to douse all shallow wells in the estate with chlorine was not helping. "The situation is worrying by the day as the number of those people affected continues to rise against limited resources," the officer said.

"Water consumed in this estate is not fit for animal consumption due to the high fecal matter but the residents are still drinking it," said the officer.

[5] Cholera - Somalia (Middle Shabelle Region)

At least 20 people have been confirmed dead in Southern Somalia following an outbreak of cholera, Horseed Media reports. The outbreak of the epidemic is linked to the shortage of water in the Middle Shabelle region with popular Shabelle River drying up. Most of the people died in the villages of Mandera, Ba'adley, and Raqeyle.

Earlier in March 2016, at least 5 children died of cholera outbreak in the same region with residents complaining lack of assistance from the aid agencies and government. Residents are worried that the small villages could be just as vulnerable to the outbreak due to lack of sufficient medicines and hospitals in the area.

Cholera, a highly contagious intestinal infection, is transmitted by water soiled by human waste. The disease leads to diarrhoea, dehydration, and death if untreated. Meanwhile, Somalia is facing its worst drought in decades. The humanitarian crisis has hit many regions in Southern, Central and Northern Somalia with many people needing emergency aid.

Mangochi district has been hit by a cholera outbreak and authorities say 2 people have died from the disease in March 2016. Mangochi hospital sanitation officer Kondwani Mamba said they have registered 12 cholera cases since 17 Mar 2016.

Mamba said they are suspecting that the outbreak has come from an area called Matipa, which is in Mozambique. He said a man from the district visited Matipa and when he returned, he began complaining of a stomach ache and other signs of cholera but luckily he got treated at Makanjira hospital. According to Mamba, another case involved 2 women from the district who have a farm close to Matipa and went to stay at the farm. When they came back, they suffered from cholera and 1 of them died whereas the other was treated and survived.

In a related development, the Mzimba District Health Officer (DHO), Khumbo Shumba, has denied reports that there is an outbreak of cholera in the district and in Mzuzu city.
