Following the outbreak of the highly contagious Newcastle disease [NCD] on a laying hen operation in the canton of Neuchatel in early December 2011, all the necessary measures were taken to prevent the spread of the disease: the killing of all animals on the affected premises and the creation of a protection and a surveillance zone. This allows announcing the "All Clear."

The official control steps and the results of laboratory examinations revealed no evidence of a further infection. All laboratory results of the samples derived from animals and their products in contact holdings and farms within the protection and surveillance zones were negative. Thus, a spread of the disease is excluded. Therefore, the measures in the protection and surveillance zones are to be removed today [27 Dec 2011] around the infected farm.

According to the investigations, the outbreak was discovered and contained during its earliest stages. The previous NCD outbreak in commercial poultry in Switzerland took place in 1998. Even then, it was an isolated outbreak that did not spread.

There is no health risk to consumers; even during a NCD outbreak, eggs and poultry meat can be eaten safely.
