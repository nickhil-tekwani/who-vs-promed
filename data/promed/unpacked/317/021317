Tuberculosis in cats and ferrets [2005 and 2006] (page 18)
----------------------------------------------------------
Incident
--------
in early 2005 the HAIRS group were informed by the VLA [Veterinary
Laboratory Agency, Defra (UK Department for Environment, Food, and
Rural Affairs), otherwise known as 'Weybridge'. - Mod.MHJ] of an
increase in the detection of mycobacterial infections in domestic
cats during 2004. The reports were predominantly _M. microti_ (10
isolates) and _M. bovis_ (6 isolates).

Process
-------
The group monitored reports over several months in 2005, and found
that a similar increase had also been seen in ferrets, including an
outbreak at a ferret rescue centre. Both _Mycobacterium bovis_ and
_M. microti_ were reported in cats and ferrets. The majority of cases
were in rural areas and involved the predominant spoligotypes seen in
the areas. Experts from Defra and VLA were consulted and it was noted
that the increase may partly have been due to alterations to the
charging arrangements for testing, which led to an increase in
submissions in 2004.

The HAIRS group investigated the situation regarding _M. bovis_ and
other potentially zoonotic mycobacteria in humans. The HAIRS group
were concerned over the potential for zoonotic transmission of
mycobacteria from these spillover hosts to their owners, however
there was no evidence to suggest that zoonotic transmission had occurred.

Outcome
-------
In response to the concerns of the HAIRS group a procedure was
initiated whereby HPA reference laboratories send isolates of
zoonotic mycobacteria from humans for spoligotyping at the Veterinary
Laboratories Agency, to allow further research to be carried out and
possible links between human and animal cases identified.

It was noted at this time that notification of TB in cats was
non-statutory and samples were received at VLA on an ad-hoc basis,
therefore identifying a trend was complicated. However _M. bovis_
became notifiable in all species during 2007 and this was likely to
improve surveillance. The HAIRS group are continuing to monitor this issue.

[HAIRS is a multiagency group under the Health Protection Agency
umbrella. Two things should be noted:
1. VLA charging arrangements changed in 2004 and there was an
immediate increase in submissions;
2. _M. bovis_ infections for all species are now notifiable, that is,
compulsory reporting. Both factors would have increased the number of
reported feline TB cases whether or no there was a true increase in
incidence. Unfortunately, this 9 Oct 2008 report does not cover 2007
feline TB events. - Mod.MHJ]
