Disease cutting into Georgia pecan yields
-----------------------------------------
A pecan disease enjoyed Georgia's wet summer weather and is now
blamed for cutting into what was expected to be a large crop, says a
University of Georgia [UGA] pecan specialist. The disease called scab
is the pecan's No. 1 enemy. The fungal disease scars husks, cuts
yield and hurts quality. It thrives in wet summer weather like
Georgia experienced this year.

"We had a good crop set early in the year, but we're seeing some
losses to disease now," said Lenny Wells, UGA. Roughly half of
Georgia's commercial orchards are planted in scab-susceptible
varieties. Some farmers sprayed as much as 15 times, or once every 10
days, to keep the disease at bay. They still had trouble staying ahead of it.

Pecan trees are alternate-bearing, meaning they produce a full crop
every other year. Most trees in the state are on the same cycle, and
this is an "on" year for Georgia pecans. Farmers expect to harvest 90
million pounds, 20 million pounds less than predicted earlier in the
season. Georgia leads the nation in pecan production.

[Scab caused by the fungus _Cladosporium caryigenum_ is considered
the most damaging disease of pecans. It became a problem in the early
1900s when farmers domesticated the crop in North America. Scab
attacks the foliage, twigs, and developing fruit. Symptoms include
lesions on leaves and immature fruit, and severe infection can lead
to defoliation, fruit abortions, and poorly filled fruit. The
pathogen is active throughout the growing season and can cause near
total crop losses.

The fungus overwinters on leaf petioles and stems infected the
previous season. Spores are produced in spring and spread locally by
rain and dew, or by wind and infected plant material over longer
distances. The disease is favoured by a moist climate but is not a
problem in arid regions. Pecan varieties vary greatly in their
susceptibility to scab. Most commercial varieties were at one time
resistant, but resistance has broken down due to adaptation by the
pathogen. The disease is managed by fungicide applications.
