On Thursday [21 Nov 2019], the New Mexico Racing Commission (NMRC), with the full support of the State Veterinarian of the New Mexico Livestock Board, ordered Zia Park and the Downs at Albuquerque to close their barn areas to horses originating from Remington Park in Oklahoma. A horse stabled at Remington Park was confirmed positive for equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) last week and subsequently euthanized.

The commission's decision comes the week before one of New Mexico's biggest days of racing, the Land of Enchantment day at Zia Park in Hobbs, N.M., on 27 Nov 2019.

"The sole reasoning behind the decision is to protect our New Mexico horse population and horsemen from suffering the way they did during the EHV-1 outbreak of 2016," said NMRC executive director Ismael "Izzy" Trejo. "Despite the decision to ban Remington Park based horses, Zia Park still has some solid horses shipping in for the Land of Enchantment card from other jurisdictions."

The ban on Remington Park horses will remain in place until further notice.

A horse was admitted to the Virginia Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine (VMCVM) Large Animal Hospital in Blacksburg, Virginia, on 17 Nov 2019 and was euthanized the following day.

The horse was confirmed on 20 Nov 2019 for equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1), the virus causing equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM).

The state veterinarian's office said all exposed horses at the hospital were isolated from the rest of the hospital population. Strict biosecurity protocols were established for the quarantine. All quarantined horses are being monitored 2x daily for fever (temperature over 101.5 F [38 C]) and other clinical signs.

The Virginia Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine Large Animal Hospital remains open for incoming patients. The state veterinarian's office is following up with all other horses that might have been secondarily exposed at the hospital.

The farm, which was home to the euthanized horse (the index case), has been placed under quarantine. Horses from the facility are being monitored for fever and clinical signs of neurologic herpesvirus.

The press release from the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services noted: "There is no cause for alarm concerning the general horse population in Virginia. EHV-1 is a virus that is present in the environment and found in most horses all over the world. Horses typically are exposed to the virus at a young age with no serious side effects. A large percentage of horses carry the virus with no clinical signs for the remainder of their lives. Rarely, exposed horses develop the neurologic form of the disease. Horse owners with concerns should contact their veterinarian. The Equine Disease Communications Center Biosecurity web pages http://equinediseasecc.org/biosecurity have more information on best practices for disease prevention in horses, and VDACS has more information on EHV-1 at http://vdacs.virginia.gov/animals-equine-herpes-virus.shtml. Horse owners also may contact VDACS' Office of Veterinary Services at 804.786.2483."

Information for this report was provided by the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.

["None of the available vaccines have a label claim to prevent the neurologic form of EHV-1 [equine herpesvirus-1] infection. It has been suggested that vaccines may assist in limiting the spread of outbreaks of equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM; equine herpes myeloencephalopathy/EHM is an alternative name for a neurologic disease associated with EHV) by limiting nasal shedding of EHV-1 and dissemination of infection. For this reason, some experts hold the opinion that there may be an advantage to vaccinating in the face of an outbreak. If this approach is pursued, only afebrile and asymptomatic horses should be vaccinated, and protection against clinical EHM should not be an expectation. The vaccines with the greatest ability to limit nasal shedding and viremia of the neurovirulent strain include the vaccines licensed for control of abortion (Pneumabort-K and Prodigy) and the modified live vaccine (Rhinomune and Calvenza)."
