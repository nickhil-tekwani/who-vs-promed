Ministry: PPR isn't a plague, but an already existing disease
-------------------------------------------------------------
Commenting on news reports circulated in Palestinian media claiming an outbreak of peste des petits ruminants (PPR) in the Palestinian Territory, and the failure by the Ministry of Agriculture to provide farmers with the needed vaccines, ministry officials say the disease affecting livestock "isn't a plague" but rather an already existing disease.

The Palestinian Ministry of Agriculture, confirmed undersecretary Lahlouh, has been providing Palestinian farmers with vaccines against sheep smallpox, PPR, brucellosis, and foot-and-mouth disease.

He added that the Ministry of Agriculture already bought 2000 shots of vaccine from Israel to be used temporarily against PPR until the company which won the bid brings the needed sum from abroad. The ministry estimates that 400 000 shots will be needed.

In the same regard, the Ministry of Agriculture's general director of veterinary medicine Imad Mukarkir told Ma'an that PPR "has been extant in Palestine since the 1950s" [see comment]. The disease, he added, does not break as a plague and older sheep are immune to the disease.

Mukarkir highlighted that in 2012 and 2013, about 650 000 heads of sheep were vaccinated against peste des petits ruminants. The majority of vaccines (450 000) were provided for free after the ministry received a grant from the Islamic Bank for Development.

Asked about the possibility of a quick outbreak of the disease, Mukarkir said the disease isn't quickly infectious and doesn't break as a plague. Only young sheep can be infected and the disease appears as diarrhea, but 95 per cent of the infected young sheep recover after vaccination, or after they become older.

With regards to statistics, Mukarkir said the disease was diagnosed in 76 herds out of 24 000 herds across the West Bank. He added that 514 heads of sheep died out of 974 which were infected.

Mukarkir pointed out that "there could be a serious problem if the vaccines are not provided before the [lambing] season begins in January 2014."

Vaccines, says Mukarkir, are available for urgent cases diagnosed in the field.

[The mention that "PPR has been extant in Palestine since the 1950s" is most probably a printing error. The 1st outbreak of PPR in the Palestinian territories was recorded and reported in August 1993 (OIE notification of 27 Aug 1993, OIE Bulletin 6(33): 135). The 1st outbreak of PPR in Israel was reported several months earlier. It was assumed that the disease was introduced from Lebanon into Israel and the West Bank (PA), and that it had been circulating in the region earlier (see reference below). Since 1993, PPR has become endemic in Israel and the Palestinian territories. In both, mass vaccinations with a live attenuated vaccine are annually applied.

According to the Palestinian Authority's annual report to the OIE, during 2012 (2011 figures in brackets), there were 71 (48) PPR outbreaks, involving 9599 (6412) susceptible animals of which 1054 (692) clinical cases and 413 (175) deaths. During 2012, 375 900 small ruminants (sheep and goats) were vaccinated; the number of vaccinations during 2011 was 334 500. Mass vaccinations against PPR are contemplated in Lebanon (see ProMED-mail post 20131109.2047088).
