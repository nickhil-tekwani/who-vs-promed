The Cali health authorities are on alert for a dengue outbreak that
has doubled the visits [to physicians] because of this disease in
various [medical] assistance centers in the capital. This was
confirmed by the municipal secretary of Health, Alejandro Varela, who
announced that since [1 Jan 2010], the Epidemiological Group tallied
282 cases, of which 123 correspond to the 15-44 year cohort. "We are
facing an increase in the number of patients, and so measures to
identify cases and breeding sites of _Aedes aegypti_ that cause
dengue [transmit dengue viruses] must be taken," Varela explained.

And so the Ministry of Social Protection declared a state of
emergency in the country due to the increase in cases of the disease.
The Secretary of Health warned that in Cali, the citizens must avoid
accumulation of water in their homes, in flower vases, plant pots,
[water] tanks or tires, since 52 percent of the [Aedes aegypti_]
breeding sites originate in these sites.

Up to now, the Comuna 17 (south) is the [area] most affected. In the
current year [2010], 25 cases have been registered and in 2009 there were 370.

The outbreak alerted by the authorities began at the end of last year
[2009]. According to the report from the Secretariat, in the last
quarter of 2009, 2552 cases were recorded, of which 89 percent were
classical dengue and the remaining 11 percent were DHF.

In the different health units in Cali, the medical visits for dengue
have skyrocketed. Jorge Sedano, a specialist in internal medicine in
the Imbanaco Medical Center, said that in this facility the increase
in [the number of] patients from this cause [dengue] have increased
up to 40 percent. "We have seen a gigantic increase in the most
recent months. We do not know if it is due to the weather, but for
certain we are facing a large outbreak," explained the expert.

Most worrisome is that this diseases is having fatal victims. Las
week [week of 11 Jan 2010], the University of Valle Hospital (UVH)
recorded the death of a patient. There is a very high increase in the
outbreak. "The most critical cases are coming to us because many
people do not take precautions. So, when platelets of the body (that
which causes blood to coagulate) are very low, the patient could
die," said Dr Harold Gonzalez, physician assisting in the emergency
room of the UVH. According to the doctor, children are most affected.
Up to 3 children come to the hospital per day, while in a week nearly
4 patients with dengue symptoms are attended to.

In the rest of Valle [department -- state or province equivalent. -
Mod.TY], control [measures] are also being intensified since the
number of reported [cases] in the region increased by 7000 cases last
year [2009]. In 2009 there were 10 171 ill individuals reported,
compared to 3184 in 2008.

The Valle secretary of health, Hector Fabio Useche, has now allocated
250 million [Colombia pesos] [USD 125 913] for prevention of this disease.

Remember to:
- eliminate receptacles that store water for more than a week, such
as tires, clay jars, cans, wash basins, plants in water and barrels,
among others;
- clean your laundry facility each week;
- fill your garden earthen jars, as well as the flower pot plates, with sand.

The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, which causes dengue [transmits dengue
viruses] can live in a given place up to 2 months. That is the reason
for the recommendation to wash all the water containers, in order to
avoid [mosquito] breeding sites.

Three cities in the interior of Sao Paulo [state] suffer from a
dengue epidemic: Aracatuba, Sao Jose do Rio Preto, and Ribeirao
Preto. in Aracatuba, there have been 335 confirmed [dengue] cases in
January [2010]. Aracatuba has already lived through several dengue
epidemics. The last was in 2007, when more than 1000 cases were
registered. The situation is worrying; action must be take quickly
because everyone is taking [ill], there are dengue cases in
practically every house.

In Sao Jose do Rio Preto, there are now 452 dengue cases this year
[2010]. "We are hiring trucks, we will hire qualified workers, and I
believe that within a week or 2 we will have 600 or 700 people
working in the fight against dengue in the city," said secretary of
health of Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Jose Victor Maniglia.

In Ribeirao Preto, the [number of] confirmed cases of the disease
reached 137. There are another 481 suspected dengue cases.

The state Secretary of Health of Sao Paulo does not yet have the
number of cases of dengue in the state this year. [2010] According to
the Epidemiological Surveillance Center, in 2009, 8148 people in the
state had the disease.

Portuguese,
<http://www.ribeiraopretoonline.com.br/saude/dengue-atinge-174-pessoas-em-ribeirao-preto/33727>)
the state Secretariat of Health indicated that the epidemiological
situation for dengue has increased daily and in the municipality
there are now 174 confirmed dengue cases and 557 suspected cases
awaiting laboratory results. Inspectors were denied access to about
28 percent of the houses to be visited and the city government may
seek court action to obtain access to these localities.

The manager of Epidemiology and of the Committee to Combat Dengue of
the state Health Surveillance Agency (AGEVISA), Marcos Ferreira,
explained that the fight against mosquitoes was intensified in
Rondonia, to counter the spread of disease. In 2009, 15 people died,
victims of dengue.

He said later this month [January 2010] AGEVISA will end the spraying
throughout the capital with insecticide to fight the mosquito that
transmits dengue [virus]. The technicians ask for help from the
population so that they should not leave containers where water can
accumulate in their yards.

Marcos Ferreira, explained that the insecticide was composed of a
vegetable base oil and is not harmful to [people's] health. "There
are many people who do not like the smell and close their homes when
they see the fumigation [taking place]. The correct [action] is to
keep the house open, because the insecticide acts only against the
mosquitoes," he said. He explained that AGEVISA decided to combat
dengue through the entire year, to reduce the number of cases.

In 2009, there were 22 689 [dengue] cases recorded in Rondonia, but
the number of illnesses must be greater, because many municipalities
do not tabulate the [case] data.

In Porto Velho, just this month [January 2010] 216 cases of the
disease have been recorded. From January 2009 up to now there have
been 1924 ill individuals [with dengue] in the [state] capital.
Marcos Ferreira recognized that the cases in Porto Velho may be more,
because many people do not go to the health centers [when they are
ill]. We have reports that daily, 500 people go to each health center
in the capital with symptoms of the disease, but generally, it is not
dengue. There are other diseases that produce similar symptoms, such
as malaria, he indicated.

Currently, the incidence of the disease is greatest in Jaru, Porto
Velho, Cacoal, Pimenta Bueno, Vilhena, Ariquemes, Ji-Parana, Rolim de
Moura, and Guajara-Mirim.

Goias is among the 5 cities on alert against dengue and the situation
is worrying. The number of cases of the disease is increasing greatly
since the end of last year [2009]. According to the Ministry of
Health, the other states confronting difficulties in combating dengue
are Rondonia, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, and Acre.

In the last 6 weeks of 2009, the dengue cases reported in Goias
increased 350 percent. Just in the 1st 15 days of January [2010],
there were around 1300 cases, an increase of almost 200 percent in
relation to the same period last year [2009]. In the Goiania city and
municipality the increase was 1200 percent.

The city has health posts that are improvising wards to attend to so
many people. Conditions are such that [patients] are receiving fluids
and medicines while seated. In many units, there is no place to
attend patients currently. Beginning this week, tents will be erected
in front of the overcrowded units that will serve as ambulatory
clinics, where patients can receive fluids and other assistance.

Dengue is a disease that is combated by prevention, eliminating
breeding places of the mosquito [vector]. Therefore, official
inspection was strengthened. In Goiania, almost 1000 agents are in
the field, working in collaboration with urban cleanup companies and
public works.

When the resident does not cooperate with the inspection, their homes
are being opened by court authorization. Any vessel that can
accumulate water is removed and taken to the garbage truck at the
same time. Just this week [week of 18 Jan 2010], the goal is to
inspect more than 68 000 properties, and the whole population is
being called upon to collaborate..

[5] Yemen (Taiz)
Date: Tue 19 Jan 2009

summ. Mod.TY, edited]
<http://www.sabanews.net/en/news203577.htm>


Since 1994, a strange and quiet mosquito has bred in Taiz. This kind
of mosquito transmits dengue fever [virus] among people so that the
pandemic increased in the city as the mosquito became established.

Despite differences over the number of infections with the disease
and fatal cases, all agree that the disease has become established in
Taiz and plagued the city amid ignorance of concerned bodies despite
of the fact that its danger is increasing. "If concerned bodies would
have intervened early, the matter would have been easier. We ignore
the disease, its reasons, and the environment in which it reproduces.
We do not even know the protection against the disease because we
didn't know it was dengue fever [until] only lately," said a Taizi citizen.

Physician Samir Sufian, director of Al-Rawdha Hospital, reveals the
size of the catastrophe affirming that public and private hospitals
receive cases of dengue fever. "Like any other public and private
hospital, we perform our duty and receive many cases, whether
infected with dengue fever [virus] or other cases suffering the same
complications of the disease," he said. "We have been receiving more
than 100 cases a day, all of them are not necessarily infected with
the disease [virus] but there are similar cases. Only 72 cases have
been hospitalized and [we] gave them blood platelets as the disease
reduces the blood platelets to under 60 000 units. All these cases
have recovered," he said.

Concerning fatalities, the director of Al-Rawdha Hospital indicates
that fatal cases have been occurring with the spread of the disease
but indicates "death could happen if there are accompanying
diseases." He estimated the number of mortalities has reached only 7
and there are similar fatal cases in other hospitals. " All of us are
responsible for society with all [its health] categories, the health
office is not solely responsible for deterring the disease and it is
not our responsibility to exaggerate the number of infections and
fatal cases," said Sufian.

However, the technical director of Al-Safwa Hospital, Abdurrahman
Saeed, affirms that the hospital has received hundreds cases during
the past 2 months, but he indicates that [dengue] infections with
disease have become rare during the past month. He expected that
fatal cases in Taiz are estimated in tens. "In our hospital, for
example, 3 fatal cases have been registered."

The secretary general of health, Abdul-Jalil Azuraiqi, says, "The
disease was not new, if concerned bodies had intervened early in
1994, the situation would have been better. The disease is now
terribly rampant and there are not enough efforts for combating it."
Concerning the victims of the disease, Azuraiqi says, " The number of
infected cases has exceeded 100 000 and 50 infected [individuals]
died; 7 physicians have been infected and one of them died."

Concerning state statements that the infection with the disease
[virus] does not exceeded 950 case and only one fatal case has been
confirmed, the secretary general of health says " there are 45 public
and private hospitals in Taiz governorate, 400 private clinics and
122 health centers even though government-related bodies have not
approved any statistics coming from these facilities and only
[recognize?] confirmed cases coming from the central laboratory [but]
even they are [under] review. However, we got our information from
colleagues in those hospitals, clinics, and centers."

Deputy minister of Public Health and Population for Health and
Planning Development, Jamal Nasher, says the ministry is working
through its office in Taiz to limit the pandemic by curing [treating]
all cases and helping the office to find diagnostic means to
recognize dengue fever. For his part Taiz deputy governor for
technical affairs, Abdul-Qader Hatem, says that the governorate has
adopted special strategy to fight dengue fever in Taiz. "The issue
has put all concerned bodies on alert to combat the disease. We and
the ministry's office here made a strategy [that] includes all duties
of concerned bodies because fighting the disease is not only the
responsibility of the health office but also [of] all concerned
bodies," he said.

According to him, the strategy aims at eradicating the environment
where the mosquito spreads the dengue fever [virus] via eliminating
the factors [that] led to the mosquito establishment in the city.
These factors are dominated by personal behavior, like storing water
for a long time due to the lack of water in the city, and waste from
workshops, houses, and cars. Based on these factors, the strategy is
divided into 2 parts; the 1st one concerns solving the water crisis
while the 2nd is to clean the city of all trash to get rid of
[breeding sites] of the mosquito which spreads the disease [virus] in
addition to awareness campaigns on the dangers of the disease and
[for individuals,] how to protect themselves against it.

Director of Taiz Health Office, Abdul-Naser al-Kabab, says the
disease was established in the city and the water crisis is the main
reason. He said the 1st appearance of the disease in Taiz city was in
1994 with one confirmed case and another case found in Jeddah,
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia at that time. The disease appeared again in
2007 when 220 cases of the infection had been registered. While the
disease spread in 2008, with 360 confirmed cases, the pandemic became
rampant in 2009 to the degree that Taizi people have become
terrified. The number of infected cases has reached 906.

Concerning the fatal cases, he affirms that there is no single
[officially] confirmed case of dengue fever and there may be
fatalities whether in hospitals or at home because of the disease or
for other causes. He cited that the office has distributed forms to
hospitals to report on fatal cases due to the disease or other
reasons and they have not received any notifications or death
certificates from any hospital.

Over the procedures taken for facing the disease, al-Kabab said, "We
have established operational rooms [centers] to follow up on
everything new and then communicate with the different concerned
bodies; we have focused on public education since protection against
the disease depends on awareness of factors behind the spread of the
disease and the environment individuals live in. A house-to-house
spraying campaign has also been carried out in the 3 most affected districts.
