The Department of Agriculture (DA) is enforcing strict quarantine measures
in the entire Visayas and Mindanao, as part of its action plan to contain
foot-and-mouth
(FMD) disease outbreak in Iloilo.
Agriculture Secretary Edgardo Angara said DA has mobilized regional and
locally-based technicians for intensified surveillance and approved launch
of an information campaign to encourage the public to report any
abnormality observed among pigs. Also, DA will be setting up FMD command
post manned 24 hours at the regional office.
He said shipments of pigs to Cebu have been stopped. All the veterinary
quarantine officers of Central and Western Visayas and Mindanao were alerted.
The National Meat Inspection Commission has sent advisory to Iloilo
municipalities, warning them of the disease.
Angara said vaccination was put on hold at the moment on recommendation of
the Food and Agriculture Organization. Instead, backyard pig growers and
commercial farms were advised to apply biosecurity measures.
Citing a report by DA regional director Arturo Pesayco, Angara said only 3
areas have been affected namely, Jaro and Molo districts in Iloilo City,
Passi City and the municipality of Oton.
"Generally, the situation is manageable and the disease has not spread
throughout the province," he said.
Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) laboratory results showed the FMD in Iloilo
was a type "O" outbreak, similar to the Luzon outbreaks that reached
epidemic proportion in 1995. It theorized the Iloilo incident may have
started due to poor hygiene and sanitation among commercial pig farms.
A local piggery farmer may have become the disease carrier after failing to
change clothes from his occasional trip to FMD-infected farms in Luzon.
BAI suspected the man may have transmitted the ailment to a boar when he
arrived at the farm. The boar spread the disease to other stocks within the
piggery and the problem worsened when the infected stocks were later sold
at the stockyard in the city.
