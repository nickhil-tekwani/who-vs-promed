The number of people killed by the so-called West Nile virus in
northern Greece increases to 9, while the number of people infected
has risen to 114.

The Greek Center for Disease Prevention and Control (KEELPNO)
announced the new total today, [26 Aug 2010] for the epidemic
unleashed in early August 2010, with registration of the 9th
fatality, which like the previous [fatalities] was an older person
who already had several health problems. Of the total of those
infected, 95 have had the central nervous system affected. Since the
commencement of the epidemic, 67 patients have been discharged and 36
are hospitalized, 10 of them in intensive care units.

The West Nile virus causes encephalitis and is generally transmitted
through mosquito bites.

However, according to KEELPNO, the variation of the disease outbreak
in Greece is of type B, and everything indicates that it has been
transmitted through migratory birds, who take refuge at this time in
the north of the country because the breeding conditions are ideal.

In regions affected by the infections transfusions and blood
donations have been banned.

[The number of West Nile virus infections has risen steadily from 92
on 20 Aug 2010 to 114 as of 26 Aug 2010. The outbreak is likely to
continue until colder weather arrives, so people in the affected area
should avoid mosquito bites.
