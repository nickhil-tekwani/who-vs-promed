The epidemiology of leptospirosis in animals has changed considerably in Israel throughout the past 25 years, which reflects on the incidence in the human population. In the late 20th century and the beginning of the present one, _Leptospira borgpetersenii hardjo-bovis_ was the main species detected in Israel's cattle, with about 50% of the beef cattle herds reacting positive serologically and sporadic outbreaks reported in dairy herds, from which isolated incidents of human infections were reported. It was not seen in small ruminants or detected in most of the wildlife populations sampled.

The past decade showed an emergence of the _Leptospira pomona_ serovar, initially in a single dairy herd, from which it was eradicated, followed by an outbreak in a large cattle-fattening holding in the southern part of the country. In the latter event, 148 calves of up to 8 months of age showed clinical signs of pyrexia, icterus, haemglobinuria and death, sometimes within 3 days from onset. The disease was eliminated by a series of antibiotic treatments, and the holding was confirmed free, serologically and by PCR, one year later.

_L. pomona_ was again identified in central Israel in 3 beef herds several years later; within the past 4 years, it has spread northward and eastward to reach areas in the Galilee, the Jordan valley basin and the Golan heights. Most cases were reported as widespread abortions and clinical disease as described above. Serological surveys of the wildlife populations found evidence of this serovar in jackals and in about 17% of the wild boars sampled when hunted. This figure is probably an underestimation because this serovar is host-adapted to pigs, resulting in shedding of the bacteria for prolonged periods after the serological titer has waned.

We have yet to be informed as to which serovar is implicated in the recent rise in human exposure. Many of these cases have been diagnosed based on the clinical symptoms and a history of bathing in suspect waters. Both _Leptospira hardjo_ and _L. pomona_ could potentially contaminate pools of water or streams in recreation areas where either free-range beef cattle or wildlife congregate, especially during the extremely dry hot weather experienced in Israel during recent months. A serological survey to monitor beef cattle herds has been initiated to provide the basis for a program to try to reduce the contamination of water sources and natural pools. Several options include fencing, supplying alternative drinking water for animals, and vaccination and /or antibiotic treatment of cattle. It should be noted that the commercial vaccines for _L. hardjo_ have been shown to prevent infection and shedding in cattle, whereas the vaccines for _L. pomona_ do not, albeit the level of shedding is reduced.

It is paramount to inform the public of the dangers in bathing in contaminated water, but it should be stressed that the bacteria is readily destroyed on drying and there is, therefore, no danger in visiting, hiking or touring such areas as long as one refrains from contact with the water.

_L. pomona_ has been identified also in several dogs. The vaccines available in Israel specifically for pet dogs contain, at present, antigens for _Leptospira canicola_ and _Leptospira icterohaemorrhagiae_. In view of the zoonotic potential, _L. pomona_ should be included in locally applied dog vaccines at the earliest opportunity.

[We are highly indebted to Dr. Bernstein, who volunteered, immediately upon ProMED-mail's request, to prepare the timely, needed, valuable expert's summary.

This event combines public and animal health, environment, climate, finance, tourism, politics. For illustration: Israel's TV Channel 10 has reported that, in view of the striking decline in the number of visitors and the mass cancellation of bookings, "those dealing with tourism in the Golan Heights demand that the government declare a natural disaster and compensate for the irreversible damage caused" (https://www.10.tv/news/170468).

For additional information on _L. pomona_ in Israel, and the (still pending) requests for information, please refer to <20170202.4811833>.

As indicated by Dr. Bernstein, _L. pomona_ is currently intensively circulating in north Israel's cattle and wild boars. Considerable populations of both species are located on the Golan heights, and might be related to the water contamination. Their possible high infection rate is suspected to be reflected in the pathogen's penetration into the jackal and domestic dog populations.

Bernstein's suggestion to include _L. pomona_ in pet dog vaccines deserves attention and early implementation.

All said, however, we await the final identification of the _Leptospira_ serovar causing the current human disease. When identified, its genotyping, as well as the genotyping of the animal pathogen, will be helpful in drawing a coordinated, effective control plan, the One Health way. - Mod.AS
