Public health officials in multiple states, with the assistance of
the CDC and the FDA are investigating a large multistate outbreak of
_Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Tennessee infections. Interviews
comparing foods eaten by both ill and well persons show that
consumption of Peter Pan peanut butter was statistically associated
with illness and therefore the most likely source of the outbreak.
Although the study did not specifically implicate Great Value brand
peanut butter, it is manufactured in the same plant as Peter Pan
peanut butter and therefore is believed to be at similar risk of
contamination.
The affected jars of Peter Pan and Great Value peanut butter have a
product code located on the lid of the jar that begins with the
number "2111." Both the Peter Pan and Great Value brands are
manufactured in a single facility in Georgia. These products may have
national distribution. Great Value peanut butter made by other
manufacturers is not affected.
As of 15 Feb 2007 at 3PM EST, 290 persons with serotype Tennessee,
the Salmonella type associated with this outbreak, have been reported
to CDC from 39 states: Alaska (1), Alabama (9), Arkansas (3), Arizona
(5), California (1), Colorado (10), Connecticut (2), Georgia (14),
Iowa (6), Illinois (5), Indiana (13), Kansas (6), Kentucky (9),
Massachusetts (5), Maryland (2), Maine (1), Michigan (5), Minnesota
(5), Missouri (13), Mississippi (3), Montana (2), Nebraska (2), New
Jersey (5), North Carolina (15), New Mexico (1), New York (32), Ohio
(7), Oklahoma (10), Oregon (2), Pennsylvania (23), South Carolina
(6), South Dakota (5), Tennessee (18), Texas (13), Virginia (17),
Vermont (4), Washington (4), Wisconsin (5), and West Virginia (1).
Among 185 patients for whom clinical information is available, 44 (24
percent) were hospitalized. There have been no reports of deaths
attributed to this infection. Onset dates, which are known for 171
patients, ranged from 1 Aug 2006 to 30 Jan 2007.
CDC's OutbreakNet (the network of public health officials that
investigate foodborne illnesses nationwide) has been monitoring this
outbreak, which has been prolonged and of low intensity beginning
with a few cases in August 2006 and gradually growing. Public health
officials have been working to identify the source of infection for
several months. Two closely related DNA fingerprint patterns have
been associated with this outbreak. DNA fingerprinting is routinely
done at public health laboratories in all states as part of PulseNet
(the nationwide network of public health laboratories that sub-type
bacteria).
Health officials and the peanut butter manufacturer are working
collaboratively to learn more about production of peanut butter to
determine how it may have become contaminated.
