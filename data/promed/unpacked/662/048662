West Nile virus as an infection was serologically detected in 130 healthy
equines (horses and donkeys) in Northern Colombia in late 2004; see article
in the Journal of Emerging Infectious Diseases in September 2005:
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol11no09/05-0426.htm>.
In addition, a good review of the current West Nile virus epidemiological
situation in Latin America can be found in a PAHO Journal article from 15
Mar 2006, at <http://journal.paho.org/?a_ID=3D307>.
