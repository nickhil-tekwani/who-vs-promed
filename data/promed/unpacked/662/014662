Carp Order follows viral outbreak
----------------------------------
The [UK] Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has
issued an Order prohibiting the movement of fish to and from Cudmore
Fishery, Whitmore, Staffordshire, following an outbreak of a contagious
viral disease in common carp.
The outbreak of Spring Viraemia of Carp (SVC) has no implications for human
health, but SVC is a serious viral disease affecting common and ornamental
carp as well as a variety of other species including tench, roach, rudd,
goldfish, pike and wels catfish.
The Order was issued after tests at the CEFAS Weymouth laboratory confirmed
the presence of SVC, a notifiable disease under the Diseases of Fish Act
1937. Fish Health inspectors are investigating the source of the outbreak
and tracing any fish that may have been in contact with fish at the infected
site. Before the Order can be lifted, the site must test negative for SVC
for 3 consecutive years. Alternatively, the Order could be lifted sooner if
the infected site underwent an approved clearance and disinfection
programme.
The clinical signs of SVC can include darkening of the skin, swollen eyes,
abdominal swelling, pale gills, trailing faecal casts and protrusion of the
anus. Infected fish may be lethargic and show areas of bleeding in the gills
and skin.
Anyone noting deaths of carp or any other species susceptible to SVC, should
immediately contact the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture
Science (CEFAS), Weymouth Laboratory.

[SVC, caused by a rhabdovirus, is one of the 5 infectious fish diseases
which are reportable to the OIE. The susceptible host species include:
common carp (_Cyprinus carpio_), grass carp (_Ctenopharyngodon idellus_),
silver carp (_Hypophthalmichthys molitrix_), bighead carp (_Aristichthys
nobilis_), crucian carp (_Carassius carassius_), goldfish (_Carassius
auratus_), tench (_Tinca tinca_) and sheatfish (_Silurus glanis_). However,
common carp is the most susceptible of these species and is the principal
host. The geographical range of SVC is currently limited to countries of the
European continent that experience low water temperatures during winter.
SVC has been reported from the UK in each of the last 6 years. The disease
is controlled by "zoning", namely "delineation (by regulatory means) of
free, surveillance and/or buffer, and infected zones within the country for
disease control purposes".
