At least 290 residents, including women and children of Eluru in Andhra Pradesh's West Godavari district, had to be rushed to a hospital late last night [5 Dec 2020] after mysteriously falling ill. Those undergoing treatment include residents of Eluru's North Street, South Street, Arundhatipet and Ashok Nagar areas.

The locals were rushed to the Eluru Government General Hospital in West Godavari district after they complained of headaches, vomiting, giddiness, and epilepsy-like symptoms. Doctors say the patients are now stable. At least 7 have been referred to a hospital in Vijayawada for better treatment.

A 45-year-old man who was admitted to the government hospital in Vijayawada with symptoms of nausea and epilepsy died on Sunday [6 Dec 2020].

Initial reports indicate that this could be a case of consumption of contaminated water. However, this is yet to be confirmed by local authorities.

Health officials visited the North Street area in order to collect water samples and blood samples to ascertain the cause of this illness. Local authorities are also conducting medical tests in each household in affected areas.

Deputy Chief Minister and State Health Minister Alla Kalikrishna Srinivas rushed to the Eluru Government General Hospital and interacted with the affected individuals. Doctors are trying to explore the cause for this mass illness, he said.

The situation is under control, and medical help is being provided to all those in need, Srinivas said, adding that medical camps have been set up to provide treatment to patients, and door-to-door surveys are being conducted to monitor the health of locals.

In all, 292 people, including 46 children, and 76 women were hospitalised, and around 140 were discharged after their condition was stable. Five people were shifted to a government hospital in Vijayawada for better treatment. The patients are also being treated in private hospitals, Minister Alla Kalikrishna Srinivas said.

He also added that water samples have been sent for testing to the laboratory, and no water pollution has been reported. Blood samples of the patients have been sent to the lab, and no viral infections have been detected, the Andhra Pradesh deputy CM said, adding that all patients were tested for COVID-19, and all reports were negative.

Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy also inquired about the incident and directed officials to provide all necessary help and treatment to the affected locals. He is slated to visit the patients on Monday [7 Dec 2020].

Expressing concerns, Governor Biswabhusan Harichandan instructed authorities concerned to ensure proper medical care to those affected. Andhra Pradesh State Health Commissioner Katamaneni Bhaskar also arrived in Eluru to take stock of the situation.

Meanwhile, TDP chief and former Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu slammed the YSRCP government for "neglecting" public health, which allegedly led to people falling ill in Eluru.

One person died, and more than 315, including several women and children, have been admitted to the Government General Hospital (GGH) here following an undiagnosed illness in the last couple of days.

The number of in-patients, which was 55 on Saturday [5 Dec 2020] midnight and 170 by Sunday [6 Dec 2020] morning, rose to 270 by evening and 315 by midnight. Unconfirmed reports said 50 more were undergoing treatment in various private hospitals.

Patients developed dizziness, headaches, and epilepsy-like symptoms. Most of the cases reported were from Kobbari Thota, Kothapeta, Toorpu Veedhi and Arundhatipeta, doctors treating the patients said.

Deputy Chief Minister and Health Minister Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas said Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had enquired about the situation.

A house-to-house survey was being taken up, and the situation was under control, the Minister said, adding that about 170 were discharged.

Seven patients were rushed to Vijayawada for better treatment, and their condition was stable, he said.

Medical teams from various hospitals in West Godavari and Krishna districts, staff of ward secretariats, and officials of the revenue and police departments rushed to the colonies and were attending the patients in the camps arranged on the streets.

"Water, food, and blood samples have been sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL). The reports are awaited. CT scan and X-ray reports of the [patients] are normal. COVID-19 tests were conducted for all the patients, and the results were negative," doctors said.

Collector Revu Mutyala Raju, SP K. Narayan Naik, Joint Collector Himanshu Shukla, senior civil judge D. Balakrishnaiah, and other officials visited the government hospital and enquired about the health condition of the patients.

Mr. Shukla said call centres had been set up at the Eluru municipal office. Residents may call over phone nos. 9154565529 and 9154592617 in case of an emergency.

"GGH superintendent A.V.R. Mohan and district coordinator of hospital services Dr. Mohan Rao are monitoring the situation round the clock," said Mr. Shukla.

"Patients are complaining of giddiness and headache. The recovery rate is good, and there is no need for panic," said District Medical and Health Officer (DM&HO) Dr. Sunanda.

Unguturu MLA Vasu Babu, RDO Panabaka Rachana, and Indian Red Cross Society chairman M. Jaya Prakash were among those monitoring the situation in the affected areas.

[This does not sound like food poisoning, as without some large party or gathering, which is not mentioned, it would be unlikely for this number of individuals within a small window of time to all consume the same food. If municipal water is contaminated, it is possible for large numbers to be affected. However, the mentioned clinical signs do not sound like it came from water, but testing should help shed some light on this mystery.

There is no mention of any airborne issues from nearby manufacturing or burning of anything that could be in the air. However, airborne issues are a concern with this number of people affected. - Mod.TG]
