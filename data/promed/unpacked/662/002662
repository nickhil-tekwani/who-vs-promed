Contaminated instruments used to examine the lungs were responsible for two
recent outbreaks of tuberculosis (TB), two new studies have found.
The studies, published in Wednesday's issue of The Journal of the American
Medical Association, found that two unidentified hospitals did not properly
clean bronchoscopes after use, resulting in the spread of TB.
An accompanying editorial said that as many as 2,300 people could be
exposed to disease-causing viruses each year if only 10 percent of
bronchoscopes are
contaminated.
The first study examined eight people in North Carolina with a rare,
drug-resistant strain of TB that had primarily been seen only in New York
state. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that five of
those eight people were family members or close friends. The remaining
three people had no contact with the others except for being tested with
the same bronchoscope in May 1995, the researchers found.
In the second study, Dr. Theresa Michele of Johns Hopkins University School
of Medicine discovered that a cancer patient contracted TB from a woman,
although the two had no contact with each other. Apparently, the
procedures were performed consecutively, in the same operating room, by the
same physician, with no intervening bronchoscopies having been performed.
About 460,000 patients undergo bronchoscopy each year in the United States,
and reported complications from infection are rare, wrote Drs. Richard
Wenzel and Michael Edmond from the Virginia Commonwealth University Medical
College in an accompanying editorial.
About 1-5% of all bronchoscopic procedures are performed on patients with
TB. If the instrument is used again, an estimated 460 to 2,300 patients
could be infected, assuming that 10% of the instruments are contaminated,
they wrote.
"They key message, in fact, is that hospitals and clinics cannot afford to
trivialize the importance of routine and thorough cleaning of reusable
parts of the bronchoscope," the editorial states. "Therefore, strict
protocols for routine and appropriate chemical disinfection or
sterilization must be incorporated into a hospital's infection-control plan."
