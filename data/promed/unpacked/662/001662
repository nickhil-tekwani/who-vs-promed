Canada: blood-borne transmission of simian foamy virus reported
-----------------------------------------------
Health authorities in Canada are trying to determine what measures need to
be taken to ensure the safety of the country's blood supply, after learning
that a little-understood primate virus can be transmitted through blood
transfusion. Scientists from the Canadian Public Health Agency reported
late this week [22 Oct 2004] that work with animal models has shown that
simian foamy virus can be transmitted through blood, leaving a question
mark over what steps are needed to protect Canadians who get blood
transfusions.
The research "identifies an emerging issue related to the safety and
adequacy of Canada's blood supply," the agency said in a news release
announcing the findings. It suggests Health Canada, as the blood system
regulator, take steps to try to keep the virus out of the country's blood
supply. The findings would be studied, and action will be taken, officials
insisted.
"Right now, people have absolutely no symptoms even if they have this
virus. But, because we know that it is transmitted through blood, measures
will be taken," said Nathalie Lalonde, a spokeswoman for Health Canada.
"We're looking at it and trying to determine what the next step is,"
confirmed Derek Mellon, spokesperson for Canadian Blood Services, the
agency that collects and maintains Canada's blood bank. "Right now, a risk
assessment is being done and we're taking a precautionary approach." Mellon
said the agency is considering adding a query to its screening
questionnaire asking about exposure to non-human primates. People who
respond positively could be asked not to give blood, he said.
Simian foamy virus is a retrovirus, which is the same class of viruses as
the human immunodeficiency virus. Upon exposure -- through contact with
body fluids like saliva or blood -- it integrates itself into the host's
genome, leading to life-long infection. It is found in between 70 to 90
percent of primates, such as chimpanzees and macaques, born in captivity.
The virus is not currently believed to cause disease, either in primates or
humans, though a question-and-answer page dedicated to the virus on the
public health agency's website admits that no one knows whether there are
health risks in the long term.
Cases of humans infected with the virus have only been followed for about
20 years. "Most retroviruses, if they cause disease, have a long latency
period," the website states. "We do not yet know for certain what the
long-term health effects are for people who have acquired simian foamy
virus. However, the evidence thus far suggests the risk is very low."
Studies suggest about 3 percent of people who work with non-human primates
are infected with the virus. It is not a risk to the general public. For
instance, visiting primates in a zoo poses no risk. Even the owners of pet
monkeys aren't believed to be at risk; the New World monkeys, which are
normally kept as pets here, are not known to transmit the virus. It came to
public attention in this country in 2001, when it was discovered that some
employees who work with primates at a Health Canada research laboratory had
become infected with the virus.

[It should be emphasized that whatever the route of transmission of simian
foamy virus, there is little, if any, confirmed risk of consequent disease.
No natural human infections have been confirmed unequivocally, apart from
rare zoonotic transmissions from non-human primates. Foamy viruses are
classified in the genus _Spumavirus_ of the family _Retroviridae_. These
viruses differ from other retroviruses in the larger size of their genome
and by the presence of large amounts of reverse-transcribed DNA in the
virion. No oncogene-containing member of the genus has been found, and no
diseases have been associated with any foamy virus in any host. Foamy
viruses are widespread, and exogenous viruses are found in many animals. A
feline foamy virus (formerly known as feline syncytium-forming virus) is
perhaps the easiest virus to isolate from domestic cats in view of the
characteristic rapid cytopathic effect. - Mod.CP]
