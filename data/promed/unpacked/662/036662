[The corn cyst nematode] _Heterodera zeae_ (EPPO Alert List) was first found in Afghanistan in soil samples collected during a survey carried out in the Nangarhar province in 2009. Cysts and 2nd stage juveniles of _H. zeae_ were detected from 5 wheat fields which had been previously cultivated with maize.

[Sequence comparisons showed strong similarity with _H. zeae_ isolates from the United States and Greece.]

[_Heterodera zeae_ parasitizes mainly maize and other monocots, including cereals, millets, rice, sorghum, sugarcane, and some grasses. In maize, yield losses of up to 40 percent have been reported. Symptoms may include yellowing and narrowing of leaves, delay of tassel development, as well as stunting and loss of vigour of plants. Symptoms frequently occur in irregular patches in a field.

The pathogen can persist in the soil for years as cysts. Nematodes and cysts are spread with plant material, soil, and by mechanical means (for example contaminated equipment). Once the nematodes have been established in an area, it is difficult to control or eradicate them. Disease management requires an integrated approach including phytosanitary and cultural measures, nematicides, and the use of (at least partly) resistant cultivars to keep populations below economically significant thresholds. While long crop rotations with non-hosts are often useful for control, alternating with wheat, as in the example above, will just provide a different host for the pathogens and cannot be expected to limit their numbers. Elimination of cyst nematodes from infected fields is usually not possible.

Different species in the genus can also cause significant yield losses in a range of other crops, such as cereals, soybean and potato.
