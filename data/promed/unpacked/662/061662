WHO response
---------------
WHO and partners continue to support the implementation of preventive and control measures in affected countries. In Guinea, an additional 5 experts have been deployed/redeployed in Gueckedou and Macenta to address community resistance and data and case management. In neighbouring counties, WHO continues to provide guidance on preparedness activities in accordance with the EVD preparedness plans developed by each country.

In Sierra Leone, health-care workers from affected districts are being trained to conduct outreach and active search for EVD clinical cases and contacts. Sites have been identified to set up Isolation centres in Kailahun and Koindou and are awaiting MOH approval.

WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.

This update has also been posted on the regional website of the WHO African Regional Office.

[3] Sierra Leone

Robin Faley, former Member of Parliament (MP) for Constituency 007, Kailahun District, this past week embarked on an Ebola virus disease (EVD) sensitization drive in the Eastern Region covering various communities.

During the campaign on radio, he educated residents, particularly those in Kailahun and Kenema Districts, on the recent outbreak of EVD in that part of the country. He used his knowledge and experience on the promotion of health to educate them on key issues related to the deadly disease including the signs, symptoms, how it spreads, prevention and what should be done in suspected cases of the disease.

He further admonished residents to be extremely vigilant in reporting suspected cases of EVD to the nearest health facility, assured that the disease would be contained if all adhere to the preventive measures, and he highlighted the role of Government in putting modalities in place since the outbreak of the disease in neighboring Guinea, as well as strengthening various health service providers to contain its spread.

He further appealed to patriotic Sierra Leoneans, particularly opinion and community leaders, to fully participate in ensuring that even the most remote community is aware of the disease, underscoring that EVD has now become a national concern that should not be politicized.

Robin Faley also encouraged residents not to panic as Government is fully committed to handle the disease, and urged media practitioners to be more professional in reporting on EVD to prevent unnecessary fear and panic, guaranteed that people are safe to travel to Kailahun and Kenema Districts and lauded Government and the Ministry of Health and Sanitation for their exceptional and proactive role to respond to the outbreak.

He went on to appeal to Members of Parliament from the regions to visit and sensitize their constituents about the disease and acclaimed Government for providing the required funds to MPs in the affected areas to ensure effective sensitization.

[4] Liberia, reminder
Date: Wed 4 Jun 2014

For weeks now across Liberia either nothing or very little has been heard about the deadly ebolavirus. Apparently, the awareness and sensitization characterizing the battle against the threat of the ebolavirus in Liberia have all disappeared from the airwaves, communities, schools, as well as offices among others, as if we, as nation, have beaten EVD. Despite reports of the threat of the virus in Sierra Leone, which kills between 25 percent and 90 percent of its victims, Liberian health Ministry authorities may still be complacent about the threat to Liberia.

Liberia and neighboring Sierra Leone share a common border just as does neighboring Guinea, where the outbreak was first reported in West Africa in recent times. More than 100 deaths were reported as casualties of the outbreak. Early last week [week of 26 May 2014], the incurable and highly contagious disease was reported in neighboring Sierra Leone with about 50 suspected cases and 5 people have died. [Now 95 (24 lab confirmed) cases and 6 dead, see above. - Mod.JW]

(EVD), which first emerged in Central Africa's Zaire (now Democratic Republic of Congo or DRC) 20 years ago, spreads from one person to another by contact with infected blood, bodily fluids, or organs or through contact with contaminated environments. Given the porous nature of the Liberia-Sierra Leonean border, as well as the cross-border interactions -- either through trade and commerce or farming [and funerals - Mod.JW] between citizens of the 2 countries, the experience from neighboring Guinea is also very possible. We must all remember that Lofa, Gbarpolu, Grand Cape Mount, and maybe Bomi counties are also situated on [Liberia's] border with Sierra Leone.

If nothing at all is being done towards awareness and sensitization in these counties, now is the time for the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare to accelerate its movement so that the threat of the deadly disease can be put under control. And if the necessary precautionary measures are already being executed by the Ministry, we can only appreciate Minister Walter Gwanigale and his Health Ministry team for intervening in time.

If, and only if, this is the case, what is most needed is vigorous public/community awareness and sensitization through the radio, especially those in counties at the border with Sierra Leone -- just a little beyond that which was done with the Guinean Ebola experience. We must not forget so soon -- EVD is still powerful and effective; if it could reach us from Guinea, it is also very possible to reach us from Sierra Leone.

In Guinea, the epidemic is spreading disastrously to new areas. In Sierra Leone, although cases (including some retrospective to the week before the alarm was raised) have doubled in the last few days according to official figures, EVD is killing only 12.5 percent of confirmed cases (see above), not 25-90 percent as quoted in the Liberian media.

Nevertheless, the wake-up call in the Liberian press is an important warning to that country not to think it has dodged the bullet. It is surprising that Liberia has apparently not been reporting the recent upsurge of cases in neighboring Guinea and Sierra Leone.

It would be a good thing if the example of a local MP in Sierra Leone making a health education tour of his former constituency were followed by politicians in the other affected countries. In view of the reported resistance to public health measures being taken in response to EVD, every means should be taken to spread health education messages about EVD to their populations . - Mod.JW]
