The use of chamomile is common among many people, particularly those of Latin origin. A study from Argentina found the contamination of chamomile by _C. botulinum_ is as common as that of honey. The diagnosis is easy enough if a pediatrician thinks of it. Any infant worked up for "sepsis" at that age should have the diagnosis of infant botulism considered.

Bianco MI, Lúquez C, de Jong LI, Fernández RA. Presence of _Clostridium botulinum_ spores in _Matricaria chamomilla_ (chamomile) and its relationship with infant botulism. Int J Food Microbiol. 2008 Feb 10;121(3):357-60. Epub 17 Nov 2007. [Abstract available at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18068252]

Abstract
"Nowadays, infant botulism is the most important form of human botulism in some countries. This illness affects infants younger than 52 weeks of age. The infection occurs in the intestinal tract; therefore, ingestion of _Clostridium botulinum_ spores with food is proposed. In some countries, people use chamomile tea as a household remedy for intestinal colics and give this tea to infants. Chamomile can be contaminated with _C. botulinum_ and could be a vehicle of its spores.

"Our aim was to study the prevalence and spore-load of _C. botulinum_ in chamomile. We analysed 200 samples; the 7.5% of them were contaminated with botulinum spores. However, prevalence of these spores was significantly higher in chamomile sold by weight in herbal stores (unwrapped chamomile) than prevalence in chamomile sold in tea bags (p=0.0055). The spore-load detected in all positive samples was 0.3-0.4 spores per gram of chamomile. We identified _C. botulinum_ types A, B, and F in 53.3%, 6.7%, and 13.3%, respectively.

"Chamomile (principally, unwrapped chamomile) is a potential vehicle of _C. botulinum_ spores, and ingestion of chamomile tea could represent a risk for infant botulism."
