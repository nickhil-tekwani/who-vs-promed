Hunter Local Land Services (LLS) has issued a warning after _Brucella suis_ was detected in the Hunter region [New South Wales/NSW] for the 1st time.

Hunter LLS said a feral pig recently trapped in the Upper Hunter at Cassilis had tested positive for _B. suis_ and said property owners and pig hunters involved in feral pig control in the Hunter region should be aware.

"While the feral pig population in Queensland and north-western parts of NSW has been infected with _B. suis_ for some time, the Cassilis case is the 1st time that the infection has been confirmed in a pig in the Hunter region," Hunter LLS said.

"_Brucella suis_ is a [bacterium] of pigs which primarily causes reproductive disease in pigs, but which can also cause disease in dogs and people."

"Dogs and people become infected through contact with blood and tissue from infected pigs when pig hunting. Dogs can also be infected if they are fed raw feral pig meat."

Hunter LLS said brucellosis can be a serious and even fatal disease in people and said pig hunters and property owners should take the potential risk to human health seriously.

According to NSW Health, feral pig hunters and others who are in contact with feral pigs should follow the precautions outlined in the Brucellosis and Feral Pig Hunting fact sheet [https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/factsheets/Pages/brucellosis-and-pig-hunting.aspx] to protect themselves, their families, and dogs against brucellosis and other common diseases transmitted from animals.

[Feral pigs are widely distributed in NSW, Queensland, the Northern Territory, and the Australian Capital Territory. They can be hosts of several diseases that can affect livestock and humans such as leptospirosis, tuberculosis, and brucellosis, among others.

_Brucella suis_ is a pathogen that can be transmitted to humans and spill over into the domestic swine population. - Mod.PMB
