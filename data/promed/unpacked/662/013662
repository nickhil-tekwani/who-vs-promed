[This epidemic persists in spawning the occasional new case, now reaching a
total of 26 infected premises. All are within the areas previously
infected. A new case was reported by OIE on 17 Aug 2001 and one was
reported on 27 Jul. Archived ProMED-mail postings indicate a move towards
lifting of some movement restrictions. Are we seeing the occasional case at
the end of outbreak, or does the continuing occurrence of new cases
indicate a more worrisome situation? Any comment from someone with current
knowledge of the situation on the ground would be welcome. - Mod.PC
