Week 46: 12 November 1998
Unexplained seasonal pattern of Salmonella enteritidis phage type 11
infections in
children - England and Wales 1998
_Salmonella enteritidis_ phage type (PT) 11 has been isolated in increasing
numbers in England and Wales in the past three years. One hundred and two
human isolates were reported in the first 44 weeks of 1998 compared with 88
in the same period of 1997 (data from the Public Health Laboratory Service
(PHLS) Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens). A total of 135 isolates were
reported in 1997, compared with 110 in 1996 and 89 in 1995. Almost all
isolates have been antibiotic sensitive. The seasonal pattern of reporting,
with an increase in late summer and autumn, is like that of other strains
of salmonella, but the curve appears to be shifting to peak later in the
year. [Their website has an excellent graphic displaying this shift. -
Mod.MHJ Cases are not obviously clustered, but northern regions have
reported more isolates. The age distribution differs from that of most
other salmonella strains, in that two thirds of cases each year have been
children under 5 years of age.
Interrogation of the Enter-Net database from other national laboratories
yielded no evidence of a similar pattern in other countries that contribute
to the network. Scotland reported some isolates of _S. enteritidis_ PT11 in
1998 and 1997, but the cases had a different age distribution. The other
participating nations have reported very few cases since 1996. Two
countries reported isolates from horses. _S. enteritidis_ PT11 has been
previously reported in hedgehogs in England and Wales*. The cases reported
in autumn 1998 are being investigated.
We would appreciate any reports of isolates of _S. enteriditis_ PT 11 from
humans, animals, or foodstuffs, or any other relevant information that
could help us with our enquiries, please contact Sergio Brusin
(sbrusin@phls.co.uk).
