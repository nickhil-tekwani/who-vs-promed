For several years Utah has ranked low among the states in vaccination
coverage among children aged 19-35 months for the entire recommended basic
series. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's
National Immunization Survey, Utah's coverage in 1997 for the 4:3:1 series
is 71%, the lowest among states, in contrast to the US figure of 78%. At
the same time, Utah's 3 DPT/DT coverage is 93%, not statistically different
from the US 95%, while its 4 DPT/DT coverage of 75% differs from the US
figure of 81% [MMWR, 1998, 47:26 (July 10), 547- 554.
However, GAO has reported that state coverage levels can mask substantial
variation within states ["CDC's National Immunization Survey:
Methodological Problems Limit Survey's Utility" GAO/PEMD-96-16, Sept. 19,
1996. Some specific geographic areas and communities are at higher risk
for outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases because they harbor
concentrations of children who have not received timely immunization. The
continued existence of such pockets of under-immunized children, sometimes
called pockets of need, is evidenced by the current pertussis outbreaks
centered in Salt Lake County, Utah and in Maricopa County, Arizona [ProMED:
Pertussis - USA (Arizona) and by 1996 outbreaks of measles centered in
Washington Country, Utah [ProMED: Measles - Utah, USA (6), Oct. 9, 1996,
and MMWR, 1997, 46:33 (Aug. 22), 766-769 and in Juneau, Alaska [MMWR,
1996, 45:36 (Sept. 13), 770-780.
Last year GAO reported what methods the CDC and the states are using to
identify pockets of need, determined that no one has evaluated the
effectiveness of the identification methods in use, and assessed strengths
and limitations of those methods ["CDC's National Immunization Program:
Methods Used to Identify Pockets of Underimmunized Children Not Evaluated,"
GAO/HEHS-97-136, Aug. 1, 1997. At that time, Utah and a plurality of
states were relying on provider assessments of children attending clinics
to identify pockets of need. However, GAO concluded that this method is
unlikely to be effective if used to identify pockets of need because
under-immunized children not receiving care in clinics may go undetected.
