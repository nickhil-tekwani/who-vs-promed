What is, to my knowledge, the first scientifically confirmed report of
chloroquine resistance in _Plasmodium vivax_ on the island of Borneo
appeared in the Oct 1998 issue of the Journal of the American Society of
Tropical Medicine & Hygiene.
The authors state in their introduction:
"The first report of clinical resistance came from Papua New Guinea in
1989, followed by successive reports of chloroquine-resistant vivax malaria
from Irian Jaya [the eastern half of the island of New Guinea, now part of
Indonesia], Myanmar [Burma], India, Sumatra & Sulawesi [both Indonesian
islands]. In the New World, chloroquine- resistant _Plasmodium vivax_ has
been described in Guyana [NE coast of S.America]."
Actually, I claim to be the first case of chloroquine-resistant vivax from
the island of Borneo. In 1956 I went there with some undergraduate
colleagues on the Cambridge North Borneo Expedition, & returned with a case
of relapsing vivax, in spite of having started on Nivaquine in good time
before leaving England, and taking it religiously every Sunday in Borneo &
for the required time after returning home. I was cured in the famous
Hospital for Tropical Diseases at St Pancras, London.
