About 30 head of cattle have died because of intoxication in San Juan del Rio [Queretaro].

Even though no other animal deaths have been reported as caused by the current drought in San Juan del Rio, there is collateral damage leading to the loss of ruminant animals, particularly in Santa Rosa Xajay, El Sitio, Potrero Nuevo, and Vaquerias communities.

"We are facing some collateral effects of this drought, since animals do not have enough food and they may eat some poisonous plants because they are hungry. These are the problems we are facing", said Mr Felipe Ruiz.

Animals normally avoid plants that may affect them and in recent years this problem (animals dying because of eating poisonous plants) was not frequent.

For this reason, it is very important that farmers take special care of their cattle, especially if they graze in open fields.

"Nearly 30 cases of dying cattle have been reported this year [2012], particularly during the last month. For this reason we recommend that animals be moved to areas where no poisonous plants are present. Where they have enough food available, animals tend not to eat such plants, but currently food is scarce and since animals are hungry, they just eat these dangerous plants", Mr Ruiz added.

Also, since there is not enough water in reservoirs and raised furrows, he also recommended that farmers impede their cattle from drinking water from such places as they may become stuck in mud. This occurrence led to the loss of some animals in the past years.

"Potrero Nuevo and El Sitio communities are using a well in order to give drinking water to their animals. They are also pumping water from some of their raised furrows to safe, artificial drinking troughs, since some times cattle may get stuck in mud and cannot be rescued on time."

[Drought can be devastating to animals for a number of reasons. Forage is in short supply for the animals and for making hay. Toxic plants can get baled into hay and in such a fashion the animal are not able to avoid the toxic plants. Furthermore, hungry or thirsty animals will eat plants they would normally avoid.

Water, or lack thereof, can also be a problem. Toxic substances such as blue green algae may propagate in ponds. The blue green algae may increase in concentration as the drought reduces the volume of the water. So, water may be come toxic as well.

There is not enough evidence presented in this article to know what type of plants are being suggested as the possible cause of death of these animals. - Mod.TG
