Report on the Potential Exposure to Anthrax -- Executive Summary
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducted an internal review of an incident that involved an unintentional release of potentially viable anthrax within its Roybal Campus, in Atlanta, Georgia. On [5 Jun 2014], a laboratory scientist in the Bioterrorism Rapid Response and Advanced Technology (BRRAT) laboratory prepared extracts from a panel of 8 bacterial select agents, including _Bacillus anthracis_ (_B. anthracis_), under biosafety level (BSL) 3 containment conditions. These samples were being prepared for analysis using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, a technology that can be used for rapid bacterial species identification.

What Happened
-------------
This protein extraction procedure was being evaluated as part of a preliminary assessment of whether MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry could provide a faster way to detect anthrax compared to conventional methods and could be utilized by emergency response laboratories. After chemical treatment for 10 minutes and extraction, the samples were checked for sterility by plating portions of them on bacterial growth media. When no growth was observed on sterility plates after 24 hours, the remaining samples, which had been held in the chemical solution for 24 hours, were moved to CDC BSL-2 laboratories. On [13 Jun 2014], a laboratory scientist in the BRRAT laboratory BSL-3 lab observed unexpected growth on the anthrax sterility plate. While the specimens plated on this plate had only been treated for 10 minutes as opposed to the 24 hours of treatment of specimens sent outside of the BSL-3 lab, this nonetheless indicated that the _B. anthracis_ sample extract may not have been sterile when transferred to BSL-2 laboratories.

Why the Incident Happened
-------------------------
The overriding factor contributing to this incident was the lack of an approved, written study plan reviewed by senior staff or scientific leadership to ensure that the research design was appropriate and met all laboratory safety requirements. Several additional factors contributed to the incident:
- Use of unapproved sterilization techniques
- Transfer of material not confirmed to be inactive
- Use of pathogenic _B. anthracis_ when non-pathogenic strains would have been appropriate for this experiment
- Inadequate knowledge of the peer-reviewed literature
- Lack of a standard operating procedure or process on inactivation and transfer to cover all procedures done with select agents in the BRRAT laboratory

What Has CDC Done Since the Incident Occurred
---------------------------------------------
CDC's initial response to the incident focused on ensuring that any potentially exposed staff were assessed and, if appropriate, provided preventive treatment to reduce the risk of illness if exposure had occurred. CDC also ceased operations of the BRRAT laboratory pending investigation, decontaminated potentially affected laboratory spaces, undertook research to refine understanding of potential exposures and optimize preventive treatment, and conducted a review of the event to identify key recommendations.

To evaluate potential risk, research studies were conducted at a CDC laboratory and at an external laboratory to evaluate the extent to which the chemical treatment used by the BRRAT laboratory inactivated _B. anthracis_. Two preparations were evaluated: vegetative cells and a high concentration of _B. anthracis_ spores. Results indicated that this treatment was effective at inactivating vegetative cells of _B. anthracis_ under the conditions tested. The treatment was also effective at inactivating a high percentage of, but not all _B. anthracis_ spores from the concentrated spore preparation.

A moratorium is being put into effect on [11 Jul 2014] on any biological material leaving any CDC BSL-3 or BSL-4 laboratory in order to allow sufficient time to put adequate improvement measures in place.

What's Next
-----------
Since the incident, CDC has put in place multiple steps to reduce the risk of a similar event happening in the future. Key recommendations will address the root causes of this incident and provide redundant safeguards across the agency; these include:
- The BRRAT laboratory has been closed since [16 Jun 2014], and will remain closed as it relates to work with any select agent until certain specific actions are taken
- Appropriate personnel action will be taken with respect to individuals who contributed to or were in a position to prevent this incident
- Protocols for inactivation and transfer of virulent pathogens throughout CDC laboratories will be reviewed
- CDC will establish a CDC-wide single point of accountability for laboratory safety
- CDC will establish an external advisory committee to provide ongoing advice and direction for laboratory safety
- CDC response to future internal incidents will be improved by rapid establishment of an incident command structure
- Broader implications for the use of select agents across the United States will be examined

This was a serious event that should not have happened. Though it now appears that the risk to any individual was either non-existent or very small, the issues raised by this event are important. CDC has concrete actions underway now to change processes that allowed this to happen, and we will do everything possible to prevent a future occurrence such as this in any CDC laboratory, and to apply the lessons learned to other laboratories across the United States.

CDC Director Releases After-Action Report on Recent Anthrax Incident; Highlights Steps to Improve Laboratory Quality and Safety
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a report today [11 Jul 2014] that reviews the early June [2014] incident that involved the unintentional exposure of personnel to potentially viable anthrax at the CDC's Roybal Campus. The report identifies factors found to have contributed to the incident; and highlights actions taken by the agency to address these factors and prevent future incidents. Based on a review of all aspects of the June incident, CDC concluded that while it is not impossible that staff members were exposed to viable _B. anthracis_, it is extremely unlikely that this occurred. None of the staff who was potentially exposed has become ill with anthrax.

While finalizing this report, CDC leadership was made aware that earlier this year [2014] a culture of non-pathogenic avian influenza was unintentionally cross-contaminated at the CDC influenza laboratory with the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of influenza and shipped to a BSL-3 select-agent laboratory operated by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). There were no exposures as a result of that incident. The CDC influenza laboratory is now closed and will not reopen until adequate procedures are put in place. Further investigation, review, and action is underway.

As a result of these 2 incidents, CDC is issuing, effective immediately, a moratorium on the movement (i.e., transfer inside or outside the agency) of biological materials (i.e., infectious agents, active or inactivated specimens) from BSL3 or BSL-4 facilities. The moratorium will remain in place pending review by an advisory committee.

Based on an internal review called for by the CDC Director, the report released today concludes that the scientists' failure to follow an approved, written study plan that met all laboratory safety requirements led to dozens of employees being potentially exposed. The report also found that there was a lack of standard operating procedures to document when biological agents are properly inactivated in laboratories as well as a lack of adequate laboratory oversight of scientists performing work in these labs. The report concludes that the critical nature of CDC investigations to detect and respond to naturally occurring and man-made events with select agents while ensuring the safety of staff are paramount and should be guided by the highest standards.

In response to these incidents, CDC has initiated following steps, in addition to the moratorium:
- Established a high-level working group, reporting to the CDC Director, to, among other duties, accelerate improvements in laboratory safety, review and approve, on a laboratory-by-laboratory basis, resumed transfer of biological materials outside of BSL3 and BSL4 laboratories, and serve as the transition group for the single point of accountability on laboratory safety called for in the review of the potential exposure to anthrax incident.
- Begun the process of establishing an external advisory group for laboratory safety. Invitations to participate in this group will be issued by [18 Jul 2014].
- Initiated an investigation to determine root causes that led to contamination of another avian influenza virus by the H5N1 virus.
- Reported the incident through the proper channels to the select agent oversight body, APHIS [Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service].
- Established a review group, under the direction of CDC's Associate Director for Science, to look at the systems, procedures, and personnel issues leading to this event and means of preventing similar events in the future. This review will be done in conjunction with the internal investigation and in coordination with the working group.
- Undertaking appropriate personnel action expeditiously.

CDC has also implemented or is in the process of implementing the following key recommendations highlighted in the report to address the root causes of the anthrax incident:
- CDC will establish a CDC-wide single point of accountability for laboratory safety.
- The Bioterrorism Rapid Response and Technology (BRRAT) Laboratory will not be conducting work with any select agent until a series of reviews and approvals are completed. BRRAT laboratory scientists do not have access to select agents, which have been placed in storage-only mode. These restrictions will remain in place until changes have been put in place to prevent similar future incidents.
- Appropriate personnel action will be taken with respect to individuals who contributed to or were in a position to prevent this incident.
- All inactivation procedures for laboratories working with select agents and other dangerous pathogens throughout CDC are being carefully reviewed and will be updated as needed.
- CDC will improve its response to future internal incidents by the rapid establishment of an incident command structure, as CDC uses for external events.
- The implications for the use of select agents, including for CDC's regulatory functions through CDC's Division of Select Agents and Toxins will be carefully reviewed to incorporate any lessons learned.

The report details the specifics of the June incident. The incident originated when a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratory at CDC prepared _B. anthracis_ samples for use at lower biosafety levels (i.e., BSL 2) in other CDC labs where live bacteria are not required for the research. Preparation of bacteria in this manner is routinely done within the CDC campus; however, in this instance, the lab used a procedure that may not have adequately inactivated the samples. Thus, the potentially infectious samples were moved and used for experimentation by researchers in these lower biosafety level laboratories, who, believing the samples were inactivated, were not wearing adequate personal protective equipment while handling the material.

The procedure used by CDC to deactivate the bacteria in this incident had been examined previously for effectiveness. Two laboratories, one at CDC and the other at the Michigan Department of Community Health, conducted experiments to determine the effectiveness of the formic acid/acetonitrile protein extraction procedure for inactivating _B. anthracis_. Both laboratories found that the extraction procedure completely inactivated preparations of _B. anthracis_ cells after 10 minutes. However, these CDC experiments using _B. anthracis_ spores showed that a very small number of spores remained viable, even after 24 hours of treatment with the extraction chemicals. This result is not unexpected as bacterial spores are typically much more resistant to chemical inactivation than bacterial cells. After the incident was recognized, environmental testing for _B. anthracis_ was done in the 3 CDC BSL-2 laboratories that had received specimens from the BSL-3 laboratory to determine if any of the bacteria had been disseminated more broadly. No evidence of environmental contamination was found.

Although a sterility check done by the BSL-3 lab showed that the anthrax preparation had not been inactivated after a 10-minute extraction, the preparation had been extracted for 24 hours before transfer to the BSL-2 labs. At that point, all or the great majority of _B. anthracis_ cells and spores would have been inactivated.

CDC is committed to ensuring that people feel safe and are safe in the workplace and the community as employees conduct life-saving laboratory work.

Select agents are biological agents and toxins that HHS [US Department of Health and Human Services] and USDA have determined have the potential to pose a severe threat to public health and/or animal health, or to plant health; or to agricultural animal or plant products.

[The CDC has officially announced that the BRRAT Laboratory is closed until further notice. This closure creates a very dangerous vacuum in the CDC Biological Laboratory Response Network (LRN-B). The BRRAT Laboratory was responsible for producing DFA (direct fluorescent antibody) and real-time PCR reagents for the entire LRN-B, including _Bacillus anthracis_. Latterly diagnostic laboratories have switched over to PCR diagnosis of _B. anthracis_, which is quick and very reliable. And now these events push them back into glassware technology, sheep blood agar, and differentiating _B. anthracis_ from _B. cereus_ based on the former being non-haemolytic and penicillin sensitive. Unfortunately some 3-6 percent of _B. anthracis_ seen in the US are penicillin resistant, and a similar percentage is phage resistant. PCR gets around this recognition problem. So I would recommend that any laboratory tempted to reject a _Bacillus_ growth might put it aside for rechecking when PCR primers again are available.

But we still have the M'Fadyean stain for visualising the _B. anthracis_ cell capsule. Michael Owen has updated this classic diagnostic stain. See: Michael P Owen, Willy Schauwers, Martin E Hugh-Jones, John A Kiernan, Peter Charles Bruce Turnbull, Wolfgang Beyer. 2013. A simple, reliable M'Fadyean stain for visualizing the _Bacillus anthracis_ capsule. Journal of Microbiological Methods, 92 (2): 264-269. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167701213000134.

If anyone needs advice, Michael's email address is <owenmp@seanet.com>.

This improved M'Fadyean stain has been shown to be reliable under field conditions in Afghanistan and can be made in large quantities on demand. I have Michael's permission to share this with you all. - Mod.MHJ]
