WHO - Asia must change age-old farming practices to stop
disease
----------------------------------------------------------------
Asia must change age-old farming practices to reduce contact
between people and poultry to limit avian influenza and
prevent new animal diseases infecting humans, the World
Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday [21 Sep 2005].
In launching a 5-year plan to combat emerging diseases in
the Asia-Pacific region, WHO said on average one new disease
had occurred every year for the past 20 years, mainly in
Africa and Asia, and eventually one will become a pandemic.
"Even if you control avian influenza, the next one is
coming," said Dr Shigeru Omi, WHO's regional director for
the Western Pacific, which stretches from China to Fiji. "I
think it is similar to tsunamis and earthquakes ... we do
not know when," Omi told WHO's Western Pacific annual
conference in Noumea, capital of New Caledonia in the South
Pacific.
Avian influenza was 1st detected in South Korea in 2003,
only months after SARS was contained, and quickly spread
within months to Taiwan, Viet Nam, Indonesia, Thailand,
Malaysia and China. The contagious H5N1 strain of the
disease has since killed 64 people [only 59 of these cases
have been confirmed by laboratory tests - Mod.CP] in 4 Asian
countries and has spread to Russia and Europe [that is,
European Russia], sparking global fears it could mutate and
become a pandemic killing millions of people. The latest
deaths prompted Indonesia on Wednesday [21 Sep 2005] to say
an outbreak in the capital Jakarta could be called an
epidemic. [Only 2 deaths in Indonesia have been definitively
attributed to avian influenza virus infection by laboratory
testing. - Mod.CP]
Millions of poultry have been culled since 2003, but bird
flu still spreads. "In my view, this is connected to the
differences in the farming practices. In the West, farming
practices are well controlled: ducks, chickens, and humans
do not mingle together," Omi said. "Unless we address this
fast, we have to expect more emerging diseases, particularly
zoonoses."
Omi said the spread of avian flu in Asia over the past 2
years was related to areas of high population and high
human-to-poultry contact. "If you look at the poultry
density for Asia, southern China, Viet Nam, (and) Cambodia
have very dense populations. In the past 2 years, outbreaks
of avian influenza correspond to where (poultry) population
density is very high," he said. Cambodia and Viet Nam, where
poultry is farmed in backyards and where farmers live in
close proximity to chickens and ducks, have borne the brunt
of avian flu deaths. Omi said Western Europe had equally
dense poultry populations but did not experience the same
level of diseases as Asia.
WHO said 75 per cent of infectious diseases in the past 30
years originated from animals (zoonoses), and the
Asia-Pacific was "the epicenter for such epidemics." Dengue
fever, Japanese encephalitis, leptospirosis, Nipah virus and
drug-resistant malaria are some of the diseases now
entrenched in the region, it said. Omi said globalization,
which had seen an increase in the movement of goods and
people in Asia, and common borders had also contributed to
the spread of diseases like SARS and avian influenza. "There
is an urgent need to strengthen inter-country and
bioregional collaboration," he said. WHO's "Asia-Pacific
Strategy for Emerging Diseases" plan launched on Wednesday
[21 Sep 2005] calls for greater cooperation between
Asia-Pacific nations to ensure early detection and rapid
response to emerging diseases. The plan said that although
most countries had surveillance systems for communicable
diseases, they were not capable of being used as early
warning systems.
"Many countries are still vulnerable to future disease
outbreaks, and most countries are still not well prepared
for early detection and rapid response to emerging disease,"
it said.
