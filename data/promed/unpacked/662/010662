The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is recalling a brand of apple cider over concerns it may be contaminated with _E. coli_. The agency is warning people to not consume certain unpasteurized apple cider products produced by Rolling Acres Cider Mill. The products were sold on Sat 11 Oct 2014 at the St. Jacob's Farmers' Market. They were sold in different types of containers, including plastic jugs and unlabelled soft plastic bags, similar to milk bags. The cider was also sold at the company's location in Waterloo.

Three people have become ill due to _E. coli_ O157:H7 after reportedly drinking unpasteurized apple cider linked to Rolling Acres Apple Cider Mill. If any more cases arise, the CFIA says they will be investigated to determine whether they are associated with unpasteurized apple cider.

"I strongly warn the public not to consume the affected product and check their freezers in particular to discard any frozen unpasteurized apple cider," says Dr. David Mowat, Ontario Interim Chief Medical Officer of Health. "_E. coli_ O157:H7 infection can cause serious illness; anyone who may have consumed the product and shows signs of infection, such as stomach cramps, diarrhea or bloody diarrhea, fever, nausea and/or vomiting, should see a health care provider immediately." [Actually fever is NOT a significant manifestation of EHEC infection. - Mod.LL]

Ontarians are reminded to check their fridges and freezers for the recalled product, and if any is found, it is recommended that it be thrown out right away.

[That the unpasteurized apple cider is the vehicle for the cases of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ is not proven as yet, but this circumstance has been reported in the past. Two events need to happen for this to occur: 1st, the apples need to be harvested from the ground (after falling from the tree) from a field contaminated with animal feces or washed with tainted water and 2nd, the cider produced from the contaminated apples is not pasteurized or similarly treated. - Mod.LL
