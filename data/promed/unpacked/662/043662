[This post is derived from a FluTrackers.com
(http://www.flutrackers.com) report prepared by Gert van der Hoek.

As of 10 Oct 2011, 179 human cases of avian A/H5N1 influenza virus
infection and 147 fatalities had been confirmed by WHO. The cases
described above bring the totals to 181 and 149 as stated above.

This report may in fact refer to the 2 siblings (previously reported
to be both male children) who were suspected to have died as a result
of A/H5N1 virus infection in Bangli about this time (see ProMED-mail
references below). This appears to be official clarification of the
provisional diagnosis. Direct confirmation from WHO is awaited. -
