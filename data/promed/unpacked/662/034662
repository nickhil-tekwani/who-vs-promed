Health officials said Wednesday [15 Aug 2001] that 8 people have been
sickened in an _E. coli_ outbreak that may be linked to a county fair, and
51 other possible cases are being investigated. Currently 3 children are
hospitalized.
The Ozaukee County health department said the confirmed cases were among
people who attended the Ozaukee County Fair from 1-5 Aug 2001, but the
source of the bacteria is still being investigated.
Children's Hospital of Wisconsin has treated 5 children with potentially
deadly _E. coli_ infections, said spokeswoman Melissa Douglas. It was not
clear Wednesday if the 5 patients were among the 8 cases counted by Ozaukee
County, which neighbors Milwaukee.
Douglas said parents of the 3 children still hospitalized requested that
information on their conditions not be released.
Health officials were questioning other people who showed symptoms to
confirm whether they had _E. coli_ infections and to try to identify the
source of the bacteria, said Mary DeLuca, Ozaukee County public health
assistant director. "We are at the very, very beginning of this
investigation," DeLuca said.
_E. coli_ O157:H7 is a bacterium that causes bloody diarrhea, stomach
cramps, fatigue, and nausea, but can lead to fatal complications. Younger
children, adults with other health problems, and older adults are most
susceptible.
The source of the disease may have been contaminated food or water, or an
adult or child petting an infected animal, said Glenda Madlom, Ozaukee
County public health director. County health officials would not say where
they were focusing their investigation.
State inspectors conducted routine visits at the fair on 1 and 2 Aug 2001,
said Thomas Sieger of the state Department of Health and Family Services.
Ken Riemer, president of the Ozaukee County Fair Board, said fair officials
accompany state inspectors and would have known about any health violations.
This is the third major _E. coli_ outbreak in the Milwaukee area in a year.
More than 20 students at Bethesda Elementary School in Waukesha were
infected last October by a lunch in a school cafeteria, health officials said.
An outbreak of _E. coli_-related illness at 2 Milwaukee area Sizzler
restaurants last summer sickened more than 60 people and killed a
3-year-old girl.
