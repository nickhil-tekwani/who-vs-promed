There's been an increase in syphilis cases among gay and bisexual men in the Christchurch region, following similar trends in Auckland and Hamilton. The New Zealand AIDS Foundation [NZAF] says average monthly syphilis cases in Christchurch have increased 100 per cent over the past 18 months. [The NZAF is] encouraging gay and bisexual men to use condoms and lube for anal sex and to get tested.

The NZAF says if a person has syphilis, they are also more likely to get HIV and pass it on. "It is vital to continue to use condoms and lube for anal sex because unprotected anal sex makes it easy for STIs [sexually transmitted infections] and HIV to be passed on. Evidence shows that 8 in 10 gay and bisexual Kiwis use condoms for anal sex with casual partners and we encourage them to continue doing so."

It's possible to have syphilis with no symptoms and it is also possible to pass it onto others when you don't have symptoms. Many people who have syphilis aren't aware they have it, particularly if it's in their throat or rectum.

Syphilis can produce a painless sore on your penis, in your anus or in your mouth 10-90 days after infection. The sore usually turns into a scab and heals after 2-6 weeks, but the infection remains. If left untreated, syphilis can cause damage to your nerves, bones, skin, eyes and brain. GPs can provide full sexual health check-ups, or free tests can be booked in Christchurch at NZAF Te Toka or Christchurch Sexual Health Services.

[The above news report says that the incidence of syphilis continues to increase in New Zealand in the past year and a half among men who have sex with men (MSM) and in bisexual men. ProMED-mail previously reported on the increasing frequency of syphilis in MSM in New Zealand in 2013 (Syphilis - New Zealand: (CA) MSM 20130309.1579043 and Syphilis - New Zealand: increased incidence, MSM, urban centers 20150118.3101169). Some of this continued increase may be due to an increased frequency of testing for syphilis in MSM. The increasing numbers of men who have sex with men who also have unprotected sex with wives and girlfriends may lead to a rising incidence of syphilis in women and congenital syphilis.

Cases among MSM have been characterized by high rates of HIV co-infection and high-risk sexual behaviors in many localities worldwide. An article posted by ProMED-mail reported that HIV-infected MSM seek out other HIV-positive sex partners to avoid using condoms ("serosorting"), which, of course, would allow transmission of syphilis, gonorrhea, and other sexually transmitted diseases among HIV-infected MSM, without resulting in an increase in HIV infections (ProMED-mail post Syphilis & gonococcal dis. - USA (04): (OR) rising incidence, MSM, HIV coinfect. 20140608.2527642).

The Canterbury region of New Zealand is located on the South Island; Christchurch is the largest city in the South Island, with a population of around 300 000.
