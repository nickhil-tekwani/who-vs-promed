Pet frogs are being blamed for a national salmonellosis outbreak that
sickened at least 48 people. The illnesses occurred from June 2009
through November 2009, with reports coming in from 25 states. Health
officials investigating the illnesses found that many of the people
said they'd been in contact with frogs such as the African dwarf
frog. The salmonella strain was found in aquariums with frogs in 3
homes where illnesses occurred. The CDC reported the outbreak Monday
[7 Dec 2009].

Pet reptiles have been fingered as a source of salmonellosis before.
At least 107 people were sickened in a recent outbreak blamed on turtles.

[2] CDC report

CDC is collaborating with public health officials in many states to
investigate a multistate outbreak of human _Salmonella [enterica_]
serotype Typhimurium infections due to contact with water frogs
including African dwarf frogs. Water frogs commonly live in aquariums
or fish tanks. Amphibians such as frogs and reptiles such as turtles,
are recognized as a source of human salmonellosis. In the course of
routine assessment, a number of cases with the same strain have been
identified over many months.

As of 12pm EST on 7 Dec 2009, 48 individuals infected with the
outbreak strain of _S._ Typhimurium have been reported from 25
states. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as
follows: Arizona (1), California (2), Colorado (2), Florida (1),
Georgia (1), Idaho (1), Illinois (5), Kentucky (1), Louisiana (1),
Massachusetts (2), Maryland (2), Michigan (3), Minnesota (1),
Missouri (2), Mississippi (1), New Jersey (2), New Mexico (1), New
York (1), Ohio (2), Pennsylvania (3), Tennessee (2), Texas (3), Utah
(6), Virginia (1), and Washington (1).

Among the persons with reported dates available, illnesses began
between 24 Jun 2009 and 14 Nov 2009. Infected individuals range in
age from less than 1 year old to 54 years old. 77 percent of patients
are younger than 10 years old and the median age is 4 years. 55
percent of patients are female. No deaths have been reported.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
In an epidemiologic study, ill persons answered questions about
contact with animals and foods consumed during the days before
becoming ill and investigators compared their responses to those of
persons of similar age and gender previously reported to State Health
Departments with other illnesses. Preliminary analysis of this study
suggests contact with frogs, including water frogs such as African
dwarf frogs, is a likely source of the infections. In addition,
environmental samples taken from aquariums containing aquatic frogs
in 3 homes of ill persons have yielded isolates of _S._ Typhimurium
matching the outbreak strain.

Advice to consumers
-------------------
- always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after touching any
amphibian (such as a frog) or reptile (such as a turtle), their
housing, or anything (for example, food) that comes in contact with
them or their housing. Adults should assist young children with hand washing;
- watch for symptoms of salmonellosis infection, such as diarrhea,
fever, and abdominal cramps. Call your health care provider if you or
a family member has any of these symptoms;
- persons at increased risk for serious infection from salmonellosis
are children less than 5 years old, elderly persons, and persons with
weakened immune systems. These persons should avoid contact with
amphibians (such as frogs) and reptiles (such as turtles) and
anything that comes in contact with them (for example, aquarium,
habitat, and water);
- keep amphibians and reptiles out of homes with children younger
than 5 years old or people with weakened immune systems.

Placement and maintenance of habitats
-------------------------------------
- amphibians (for example frogs) and reptiles (for example turtles)
should not be kept in child-care centers;
- habitats containing amphibians or reptiles should not be kept in a
child's bedroom, especially children aged less than 5 years;
- do not allow amphibians or reptiles to roam freely through the
house, especially in food preparation areas;
- keep amphibians and reptiles out of kitchens and other areas where
food and drink are prepared or served to prevent contamination;
- habitats and their contents should be carefully cleaned outside of
the home. Use disposable gloves when cleaning and do not dispose of
water in sinks used for food preparation or for obtaining drinking water;
- do not bathe animals or their habitats in the kitchen sink. If
bathtubs are used for these purposes, they should be thoroughly
cleaned afterward. Use bleach to disinfect a tub or other place where
reptile or amphibian habitats are cleaned;
- children aged less than 5 years should not clean habitats;
- always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after cleaning habitats.

Advice to pet store owners & others who sell or display amphibians and reptiles
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- pet store owners and others who sell or display amphibians (such as
frogs) and reptiles (such as turtles) should provide information to
owners and potential purchasers of amphibians and reptiles about the
risks of acquiring salmonellosis from these animals;
- more information on displaying animals in public settings can be
found in the 2009 Compendium of Measures to Prevent Diseases
Associated with Animals in Public Settings
[<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5805a1.htm>].

Advice to health care providers
-------------------------------
- health care providers should question patients on pet and animal
ownership and should provide education about the risks of acquiring
salmonellosis from amphibians (such as frogs) and reptiles (such as turtles);
- health care providers should advise patients on proper hand washing
practices.

Advice to veterinarians
-----------------------
- veterinarians should provide education to amphibian and reptile
owners about the risks of acquiring salmonellosis from these animals;
- veterinarians should provide education to amphibian and reptile
owners on how to properly clean the animal habitat.

[Although the link between human salmonellosis and pet turtles is
commonly known, this posting is a reminder that amphibians such as
frogs as well as other reptiles such as snakes can also be carriers
of the disease. - Mod.LL]
