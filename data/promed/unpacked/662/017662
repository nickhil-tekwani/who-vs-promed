The state has issued an alert over the outbreak of the Rift Valley Fever [RVF] in Rift valley region, advised farmers to vaccinate their livestock against it as a deterrent measure. The principal Secretary for livestock Mr. Harry Kimtai said that there is a looming danger of the disease following the heavy rainfall experienced countrywide noting that county governments should ensure that they roll out a massive vaccination of livestock.

[2] Kenya - Alerts, ministries of Agriculture and Health

An alert has been issued over the possible outbreak of RVF in parts of the country due to the ongoing rains. The alert from the ministries of Health and Agriculture named 15 counties as high-risk areas.

The notice was signed by Director of Veterinary Services Obadiah Njagi and his Health counterpart, Jackson Kioko. According to Dr. Njagi, there was increased risk of RVF due to increased cases of flooding. He noted that flooding not only caused displacement of people and animals but also increased the risk of diseases transmitted by mosquitoes such as RVF; "a viral disease of livestock which also affects human beings if they get into contact with blood or tissues from infected animals," he said.

Njagi noted that certain groups, such as herders, slaughterhouse workers, farmers and veterinarians, were at higher risk of getting infected. "The virus can be transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during slaughtering, during births or while conducting veterinary procedures," he said. He added that the last outbreak of the disease was recorded during the El Nino rains in 2006/2007, where around 160 people died and Sh4 billion [39 million USD] loss was recorded in the livestock sector.

And Dr. Kioko called on the public to be cautious and stop slaughtering livestock at home without veterinary inspection. He advised the public to use protective gear while assisting livestock give birth or while removing stillbirths. He added that slaughtering or consuming food from sick or dead animals should be avoided and all suspicious deaths of livestock reported to relevant offices.

"We are asking the public to use treated mosquito nets and repellants to keep away the insects that easily spread the virus mainly in flooded areas," he said. Kioko further advised those who get a fever to report to the nearest health centre for treatment. "To help in early detection and response in case of a disease outbreak, all reports of sudden deaths and abortions in livestock should be reported to the nearest veterinary offices for action," he said.

[Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a per-acute or acute zoonotic disease of domestic ruminants. The virus is confined to the African continent and Arabian Peninsula. It is caused by a single serotype of a mosquito-borne virus of the _Bunyaviridae_ family (genus _Phlebovirus_). The disease occurs in climatic conditions favouring the breeding of mosquito vectors and is characterised by abortion, neonatal mortality and liver damage. The disease is most severe in sheep, goats and cattle. Older non-pregnant animals, although susceptible to infection, are more resistant to clinical disease. There is considerable variation in the susceptibility to RVF of animals of different species. Camels usually have an inapparent infection with RVF virus (RVFV), but sudden mortality, neonatal mortality and abortion occur and abortion rates can be as high as in cattle.

Humans are susceptible to RVFV and are infected through contact with infected animal material (body fluids or tissues) or through bites from infected mosquitoes. RVFV has also caused serious infections in laboratory workers and must be handled with biosafety and biocontainment measures.

Rainfall facilitates mosquito eggs to hatch. _Aedes_ mosquitoes acquire the virus from feeding on infected animals, and may potentially vertically transmit the virus, so that new generations of infected mosquitoes may hatch from their eggs. This provides a potential mechanism for maintaining the virus in nature, as the eggs of these mosquitoes may survive for periods of up to several years in dry conditions. Once livestock is infected, a wide variety of mosquito species may act as the vector for transmission of RVFV and can spread the disease.

Low level RVF activity may take place during inter-epizootic periods. RVF should be suspected when exceptional flooding and subsequent abundant mosquito populations are followed by the occurrence of abortions, together with fatal disease marked by necrosis and hemorrhages in the liver that particularly affect newborn lambs, kids and calves, potentially concurrent with the occurrence of an influenza-like illness in farm workers and people handling raw meat.

The current wet season in East Africa has been characterized by heavy rains and flooding, which enhance suitable ecological conditions for RVF vectors' amplification, increasing the risk of RVF occurrence. Recent suitability maps for RVF vector amplification, produced by FAO, showed a suitability pattern very similar to the one observed during the period September 2006-December 2007, a period that was characterized by abnormal, heavy rains and flooding which were followed by a major epizootic and epidemic in the region (Kenya, Tanzania and Somali covered in ProMED-mail's posts presented in "See Also" section below).

RVF has been reported during recent months from Uganda, South Sudan and South Africa.

In Jan 2018, a single case in a Korean man residing in Gambia was diagnosed while he visited Senegal. The site of his exposure was not definitely established; Gambia is not regarded an RVF-endemic country, in difference with Senegal. The case was reported to the WHO (see 20180124.5582417). No increase of abortions or compatible signs of RVF in livestock have been reported by the Senegalese veterinary service during the investigations regarding this case.

Earlier (in mid Sep 2017), FAO had issued an alert to raise awareness about the risk of RVF vector amplification in Senegal, Mali, Mauritania and Niger. This was based on the observation of persistent heavy rains and floods during the wet season. Non-endemic regional countries, such as Nigeria, Chad, Cote D'Ivoire and Ghana, also showed wide areas at risk due to long, persistent heavy rains.

Kenya's authorities call to farmers to vaccinate their livestock, in particular cattle, goats and sheep, deserves to be listened to and be followed by immediate action, in all regional countries currently under similar climatic conditions. This will not only prevent serious financial losses, but is expected to protect the health of owners, their family members and others involved.
