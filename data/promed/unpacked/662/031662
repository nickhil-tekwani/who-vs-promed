Coffee experts have been deployed to check on coffee leaf rust
disease that has been reported in parts of Kenya's main coffee
producing areas in the past month, an official said Friday [26 Oct
2007]. Loise Njeru, managing director at the state-run Coffee Board
of Kenya, said the experts will be equipped with spraying machines
and will check on the situation and report back by the end of next week.

Farmers had earlier reported that the disease had been spotted in
some areas of Central Province, particularly in low altitude areas.
The disease later spread to even higher altitudes and to all growing
areas in Central and Eastern Provinces within a short period. "We
have sent our officers to the ground; they will inspect the whole of
Central, Eastern and North Eastern Provinces even where nothing has
been cited, since we are not leaving anything to chance," said Njeru.

Central Province alone accounts for 80 percent of the country's
overall output of arabica coffee. Coffee leaf rust is spread by wind
and rain from spores from lesions on the underside of the coffee plant.

The return of rains in Brazil has triggered anxiety among local
coffee producers and marketers with expectations of slumps in prices
of the commodity after a historic 2-month rally. Brazil is the
largest producer of coffee.

In Kenya, the effects of a shaky production in Brazil was greatly
felt, with prices of the commodity climbing to a 2-year high.
Locally, the impressive growth in prices was further boosted by
shortfalls in supply due to incidents of outbreaks of diseases such
as coffee berry disease (CBD) and coffee leaf rust (CLR) in key
growing areas of central Kenya.

Analysts, however, say a stagnation and a possible decline is now
expected in the prices of the commodity, as production in Brazil
gradually returns to normal. Experts said the current depressed
supply situation following the recent cold spell over most growing
areas and the incidents of CLR and CBD are likely to provide the
local market with some reprieve in that a strong demand would cushion
against sharp drops in prices.

[Two species of coffee are being grown commercially: _Coffea arabica_
(arabica or highland coffee) and _Coffea canephora_ (robusta or
lowland coffee). Arabica is usually preferred for its taste, but
robusta is also grown widely. Coffee was 1st planted in Kenya in 1893.

Coffee leaf rust (CLR; also called orange rust) is caused by the
fungus _Hemileia vastatrix_, one of the most feared pathogens to
coffee growers. The disease was observed in Sri Lanka in the 1860's
and within 10 years devastated the entire coffee industry. Since
then, the fungus has appeared in every coffee producing region except
Hawaii and has destroyed arabica coffee plantings in many countries,
including Sri Lanka, Ethiopia and Brazil. Some of these areas have
been replanted with CLR-resistant robusta varieties, and some areas
have switched to other crops (for example tea in Sri Lanka).

The disease is characterised by yellow-orange powdery lesions on the
abaxial surface of leaves, where it attacks through stomata; it
rarely occurs on stems or fruit. CLR spores are spread by wind and
rain from lesions on the underside of the leaves. Disease management
relies on the use of copper-based fungicides sprayed at 4-6 week
intervals during the rainy season. Rust-resistant cultivars exist,
but the crop is of poorer quality. 32 races of _H. vastatrix_ have
been detected, making it particularly difficult to establish durable
host resistance.

Coffee berry disease (also called green berry anthracnose) is caused
by the fungus _Colletotrichum kahawae_. CBD was 1st discovered in
Kenya in 1920 and still occurs only in Africa. The pathogen affects
flowers, immature coffee berries, and sometimes the beans of _Coffea
arabica_ only. Infected berries display dark sunken spots that spread
and coalesce into lesions. In severe cases, berry development is
arrested, resulting in mummified berries on the fruiting branch.
Infected berries are considered the major source of inoculum. Fungal
sporulation occurs under high humidity conditions, and wind-blown
rain or drops from tree tops are the main means of pathogen spread.

The disease has been responsible for the abandonment of coffee
growing in several districts of Kenya and Ethiopia. Serious losses of
up to 80 percent are not unusual. Disease management includes
cultural practices (such as good airflow to the plants, removing
affected berries, minimising stagnation of water), quarantine
practices, and periodic fungicide treatments. Some resistant host
cultivars exist, and more are being developed.

_Colletotrichum_ species have been reported from _Coffea_ species
wherever they are grown, causing anthracnose-like symptoms (spotting
and blackening of fruit). A virulent strain of _C. coffeanum_, a
species reported from Brazil at the end of the 19th century, was
considered the cause of CBD. However, _C. coffeanum_ is now presumed
to be a synonym of _C. gloeosporioides_ (current name _Glomerella
cingulata_), and the CBD pathogen has recently been re-classified as
the separate species _C. kahawae_.
