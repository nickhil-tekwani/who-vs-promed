Lao Thai Nam Corp of Dallas, TX is recalling Number One Sompa Salted Fish, because it has the potential to be contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_, a bacterium which can cause life-threatening illness or death. Consumers are warned not to use the product even if it does not look or smell spoiled.

Botulism, a potentially fatal form of food poisoning, can cause the following symptoms: general weakness, dizziness, double vision and trouble with speaking or swallowing. Difficulty in breathing, weakness of other muscles, abdominal distension and constipation may also be common symptoms. People experiencing these problems should seek immediate medical attention.

Number One Sompa Salted Fish was distributed in the state of Texas (Irving and Houston areas) through retail stores prior to 31 Mar 2014. Number One Sompa Salted Fish is contained in a clear, vacuum packaged pouch. The pouch contains red and black lettering with a fish logo on the left hand portion. The product is a 7-ounce package containing a whole processed Tin Foil Barb fish, UPC: 8 8433200019 4.

No illnesses have been reported to date. The potential for contamination was noted after a routine FDA inspection found that the process for the fish being manufactured was not correctly validated.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures that could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
