PHUKET TOWN: Reported cases of "severe diarrhea" among foreigners have
nearly doubled during the first seven months of 1998 compared to the same
period last year. Phuket Provincial Health Department officials said 121
patients were treated at government hospitals from January 1 through July
31, up from 64 cases during the same period in 1997. This year's total has
surpassed the number of cases recorded during all of 1997.
In July, the island's three public hospitals diagnosed 9 foreigners with
"severe diarrhea." While cases of "severe diarrhea" were on the increase,
reported cases of food poisoning among foreigners were down. Officials
reported 15 cases during the first seven months of this year, compared to
23 cases during the same period a year ago.
The provincial health department has been using surveillance teams to
collect food and water samples from stalls and fresh markets since the
beginning of the year to ensure safety as part of' its "Amazing Hygienic
Food" campaign.
Earlier this year, Thailand's Deputy Chief of Communicable Diseases, Dr
Nara Nakwatanakul, responded to media reports of a cholera outbreak linked
to noodle stalls at Bangkok's famed floating market. He said that El Tor
Ogawa, a _Vibrio cholerae_ biotype, had been classified by Thai health
authorities as "severe diarrhea" because it is not as severe as
"classical" cholera.
