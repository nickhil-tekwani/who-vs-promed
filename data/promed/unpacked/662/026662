AEDES ALBOPICTUS - BRAZIL
=========================
I used to work with vector control in Brazil and a good amount of time was
dedicated to Dengue control with various control districts.
I don't have scientific data on it but on anecdotical way my experience was
that Ae albopictus never turned out to be the threat it first inspired.
Although Ae albopictus is still monitored the Dengue outbreaks still occurring
in areas with Ae aegypti. There are some on going studies trying to prove Ae.
albopictus transmiting Dengue in Brazil but no conclusive results are
available as far as I know.
My perception of Ae albopictus in Brazil is very much the same we are
observing in Florida with it replacing Ae aegypti in country areas but not in
downtown city type of environment.
So as time went by I reduced my interest in Ae albopictus as a Dengue vector
though not discarting it as a danger.
I'll reinforce my attention on it from now on and if I find anything I'll post
it.
