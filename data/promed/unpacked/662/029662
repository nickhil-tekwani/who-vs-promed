Margaret Wegener wrote concerning the effects of heat and the cluster of
salmonella outbreaks in Victoria.
Some comments
1. Western Australia usually has more extremes of temperature than Victoria
hence animals are more likely to be adjusted to these changes whereas in
Victoria this was unusal. This adjustment is likely to occur in both
animals and the behaviour of humans handling meat.
2. Most (? all) of the outbreaks are related to pig meat - generally
Victoria's climate is suited to pig-farming and has a larger market to
support such farming (the majority of Australia's 19 million population
lives on the eastern seaboard). In Western Australia the smaller
south-western area is the most suitable for pig-farming and the least
susceptible to extremes of temperature. The market for pig meat is generally
smaller with only 1.5 million living on the western 1/3 of the continent.
(For those whose geography has long since passed its use by date Australia
is about the same size as the US minus Alaska!)
3. Like most outbreaks there are likely to be a group of explanations to
explain what is going on - however - we know that there is a cluster of
outbreaks, in a small period of time, all related to meat, all involving
salmonella and all occurring in a (relatively) small state - if it was JUST
food handling regulation we would expect to see a greater diversity of
organisms and culprit food-stuffs. [It was noticeable that the Salmonella
serotypes involved were those commonly associated with animal feedstuffs.
But how salmonella feed contamination occurs is not always simple as it can
involve events both in the manufacturing process as well as how the feed is
handled on the farm and fed to the stock. MHJ]
4. Older literature (and not refuted to my knowledge) from the 50s and 60s
documented the quite marked increases in salmonellae following heat stress.
(eg see Topley & Wilson)[Two very useful publications covering this are the
World Meteorological Technical Notes ... #190 "Weather, Climate, and Animal
Performance" and #190 "Animal Health and Production at Extremes of Weather".
MHJ]
5. Australia's salmonella notification rates show a marked north/south
distribution with much higher rates occurring in the hotter north. (This is
partly but not wholly accounted for by differences in ethnicity of the
population)
What I suspect is that 'glitches' occur in food handling throughout the
world - if behaviour takes this into account (for example cooking meat well,
no cross-contamination between cooked and uncooked meat etc) then we rarely
suffer disease - on the other hand if the glitches occur in the context of
increased levels of contamination such as probably occurred in Victoria,
then human outbreaks occur. If this is added to improved methods for
identifying clusters of disease with the advent of computer technology,
progress in microbiology, better epidemiological investigation etc (all of
which have occurred in Victoria) then we know about the outbreaks, and can
identify the source food/supplier.

In olden days when I was young hot weather tended to mean that food could
get quite hot if left out, even briefly. What it might do in a car beggars
belief. I do somewhat fear that forever blaming shops, manufacturing or
farms might be overlooking what happens to the food between shop and mouth.
We avoid blaming (or educating) the public at their peril.
I am also old enough to remember the removal of many (all?) preservatives
from foods due to health scares. At the time food technologists warned of
the danger of increased infections of food borne pathogens. Sometimes I
cannot help but believe they may have had a point.
