The death toll due to the Japanese encephalitis [JE] epidemic
among children in Andhra Pradesh has reached 201, according to
government statistics.
Director of Health K S V Prasada Rao, in a health bulletin, said that
7 more cases were reported on Tuesday, raising the year's total to
963 cases.
The death toll during 1998 was 201 when 524 cases were
reported, according to departmental statistics.
Rao said that 275 medical teams and 1250 para-medical teams
have been working in the 711 affected villages. He said 62 000
doses of JE vaccine have been distributed in the affected districts.
To contain the [virus], the district authorities have taken several
steps. The measures include segregating pigs from human
habitations, ensuring better sanitation, covering open drains,
clearing shrubs and drains, undertaking fogging operations to
check mosquito breeding, etc. The district authorities have also
launched awareness campaigns in all areas prone to the disease.

[Although the probability that this is a Japanese encephalitis
epidemic is high, we have yet to see any confirmatory evidence
that this is the case. Fewer than 30 samples have been tested, &
only 16 of them had antibody to JE virus. If that is all the test
results there are, there has been no laboratory confirmation that
this is a JE epidemic, only presumptive evidence. When all is said
and done, the final tallies will go into health department reports and
chapter tables but will not be reliable. Such is the way of
international health statistics. - Mod.CHC]
