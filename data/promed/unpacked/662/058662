Virus spreading alarm and deadly pig disease in China
------------------------------------------------------------
A highly infectious swine virus is sweeping China's pig population,
driving up pork prices and creating fears of a global pandemic among
domesticated pigs. Animal virus experts say Chinese authorities are
playing down the gravity and spread of the disease.
So far, the mysterious virus -- believed to cause an unusually deadly
form of an infection known as blue-ear pig disease -- has spread to
25 of this country's 33 provinces and regions, prompting a pork
shortage and the strongest inflation in China in a decade.
More than that, China's past lack of transparency -- particularly
over what became the SARS epidemic -- has created global concern.
"They haven't really explained what this virus is," says Federico A.
Zuckermann, a professor of immunology at the University of Illinois
College of Veterinary Medicine. "This is like SARS. They haven't sent
samples to any international body. This is really irresponsible of
China. This thing could get out and affect everyone."
There are no clear indications that blue-ear disease -- if that is
what this disease is -- poses a threat to human health. Though the
Chinese government acknowledges that the current virus has devastated
pig stocks in coastal and southern areas, it has not admitted what
experts say is clear: the virus is rapidly moving inland and
westward, to areas such as this one in Sichuan Province, China's
largest pork-producing region.
"This disease is like a wind that swept in and passed from village to
village," said Ding Shurong, a 45-year-old farmer in a village near
here who lost two-thirds of his pigs . "I've never seen anything like
it. No family was left untouched."
No one knows for sure how many of this country's 500 million pigs
have been infected. The government says officially that about 165 000
pigs have contracted the virus this year [2007]. But in a country
that, on average, loses 25 million pigs a year to disease, few
believe the figures. In part, the skepticism comes from the fact that
pork prices have skyrocketed 85 percent in the last year -- an
increase that, absent other factors, suggests the losses from disease
are more widespread than Beijing admits.
And there are other signs. Field experts are reporting widespread
disease outbreaks. Fear among pig farmers that their livestock will
contract the disease has led to panic selling. And the government and
media here have issued alarming reports that farmers are selling
diseased or infected pigs to illegal slaughterhouses, which could
pose food safety problems.
International health experts are already calling this one of the
worst disease outbreaks ever to hit Asia's livestock industry, and
they fear the fast-mutating pathogens could spread to neighboring
countries, igniting a worldwide epidemic that could affect pork
supplies everywhere.
A similar virus has already been detected in neighboring Vietnam and
Myanmar, and health experts are trying to determine if it came from
China.
Health experts say China has declined to send tissue samples to
testing labs outside the country for independent verification by a
lab affiliated with the World Organization for Animal Health in
Paris. The Chinese government says that it has reported the disease
to international health bodies and insists that the disease is under
control and that a vaccine has been developed and distributed.
But some scientists say there is no truly effective vaccine against
blue-ear pig disease (which is also known as porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome); other experts say they are not even certain
that the blue-ear virus is the one that is spreading. Scientists who
track blue-ear pig disease are puzzled because the disease is
generally not so deadly.
"This virus generally makes them ill but on its own it doesn't cause
a lot of deaths," said Steven McOrist, a professor of pig medicines
at the University of Nottingham in England. "The evidence they put up
so far is not conclusive."
If it is blue-ear pig disease, which has infected most parts of the
world, including the United States, it may be a new and more virulent
strain.
"This is more severe than we've seen elsewhere," said Derek
Armstrong, a senior veterinary scientist at the Meat and Livestock
Commission in Britain. "It may be a co-infection of pigs with other
things."
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO] is now
pressing China to share its research and tissue samples.
"I've asked my two vets in Beijing to work with the government and
get some of those samples out," said Juan Lubroth, head of infectious
disease at the FAO, noting that China has reported its own findings
on the disease. "Our experience has shown us that working with
carrots is better than working with sticks."
Government scientists themselves said that last year the virus
affected two millions pigs and killed 400 000. Here in Sichuan
province, home to some 55 million pigs and one of the world's most
densely populated pig breeding areas, there is devastation. Many pig
farmers say that what appears to be the blue-ear virus swept through
this region in June and July [2007, killing thousands of pigs.
"First they refused to eat, then they got high fever," said Zhao
Yanjun, 32, who lost all but 5 of his 150 pigs, just months after
building a modern barn in Heishi village, about an hour's drive
southwest of Chengdu. "Now, there's nothing left."
Liu Minghong, a 38-year-old farmer, said, "Most of my pigs got hit in
June and July -- 70 of them died." sitting in a dusty house on the
edge of his property, He pulled out a notepad that cataloged the
demise of his pigs. "I sold a lot out of panic," he says.
Pig farmers who did not sell watched their pigs succumb to a disease
that ate away at their insides in a matter of weeks, often turning
the pig's ear blue. In Mr. Liu's barn, he pointed to one pig that was
little more than a skeleton, shivering in a corner, struggling for
life.
Now, slaughterhouses here go wanting.
"Last year we slaughtered 1000 pigs a day; now we're doing 100," said
Yuan Zi, a manager at the Qiyuan Meal slaughterhouse near the city of
Qionglai. "We've laid off nearly half the staff."
Officials in Beijing worry that widespread pork shortages and soaring
food prices could prompt panic, unrest or inflation, undermining a
sizzling economy. Trying to contain the damage, the government has
announced a series of emergency measures, offering aid, incentives
and free vaccines to farmers. But the government has also warned
against price gouging, and vowed to crack down on farmers selling
diseased pigs, or injecting a pig with water to bolster its selling
weight.
Still, many here say the problem is that pigs are simply in short
supply, and it may take months if not a year or two to restock
supplies, assuming the disease does not linger, as some scientists
say it generally does. Many experts, meanwhile, worry that China,
which the FAO says is the 4th-largest exporter of live and
slaughtered hogs, could already be exporting the disease.
"This is already considered to be a threat to the global industry,"
said Trevor Drew, head of virology at the Veterinary Laboratories
Agency in Weybridge, in southeast England. "It would be naive to
think we could contain this virus."

High Fever Disease is Not Only blue ear disease
--------------------------------------------------------------
At the "Pig Diesase Prevention & Control Techniques and Grasp the
Chance for Rapid Growth Symposium," sponsored by the National Feed
Engineering Technology Research Center and Guangzhou Feed Office,
Professor Hanchun Yang of China Agricultural University pointed out
that "High Fever Disease" does not equal blue ear disease. [Rather,]
"High Fever Disease" equals blue ear disease [plus] Hog Cholera or
PCV2 infection or mycoplasmal pneumonia [plus] secondary bacterial
infection.
Professor Yang believes that the primary illness of "High Fever
Disease," which has broken out across a vast area of China during
these 2 years, is blue ear disease. But analysis has shown that this
blue ear disease strain, when compared to classic blue ear disease
strain, lacks a total of 30 amino acids. Moreover, the source of the
strain is unclear. Is it a natural disaster or man-made disaster? No
one knows. This disease has spread across a vast area of China, even
in Ningxia. And such a high mortality rate is mainly due to the
existence of multiple mixed infection with other pathogens, as well
as very serious secondary bacterial infections. The main pathogens of
the multiple mixed infection are Hog Cholera Virus, PCV2, mycoplasmal
pneumonia. The main pathogens of secondary bacterial infection are
_Haemophilus parasuis_, _E. coli_, _Streptococcus suis_ type 2,
Salmonella, Toxigenic _Pasteurella multocida_, Eperythrozoon, etc.
Turning to the prevention and control of "High Fever Disease",
Professor Yang believes there are mainly 3 types of situations: pig
farms which have not experienced outbreaks, pig farms which had
outbreaks, and pig farms [currently] experiencing outbreaks.
For a farm that has not experienced outbreaks, the main requirements
relate to biological safety measures for the farm itself, including
strengthening disinfection in the pig farm's environment, restricting
the movement of personnel, prohibiting unauthorized personnel from
entering the pig farm, thorough disinfection of hauling vehicles
entering the pig farm, and breaking all possible routes of
transmission. In addition, they should:
- Cease introductions from areas or farms with outbreaks and apply
strict inspection;
- Manage pig herds with utmost attention and use some nutritional
additives toincrease the resistance of pig herds;
- Make proper use of medicinal prophylaxis and health maintenance
for pig herds;
- Control secondary infections in pig herds; and
- Immunize pig herds against Hog Cholera, mycoplasmal pneumonia, PRV
[Pseudorabies, Aujeszky's disease].
Professor Yang did not wish to assess the live and inactivated blue
ear disease vaccines now being promoted, and stressed that actual
practice is the sole standard for testing truth.
For those pig farms which have experienced outbreaks, strengthen pig
disinfection, reduce the infection rate of PRRSV in the pig herd and
strengthen control of secondary infections. Emphasis should be placed
on control of _Haemophilus parasuis_, Streptococcus, _E. coli_, and
other secondary infections.
For those farms where an outbreak is occurring, disinfection must be
strengthened, affected pig sheds closed, personnel movement limited,
and other measures taken to prevent expansion of the outbreak.
Promptly isolate sick pigs. Dead pigs should be buried or burned for
safe disposal to prevent spread of pathogens. In sick pig herds,
antipyretics, antibiotics and other drugs should not be used in the
early stage. It is recommended to use Chinese medicinal preparations
and add electrolytes and vitamins to drinking water. After a week,
controlling secondary infections and reducing deaths is the focal
point. Add Guangdong Galloper Veterinary Pharmaceutical Company's
"Antai" and other dissolvable Western-Chinese medicines to drinking
water, [administer] injectable cephalasporins. Immunizations should
be suspended in sick pig herds. Porcine [anti]serum can be used to
treat sick pigs (at least 30-days post-illness porcine serum; each
pig 5ml, twice a day for 2 days with injection into muscle or
abdomen). For control of secondary infections, Ceftiofur injections
(at 3, 7, 21, 28, 35, and 42 days old) can be used with sucklings and
weaners. In addition, antibiotics (such as "Jiakang" [contains
Thiamphenicol], Tiamulin, Oxytetracycline, Chlortetracycline,
Doxycycline, Amoxicillin) may be added to feed or water.
Professor Hanchun Yang's presentation met with the approval and
appreciation of many in the audience and society experts. At the
symposium, Dr. Changxu Song of the Guangdong Academy of Agricultural
Sciences' Veterinary Medicine Institute explained how to set up
effective biological safety measures to prevent and control epidemic
diseases. Yangcai Lin, vice director of the Institute of Animal
Science of Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences, explained how
to increase the immune function of animals through nutritional
controls.

[The lecture of Prof. Yang deserves careful reading, especially in
relation to 2 salient issues: the multifactorial nature of the
syndrome and the (possible) role of vaccines.
The involvement of numerous disease agents may be indicative of an
immunosuppressive primary pathogen. Such effect by the PRRS virus has
been discussed in the past (e.g., Done, S. H., and D. J. Paton. 1995.
Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome: clinical disease,
pathology and immunosuppression. Vet. Rec. 136:32-35).
Prof Yang's question "Is it a natural disaster or man-made disaster?"
and his reluctance to assess the promoted live and inactivated blue
ear disease vaccines, stressing "that actual practice is the sole
standard for testing truth", are appreciated and intriguing. One
interpretation may lead to a theoretical hypothesis that vaccines may
have played some role, either by default or otherwise, in the
evolution of this major epizootic. Such a possibility deserves
consideration and, possibly, further investigation.
The control upon the manufacture of animal vaccines in China, their
testing requirements and their licensing and certification
procedures, as well as the control upon their application, has been
subject to discussions and concern in the past. One example was the
Taiwan 1997 outbreak of FMD, suspected to be connected with an
attenuated live vaccine virus used in China (see ROYAL SOCIETY
INQUIRY INTO INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN LIVESTOCK, 2002
<http://www.royalsociety.org/document.asp?tip=1&id=1392>). - Mod.AS]
