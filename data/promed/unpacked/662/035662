New York Times Reporter in Rio Was Sent Anthrax Letter
----------------------------------------------
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York Times said on Friday a letter sent to its
Rio de Janeiro bureau had tested positive for "bacteria or spores
consistent with anthrax." The letter, which the Times said in a statement
was mailed from New York City, postmarked Oct. 5 and received at the bureau
on Oct. 16, "suggested bacteria or spores consistent with anthrax" after a
preliminary test, according to Brazilian authorities. If confirmed, it
would be among the first anthrax-tainted letters received outside of the
United States, and would make the Times the latest in a slew of media
targets for anthrax attacks.
An employee at the bureau headed by correspondent Larry Rohter became
suspicious because the letter had no return address. It was turned over
unopened to Brazilian authorities.
All 4 Times employees at the bureau were tested for anthrax and given
antibiotics as a precaution, but test results had not been received, the
Times said.
A spokeswoman at the Rio de Janeiro biological research laboratory Fiocruz
said that the lab had received the letter sent to the Times and was testing
the contents, but that "the tests are not conclusive" as yet.
Employees at the newspaper's Manhattan office said Managing Editor Gerald
Boyd had made an announcement about the letter on Friday. An e-mail signed
by 6 top Times executives and read to Reuters said the letter was put into
a plastic bag before being sent to authorities.
No other details were available.
Earlier on Friday The New York Post said a female employee had tested
positive for skin anthrax, and New Jersey officials said a second postal
worker also had a confirmed case in the seventh and eighth confirmed U.S.
cases of anthrax. "Last night New York Post officials were informed by the
New York Police Department that one of our employees has tested positive
for cutaneous anthrax,'' a less dangerous form of the disease than inhaled
anthrax, the Post said in a statement.
The infected employee is a female member of the support staff for the
editorial page who is back at work and is expected to make a "swift and
complete recovery,'' it said.
In Washington 28 congressional staffers have tested positive for exposure
to anthrax since the bacteria was found on Monday in a letter mailed to
Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota.

In Argentina, the health minister confirmed Friday that a letter sent to
a Buenos Aires family from the United States has tested positive for
anthrax. The letter was sent from Miami, Florida, with a return address for
Carnival Cruise Lines, the minister said. So far, the one person in the
family who handled the letter has tested negative for anthrax.
