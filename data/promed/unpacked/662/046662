"Wild birds play important roles in the circulation of avian influenza viruses and are reservoirs for low pathogenicity strains. In general, avian influenza viruses in wild birds can be transmitted to and from poultry, and potentially to and from other domestic animals and people. In order to reduce health risks to wildlife, domestic animals and people, it is important to understand all aspects of the circulation of the broad range of avian influenza viruses among susceptible populations: wild animals, domestic animals and humans.

"The majority of wild bird migration across Europe, Africa and Asia subsides in November for the winter season. While wintering locations of these migratory birds are often stable, additional movement within a region may be affected by local weather conditions, food resources, access to open water, etc.

"Strategic wild-bird surveillance planning and enhanced messaging to poultry farmers to strengthen biosecurity practices before spring migration is warranted, especially if the virus persists over the winter in Europe, North America, and East Asia. Detections in indoor poultry farms where direct contact with wild birds has been considered negligible emphasize indirect transmission to these production sectors from contaminated environments via fomites or by air, further highlighting the ability of these viruses to persist in the natural environment". - Mod.CRD
