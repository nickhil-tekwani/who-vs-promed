Outbreak investigation of _Salmonella_ Enteritidis: bagged peaches (August 2020)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The FDA, along with CDC and state and local partners, is investigating a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella_ Enteritidis infections potentially linked to bagged peaches sold at ALDI stores in multiple states. The peaches are in Wawona-brand 2-pound, clear plastic bags sold in ALDI stores from 1 Jun 2020 until present. Based on information collected from ill persons, CDC has identified bagged peaches from ALDI stores as a likely source of _Salmonella_ Enteritidis infections. As of 19 Aug 2020, CDC is reporting a total of 68 cases across 9 states.

Case counts
------------
Total illnesses: 68
Hospitalizations: 14
Deaths: 0
Last illness onset date: 3 Aug 2020

State / No. ill people
Iowa / 8
Maryland / 1

Minnesota / 23
New Jersey / 4
New York / 8
Pennsylvania / 1
Virginia / 3
Wisconsin / 3

Total 68

Product distribution*: CT, IA, IL, KY, MA, MI, MN, ND, NH, NY, OH, RI, SD, VT, WI, WV
*Distribution has been confirmed for states listed, but the product could have been distributed further, reaching additional states

FDA's traceback investigation is ongoing to determine the full scope of product distribution and source of contamination. More information will be shared when it is available.

As of 19 Aug 2020, ALDI has voluntarily recalled all of Wawona-brand bagged peaches from select ALDI stores in multiple states and is continuing to participate in FDA investigation efforts to determine the source of contamination.

Recommendations
-----------------
Advice for consumers, restaurants, and retailers: Consumers, restaurants, and retailers should not eat, sell, or serve Wawona-brand bagged peaches from ALDI stores in multiple states. Consumers who purchased Wawona-brand bagged peaches from ALDI stores from 1 Jun 2020 to present and may still have them in their house should not eat the peaches and should throw them away. Consumers who purchased Wawona-brand bagged peaches from ALDI stores from 1 Jun 2020 to present and froze them should throw them away. Consumers who purchased bagged peaches from ALDI stores from 1 Jun 2020 to present and cannot identify the brand, should throw the peaches away.

FDA recommends that anyone who received Wawona-brand bagged peaches from ALDI use extra vigilance in cleaning and sanitizing any surfaces and containers that may have come in contact with the produce to reduce the risk of cross-contamination. This includes cutting boards, slicers, countertops, refrigerators, and storage bins.

Consumers who have symptoms of _Salmonella_ infection should contact their health care provider. Most people with salmonellosis develop diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps. More severe cases of salmonellosis may include a high fever, aches, headaches, lethargy, a rash, blood in the urine or stool, and in some cases may become fatal.

Suppliers and distributors: Suppliers, distributors, and others in the supply chain should not use, ship, or sell Wawona-brand bagged peaches from ALDI. Suppliers and distributors that re-packaged Wawona-brand bagged peaches from ALDI from 1 Jun 2020 to present should use extra vigilance in cleaning and sanitizing any surfaces and storage areas that may have come into contact with Wawona-brand bagged peaches from ALDI stores. If there has been potential cross contamination or mixing of peaches from other sources with these products, then comingled products should be discarded.

Investigation update
--------------------
The FDA, along with CDC and state and local partners, is investigating a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella_ Enteritidis infections. State officials from the Minnesota Department of Health reported that many of the people sick with the same strain of _S._ Enteritidis, confirmed by Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS), had purchased Wawona-brand bagged peaches from ALDI prior to becoming ill.

In response to FDA investigators, ALDI reported to FDA that potentially affected bagged peaches were shipped to CT, IA, IL, KY, MA, MI, MN, ND, NH, NY, OH, RI, SD, VT, WI, and WV. ALDI also reported to FDA that the sole supplier of the bagged peaches to stores reported by cases during the timeframe of interest was Wawona Packing Company, LLC. FDA's traceback investigation is ongoing to identify the source of this outbreak and to determine if potentially contaminated product has been shipped to additional retailers.

[Peaches grow on trees and as such are less susceptible to contamination while growing as a melon would be growing on the ground. A PubMed search did not reveal any reported outbreaks but as seen in this publication, contamination may be found and may not necessarily be acquired in packing facilities.

Abstract
--------
Automated fruit sorting systems with individual fruit carriers are utilized in modern fruit packing facilities. This study evaluated the levels of naturally occurring microflora on the surfaces of peaches and fruit carriers during automated sorting operations at stone fruit packinghouses in California. The study also assessed the growth potential of _Salmonella enterica_ and _Listeria monocytogenes_ on fruit carriers under various environmental conditions. No difference of microbial loads was found on peaches (n = 420) before, during, and after fruit sorting at seven packinghouses. The average surface total microbial, coliform, and yeast and mold levels of peaches during sorting were 3.6, 2.7, and 1.9 log CFU/cm2, respectively. Environmental swab testing indicated routine cleaning of fruit carriers (n = 192) reduced total microbes from 3.9 to 3.2 log CFU/cm2 (P = 0.003) and coliforms from 1.5 to 0.9 log CFU/cm2 (P = 0.001) on carriers' fruit contact surfaces. Laboratory exposures to temperature (22, 28, 34, or 40 deg C) [71.6, 82.4, 93.2, 104 deg F] and humidity (65, 75, 85 or 95%) conditions significantly reduced inoculated _Salmonella_ and _Listeria_ on clean and commercially used (deposited with wax, fuzz, dirt, etc.) fruit carriers within 24 h (P less than 0.001). The observed _Salmonella_ reduction was greater on clean carriers (P less than 0.001). On used carriers, _Salmonella_ was persistent at 95% humidity and _Listeria_ was persistent at 22 deg C [71.6 deg F]. The results showed the levels of surface microflora on peaches during fruit sorting, the reduction of microbial loads on fruit carriers due to packinghouses' cleaning, and the reduction, rather than growth, of _Salmonella_ and _Listeria_ under tested conditions on fruit carriers. - Mod.LL
