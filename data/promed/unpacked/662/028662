As many as 673 people had been affected by anthrax and 53 of them died since the year 2000 in Koraput district. Health Minister Atanu Sabyasachi Nayak informed this in the Assembly in response to a question of Congress MLA Tara Prasad Bahinipati on Friday [5 May 2016].

The disease spread by animals is transmitted to humans, and if treatment is done at initial stages, the patients get cured fully, the Minister said.

The Chief District Medical Officers (CDMOs) of anthrax-affected districts have been provided guidelines for treatment and prevention of the disease. They have been asked to send doctors' teams to the affected areas and provide treatment and medicines free of cost, the Minister said.

[Anthrax is enzootic in Odisha in over half the districts in the state with significant numbers of animal cases each time. Not just one dead cow per outbreak, e.g., in 2007 there were 10 outbreaks involving 65 cattle and 4 sheep & goats, in 2008 5 outbreaks and 56 cattle affected, in 2009 4 outbreaks and 36 cattle affected, in 2010 10 outbreaks and 32 cattle, and so on. And when the owners of these sick cattle butcher them, family, friends, neighbours and folk buying the meat in the market are at a significant risk. A structured program for anthrax control & surveillance in Koraput and the whole state of Odisha is long overdue. Sterne vaccine is extraordinarily cheap and very effective in preventing livestock outbreaks. Live cattle are more profitable than dead ones so the owners are happy. Medics cannot prevent anthrax outbreaks. This is the responsibility of the veterinary services.
