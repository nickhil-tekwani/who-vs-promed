Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever Spread South To Masindi By Absconding Patient
---------------------------------------------------------------------
KAMPALA: A Ugandan woman unwittingly spread the Ebola hemorrhagic fever
epidemic after fleeing a hospital at the center of the outbreak in a
desperate attempt to escape infection by the virus, officials said on Mon
13 Nov 2000. The patient had been receiving treatment for a different
illness in St Mary's Hospital at Lacor, close to the town of Gulu. When she
learned there was Ebola fever in Lacor, she ran away, said Sam Okware,
Uganda's Commissioner For Health Services. But it now appears she was
already infected with Ebola virus - which in many cases leads to massive
internal bleeding, shock, and eventually death. The disease has killed at
least 109 people [3 more than reported by WHO as of Sun 12 Nov 2000 in the
latest outbreak.
The woman died and unknowingly passed Ebola virus to relatives in her home
village in Masindi district, 120 km (75 miles) south of Gulu. Her daughter
and another dependant in the house also died, and the husband of the
daughter is now in hospital, Okware said. Ebola fever experts from the
Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that
blood samples from the woman's son-in-law had tested positive for Ebola
virus. He has been isolated in hospital near his home village. The outbreak
began early in October and spread late last month to the southern
commercial town of Mbarara, where 4 people have died. A total of 19 new
suspected cases have been admitted to hospitals in Gulu since Friday.

the second occasion recently when the virus has escaped from the
containment area around Gulu. - Mod.CP
