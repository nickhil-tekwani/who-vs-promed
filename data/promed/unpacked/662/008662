The measles epidemic extends beyond Bolivar state, authorities of the Single Institute of Health of the state Monagas reported on [Thu 23 Nov 2017] that the entity has registered - until the epidemiological week number 45 - 29 cases of suspect measles [From August to October 2017, the WHO reported 84 suspected cases with 34 confirmed. - Mod.LK]

According to El Pitazo, the week from [5 to 11 Nov 2017], 5 people were reported with symptoms of rubella. This was indicated by the director of Regional Epidemiology, Luis Jiménez, who explained that all the cases that have fever and eruptions are considered suspicious according to the health protocol of the MOH, reviewed the newspaper El Sol de Oriente.

A total of 15 of the suspected cases with measles were registered in the municipalities Maturin, Cedeño, Libertador, Santa Bárbara and Sotillo. Meanwhile, patients with possible diagnosis of rubella were reported in the areas of Community Integral Health (Asic) of the municipality Ezequiel Zamora and Maturin.

[Around 1 million unvaccinated Venezuelan children are susceptible to measles, a highly contagious disease that has re-emerged in the crisis-stricken South American nation, a group of doctors estimated [in October 2017].

A crippling shortage of medicines and vaccines, as well as decaying hospitals and an exodus of doctors has thrown Venezuela's health sector into a tailspin. Amid the crisis, once-controlled diseases like diphtheria and measles have returned to the fore, putting Venezuela's 30 million people at risk and raising the threat of contagion beyond its borders.

[Two Venezuelan public health organizations] identified a suboptimal vaccination coverage, and on a national level [it was] estimated that at least 1 150 000 children under the age of 1 were not vaccinated... over the last 10 years," the report added.

Ana Carvajal, a doctor and one of the authors of the report, told Reuters the estimate is based on data obtained through sources at the Health Ministry and WHO figures.

The WHO has said it is helping with the purchase and delivery of some 7.2 million vaccines against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) in Venezuela and hopes to spread the drive across the country.

As Venezuela's medical crisis has worsened, the Health Ministry has largely kept mum and no longer publishes a weekly bulletin that includes data on infant mortality or mosquito-borne diseases like malaria.

Measles deaths dropped around 79 percent between 2000 and 2015 globally thanks to vaccinations, according to the WHO.

But gaps in coverage have lead to several measles outbreaks in Europe in the past year, officials said in April [2017], with lack of trust leading people to turn down potentially life-saving vaccines.

[2] US (Colorado): cost of infection

https://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2017/11/25/just-two-measles-cases-cost-taxpayers-68192-in-colorado/#1b91858c7107


Even when infectious diseases don't cause long-term serious harm, they cost money. When that disease is a serious, extremely contagious vaccine-preventable disease like measles, the costs run into tens of thousands of dollars - which come straight from taxpayers' pockets.

Most diseases that can be prevented by vaccines are "notifiable diseases," which means health care providers and local officials are legally required to report cases so that the government can track and respond to outbreaks and prevent further infections.

So aside from the cost of health care and lost productivity from missing work and school, notifiable diseases cost money for local, state and sometimes national officials to interview those infected, identify all others exposed to the disease, and take measures to prevent the disease from spreading.

In the case of 2 unrelated measles cases in Denver, Colorado between July 2016 and January 2017, the public funds needed for response, surveillance and disease control totaled USD 68 192. The cost included personnel and supply costs in Colorado's Tri-County Health Department for Adams, Arapahoe, and Douglas counties.

"Each case resulted in multiple exposures at health care facilities and public venues, and activated an immediate and complex response by local and state public health agencies," wrote Grace E. Marx, MD, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Epidemic Intelligence Service, and her coauthors.

In both cases, the people with measles had traveled to countries where measles is still regularly circulating. Measles is no longer endemic, or regularly circulating on its own, in the US and in all of the Americas. But cases can still be imported and lead to serious outbreaks, such as at Disneyland several years ago and in Minnesota last year [2016]. Most people who get sick during these outbreaks are unvaccinated.

The 1st case was a 14-month-old boy who contracted measles during a 3-month visit to India. He was unvaccinated even though the CDC recommends infants old get the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine before overseas travel if they're at least 6 months old. During the time he was infectious, from 8--16 July 2016, a total of 283 people were exposed to his infection at 8 locations, including 3 health care facilities, an apartment building and a children's math and reading center.

Although 83 percent of those people were fully vaccinated, nearly all those who weren't had to receive treatment to prevent infection (post-exposure prophylaxis). No additional cases occurred, though one 8-month-old infant who required vaccination developed a rash and fever from the vaccine. The total cost of the public health response was USD 49 769.

The 2nd case was a 33-year-old man in Denver who contracted measles in Thailand during travel from 20 Nov--14 Dec 2016. While infectious, he visited 17 businesses and 2 health care facilities, exposing 232 people. Again, no additional infections occurred, but the public health response totaled USD 18 423. The cost was lower because reporting to public health authorities was delayed, which made post-exposure prophylaxis no longer an effective option.

"Even a single case of measles can cause substantial economic and personnel burden to public health systems," wrote the authors. "This burden can be decreased by improving measles-mumps-rubella vaccination rates, increasing timely reporting of suspected or confirmed measles cases, and optimizing coordinated public health response."

The authors cited previous measles infections whose public health responses cost from USD 5655 -- USD 181 679 for personnel, tracing all exposed persons and administering postexposure prophylaxis.

"In addition to the direct costs from personnel hours, these investigations place considerable burden on public health agencies," the authors wrote. "Reprioritization of public health programming during these urgent investigations has the potential to cause delay in delivering other necessary public health services."

[The cost of treating infectious disease cases and preventing further spread can be astronomical. On the other hand, "Vaccination is one of the most cost-effective and successful public health interventions. Each year, vaccines save an estimated 6 to 9 million lives worldwide, including the lives of 3 million children. In the United States, vaccinations have decreased most vaccine-preventable childhood diseases by more than 95 percent. Vaccines have minimized or eliminated outbreaks of certain diseases that were once lethal to large numbers of people, including measles and polio in the United States and smallpox worldwide. But because the bacteria and viruses that cause diseases still exist, the public health gains achieved through vaccines can only be maintained by ensuring that vaccination rates remain high enough to prevent outbreaks. When vaccinated people in a given population increase, the likelihood that a susceptible person will come into contact with an infected person decreases; it ultimately becomes difficult for a disease to maintain a chain of infection. Although the vaccination rate required to achieve herd immunity varies by vaccine, it typically ranges from 80 percent to 95 percent of a given population.

"Herd immunity is critical for protecting the health of many groups of people who are especially vulnerable to communicable diseases: those who cannot be vaccinated, either because they are too young or because an immunological condition makes vaccination too risky; those who choose--or whose parents choose for them--not to get vaccinated for nonmedical reasons such as religious or personal beliefs; and those who have been vaccinated but whose immunological response is insufficient to protect them from potential infection."

The rise in the number of measles cases in Greece has forced the Center for Disease Prevention and Control (KEELPNO) to issue a warning. The center says that since May [2017], when the 1st cases of the epidemic appeared, there have been 524 cases recorded through [Thu 23 Nov 2017].

The majority of measles cases have been recorded in Attica and the Peloponnese, and mainly among Roma children who have not been vaccinated.

"We cannot rule out an escalation in cases or the epidemic spreading to other geographical areas," KEELPNO told Kathimerini newspaper.

Other than Roma children, some health workers who had not been vaccinated came down with the measles.

KEELPNO advises all parents to get their children vaccinated and suggests the same to health workers.

Health chiefs have issued an urgent warning as they confirmed 9 children have contracted measles in the city [Birmingham]. Parents are being urged to ensure their family has had vaccinations in the wake of the outbreak of the highly infectious illness.

The disease can lead to serious chest infections, ear infections, brain swelling and, in some cases, brain damage. Younger children are particularly vulnerable but anyone with weakened immune systems - such as cancer patients - are also at risk.

People are being urged to stay at home and contact their GP or NHS 111 for advice if they suspect they could be suffering from measles.

"Measles is a highly infectious viral illness. If you think you could have measles, it is really important to stay away from areas where you could come into contact with lots of other people - especially vulnerable patients in hospitals, care homes or other settings."

Measles has been eliminated in UK, say global health leaders "It is possible for anyone at any age to get measles and the illness can be more severe in teenagers and adults than in young children."

Public Health England (PHE) has reported an increase in measles across the country over the year [2017].

Dr Sibal added: "The free MMR vaccine is a safe and effective way of protecting against measles, as well as mumps and rubella. It's particularly important for parents to take up the offer of MMR vaccination for their children when offered at 1 year of age and as a pre-school booster at 3 years, 4 months of age. If children and young adults have missed these vaccinations in the past, it's important to take up the vaccine now from GPs, particularly in light of the recent cases in Birmingham."

Last year [2016] outbreaks were reported in the South West of England and London, while earlier this month [November 2017] outbreaks were reported in Dublin and Meath in Ireland.

All of the cases are in children and young adults who haven't received the MMR vaccine with health officials advising anyone who missed the jab to visit their GP.

The warning comes despite global health chiefs declaring measles had been 'eliminated' in the UK in September this year [2017].

Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, said in September [2017]: "We are delighted that the World Health Organisation has confirmed that the UK achieved measles elimination in 2016 and that rubella elimination continues to be sustained."

Measles symptoms to be aware of include: high fever; sore, red, watery eye; coughing; aching and feeling generally unwell; a blotchy red brown rash, which usually appears after the initial symptoms.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on [Mon 20 Nov 2017] that 507 suspected cases of measles were reported from the 20 local government areas of Bauchi State between January and October 2017.

The organisation's Measles Consultant, Dr Bezu Beshir, made the disclosure at the 2017 sensitisation meeting on measles campaign with journalists in Bauchi. He said "507 suspected cases were reported, 162 specimens collected and 56 patients tested positive of the virus. Strategies to reduce the burden of the disease include quality immunisation, supplementary routine, effective surveillance and case management."

The state's Health Educator, Mr Ribado Jibrin, said the 2017 measles campaign would be done in phases to ensure that the 1.7 million eligible children were effectively captured. He said "Bauchi State will conduct measles campaign in 2 phases to capture eligible children from 9 to 59 months. The 1st phase will hold between 30 Nov 2017 and 5 Dec 2017 in Alkaleri, Bauchi, Bogoro, Darazo, Dass and Giade, Jamaáre, Kirfi, Tafawa Balewa, Toro and Warji. The 2nd phase, to hold on a date to be given later, will take place in Dambam, Gamawa, Ganjuwa, Itas Gadau, Katagum,Misau and Ningi local governments. "

Earlier, the state's Immunisation Officer, Mr Bakoji Ahmed, said that the campaign was split into phases to ensure that the expected target was achieved. He said "our target is to have 97 per cent coverage in the state and 98 per cent at the local governments and 100 per cent coverage at ward level."

["Though there has been a substantial decline in global measles death, Nigeria still tops the chart of number of children not vaccinated against measles.

"A new report published by the World Health Organisation indicates that 20.8 million children worldwide are still missing their 1st measles vaccine dose and more than half of these unvaccinated children live in 6 countries. Nigeria tops the list of countries with unvaccinated children from measles with 3.3 million children, followed by India - 2.9 million, Pakistan - 2.0 million, Indonesia - 1.2 million, Ethiopia - 0.9 million and Democratic Republic of Congo, DRC, with 0.7 million.

"A UNICEF survey earlier revealed that measles among children under the age of 5 increased more than 2-fold in Northern Nigeria between 2014 and 2016.

"To curtail the spread of the disease and prevent death of children under 5, the federal government has released N3.5 billion [approx. 9 730 000 USD] for vaccination programme and a nationwide measles campaign has been rolled out for the 2017/2018 measles immunisation calendar.

"The measles campaign was billed to have started on 26 Oct 2017 in 19 northern states.

"According to the statement, since 2000, an estimate of 5.5 billion doses of measles containing vaccines have been provided for children through routine immunisation services and mass vaccination campaigns, saving an estimated 20.4 million lives.

"According to the leading health organisations, there was a decline in global death from the disease in 2016 as an estimated 90 000 people died from measles. This is 84 per cent drop from more than 550 000 deaths in 2000."
