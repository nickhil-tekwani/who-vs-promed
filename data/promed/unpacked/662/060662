A total of 91 confirmed cases of leptospirosis were recorded in Fiji in the last week. The Ministry of Health and Medical Services also noted that 134 cases were reported since the last update a week ago, and 43 more cases recorded for previous weeks.

Ministry permanent secretary [PS] Dr James Fong said while a decreasing trend was noted in the last update, they were now seeing an upward trend in cases in the last week, driven by increasing lab-positive cases from the Western Division.

In the Western Division, Dr Fong said there had been 617 cases, with 62 new cases in the last week, and 8 more reported for previous weeks. He said while the case trend was downward in the last update, numbers had increased again beyond the outbreak threshold in the Western Division in the last week.

In the Central Division, there have been 556 cases, with 17 new cases in the last week and 30 more cases for previous weeks. Dr Fong said case numbers had continued to decline below the outbreak threshold in the Central Division in the last week.

In the Northern Division, there have been 307 cases, with 9 new cases in the last week. He said case numbers had continued to decline below the outbreak threshold in the Northern Division in the last week and were now at levels below the expected for this time of the year.

"In the Eastern Division, there have been 48 cases, with 3 new cases in the last week, and 5 more cases in previous weeks. Case numbers have continued to decline below the outbreak threshold in the last week," the PS said.

For national leptospirosis hospital admissions so far this year [2022], there have been 475 people admitted in total. There have been
- 262 admissions in the West with 28 new admissions last week;
- 149 admissions in Central with 12 admissions last week;
- 48 admissions in the Northern Division with 4 new admissions in the last week; and
- 16 admissions in the Eastern Division with one in the last week.

Dr Fong also reported 2 more deaths caused by leptospirosis: a 35-year-old female and a 23-year-old male from Nadi. He said there had been a total of 31 deaths from leptospirosis this year [2022], with 23 in the Western Division, 3 in the Central Division, and 5 in the North.

There have been 1528 lab-confirmed cases of leptospirosis this year [2022].

[For a discussion of leptospirosis, please see my moderator comments in a prior ProMED post: Leptospirosis - Fiji: fatal, flood-related 20220215.8701482.

The news report above says that the total lab-confirmed cases of leptospirosis this year (2022) have risen from 1394 cases on 24 Mar 2022 to 1528 and deaths from 29 to 31 in this time period (see post 20220326.8702241). The worst-hit region has been the Western Division.

The sources for the current outbreak in Fiji have been attributed to illegal piggeries and the improper disposal of wastewater in informal settlements, in addition to flooding (ProMED post Leptospirosis - Fiji (02): illegal piggeries/improper wastewater disposal, flooding 20220319.8702072).

Fiji is an island nation in Melanesia in the South Pacific Ocean about 2000 km (1300 mi) northeast of New Zealand's North Island (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiji). Fiji is divided into 4 major divisions: Central, Eastern, Northern, and Western. For a map of Fiji's divisions, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fiji_divisions_named.png.

Outbreaks frequently follow heavy rainfalls and flooding with fresh water. Fiji's wet season is from November to April, with the heaviest rains falling between December and mid-April (http://www.lonelyplanet.com/fiji/weather). Fiji suffered flooding due to Tropical Cyclone Cody in January 2022, especially in the western side of Viti Levu (Western Division) (https://floodlist.com/australia/fiji-tropical-storm-cody-floods-january-2022). Viti Levu is the country's main island and home to 70% of the country's population (about 600 000 people). - Mod.ML
