Echovirus Type 13 in the United States, 2001
--------------------------------------------
Echoviruses constitute one of the major groups of the genus _Enterovirus_
and are associated with illnesses including aseptic meningitis, nonspecific
rashes, encephalitis, and myositis (1). Echovirus 13 is an enterovirus that
rarely has been detected in the United States, accounting for only 65 of
approximately 45 000 enterovirus isolates reported to CDC during the period
1970 to 2000. No associated outbreaks have been reported in this country.
As of June 2001, 8 state public health laboratories and one private
laboratory had reported an increased number of echovirus 13 isolates to
CDC, most associated with aseptic meningitis. This report summarizes
echovirus 13 activity in the United States and highlights the investigation
of aseptic meningitis outbreaks in Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, and
Tennessee. Echovirus 13 should be considered in the differential diagnosis
of persons with aseptic meningitis.
CDC's National Enterovirus Surveillance System (NESS) relies on voluntary
reporting of enterovirus isolates by serotype from state public health
laboratories (2). Aseptic meningitis was removed as a nationally notifiable
disease in 1995, and no uniform nationally recognized case definition
exists for this condition (3). Cases of aseptic meningitis described in
this report represent physician diagnoses based on clinical presentation
and laboratory findings.
As of 14 Aug 2001, echovirus 13 has been isolated in specimens from 76
patients in 13 states (Tennessee [26, Mississippi [10, Louisiana [9,
Florida [8, Texas [6, California [6, Kentucky [3, Ohio [2, Montana
[2, and Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, and North Carolina [one each). Of 76
isolates tested, 51 (67%) were from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 12 (16%)
from stool or rectal swabs. The source specimens for these isolates were
collected during March to June 2001.
Of the 76 patients, 47 (62%) were male. The patients ranged in age from 2
weeks to 29 years (median age: 7 months). Most (73 [96%) were aged <15
years, 41 (54%) were infants aged <1 year, and 29 (38%) were aged <3
months. Clinical diagnoses were reported for 52 (68%) of the 76 patients
and included aseptic meningitis (50 patients), febrile illness (1), and
diarrhea (1). Of 50 isolates from patients with a diagnosis of aseptic
meningitis, 45 were associated with outbreaks of aseptic meningitis in 4
states (26 from Tennessee, 9 from Mississippi, 8 from Louisiana, and 2 from
Montana) during April to July 2001.
Louisiana: In June, 27 cases of aseptic meningitis among patients admitted
to one hospital during 22 May to 20 Jun were reported to the Louisiana
Office of Public Health, representing a 9-fold increase in the number of
aseptic meningitis hospitalizations over the same period during 2000. All
of the patients resided in 3 parishes (i.e., counties) in the southeastern
part of the state. Of the 27 cases, 20 (74%) occurred in the same parish
(hospitalization rate: 20 per 100 000 population). Reported clinical
symptoms included fever (94%), headache (77%), vomiting (77%), stiff neck
(50%), and photophobia (23%).
Mississippi: During 5 May to 31 Jul, 56 cases of aseptic meningitis were
reported to the Mississippi State Department of Health from one regional
medical center. Of the 56 patients, 41 (73%) resided in a county adjacent
to the Louisiana parish that accounted for most of the cases in Louisiana.
The hospitalization rate for this Mississippi county was 111 per 100 000
population. Reported clinical symptoms included fever (75%), headache
(70%), vomiting (55%), nausea (52%), and stiff neck (20%).
Montana: During 8 Jun to 11 Jul, 23 cases of aseptic meningitis were
reported to the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services
(MDPHHS) from a single county in the southeastern part of the state
(hospitalization rate: 181 per 100 000 population). Some 18 additional
cases of aseptic meningitis reported from a neighboring county since early
July are being investigated by MDPHHS.
Tennessee: An outbreak of aseptic meningitis involving approximately 250
persons admitted to a hospital in Tennessee since April 2001 is being
investigated by the Tennessee State Health Department. Echovirus 13 has
been confirmed as the etiologic agent for 33 of 75 cases.

MMWR Editorial Note:
This is the first report of widespread circulation of echovirus 13 and of
outbreaks associated with this enterovirus in the United States. Increased
echovirus 13 activity also was reported in Europe during 2000, when
echovirus 13 was associated for the first time with outbreaks of aseptic
meningitis in England, Wales, and Germany (4,5).
Clinical manifestations of enterovirus infections are protean, ranging from
asymptomatic carriage to life-threatening illness (6). Because echovirus 13
rarely has been isolated, the spectrum of disease associated with this
virus has not been well established. Conditions previously associated with
echovirus 13 are typical of enterovirus infections (6) and include
asymptomatic carriage (6), mild febrile illness (7), aseptic meningitis
(4,5,8,9), respiratory diseases (e.g., coryza, pharyngitis, bronchitis, and
bronchiolitis [7,9), poliomyelitis-like illness (8), diarrhea with fever
(7,9), rash (7,9), encephalitis (9), and enteroviral sepsis (9). Aseptic
meningitis is the predominant illness associated with the current echovirus
13 activity in the United States and with echovirus activity reported in
Europe in 2000. However, patients with meningitis are more likely be tested
for enteroviruses than are patients with milder illnesses.
In temperate climates, enteroviruses demonstrate a marked seasonality, with
widespread circulation during summer and fall. A typical enterovirus season
in the United States lasts from June through October (9). In 2001, the
first isolations of echovirus 13 in the United States were reported in
March. The reported outbreaks of aseptic meningitis associated with this
serotype started early in the enterovirus season.
The age distribution of patients with echovirus 13 isolates and of the
other cases involved in the 3 aseptic meningitis outbreaks indicates that
young children are at highest risk for infection. A similar age
distribution was observed during the aseptic meningitis outbreak associated
with echovirus 13 in Germany in 2000 (5), but the outbreaks in England and
Wales predominantly affected older children (4).
In addition to echovirus 13, other enterovirus serotypes have been
identified in these outbreaks of aseptic meningitis. The isolation of
several enteroviruses in community outbreaks is not unusual because
numerous serotypes commonly co-circulate. Predominant enterovirus serotypes
tend to change over time (10). In the United States, the serotypes most
commonly reported to NESS were echoviruses 30, 6, and 7 in 1997,
echoviruses 30, 9, and 11 in 1998, and echoviruses 11, 16, and 9 in 1999
(2). Although the clinical ranges of diseases associated with various
enterovirus serotypes overlap, some manifestations of enterovirus infection
are associated commonly with certain serotypes (i.e., aseptic meningitis
and echovirus 30, hand-foot-and-mouth disease and coxsackievirus A16, and
acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis and enterovirus 70 and coxsackievirus A24)
(6).
Enterovirus surveillance is important for understanding circulation
patterns of these viruses in the United States. In addition, this
information may be helpful for evaluating potential anti-enterovirus drugs
and in understanding the links of enteroviruses with disease. More
information is needed to clarify the epidemiologic characteristics and to
define better the clinical spectrum of associated diseases. No specific
prevention or control measures are available for nonpolio enteroviruses,
including echovirus 13. Adherence to good hygienic practices, such as
frequent and thorough hand washing (especially after diaper changes),
disinfection of contaminated surfaces by household cleaners (e.g., diluted
bleach solution), and avoidance of sharing utensils and drinking containers
may be effective in reducing the spread of infection.
