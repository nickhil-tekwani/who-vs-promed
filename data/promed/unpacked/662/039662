[The site is very close to the Polish border with Ukraine, whether viewed on the OIE map or on Fallingrain.com: http://www.fallingrain.com/world/PL/70/Tomaszow_Lubelski.html.

This is a puzzler. Livestock anthrax is presently absent in Poland, with the last recorded outbreak in cattle in 2001 and just a scattering of 8 outbreaks back to 1991. But it is more common in humans, e.g., 4 in 2009, 2 in 2005, 1 in 2002, 1 in 1999, 2 in 1998, and so on. Since the site is so close to the Ukrainian border, one might suspect a Ukrainian exposure for this horse. With the present problems in Ukraine, disease reporting is not high on their list of priorities. Their most recent reported outbreaks were in cattle in 2012 in Cherkassy (Central Ukraine) and Zaporozhye (Eastern Ukraine), far from Poland. So until the results of their investigation are reported, it would be logical to expect the horse to have been exposed to whatever initiates their human cases. - Mod.MHJ
