Over the past several years we have observed a substantial number of soybean plants exhibiting foliar symptoms that appear similar to sudden death syndrome (SDS) or other root-based issues. The foliage of the affected plants develops [symptoms that] range from minimal chlorosis to trifoliate leaves becoming completely yellow. These symptoms often appear in vegetative growth stages, while SDS will generally not be observed until late reproductive stages. Plants often miss a taproot, have a blackened mass growing around the root, blackened lateral roots, and plant tissue feels brittle. Plants at advanced reproductive stages have a general staining of vascular tissues.

Either single plants or small clumps of plants exhibit symptoms, generally along the same row within a field. The disease occurs in almost every soil class in MS, regardless of soybean variety or irrigation practice, and from south to north MS, typically in small scattered areas. During 2014, likely due to cooler and wetter than normal conditions, we observed increased levels of the disease. Since 2007 the disease has also been referred to as "black root rot". However, the fungus that causes black root rot, _Thielaviopsis basicola_ [see ProMED-mail post 20100429.1384], has not been recovered from infected plant or root systems in MS.

For the 2015 season there are likely no management practices to reduce the potential yield loss that can be associated with the disease. Research is currently underway at MSU [Mississippi State University], as well as at the University of Arkansas and LSU [Louisiana State University], to determine the specific causal organism. Greenhouse trials as well as additional plant tissue sampling will be conducted throughout the 2015 season.

[This report illustrates the importance of identifying the cause and/or pathogen(s) associated with a disease to be able to design management strategies. The statement above that symptoms usually appear in individual plants or clusters along the same row in a field may point towards possible mechanical transmission of an infectious agent by farming activities.

Sudden death syndrome (SDS) is widespread the US, Argentina and Brazil. Yield losses may be more than 80 percent, depending on variety and timing of infection. The fungus _Fusarium virguliforme_ has been described as the causal pathogen of SDS in North America and _F. tucumaniae_ in South America. Soybean cyst nematode (SCN; _Heterodera glycines_), although not required for severe SDS to occur, is reported to exacerbate foliar symptoms and lead to early and severe SDS. Other pathogens are still being studied for a potential role in SDS.
