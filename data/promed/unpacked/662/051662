According to Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for Monitoring Consumer
Rights Protection and Human Welfare] the river Amur and other water
sources do not satisfy norms of microbiological safety. According to
Vladimir Ott, the Healthcare Officer for [Khabarovsk Krai], an
increased incidence of viral meningitis morbidity has been observed
in settlements along the Amur coast. As of 11 Jul 2007, 59 patients
have been admitted to Khabarovsk hospitals on suspicion of viral
meningitis. The diagnosis has been confirmed in 18 cases.
All cases of infection originated in the city of Komsomolsk-na-Amure
and the surrounding area. Hepatitis A virus and rotaviruses have been
detected in samples of river water. According to a special public
health commission appointed by of the Government of the Khabarovsk
Krai, between 1 Jun and 10 Jul 2007, the number of cases of viral
meningitis recorded in Komsomolsk-na-Amure was more than 4 times
greater than the long term average. About 70 percent of the patients
were children between 3- and 6-years-old. The diagnosis of
enterovirus infection was based on laboratory analysis of clinical
samples. Laboratory analysis for 35 percent of patient samples was
enterovirus-positive.
The Water Supply Authority for the Khabarovsk Krai and the city of
Komsomolsk-na-Amure has reorganized the microbiological quality
monitoring of potable water derived from the river Amur. During the
1st 6 months of 2007, hepatitis A virus and rotavirus antigens had
been detected in every 10th sample from the river Amur.
