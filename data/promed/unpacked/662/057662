The death of a woman this week brought to 5 the number of people who have
died from leptospirosis in the northern Dominican Republic city of Santiago
in 1999, health
authorities reported Friday.
The fifth victim was a 35-year-old woman, who was diagnosed with the
disease after running a temperature, with aches and tremors.
Leptospirosis is caused by bacteria found in the urine of rats and domestic
animals feeding on trash and drinking contaminated water.
According to relatives of the deceased woman in the Hoya de Caimito
neighborhood of Santiago, the area teems with rats feeding on trash.
Dominican health authorities said that hundreds of people had checked into
a local hospital with symptoms of leptospirosis and that the incidence of
the disease in the city of Santiago had reached alarming proportions.
Authorities added that the main cause of death from leptospirosis is lung
hemorrhage, brought about by respiratory failure and a breakdown of the
body's coagulation system.

laboratory confirmed. A woman died at the beginning of the year [1999.
Serovars are _icterohaemorraghiae_, _canicola_ and _hardjo_.
