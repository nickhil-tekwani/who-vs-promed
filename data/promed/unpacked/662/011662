<http://www.phuketgazette.net/archives/articles/2010/article9070.html>


There have been 383 cases of dengue fever year-to-date in Phuket, but
no deaths, the Ministry of Public Health says. Dr Wiwat Seetamanotch,
deputy director of the Phuket Public Health Office and an expert on
the disease, said the total of 383 cases so far this year [2010] has
already surpassed the total number of cases in 2009, when 309 were
recorded all year [2009]. The incidence rate ranks Phuket at number
20 out of Thailand's 77 provinces, he said.

That the disease is spreading more quickly under wet, monsoon-season
conditions is evidenced by the fact that there were just 213 cases of
dengue reported in Phuket from [1 Jan 2010 to 12 June 2010].

"We must accept that despite our efforts to eradicate them, the
mosquitoes that vector this disease are getting more difficult to
control, in part due to increasing resistance to pesticide sprays,"
Dr Wiwat said.

He specified a 4-point strategy that is effective at limiting
breeding opportunities for the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito that spreads
misery in the form of chikungunya and yellow fever, as well dengue.
- Place lids on all water containers to prevent mosquito from laying
eggs in them;
- Change the water in all containers every 7 days;
- Release guppies or other small fish into ponds to feed on mosquito larvae;
- Limit potential breeding sites in and around residences.

The spread of dengue is far worse in the Deep South, where some 6500
people in 5 provinces contracted the disease from [1 Jan 2010 to 29
Jul 2010], with 13 deaths. In Songkhla Province alone, 2592 people
were reported ill with the fever and 6 died over the same period.

The latest victim was a 11-month-old baby who died on [27 Jul 2010]
in Haad Yai. Children under 2 years of age are especially at risk of
dying from the disease.

fatality rate was 0.11 percent.

Regarding the 383 cases of dengue infection in Phuket province
between 1 Jan 2010 to 31 Jul 2010, there were 115 cases of dengue
fever (DF), 264 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and 4 cases
of dengue shock syndrome (DSS). No deaths were reported.

Comparing over the same time period between 2009 and 2010, the number
of cases due to dengue infection in Thailand was higher in 2010 than
2009 by 83 percent, and the most prevalent of cases were reported in
the South, followed by the Central and the Northeast (see prior
PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - Thailand (07) 20100811.2758).

<http://thainews.prd.go.th/en/news.php?id=255308100006>


The Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) has voiced concern over the
spread of dengue fever in all provinces nationwide after the number
of infections was found higher than last year [2009] by 83 percent.

Public Health minister Jurin Laksanawisit considered the ongoing
spread of dengue fever a worrying issue. He said the Ministry had
been monitoring the epidemic spread closely from June [2010] to
August [2010] and last week [week of 2 Aug 2010] accumulated the
number of patients at 41 413, higher than the previous week by 3000,
along with 10 confirmed fatalities. The disease this year [2010] has
been found most prevalent in the South, followed by the Central and
the Northeast.

The minister hence has assigned related units to exterminate spawning
sites and larvae of mosquitoes and suggested that people protect
themselves from mosquito bites.

Many children with dengue fever have suffered serious complications
as the disease is spreading through out the country, said the
Pediatrics Hospital No.1 on [8 Aug 2010].

The hospital's emergency room has received many children with serious
complications recently, as the number of dengue fever patients is
rising. Around 10 percent of the children suffering from dengue fever
have experienced complications, according to the hospital's deputy
director Le Thi Bich Lien. Dr. Lien warned parents to take their
children to hospital immediately if they suddenly develop a high
fever, rash, muscle and joint pain, nausea, or vomiting.

Most dengue infections result in relatively mild illnesses, but some
can progress to dengue hemorrhagic fever. With dengue hemorrhagic
fever, the blood vessels start to leak and cause bleeding from the
nose, mouth, gums, or vagina in girls.

The tropical dengue fever virus has spread to Broward mosquitoes,
health officials said Thursday [12 Aug 2010], after tests confirmed
the 1st known case of the disease being contracted in the county. An
adult who had not left Broward for weeks came down with the
mosquito-borne disease this month [August 2010], meaning Broward is
now the 2nd place in the continental United States -- after Key West
-- where [locally acquired] dengue fever exists.

Broward County Health Department officials would not identify the
person or disclose where the person lives, but said the county would
step up mosquito spraying and hammer harder on its message to prevent
bug [mosquito] bites -- especially since Florida has logged a few
cases of other mosquito diseases such as West Nile virus. "The person
has recovered fully," said Dr Paul Thaqi, health department director.
"This is an important opportunity for us to emphasize to folks to
prevent mosquito-borne disease."

In Key West, at least 53 [dengue] cases have been reported since the
outbreak began in September [2009], including a Wilton Manors woman
infected while visiting the island.

Carina Blackmore, a mosquito-disease specialist with the Florida
Department of Health, said she was certain the local mosquito got the
virus by biting someone in Broward who had contracted dengue fever
[virus] while traveling in the Caribbean, South America, or a country
where the disease is prevalent. Blackmore said she was certain
because the person in Broward caught the type-3 strain of dengue
[virus]. The strain circulating in Key West is called type-1 [virus],
so the new case could not be related to Key West. "I'm not surprised
this has shown up there," Blackmore said. "South Florida has a lot of
travelers to Central America and the Caribbean. Plenty of people
bring back dengue fever [virus] to Florida every year. It just
doesn't happen very often, so it goes undetected. Because of our
increased surveillance now from the Key West cases, we're now picking
it up." So far this year, 57 Floridians have contracted dengue while
traveling outside the country, state figures show.

The culprit [vector] is typically the _Aedes aegypti_. The bug
[mosquito] lives in close proximity to humans, often in yards or in
the house. It breeds in clean, standing water, including puddles as
tiny as bottle caps that collect in recycling bins, pet dishes, and
plant pots. Thaqi, the health director, stressed the oft-recited
steps to prevent mosquito bites: eliminate standing water; stay
indoors at dusk and dawn; wear long sleeves and pants when outdoors;
wear repellent with DEET; and repair window screens.

Jamaica has recorded 27 more confirmed cases of dengue fever over the
past week, pushing the total number to 104. Dr Eva Lewis-Fuller,
director of health promotion and protection in the Ministry of
Health, said the ministry was also investigating an additional 7
cases of DHF -- the more severe form of the disease. This would bring
the total number of the severe cases to 14. In recent weeks, cases of
dengue fever and DHF have been rising in Jamaica and the rest of the Caribbean.

Minister of Health Rudyard Spencer had announced during a press
conference at Jamaica House last Tuesday [10 Aug 2010] that 77
laboratory confirmed cases had been detected, including 7 confirmed
cases of the severe type. But despite the rapid increase in the
number of cases, Lewis-Fuller said the number of persons confirmed
with the virus was far less than the actual number of persons who
have been infected. She said the ministry suspected that the larger
number of infected persons were not reported to the ministry.

"We are seeing an increase in the number of confirmed and suspected
cases of dengue fever and could have an explosive outbreak if we do
not contain it, and we need the help of the population to do so," she
told The Gleaner yesterday.

The vice minister for the Collective Health Networks, Miriam Morales,
stated yesterday [10 Aug 2010] that up to epidemiological week 30
(25-31 Jul 2010), the Ministry of Health registered a cumulative
total of 68 753 [dengue] cases, of which 6418 are DHF. During that
week there were 3348 new [dengue] illnesses. These figures exceed the
cumulative total for 2009, which closed with [a total of] 65 869
affected individuals, of which 5149 suffered DHF. While the
difference with respect to last year [2009] is 2884 cases more; what
is worrying is the occurrence of DHF, which, in comparison to 2009,
has increased in incidence by 24.6 percent.

Oswaldo Godoy, former Ministry of Health epidemiologist, stated that
the [number of] dengue cases, given the current panorama, will exceed
80 000 by the end of 2010. He stated that the epidemic began in May
2009, so it now has been going on for 14 months. Despite spending
millions for prevention and education, there continue to be reported
more than 2000 [dengue] patients per week.

Following the confirmation of 485 cases of classic dengue and 24
cases of DHF in Bolivar department [state or province equivalent],
authorities launched an alert for citizens to control the epidemic of
the disease [dengue] that has greatly increased in 2010.

Although the number of cases of dengue fever in Bolivar could
increase if the at least 200 suspect cases that are being analysed
are confirmed, departmental health officials remain prudent but
campaigns have increased in the municipalities where the disease has
increased rapidly.

According to Martha Lucia Hernandez Gutierrez, the project leader of
vector-borne diseases for the departmental Secretariat of Health,
dengue is a cyclical disease and it is affected by the weather. For
that reason, she said, in addition to the regular ravages of winter,
floods and landslides, increased rainfall brings other dangers,
including the proliferation of the mosquito that transmits dengue,
which is a major health risk.
