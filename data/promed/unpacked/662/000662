The Health Ministry's laboratory has confirmed a Tangerang domestic
helper died from the bird flu virus Friday [17 Aug 2007], bringing
the country's death toll to 83. The victim died at Tangerang's Sari
Asih Hospital on Tuesday [14 Aug 2007] after 2 days of treatment for
a high fever and acute pneumonia, a release made available for The
Jakarta Post confirmed Saturday [18 Aug 2007].
The maid's employers, who are residents of Perumnas II in Tangerang
regency, said they had no idea how their maid contracted the virus
because there were no fowl at their home or in the neighborhood.
The employer said his maid was treated at a clinic for a high fever
and cough earlier this month [August 2007]. He said, "Her condition
improved after she took the medicine and she was able to baby-sit my child."
The employer said his family and the housemaid did not have direct
contact with live poultry and birds near the house. "The only contact
(with chickens) we had was on 27 Jul 2007, when my maid went with me
to the market, just 200 metres (0.12 mi) from my home, to buy chicken
meat," he said. He said he had never purchased live chicken from the market.
The maid's body has been claimed by her family to be buried in
Cilacap, Central Java. Yuliah Iskandar, the regency health agency's
head of communicable disease prevention, said a team had been
assigned to investigate the source of the H5N1 virus in the
neighborhood. "There are no indications that bird flu has spread in
the neighborhood, but we have taken blood samples from residents to
be tested in a laboratory," she told the Jakarta Post on Saturday [18
Aug 2007].
Following the deaths of an official at the Supreme Audit Agency
(BPK), and his 2 young daughters early in July 2005, the central
government declared Tangerang a bird flu red zone. Since then, the
agency has recorded less than 10 deaths in the regency, Yuliah said.
Meanwhile, Banten has recorded 14 human cases of bird flu, 12 of
which were fatal.
On 19 Jan 2007, Banten Governor Ratu Atut Chosiah issued a bylaw on
poultry restrictions, which included a ban on keeping backyard fowl.
The ordinance however, has not yet taken effect due to prolonged
protests from the Banten Council.
A similar ordinance was issued by the Jakarta administration
following new outbreaks in the capital in January [2007].
Initially a disease that affected poultry and birds, the H5N1 virus
is now able to infect humans, but so far there is no evidence to
suggest the disease can be transferred from human to human.
