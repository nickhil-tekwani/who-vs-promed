Report on anthrax outbreaks of 2011 developed in 2 regions of South
Italy
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
>From 28 Aug to 27 Sep 2011 in an area of about 50 sq km [20 sq mi]
involving the regions of Basilicata and Campania, there have been 28
outbreaks of anthrax. Multiple tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) with 15
VNTRs [variable number of tandem repeats] on 28 isolates revealed the
simultaneous circulation of 3 genotypes. While in Campania region the
GT/Sal [8 samples] has been the responsible for all outbreaks of
anthrax, in Basilicata 2 genotypes of _Bacillus anthracis_ have been
identified: Gt/Pz1 [16 samples] and Gt/Pz2 [4 samples]. Climatic
factors have favored the appearance of the disease but the role of
tabanids in the circulation of the pathogen is strongly suspected. The
vaccine remains the most effective in controlling the disease.

More than 60 animals were affected, but only 30 were sampled, and
anthrax confirmed in 28; the other 2 had clostridial infections.
Interestingly, but not unexpectedly, the primary 2011 strain in
Basilicata, GT/Pz1, is the same as the epidemic strain seen in that
province in 2004. The difference between Pz1 and Pz2 was in the pX01
gene value of 121 (Pz1) vs 119 (Pz2), a not hyper-stable area.

An interesting aspect of this series of outbreaks was the high
frequency of oedematous lesions on the affected animals. This was
ascribed to the significant part played by tabanid (biting) flies in
spreading infection from animal to animal.

For the report on the 2004 epidemic, see

Adone, M Hugh-Jones: Anthrax outbreaks in Italy in 2004: genetic
analysis of isolates and evaluation of risk factors associated with
outbreaks. New Microbiologica 33(1): 83-6.

Basilicata and Campania are the 2 southern provinces most commonly
afflicted. Interestingly the predominate strain here is A1.a, which
stretches from Kazakhstan to Albania, France, and southern Italy, and
to the west side of the Mississippi in North America. - Mod.MHJ]
