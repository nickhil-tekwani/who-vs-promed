Re: Avian influenza (50): Turkey (Edirne), Laos 20080320.1066
-------------------------------------------------------------
Turkish authorities have reported that the source of the recent
outbreak of avian influenza in Ipsala/Edirne (Western Turkey) was
"Fomites (humans, vehicles, feed, etc.)" (OIE-World Organization for
Animal Health report 6907, report date: 18 Mar 2008). Ukraine has
come to the same conclusion regarding the recent outbreaks in Crimea
[see comment]. (OIE report 6909, report date: 19 Mar 2008).

Obviously it would be important for other countries to know exactly
the origin of the virus to take preventive measures, if necessary.
There is the possibility that the Turkish outbreak is related to
recent arrests of illegal migrants in Ipsala, who may have come from
outbreak regions (such as, Egypt, Bangladesh); however, no
confirmation is available [the said arrests are reported in a
newswire of 17 Mar 2008; see at
<http://www.turkishpress.com/news.asp?id=220858&s=&i=&t=Illegal_Migrant_Operations.
- Mod.AS]

Is there any information available on how the authorities determined
the source of the outbreak?

[Though Turkey's recent report, dated 18 Mar 2008, mentions fomites
as the possible source of infection, it should be said that the 6
H5N1 outbreaks, which occurred earlier this year (2008) in Turkey --
along its northern shores along the Black Sea -- were considered to
have their source in wild birds. The summary of this chain of
outbreaks including a map can be seen at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=6700>.

The reports, and the sources of infection as ascribed to the
respective outbreaks, were the following:

1. Immediate notification (22 Jan 2008): 1 outbreak, contact with wild species
2. Follow-up report No. 1 (28 Jan 2008): no new outbreak Contact with
wild species
3. Follow-up report No. 2 (04 Feb 2008): 1 new outbreak, contact with
wild species
4. Follow-up report No. 3 (12 Feb 2008): 1 new outbreak, contact with
wild species
5. Follow-up report No. 4 (13 Feb 2008): 2 new outbreaks, contact
with wild species
6. Follow-up report No. 5 (26 Feb 2008): 1 new outbreak, contact with
wild species
7. Follow-up report No. 6 (05 Mar 2008): no new outbreaks, contact
with wild species
8. Follow-up report No. 7 - Final report (12 Mar 2008): no new
outbreaks, outbreak resolved; contact with wild species

Could a possible source of the fomites, incriminated as infecting the
Edirne farm, be sought in one or more of the earlier outbreaks?!

As to the Ukrainian (Crimean) epizootic, with 3 outbreaks, see their
summary including a map at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=6698>.

The outbreaks and their respective sources of infection were the following:

1. Immediate notification (21 Jan 2008): unknown or inconclusive [1 outbreak]
2. Follow-up report No. 1 (30 Jan 2008): contact with wild birds [No
new outbreak]
3. Follow-up report No. 2 (13 Feb 2008): contact with wild birds [2
new outbreaks]
4. Follow-up report No. 3 (25 Feb 2008): fomites [no new outbreaks].
The 3rd follow-up report included also the following epidemiological
commentary: "Phylogenetic sequencing of the isolate conforms to
sequence of viruses of avian influenza obtained in 2007 in Czech
Republic, Romania, Great Britain, and Poland. Virus isolate nucleonic
sequence conforms to the same one derived in Czech Republic (A \ mute
\ swan \ Czech Republic \ 10732 \ 07) with a confidence level of 99.5 percent".
5. Follow-up report No. 4 (19 Mar 2008): fomites [no new outbreaks].

The scenario, which emerges from the Ukrainian OIE reports may be
interpreted as being rather similar to the Turkish one, namely
initial outbreak(s) related to contact with wild birds, followed by
further spread by fomites. - Mod.AS]

Illegal chickens in northern area test positive for bird flu
------------------------------------------------------------
Out of 104 samples of illegally imported chickens confiscated since
February [2008], 24 have tested positive for the H5N1 virus, Lang Son
Animal Health Department reported yesterday [21 Mar 2008].

Most of the chickens were seized mainly in northern Lang Son
Province's Trang Dinh and Loc Binh districts and in Lang Son City.

Provincial veterinarians took samples of the trafficked chickens for
testing before killing them.

The province has seized and destroyed over 60 tonnes of
non-quarantined chickens since the beginning of the year [2008]. But
authorities said it was too little compared to the illegally imported
chickens that had been successfully transported and consumed through
the province.

Although no bird flu outbreaks have been reported in the province,
the local Animal Health Department immediately vaccinated poultry in
its bordering communes, Lang Son City and in districts where National
Highway 1A passes through.

Southern Ca Mau Province yesterday [21 Mar 2008] also declared bird
flu outbreaks after the H5N1 virus killed 30 muscovy ducks on a farm
in Hiep Tung Commune, Nam Can District, listing it as the 8th
province on Viet Nam's current bird flu-hit list.

One day earlier [20 Mar 2008], central Quang Nam Province had
reported fresh outbreaks on duck farms in Tam Ky and Nui Thanh
districts, said the Viet Nam Animal Health Department.

Other bird flu-stricken areas include Tuyen Quang, Lao Cai, and Ha
Noi in the north, Quang Binh, and Quang Tri in the centre and Soc
Trang in the south.

Lang Son's proximity to the Chinese border may be indicative of the
source of infection; is H5N1 reporting (or surveillance) in China
deficient? See also map at
