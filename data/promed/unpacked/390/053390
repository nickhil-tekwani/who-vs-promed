A 41-year-old woman is the 1st fatal case of dengue hemorrhagic fever
(DHF) this year [2007], confirmed by a Ministry of Health physician
on Sunday [21 Jan 2007].
Ivan Allende, Director of the Department of Transmissible Diseases,
informed the press that before she died, the woman indicated that
several weeks before she had been in cities in the department [state
or province equivalent. - Mod.TY] of Caagauzu, where the mosquito
_Aedes aegypti_ is abundant.
The Minister of Health, Oscar Martinez, indicated that in January of
this year [2007], 400 cases of dengue have been recorded, "but the
estimates are that if the population does not collaborate with [the
implementation] of preventive measures, the number of cases could
reach 400 000."
Allende indicated that in 2006, there were 1600 cases.

At least 4 persons had died while 12 others, mostly minors, were
hospitalized in Bayugan town, Agusan del Sur [Province] in what
health authorities fear to be a dengue outbreak.
Sun-Star Cagayan de Oro reported Mon 19 Jan 2007 that at least 13
other persons are undergoing treatment.
Bayugan is a 1st class town in Agusan del Sur province with a
population of 93 623 people in 17 222 households.
Town mayor Magdalena Asis and municipal nurse Helen Saligan said most
of the victims are aged 1-4. They will submit on Mon 19 Jan 2007 an
official list and breakdown in age grouping.
Health authorities said they already conducted fumigation of areas
affected and conducted information and dissemination campaigns. Yet
Asis said 3 weeks of continuous rains have afflicted schoolchildren
at a local school in Barangay Poblacion with dengue fever. At least 2
had died from dengue, with 13 cases last month [December 2006], while
2 others, mostly one-year-olds, were killed this January 2007.
Saligan voiced fears the number may rise if no immediate remedies are
installed. Government officials have already asked for support from
the provincial government to contain the diseases affecting mostly
poor people in the area.
A "bandillo system" is in place among houses and puroks [puroks are a
political-geographic subdivision such as a city block] to inform
residents about the possible spread of the diseases in affected areas
by barangay [larger political-geographic subdivision that may contain
several puroks] and municipal officials.

Dengue outbreak kills 28 in Indonesia
-------------------------------------------
At least 28 people have died and hundreds were infected in an
outbreak of dengue fever on Java since New Year's Day, a local report
said Thu 25 Jan 2007.
The mosquito-borne disease is at its worse during the current monsoon
season, which creates pools of water that are ideal breeding places,
The Jakarta Post reported.
The worst-hit region has been West Java province, where 23 people
died and 848 were infected since 1 Jan [2007], leaving hospital
staffs scrambling to find enough personnel and space to treat
patients.; 4 other people, including 2 children, have died in the
Central Java city of Yogyakarta, and one more in eastern Indonesia,
the paper reported.
"We still cannot predict when the peak of the outbreak will be due to
changeable climate conditions," Maya Sintodewi, a public health
official in Yogyakarta's Bantul regency, was quoted as saying.
The situation in Central Java is potentially more dire this year
[2007] because tens of thousands of people remain in makeshift
emergency shelters following the May 2006 earthquake there and are
more exposed to mosquito bites.

This month [January 2007], the number of dengue cases escalated by
the dozen each day, reaching 1240 with 6 fatalities as of Tue 23 Jan
2007, 3 of whom died in Tarakan.
A resident of Rawa Lele subdistrict in West Jakarta, who was admitted
to the hospital with dengue 3 days ago, was surprised to find 4 of
her neighbors in the same ward. "We live in neighboring units," she
said. They had chosen the hospital, despite it being a long way from
home, because it offered free treatment and quality medicines.
The administration offers free dengue treatment at 17 hospitals in
the city. However, many of them, including Tarakan, Koja in North
Jakarta and Fatmawati in South Jakarta, receive more than their fair
share of patients due to their location.
Jakarta Health Agency deputy head Salimar Salim said the constant
stream of dengue cases was the result of longer transition periods
between the rainy and dry seasons in the past 4 years. She said that
as a result, mosquito breeding was almost continuous.
People's poor living conditions, she added, also contributed to the
mounting number of cases. "People may clean up their houses and their
gutters, but there's a mound of garbage only meters away from their
house. This too can potentially be a nesting place for mosquitoes
after it rains." The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito can fly 100 meters
away from where it breeds and spread the fever, she added.
Efforts to curb dengue, Salimar said, required commitment from all
levels of the community as well as the administration. The head of
City Council Commission for social welfare, Dani Anwar, said the
rapid growth in the number of dengue cases and the resurgence of bird
flu in the city exposed the low hygiene standards that many residents
had, as disease outbreaks tended to be associated with slum
areas. He said the time was ripe for the administration to make a
bylaw on environmental standards in the city. "We have to be more
disciplined about hygiene. It is time to punish those who have filthy
houses or pollute the environment."

Dengue claims 13 lives this month in Malaysia
-----------------------------------------------
Dengue fever has claimed 13 lives in barely one month in Malaysia
this year, a senior health official said Wed 24 Jan 2007.
Deputy Health Director-General Ramlee Rahma said 5 more dengue fever
deaths were reported in Selangor state in the 3rd week of this year
[2007], bringing the total death toll to 13 nationwide. In the 3rd
week of this January, Malaysia has reported 1423 suspected cases, of
which 403 have been confirmed as dengue fever. Ramlee said Selangor
and Kuala Lumpur remained the places with the biggest number of cases
reported. For the 3rd week of this month [January 2007], Selangor
reported 574 suspected cases while Kuala Lumpur recorded 312 cases,
Ramlee said in a statement released here.
The health ministry has carried out several preventive and control
measures throughout the country, especially in the 2 hot spots, said Ramlee.
He added the ministry is still distributing the pesticide free to the
public and has also roped in 60 health officers from other states to
help contain the cases in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur.

Official Alarm for Dengue in Puerto Vallarta
-----------------------------------------------
The Secretary of Health of Jalisco [state] is calling for urgent
intervention in Puerto Vallarta because actions so far have not been
adequate to control the dengue outbreak, indicating that 2007 is a
year of greater risk of dissemination of the disease.
The Director General of the Public Health Secretariat for Jalisco,
Gerardo Salvador Paredes Romero, confirmed that the 1st cases of
dengue in 2007 have been reported. Of a total of 109 people affected,
101 were from Puerto Vallarta, and of these, 20 had DHF.
As of last year [2006], Puerto Vallarta has been the municipality
most affected by dengue outbreaks. In 2006, 1107 cases were recorded
in this tourist destination (of a total of 1851 in the entire state
of Jalisco). Although there has been an intensification of [control]
actions, including fogging [with insecticides] of the municipality,
the official said, "This has not been sufficient to control the outbreak."
Beginning on Monday [29 Jan 2007] a "rapid response plan" will be
launched, with the participation of the federal Secretariat of
Health, the municipal government and with businesses. Paredes Romero
said that efforts will be redoubled and will proceed along 3 lines:
fogging [with insecticide] to kill adult [mosquitoes], use of abate
[larvacide] to eliminate breeding, and getting citizens to clean up
their patios and properties to avoid proliferation of new breeding
sites. Fogging in Puerto Vallarta and surrounding urban areas will
cover an area that includes 53 000 residences with a population of
220 000 inhabitants.
Implementation of this plan will cost 4 million pesos [USD 400 000]
and take a month, with weekly fogging.

[This is an example of how an epidemic disease, such as dengue,
potentially can have serious economic consequences in a popular
tourist destination, especially now, at the height of the tourist
season. Should dengue become a serious problem, once the word gets
out tourists will stay away in droves. ProMED will be very interested
to know how effective these vector control measures are, and wish the
state and federal health authorities success in controlling the
outbreak in a timely way.

WHO describes dengue fever as a severe, flu-like illness that affects
infants, young children, and adults but is seldom fatal. The clinical
features of dengue fever vary according to the age of the patient.
Infants and young children may have a non-specific febrile illness
with rash (although some infants and very young children may develop
shock syndrome, with sudden loss of circulating fluid volume, and
die). Older children and adults may have either a mild febrile
syndrome or the classical incapacitating disease, with abrupt onset
and high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and
joint pains, and rash.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a potentially deadly complication that is
characterized by high fever, hemorrhagic phenomena -- often with
enlargement of the liver -- and in severe cases, circulatory failure.
The illness commonly begins with a sudden rise in temperature
accompanied by facial flush and other non-specific constitutional
symptoms of dengue fever. The fever usually continues for 2 to 7 days
and can be as high as 40-41 C (104-105.8 F), possibly with febrile
convulsions and hemorrhagic phenomena. In moderate DHF cases, all
signs and symptoms abate after the fever subsides. In severe cases,
the patient's condition may suddenly deteriorate after a few days of
fever; the temperature drops, followed by signs of circulatory
failure, and the patient may rapidly go into a critical state of
shock and die within 12-24 hours or quickly recover following
appropriate volume replacement therapy. There is no specific
treatment for dengue fever. However, careful clinical management by
experienced physicians and nurses frequently saves the lives of DHF
patients. With appropriate intensive supportive therapy, mortality
may be reduced to less than one per cent. Maintenance of the
circulating fluid volume is the central feature of DHF case
management. (Abstracted from the WHO website fact sheet on dengue:
