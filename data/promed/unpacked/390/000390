The changing epidemiology of diphtheria in the United Kingdom, 2009 to 2017
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gower CM, Scobie A, Fry NK, Litt DJ, et al.

Abstract
--------
Background. Diphtheria is a potentially fatal disease caused by toxigenic strains of _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _C. ulcerans_, or _C. pseudotuberculosis_.

Aim. Our objective was to review the epidemiology of diphtheria in the United Kingdom (UK) and the impact of recent changes in public health management and surveillance.

Methods. Putative human toxigenic diphtheria isolates in the UK are sent for species confirmation and toxigenicity testing to the National Reference Laboratory. Clinical, epidemiological, and microbiological information for toxigenic cases between 2009 and 2017 are described in this population-based prospective surveillance study.

Results. There were 33 toxigenic cases of diphtheria aged 4-82 years. Causative species were _C. diphtheriae_ (n = 18) and _C. ulcerans_ (n = 15). Most _C. diphtheriae_ cases were cutaneous (14/18) while more than half of _C. ulcerans_ cases had respiratory presentations (8/15); 2/3 (23/33) of cases were inadequately immunised. Two cases with _C. ulcerans_ infections died, both inadequately immunised. The major risk factor for _C. diphtheriae_ aquisition was travel to an endemic area, and for _C. ulcerans_, contact with a companion animal. Most confirmed _C. diphtheriae_ or _C. ulcerans_ isolates (441/507; 87%) submitted for toxigenicity testing were non-toxigenic, however, toxin positivity rates were higher (15/23) for _C. ulcerans_ than _C. diphtheriae_ (18/469). Ten non-toxigenic toxin gene-bearing (NTTB) _C. diphtheriae_ were also detected.

Conclusion. Diphtheria is a rare disease in the UK. In the last decade, milder cutaneous _C. diphtheriae_ cases have become more frequent. Incomplete vaccination status was strongly associated with the risk of hospitalisation and death.

Introduction
------------
Diphtheria was once one of the most feared childhood diseases in the United Kingdom (UK), with ca 60 000 cases per year, but dramatically reduced following introduction of mass immunisation in 1942 [1]. Diphtheria vaccine is made from inactivated diphtheria toxin and protects individuals from the effects of toxin-producing corynebacteria. In the UK, diphtheria toxoid is included in the immunisation schedule at 2, 3, and 4 months of age followed by 2 boosters (at approximately 3 and 14 years of age), with further boosters recommended for travel and as part of the maternal pertussis immunisation programme following inclusion in the pertussis booster vaccine [1]. In addition, CRM197-containing vaccines (a non-toxigenic mutant of diphtheria toxin used as a carrier protein in some conjugate vaccines such as pneumococcal conjugate vaccine), provide additional boosting of diphtheria antibodies in the population [2].

Diphtheria vaccine coverage in the UK remains high; coverage of the primary course evaluated at 1 and 2 years of age has been between 91% and 95% since the early 1990s. Assessment of preschool booster coverage started in 1999/2000; coverage remained between 78% and 82% during the following decade, before increasing to 86% in 2009/2010 and remaining between 86% and 89% since [3]. Coverage assessment of the adolescent booster began in 2016 and is ca 85% [4]. The last UK seroprevalence study in 2009 found that 75% of the population had antibody levels greater than or equal to 0.01 IU/mL, correlating with basic diphtheria protection [2]. The highest number of susceptible individuals were observed in under one-year-olds (37%), 35-44-year-olds (27%), 45-69-year-olds (41%), and those older than 70 years (33%), perhaps reflecting a combination of waning immunity and fewer doses offered in earlier schedules [2].

Three _Corynebacterium_ species can potentially produce diphtheria exotoxin: _C. diphtheriae_ (associated with epidemic person-to-person spread via respiratory droplets and close contact), _C. ulcerans_ (traditionally associated with farm animal contact and dairy products), and _C. pseudotuberculosis_ (which rarely infects humans and is typically associated with farm animals, particularly ruminants) [5,6]. Classical respiratory diphtheria is characterised by the formation of an adherent grey-white pseudomembrane in the throat [1,7]. Milder respiratory disease may manifest as a sore throat and is most commonly seen in fully or partially vaccinated individuals. Diphtheria may also present with cutaneous lesions, characterised by rolled-edge ulcers usually on exposed limbs, particularly the legs, and is more common in tropical regions. The mode of transmission of cutaneous diphtheria is through direct contact with lesions or infected secretions with some evidence suggesting it may be more transmissible than respiratory diphtheria [7]. Patients may exhibit both cutaneous and respiratory disease at the same time, whether caused by _C. diphtheriae_ or _C. ulcerans_ [8]. _C. ulcerans_ has a broad host range and has been isolated from clinically affected and healthy wild, farm, zoo, research, and domesticated animals, as reviewed by Tiwari et al. [9].

Severe clinical cases of respiratory diphtheria require rapid administration of diphtheria antitoxin (a concentrated immunoglobulin preparation prepared from horse serum, that neutralises circulating toxin), as well as antibiotics to clear the bacterial infection [8]. However, economic factors as well as issues concerning regulations have led to poor availability of diphtheria antitoxin (DAT) in many countries [10,11], although it has been continuously available in the UK in limited supplies.

Revised guidelines for public health management and control of diphtheria in England published in 2015 included the availability of a rapid national PCR service for confirmation of identification of the toxigenic _Corynebacterium_ species and detection of the toxin gene (tox) in addition to the phenotypic Elek test, to enable faster public health action [7]. The availability of both PCR and Elek testing has identified a number of _C. diphtheriae_ isolates carrying the tox gene (PCR-positive) but not expressing the toxin (Elek-negative), termed non-toxigenic toxin gene-bearing strains (NTTB) [12]. The pathogenesis and clinical significance of isolation of this organism are not well understood; in particular they are not known to cause diphtheria (which is due to action of the toxin), and patients are therefore not treated with antitoxin. However, owing to their potential (currently unquantifiable) risk of becoming toxigenic through a genetic event, it is currently recommended in the UK that they are managed in the same way as fully toxigenic (i.e., Elek-positive, toxin-expressing) diphtheria cases and eliminated using antibiotics from patients and contacts [7].

The last review of UK diphtheria cases from 1986 to 2008 highlighted the changing epidemiology with 2/3 of toxigenic infections being indigenously acquired _C. ulcerans_ rather than imported _C. diphtheriae_. Similar trends of increasing _C. ulcerans_ cases were reported in other western European countries [5]. We present an updated epidemiological analysis of diphtheria in the UK based on surveillance and laboratory testing of all _C. diphtheriae_ and _C. ulcerans_ isolates from 2009 until 2017 and following the availability of a rapid national PCR service to assess the impact of changes in the surveillance system and inform public health risk assessment and practice.

Conclusion
-----------
Although diphtheria is rare in the UK, it can cause severe and potentially fatal disease in inadequately immunised individuals, and clinicians should be aware of the need for early assessment for antitoxin in suspected cases. There is a risk of _C. diphtheriae_ acquisition from travel to endemic regions, and _C. ulcerans_ continues to emerge as an indigenous zoonotic pathogen in the UK. The low overall incidence of diphtheria in the UK population, and the shift towards identifying milder cutaneous disease demonstrate the continued success and importance of the diphtheria vaccination and surveillance programme; sustaining high vaccination coverage remains a key priority.

[_Corynebacterium diphtheriae__ is an aerobic gram-positive bacillus that causes respiratory tract or cutaneous diphtheria. Toxin production occurs only when the bacillus is infected (lysogenized) by a specific bacteriophage that carries the gene encoding the toxin. The toxin is responsible for the major complications, myocarditis (e.g., cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure), and neuritis (e.g., paralysis of the soft palate, eye muscles, limbs, and diaphragm). _C. ulcerans_ and _C. pseudotuberculosis_ can also harbor diphtheria toxin genes and cause zoonotic infection in humans (http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/prevguid/m0051752/m0051752.asp).

Non-toxin-producing strains may cause mild to moderate pharyngitis. Although either toxigenic or nontoxigenic strains can cause cutaneous diphtheria, toxic cardiac or neurologic manifestations are uncommon. In the United States, cutaneous diphtheria, although not reportable, has been often associated with homeless persons (poor sanitation, poverty, and crowded living conditions) (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/dip.pdf). Acquisition of _C. diphtheriae_ can occur even in vaccinated contacts, since vaccine-induced immunity is anti-toxin.

Humans are the only reservoir of _C. diphtheriae_. Transmission of _C. diphtheriae_ can occur through respiratory droplets, direct contact with cutaneous infections, and articles soiled with discharges from the respiratory tract or skin lesions. Organisms can be shed for up to 4 weeks without antibiotics, but chronic carriers may shed organisms for 6 months or more. Effective antibiotic therapy promptly terminates shedding. The organisms can survive in dust and clothing for up to 6 months (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/dip.pdf). Shedding from cutaneous lesions can cause respiratory and cutaneous infections in contacts. - Mod.ML
