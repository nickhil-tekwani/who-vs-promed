Media Blackout as Pig-Borne Disease Spreads
-----------------------------------------------
Authorities in the southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan have issued a
media blackout order regarding a fatal pig-borne disease, which has now
spread to 10 cities, with at least 200 infections and dozens of fatalities.
"The death toll of the pig-borne endemic...had reached 37 as of 12:00 a.m.
Tue 9 Aug 2005, with one new death reported, according to the Chinese
Ministry of Health," China's official Xinhua news agency reported.
Xinhua's is currently the only version of events available to both Chinese
and overseas reporters alike, according to Hong Kong reporters in Sichuan.
"A circular has been issued by the Sichuan Provincial Propaganda
Department...which forbids local press from sending reporters to the
infected areas or hospitals," the Chinese-language newspaper, Ming Pao,
reported. "No amendments of Xinhua reports are allowed, including the
headline," the paper said, citing local Chinese reporters. It said that
reports that the mystery disease, which is said by Chinese health
authorities to be caused by a bacterium called _Streptococcus suis_ type 2,
had reached the provincial capital of Chengdu had been relegated to the
inside pages of the top provincial newspapers.
According to Xinhua, 205 cases of the disease had been reported as of Tue 9
Aug 2005, with 159 confirmed and 46 suspected. 18 people had been
discharged from the hospital, and 29 others were in critical condition, the
agency said.
An official with the Western Pacific arm of the World Health Organization
(WHO) called the outbreak "very unusual." "Well, at this time we are not
really part of the team that is in Sichuan, ... but it is, of course, of
concern to China and to us that there are so many cases [in] this outbreak.
This is a highly unusual outbreak," the WHO spokesman said.
Former senior doctor at the Provincial People's Hospital in the northern
province of Shaanxi, Jin Fushen, told RFA's Mandarin service that he
couldn't say for sure why the local authorities had banned reporters from
covering the outbreak. "I think there are 2 aspects to this. One is that
they don't want the journalists to spread the disease [_S. suis_ does not
spread from person-to-person. - Mod.LL]. The other is that they don't want
the journalists to report on the reason that the disease is spreading," Jin
told RFA reporter Yang Jiadai.
"But it's not really right not to let them go into the affected
area...They're not likely to exaggerate the threat. Journalists have a
responsibility. It's their job to report objectively and truthfully what is
happening," he said.
He said local journalists could play a helpful role for the government in
helping to control this outbreak, which needed to be contained within a 10
km radius of all known infections.
"In China, farming families revolve around their pigs and cattle. There are
many families who raise pigs. So if the 10 km rule is not followed, more
infections are going to result."
And a former senior doctor at the Xuanwu District People's Hospital in
Beijing, Yu Jianmei, said that, during an outbreak of disease, the Chinese
health authorities should understand very well the need not to keep the
public in the dark. But in the heat of the moment, local officials were apt
to see social stability as more important than anything, she said. "There
are guidelines for outbreaks of disease, what to do, how to react, whether
it's from a point of view of epidemiology, or from a public health
perspective."

[It is not clear whether the lack of reports of new cases results from
there actually being no new cases, or, rather, from the news blackout. -
