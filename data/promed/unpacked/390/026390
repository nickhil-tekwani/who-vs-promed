Antibody infusions seen as a way to combat equine infectious anemia in horses.

Modeling by scientists suggests the virus behind equine infectious anemia could be cleared from horses through repeated vaccination with antibodies.

Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) primarily infects horses. It shares many characteristics with HIV in humans, including its viral structure, genome, life cycle, and transmission via blood.

The virus establishes a persistent infection and is transmitted between horses by biting flies. There is no current vaccine or treatment, and infected horses enter a lifelong carrier state if they survive the acute phase of the infection.

The disease is found widely throughout the world, with many jurisdictions requiring euthanasia of infected horses.

Researchers Elissa Schwartz, Christian Costris-Vas, and Stacey Smith described the infection as a substantial concern for equine health worldwide, being 1 of only 11 equid infections requiring reporting to the World Organization for Animal Health.

Recent outbreaks have been reported in North America, South America, Asia, and throughout Europe.

Genetically diverse strains of the virus have been found. Infection typically consists of 3 stages: An acute stage characterised by high fever and a low platelet count; a chronic stage with spiking viral loads, recurring fevers, and weight loss; and a symptom-free phase with a decreased viral load and an absence of apparent clinical signs.

"One of the reasons these viruses are difficult to control is because mutation allows them to escape from therapies and immune responses," the trio said. "We need to better understand how antibodies can control EIAV infection when the virus mutates."

The study team, writing in the journal Viruses, said research has shown protection against the virus can be achieved in horses with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) through 3 infusions of processed plasma from long-term immunocompetent horses infected by the virus.

They noted vaccination of horses by infusion of plasma-containing EIAV-specific antibodies is not a treatment under development. Indeed, the plasma infusion work in SCID horses was undertaken to gain insights into vaccine development for HIV infection in humans.

The potential for antibody infusions to control EIAV holds great promise for the potential elimination of other lentiviruses, such as HIV, they said. However, the usefulness of this approach is limited by the potential for mutant escape.

The study team applied mathematical modeling, taking into account ongoing mutation and the relationship between growth and antibody control, to determine whether multiple infusions had the potential to eliminate the virus in horses altogether.

The work showed 7 infusions of an antibody vaccine, provided they are properly timed, are sufficient to eradicate both the wild-type and the mutant strains of the virus in a horse.

"This suggests a route forward for viral control not only of EIAV but for other virus infections in which escape by neutralisation-resistant mutants is a concern," they said.

Schwartz is with Washington State University; Costris-Vas and Stacey Smith are with the University of Ottawa.

[The potential of this novel therapy for helping owners whose horses are affected by this horrible disease is a reason to celebrate. However, there is much yet to be determined. The article mentions 7 infusions, but what is the cost per infusion? Or is this a package deal of 7 infusions? How will regulatory officials view this? How long until this potential product is on the market? I see such infusions as being administered by veterinarians. Therefore, will this be a matter of reporting to the authorities that the horse in question has received its prescribed infusions at the prescribed time, as well as a subsequent negative test following treatment?

I see this as potentially the most hopeful treatment for EIAV ever offered to horses and their owners. I hope it will prove to be successful, find its way to market quite quickly, and be embraced and recommended by regulatory authorities. We will hope for a rapid clearance by regulatory authorities of this promising product. - Mod.TG]
