http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/02/news-scan-feb-24-2020

After additions of what might be retrospective cases, the World Health Organization's (WHO's) online Ebola dashboard shows a case count of 3444 today [24 Feb 2020], which represents 11 more cases than the total reported at the end of last week. The death toll now stands at 2264 in an outbreak that has lasted 18 months in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

In a new study published in Vaccine, researchers found that Ebola patients in the DRC who had received rVSV-ZEBOV prior to their infections had lower viral loads and better outcomes than unvaccinated Ebola patients. The study compared 44 patients vaccinated prior to admission to Ebola treatment centers in Butembo and Katwa from January through March of 2019 with 213 unvaccinated patients.

Ten (23%) of 44 vaccinated patients died, compared with 117 (55%) of 213 unvaccinated patients (odds ratio 0.24; 95% confidence interval 0.11 to 0.51, P less than 0.001), the study found. The vaccinated patients were also less likely to suffer kidney damage.

Citation: Kasereka MC et al.: Prior vaccination with recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus - Zaire Ebolavirus vaccine is associated with improved survival among patients with Ebolavirus infection. Vaccine. 21 Feb 2020. doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.02.044.

Abstract.
The 2nd-largest Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak ever recorded is currently ongoing in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This is the 1st outbreak for which the recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus - Zaire Ebolavirus (rVSV-ZEBOV) candidate vaccine has been widely administered, using a ring vaccination strategy. We examined whether prior vaccination with rVSV-ZEBOV impacts viral load, organ impairment, and survival among patients with EVD admitted to Ebola treatment units (ETUs) in the DRC. We conducted a retrospective observational study of patients admitted to the ETUs in Butembo and Katwa, eastern DRC, between 30 Mar and 10 Aug 2019. We included 257 patients, of whom 44 had been vaccinated prior to admission and 213 were unvaccinated. Vaccinated patients were admitted to the hospital sooner than unvaccinated patients (median 2 days (IQR 1.8-4) versus 4 days (IQR 3-6), p less than 0.001). Vaccinated patients had a lower viral load at admission compared to those who were unvaccinated: 6.0 log10 cp/mL (IQR 5.0-7.1) versus 6.9 log10 cp/mL (IQR 5.4-7.6), p = 0.017. In a longitudinal analysis of daily viral load measurements, vaccinated patients had an overall viremia 1.32 log10 cp/mL (95% CI 0.58-2.1) lower than unvaccinated patients over the course of their infection. Acute kidney injury at admission was less common in vaccinated patients: OR 0.44 (95% CI 0.20-0.94), p = 0.027. Mortality in vaccinated patients was 10/44 (23%) compared to 117/213 (55%) unvaccinated patients (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.11-0.51, p less than 0.001). In conclusion, prior rVSV-ZEBOV vaccination was associated with reduced severity of infection and improved survival among patients with confirmed EVD treated at ETUs in eastern DRC. These findings support the efficacy of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine in modulating EVD severity.
