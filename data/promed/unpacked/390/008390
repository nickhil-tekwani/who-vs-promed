The state Veterinarian's Office has now verified 30 cases of an invariably fatal horse illness transmitted by mosquitoes.

That is twice the amount of cases of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) found in South Carolina horses in 2012, according to Dr Adam C Eichelberger. He said Friday [16 Aug 2013] that 5 dead horses in the tri-county area [Sumter-Lee-Clarendon counties] have tested positive for the illness, which is fatal in about 1/3 of human cases.

The Centers for Disease Control has reported no human cases of the illness in South Carolina for the current year [2013]. Eichelberger said Lee County had its 1st confirmed equine case this past week [week of 17 Aug 2013]. Sumter, which now has 3 confirmed equine cases, was the 1st county to have a horse test positive this year.

Clarendon County has also had one horse die from the disease, which is maintained in nature through a bird-mosquito cycle, according to the CDC. The mosquitoes that carry the illness -- primarily the blacktailed mosquito -- feed on the blood of birds. The virus steadily increases throughout the summer as more mosquitoes feed on more birds and propagate the illness.

The mosquitoes then spread the illness from birds to horses, humans, other mammals, and even reptiles and amphibians.

"It's a particularly virulent illness in horses, killing about 9 out of 10 horses who get the disease," Eichelberger said. "Signs in horses typically develop between 2 and 5 days after exposure and include stumbling, circling, head pressing, depression or apprehension, weakness of legs, partial paralysis, the inability to stand and muscle twitching."

According to state veterinarian Dr Boyd Parr, 14 horses died of the disease in 2012. No human cases were verified that year. This year [2013], Georgia has confirmed one human case, while Florida has confirmed 2.

Symptoms in humans occur within 3 to 10 days after exposure and include high fever, muscle pain, altered mental status, headache, meningeal irritation, severe sensitivity to light, and seizures.

"If anyone has clinical signs where they suspect they may have been exposed to West Nile or EEE viruses, they should contact their human health care provider immediately," Eichelberger said. "Now that we know that there are mosquitoes in the area that have this disease, our biggest concern is making the public aware that they need to keep themselves and their animals safe."

According to Eichelberger, one major way tri-county residents can remain safe is by vaccinating horses against EEE and other mosquito-borne infections such as West Nile virus and monitoring mosquito activity near their homes.

"They can greatly reduce the number of mosquitoes by limiting places for standing water, even in as much as one-half inch," Eichelberger said, noting that mosquitoes can lay eggs in as little as a teaspoon of water.

Sumter County Vector Control Director Alan Penland, who said his trucks are still going out and spraying for mosquitoes each weeknight, added that flowerpots, buckets, tarps, or anything else that can accumulate water should be checked. Tire swings should have holes drilled in them to allow water to escape.

"Excessive brush on a property can also create an environment for mosquitoes," Penland said. "Bird baths and pet bowls should also be cleaned regularly to prevent mosquitoes from laying eggs in them."

Eichelberger reiterated that anyone feeling symptoms of EEE or West Nile virus, should see their family practitioner.

"We do not make medical diagnoses, nor do we treat humans," Eichelberger said. "A physician can do the proper testing for these illnesses and make treatment decisions."

The New Jersey Department of Agriculture has confirmed that a 7-year-old horse from Cape May County was euthanized on 3 Aug 2013, one day after showing neurologic signs consistent with eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), a serious, mosquito-borne illness in horses. Tests on the gelding concluded the animal was positive for EEE.

"Horse owners need to be vigilant in vaccinating their animals against diseases spread by mosquitoes," said New Jersey Secretary of Agriculture Douglas H Fisher. "Vaccinated animals are much less likely to contract deadly diseases such as EEE and West Nile virus."

The Cape May horse was obtained from a horse rescue 2 weeks prior to the onset of illness and the animal's vaccination history was unknown.

In 2012, New Jersey had 6 cases of EEE and 4 cases of West Nile virus (WNV) between June and October.

Effective equine vaccines for EEE and WNV are available commercially, and horse owners are advised to contact their veterinarians if their animals are not already up-to-date on their vaccinations against both EEE and WNV.

A viral disease, EEE affects the central nervous system and is transmitted to horses by infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs of EEE include moderate to high fever, depression, lack of appetite, cranial nerve deficits (facial paralysis, tongue weakness, difficulty swallowing), behavioral changes (aggression, self-mutilation, or drowsiness), gait abnormalities, or severe central nervous system signs, such as head-pressing, circling, blindness, and seizures.

The course of EEE can be swift, with death occurring 2 to 3 days after onset of clinical signs despite intensive care; fatality rates reach 75-80 percent among horses. Horses that survive might have long-lasting impairments and neurologic problems.

Cases of EEE and West Nile virus confirmed in New Jersey, like other viral diseases affecting horses' neurologic systems, must be reported to the state veterinarian at 609/671-6400 within 48 hours of diagnosis. The New Jersey Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory is available to assist with EEE and WNV testing and can be reached at 609/671-6999.

West Nile virus and EEE are both transmitted by mosquitoes. Horses cannot transmit either disease to their owners. However owners may be guilty of killing their pets if they fail to vaccinate the animals. A single vaccine protects against both of these mosquito-borne diseases.

In addition to vaccination, owners should be using appropriate fly and mosquito repellant for their horses. - Mod.TG]
