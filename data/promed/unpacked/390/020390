Urgent call for global fight against wheat killer
-------------------------------------------------
Representatives of major wheat producing countries have called for
urgent coordinated action to prevent and control wheat stem rust
strain Ug99. The fungus is capable of causing heavy damage to wheat
crops and is a major threat to food security. At the International
Conference on Wheat Stem Rust Ug99 in New Delhi (6-8 Nov 2008), 31
countries pledged to strongly support prevention and control of wheat
stem rust as a matter of national policy and international
cooperation. Countries should develop contingency plans to prevent
rust epidemics, share surveillance information and establish a global
early warning system. Breeding research should be intensified to
develop Ug99 resistant varieties.

The new virulent strain Ug99 has spread from East Africa to Yemen,
Sudan, and in late 2007 to Iran. Currently there is no evidence that
it has spread to any other country. A recent field survey showed that
Ug99 is not present in India, Pakistan, Egypt, and China. It is
estimated that as much as 80 percent of all wheat varieties planted
in Asia and Africa are susceptible to Ug99.

FAO [United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation] has recently
launched its Wheat Rust Disease Global Programme that supports 29
countries in East and North Africa, the Near East, and Central and
South Asia, that are either affected or at risk of the disease and
that account for 37 percent of global wheat production.

[Wheat stem rust is caused by the fungus _Puccinia graminis_ f. sp.
_tritici_. Stems can be completely girdled by the rust pustules and
some fields are totally destroyed. Resistance to stem rust in today's
wheats is based largely on the gene Sr31, and Ug99 emerged as a new
pathogen strain being able to overcome Sr31 resistance (for more
information on wheat stem rust and Ug99 see ProMED-mail post no.
20080307.0925). Rust spores are carried eastwards on prevailing winds
and regions at high risk of a Ug99 incursion have been identified
accordingly. It is estimated that Ug99 could reduce world wheat
production by 60 million tons. An even more virulent variant able to
overcome additional resistance genes has recently emerged in Kenya,
and this increases the threat to global wheat production even further.
