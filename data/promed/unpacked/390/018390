Within the framework of the epidemiological surveillance of the novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the Ministry of Health (MOH) has announced that 2 confirmed cases of the virus have been recorded. The 1st case is a 26-year-old Saudi male who was in contact with one of the previously confirmed cases reported in Asir. The 2nd case is a 42-year-old female resident working at a health department in Asir. Both cases have mild symptoms that did not require their admission to the hospital.

The MOH has tested 1460 samples since the start of the previous month of Sha'ban [10 Jun 2013 to 8 Jul 2013], and all were tested negative except the cases that have been published.

[The addition of these 2 cases will raise the global total of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection to 84 including 45 deaths. Of cases confirmed in Saudi Arabia, there are now 68 cases including 38 deaths. It appears that both cases are most likely contact cases, the 1st (the 26 year old male) is identified as having contact with the previously confirmed case from Asir (see prior ProMED-mail post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (41): Saudi Arabia, WHO 20130710.1815512). The 2nd case, the female resident working at a health department in Asir, suggests there may have been contact in the healthcare environment.
