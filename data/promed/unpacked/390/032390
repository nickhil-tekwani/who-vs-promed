An emerging virus, _Colombian datura virus_ (CDV; genus _Potyvirus_),
might present a risk to solanaceous crops. CDV was 1st isolated and
described in 1968 from _Datura_ species imported from Colombia to the
USA. It is transmitted by aphids (including _Myzus persicae_) in a
non-persistent manner, as well as by mechanical inoculation and
grafting. Symptoms of CDV can include reduction in leaf size, vein
banding, chlorotic flecking followed by mottling, reduction of plant
size and occasionally flower discolouration. CDV infections may
remain symptomless, but when plants are stressed, leaf mottling and
mosaic patterns may appear.

In 1996, CDV was reported to occur in Germany and the Netherlands on
ornamentals (_Brugmansia_, _Juanulloa_, _Petunia_) and tomato
(_Solanum lycopersicum_). In a glasshouse in the Netherlands,
approximately 300 tomato plants showed growth reduction, foliar
mosaic and fruit discolouration. Observations suggested these tomato
plants had probably been contaminated by aphids which had acquired
the virus from a large CDV-infected _Brugmansia_ plant in the same
glasshouse. In 2004, CDV infections were detected in tobacco
(_Nicotiana tabacum_) in Hungary, Germany and Poland. Affected plants
showed conspicuous chlorotic and necrotic leaf symptoms. In Hungary,
recent studies have showed that CDV caused severe diseases in
experimental fields of Cape gooseberry (_Physalis peruviana_) and was
found naturally infecting pepino (_Solanum muricatum_) plants.
Inoculation studies have shown that potato (_Solanum tuberosum_)
could be a potential host of CDV, but no natural infections have been reported.

In the USA, CDV was detected in 2003 and 2004 in symptomatic
ornamentals in several states (_Spiranthes_ orchids, _Brugmansia_).
Preliminary studies suggest that CDV is more widespread than
originally thought. In Australia, CDV was 1st detected in 2007 on
_Brugmansia_ in New South Wales, and subsequently in Victoria. CDV
isolates from Japan (tomato, 2004), USA (_Brugmansia_, 2007) and
Canada (2008) have been deposited in the GenBank database. However,
in the absence of any other supporting data, it is difficult to
assess the situation of the disease in these areas.

Although much data is lacking on the host range, geographical
distribution and more particularly on the economic impact of the
disease in solanaceous crops, it seems that CDV is emerging in
different parts of the world. More attention should probably be paid
to the health status of ornamental _Solanaceae_, as these may act as
inoculum sources for economically important crops.

[With the exception of _Spiranthes_, all species mentioned above
belong to genera within the dicot family of the _Solanacea_, which
also contains important crop species. _Gomphrena_ (dicot family of
_Amaranthaceae_) has also been found susceptible to CDV inoculation.
_Spiranthes_, however, belongs to the quite unrelated monocot family
of the _Orchidaceae_, and monocots have not otherwise been reported
as hosts of CDV. Thus, this reported detection may need further
confirmation, but if it can be verified, it may indicate a wide host
range of CDV and a potential threat to a wider range of crops.

The genus _Potyvirus_ is the largest of the plant virus genera and
contains many species that seriously affect a wide range of crop
plants. Disease management of aphid-transmitted viruses is often
difficult because the vectors are ubiquitous and difficult to
control. If resistant crop cultivars are available, these are usually
the most promising approach. Furthermore, some potyviruses can be
seed transmitted, and it is not known yet whether CDV belongs to this group.
