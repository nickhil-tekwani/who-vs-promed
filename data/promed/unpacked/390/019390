An extensive tour was conducted by Plant Health Clinic Jammu in wake of prevalent disease in maize crop. The team visited for on-the-spot assessment of maize crop condition. After a proper diagnosis, farmers were informed that the maize is suffering from bacterial stalk rot, which leads to lodging and ultimate poor grain filling and crop loss. Accurate control measures were also recommended to the farmers.

Widespread cases of bacterial stalk rot are being reported from [several areas in the state]. The farmers [were advised] to be careful next year [2021], as there is every chance of reoccurrence of disease, and sensitized about the preventive measures to be followed right from land preparation, seed treatment, to crop maturity. Proper use of potash was suggested against maize stalk rot.

[Bacterial stalk rot (BSR) of maize is caused by _Dickeya zeae_ (reclassified from _Pectobacterium_ and _Erwinia_) and possibly related species. The pathogen can also affect a range of other crops, including millets, sugar cane, rice, potato, and banana. Symptoms of BSR on maize usually start at the bottom of the stalk and may include rotting of stem internode tissue, wilting of leaves, top rot, and rot of the whole stalk, followed by collapse (lodging) and death of the plant. Infections in the upper parts of the plant affect tassel formation and seed set. Near-total crop losses have been reported. The disease is favoured by warm temperatures and humid conditions and often follows flooding of fields.

The bacteria survive in stalk residues above the soil surface for up to one year. Infection of the new crop occurs through natural openings or injuries of the plant epidermis. The bacteria can also be transmitted by mechanical means and with water. Direct plant-to-plant spread in a field is rare, but unspecific transmission by insect activities has been reported. Disease management may include cultural techniques (reduction of moisture), phytosanitation (removal of crop residue), and crop rotation with non-hosts. In glasshouse experiments, high doses of phosphorus and potassium ('potash' above is a crude mix of water-soluble potassium salts) have been reported to decrease BSR incidence. Sensitivity to BSR can vary in different crop varieties.

Brown stalk rot of maize is caused by bacterial species of genus _Pantoea_ (see ProMED-mail post 20070620.1993).
