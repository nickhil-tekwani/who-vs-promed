Hundreds of children at schools in Shropshire and Staffordshire have
been affected by [viral gastroenteritis]. Experts have said the
number of children affected was broadly in line with a winter virus
[i.e. infection with norovirus, known colloquially as "winter
vomiting virus"]. Symptoms suffered by those affected included
vomiting, high fevers, diarrhoea and lethargy. At its height on Wed 1
Feb 2006, 10 [primary and junior] schools in the area were closed.
Birmingham City Council said 6 schools are still closed on Thu 2 Feb 2006.
In the Black Country, Moat Farm Infants School in Oldbury, Annie
Lennards Infants and Uplands Manor Primary, both in Smethwick, were
also closed on Wednesday and remained shut on Thursday. Sandwell
Hamstead Junior School, which had been closed on Tuesday and
Wednesday with 120 pupils out of 270 affected, reopened on Thursday.
A spokesman for the council said: "Most children have been off school
for between 2 and 4 days, with only one child admitted to hospital.
We are currently aware of around 30 schools in the Birmingham area
that have reported high volumes of pupil absence due to sickness.
However as this [notovirus infection] is not a notifiable disease,
schools may not have contacted the Health Protection Unit."
Meanwhile in Staffordshire nearly 300 pupils at the Sir Graham
Balfour School in Stafford have been off ill with the winter sickness
bug and a further 200 have been affected at William Brookes School in
Much Wenlock, Shropshire. Parents are being urged to ensure their
children are symptom-free for at least 24 hours before returning to school.
Wolverhampton's New Cross Hospital is also asking anyone who has been
in contact with people with the virus not to visit patients.

[ProMED-mail no longer routinely reports outbreaks of norovirus
infection -- see: Norovirus outbreak - New Zealand (Dunedin): susp.
20060131.0316 -- but this outbreak is exceptional in its extent. An
updated report from BBC News online later in the day
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/west_midlands/4675082.stm>,
submitted by Dr Keith Marshall <kcm@cix.co.uk>, indicates that the
illness is spreading and the number of primary and junior schools
affected in Birmingham is now given as 18. Overall up to 40 schools
have been affected, with 17 expected to be closed on Fri 3 Feb 2006
and some already announcing they will stay shut into next week. The
number of schools closed has risen throughout the week. The outbreak
has also affected schools in parts of the Black Country, Shropshire
and Staffordshire. The symptoms suffered includes vomiting, high
fevers, diarrhoea and lethargy. Birmingham City Council said most
children have been off school between 2 and 4 days, with one child
admitted to hospital. Parents of affected children have been advised
to keep their children off school, make sure they rest and drink
plenty of fluids, use paracetamol and/or ibuprofen to reduce high
temperatures and keep good hand hygiene. - Mod.CP]
