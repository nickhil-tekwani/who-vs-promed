Saskatchewan: West Nile Virus-positive Blood donor is First Human Case
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Saskatchewan has confirmed Canada's first domestic case of West Nile virus
in a human this year. It is also the first time a person has contracted the
virus in Saskatchewan. Provincial health officials announced the case on
Fri 25 Jul 2003, saying only that the person was from Assiniboia, 130
kilometres southwest of Regina. They did not give the person's age or say
whether the person was male or female. However, sources say the person is a
man.
"Fortunately this person is one of the majority who didn't get ill," said
Eric Young, Saskatchewan's deputy chief medical officer. "However, I think
it just brings home the fact that people have to take precautions, they
have to take the potential for West Nile seriously and they have to do the
things they can to reduce that risk."
On Thursday, Ontario officials announced that province's first probable
case of the 2003 season but said the person likely contracted the disease
while on a trip to the United States. "We knew it was only a matter of time
before someone in Saskatchewan became infected," said Dr. Ross Findlater,
the province's chief medical health officer. "We are entering a period
where there are more of the mosquitoes that carry West Nile virus."
The virus was found in a unit of blood donated in the province on Tuesday,
the Canadian Blood Services reported in a news release. "He was well when
he donated and remains well," said Ted Alport, medical director of Canadian
Blood Services Saskatchewan. Once the blood tested positive for the virus,
it was withdrawn from inventory and the donor, who has been notified, will
not be eligible to donate blood again for 56 days, at which time the virus
will no longer be present.
"This result shows that our West Nile virus test is doing exactly what it
was designed to do -- helping reduce the risk that the virus will enter the
blood supply," Dr. Graham Sher, chief executive officer of Canadian Blood
Services, said in the release. But since this person had no symptoms, Dr.
Donald Low, a leading expert in infectious diseases, said he expects this
is simply the first detected case of a person contracting West Nile virus
infection, not the only person to have the disease. "If we've detected one
case in a blood donor, then we're sure that there are more cases out there
that have gone unrecognized," said Low, a microbiologist at Mount Sinai
Hospital in Toronto.
There were 416 probable or confirmed cases of West Nile virus in Canada in
2002, although officials acknowledge that was probably just the tip of the
iceberg. It's believed 80 percent of people who get the virus have such
mild symptoms they aren't even aware they've been infected. Dr. Mike
Drebot, head of the viral zoonosis section of Health Canada's National
Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, said it is difficult to predict what
the Saskatchewan case means for the province or the rest of Canada. "We may
see cases in a number of provinces or maybe we'll see the majority of cases
in only one or 2 provinces -- it's really difficult to say. "But the risk
for cases wherever we've detected West Nile activity, and this ranges from
Alberta even to New Brunswick, is there. Although in certain jurisdictions,
the risk may be higher than in others.
"I would hope that with all the public education that's been done as well
as mosquito abatement procedures, that we'll be able to dampen the risk and
we'll see fewer human cases than we saw last year." Last year, 20 deaths
were attributed to West Nile virus infection in Canada: 18 in Ontario and 2
in Quebec. The 2 were the only provinces that recorded domestically
acquired cases of the disease in 2002, the first year there were human
cases in this country. 8 U.S. states have already reported a total of 12
human cases of West Nile virus so far this year: Alabama, Ohio, Texas,
South Carolina, South Dakota, Minnesota, Colorado, and Iowa.
Birds play a pivotal role in the buildup of the virus in an area. Early in
the season, mosquitoes become infected by feeding on infected birds. The
mosquitoes then transmit the virus to other birds, building up a critical
mass of virus in an area. That process is called amplification. When
sufficient amounts of virus are found in the bird and mosquito populations
of an area, mosquitoes that feed mainly on people can also become infected,
transferring the virus into the human population.
To date, 69 dead birds have tested positive for West Nile virus in Manitoba
and another 39 in Ontario. Dead birds have also tested positive for the
virus in New Brunswick (one), Saskatchewan (17), Quebec (8) and Alberta (3).

[This circumstance mirrors the American experience (in the states of
Colorado and Florida): that the surveillance of donations by blood banks is
proving to be a sensitive indicator of the presence of West Nile virus
infection in the human population, well before the first symptomatic cases
make their appearance. In the Canadian situation, the surveillance of blood
donations has revealed the first human case of West Nile virus infection in
the province of Saskatchewan in the absence of overt disease. - Mod.CP]

is: so much for sentinel chickens... sentinel chicks may be better! - Mod.MPP]
