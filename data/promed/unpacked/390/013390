Research Provides Clues to 1997 'Bird Flu' Outbreak
---------------------------------------------------
NEW YORK: Recent outbreaks of [avian influenza] "bird flu" in Hong Kong did
not spread to people as [the outbreak] in 1997 did, but studying these
outbreaks help scientists understand how viruses jump from birds to humans.
During the 1997 outbreak, 6 people died after being infected with a strain
of influenza virus that previously had infected only birds. To control the
spread of the virus, more than 1.5 million chickens and other poultry were
slaughtered in the Hong Kong area. Since the 1997 outbreak, Hong Kong has
taken several steps to reduce the risk of another outbreak. Geese and ducks
are now slaughtered at a central facility to keep viruses from spreading to
chicken and other poultry. The 1997 virus is thought to have originated in
geese and other birds that live in water and to have crossed over to
land-living birds.
Although the virus that caused the 1997 outbreak has not reappeared in the
region, several viruses believed to be precursors of the species-jumping
virus have been detected, according to a report in the June 25th issue of
the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [ref: Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences 2002;99:8950-8955; online 19 Jun 2002
<http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/132268999v1>]. In fact, between
Feb and May 2001, several of these viruses moved from geese and ducks to
chicken and other land poultry, leading to an outbreak of disease in Hong
Kong markets.
The viruses found in 2001 "were not the same as those found causing disease
in man in 1997," according to J.S.M. Peiris, one of the researchers
involved in the study. The 1997 virus was unique in that it was an avian,
or bird, virus that directly infected and caused serious illness in people,
Peiris said. Even though there were no documented cases of human infection
with the bird viruses detected recently, Peiris and colleagues found signs
that the viruses had changed in certain ways to make it possible to move
from geese and ducks to chicken and other poultry. These changes could have
also occurred in the early development of the 1997 virus, according to the
researchers. The 2001 viruses were able to infect mice and spread to the
brain, which [avian influenza] viruses normally are not capable of
doing. These unusual qualities of the virus do not prove that they could
infect humans, but they do raise concerns, the authors report.
Unlike in 1997, in 2001, and during a more recent case in 2002,
surveillance of poultry markets provided an early warning, so the outbreak
was kept under control. But the researchers note, "Measures in Hong Kong
are not likely to reduce the possibility of such a virus arising in the
wider region of East Asia including southern China that has been recognized
as an influenza epicenter."

[The PNAS paper referred to above is entitled: "Emergence of multiple
genotypes of H5N1 avian influenza viruses in Hong Kong SAR," and is
authored by Y. Guan , J. S. M. Peiris , A. S. Lipatov, T. M. Ellis, K. C.
Dyrting, S. Krauss, L. J. Zhang, R. G. Webster, and K. F. Shortridge. The
abstract of the paper states that: Although A/Hong Kong/156/97
(H5N1/97)-like viruses associated with the "bird flu" incident in Hong Kong
SAR have not been detected since the slaughter of poultry in 1997, its
putative precursors continue to persist in the region. One of these,
Goose/Guangdong/1/96 (H5N1 Gs/Gd)-like viruses, reassorted with other avian
viruses to generate multiple genotypes of H5N1 viruses that crossed to
chickens and other terrestrial poultry from its reservoir in geese. Whereas
none of these recent reassortants had acquired the gene constellation of
H5N1/97, these events provide insight into how such a virus may have been
generated. The recent H5N1 reassortants readily infect and kill chicken and
quail after experimental infection, and some were associated with
significant mortality of chickens within the poultry retail markets in Hong
Kong. Some genotypes are lethal for mice after intra-nasal inoculation and
spread to the brain. On this occasion, the early detection of H5N1 viruses
in the retail, live poultry markets led to preemptive intervention before
the occurrence of human disease, but these newly emerging, highly
pathogenic H5N1 viruses provide cause for pandemic concern.
This study confirms the inference that H5N1-type influenza viruses with
novel combinations of other genes are being continuously generated by
reassortment from the pool of influenza viruses present in wild and
domesticated birds in the South China area and that the poultry markets of
the Hong Kong SAR provide a convenient focus for surveillance of new
strains of H5N1 (and other antigenic types) with potential for spread in
non-avian hosts. - Mod.CP]
