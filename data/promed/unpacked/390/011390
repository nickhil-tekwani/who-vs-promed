Comment on vector ecology
-------------------------
The information from Dr. Aldis is appreciated. Regarding the possibility of
establishment of the virus in the Freetown area, it is well to remember
that the main reason this may not happen is that _Rattus_ likely holds the
city and actively excludes _Mastomys_. But the edges of the city might turn
out to resemble villages in the interior where the Lassa carrier invaded
from the bush to set up business in the absence of major _Rattus_
populations. Thus it will be worth watching the fringes of the capitol
carefully.
