Poultry industry makes plea to suppress flu details
---------------------------------------------------
In the wake of an economically devastating avian flu outbreak in the
Delmarva region [the Eastern seaboard states of Delaware, Maryland, and
Virginia] in 2004, poultry producers asked lawmakers Friday for legislation
to conceal the identity of infected farms, saying they want to avoid
panicked embargoes by overseas purchasers.
However, secrecy would also limit the ability of non-government officials
to monitor disease spread, potentially placing human populations at risk.
At a meeting of the Eastern Shore delegation to the General Assembly on
Friday, Bill Satterfield, executive director of Delmarva Poultry Industry
Inc., asked state legislators to support HB76, authorizing civil penalties
for people who violate animal health regulations, and HB104, protecting the
identity of infected farms.
And the industry sought to assure the legislators that they are doing all
they can to ensure safety at their farms.
"We're now working with county health departments and other states to
protect workers against avian influenza," said Ron Darnell, Delmarva
Poultry Industry Inc. president.
[Maryland State] Delegate D. Page Elmore, R-38A-Wicomico [Republican,
District 38A, Wicomico County], asked another lawmaker to research the
question of trade sanctions and export bans.
The strain of flu that infected Delmarva poultry in 2004 -- H7N2 -- is not
very virulent. Only 2 poultry workers of hundreds tested showed signs of
having been infected with the disease.
However, in Southeast Asia, other strains of avian flu have long been known
to spread to -- and kill -- humans in close contact with poultry.
Recently a young Vietnamese girl died of a different strain of avian flu,
H5N1, after contact with poultry. Her mother and aunt, who had no direct
contact with poultry, then became sick, and the mother died, raising fears
that the flu had evolved into a form transmissible from human to human with
the potential of causing a pandemic, according to recent news reports.
Outbreaks occurred in 1957 and 1968, possibly from flu that jumped from
birds to humans and then changed so it could move directly from human to
human, said Dr. Richard Slemons, Ohio State University professor of
veterinary medicine.
Slemons noted that the poultry industry is so vertically integrated that
even if Europe refuses to accept imports of American poultry for a week the
cost can be millions of dollars.
"Maryland and Delaware did a great job last year" containing the disease,
Slemons said. "We're due for another pandemic. The only thing that's
predictable is that (the viruses are) unpredictable."
There has been no recorded case of human-to-human transmission of avian flu
strains in North America, said Llelwyn Grant, Centers for Disease Control
spokesman.

[As a one-time civil servant with a number of governments (Canada, UK) and
the UN (FAO, PAHO) and latterly as a moderator for ProMED, I have witnessed
more than a few efforts by various agencies to suppress the release of
'bad' information. It is always counter-productive and makes a difficult
situation worse. Why?
Because such information always comes out eventually, either in the early
confusion or latterly, and it makes people angry and confrontational. The
rapid release of 'bad' news means that the person releasing it has control
of that news and journalists and others turn to that person or group for
follow-up information. How many of us want that to be a journalist who at
best may only know 40 percent of what actually happened? And a quick and
accurate release (and apology if necessary) makes for thin lawyers.
If those _responsible_ release the information 1st, it can ensure that the
information available is accurate, though it might have a distinct angle.
Also, in time, they gain respect and trust, and latterly some leeway
because there is a track record of their doing the best they can, maybe in
difficult circumstances.
It is interesting how a bad condition can be red-flagged by the sudden
absence of reports. We see this all the time with various governments, and
if they do it once, we begin to distrust what they do report; afterwards,
whatever they do is not enough to regain that confidence. Just think of the
Canadians and their honesty on BSE... because they were patently open,
their word is believed on a wider spectrum of activities.
And when information is suppressed it usually goes hand-in-hand with an
administration not improving the situation that facilitated the problem in
the first place, be it a disease outbreak, poor control efficiency,
emergence of new pathogens or increased problems with an old one, whatever.
It is a public certification of an ongoing mess.
While there is a fear that information and data will be abused by "others,"
this may be true in the short term, but it becomes balanced and frequently
sooner rather than later.
And to finally there is that apocryphal quote, "Get it out fast or do you
want to read about it on ProMED?" - Mod.MHJ]
