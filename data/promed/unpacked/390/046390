[This is a mite early for livestock anthrax cases in this part of the world. Normally anthrax in diagnosed in sheep only after a number have died -- a different pattern from cattle cases and it reflects the relative values of the animals affected. But we have a history here that this sheep was the only one at risk because it had not been vaccinated because it was a lamb when the stock was vaccinated, presumably in the Spring/early Summer of 2019. Possibly from a late birth.

But then how did it get infected. Sheep are gentle grazers and cases from grazing contaminated ground are known, though they are not significant soil eaters like cattle. There is no mention of anthrax cases on this holding in 2019. But it was early March, not late April or May. I wonder whether they were getting supplemental feed, which might have contained contaminated bone meal. This young sheep would have been the only one at risk as all the other sheep & castle had been vaccinated, albeit in the previous year and anthrax immunity is temporary, normally around 9 months at best, not permanent. - Mod.MHJ
