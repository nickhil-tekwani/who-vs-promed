Dutch authorities have reported a fresh outbreak of bird flu on a poultry farm in the west of the country but could not say whether it was the worrying new strain detected elsewhere in the Netherlands.

Avian influenza has been detected on a poultry farm at Zoeterwoude, where some 28 000 birds are affected, the economy ministry said in a statement on Sunday [30 Nov 2014]. The birds are infected with the H5 variant of the flu, but it is not yet known whether it is of the highly pathogenic variety or not, it added.

The highly infectious H5N8 strain of bird flu was discovered in the Netherlands 2 weeks ago, where authorities suspect it might have been brought in by birds migrating from Asia. Some strains of bird flu are fatal for chickens and pose a health threat to humans, who can fall sick after handling infected poultry. Dutch authorities have said human infection can only occur following intense and direct contact with infected birds.

The H5N1 strain of bird flu has killed more than 400 people, mainly in Southeast Asia, since 1st appearing in 2003. Another strain of bird flu, H7N9, has claimed more than 170 lives since emerging in 2013.

The latest outbreak came in a poultry farm about 21 miles (35 km) northwest of Hekendorp, where the 1st outbreak was detected in mid-November 2014, leading to around 150 000 birds being destroyed.

Bird flu has been detected in at least 3 other locations in the Netherlands and Germany; Britain has also reported similar strains of the virus.

Authorities on Sunday [30 Nov 2014] were destroying the birds at the site of the latest outbreak at Zoeterwoude and have set up a 6-mile (10-km) cordon around the farm; 4 other poultry farms in the area are being investigated for bird flu, authorities said.

The H7N7 strain of bird flu severely hit the Netherlands in 2003, with health authorities destroying about 30 million birds in an effort to limit the outbreak. There are 95 million chickens on Dutch poultry farms, and egg exports totaled 10.6 billion Euros [USD 13.20 billion] in 2011, according to the latest Dutch statistics.

[According to a press release published by the Dutch government today (30 Nov 2014), the affected farm in Zoeterwoude (west Netherlands, province South Holland) is a table-eggs production plant (layers) which has no outdoor access. Final laboratory results from the Central Veterinary Institute (Lelystad), addressing the virus strain's pathogenicity level and its N (neuraminidase) serotyping, are expected on 1 Dec 2014.

The press release indicated also that the animal health authorities have completed investigations in all duck farms throughout the Netherlands, concluding that no bird flu virus of the H5 type is currently present in any of them.
