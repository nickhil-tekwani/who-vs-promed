The presence of flesh-eating drug Krokodil has been confirmed in western Mexico as authorities announced that a Houston-based teen was treated for the side effects of the 'poor man's heroin' while [visiting relatives in Mexico], south of the border.

Doctors first thought that the 17-year-old was suffering from a sexually transmitted disease because the street drug had ruined her genitals. 'It wasn't sexually transmitted. She said she'd been using Krokodil for the last 2 months,' Jose Sotero Ruiz Hernandez of Mexico's National Institute of Migration told local paper El Periodico Correo.

'The young woman who used this drug had an infection that had rotted her genitals.' The victim has not been named and her status is unknown as she never returned to the clinic for a 2nd check in.

The head of the council on addictions in the western state of Jalisco, Dr Enrico Sotelo, said young woman is a resident of Houston, Texas and not Mexico.

She came to Mexico to visit the Pacific coast resort city of Puerto Vallarta where she has relatives, in November [2013].

Soon after, she checked into a local health clinic for digestive problems, and it was there that doctors detected the flesh lesions.

Dr Sotelo, who did not reveal the patient's name in accordance with privacy guidelines, said she told authorities she used the drug in Houston.

She acquired this problem with Krokodil in Houston [Texas, USA], not here in Puerto Vallarta [Jalisco, Mexico],' said Sotelo, who in any case has implemented an educational program to warn about the drug's ill effects.

Sotelo said a survey of rehab centers and clinics in Jalisco had revealed there were no other local cases.

He said so far, Mexico has detected only 2 probable cases, the woman in Puerto Vallarta and another person in the border state of Baja California. Diagnosis is usually based on the telltale lesions, because the body quickly metabolizes the drug's psychoactive agent, desomorphine.

The drug was dubbed 'krokodil' in Russia because of greenish, scaly skin lesions addicts develop, giving them the appearance of having crocodile skin.

A home-brewed heroin substitute popular in Russia, Krokodil is often concocted by cooking the prescription painkiller codeine along with gasoline, iodine, phosphorus, and other chemicals.

[Desomorphine is an opioid analog with a chemical structure similar to morphine. The structural differences produce a more rapid onset and shorter duration of action than morphine.

Clandestine manufacture of desomorphine involves 2 steps: the extraction of codeine from pharmaceutical products, followed by the synthesis of desomorphine from the codeine. The extraction of codeine involves mixing the codeine source (which often contains acetaminophen and other substances) with organic solvents such as gasoline, adding a strong base such as lye, and then adding an acidic solution such as hydrochloric acid to produce water soluble codeine salts that will reside in the aqueous layer. The codeine can be further extracted but many will proceed directly with the next step. The extracted codeine is mixed with iodine, hydrochloric acid, and red phosphorus to reduce the codeine to desocodeine. Subsequently the desocodeine is demethylated into desomorphine in a one-pot synthesis that may take 45 minutes. There are some reports of attempts at neutralization at the end of the reaction using cigarette ash or sodium bicarbonate. Despite these efforts the solution is often quite acidic with a pH less than 3 [1]. Analysis of Russian samples shows that what is purported to be desomorphine is often a sloppy mixture of 4 synthetic analogues of desomorphine, codeine, and other chemicals resulting from poor synthesis procedures. The actual desomorphine content of krokodil samples ranged from traces to 75 percent [2].

Desomorphine has been shown to have a greater addictive potential than morphine [3]. The rapid onset of action produces an intense "rush" that is both pleasurable and drives many users to compulsively use and abuse the substance in a manner similar to heroin.

Repeated administration of any opiate can cause physical dependency, which requires increasing doses to produce the desired effect and a withdrawal syndrome if the substance is no longer taken.

Desomorphine, when produced in clandestine home labs is notoriously impure and contaminated with toxic substances. Injection can cause immediate damage and destruction of skin, blood vessels, muscles, and bone. Iodine used in the synthesis process can cause thyroid and muscle damage. Phosphorus, also a contaminant, is known to damage cartilage. The damaged tissue is susceptible to infection, which may lead to abscesses, inflammation, and destruction of the veins (thrombophlebitis), and death of the soft tissue. The constellation of related tissue damage has lead many media reports to refer to desomorphine as a "flesh eating" or "flesh rotting" drug [5,6]. Pure desomorphine itself is not known to cause these effects. Intravenous injection of street krokodil is also well known to cause life threatening blood stream infections, destruction of the heart valves, and death. Because desomorphine is short acting compared to morphine and heroin, the need for more frequent injection increases the risks of infection from hepatitis C virus and HIV [4].

As with most opioids, death can occur at high doses because of respiratory depression. Street desomorphine carries additional potentially fatal risks associated with injecting impure chemicals into the body.

This homemade concoction of fuel and narcotics literally eats the body from the inside out. The lesions appear to have no cure and are reported to be painful and devastating. The concoction is not pure and may not be homogenous, and in some cases those choosing to use the drug have injected straight fuel into the veins. Most people choosing to use this drug are dead inside of 2 years. The warning here is for people to know what they are doing and for parents to know about the lethal effects of this combination and to warn children, teens, and young adults.
