Testing for avian on chicken farm outside flu hot zone
-------------------------------------------------
Officials are checking out concerns that avian flu has been detected on a
chicken farm outside a hot zone where hundreds of thousands of poultry will
be slaughtered.
Chickens on the farm, which is located somewhere in the Fraser Valley,
showed signs leading federal health officials to conclude avian flu might
be present. The birds exhibited signs of a common illness called Newcastle
Disease [NCD], but also showed possible avian flu symptoms. [It seems that
the writer's perspectives have been influenced by the published severity of
avian influenza and its zoonotic potential. NCD is an OIE list A disease,
not recorded in Canada since 1973 and therefore not a "common" disease. -
Mod.AS].
"Analysis that CFIA has done indicated that the flock may have also been
infected with avian influenza," said Dr. Cornelius Kiley, a CFIA spokesman.
"We don't know that for sure."
The farm was placed under quarantine, the first outside a 5-km so-called
hot zone around an Abbotsford-area poultry farm where the virus was first
detected during February 2004.
Also on Mon, officials confirmed a 6th farm within the hot zone was
quarantined.
Kiley would not speculate on the implications that a farm outside the hot
zone farm could be infected.
"I think we're going to wait until we find out what the result is and what
the investigation means before we're going to comment further on it."
Health officials announced last week all poultry -- close to a million
birds -- within the hot zone would be slaughtered as a pre-emptive move to
kill the virus.
Kiley would not say whether further precautions would be imposed if it's
confirmed avian flu made its way to a farm outside that area.
He said the pre-emptive slaughter began over the weekend on a few
operations and was expected to be done within 10 days.
The 7th farm where avian flu is suspected is somewhere within a geographic
area referred to as a control zone that was imposed on parts of southern
British Columbia after the avian flu outbreak earlier in March 2004.
Control zone regulations restrict the movement of any bird in captivity,
including pets, day-old chicks, and hatching eggs.
Farmers must now apply for a permit to move the birds and any bird product
including eggs out of the area that stretches to the North Shore mountains,
west to the ocean, south to the U.S. border, and east to the town of Hope.
Premier Gordon Campbell said Mon that it could be necessary for the
provincial government to come up with some remedy to help the province's
poultry processors, who say they will be losing millions of dollars as a
result of the shipping ban.
