Beer KD, Farnon EC, Jain S, et al. Multidrug-resistant _Aspergillus fumigatus_ carrying mutations linked to environmental fungicide exposure -- three states, 2010-2017.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The environmental mold _Aspergillus fumigatus_ is the primary cause of invasive aspergillosis. In patients with high-risk conditions, including stem cell and organ transplant recipients, mortality exceeds 50%. Triazole antifungals have greatly improved survival (1); however, triazole-resistant _A. fumigatus_ infections are increasingly reported worldwide and are associated with increased treatment failure and mortality (2). Of particular concern are resistant _A. fumigatus_ isolates carrying either TR34/L98H or TR46/Y121F/T289A genetic resistance markers, which have been associated with environmental triazole fungicide use rather than previous patient exposure to antifungals (3,4). Reports of these triazole-resistant _A. fumigatus_ strains have become common in Europe (2,3), but USA reports are limited (5). Because of the risk posed to immunocompromised patients, understanding the prevalence of such isolates in patients is important to guide clinical and public health decision-making. In 2011, CDC initiated passive laboratory monitoring for U.S. triazole-resistant _A. fumigatus_ isolates through outreach to clinical laboratories. This system identified five TR34/L98H isolates collected from 2016 to 2017 (6), in addition to 2 other U.S. isolates collected in 2010 and 2014 and reported in 2015 (5). 4 of these 7 isolates were reported from Pennsylvania, 2 from Virginia, and 1 from California. 3 isolates were collected from patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, and 4 patients had no known previous triazole exposure. _A. fumigatus_ resistant to all triazole medications is emerging in the USA, and clinicians and public health personnel need to be aware that resistant infections are possible even in patients not previously exposed to these medications.

Triazole antifungal medications are the primary treatment for invasive _A. fumigatus_ infections, opportunistic infections that typically affect immunocompromised patients. Invasive aspergillosis is almost universally fatal without antifungal treatment. Clinical outcomes improved with the use of amphotericin B and have improved further with the introduction of mold-active triazole antifungals such as voriconazole, posaconazole, and itraconazole, which are also associated with fewer adverse events than is amphotericin B (7). Resistance to triazoles has been associated with treatment failure and increased mortality, but the prevalence of infection with resistant strains in USA hospitals is unknown (1,4). Structurally similar triazoles are used extensively as fungicides in agriculture and other environmental applications. _A. fumigatus_ is not typically a plant pathogen but is common in soil and decaying plant material. Incidental exposure of _A. fumigatus_ to fungicides during agricultural or other environmental applications can select for mutations conferring resistance to triazoles. _A. fumigatus_ spores are known to be carried long distances in the air, putting patients at risk for infection with resistant strains, even in areas without known agricultural fungicide usage.

In Europe, molecular epidemiologic studies have identified 2 resistant _A. fumigatus_ genotypes associated with environmental triazole exposure (4). These genotypes, TR34/L98H and TR46/Y121F/T289A, confer resistance to triazoles by altering the drug target, Cyp51A, which is involved in fungal cell wall synthesis. Importantly, TR34/L98H confers resistance to all mold-active medical triazoles without incurring a fitness cost or survival disadvantage to the fungus. _A. fumigatus_ strains of this genotype have been isolated from the environment (such as, compost, seeds, soil, commercial plant bulbs, and patient households) (8). Although these mutations have been detected repeatedly in environmental isolates, they have not been common among isolates from patients treated with long-term triazoles in whom resistance might have been expected to develop. Most (50%-75%) patients with TR34/L98H isolates have not been exposed to triazole therapy, further suggesting environmental acquisition of resistance (3).

Until 2015, no isolates with these genotypes had been reported in the USA; that year, a USA fungal reference laboratory reported detecting 2 TR34/L98H and 2 TR46/Y121F/T289A _A. fumigatus_ isolates among 220 clinical isolates collected from 2001 to 2014 (5). In 2017, TR34/L98H _A. fumigatus_ isolates were first detected in USA environmental samples obtained from a commercial peanut field treated with triazole fungicides (9). Together, these reports demonstrate that triazole-resistant _A. fumigatus_ strains have emerged in the USA in both patients and the environment, likely caused by selection for resistance during environmental triazole use.

In 2011, CDC issued a request for clinical _A. fumigatus_ isolates on the ClinMicroNet e-mail listserv of approximately 800 USA clinical microbiology laboratory directors, leading to a USA laboratory-based convenience sample of _A. fumigatus_ isolates (systematic public health surveillance for _A. fumigatus_ has not been conducted in the USA). In 2016, CDC received the 1st TR34/L98H isolate through this passive monitoring system, and an additional 4 have been identified to date among approximately 2300 total isolates received (6). Together, these 5 and the 2 previously reported isolates (5) represent the 1st 7 TR34/L98H isolates identified in the USA (Table -- available at the source URL above - Mod.LL). This report provides epidemiologic and clinical descriptions of the patients associated with these _A. fumigatus_ triazole-resistant isolates.

Clinical summaries
------------------
Pennsylvania, 2010. Following stem cell transplantation for sickle cell anemia, a woman developed graft-versus-host disease and respiratory failure. Resistant _A. fumigatus_ was isolated from sputum. Despite therapy with voriconazole and caspofungin, her respiratory status worsened, and therapy was switched to amphotericin B and caspofungin. She deteriorated further and died of multisystem organ failure 6 months after isolate collection.

Pennsylvania, 2014. A man with _A. fumigatus_ colonization following lung transplantation initially was treated with long-term voriconazole followed by itraconazole. He was hospitalized with bacterial and viral pneumonia, developed clinical invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, and was treated with itraconazole and caspofungin, followed by posaconazole and caspofungin, then inhaled amphotericin B. Resistant _A. fumigatus_ was isolated from a bronchoalveolar lavage. With worsening clinical status and persistently positive _A. fumigatus_ cultures, therapy was switched to liposomal amphotericin B and caspofungin; however, bronchoscopy indicated ongoing fungal infection. He died from multisystem organ failure approximately 2 months after isolate collection.

Pennsylvania, 2016. A woman with sarcoidosis and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis was treated with low-dose voriconazole because of vision-associated side effects at higher doses. Respiratory symptoms had worsened at the time of sputum collection, and when the resistant _A. fumigatus_ isolate was identified, therapy was changed to caspofungin for 12 months. Following therapy, the patient was clinically stable with no radiographic evidence of progression to chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis or aspergilloma.

Pennsylvania, 2017. A resistant _A. fumigatus_ isolate was collected by bronchoalveolar lavage from a woman with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis, while she was hospitalized for hydropneumothorax and bacterial pneumonia secondary to trauma; no antifungal treatment was given. The patient died of complications of her hydropneumothorax thought to be unrelated to _A. fumigatus_.

Virginia, 2016, case 1. A man who visited Virginia from Guatemala was hospitalized for acute bronchitis 3 weeks after his arrival. Resistant _A. fumigatus_ was isolated from sputum during this hospitalization. No antifungals were administered, and the patient was discharged to primary care.

Virginia, 2016, case 2. A woman with cystic fibrosis had resistant _A. fumigatus_ isolated from sputum at an outpatient visit 2 days before hospital admission for a cystic fibrosis exacerbation. While hospitalized, she received steroids and antibacterials but not antifungals. She was later discharged with oral antibacterials.

California, 2017. A woman with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring inhaled corticosteroids, chronic heart failure, and chronic kidney disease was evaluated as an outpatient for a productive cough. Sputum cultures grew _A. fumigatus_, and IgG antibody to _A. fumigatus_ was twice the normal value. She was not started on antibacterials or antifungals.

Discussion
----------
_A. fumigatus_ strains with mutations conferring resistance to mold-active triazole agents have been found in clinical and environmental specimens in the USA. In total, 10 USA clinical isolates with these genotypes (7 TR34/L98H and 3 TR46/Y121F/T289A) have been reported (5,10). Together, these reports likely underrepresent the number of USA isolates because aspergillosis and _A. fumigatus_ colonization are not reportable in any state and few laboratories perform susceptibility testing for _Aspergillus_ species. 4 of the 7 patients with TR34/L98H were not treated with antifungal therapy following culture; these 4 isolates, all from sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage, likely reflected _A. fumigatus_ colonization rather than infection. However, the presence of highly resistant _A. fumigatus_ strains in patient isolates suggests that USA clinicians need to be aware of the risk for triazole-resistant aspergillosis. Notably, 4 patients had no known exposure to antifungal medications before culture of the resistant isolate, supporting possible environmentally acquired resistance.

The 5 isolates identified at CDC during 2016-2017 were collected from patients who did not share health care facilities, procedures, or county of residence, arguing against shared health care acquisition. Given that _A. fumigatus_ can undergo selection for antifungal resistance during triazole fungicide exposure in the environment, and spores of resistant strains might be transmitted through the air and inhaled, further exploration of triazole fungicide use and presence of triazole-resistant _A. fumigatus_ in these areas is warranted.

The findings in this report are subject to at least 2 limitations. First, among the 7 _A. fumigatus_ isolates with the TR34/L98H mutations identified in the USA to date, 4 were collected in Pennsylvania, 2 in Virginia, and 1 in California. These 3 states contributed only 28% of all CDC _A. fumigatus_ isolates collected during 2015-2017, raising the possibility of geographic localization. Second, because isolates were collected through passive monitoring and not systematic surveillance, caution must be exercised when interpreting these findings.

With environmentally derived TR34/L98H triazole-resistant _A. fumigatus_ detected in the USA, systematic surveillance, detailed geographic data, and data on triazole fungicide use could be important for assessing the scope of the problem and trends in resistance. Exploration of risk factors for patient acquisition might provide opportunities to prevent exposure and mitigate risk for invasive infection in susceptible populations. Clinicians and microbiologists need to be aware of the possibility of triazole-resistant _A. fumigatus_ infections, even in triazole-naïve patients. Expanded capacity to test for antifungal susceptibility in _A. fumigatus_ could help inform clinical and public health decisions.

[The limitations of the study as stated aside, the recognition of triazole resistant _A. fumigatus_ is worrisome and strikes hard into the therapeutic approach in immunosuppressed individuals. The availability of antifungal sensitivities of _Aspergillus_ isolates is quite limited so empiric and early change in antifungal treatment of invasive aspergillosis away from these useful groups of antifungals may need to occur. - Mod.LL
