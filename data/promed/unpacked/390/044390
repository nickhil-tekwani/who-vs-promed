The San Francisco Health Department is warning IV [intra-venous
drug users they could fall victim to flesh-eating bacteria. In the past
two weeks, 3 people have been diagnosed with the disease...and
one of them has died. Two of the patients had injected black tar
heroin and shared needles. The third injected meth
[methamphetamines or speed.

[The so-called "flesh-eating" bacteria are generally strains of beta
hemolytic _Streptococcus_ of Group A that have virulence factors that
facilitate rapidly progressive subcutaneous infections. The incidence
associated with non-hygienic puncture wounds is relatively low, but the
practice of needle sharing could easily produce a cluster of cases. As is
well known to IV drug users in general, and certainly in San Francisco,
there are so many other good reasons for not sharing needles, that I'm a
bit surprised to be talking about it. - Mod.ES
