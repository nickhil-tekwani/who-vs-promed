[Lumpy skin disease outbreaks tend to be haphazard, depending upon animal movements, immune status, and wind and rainfall patterns affecting vector populations. For example the recurrence of outbreaks in Israel after an absence of 17 years could be attributed to a combination of these factors. LSD must be considered to have the potential to become established outside Africa. The principal method of transmission is mechanical by arthropod vector.

For additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2013, Chapter 2.4. 14 "Lumpy Skin Disease" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.14_LSD.pdf(adopted by the OIE World Assembly of Delegates, May 2010).

OIE's internationally agreed requirements pertaining to lumpy skin disease are described in Chapter 11.12 of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code, available at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.11.12.htm

Information obtained from OIE's WAHID database indicates that during 2013, 234 outbreaks occurred in the area: Lebanon (1), Jordan (2), Palestinian Autonomous Territories (58), Israel (172), Turkey (1) -- the most recent case. The total number of animals affected with these 234 outbreaks is: 35 441 susceptible, 1996 cases, 247 dead, and 198 destroyed.

This information and additional data on these events can also be found in the WAHID database at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Diseasetimeseries

This last LSD case in Turkey confirms the recently published ProMED-mail request for information on a suspect case in that area (archive no 20130831.1915595). The outbreak, now officially reported to the OIE, is the 1st case of LSD occurring in Turkey, in the province of Kahramanmaras (Lat 38.263726 Lon 37.202196. http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_imm_0000014106_20130917_121547.pdf). - Mod.CRD]

[There are concerns about LSD spreading in Turkey (and other Middle Eastern countries) during the period approaching Eid el Adha ("Feast of the Sacrifice"), due this year on 14-15 Oct. This event, which is celebrated throughout the Muslim world, is preceded by a significant increase of trade and movement of animals for slaughter. - Mod.AS
