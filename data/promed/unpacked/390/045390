White-nose syndrome found in bats at Delaware forts
-------------------
A fungal disease that has decimated bat populations from Canada to the Deep South has been found in Delaware.

White-nose syndrome is a fungus that has killed between 5 and a half and 6.7 million bats in Canada, the Northeast, Midwest and South since it was 1st discovered in 2006. Biologists from DNREC [Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control] have diagnosed the disease in bats hibernating in Fort DuPont and especially Fort Delaware in Delaware City. While there's no known threat to humans, DNREC will be educating visitors to Fort Delaware this spring about how to prevent the spread of white-nose syndrome to different bat species.

While the bat population in Delaware isn't as large as in some other states, DNREC says a significant loss in Delaware's bat population could impact humans, because bats eat large numbers of flying insects, including major agricultural pests. A DNREC study has estimated that bats save farmers billions in pesticide costs.

[There was a report of WNS in bats in Delaware in 2010. While an update is always appreciated, this one only serves to remind us the disease is still there.

Bat disease found nearby

The 1st cases of white-nose syndrome have been detected in Alabama bats. White-nose syndrome has killed more than 5.5 million bats since it was discovered in a New York cave in February 2006. The fungus only lives within a narrow temperature range, and scientists believed Alabama was too far south for bats to be affected.

However, a survey by the National Park Service and Alabama A&M [Agricultural and Mechanical University] scientists was conducted at Russell Cave National Monument, and bats appeared to have telltale white patches that indicate white-nose syndrome. Scientists believe WNS causes bats to use up their fat reserves too quickly to stay in hibernation through winter.

"The park has taken steps to help prevent the spread of this disease that is so devastating to bat populations throughout the East," said Little River Canyon National Preserve Superintendent John Bundy. "Although the cave has been closed for more than 10 years, I am pleased to report that the archeological site remains open at this time, and visitors should not be impacted in any way."

The fungus is believed to be spread from bat-to-bat by contact or through human activity in cave systems. Whether white-nose syndrome is present in DeKalb County bats is unknown.

"We just don't know," said Littler River Canyon National Preserve Park Ranger Larry Beane. "We don't have any major cave systems in the preserve, so we haven't checked. We've found endangered gray bats feeding in the preserve, but we don't know where they're staying. We don't know of any place we can check bats for it."

The fungus spread from New York and has been detected in Canada and as far west as Oklahoma and south to North Carolina. The survey at Russell Cave was the 1st detected instance of white-nose syndrome in Alabama. There is no know cure, and the disease does not appear to affect humans or other animals.

Bats typically live for about 20 years, but some have been documented to live more than 40 years. However, they reproduce slowly and females produce only one pup each year. Bats shelter and hibernate in cool, dark places, which is the same environment the fungus thrives. Scientists have been reluctant to use fungicide treatments for fear of upsetting the balance of cave ecosystems.

Bats also play a critical role in controlling insect populations. They eat their body weight each night in the form of insects. In an hour, a brown bat can consume as many as 600 mosquitoes or more.

To prevent the spread of white-nose syndrome, the National Park Service recommends strictly adhering to local, state and federal cave advisories and closures. The NPS also warns not to pick up dead or sick bats, instead report them to a park ranger.

[This notice seems to reinforce the variety of bats that are affected by this fungus and that the fungus is increasing its range.
