N.J. Horses Quarantined after Equine Herpesvirus Exposure
--------------------------------------------------
The New Jersey Department of Agriculture announced the quarantine of 2 farms in the state on 22 Feb 2013 after horses at each farm were exposed to a horse that developed the highly infectious equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM).

The farms are located in Franklinville, Gloucester County, and Dennisville, Cape May County. Testing confirmed the horse developed EHM caused by equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1). The horse became recumbent and was humanely euthanized on 15 Feb 2013.

This is the 2nd case of EHM in New Jersey this year. A horse farm in Morris and another in Somerset County were quarantined in January [2013] when 1 horse tested positive for the disease. The sick horse has since recovered and the quarantines have been lifted. No apparent relationship between the 2 cases is evident.

"In these cases, the department immediately took the appropriate preventive measures to contain the virus and stop it from spreading," said New Jersey Secretary of Agriculture Douglas H. Fisher. "This swift action helps to prevent many more horses from becoming sick."

The EHV-1 virus spreads quickly from horse to horse, has a high morbidity and can cause a wide range of signs, from a complete lack of clinical signs to respiratory problems, especially in young horses, and spontaneous abortions in pregnant mares. The neurologic form of EHV-1, additionally, can cause an acute paralytic syndrome, which results in a high mortality. The incubation period of EHV-1 is typically 2 to 10 days. The virus spreads readily through direct contact with infected materials. While highly infectious, the virus does not persist in the environment and is neutralized by hand soap, alcohol-based hand sanitizers and sunlight. The virus does not affect humans and other domestic animals, with the exception of llamas and alpacas.

Concerned owners should consult with their veterinarian prior to taking any action as the clinical signs of infection with the neurological form of EHV-1 (EHM) are common to many other diseases. EHM is a reportable disease in New Jersey. If an owner has a horse that is exhibiting neurologic signs or suspects equine herpesvirus, they are directed to call their veterinarian immediately.

Horse tests positive for EHV-1 at Ocala, Florida, horse show
--------------------------------------------------
The case remains isolated, but has many owners of horses at the large competition on edge.

A horse at the Horse Shows in the Sun circuit in Ocala, Florida, was shipped to the University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine in Gainesville on 20 Feb 2013 with signs of equine herpesvirus. The horse tested positive for the neurological form of EHV-1.

As of this writing, shows are continuing as usual and the tent (Tent 7) in which the affected horse was stabled has been quarantined. Vets are monitoring horses on the grounds. No restrictions have been placed on horses moving on or off the Ocala show grounds. However, the Winter Equestrian Festival in West Palm Beach, approximately 250 miles south of Ocala, has released a statement stating that they have increased biosecurity measures and no horses from Ocala would be allowed on the grounds at this time.

HITS (Horseshows in the Sun) posted the following on its Facebook page around noon on 22 Feb 2013: "A horse was shipped to UF Gainesville last night with EHV symptoms. The signs were confirmed and the horse is stable. The tent where the horse was stabled has been quarantined and all horses are being monitored closely. Any signs of fever will be treated by vets immediately. No restrictions on horse movement on or off the show grounds have been declared at this time."

[An update on the horse being treated in Florida indicates it is responding to treatment and no horses have died from the Ocala show. Tent number 7 is under quarantine and if there are no further clinical signs of the disease in the horses in quarantine, the quarantine will be lifted in about 10 days. Temperatures of horses at the show should be monitored at least daily and any changes should be reported to a veterinarian immediately.

The disease is often abbreviated as EHV for equine herpesvirus or EHM for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy.

Equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) infection in horses can cause respiratory and neurological disease, abortion in mares, and neonatal foal death. The neurological form of the disease is known as equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM) and has the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality.

EHV-1 is easily spread and typically has an incubation period between 2-10 days. Respiratory shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10 days but may persist longer in infected horses. For this reason, the isolation period recommendation for confirmed positive EHM cases is 21 days. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include nasal discharge, incoordination, hindquarter weakness, recumbency, lethargy, urine dribbling, and diminished tail tone. The prognosis for EHM positive horses depends on the severity of signs and the period of recumbency. Employing supportive treatment with intravenous fluids, anti-inflammatory drugs, antiviral drugs, and other supportive measures may be beneficial, since there is no specific treatment for EHM.

Currently, no EHV-1 equine vaccine has a label claim for protection against the neurological strain of the virus.

This is a disease that has a profound effect on horses and owners. Horses have a very tough time recovering from this disease and owners have a difficult time treating or euthanizing their pets/companions.

This disease is not to be toyed with. Owners should heed the words of the veterinarians. Enforce the rest and isolation of your horse. Protect your horse and other horses as well.
