Government health officers have detected the 1st case of human
anthrax in Feni on Sunday [19 Sep 2010]. A 50-year-old resident of
Joynagar village under Mohamaya Union of Chagalnaia Upazila was found
to have anthrax during primary tests.

According to government officials, 583 cases [sic] have been detected
until Sunday [19 Sep 2010], with 63 new cases in the last 3 days.

Family members said the woman fell ill after eating beef that her son
had purchased from the local Chandgazi Bazar on 24 Aug 2010. A
boil-like skin lesion appeared on her right thigh. She was treated by
a village doctor and later in a private clinic. Upazila health and
family planning officer Mohammed Khairul Islam and Upazila livestock
officer Nurul Afsar went to the house on Sunday [19 Sep 2010] noon
after learning about the case and confirmed that she had contracted anthrax.

Khairul Islam said that enquiries were underway to ascertain whether
there were any more anthrax patients in the area.

On the previous day, beef traders in Chittagong claimed that their
trading had quartered due to the scare.

Government health officers have detected the 1st case of human
anthrax in Chuadanga. One man, 35, was identified to be infected with
anthrax at Mahmujumma village of the Sadar Upazila on Monday [20 Sep 2010].

Chuadanga Sadar Upazila medical officer Dr Wajed Ashraf Delwar told
bdnews24.com that they were informed of villagers' suspicion about a
father, 30, his wife, 26, and their son, 6, of Boalia village and of
the 35-year-old man of Mahmujumma village of being infected with
anthrax. On such information, a medical team along with district
civil surgeon Dr Lokman Hakim and livestock officer DD Ajoy Roy
visited the spot.

Ajoy Roy told bdnews24.com that they found the 35-year-old man to be
infected. After conducting tests, they said the wife and son had
gotten scabies.

"However, we could not check [the 30-year-old father], as he is
currently in Dhaka. The 35-year-old man left Dhaka after eating beef
at a relative's house. He started showing signs of the disease after
he reached home," the livestock officer added.
