From Monday (10 Dec [2007]) till Saturday (15 Dec [2007])
approximately 997 residents of the Jepara Regency, Central Java, were
attacked by chikungunya [virus]. The estimated number of patients was
still increasing, worrying the community.

The Health Service of the Jepara Regency determined that this
condition was an emergency. Nevertheless, the Section Head Health
Service of the Jepara Regency, Agus Salim, who was contacted on
Saturday afternoon [15 Dec 2007], asked the community to not panic
because chikungunya not was classified as a deadly illness.

Although the illness that resulted from virus [transmission] by
_Aedes albopictus_ could cause paralysis for 3-5 days, within 10 days
it would be resolved automatically. [Presumably, the "paralysis"
reported here is a reluctance of acutely infected patients to move
due to severe arthralgia, a common symptom of chikungunya virus
infection. - Mod.TY]

He added, not only is chikungunya present, currently in the spotlight
in Jepara, but also dengue fever is occurring there. Since January
[2007] until last Monday (10 Dec [2007]) there were more than 2000
dengue fever cases in Jepara.

With the emergency status due to chikungunya, as well as the number
of dengue fever sufferers, Jepara Regent Hendro Martojo instructed
the community, through the Forum for the Health of the Village, the
sub-district head, as well as the Community Health Centre, to further
increase eradication efforts of the mosquitoes breeding sites in
their respective environments.

[Apparently there are concurrent dengue and chikungunya epidemics
occurring in this part of Java. It is not clear if these 2 viral
infections are being differentiated by laboratory tests or only on
clinical grounds. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving further
information about laboratory confirmation of the viruses responsible
for these outbreaks, including the dengue virus type (or types)
involved.

The article mentions only _Aedes albopictus_ as the mosquito vector
of chikungunya, with no mention of _Ae. aegypti_, which is very
likely present as well. Control of the 2 diseases would be the same
-- mosquito vector control through the elimination of breeding sites.
Both mosquito species can transmit chikungunya virus and the 4 dengue
virus types.
