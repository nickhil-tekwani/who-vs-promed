The following background information on leptospirosis in Australia was
extracted from the GIDEON software program:
Most cases are reported from New South Wales and South Australia; evidence
of acute infection is present in 1% of patients from New South Wales. The
male/female ratio for reported cases is 10.4/1.0 (1996).
710 cases were reported for Queensland during 1985 to 1995, most during
February to July. The Peninsula region accounts for 35% of cases. Infection
is also common in the Central West region. 32% of isolates were serovar
hardjo and 23% were serovar zanoni.
Year Cases
1990 121
1991 169 (75 from Victoria; 53 from NSW)
1992 159
1993 178
1994 123 (59 from Queensland)
1995 148
1996 227 (109 from Queensland)
1997 126 (56 from Queensland)

The most common serovar is hardjo. Both serovar hardjo and serovar pomona
predominate among cattle.
