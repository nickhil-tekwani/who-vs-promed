About one out of every 6 herds of cattle in Devon has been hit by an
outbreak of bovine tuberculosis (TB), suggesting the disease is in danger
of running out of control in the county, figures have revealed.
The statistics came on a day when Government veterinary experts admitted
there was still not enough scientific evidence to opt for a clear
strategy. Instead, they launched a consultation document on how to proceed.
The apparent lack of direction more than 5 years into the Krebs culling
trials of badgers, which are seen as the main carrier of the disease,
dismayed farmers and other critics.
Updated figures from the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
(DEFRA) revealed that 907 herds out of 5737 in Devon were put under TB
restrictions in 2003. The figure equates to 15.8 percent of herds, and
Devon had the highest number of outbreaks in the country.
The county experienced 537 new outbreaks in 2003, suggesting the epidemic
is not being brought under control.
