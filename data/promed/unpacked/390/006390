Vietnam: Outbreak of Japanese Encephalitis in Unvaccinated Children
--------------------------------------------------
The number of children suffering from Japanese encephalitis in Vietnam's
central Da Nang city and Quang Nam province is increasing at an alarming
rate, according to the local newspaper "Young People" on Wed 6 Aug 2003.
The Da Nang Hospital received as many as 14 encephalitis suffers in July
2003, whereas it treated no more than 20 such patients in the first 6
months of 2003. 4 children have died of the disease.
Most of patients are children under 10 years old who have not undergone
vaccination. Japanese encephalitis is most common in the North of Vietnam,
so residents in the central region, especially rural and poor ones, pay
little attention to vaccination, said doctor Huynh Thi Phuong from the Da
Nang Hospital. Parents in Da Nang and Quang Nam are encouraged to take
their children between the ages of 1 and 15 years to health establishments
for vaccination. Between April and June 2003, over 700 children nationwide,
mainly in the northern region, suffered from Japanese encephalitis.
