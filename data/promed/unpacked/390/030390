Mumbai, July 29 [2000: Even as the death toll due to a mysterious disease
further mounted to 20, the influx of more patients into government
facilities began.
While Kalyan and Vasai talukas have had a maximum of 7 deaths each, Nala
Sopara has had 3 deaths, Ulhasnagar and Ambernath 2 each while there has
been one death reported from Thane according to district collector Mukesh
Khullar. He said that at least 30 patients had been admitted in various
facilities with similar symptoms throughout the district. The death in
Thane ­ male aged 22 -- was a Bhiwandi resident admitted to Chattraptai
Shivaji hospital here where he breathed his last late last night.
In Kalyan Dombivili Municipal Corporation (KDMC)'s Rukminibai hospital
alone 20 patients have been admitted after they complained of fever, nausea
and body pain. "Until and unless the actual disease is definitely
established we don't want to take chances since the situation is quite
volatile.
The teams from National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune and the
Directorate of Health Services (DHS) which descended on the KDMC were
taking samples, observations and interviews of people from areas which are
most affected. While the NIV team said it will need more time to make
comment, DHS joint directors Dr P B Khedekar and Dr Subhash Dodwad were of
the opinion that the possibilities were narrowing down to hemorrhagic
dengue or leptospirosis.
"Since both diseases are similar in nature we are following a similar line
of supportive symptomatic treatment in all these cases," pointed out Dr
Khedekar who added, "the postmortem reports of the deceased also show that
the lungs were affected which can happen in both dengue as well as
leptospirosis." He admitted that it was baffling to note that the quick
deterioration of patients, some of whom have died within 8-10 hours of
first complaint of discomfort. "Though not entirely unheard of in extreme
case [cases of leptospirosis it is very rare," he pointed out. Another
piece which doesn't fit the jig-saw is that the sample of mosquitoes
collected from the affected areas found only _Culex_ mosquitoes. While the
_Aedes_ species is known to cause dengue the _Culex_ is known only to cause
filariasis or elephantiasis.
State family welfare secretary Dr Sudhir Srivastava who was in Thane hasn't
ruled out the possibility of the disease being a mutant [sic variation of
the falciparum malaria. "This line of the inquiry should not be abandoned,"
he pointed out. Meanwhile all the 20 patients suffering from these symptoms
have been isolated in a separate ward in the Rukminibai where they are
being closely monitored. Two, aged 35 & 30, are reportedly critical. Eknath
Gaikwad, minister of state for health visited the patients at Rukminibai
hospital today while health minister Digvijay Khanvilkar is expected to
come calling tomorrow.

[This report shows a serious lack of basic laboratory diagnostic capability
close to one of India´s greatest cities, Mumbai. Rapid tests for malaria
(thick & thin blood film) & leptospirosis (microagglutination) should be
immediately available everywhere in the country. It is to be hoped that the
health minister on his visit brings with him a microscope, some slides,
appropriate stains & lancets so that blood smears can be taken from the
patients to diagnose malaria. ­ Mod.JW
