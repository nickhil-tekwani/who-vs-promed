At least 7 people are sick in New Zealand after eating a certain brand of oysters. Paroa Bay Oysters Limited recalled specific batches of raw fresh oysters because of the suspicion that they caused several cases of foodborne illness in Northland and Auckland.

Paroa Bay brand raw oysters in a 200-milliliter plastic tub and other oysters purchased from Paroa Bay Oysters factory shop from 30 Jul 2021 to 5 Aug 2021 have been recalled. Products have a use-by date up to and including 15 Aug 2021. They were sold at Countdown supermarkets throughout the North Island, Ocean Seafoods in Opotiki and at Paroa Bay Factory Shop in Kawakawa, Bay of Islands.

Five people notified Nga Tai Ora Public Health that they developed gastroenteritis-like symptoms including vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain within 48 hours of eating raw oysters from the same supplier. The agent responsible has yet to be confirmed. The 1st person to develop symptoms became ill on 1 Aug 2021 and the most recent on 5 Aug 2021. Two people from Auckland fell sick on 2 Aug 2021. There was a link to raw oyster consumption from a single supplier for all the reported cases.

Public health staff take a detailed food history for each affected person and review other reported cases of similar illnesses looking for common links. Where possible, people are tested for the organism that may have caused their illness, and any leftover food is sent for testing.

Jenny Bishop, New Zealand Food Safety national manager food compliance services, said anyone who has purchased the affected oysters should not consume them and return products to the retailer for a refund or throw them out.

"See your doctor if you or a family member has had vomiting or diarrhea for longer than 3 days. Take care when handling, preparing and consuming shellfish. If you have low immunity, or are immune-compromised, you should not eat raw or undercooked shellfish," she said.

[Norovirus illness could be considered here as well as bacterial infections due to _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ and other vibrioses.

Diarrheal shellfish poisoning (DSP) is noteworthy and not often discussed but is less of a possibility because of the short incubation period of the illness as apparently compared to here. DSP "is a gastrointestinal illness caused by the consumption of shellfish contaminated with algal toxins produced by marine dinoflagellates belonging to the genera _Dinophysis_ spp. (_D. fortii_, _D. mitra_, _D. rotundata_, _D. tripos_, _D. acuta_, _D. norvegica_, and _D. acuminata_) and _Prorocentrum_ spp. (_P. lima_, _P. maculosum_, _P. concavum_, and _P. hoffmannianum_). The DSP toxins, including okadaic acid (OA) and its analogues dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX-1), dinophysistoxin-2 (DTX-2), and dinophysistoxin-3 (DTX-3), belong to the larger group of lipophilic toxins that also includes the azaspiracid, yessotoxin, and pectenotoxin group toxins" (https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/ese.16.46.20020-en).

The term "diarrhetic shellfish poisoning" is often used for the illness, but this moderator prefers to use "diarrheal shellfish poisoning" to avoid any confusion between the almost homophones of "diarrhetic" and "diuretic."

DSP is often mistaken for norovirus-like disease. It is treated with rehydration, and affected individuals usually recover in 1 to 2 days. DSP diarrhea is the most commonly reported symptom (92%), closely followed by nausea (80%) and vomiting (79%), with onset 30 minutes to 12 hours from ingestion. Cooking or freezing does not destroy the toxin. DSP is most commonly found in shellfish in Europe and Japan but can appear anywhere and bears consideration with the appropriate epidemiology. - Mod.LL
