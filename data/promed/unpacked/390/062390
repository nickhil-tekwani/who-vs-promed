African Horse Sickness in South Africa
--------------------------------------------------
Suspected in the surveillance zone
Emergency report
Information received on 25 Feb 2004 from Dr Emily Mmamakgaba
Mogajane, Chief Director, Agricultural Production, National
Department of Agriculture, Pretoria:
Date of the report: 25 Feb 2004.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, post-mortem and laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 21 Feb 2004.
Estimated date of primary infection: 14 Feb 2004.
Outbreaks:
Location
Western Cape Province, Elsenburg district (33 deg 50 min S - 18 deg
50 min E), within the 'surveillance zone' of the 'African horse
sickness controlled area'
No. of outbreaks 1
Affected population:
4 horses died on a farm in the Elsenburg district within a short
period between 21 and 22 Feb 2004, and a 5th one on the same farm is
sick. 2 weeks ago another horse died on the same farm with a
diagnosis of atypical 'annual ryegrass toxicity'. All of these were
local horses that had been kept permanently in the 'surveillance
zone' for African horse sickness (AHS) and had therefore not received
annual AHS vaccinations. The 'surveillance zone' acts as an early
warning system for the 'free zone,' and horses are therefore normally
not vaccinated against the disease, in accordance with the export
protocol negotiated with the European Commission.
Diagnosis:
Clinical signs and the post-mortem examinations conducted at the
Western Cape Provincial Veterinary Laboratory indicated a possible
diagnosis of AHS. Samples taken from 2 horses on the evening of 23
Feb 2004 were sent to Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute (OIE
Reference Laboratory for AHS). A preliminary capture ELISA(1) yielded
positive results for AHS and a repeat overnight capture ELISA test
confirmed the diagnosis.
PCR(2) typing and virus isolation tests have been set up in order to
type the virus.
Epidemiological details:
The Elsenburg Agricultural College is situated within the 'AHS
surveillance zone' of the Western Cape Province and is approximately
40 km from the 'AHS free zone', which is the only area in South
Africa from where horses are accepted for export to other countries.
To date, epidemiological investigations have not revealed any suspect
cases on any of the adjacent properties or other farms in the area.
There are no records of any legal movements of horses into this area
of the 'surveillance zone' nor are there any suspicions at this stage
of any illegal movements.
These findings are confusing because AHS is a vector-transmitted
disease that requires an infected horse as a source of virus for
midges that then spread the disease very rapidly to other horses,
irrespective of farm boundaries. The disease is not present in the
'AHS controlled area' and even in the rest of the country only a few
cases have occurred so far in 2004.
Control measures:
The required disease control measures have already been instituted:
- All horses on the affected and neighbouring farms are stabled
overnight (from 2 hours before sunset until 2 hours after sunrise)
while the midges are active, and they are treated with insecticides
twice daily.
- Officials of the Directorate of Veterinary Services in conjunction
with private veterinary practitioners will start vaccinating all
horses against AHS within a radius of 20 km surrounding the outbreak.
- No horses are allowed to be moved into or out of the affected area,
while owners of horses bordering the area at risk are have been
advised to restrict unnecessary movement of their animals out of the
area.
These measures will serve to limit the spread of the disease should
it prove to be AHS or another midge-borne infection.
(1) ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(2) PCR: polymerase chain reaction
