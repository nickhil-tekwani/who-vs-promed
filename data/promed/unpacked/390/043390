Asian soybean rust has been confirmed for the 1st time in 2006 in
North Carolina, in Columbus County on the border with South Carolina.
The find joins 2 more in Georgia and another in Louisiana since Tuesday.
This raises the number of states with rust this year to 8, in 54
counties and parishes. Last year at this time, there was rust in 58
counties in only 5 states: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and
South Carolina. The additional states with rust at this point in 2006
are Louisiana, North Carolina and Texas.
Georgia also reported rust in Cook County today and in Sumter County
on Tuesday, the same day Louisiana reported rust in commercial field
in Washington Parish.
According to the N.C. state commentary on <http://www.sbrusa.net>,
"Asiatic soybean rust was identified on soybean samples collected
from a mobile sentinel plot on 13 Sep 2006. A few pustules were found
on several leaves.
"The soybean leaves were collected from near Tabor City in Columbus
County. Columbus County borders on South Carolina and is about 50
miles from Myrtle Beach, S.C.
The report from Steve Koenning and Jim Dunphy said 91 percent of the
soybean crop in the state has set pods, "thus about 85 percent to 95
percent of the crop is no longer at risk.
"Soybean producers in the southern counties of North Carolina should
be alert for rust moving any closer. If rust gets within 100 miles,
and the soybeans do not yet have fairly good-sized seeds in the pods,
we suggest spraying with a strobilurin fungicide. Assuming that some
growers may not get into the field before mid-week after the rain,
consider a combination of a strobilurin and a triazole (Headline SBR,
Stratego, or Quilt) especially on late maturity (Group VII or VIII)
and/or late-planted soybean.
"Soybeans that have full-sized soybeans in the pods (stage R6) before
rust is identified in the field will probably mature before rust
causes significant yield loss, and it is illegal to spray any of our
fungicides that late in soybeans' development. As infrequently as
rust affects soybeans that have not started blooming, we also would
not spray soybeans that have not started blooming yet."
Georgia reports on <http://www.sbrusa.net> that "Soybean rust was
reported 9/13 in an industry research plot in Sparks in Cook County
Georgia. This is the first report of rust in that county this growing
season. Cook County is located in south central Georgia, south of
Tift County Georgia. Rust has already been confirmed in Tift County,
so this report in Cook County is no surprise."
On 12 Sep 2006, soybean rust was detected on a soybean sample
collected 18 Sep from one of the sentinel plots in Plains, GA (Sumter
County, located in west Georgia). Rust was detected with a dissecting
microscope on one leaflet of 100 collected, with fewer than 20 rust
pustules on the leaf. This is the first find of rust in that county
this growing season.
"With the recent rains and the numerous findings of rust in South
Carolina, it is extremely important that everyone continue to scout
their soybeans for possible rust and be prepared to spray if you have
not done so already," the report said. "If you are a soybean grower
in Georgia, please follow the management recommendations given by Dr.
Bob Kemerait given below:
"Spray guidance: It is likely that most of the commercial soybean
crop in Georgia is now in the R4 (full pod stage) and may be moving
to the R5 growth stage (early seed) where seeds are approximately 1/8
inch in length.
Theoretically, the soybean crop is at risk to Asian soybean rust
until it reaches R6 (full seed) growth stage. Here are our recommendations:
"1. For growers whose crop is from R2 (full flower) to R4 (full pod),
we recommend that a fungicide application is warranted for Asian
soybean rust in all but the extreme northwest corner of the state
(northwest Georgia should continue to monitor for rust). Growers
whose crop is between R2 and R4 should use a triazole fungicide (such
as Folicur, Domark, Laredo, Uppercut, etc.) or combination of
triazole/strobilurin (such as Headline SBR) if infection has likely
occurred in their field (e.g. SW Georgia and they have decent yield potential.
"Where it is unlikely that infection is established in a field, or
that infection is very low, growers can effectively use any of our
labeled products for control (strobilurins, triazoles, strobilurins &
triazoles). Use of chlorothalonil must be considered carefully at
this point. Our data suggests that chlorothalonil products do not
perform as well as other products where disease infection may have
already occurred.
"2. If the crop has reached the R5 growth stage in a field, the crop
is still technically at-risk to soybean rust. However, given the slow
spread of the disease until now, it seems unlikely that soybean rust
will severely affect this crop before it reaches R6 (full seed). For
growers who are concerned and wish maximum insurance, follow the
spray recommendations above. However, we do not have a general spray
recommendation for soybeans that have already reached the R5 stage
and where rust is not yet found."
Louisiana reported on 12 Sep on <http://www.sbrusa.net> that "Asian
soybean rust was found in Washington Parish in a commercial field of
soybeans. Although this sighting is the first for the parish, the
crop is in the late stages of development. No treatment is required."

[Asian soybean rust (ASR ) is a plant disease caused by the fungus
_Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ and was introduced into the USA in 2004. In
addition to the crop plant soybean (_Glycine max_), cowpeas, green
beans, and other edible legumes could be affected by the ASR pathogen
which causes defoliation and yield reduction. Kudzu (_Pueraria
lobata_, a.k.a. Japanese arrowroot) is an important alternate host
for the pathogen in southern states of the USA.
ASR is sufficiently widespread in the 8 states / 54 counties or
parishes where it has been reported in 2006 that most state extension
plant pathologists are recommending preventive spraying of fungicides
for soybeans that are not yet mature. ProMED-mail does not endorse
or recommend any of the specific fungicides mentioned in the report.
Most soybean crops in these states are beyond the stages singled out
for spray treatment, minimizing the overall impact of ASR in 2006
despite its now widespread distribution. Most reports indicate that
incidence/severity of ASR was low when found. It is noted in the
report that on this date (mid September) in 2005 Louisiana, North
Carolina and Texas had not yet reported ASR.
The posted report represents one of 30 similar reports that have been
filed on the <http://www.sbrusa.net> web site since the last
ProMED-mail update on 15 Aug 2006 (20060815.2288). These are
summarized below, by date (most recent 1st), state, county or parish,
nature of report, host plant and type of field/plot. Individual
reports mostly resemble the one above and can be found at
