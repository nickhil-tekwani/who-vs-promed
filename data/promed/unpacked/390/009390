1st 2022 Delaware Evidence of Eastern Equine Encephalitis Detected in DNREC's Sentinel Chickens
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE), a mosquito-transmitted disease, has been detected in Delaware the 1st time for 2022 in a sentinel chicken, the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) announced today [12 Aug 2022]. Mosquito-transmitted virus detections in DNREC's sentinel chickens are unrelated to Delaware's poultry industry.

The EEE finding in northern New Castle County was from a sentinel chicken station sampled by the DNREC Division of Fish and Wildlife Mosquito Control section and confirmed by the Delaware Public Health Laboratory on [9 Aug 2022]. While there have been no reported EEE cases in humans this year [2022] in the state, Delawareans are reminded the possibility of contracting mosquito-transmitted diseases, including EEE and West Nile Virus (WNV), will continue until colder autumn temperatures in late-October or later.

The 1st EEE-positive sentinel chicken for this year [2022] adds to 5 WNV-positive sentinel chickens found earlier at 3 other sentinel chicken arbovirus monitoring stations in New Castle and Kent counties -- with the 1st WNV finding occurring in early July [2022]. No EEE or WNV human cases have been reported to date in 2022 by the Delaware Public Health Laboratory, nor have any EEE or WNV equine cases been reported by the Delaware Department of Agriculture.

Blood samples are collected by the Mosquito Control section each week from early July into October from the state's outdoor-caged sentinel chickens, humanely housed and handled at 20 monitoring stations statewide. The blood samples are tested for EEE and WNV antibodies by the Delaware Public Health Laboratory. Sentinel chickens bitten by mosquitoes carrying EEE or WNV develop antibodies to these diseases but are otherwise unaffected. Mosquitoes can transmit both WNV and EEE to humans and horses.

The public is reminded to take common-sense precautions to avoid mosquito bites, including wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants when outdoors in mosquito-prone areas, applying insect repellent containing 10 to 30% diethyltoluamide (DEET) in accordance with label instructions and avoiding mosquito-infested areas and at times of peak mosquito activity around dusk, dawn and at night.

Spraying to reduce mosquito populations in areas where EEE or WNV is detected may be initiated by DNREC's Mosquito Control section as warranted, based on factors to include mosquito population levels and mosquito species present in affected areas. To reduce mosquito-breeding habitat and chances of disease transmission, residents should drain or remove outdoor items collecting water, such as discarded buckets or containers, uncovered trashcans, stagnant birdbaths, unprotected rain barrels or cisterns, old tires, upright wheelbarrows, flowerpot liners, depressions in boat tarps, clogged rain gutters, corrugated downspout extenders and unused swimming pools.

While EEE is rarer than WNV, both EEE and WNV can adversely affect people and horses. Most people who become infected with EEE virus and WNV show either no or mild symptoms. Early symptoms in people contracting EEE or WNV can be similar, but EEE often becomes more pronounced and debilitating, manifested by meningitis or encephalitis typically resulting in hospitalizations. EEE has a higher human mortality rate of approximately 30%, with infants, children and the elderly most vulnerable, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms in people infected with EEE usually start from 4 to 10 days after being bitten by a mosquito infected with EEE. Early EEE symptoms can include headache, high fever, stiff neck, tremors or muscle weakness, with more severe cases progressing to stupor, disorientation, coma, convulsions, paralysis and possibly death. Most people infected with WNV do not develop symptoms, but about 20% can develop a mild illness, including fever, body and muscle aches, headache, nausea, vomiting, and rash symptoms. A small number of people infected with WNV can develop serious illness involving neurological problems, paralysis and possibly death. There are no human vaccines for EEE or WNV. Anyone developing the symptoms described above should see their healthcare provider.

Horse owners should contact their veterinarian immediately if they suspect their horse may be showing signs of WNV or EEE. Signs of EEE in horses include fever (102.5-104.5Â°F; 39.2-40.3 deg C), loss of appetite, head pressing, depression or personality change, wobbling or staggering, weakness, blindness, convulsions, muscle tremors in the head and neck or hind-limb weakness. These signs are also consistent with WNV, although a fever may or may not be present with WNV. [There are vaccinations for horses to prevent these 2 diseases. Horse owners should see their veterinarian immediately to get their animals vaccinated as the virus is already circulating in the areas. - Mod.TG]

Eastern Equine Encephalitis reported in Antwerp, NY horse
---------------------------------------------------------
The Jefferson County Public Health Service has been notified by the New York State Department of Health that a 6-year-old, unvaccinated horse, who died in the Town of Antwerp, was positive for Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE, Triple E). Results are pending for another horse residing in the Town of Orleans who was exhibiting similar signs. The last lab-confirmed positive EEE cases in Jefferson County horses occurred in 2020.

Antwerp is located in upstate New York approximately 90 miles [145 km] north of Syracuse.

EEE is very rare but serious. Mosquitoes infected with EEE virus (EEEV) can infect people, horses and other mammals, some birds, reptiles and amphibians. About 5-10 EEE human cases are reported each year in the U.S. Five cases of EEE in people in New York State have been reported since 1971. These cases were reported in 1971, 1983, 2009, 2010 and 2011 and occurred in Oswego and Onondaga counties. All 5 cases died.

The risk of getting EEE is highest from late July through September. People at the greatest risk of developing severe disease are those over 50 years of age and younger than 15 years of age. There is no specific treatment available for EEE.

Horse dies of EEE virus in Oswego County, officials plan aerial spraying
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A horse in the town of Mexico died Tuesday [30 Aug 2022] of Eastern Equine Encephalitis, a mosquito-borne virus, Oswego County Health Department officials said.

The diagnosis was confirmed in test results released by the New York Health Department, officials said.

The horse was not vaccinated for EEE, according to a news release by the Oswego Health Department. Horses cannot spread the disease to people, but it can be transmitted by infected mosquitoes to humans and horses. There is no EEE vaccine available to humans.

Human cases of EEE are rare. About 1/3 of people who get EEE die from the disease and most survivors suffer brain damage.

The county is planning an aerial spraying, a partial measure to control the spread of the EEE virus, officials said. Details will be announced to the public when plans are finalized, officials said.

Health officials said people should use repellent, wear protective clothing outdoors and remove standing water from their yards which can serve as mosquito breeding grounds.

There have been 8 reported human EEE deaths in Onondaga and Oswego counties since 1971.

Central New York is a hot spot for EEE. Freshwater swamps such as the Cicero Swamp in Onondaga County and Toad Harbor in Oswego County are prime breeding grounds for mosquitoes carrying EEE. Infected mosquitoes can travel up to 5 miles.

MDARD Confirms Eastern Equine Encephalitis in St. Joseph County Horse
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Today [2 Sep 2022], the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) is reporting Michigan's 1st case of Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) for 2022 in a 3-year-old Standardbred filly from St. Joseph County. This discovery underscores the need for both horse owners and Michigan residents to take precautions.

EEE is a zoonotic, viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes to both animals and people; it is typically seen in late summer to early fall each year in Michigan. EEE is one of the most dangerous mosquito-borne diseases in the U.S. with a 90% fatality rate among horses becoming ill and a 33% fatality rate among humans who become ill. Last year [2021], Michigan experienced 9 cases of EEE in horses and one human case.

"The St. Joseph County horse was never vaccinated against EEE, and it developed signs of illness -- including fever and ataxia -- which progressed to the animal exhibiting neurologic signs and being down on the ground with an inability to get up. The horse later succumbed to the disease," said State Veterinarian Nora Wineland, DVM. "It is critically important for horse owners to reach out to their veterinarian to discuss how to best protect their animals from EEE and other mosquito-borne diseases."

To protect horses and other animals, owners are encouraged to take the following precautions:
â¢ Talk to a veterinarian about vaccinating horses against EEE and other mosquito-borne diseases.
â¢ Place livestock in a barn under fans (as mosquitoes are not strong flyers) during peak mosquito activity from dusk to dawn.
â¢ Use an insect repellant on animals approved for the species.
â¢ Eliminate standing water on the property -- i.e., fill in puddles, repair eaves, and change the water in buckets and bowls at least once a day.
â¢ Contact a veterinarian if a horse shows signs of the illness: mild fever and stumbling, which can progress to being down and struggling to stand.

People can also be infected with EEE from the bite of a mosquito carrying the virus. The disease is not spread by horse-to-horse or horse-to-human contact. In humans, signs of EEE include the sudden onset of fever, chills, and body and joint aches. The virus can also cause severe encephalitis, resulting in headaches, disorientation, tremors, seizures, and paralysis. Permanent brain damage, coma, and death may occur in some cases.

"This equine case indicates the EEE virus is here in Michigan and provides a warning residents could also become infected by a mosquito," said Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, Michigan Department of Health and Human Services chief medical executive. "Michigan residents are urged to take precautions and protect themselves from mosquito bites."

Michiganders can stay healthy by following steps to avoid mosquito bites:
â¢ Using EPA registered insect repellents with one of the following active ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus or para-menthane-diol, and 2-undecanone; follow the product label instructions and reapply as directed.
- Don't use repellent on children under 2 months of age. Instead, dress your child in clothing that covers arms and legs and cover crib, stroller and baby carrier with mosquito netting.
â¢ Wearing shoes and socks, light-colored long pants and long-sleeved shirts when outdoors.
â¢ Making sure doors and windows have tight-fitting screens. Repair or replace screens that have tears or other openings.
â¢ Using bed nets when sleeping outdoors or in conditions with no window screens.
â¢ Eliminating all sources of standing water which can support mosquito breeding around your home, including water in bird baths, abandoned swimming pools, wading pools, old tires and any other object holding water once a week.

Overall, EEE and other mosquito-borne illnesses will continue to pose a risk to both animals and humans until temperatures consistently fall below freezing.

[Mosquito season is here! Unvaccinated horses are at risk of this disease. It can be deadly. EEE immunity wanes fairly fast in the horse. Consequently, revaccination is necessary approximately every 3-4 months. Even if you have vaccinated your equine friend, it may be time to do it again to keep the animal fully protected from this disease.

The virus is spread by mosquitoes, but a hard killing frost will kill the mosquitoes.

Please check with your veterinarian regarding when you gave vaccination last, or if in doubt, please vaccinate. EEE is preventable with safe, proven vaccines. - Mod.TG
