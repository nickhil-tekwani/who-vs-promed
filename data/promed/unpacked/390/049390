Anthrax in Tanzania (see page 3 of the source URL)
----------------------------------------------------
Event description
On 11 Jan 2019, the Tanzanian Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children (MOHCDGEC) informed WHO of a suspected outbreak of anthrax in Momba District, Songwe Region, located in the western part of the country. The event was initially reported to the local health authorities on 3 Jan 2019 by a community leader in Nzoka ward. However, epidemiological investigation established that the outbreak started on 9 Dec 2018 when the index case, a 70-year-old woman from Nzoka village, developed illness and died later in the community.

On 10 Dec 2018, a 13-year old girl from the same village developed similar illness and subsequently died in the community. A cluster of similar cases eventually occurred between 24 Dec 2018 and 7 Jan 2019, 2 of whom died (one in the community and the other one on arrival at a health facility).

Most of the case-patients presented with swelling and ulceration on different parts of the body. Swab specimens of the skin lesions were obtained from 4 initial case-patients and analysed at the Vwawa Hospital (the referral hospital for Songwe Region). Of these, 2 specimens showed gram-positive bacilli on Gram staining, pointing to a probable diagnosis of anthrax. In addition, 7 blood specimens were obtained and shipped to the national laboratory for further analysis. Test results released on 17 Jan 2019 by the Tanzania Veterinary Laboratory Agency in Dar es Salaam indicated that 3 of the 7 specimens tested positive for _Bacillus anthracis_ by polymerase chain reaction.

As of 17 [Jan] 2019, a total of 81 human cases of cutaneous anthrax have been reported, including 4 deaths (case fatality ratio, 4.9%). There have been no new cases since 7 Jan 2019. The ages of the cases range from one to 75 years, with a median age of 25 years. Females are more affected, accounting for 54% of the reported cases. The majority of the cases are farmers and livestock keepers. The cases originated from 4 different settlements in Nzoka village, namely, Chipanda, Nzoka, Kanyimbo and Manyolo.

The outbreak of anthrax in humans was preceded by the deaths of 16 heads of cattle since November 2018, and the community reportedly consumed and/or handled the carcasses. The veterinary team collected one specimen from a dead cow on 11 Jan 2019, and the sample has been sent to Iringa Zonal Veterinary Laboratory; the result is pending.

Public health actions
A national rapid response team, including a One Health officer, has been deployed to Songwe since 9 Jan 2019 to provide technical support to the region. On 31 Dec 2018, the district authority held a meeting with the community in the affected village to discuss the outbreak and provided health education, especially on prevention and early referral of suspected cases to health facilities.

The regional authority supplied medication to the affected district and recommended the treatment of cases using antibiotics either at local dispensaries or at Songwe regional hospital. The authority has controlled movement of animals to and from Nzoka village, as well as slaughtering of animals at Nzoka, until further notice.

As of 11 Jan 2019, a total of 500 heads of cattle (of 100 000 targeted) in Nzoka were vaccinated. A total of 50 000 doses of vaccines were ordered, of which 25 000 vaccines have already been received.

Situation interpretation
Tanzania is experiencing an outbreak of cutaneous anthrax in Nzoka village, Momba District, Songwe Region, related to the consumption of meat from diseased and/or dead cows. Several challenges have presented during this outbreak, including the shortage of field officers to appropriately manage the event. This has led to a delay in collection of specimens for the confirmation of the diagnosis in both animals and humans. Despite initial limitations in the response, several measures have been undertaken to contain further propagation of the disease, and the situation appears to be stabilizing. Beyond this outbreak and in line with the One Health approach, emphasis should be laid on controlling zoonotic diseases in animals before they affect humans.

It is noteworthy that the One Health approach to emergency preparedness and response is not functioning well at district and lower levels. Additionally, there is a need to strengthen the surveillance system to detect, investigate and confirm disease outbreaks in a timely manner.

There is little one can add to this sound WHO report on the situation in Tanzania and organizational problems. Anthrax is most cost-effectively managed if the livestock at risk are vaccinated proactively because this prevents not just the financial losses involved with animal cases and deaths, but it prevents the loss of human lives and the costs of treatment and hospitalisation of the human cases, which are not cheap. Livestock can be replaced. Humans can't. - Mod.MHJ
