Re: Recent measles outbreak in Victoria
---------------------------------------
The Communicable Disease Prevention and Control Unit of the Victorian
Government Department of Health is continuing to investigate the
recent increase in imported cases of measles to Victoria [See: Measles
- Australia (Victoria) 20010216.0309]. As of Tue 1 Mar 2011, a total
of 16 confirmed cases had been notified to the department. There were
3 cases aged less than 12 months, 3 aged between 5 and 16 years, 6
aged from 20 to 37 years, and the remainder were aged 45 to 66 years.
13 cases were reported to be not vaccinated and 3 cases were of
unknown vaccination status.

Epidemiological investigations undertaken by the department and
genotyping by the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory
established the presence of at least 4 distinct genotype clusters. An
additional 5 cases are awaiting genotyping, of which 3 are suspected
to have been acquired overseas and 2 in Victoria, although no
epidemiological link between these 2 latter cases and other cases has
been established to date. The index case in each of the 4 distinct
genotype clusters (which includes 2 clusters of genotype D4, genotype
D8 and genotype D9) acquired their infection overseas (South Asia,
South East Asia, and the UK). Only one of the index cases so far has
resulted in further cases at this stage. This particular cluster has
seen 2nd and 3rd generations of cases. Situations in which
transmission has occurred include household contacts, health
facilities, and a supermarket. Most notable in this cluster are the 2
cases aged 60 and 66 years (who are siblings). These cases fall
outside of the defined 'population at risk' for measles (i.e., those
born during or after 1966 when the vaccination became available in
Australia). These 2 cases were found to have spent their childhood in
a relatively remote rural region of Victoria, and presumably had never
been exposed to the measles virus before now.

6 of the 9 "index cases" (including those not linked to further
cases) have been identified as unvaccinated (vaccination status for
the remaining 3 cases was unknown). High immunisation coverage in
Victoria -- 93 per cent for one dose by 2 years of age, and 91 per
cent for 2 doses by 5 years of age appears to have assisted in halting
further transmission from the other index cases.

The department has undertaken a number of measures to control the
spread of disease including follow up of contacts (who are then
recommended for measles vaccine or normal human immunoglobulin, where
indicated) and health alerts to general practitioners, hospital
emergency departments. The department issued a health alert to the
general public via the media on 17 Feb 2011 to remind travellers to
check their vaccination status before travelling.

UMass Boston professor may have measles
---------------------------------------
A University of Massachusetts (UMass) Boston professor is suspected
of having measles, the 5th confirmed or suspected case of the highly
contagious disease to be reported in the past 2 weeks, city health
authorities said tonight. The faculty member, who is in his 40s and
teaches about 45 students, informed university officials yesterday
that he had been diagnosed with a possible case of the respiratory
illness, heralded by a fever, cough, runny nose, and telltale rash.

The university and the Boston Public Health Commission are telling
students, faculty, and staff who might have had contact with the
professor and who have not been vaccinated or previously exposed to
the disease to remain close to home for the next 3 weeks. It can take
that long for doctors to be certain that someone is not carrying the
disease.

"Although we believe a limited number of people may have been
exposed, we encourage our entire campus community to take
precautions," UMass Boston administrators said in a statement. Measles
vaccine is being offered by the university's health services office
during regular hours in hopes of forestalling a possible outbreak.

There was no immediate evidence that the professor, who was not
identified because of patient confidentiality laws, had contact with a
worker at the French Consulate in the Back Bay who tested positive
last month for the disease. There's also no evidence that the
professor had traveled outside the United States recently, said Ann
Scales, chief spokeswoman for the Public Health Commission. "There's a
lot of measles going on in different parts of the world, and we're an
international city," Scales said.

The only confirmed case of measles so far involves the French
Consulate worker, who arrived in Boston in late January [2011]. 3
Boston-area adults were identified last week as having symptoms
consistent with measles. Laboratory tests are being performed on those
patients, as well as the UMass professor, to confirm that they have
the disease; measles symptoms can mimic those of other infectious
diseases.

Most people in the United States have little reason to worry about
catching measles. Younger Americans have been widely vaccinated
against the disease, and most older Americans have natural immunity
because they were exposed to the virus in an era when the disease
widely circulated. Immigrants and travelers from nations where
vaccination is less routine are considered at risk, as are people who
received vaccine in the 1960s that was less potent than later
formulations.

Disease trackers respond swiftly to potential outbreaks because
measles spreads with such speed and ease, threatening those who remain
vulnerable. Last week, Boston health authorities immunized 205 people
in the Back Bay office building where the French Consulate has
offices.

Clark County investigates second child measles case in a month
--------------------------------------------------------------
A 2nd case of measles within a month in Clark County, this one in a
school-age child, is under investigation by health officials [for
information on first child see: 'Measles - USA (02): (WA) alert
20110216.0512']. The child was exposed 2 weeks ago at a medical
facility visited by the 1st stricken child, a 7 month old returned
with his family from a trip to India, said Dr Alan Melnick, the county
health officer. The baby developed the telltale red measles rash while
flying for more than 20 hours to Portland International Airport on 13
Feb 2011. He may have been coughing and sneezing -- the primary way
the highly contagious disease is transmitted. The next day, the baby
was taken to 2 medical facilities in Vancouver: the Evergreen
Pediatric Clinic and the pharmacy or outpatient lab at the Southwest
Washington Medical Center, officials said.

The school-age child had not been vaccinated when exposed, Melnick
said. That child visited the 7-Eleven store at 5101 NE 112th Ave in
Vancouver between 4 and 8 pm on Sun 27 Feb 2011, while contagious.

Health officials urged people who might have been exposed and have
not been vaccinated to avoid going out in public for 7 to 21 days
following exposure. In this case, the period starts Sun 6 Mar 2011 and
runs to Sun 20 Mar 2011. They also should seek vaccinations, although
the vaccine is most effective within just 3 days of exposure. Pregnant
women or people with immune system issues can receive immune globulin
shots within 6 days of exposure, in this case, by 8 pm on Sat 5 Mar
2011.

re: "Measles Outbreak: Tens of Thousands Exposed?"
Part (1) of Measles Update 2011 (02) 20110301.0677
--------------------------------------------------
In order to avoid confusion, here is the flight itinerary of the
measles case in a New Mexico resident, most likely exposed to measles
while visiting in London. No secondary cases have been identified in
New Mexico to date.

Case departed London-Heathrow at around noon on 20 Feb 2011 on United
flight 0919, arriving at Washington Dulles on the afternoon of Sun 20
Feb 2011. The case then spent 2 days in Washington DC before departing
on Southwest flight 3423 from Baltimore-Washington International
Airport on a 6:50pm scheduled flight to Denver on 22 Feb 2011, where
the case exited the plane at around 9 pm. Flight 3423 continued on to
San Diego without the case, but most likely had passengers on board
who were potentially exposed. The case then took Southwest flight 2605
from Denver to Albuquerque. Flight 2605 left Denver around 10pm on 22
Feb 2011 and arrived in Albuquerque a little before midnight on 22 Feb
2011.

Case had illness onset on 18 Feb 2011 and rash onset on 20 Feb 2011,
so was contagious on all of these flights.

Public health officials from jurisdictions with passengers on these
flights are following up to check immune status, offer measles vaccine
or immunoglobulin, and conducting surveillance for possible secondary
cases.

[ProMED-mail thanks Paul Ettestad for providing this lucid
clarification of the itinerary of the measles-infected passenger en
route from London (UK) to Albuquerque (NM). As of Mon 7 Mar 2011 there
have been no secondary cases reported along the patient's route or at
her final destination. The incubation period for measles virus
infection is 10-12 days, with the characteristic rash appearing by 14
days after exposure. - Mod.CP]

Minneapolis baby treated for measles
------------------------------------
Minnesota state health officials say they're investigating a case of
measles that recently sent a Minneapolis infant to the hospital.
Authorities said they are notifying people who may have come in
contact with the child at Hennepin County Medical Center or at other
specific settings. But they said the case poses little risk to the
public because of the high rate of measles vaccination in Minnesota.
"The greatest risk is to those who may have been exposed to the child
and have not been vaccinated," the state Health Department said.

It's the 7th time in 5 years that Minnesota has had a reported case
of measles, a potentially deadly disease that can spread easily from
person to person, according to the department. The child, who was not
identified, is now recovering. "This case reminds us of the importance
of getting vaccinated for diseases, such as measles, which can be
prevented with vaccines," said Dr Ruth Lynfield, state
epidemiologist.

Officials said the infant, who was too young to have been vaccinated,
became ill in late February and was probably infectious from 22 Feb to
2 Mar 2011. They're unsure where the child may have been exposed,
because the family recently spent time in Chicago and Indiana before
moving to Minneapolis.

Typically, children get the measles vaccine when they're about 1 year
old and again between the ages of 4 and 6. Symptoms of measles include
fever, runny nose, cough, loss of appetite, watery eyes, and a rash
that typically begins at the hairline and moves to the face, neck and
body, according to the Health Department. The rash usually lasts 5 to
6 days. In general, the 1st symptom, fever, occurs 8 to 12 days after
exposure.

Measles was once nearly eradicated in both the United States and
Europe, but the disease resurfaced in England and Europe after
vaccination rates dropped, health officials said.

Measles scare at Gold Coast tourist spots
-----------------------------------------
Queensland health authorities are concerned a teenage boy who became
infected with measles might have spread it at 2 Gold Coast tourist
spots. The boy is the latest Queenslander to contract the highly
infectious virus. It's believed he caught it interstate. "Anyone who
was at White Water World on Tuesday or Coolangatta Airport on Sunday
[27 Feb 2011] afternoon who develops measles-like symptoms in the next
week or 2 should contact their GP for advice," Gold Coast public
health medical officer Dr Don Staines said in a statement.

Queensland Health would continue to actively investigate the case, he
said. Measles is one of the most infectious of all communicable
diseases and can be acquired in public places through tiny droplets
from coughing and sneezing. The virus can live for several hours in
the environment.

Outbreak of measles in Seville
------------------------------
The number of children affected by an outbreak of measles in Seville
has risen to 39. The Provincial Delegation of Health stated yesterday
that the foci of infection are located in the of South Range, Litany
and La Plata. According to the Epidemiological Surveillance Service:
"The outbreaks are linked to people who have not been vaccinated
according to the immunization schedule."

Health officials argue that the risk of contracting the disease in
vaccinated individuals is practically nil. However, one such case is
an 11 year old who has been admitted to the Virgen del Rocio Hospital
for follow-up, although his progress is good.

Given this situation it has been decided that all 6 month old
children in the affected neighborhoods will receive a single dose of
measles vaccine. The Ministry of Health has indicated that this
measure is "exceptional and of temporary duration in response to the
current situation."

Measles outbreak hits Adamawa
-----------------------------
Barely a month after Adamawa State recorded a deadly incident of
Lassa fever, the state Ministry of Health has again announced an
outbreak of severe measles in at least 16 out of the 21 local
government areas of the state. [Recently another outbreak of Lassa
fever, occurring in Ebonyi state, was reported in ProMED-mail, see:
'Lassa fever - Nigeria: (EI) 20110223.0599'. - Mod.CP]

Confirming the development to newsmen in Yola, the state capital, the
head of the State Epidemiological Unit of the ministry, Dr Bwalki
Barem Dilli, said though the situation has been brought under control,
it would have been more devastating but for the recent integrated
campaign embarked upon in all the councils by the ministry.

Meanwhile, the commissioner for health, Dr Lawal Hamidu, while
speaking to newsmen on the development, confirmed that the 3 medical
doctors affected by the Lassa fever outbreak have since been taken to
the National Hospital, Abuja and Arowa Specialist Hospital in Edo
State for proper treatment.

Commenting on the role played by the Federal Ministry of Health at
curbing the spread of the diseases, Hamidu explained that the Federal
Ministry of Health had donated about 1000 doses of anti-virus drugs to
the state to combat and control the epidemic.

While denying knowledge of an outbreak of chickenpox as being
rumoured in some quarters, the commissioner said the ministry only
recorded an outbreak of measles, and that the state was lucky to have
towards the end of January [2011] embarked on integrated measles
campaign, which, according to him, was carried out in the entire
northern region to curtail the spread of the disease.

He recalled with dismay the damage done by an earlier outbreak in
2005, and applauded the efforts of the Federal Government for coming
up with the catch-up campaign, where children below 15 years were
immunised. He then advised communities, individuals to avoid sleeping
in crowded rooms, but to ensure that they keep their environment
clean, especially now that the state is experiencing hot and dry
weather.
