A 7-year-old alpaca in Camden County and a 2-year-old gelding horse in Ocean County are the 4th and 5th reported animal cases of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), a serious, mosquito-borne illness, in New Jersey this year [2019].

The alpaca's vaccination history was unknown and it was euthanized earlier this month [August 2019].

Three horses in Ocean County, including a 12-year-old mare, and 1 horse in Monmouth County have also tested positive for EEE and were each euthanized within the last month.

Just 2 weeks after reporting Wisconsin's 1st 2019 case of eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) in Barron County, the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection (WDATCP) Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (VDL) announced on 14 Aug 2019 it had confirmed a 2nd horse had EEE, this time in Waushara County. The unvaccinated 13-year-old Standardbred mare exhibited neurologic signs and was euthanized on 13 Aug 2019. Test results confirmed she was EEE-positive on 19 Aug 2019. Her signs included ataxia, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), fever, recumbency (down and unable to rise), and seizures.

"EEE is fatal in more than 90 percent of cases, yet it's preventable through vaccination," said Julie McGwin, DVM, equine program manager for the Division of Animal Health at WDATCP. "If your horse is showing neurological signs, contact your veterinarian for a diagnosis.

"Signs of EEE are similar to other diseases [such as West Nile virus]," she added. "EEE is based on mosquito populations, and while people cannot get EEE from horses, mosquitoes can transmit EEE to both horses and people."

Eastern equine encephalomyelitis is caused by the eastern equine encephalitis virus, for which wild birds are a natural reservoir. Mosquitoes that feed on EEE-infected birds can transmit the virus to humans, horses, and other birds. Horses do not develop high enough levels of these viruses in their blood to be contagious to other animals or humans. Because of the high mortality rate in horses and humans, EEE is regarded as one of the most serious mosquito-borne diseases in the United States.

Tips for preventing mosquito-borne diseases include:
[for humans]
- Avoid mosquito bites: use insect repellent when outdoors, especially from dusk to dawn.
- Look for EPA-labeled products containing active ingredients such as DEET, picaridin (KBR3023), or oil of lemon eucalyptus (p-menthane 3,8-diol).
- Apply more repellent, according to label instructions, if mosquitoes start to bite.
- Mosquito-proof homes: fix or install window and door screens, and cover or eliminate empty containers with standing water where mosquitoes can lay eggs.

Protect your horses:
- Veterinarians recommend commercially available licensed vaccines against EEE for all horses in the United States. Horses should be vaccinated at least annually (recommendations vary in high-risk areas). It's not too late this year to vaccinate your horses.
- Use horse approved insect repellents to protect horses.
- If possible, put horses in stables, stalls, or barns during the prime mosquito exposure hours of dusk and dawn.
- Eliminate standing water, drain water troughs, and empty buckets at least weekly.
- Stock water tanks with fish consuming mosquito larvae (contact your local mosquito control for assistance), or use mosquito "dunks" (solid "donuts" of _Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis_ [BTi], which are nontoxic to horses) available at hardware stores.

A horse in Methuen has EEE [eastern equine encephalitis], according to Mayor James Jajuga and police Chief Joseph Solomon.

City officials will meet Monday afternoon [26 Aug 2019] to discuss how to address the situation, which Jajuga called "critical."

"When there's an animal with it, there's heightened concern for people," he said.

The city is following Department of Public Health guidelines and advising all residents to limit their time outdoors after sundown. Residents should strongly consider cancelling or rescheduling any planned outdoor activities until further notice, city officials say.

Officials in Andover, Boxford, and Pelham, New Hampshire have also received recent reports of mosquitoes testing positive for EEE.

After learning of the infected Methuen horse, Andover raised its EEE risk from moderate to high.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the EEE virus is a rare cause of brain infections or encephalitis. EEE causes very few human cases each year but can be fatal or leave victims with serious, lifelong complications.

The hours from dusk to dawn are peak biting times for many mosquitoes. If you are outdoors at any time and notice mosquitoes around you, take steps to avoid being bitten by moving indoors, covering up, and/or wearing repellent.

Health officials say homeowners should limit the number of places around property for mosquitoes to breed by either draining or getting rid of items that hold water. Check rain gutters and drains. Empty any unused flowerpots and wading pools and change water in birdbaths frequently.

There are vaccines for horses to help protect them from this disease. Is the word not getting out to vaccinate your horse? Or did these people vaccinate early in the year? EEE immunity wanes fairly quickly and may require revaccinating every 3-4 months in areas where EEE is most prevalent.

While horses are primarily affected, this disease can affect alpacas and humans. Mosquito repellent specific for horses is most appropriate and should be used on your animal.

Please use mosquito repellent on yourself to help prevent mosquitoes from biting you and transferring the disease to you. While humans are quite susceptible to the disease, there is no vaccine for humans as there is for horses. - Mod.TG]
