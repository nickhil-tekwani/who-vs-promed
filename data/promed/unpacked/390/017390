"Contagious viral disease 'nodular dermatitis', which spread among cattle, has been registered close to the Bulgarian border." District governor of Blagoevgrad [Bulgaria], Biser Mihaiylov, announced the news at an extraordinary sitting of the Regional Epizootic Committee on Thursday [9 Jul 2015], a reporter of Radio FOCUS - Pirin announced.

The Regional Epizootic Committee will take preventive measures in order to avoid the spread of the disease in the territory of Blagoevgrad District.

This viral disease is manifested by fever and inflammation of the skin with the formation of characteristic nodules. This category includes the clinical presentations of multiple nodules, draining tracts, or severe crusted or exudative lesions. The disease is found only among bovine animals transmitted by blood-sucking insects.

The disease is characterized by [a decrease in animal production], including dairy and meat products, reduced quality of leather products, [affecting] the estrous cycle of cattle and, generally, economic losses.

[Lumpy skin disease (LSD, knopvelsiekte) is an OIE-listed pox disease of cattle characterised by fever, nodules on the skin, mucous membranes and internal organs, emaciation, enlarged lymph nodes, oedema of the skin, and sometimes death. The disease is of economic importance as it can cause a temporary reduction in milk production, temporary or permanent sterility in bulls, damage to hides and death due to secondary bacterial infections. Various strains of capripoxvirus are responsible for the disease. These are antigenically indistinguishable from strains causing sheep pox and goat pox yet distinct at the genetic level. LSD has a partially different geographical distribution from sheep and goat pox, suggesting that cattle strains of capripoxvirus do not infect and transmit between sheep and goats. Transmission of LSD virus is thought to be predominantly by insects, natural contact transmission in the absence of insect vectors being inefficient. Lumpy skin disease occurs in most African countries.

LSD has been spreading throughout the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Asia since 2012. The countries already officially known to be infected are Azerbaijan, Cyprus (North), Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Palestinian Autonomous Territories and Turkey. Syria is regarded as infected since the earliest stages of the regional epizootic which started in 2012, with wide spread of the virus, but no official information has been submitted. LSD is endemic in Egypt. To see the location of outbreaks officially reported since 2012, please go to OIE's interactive map at http://tinyurl.com/pfrx4ye (click on the cluster, zoom in).

According to Turkey's official information to the OIE, LSD started, adjacent to the Syrian border, on 6 Aug 2013. Since then, 22 follow-up reports have been submitted, the last one on 22 Jul 2014 with details of 90 new outbreaks recorded during 2014. This brought the total number of LSD outbreaks in Turkey, since the start of the epizootic, to 236. The mentioned last report included the following comment: "The event cannot be considered resolved, but the situation is sufficiently stable. No more follow-up reports will be sent. Information about this disease will be included in the next 6-monthly reports." A map showing all 236 outbreaks officially reported from the start of the epizootic (6 Aug 2013), as of 22 Jul 2014, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=14106. Subscribers may see, in the map, the distance between the most western outbreaks and the European territories situated to the west of Turkey, as of July 2014. According to the current media report from Bulgaria, the disease may have moved, in the meantime, further westwards. Official update from Turkey would be helpful.

Blagoevgrad is situated in south west Bulgaria, bordering Greece and Macedonia, which are not known nor suspected to be infected by LSD. The penetration, if at all, is more likely to be expected on the borders with (LSD-infected) Turkey, on the south eastern regions of Bulgaria. Have concerns been expressed also in these regions? (See map at http://www.visittobulgaria.com/visit/practical_info/maps_collection/cities_and_regions.) Clarification would be helpful. - Mod.AS]
