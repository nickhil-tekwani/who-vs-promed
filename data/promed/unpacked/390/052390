[Lebanon's] Ministry of Health issued a statement on Thursday [21 Apr 2016] sounding the alarm on the spread of H5 bird flu in the village of Al-Nabi Sheeth in the Bekaa Valley of Lebanon, in more than one chicken farm. An emergency plan has been duly activated to contain the spread of this disease.

Bird flu, or avian influenza, is a viral infection spread from bird to bird. Technically, H5N1 is a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus. It's deadly to most birds. And it's deadly to humans and to other mammals that catch the virus from birds. Since the 1st human case in 1997, H5N1 has killed nearly 60 per cent of the people who have been infected.

Bird flu symptoms in people can vary. Symptoms may start out as normal flu-like symptoms. This can worsen to become a severe respiratory disease that can be fatal. In February 2005, researchers in Viet Nam reported human cases of bird flu in which the virus infected the brain and digestive tract of 2 children. Both died. These cases make it clear that bird flu in humans may not always look like typical cases of flu.

Scientists say avian influenza is not easily transmitted from birds to humans. It is not impossible, but it doesn't happen easily or very often. When people in Asia got "bird flu" from live domestic chickens and other types of poultry, it usually occurred when people slaughtered infected birds and got blood and excrement on their hands. In some Asian countries, it is even a custom for humans to consume raw poultry blood. These are obvious risk factors for the transmission of the virus from live birds to people. Unless human beings are directly exposed to blood or excrement of infected poultry, avian influenza is a disease of birds, not humans.

Poultry is safe when it is cooked to a minimum internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit [74 degrees Celsius]. It's best to use a thermometer to make sure this temperature is reached. While poultry is safe at 165 degrees F, it may be necessary to cook it to a higher temperature to reach a satisfactory level of doneness. [A chart of recommended temperatures for turkey and chicken meat is included.]

Those suffering any of the bird flu symptoms should instantly contact a doctor and inform the Ministry of Health. All citizens present in infested regions should abide by the instructions provided by the Ministry of Health and Agriculture, as well as the security forces, for their own safety.

[The village Abu Chit (Al-Nabi Sheeth) is situated in the Bekaa valley, mid-east Lebanon, about 55 km [about 34 miles] north-west of Damascus, the capital of neighboring Syria (map at http://tinyurl.com/go3ggf3).

The available reports mention H5 without further details of the strain; the Ministry of Health press release refers to the hazards of HPAI H5N1, indicative of this zoonotic virus strain being suspected; final identity of the causal agent is anticipated soon.

Other Lebanese Media sources, in Arabic, include additional information. According to the An Nahar daily of 21 Apr 2016 (at http://www.annahar.com/article/361195 [in Arabic]), a delegation from the Ministry of Health has visited the affected location and a press conference held by the local municipality and the Ministry of Agriculture. It was claimed that "the epidemic is controlled and there is no fear in humans so far", that epidemiological investigations have been initiated and steps to cull infected animals undertaken. The said media report further states that workers on the affected farms are monitored.

HPAI H5N1 has never been reported from Lebanon, nor from Syria. According to Lebanon's information on OIE's WAHID interface, highly pathogenic avian influenza last occurred in this country in 1994, many years before the 1st emergence of the zoonotic strain H5N1.

On 12 May 2015, Israel reported to the OIE an outbreak of HPAI H5N1 in a turkey farm in Bezet, a village situated on the border of southern Lebanon (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150512.3357484, and a map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=17712). The outbreak was controlled/eradicated by stamping out; no additional cases were recorded in the region, within Israel. Israel's northern district, bordering Lebanon, is an intensive poultry area, producing about 2 billion table-eggs annually (65 per cent of the total national production) and about 100 000 metric tonnes poultry meat (25 per cent of the national broiler industry).

National and regional alertness is essential; official OIE notification is to be expected soon. - Mod.AS
