Sheep Infected with Brucellosis in Kazakhstan
-----------------------------------------------
Kazakhstan's Ministry of Emergency Situations announced on 31 Mar
2007 that sheep in East Kazakhstan State's Zaysan District have been
found to be infected with brucellosis. More than 500 sheep that may
be infected will be culled and destroyed.
According to Kazakhstan media reports on 31 Mar 2007, this outbreak
was discovered in winter grazing lands near Kensay Village in Zaysan
District. Kazakh epidemic prevention agencies are conducting medical
surveillance of those who had contact with sick sheep.
Brucellosis is an infectious, zoonotic disease. After cattle and
sheep become infected with brucellosis, infertility, miscarriage and
fetal death can occur.
When this illness is spread from cattle and sheep to humans, patients
can develop fever, profuse sweating, weakness, joint and muscle pain
and other symptoms.

[Though both _Brucella abortus_ and _B. melitensis_ are reportedly
present in Kazakhstan, it may be assumed that this outbreak has been
caused by _Brucella melitensis_, a zoonosis which affects mainly
sheep and goats. Caprine and ovine brucellosis (the OIE terminology
for _B. melitensis_ infection) is, according to OIE's Handistatus
database, endemic in Kazakhstan (information available until 2004). -
