Dengue Fever Epidemic Declared in 13 of 22 Federal States of Venezuela
----------------------------------------------------------------------
So far this year there have been 19 085 cases of dengue fever in Venezuela,
a number close to double that reported for the same period last year (10
434 cases), representing an 83% increase. According to the report issued by
the Ministry of Health and Social Development, the increase registered over
the past few weeks has forced health authorities to declare a state of
epidemic in 13 federal states (from a total of 22). The situation is safe
only in the Amazonas and Apure states.
The communities with the largest number of registered accumulated cases are
Miranda and Lara, with increases of 15% and 13% respectively, as compared
to the same period last year. According to Dr. Eva Rodriguez of the Health
Department of the Metropolitan Mayor's Office [of Caracas, the cause of
the proliferation of the epidemic is the beginning of the rainy season,
when every deposit of water, small as it may be, becomes a breeding ground
for mosquitoes. This year, the rationing of water in the country's main
cities [with the resulting proliferation of domestic containers for water
collection, which become potential mosquito reservoirs has also
contributed to the increase in the number of cases of dengue fever, and,
according to Rodriguez, has made it impossible to apply effective
prophylactic measures.
In addition, the appearance [in 2000 of a new serotype, Dengue virus type
3, which had never circulated in Venezuela, facilitated the dissemination
of the infection transmitted by the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ or "white
legs," as it is called throughout Venezuela. Dengue virus types 1, 2, and 4
were known in Venezuela, but type 3 began circulating last October. Since
it is a new virus and, therefore, the population is highly susceptible,
dissemination was very fast and caused what Rodriguez described as an
explosion impossible to control.
In order to avoid more people becoming infected, the Mayor's Office has
established a strategy to eliminate mosquito breeding grounds and to
increase the fumigation of infected homes, particularly in the localities
of Parroquia Sucre, El Valle, La Pastora, Antimano, El Cementerio, and La
Vega, where the greatest incidence has been reported. Preventive measures
include talks and workshops in all the city's outpatient clinics and a
communications campaign aimed at eliminating water deposits that could
become mosquito breeding grounds.

[The recent introduction of Dengue virus serotype 3 into a population not
previously exposed, but with existing levels of antibodies against the
other 3 serotypes of the virus -- which have circulated freely in the
country for several decades -- along with the difficulties in the domestic
water supply faced by several urban centers, have created favorable
conditions for a widespread epidemic of classical dengue fever and
hemorrhagic dengue fever in the whole country. - Mod.JT
