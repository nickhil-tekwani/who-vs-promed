Soybean fields having problems with white mold disease
------------------------------------------------------
Soybean producers in northern Illinois have experienced problems with
a disease called sclerotinia stem rot, or white mold, this year
[2009]. The disease is most severe in years that have wet, cool
conditions during the flowering period, especially in fields or
portions of fields that have restricted air movement, such as drilled
or other field situations where the canopy has closed quickly.

The disease is characterized by dead plants that appear in midseason
and have a white fungal mold growing on dead tissue of the stem,
often just above the soil line. No soybean varieties are completely
resistant to white mold, but some are less susceptible than others.
Currently, 2 foliar fungicides are registered [in the USA] for
control of white mold in soybeans. A biological control product
containing a parasite of the white mold fungus's sclerotia is also
being studied at the University of Illinois.

White mold stings northern Indiana soybean fields
-------------------------------------------------
The disease can produce heavy yield losses. It was once a rare
disease in Indiana soybeans but isn't so rare any more. It seems to
be prevalent this year [2009], especially in northern and northwest
Indiana. It's a disease that also attracts attention in other states,
especially in cooler climates [for Ohio see ProMED-mail post 20090817.2912].

The organism can persist in the soil once it invades an area. Then
every time the field is in soybeans in rotation, there is the threat
of infection. Weather conditions play a role in whether or not the
disease becomes severe in any one year, and in the timing of the
outbreak of the disease. One way farmers in northwestern Indiana have
combated white mold is to revert to wider row spacing that provides
for more air circulation within the soybean canopy.

White mold, a disease that can drastically cut yields, started to get
the attention of farmers in Iowa in late August [2009]. This year
white mold disease is so widespread that agronomists report observing
it in many soybean fields in southern Iowa, too.

In northern Iowa, patches of soybeans killed by this disease were so
abundant that they were found in nearly every soybean field during a
field day on [18 Sep 2009]. For most of the fields, the disease was
scattered in small patches.

Harvest the diseased patches last to combat white mold.

[White mould, or sclerotinia stem rot, of soybean is caused by
_Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_. This fungus is one of the most
nonspecific and successful of plant pathogens with around 400 known
hosts. Symptoms vary on different hosts. On soybean, white fungal
growth appears on the stems leading to wilting and final death of the
plant. Severe yield losses have been reported in soybean and other
affected crops.

The pathogen is primarily soil-borne and can survive for many years
in soil as sclerotia. It is also spread by infected plant material
(including seeds), mechanical means, and wind-borne spores. Risk of
crop infection depends on the previous disease history of an area as
well as weather conditions. Disease management includes mainly
cultural practices (for example the wide row spacing mentioned above)
and fungicide applications.

White mould has progressed in recent years to become a threat to
soybean production in the US. This year (2009), it has also caused
problems for peanut producers in the country in the state of Georgia
(see link below).
