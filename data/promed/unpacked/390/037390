Answer to Promed -mail Thu 28/5/98 on rabies post-exposure prophylaxis by
Chad Meyer/American Embassy.
Question : Has anyone collected data showing decays of rabies titers after 3
pre-exposure injections?
Answer: Yes.
Please refer to our paper of Strady, Lang et al.; that was just published
in the Journal of Infectious Diseases " Antibody persistence following
pre-exposure regimens of cell-culture rabies vaccines : 10 year follow-up
and proposal for a new booster policy" . Journal Infect. Dis. 1998; 177 :
1290-5. We clearly evidence[d the interest of a one year booster after the
3 dose primary series. In addition the antibody RFFIT titers 2 weeks after
the 1 year booster allowed prediction of long-term immunity. Good
responders with titer higher or equal to 30 IU/mL were protected for at
least 10 years.
