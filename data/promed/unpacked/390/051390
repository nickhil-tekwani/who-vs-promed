Additionally, Russia has reported 2 separate cases of African swine
fever within the last month. Russia had declared their 2007 outbreak
to be over in June of 2009. There was widespread dissemination in
Georgia, Armenia and Russia starting 2007 resulting in unprecedented
losses of animals from this disease, which hadn't been seen in the
region for decades; see African swine fever - Georgia: OIE
