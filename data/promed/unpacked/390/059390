Human cases of influenza at the human-animal interface, January 2014-April 2015
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This report describes the epidemiological and virological features of the laboratory-confirmed human cases of infection with avian influenza A(H5N1), avian influenza A(H7N9), and other non-seasonal influenza viruses, with onset of illness dates from January 2014 through April 2015. The report also includes selected findings from the analysis of the cumulative number of human cases of influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) reported to WHO since 2003 and 2013, respectively.

Influenza A(H5) viruses
-----------------------
A total of 191 human cases of influenza ... [more]

Discussion
----------
As in previous years, human cases of infection with non-seasonal influenza viruses remain rare with sporadic cases occurring following exposure to infected poultry or environments contaminated with infectious viruses. There has been no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of any of these non-seasonal influenza viruses. As long as these viruses continue to circulate in animal populations and people are exposed to them, further sporadic human infections are likely.

Several important events have occurred since early 2014 with regard to non-seasonal influenza viruses. Firstly, Egypt suffered a dramatic increase in reported human infections with influenza A(H5N1) viruses from December 2014 through March 2015. The epidemiological characteristics of the human cases remained essentially unchanged from previous years and no significant genetic changes have yet been detected that could explain a change in virus transmissibility. More than 1/3rd of the human cases reported from Egypt were in children aged less than 10 years and the CFR remained lower compared to human cases reported from other countries. Differences in CFR between countries may depend on host factors (genetic susceptibility), the genetic diversity of the infecting viruses, access to health care and health seeking behaviour. The majority of the human cases which have occurred in Egypt also received prompt treatment and hospitalization.

The 1st human cases of infection with influenza A(H5N6) also occurred in 2014. This virus is a genetic reassortant derived from influenza A(H5N1) viruses and other avian influenza viruses. It has now been detected in poultry in several countries in Asia. This virus falls in the HA H5 genetic clade 2.3.4.4 which includes other influenza A(H5) reassortants, such as A(H5N1), A(H5N2), and A(H5N8), that have spread rapidly from Asia to bird populations in Europe and North America. While no human infections with these viruses have been reported to date, it is possible that these influenza A(H5) viruses could infect humans who are in contact with infected birds.

In addition to the human infections with the various A(H5) viruses described above, influenza A(H7N9) viruses caused a 3rd wave of human infections in China, and it is likely that these viruses have become established in the local poultry populations.

The continuous evolution of influenza viruses, unprecedented reassortment events, and detections of non-seasonal viruses in humans emphasizes the importance of continued surveillance at the human-animal interface. It is critical that health-are providers are alert to the possibility of human cases of infections with non-seasonal influenza viruses and suspicious of any clusters of respiratory illnesses especially in at-risk individuals.

Detailed epidemiological and clinical investigations are important for learning more about the risk factors for infection as well as the clinical course of infections in humans. Virus characterization, in particular antigenic characterization and full-genome sequencing, is essential to assess the pandemic potential of these viruses, for which close collaboration between animal health and public health partners is indispensable.

WHO continues to stress the importance of global monitoring of influenza viruses and recommends that all Member States strengthen their routine influenza surveillance. All human infections with an influenza A virus that has the potential to cause a pandemic should be reported to WHO in accordance with the IHR (2005).

Possession, Use, and Transfer of Select Agents and Toxins; Addition of Certain Influenza Virus Strains to the List of Select Agents and Toxins
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action
------
Notice Of Proposed Rulemaking And Request For Comments.

Summary
---------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) within the [US] Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is proposing to add certain influenza virus strains to the list of HHS select agents and toxins. Specifically, we are proposing to add the influenza viruses that contain the hemagglutinin (HA) from the Goose Guangdong/1/96 lineage (the influenza viruses that contain the hemagglutinin (HA) from the A/Gs/Gd/1/96 lineage), including wild-type viruses, as a non-Tier 1 select agent. We are also proposing to add any influenza viruses that contain the HA from the A/Gs/Gd/1/96 lineage that were made transmissible among mammals by respiratory droplets in a laboratory as a Tier 1 select agent. We have determined that these influenza viruses have the potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety.

In 2012 (http://www.idsociety.org/uploadedFiles/IDSA/Policy_and_Advocacy/Current_Topics_and_Issues/Emerging_Infections_and_Biothreats/Letters/To_Agencies/IDSA%20Comments%20on%20H5N1%20Select%20Agent%20Proposal%20121412.pdf), Robbin Weyant, PhD, Director, Division of Select Agents and Toxins, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recommended that influenza viruses containing the hemagglutinin from the Goose/Guangdong/1/96 Lineage be classified as a select agent.

Several criteria were considered, including 1) the ability of the strain to be transmitted from person to person, 2) the characteristics of the strain in question, compared to naturally circulating strains, and 3) the availability of medical countermeasures (i.e., drugs, vaccines and diagnostics) to mitigate the risk of disease. Circulating HPAI H5N1 influenza viruses containing the hemagglutinin (HA) from the Goose/Guangdong/1/96 lineage do not currently pose a severe threat to public health and safety because they are not readily transmitted between humans. However, H5N1 strains with increased mammalian transmissibility do pose a severe threat to public health and safety, and it is crucial that extensive biosafety and biosecurity measures be taken to prevent accidental release or an act of bioterrorism. ...

IDSA [Infectious Diseases Society of America] recommends that HPAI H5N1 influenza viruses containing the HA from the Goose/Guangdong/1/96 lineage viruses be regulated as select agents by HHS. H5N1 viruses are currently regulated as select agents by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) with a focus on agricultural animal health. The involvement of HHS in H5N1 select agent regulation will ensure that the impact on human health is considered when agents are being reviewed. ... [more at URL above]
