Fish importer announces monkfish recall
----------------------------------------
A frozen product labeled monkfish distributed in 3 states is being
recalled after 2 Chicago area people became ill after eating it, the
importer announced Thursday [24 May 2007]. Hong Chang Corporation of
Santa Fe Springs, CA., said it is recalling the product labeled as
monkfish because it may contain tetrodotoxin, a potent toxin.
While the frozen fish imported from China was labeled monkfish, the
company said it is concerned that it may be pufferfish because this
toxin is usually associated with certain types of pufferfish. Eating
foods containing tetrodotoxin can result in life-threatening illness
or death and the toxin cannot be destroyed by cooking or freezing.
The company said 2 people in the Chicago area became ill after eating
soup containing the fish. Analysis by the Food and Drug
Administration confirmed the presence of the toxin.
Some 282 22-pound boxes of the fish were distributed to wholesalers
in Illinois, California and Hawaii, according to the company
beginning in September [2006]. The fish was sold in retail stores,
restaurants and cash and carry stores in these regions.
The fish are individually packaged in clear plastic sleeves and
placed in a plastic liner which is inside a cardboard box. There are
no lot numbers on the box. Labels on one panel read "MONK FISH GUTTED
AND HEAD-OFF PRODUCT OF CHINA". A 2nd box panel bears nutritional
facts and the following, "Ingredients: Monk fish; Imported by: Hong
Chang Corp., Santa Fe Springs, CA 90670; Product of China (P.R.C.)."
Consumers who have purchased this monkfish can return it to the place
of purchase for a full refund. Care should be exercised in handling
the fish as the tetrodotoxin may be present on the skin and flesh of
the fish. Wash hands thoroughly after handling.
Consumers with questions may contact the company at 1-562-309-0068.
People who may have consumed these products and have concerns are
encouraged to contact their health care provider. Illnesses
associated with consumption of these products should be reported to
the nearest FDA district offices and to the local health authority.

[Tetrodotoxin, a very potent toxin, selectively blocks the
voltage-sensitive sodium channels of excitable tissues and neuronal
transmission in skeletal muscles. In humans, paresthesias begin 10-45
minutes after ingestion, usually as tingling of the tongue and inner
surface of the mouth. Other common symptoms include vomiting,
lightheadedness, dizziness, feelings of doom, and weakness. Paralysis
spreads, and death can occur within 6 - 24 hours, often due to
paralysis of the muscles of respiration. Other signs include
salivation, muscle twitching, diaphoresis, pleuritic chest pain,
dysphagia, aphonia, and convulsions. Severe poisoning is indicated by
hypotension, bradycardia, depressed corneal reflexes, and fixed
dilated pupils. There is no specific antidote and treatment is often
supportive.
There are a number of different species of puffer fish or blow fish,
each of which produces a different concentration of the toxin. - Mod.TG]
