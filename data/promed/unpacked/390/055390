of _Clostridium difficile_ PCR ribotype 001 in southern Germany

-----------------------------------------------
In recent years, _Clostridium difficile_ infection (CDI) has emerged
as an increasing problem, both in in- and outpatients. In a rural
region of southern Germany, the annual number of _C. difficile_ toxin
(Tcd)-positive patients has increased from 95 to 796 in the period
from 2000 to 2007. Simultaneously, the proportion of positive tests
among all Tcd examinations has risen from 7.0 percent to 12.8
percent, indicating that the higher number of affected patients was
not solely due to an increase in the number of assays. Elevated
numbers of CDI have recently been associated with outbreaks of the
ribotype 027 strain, particularly in North America. This strain has
also been isolated in Europe, including in Germany. Ribotyping and
PCR testing for binary toxin genes of _C. difficile_ strains isolated
from in- and outpatients demonstrate a predominance (59 percent) of
_C. difficile_ ribotype 001, which exhibits antibiotic resistance to
erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin, but lacks binary toxin
genes. In summary, in our region of Germany, the number of patients
affected by CDI has increased, probably due to spread of _C.
difficile_ ribotype 001.

Introduction

Numbers of _C. difficile_ infections (CDI) are increasing in and
outside of Europe [1-5]. CDI in North America and partly also in
western Europe have often been attributed to outbreaks caused by the
hypervirulent strain NAP1/027 containing the binary toxin genes cdtA
and cdtB [1,3,6]. Recently, this strain has also been isolated from
patients in western Germany [7]. Different _C. difficile_ strains are
isolated in different European countries, suggesting a prevalence of
particular strains in local settings [8-10].

CDI is usually regarded as a nosocomial infection that can be
minimised by robust infection control practices and good antibiotic
stewardship. In some hospitals in Europe, it has become the most
frequent nosocomial disease, and, consequently, analyses of _C.
difficile_ epidemiology were restricted to hospital outbreaks [11].
However, community-acquired cases of CDI have been observed for a few
years now [12,13]. Interestingly, _C. difficile_ strains associated
with CDI in hospitalised patients were different from the ones
isolated from community cases [13].

Our laboratory is located in a rural area in southern Germany. In
this region, CDI is noticed as a growing nosocomial problem with
sporadic fatal cases. However, the available information about the
real extent of this apparent increase in CDI is limited. Furthermore,
no studies have been done on distinct _C. difficile_ strains in
Germany or defined regions in Germany. We therefore collected data on
the number of patients known to excrete _C. difficile_ toxin (Tcd) in
stool and on the number of patients analysed for Tcd. PCR was
performed on _C. difficile_ isolates from outpatients and from
patients treated in 2 hospitals located in southern Germany in order
to gain knowledge about the epidemiological background of these
regional strains.

Here we present data about the prevalence of a quinolone- and
erythromycin-resistant _C. difficile_ ribotype 001 strain in southern
Germany.

Patients and Methods

Laboratory and hospitals setting: The Synlab Medical Care Service
analyses laboratory samples from about 40 hospitals and more than
2000 physicians serving outpatients. In 2006, a total of 161 000
microbiological samples were examined. _C. difficile_ was isolated
from Tcd-positive stool samples from patients diagnosed at 2
hospitals (A and B) and from outpatients. Hospital A is a primary
health care hospital with 270 beds comprising 2 tertiary university
hospital facilities (cardiology, gastroenterology). In 2006, 10 793
patients were admitted to that hospital (74 146 patient days).
Hospital B is a primary health care hospital with 135 beds, and 4886
patients (34 811 patient days) were admitted to that clinic in 2006.

Epidemiolologic analysis of _C. difficile_ in South Germany: Numbers
of Tcd-positve stool samples and numbers of Tcd-positive patients
were evaluated by the Hybase system (Cymed AG, Bochum, Germany)
linked to the laboratory data system "promed open" (mcs, Eltville,
Germany). Hybase
<http://www.cymed.de/download_hy.php>
is a computer programme that supports the surveillance of bacterial
pathogens, e.g. calculation and documentation of the number of
notifiable bacterial species. Data (age, sex, outpatients versus
inpatients, taking into account where they were treated) from
patients with Tcd-positive stool in 2006 were documented.

_C. difficile_ toxin analysis, culture and antibiotic susceptibility
testing: Stool samples from inpatients of hospitals A and B were
collected between May 2006 and March 2007 and tested for _C.
difficile_. Samples from outpatients were collected between March and
April 2007. Tcd was examined by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) detecting toxin A and B (R-Biopharm AG, Darmstadt,
Germany). Bacterial cultures were grown on _C. difficile_-selective
agar containing cefoxitin and cycloserine (Heipha, Eppelheim, Germany;
<http://www.heipha.de/db/files/209e.pdf>)
under anaerobic conditions. Identification of _C. difficile_ was
performed on rapid ID 32 A system (identification system for
anaerobes, Biomerieux, Nurtingen, Germany). Antibiotic susceptibility
was tested using ATB ANA strips (susceptibility test for strict
anaerobic bacteria, Biomerieux, Nurtingen, Germany) according to the
manufacturer's instructions or alternatively in an E-test procedure
(for erythromycin, ciprofloxacine, moxifloxacine, cefotaxime;
AB-Biodisk, Solna, Sweden). E-test results were confirmed at the
German Consiliary Laboratories for _C. difficile_ (Mainz) or
gastrointestinal infections (Freiburg). Presence of binary toxin
genes was examined at the German Consiliary Laboratory for _C.
difficile_ (Mainz) according to Stubbs et al. [14].

Ribotyping of _C. difficile_ strains. Ribotyping was performed at the
German Consiliary Laboratory for gastrointestinal infections
(Freiburg). PCR ribotyping was performed according to he protocol of
Bidet et al. [15] resulting in so-called "ribotype Freiburg." In
previous comparative analyses, representative isolates of each
ribotype Freiburg had been sent to the Anaerobe Reference Laboratory
in Cardiff for re-typing according to the "Cardiff" PCR ribotyping
library in order to establish the correlation between ribotype
Freiburg and the commonly used ribotype nomenclature of Stubbs et al.
[16]. It was therefore possible to relate local PCR results not only
to "ribotype Freiburg" but also to European _C. difficile_ ribotypes.

Results

The number of patients analysed for Tcd increased by 458 percent
(from 1358 to 6214; Figure 1), but the actual number of Tcd-positive
samples increased by 838 percent in the same period of time (from 95
to 796). The percentage of Tcd-positive patients increased from 7.0
percent in 2000 to 12.8 percent in 2007, with 2 peaks in 2003 (15.0
percent) and in 2006 (17.1 percent). The peak in 2003 predominantly
resulted from a high proportion of Tcd-positive outpatients (18.0
percent). In contrast, the peak in 2006 was caused by Tcd-positive
inpatients (17.8 percent).

In summary, these data indicate that the increasing numbers of CDI in
this region are real and not simply a result of increasing analysis
efforts. Furthermore, not only hospitalised patients but also
non-hospitalised patients were affected by CDI.

A total of 784 patients were registered in our database, 17.3 percent
of which were outpatients. Looking at the median age, the majority
were elderly patients. Interestingly, the median age of outpatients
(69 years) was lower than that of inpatients (77 years). In addition,
Tcd-positive women tended to be older than Tcd-positive men.

To assess the cause for the increasing numbers of Tcd-positive
patients via spread of hypervirulent _C. difficile_ [ribotype] 027,
ribotyping was performed on [22] isolates from Tcd-positive stool
samples previously collected from outpatients and from patients
treated in 2 different hospitals in southern Germany (Hospitals A and
B). At least 7 different _C. difficile_ ribotypes could be
identified. While _C. difficile_ ribotype 001 was isolated from 11
patients [according to their Table 2, 4 outpatients, 7 inpatients and
one additional patient from an unknown location were positive for
ribotype 001], other types were only isolated once from a single
patient. _C. difficile_ ribotype 001 was isolated from inpatients of
both hospitals and was also common in outpatients, indicating a
predominance of this strain in this region. Ribotype 001 _C.
difficile_ lacked the binary toxin genes but was resistant to
quinolone antibiotics (ciprofloxacine, moxifloxacine) as well as to
erythromycin, cefotaxime (MIC greater than 16 microg/mL) and
clindamycin. However, ribotype 001 strains were susceptible to
ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam,
imipenem, vancomycin and metronidazole.

Discussion

Worldwide -- as well as in Germany -- there is a discussion about
increasing case numbers of CDI-affected patients [1-5]. In this
study, we demonstrate that the number of Tcd-positive patients
increased markedly in southern Germany in the period between 2000 and
2006. However, the percentage of Tcd-positive patients also increased
markedly during this period (from 7.0 to 12.8 percent), showing a
maximum in 2006 (17.1 percent). This higher ratio indicates that the
increased number of Tcd-positive patients is a real phenomenon and
not solely due to the fact that examination efforts were stepped up.
Between 2006 and 2007, the number of CDI-affected patients remained
constant, although the number of patients examined for CDI increased.
This finding suggests that the intensified infection control measures
may have been successful in preventing the nosocomial spread of _C.
difficile_. However, the possibility to separate between nosocomial
and community acquired CDI is limited by the lack of patient data.

In agreement with earlier studies [4,5], Tcd-positive stool samples
were mainly obtained from elderly patients. The fact that 136 of 784
Tcd-positive patients (17.3 percent) in 2006 were outpatients clearly
shows that CDI was not restricted to hospitalised patients. On the
other hand, the median age of Tcd-positive inpatients was higher than
that of Tcd-positive outpatients, an indication that CDI in younger
people has a milder course and does not require hospital admission.

The _C. difficile_ 027 strain was detected in Germany for the 1st
time in 2007 [7]. However, the ribotyping results presented here
reveal that this strain was not prevalent in northern Bavaria. In
contrast, multi-resistant _C. difficile_ 001 were frequently found.
For this analysis, _C. difficile_ were cultured from Tcd-positive
stool samples from in- and outpatients. The hospitalised patients had
been treated at 2 hospitals located about 200 km apart. Since _C.
difficile_ type 001 was also isolated from outpatients, it is obvious
that this strain is predominant in southern Germany. All tested
ribotype 001 _C. difficile_ proved to be resistant to erythromycin
and moxifloxacine in the antibiotic susceptibility testing, a feature
commonly observed for ribotypes 001, 027 and 106 [6,17]. Ribotyping
and binary toxin gene analysis showed that all of these _C.
difficile_ strains were different from the NAP1/027 strain. Recently,
it has been discussed whether ribotype 027 strains could be more
virulent than other ribotypes [11,18]. Only scarce clinical
information -- reported anecdotally -- is available about the death
of several patients. Nevertheless, it is clear that severe courses of
CDI in our region are not limited to ribotype 027 isolates.

Ribotyping further revealed that more than 50 percent of _C.
difficile_ isolates exhibited identical features, a possible
indication of clonal spread within the local population. In the case
of increased CDI case numbers due to admission of affected patients
bearing predominantly ribotype 001, proven clonality of _C.
difficile_ isolates by ribotyping might erroneously suggest
nosocomial spread. Under the given circumstances of many _C.
difficile_ isolates being clonally related, this typing method,
therefore, provides only limited information for outbreak analyses in
a defined hospital. Consequently, use of more discriminatory typing
methods, e.g. multi-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis
(MLVA), may be better suited for future epidemiological studies, at
least if ribotype 001 or other frequently occurring ribotypes are
involved [19].

In summary, the present study shows an increase of Tcd-positive
patient numbers in southern Germany. Multi-resistant _C. difficile_
ribotype 001 is prevalent in southern Germany, and this strain is
thought to be responsible for severe, if not fatal, cases of CDI. In
due course, more discriminatory methods may be able to improve our
understanding of the epidemiology of this successful strain.

[_Clostridium difficile_ is the most common cause of bacterial
diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis in hospitalized patients.
Antimicrobial therapy is the most important risk factor associated
with the acquisition of _C. difficile_. The clinical features of
infection are related to production of exotoxins secreted during
bacterial growth. Toxigenic strains produce 2 cellular cytotoxins,
TcdA and TcdB. Some strains also produce another toxin, binary toxin.

Outbreaks of _C. difficile_ infection (CDI) with increased severity,
high relapse rate, poor response to antimicrobial therapy, and
significant mortality have been related to the emergence in North
America and Europe of a new, hypervirulent _C. difficile_ strain,
ribotype 027. This particular ribotype 027 characteristically
hyper-produces toxin and is resistant to fluoroquinolones, the use of
which is a risk factor for its acquisition.

Distribution of ribotypes varies among countries and over time.
However, ribotyping lacks sufficient discrimination. Other methods to
subtype isolates include arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction
(AP-PCR), REP-PCR (repetitive sequence-based PCR using repetitive
extragenic palindromic primers) and PFGE. Ongoing epidemiological
surveillance of cases of CDI, with periodic characterization of the
strains involved, is required to detect clonal clustering in time and
space. Even outbreaks in a single facility may be due to multiple
clones (Samore MH, et al. Wide diversity of _Clostridium difficile_
types at a tertiary referral hospital. J Infect Dis 1994; 170:615),
and environmental isolates may differ from patient isolates in a
single facility (Cohen SH, et al. Isolation of various genotypes of
_Clostridium difficile_ from patients and the environment in an
oncology ward. Clin Infect Dis 1997; 24:889).

The above report only ribotyped isolates from 22 out of the 784
patients in their database. How these 22 isolates were selected for
ribotyping is not specified, but they may have not been a random
sample. Also, the report does not specify the exact region in
southern Germany that was studied and does not say whether any of the
outpatients with CDI had any contact with a health care facility or
whether their infection was truly community-acquired.
Hospital-acquired strains may spread into the community from
discharged patients, but true community-onset raises the possibility
of acquisition from food and the role of animal reservoirs (see
<http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27774614/>).
Indeed, ribotype 078, which is reported to be an important pathogen
of CDAD in pigs
(<http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1933037>;
Goorhuis A, et al. _Clostridium difficile_ PCR ribotype 078: An
emerging strain in humans and in pigs? J Clin Microbiol
2008;46:1157), was identified in one of the German inpatients in the
above report. But, because ribotyping may not be sufficiently
discriminatory, isolates of ribotype 078 from animals and humans may
not necessarily be identical.
