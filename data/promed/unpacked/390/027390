The Council of Agriculture said on Tuesday [30 Jul 2013] that 2 more wild Formosan ferret-badgers have been reported to be infected with rabies, taking the number of confirmed rabies cases in Taiwan to 14 since an outbreak was reported in mid-July [2013].

The 2 new cases were detected in Nantou County's Renai township and Kaohsiung City's Meinong district, the council stated.

As of 29 Jul 2013, a total of 52 wild carnivorous animals had been tested for rabies and 14 were reported positive, it noted.

All of the 14 cases involved Formosan ferret-badgers from the mountainous areas, with 7 cases reported in Nantou County, one each in Yunlin County, Taichung City, and Tainan City, and 2 each in Kaohsiung City and Taitung County, according to the council.

[The 2 cases, described above, have been reported to the OIE in follow-up report No 3 by Chinese Taipei (OIE terminology for Taiwan) submitted Tue 30 Jul 2013. The report includes the following epidemiological comments: "One wild ferret-badger was found in Meinong Dist. of Kaohsiung City on 28 July 2013 and the other one wild ferret-badger which bit a person was captured in Ren'ai Township of Nantou County on 27 Jul 2013. These 2 wild ferret-badgers were sent to the Animal Health Research Institute (National Laboratory). The National Laboratory confirmed positive result of rabies by direct fluorescent antibody test on 29 Jul 2013. Intensified vaccination activities targeted at dogs and cats were conducted on the areas where these 2 wild animals were found, and the monitoring is ongoing."

The said follow-up report includes an interactive map, showing the locations of all 14 rabid ferret-badgers recorded thus far in Taiwan (zoom in). Their apparent spread over large parts of the island does not seem to support the assumption of a very recent virus introduction. The report and the map are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=13832. - Mod.AS
