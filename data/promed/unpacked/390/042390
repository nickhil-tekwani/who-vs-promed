Uganda: cattle markets closed in 7 districts
--------------------------------------------
Butcheries and livestock markets in 7 northern Uganda districts have
been closed due to an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD].
Veterinary officers in the affected districts said at least 300 head
of cattle had died of the disease. They added that the ban had also
affected beef sales over the weekend [3-4 Jan 2009].

The affected districts are Lira [47], Apac [5], Amuru [39], Amolatar
[3], Pader [68], Dokolo [16], and Oyam [67]. [In brackets, the
respective district numbers in the Northern Region (yellow) map at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Uganda>. - Mod.AS]

Lira veterinary officer Dr Wilson Okwir said at least 80 cattle had
died in Amac, Olilim, and other sub-counties. He said over 70 000
animals in the district were at risk of attack of the disease if they
are not vaccinated in time.

The Dokolo veterinary officer, Dr Richard Enyang, said 35 cattle had
died and that several villages bordering Amolatar and Kaberamaido
districts were infested with the disease.

In Amolatar, Dr Tamin Ebong said 75 cattle had died and that 55 000
were at risk of catching the disease. He added that disease
prevalence was highest in Muntu and Nakatiti.

In Oyam, Tom Ogwal said no deaths had been reported and all animal
entry points in the district had been closed. He warned those
disobeying the quarantine, saying they would be prosecuted, fined
[UGX] 2m [USD 1018] or serve a sentence of 6 years in prison upon
conviction. Ogwal said veterinary officers were assessing the
situation in the district.

In Amuru, Dr James Ukwir said 40 animals had died and over 2500 had
been affected in 3 sub-counties. He said Lamogi, Amuru, and Pabbo
sub-counties were affected. Ukwir said they would sensitise the
community on the disease. "They should eat meat that has been
inspected by veterinary officers to avoid complications," he said
[see commentary].

In Apac, Dr James Ongu-Elim said the quarantine took effect in
December [2008] and that markets in Aduku and Akwon had been closed
down. "We believe the measure will stop further spread of the disease
to other parts of the district," he said. "Farmers should cooperate
with veterinary officers to eliminate the disease," he advised.

Ongu said foot-and-mouth [disease] is a viral disease that affects
hoofed animals such as cattle, water buffalo, sheep, goats, and pigs.
He warned that the disease was fatal, especially to calves, and
drastically reduces milk output of affected cows during lactation.

He noted that although the disease does not affect humans, those
eating infected meat could spread it.

[The continued spread of FMD in Uganda's Northern Region is
indicative of an exposed susceptible, non-immune population; the 2
main possible reasons for such a situation is non-vaccination or the
use of an inefficient vaccine. Information on the identity of the
circulating FMDV serotype and of the serotype(s) included in the
applied vaccine(s) will be helpful.

The current and previous newswires from Uganda cite authorities'
warnings against the consumption of meat from FMD-infected animals.
It should be made clear that FMD is not zoonotic; the warnings seem
to reflect either addressing general food hygiene/meat inspection
purposes (avoiding consumption of decaying carcasses or uninspected
meat and organs), or the possible dissemination to animals of the
virus mechanically by persons engaged with the slaughter/handling of
such animals and/or their contaminated meat. - Mod.AS
