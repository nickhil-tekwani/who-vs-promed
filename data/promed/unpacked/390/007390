Salmonella in Victoria, 1997: the story so far:Lester R, et. al:
Abstract: The Infectious Diseases Unit of the Department of Human Services,
Victoria, reported an increased incidence of Salmonella infections in early
1997. To 21 April 1997, 944 notifications had been received, passing the
previous year's total of 915. Five outbreaks of five separate serovars
have been investigated and traced to their sources. The outbreaks, their
sources and the control measures under taken are described. Further
clusters of other Salmonella serovars are being investigated.
Conclusions: Detailed investigation of Salmonella clusters by a team of
public health officers has shown that successful results can be obtained,
even when the source of an outbreak is an unlabelled, distributed product,
as was the case with the two outbreaks involving smallgoods. The time taken
to find the source in these two outbreaks contrasts with the ease of finding
a cause in the case of a point source outbreak with a very high attack rate.
The high incidence of Salmonella in Victoria in 1997 may be [?have been -
MHJ] due to a higher load of organisms being present in meat coming from
abattoirs. This has [?had - MHJ] been combined with gross errors of food
handling in some cases, and minor errors in others.
Undoubtedly, mishandling by consumers has also contributed to the increased
incidence. The majority of these outbreaks occurred during and shortly after
the hottest summer ever recorded in Melbourne. The high success rate in
tracking the sources of outbreaks, and the associated publicity, probably
led to more testing and more reporting of outbreaks which may previously
have gone unreported. A lowered threshold of suspicion has led to
investigation of small clusters with successful results, as with Salmonella
typhimurium 43. All such successes add to our knowledge of the epidemiology
of this type of food-borne disease, and add to prospects for prevention.
[The above wording indicates that not all identified problems have been
corrected. One hopes that it is merely a transcription error. MHJ]
