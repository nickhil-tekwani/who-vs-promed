At least 3 cases of _E. coli_ [O157] have been traced to tainted meat
at a St. Helena Little League snack shack. In addition to 3 confirmed
cases, 2 other children exhibited the same symptoms for the same
length of time, and shared the Little League snack shack link, but
were not positively diagnosed for technical reasons, said Napa County
Public Health Officer Karen Smith. The 5 children, all St. Helena
Little League participants and 2 of them siblings, have since fully
recovered. One of them was hospitalized for a short time.
After it became clear that the 1st case, reported on 3 Apr 2007, was
not an isolated incident, county officials gathered the sick
children's recent food histories and found that they had all eaten
hamburger products at Little League snack shacks in St. Helena and
Calistoga, Smith said.
Meat samples from the Calistoga snack shack came back negative, but
St. Helena's tested positive for _E. coli_. Meat from the same lot at
Salami Lady's Cash and Carry, the Napa store that supplied St.
Helena's snack shack, also tested positive, Smith said.
The small outbreak has prompted the Merced-based Richwood Meat Co. to
recall about 100 000 pounds of beef.

The FDA has proposed new rules on the labeling of irradiated food,
permitting such foods to be labeled as pasteurized. While these
regulations would not cover ground beef, which is regulated by the
USDA, they will be an important step forward in the use of
irradiation to promote food safety. The rules (Document
FDA-2007-0189-0001) are open for public comment through 3 Jul 2007 at

[ProMED thanks Dr. Hull for his comments. The following is abstracted
from a Health Canada document "Irradiation of Ground Beef: Summary of
Submission Process"
<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/securit/irridation/gbeef_submission-soumission_viande_hachee05_e.html>.
It is important to note that irradiation of ground beef may produce
an off-odor but it appears to disappear upon cooking the meat:
"The relationship between odor production (smell) and dose is linear
up to 140 kGy. The odor is the result of the production of more than
100 volatile compounds, the principle components of which are
aliphatic hydrocarbons generated from fat breakdown. Protein-derived
compounds such as sulfur compounds and aromatic hydrocarbons make up
less than one percent of the total, and oxygenated compounds are also
relatively less abundant.
The use of chilling or freezing temperatures during the irradiation
process can greatly diminish the development of the irradiation
off-odor. Off-odors formed in meats packaged prior to irradiation,
were found to dissipate rapidly after exposure to the atmosphere for
several minutes. Samples irradiated at 6 kGy could be differentiated
from the controls but there was no significant difference in their
preference as rated on a scale from one (dislike extremely) to 9
(like extremely). Samples irradiated with 6 and 8 kGy were rated as
less acceptable than the controls. Increasing radiation dose appeared
to decrease the acceptability of the raw ground beef odor,
particularly over time, however the odor virtually disappears upon
cooking.
Although the stated primary objective of meat irradiation is pathogen
control, the delay of recognizable microbial spoilage of fresh and
pre-frozen-thawed raw meat is an "unavoidable" and concomitant
benefit of radiation pasteurization. Conclusions reached by various
researchers indicate that microorganisms are generally more radiation
sensitive in high fat ground beef and are less supportive of growth
of survivors than in low fat ground beef. Studies indicate that
spoilage is delayed by over a week at doses of approximately 1 kGy
and remained low after 21 days. A reduction in spoilage has been also
demonstrated in pork and lamb." - Mod.LL]
