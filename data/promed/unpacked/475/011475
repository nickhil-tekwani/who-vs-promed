The people in Volgograd started to worry after Rospotrebnadzor
[Territorial Directorate of the Federal Services for Consumer
Protection and Human Welfare] received a call on 17 Apr 2008 saying
that 2 persons had acquired anthrax in the region after slaughtering
a cow. An investigation is being carried out in this region and a
market was closed in Volgograd. Specialists do not confirm the risk
for infection but they are far from any conclusion.

The authorities announced that the information about the anthrax
cases was not confirmed. However, full disinfection was carried out
in the market. The meat trade resumed with low activity, as the
freezing facility will resume work after 27 Apr 2008. It is expected
that after it officials will clearly confirm or reject the case of outbreak.

[The most frequent scenario of anthrax infection in villages is
during the slaughter of sick animals. The market trade with meat
should be under strict veterinary control to prevent anthrax
contamination. In this case, the suspected contamination warranted
full disinfection of the market area. - Corr.VM

[As stated in the report, after 27 Apr 2008 the presence (or absence)
of anthrax cases in Volgograd should have become clear. As of 29 Apr
2008 no reports have been found on this matter. - Mod.NP]

For some reason the only reports of anthrax for Volgograd are in the
ProMED-mail postings (see below) and not in the OIE (World
Organisation for Animal Health) reports quoting Russian government
sources. As their reports are of the one case/one outbreak variety I
suspect it is because unless this diagnostic material reaches a key
laboratory, the data is not forwarded to Moscow. Obviously this
pathogen is persisting in Volgograd oblast, as in many others. As the
market underwent disinfection it would have logically followed the
display and sale of contaminated meat, if not the prior slaughter and
butchering of a sick animal, which in this instance had not been
properly inspected before slaughter as this chemical response
followed the report of human cases. We can therefore presume a
disinfection delay of a number of days, say 5 to 7 days, after the
butchering and sale. - Mod.MHJ]
