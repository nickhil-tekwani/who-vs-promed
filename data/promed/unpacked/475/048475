More than 10 000 pigs will be culled in Voronezh Oblast, Russia, due to an outbreak of African swine fever (ASF), according to a report by the deputy head of the regional department of agrarian policy, Oleg Lakhov.

The outbreak has been registered at a large farm, Nikolayvskay, in the south of the region. In total, the farm contains 50 000 pigs, while in the quarantine region there are about 40 000 heads. The representatives of the Russian veterinary service Rosselhoznadzor hope that the massive culling and burning of pigs will prevent the further spread of the disease.

"Infection has been revealed about 2 weeks ago when the mortality of pigs was determined. It turns out that, just like last year [2013], we were late with the diagnosis. Everyone has been talking about ASF being eliminated in Russia, but what kind of result can we see when the disease is walking freely in the country? While we do not have the national program to combat ASF, we cannot even dream about the elimination of ASF," commented Lakhov.

Voronezh Oblast is located just near Belgorod Oblast, where about 20 percent of the country's pig population is located.

[Oleg Lakhov's remarks adequately illuminate the unfortunate ASF situation in Russia. The extent of the virus spread there, throughout the European parts of Russia from south to north since end 2007, can be seen in the OIE interactive map at http://tinyurl.com/kzgaxzo (zoom in).

To see graphically ASF recent spread westwards (Poland, the Baltic countries), please refer to the map, produced and updated by the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI) in Germany, at http://www.fli.bund.de/fileadmin/dam_uploads/tierseuchen/ASP/Karten/Map_ASF-20140811-09-45.jpg (red dots: domestic pigs; blue dots: wild boar).

In the absence of a vaccine, stopping the march of the virus, in particular within the wild boar populations, seems to have become a rather Sisyphean mission.
