New York City is seeing an outbreak of a rare skin infection that comes from handling raw seafood, causing skin lesions, pain, and swelling to the hands and arms and even difficulty moving fingers, officials said.

Health officials are warning those who purchase raw fish and seafood at Chinatowns in Manhattan, Queens, or Brooklyn to wear waterproof gloves when handling those items, and to seek medical care if they discover red bumps on hands or arms.

The bacteria causing the infection are called _Mycobacterium marinum_ and they get into the body through a cut or other injury, the Health Department said. If the infection goes deep enough, surgery may be necessary.

Officials say 30 cases have been identified, and all of those report handling live or raw fish bought at markets in Manhattan, Brooklyn, or Queens.

The infections, which are treated with antibiotics, were reported to the Health Department by doctors, officials said. The Health Department said those who eat seafood from these markets are not at risk.

[The following has been mostly extracted from moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post Mycobacterium marinum, fish tank - USA: (CA) 20110704.2026, where references in the medical literature are available:

_Mycobacterium marinum_ is one of the non-tuberculous mycobacteria or NTM (that is, a grouping outside of the _M. tuberculosis_ complex). NTM are characterized by their rate of growth in vitro and pigment production. Organisms in the _Mycobacterium chelonae-abscessus_ group are non-pigmented and rapidly growing (RGM) NTM species, that is, produce mature growth on agar plates within 7 days of incubation.

Slow growers include _M. kansasii_, photochromogen, that is, its colonies produce a pigment when exposed to light, and _M. avium/intracellulare_ complex, a nonchromogen. _M. marinum_ is an intermediately growing NTM and a photochromogen.

_M. marinum_ infection occurs following skin and soft-tissue injuries that are exposed to an aquatic environment or fish. First described as "swimming-pool granuloma", when swimming pools were not routinely chlorinated, _M. marinum_ skin infections are now most often acquired from aquarium maintenance and called "fish tank granuloma". The infection usually presents as indolent, localized nodular or ulcerating skin lesions on mainly the upper limb of otherwise healthy people, but can evolve into an ascending lymphangitis that resembles sporotrichosis or can spread to deeper tissues, resulting in tenosynovitis, arthritis, and osteomyelitis.

Rifampin and ethambutol in combination has been reported to be the antibiotics used most often to treat _M. marinum_ infection. Other antibiotic options with reliable activity include clarithromycin, doxycycline, and minocycline. The duration of therapy is at least 3 months and is significantly longer for patients with deeper structure infections than for patients with infections limited to the skin and soft tissue. Most cases of invasive _M. marinum_ infection will also require surgical debridement as an adjunct to antimicrobial treatment. - Mod.ML
