Foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] has spread to Miyakonojo city, Japan's
largest producer of pork and beef, in the southern prefecture of
Miyazaki, threatening the nation's livestock industry and feed grain
demand.

The government confirmed the outbreak in a beef cattle farm in the
city, about 50 km [31 mi] from the eastern area of Miyazaki, where
most cases were discovered. All 208 animals in the farm were culled,
raising the total culled to about 158 600, said Atsushi Tachi at the
animal health division of the agriculture ministry.

"We are in a very serious, critical phase," prime minister Naoto Kan
was quoted by public broadcaster NHK as saying to government officials
today [10 Jun 2010]. "It is important to act quickly to prevent the
disease from spreading further."

FMD is one of the most contagious livestock diseases and can have high
mortality rates in young animals, according to the Paris-based World
Organization for Animal Health, or OIE. Miyazaki is Japan's
2nd-largest pig-farming region and 3rd-largest producer of beef cattle.

Miyakonojo city produced pork worth 22.5 billion yen (USD 247 million)
and beef cattle valued at 15.1 billion [USD 165 million] yen in 2006,
according to the latest data from the agriculture ministry. The city
had 376 100 pigs and 67 000 beef cattle in 2007, the latest ministry
data show.

"It is regrettable that the disease has expanded from the eastern part
of Miyazaki, regardless of our measures to contain it," Tachi at the
ministry said today [10 Jun 2010] by phone. "We are now checking how
the disease was transmitted."

The government plans to cull an additional 113 600 animals, including
uninfected ones, to prevent the disease from expanding further, Tachi
said.

Miyakonojo is also adjacent to Kagoshima prefecture, raising the risk
the disease may spread to Japan's largest farming region for pigs and
the 2nd-biggest for cattle.

Kagoshima had 1.34 million pigs and 376 200 beef cattle as of 1 Feb
2009, representing 14 percent of Japan's total swine herd and 13
percent of beef cattle.

The 1st case of the disease in Miyazaki was reported on 20 Apr 2010.
It was also the 1st outbreak of FMD in Japan since 2000.

Japan is in a situation where the disease may break out "anywhere,
anytime," agriculture minister Masahiko Yamada told reporters
yesterday [9 Jun 2010].

The country has so far discovered about 186 200 cases of the disease,
of which 152 871 were in pigs and the rest were mostly in [beef]
cattle and [dairy] cows, according to the ministry.

[The 279 1st cases (infected farms) so far, were restricted to
Miyazaki's Central area (yellow in the map at
<http://fc-miyazaki.com/english/access/index.html>);
the current cases are an extension of FMD into Miyazaki's West area
(pink), bordering the Kagoshima prefecture. Kagoshima is prefecture No
46 within Japan's Kiyushu & Okinawa region (gray) on Japan's
