Dr. Lausund quite correctly recalls the small outbreak of _Salmonella
oranienburg_ infection linked to black pepper in Norway in the early 1980s
(Gustavsen S, and Breen O. Investigation of an outbreak of _Salmonella
oranienburg_ infections in Norway, caused by contaminated black pepper. Am
J Epidemiol. 1984;119:806-12).

Early in our investigation we found that eating Italian food, often in
cafes, was a common feature of our cases. In the light of this evidence
(and the previous Norwegian work) we hypothesized that a condiment may well
have been the source of the infections in South Australia. The
case-control study we carried out gave an odds ratio for eating black
pepper of 2.33 [95% CI: 0.63 - 8.87 and for eating gelati an undefined
value (no controls ate gelati). _Salmonella oranienburg_ was isolated from
the gelati and confirmed these results.

We are continuing our investigation into the source of the contamination
into the gelati.
