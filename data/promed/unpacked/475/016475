Hong Kong battling with bird flu outbreak
-----------------------------------------
An outbreak of the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus in poultry in Hong Kong
food markets has led to the culling of live poultry across the city.
According to government officials the bird flu virus was detected at
a poultry stall in one of Hong Kong's numerous wet markets and as a
result 2700 birds were culled.

But the virus has now spread among the island's poultry population
and mass cullings have been conducted as a precaution to try to
control the spread of the virus. Officials say that all wet market
stores and fresh food stores selling live poultry are now infected
areas and all poultry will be culled, but poultry on local farms is
not said to be affected. Officials say mass the cullings are a
necessary precaution but no people have been infected and they are
trying to trace the source of the outbreak.

The outbreak of the virus, the 1st in Hong Kong wet markets in 5
years, has prompted Hong Kong authorities to suspend live poultry
imports from mainland China. This year there have been a number of
outbreaks of bird flu among migrating birds in the territory, which
are the suspected culprits in spreading the disease worldwide and it
was in Hong Kong that the world's 1st reported major bird flu
outbreak among humans occurred in 1997, which killed 6 people.

Since 2003 the lethal H5N1 strain has killed more than 240 people and
decimated poultry flocks around the world and the major concern is
that the virus will eventually mutate into a form that is easily
transmissible between humans, triggering a global pandemic.

China reports bird flu outbreak near HK border
----------------------------------------------
China on Tuesday [17 Jun 2008] reported a bird flu outbreak in ducks
in the southern province of Guangdong, close to Hong Kong where
poultry at all commercial markets was culled last week. The Guangdong
outbreak, in a village administered by Jiangmen city, was 1st
detected on 13 Jun 2008, the official Xinhua news agency said.

The National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory confirmed on
Tuesday that the virus the birds contracted was a subtype of the H5N1
strain, Xinhua quoted the Ministry of Agriculture as saying. A total
of 3873 ducks died of the disease and a further 17 127 were culled as
part of a contingency plan that the report said had effectively
contained the outbreak.

Large parts of densely populated Guangdong province, which provides
much of Hong Kong's poultry, have also been battling floods triggered
by downpours in the past week. Hong Kong banned poultry imports from
the Chinese mainland for 21 days since the 1st instance of the virus
was discovered there in early June 2008.

China reported its last bird flu outbreak in April in Tibet. It also
recorded an outbreak in March in Guangzhou, Guangdong's provincial
capital. With the world's biggest poultry population and hundreds of
millions of farmers raising birds in their backyards, China is seen
as crucial in the global fight against bird flu.

[China's last follow-up report on HPAI H5N1, No 13, was submitted to
the OIE on 7 Apr 2008 (OIE Ref: 6945). The report, including a map,
is accessible at:

The current discovery of outbreak(s) in Guandong was expected, in
view of the recent re-introduction of the virus into Hong Kong, where
an exemplary disease surveillance, prevention and control program has
been operational since 2003. - Mod.AS]

Bird flu outbreak was restricted
--------------------------------
An outbreak of bird flu in Oxfordshire was confined to a single
premise, a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)
report has concluded.

More than 25 000 chickens were culled after birds tested positive for
the H7 strain of the disease on Eastwood Farm, near Banbury on 3 Jun
2008. DEFRA's epidemiology report, published on Tuesday [17 Jun 2008]
says there was no evidence of infection in the protection zone.

However, investigations continue and the source is still being
examined. The report suggests the possiblity that the highly
pathogenic H7N7 avian influenza came from a low pathogenic strain
already present on the farm.

Nigel Gibbens, chief veterinary officer, said: "The UK is at a
constant but low level of risk of the introduction of avian influenza
and the report highlights the need for flock owners and poultry vets
to remain vigilant for signs of disease. I would encourage all
keepers to maintain good quality records and practise high standards
of biosecurity."

The 3km (1.8-mile) protection and 10km (6.2-mile) surveillance zones
remain in place. Further surveillance, testing and epidemiological
work on the outbreak are continuing.

Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H7N7, Oxfordshire, June 2008
Executive summary (11 Jun 2008, updated 16 Jun 2008)
-----------------------------------------------------
1. Following a report of suspected avian notifiable disease in laying
hens in Oxfordshire on 2 Jun 2008, highly pathogenic (HP) H7N7 avian
influenza (AI) infection was confirmed on 4 Jun 2008. At the time of
writing (11 June), 3 further reported cases, from across GB, have
been negated either on clinical grounds or after laboratory
examination of samples, and 3 are under investigation.

2. On 11 Jun 2008, it appears that the infection is confined to a
single premises. Infection has been ruled out at both premises of
origin of the affected birds. Investigations to date have found no
evidence of infection on any contact or geographically close
premises, and there has been no evidence of spread of infection to
any other premises to date, however investigations continue.

3. Clinical evidence, from the farm's records, supports virology
opinion that HPAI infection derived from a pre-existing Low
Pathogenic AI infection (LPAI). However the possibility of an HPAI
introduction has not been completely ruled out. Further analyses of
the virus and on the infected premises (IP) continue.

4. Seven hypotheses for source have been considered and the evidence
to date suggest 2 of these are much more likely than the others.

5. The 2 likely hypotheses for the source of the outbreak continue to
be investigated and are
i. Unidentified AI in domestic poultry premises in Great Britain,
associated either by proximity or potential contact, or
ii. AI in wildlife in contact with the IP

6. Movements of live domestic birds, which represent a medium to high
risk of transmission of AI, have been ruled out as a possible source
of infection for the IP, and as a potential means of spread of AI from the IP.

7. The network of contacts associated with the IP that might act as
the source of infection, or be at risk of spread of infection, is
made up in the main by the other premises connected to the large
commercial egg production business of which this farm was a part. The
main risk of exposure to AI virus was on premises associated with egg
collection routes, feed lorry deliveries, disposal of
carcasses/manure and personnel contacts.

8. Investigations to date indicate a good standard of biosecurity is
practiced in the chain between egg production and final packaging. At
the time of writing, investigations of premises at risk due to
potential contact (tracings) or proximity (within the protection
zone, PZ) have revealed no further infected premises. The absence of
positive findings from this line of inquiry seems to rule out
associated premises as the source of infection at the present time.
However further investigations including laboratory testing are in
progress on premises at risk, in case LPAI has been missed, as
clinical signs can be few and non-specific.

9. Wild bird activity in general was low around the IP. However
mallard ducks were introduced onto a pond near one of the mobile
sheds (shed 1) in 2007. Moreover, shed 1 was moved near to the pond,
a public footpath and a stream source immediately before the current
batch of 3000 birds were introduced. Current evidence suggests that
infection most likely started in Shed 1, and further investigations
in to the possibility of a wildlife source are in progress.

Update at 9am Mon 16 Jun 2008

10. Continuing investigations have found no further premises infected
with AI. The adjacent premises investigated as a report case were
negated based on laboratory results on 13 Jun 2008.

11. Five pigs were identified on the IP after this report was
compiled; they have been restricted and tested for infection with AI.
Examinations for both antibody and virus (by PCR) were negative.
Final confirmation of the absence of virus by virus isolation
methodology is in progress.

[The UK authorities submitted an immediate notification to the OIE on
the outbreak, and a follow-up report (No 1) which was submitted on 13
Jun 2008. Since the outbreak was regarded "continuing," weekly
follow-up reports may be expected, eventually terminated by a "final report."

On 13 Jun, a newswire on undiagnosed die-off of several swans, in
Caernarfon (north-west Wales) was posted ( 20080614.1880 ), with a
request for information on the outcome of tests allegedly carried
out. Results of the investigations -- expected to have ruled out
avian influenza -- will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
