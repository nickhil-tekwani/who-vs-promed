A 19 year old girl and an elderly woman of 64 died as a result of infection by H3N2 influenza virus, according to the Regional Health Service. According to the report of the institution, which declared a health emergency in the city of El Alto [La Paz Department], where the deaths occurred, these are the 1st 2 confirmed cases of influenza.

It also announced that an alert had been declared in the city to prevent spread of infection, since another patient with similar symptoms was under investigation.

In response to the emergency, the health authorities have ordered a supply of medicines and medical equipment to fight the disease, as well as safety measures and prevention in hospitals.

The H3N2 influenza virus has been spreading through South America for months, although Bolivia had not reported any cases previously. In the city of Arequipa [Arequipa Region], in neighboring Peru, at least 12 patients were recorded this week.

[It is evident from this report that the southern hemisphere seasonal influenza epidemic is now under way. It is surprising that the 1st 2 cases in Bolivia have had fatal outcomes and that the virus responsible is the A(H3N2) strain, not the A(H1N1) strain. Information on the availability and uptake of the southern hemisphere seasonal influenza vaccine in Bolivia would be welcomed.

The city of El Alto is in the western part of the country, right next to La Paz [Nuestra Senora de La Paz], which is the seat of government of Bolivia, as well as the departmental capital of the La Paz Department. El Alto has an elevation of roughly 4150 meters, making it one of the highest major cities in the world. - Mod.CP
