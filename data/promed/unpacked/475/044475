Researchers from the Pasteur Institute (France), the University of Sao Paulo and the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Brazil) have documented the case of a 38-year-old man who continued to test positive for coronavirus COVID-19 for at least 232 days. "Of the 38 cases we tracked, 2 men and one woman were atypical in that the virus was continuously detected in their body for more than 70 days," explains Marielton dos Passos Cunha, the 1st author of the article, which has been published in the scientific journal Frontiers of Medicine (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2021.760170/full).

This is not the 1st evidence that the virus can remain active for longer than expected even in patients with mild symptoms. In early 2021, other Brazilian researchers reported similar cases. They analyzed 29 samples of nasopharyngeal secretion from patients who tested positive for the COVID-19 test on the 10th day after the onset of symptoms and inoculated into cells grown in the laboratory. In 25% of cases, the viruses present in the samples were able to infect cells and replicate in vitro. Therefore, in theory, other people could become infected if they came into contact with the droplets of saliva expelled by 25% of these patients at the time of material collection.

The risk appears to be even greater for people with compromised immune systems. In an article published in June 2021, these same researchers described a case of infection that lasted at least 218 days. The patient was in his 40s and had undergone aggressive cancer treatment before contracting COVID-19.

Additionally, an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine in early December 2020 reported the case of a 45-year-old immunosuppressed man with an autoimmune blood disorder in which the virus continued to replicate for 143 days. And an article published in Cell in late December outlined the case for a leukemia patient in which the virus continued to replicate for at least 70 days, although there were no symptoms of COVID-19.

In this new study, the difference between women and men in the duration of viral activity was not significant (with a mean of 22 days and 33 days, respectively). As for the 3 atypical cases, the virus remained detectable for 71 days in the woman and 81 days in one of the 2 men. None of them had comorbidities and all had mild symptoms of COVID-19.

The other man continued to test positive for the coronavirus for 232 days (April to November 2020), after which he tested negative 3 times for PCR. He has had HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, since 2018 but has no detectable viral load thanks to antiretroviral therapy.

"Just because you're HIV positive doesn't mean you're more susceptible to other infections, because you've been on therapy since you were diagnosed. Its ability to respond to an infection by another agent is comparable to that of any other individual, and it did respond to the coronavirus when infected. It is not immunosuppressed, like cancer patients, people with autoimmune diseases or transplant recipients, for example," explains Paola Minoprio, one of the leaders of the work.

According to the researchers, his seropositive status does not explain the long duration of his coronavirus infection. It would be necessary to compare many patients infected simultaneously by the HIV and the SARS-CoV-2 with a suitable control group to see if any genetic or immune traits of the host could be associated with such prolonged viral excretion.

The patient underwent weekly tests that detected the persistence of the infection, and virus samples were periodically sequenced to show that this was not a case of reinfection and that the virus was not only continuing to replicate but was mutating.

The strategies used by the virus to escape the immune system during infection were traced, showing that the viral load decreased when there were more neutralizing antibodies, and that the virus was able to circumvent the body's defenses to re-accumulate the load. The cycle repeated itself, forcing the production of more antibodies until the viral load dropped again.

"It is important to observe patients like this because we can learn more about how the virus mutates and which mutations can lead to variants of concern," Cunha says. The study patient was infected by the lineage B.1.1.28, also called P1, which entered Brazil in early 2020. The researchers did not detect mutations in the virus isolated from the patient that could justify its classification as more transmissible or more resistant to the immune system.

[B] Argentina: high ICU occupancy
Date: Mon 31 Jan 2022
Source: La Brújula 24 [in Spanish, trans., edited]
https://www.labrujula24.com/notas/2022/01/31/se-disparo-la-ocupacion-en-las-terapias-por-covid-185-mas-en-enero-n189770/


Since December [2021] and after the entry of the omicron variant of the coronavirus, the 3rd wave of COVID-19 cases has been developing in Argentina. In January [2022], 25% of all cases diagnosed with the infection were registered since the start of the pandemic in March 2020.

This increase also implied a rise -- albeit slower -- in the occupation of beds in intensive care by patients who develop severe or critical symptoms due to the disease. In the week of 24 Jan 2022, the occupancy level of therapies returned to the levels of August of last year [2021], and there were already surgeries for other diseases that have been rescheduled.

In the week of 24 Jan 2022, daily intensive care admissions reached 2801 as a weekly average, a figure that exceeded that of last 30 Aug 2021. During January [2022], admissions for therapy grew by 185%.

"There was an increase in the occupancy of beds in hospitals due to this wave of the pandemic with the circulation of the omicron variant. But the increase in admissions of patients with COVID-19 would begin to be slower, "said Dr. Rosa Reina, former president of the Argentine Society of Intensive Care.

"In order to have beds for patients with COVID-19, scheduled surgeries are already being suspended in some hospitals in Córdoba, AMBA, and Santa Fe, among other jurisdictions," said Carina Balasini, a member of the Argentine Society of Intensive Therapy (SATI). "Obviously, oncological surgeries cannot be suspended because cancer does not wait," he added.

According to Dr. Reina, the occupation of beds also grew because "during the summer there is always (even before the pandemic) a greater demand for beds due to road accident injuries, among other causes."

Last year [2021], the 2nd great wave of the pandemic that hit Argentina took place between March and September. Most of the COVID-19 cases were affected by the gamma variant of the coronavirus. Meanwhile, starting in May, travelers with the delta variant of the coronavirus entered the country. But due to the limitations in the delta borders, it did not generate a great wave. In December, everything changed with the circulation of the omicron variant.

This new variant of concern detected in November [2021] in Africa caused an explosive rise in cases in the country. Meanwhile, the level of occupancy of beds in intensive care was slowly growing. As there is a vaccination rate applied in the general population, there were fewer severe cases than in previous waves. Most of the people now requiring hospitalization are usually not previously vaccinated.

The occupation of beds in intensive care had reached a minimum of 570 daily admissions in intensive care as a weekly average in the week of 15 Nov 2021. From then until 27 Dec 2021, the level of occupancy of beds in intensive care units increased by 43%. In January 2022, the rise was greater.

[2] Increasing COVID deaths
Date: Tue 1 Feb 2022
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/02/who-warns-rising-covid-19-deaths


The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) today [1 Feb 2022] said the group is tracking a worrying rise in deaths in most of the world's regions, urging countries not to give up in the battle against the more transmissible omicron (B.1.1.529) variant. In another development, the WHO today called attention to the burden COVID-19 medical waste is putting on health systems and suggested ways to safely and sustainably reduce and manage healthcare waste.

At a briefing today [1 Feb 2022], WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said since omicron was first detected 10 weeks ago, nearly 90 million more COVID-19 cases have been reported to the WHO, more than the total for 2020. In the wake of the avalanche of cases, officials are now tracking a very worrying rise in deaths, he said. "We're concerned that a narrative has taken hold in some countries that because of vaccines, and because of omicron's high transmissibility and lower severity, preventing transmission is no longer possible, and no longer necessary. Nothing could be further from the truth."

After today's briefing, Maria Van Kerkhove, PhD, the WHO's technical lead for COVID-19, said on Twitter that last week more than 63 337 people died from COVID-19. And though some may be ready to move on from the pandemic, those who have died and the families they left behind cannot, she added (https://twitter.com/mvankerkhove). "I know everyone wants to get back to 'normal,' but this level of intense circulation and death is not 'normal.' It's not a global situation that should be accepted nor tolerated when we have the tools to change the course of this pandemic," she said.

Tedros said the WHO isn't calling for more lockdowns, but it is urging countries to use all the measures they have to protect their populations without relying on vaccines alone. When asked about countries easing restrictions against the backdrop of ongoing surges, Mike Ryan, MD, who heads the WHO's health emergencies program, said every country is in a different situation. "You can look to the experience of others, but please don't just follow blindly what other countries are doing."

Tedros said the virus is dangerous and changing before the world's eyes and that the WHO is tracking 4 omicron sublineages, including the omicron BA.2 subvariant. He called on countries to step up their testing, surveillance, and sequencing. "We can't fight this virus if we don't know what it's doing."

More global headlines
---------------------
- Medical waste generated by the COVID-19 pandemic response is straining medical waste systems and posing threats to human and environmental health, the WHO said today [1 Feb 2022] in a new report. Much of the 87 000 tons of personal protective equipment (PPE) shipped to countries by United Nations agencies has likely ended up as waste, with test kits potentially contributing 2600 tons of noninfectious waste. Authors of the report made several recommendations, including using eco-friendly packaging and shipping and including reusable or recyclable PPE (https://www.who.int/news/item/01-02-2022-tonnes-of-covid-19-health-care-waste-expose-urgent-need-to-improve-waste-management-systems).

- The world has reached the milestone of putting 10 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses into people's arms in a little over a year, Nature reported yesterday [31 Jan 2022]. However, stark inequities remain, with only 5.5% of people in low-income countries having received 2 doses (https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00285-2).

- Denmark has now lifted all of its COVID-19 restrictions, including face masks in public places and on transport. The country is still experiencing a COVID-19 surge with the BA.2 omicron subvariant now dominant; however, more than 80% of the eligible population is vaccinated. Similarly, Norway today [1 Feb 2022] announced that it was ending most of its restrictions, saying that its spike in infections doesn't appear likely to stretch its health systems. The country also has high vaccine uptake, with about half having received a booster dose.

- The global total today [1 Feb 2022] rose to 380 432 276 million cases, along with 5 681 061 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins online dashboard (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/).

[3] At-home COVID test results
Date: Tue 1 Feb 2022
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/02/its-easy-misinterpret-home-covid-test-results-data-show


A randomized controlled trial [published] yesterday [31 Jan 2022] in JAMA Internal Medicine finds that adult consumers struggle to interpret and act on negative at-home COVID-19 tests (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2788656). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized 11 at-home, rapid antigen tests, including instructions, for asymptomatic and symptomatic Americans as of December 2021, and the Biden administration began distributing the first of a planned 500 million free such tests in January [2022].

While COVID-19 rapid antigen tests produce results within 30 minutes, they are less sensitive (have more false-negative results) than polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, which have an estimated sensitivity of about 70%, the study authors noted. Sensitivity is the probability that a test correctly identifies all positive cases.

"Therefore, users with a high pretest probability of disease should still quarantine even after receiving a negative test result," the researchers wrote. "If users ignore that probability, a negative test result may encourage behavior that is risky to them and others."

Steven Woloshin, MD, of the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, led the April 2021 trial, which involved asking 338 US adults how they would interpret the results of their self-test using instructions authorized by the FDA, instructions developed using decision science principles, or no instructions. The FDA-authorized test instructions were provided by the individual test makers.

In a JAMA audio interview, Woloshin said that when he was considering the study, he read the FDA-authorized instructions and thought they undermined users' intuition. "I thought the instructions were confusing and certainly weren't clear about what you should do if your test was negative, and they don't account for pretest probability at all," he said.

Participants were paid USD 5 and randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to a set of instructions and one of 4 risk scenarios, including 3 with a high pretest probability of infection (COVID-19 symptoms or close contact with someone who tested positive), and one with a low pretest probability (no symptoms or contact). Median age was 38 years, 46% were women, and 64% had at least a college degree.

Participants chose from 5 response options, ranging from "take no precautions" to "stay at home all the time, without exceptions, and avoid contact with others, including others in the household." The latter response was most closely aligned with US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for those with a positive COVID-19 test result or a negative result with a high pretest probability of infection.

Given a positive COVID-19 test result, 95% of participants appropriately isolated, regardless of the instructions they received. Participants given a negative result and a high-probability scenario were more likely to not quarantine appropriately using the FDA-authorized instructions (33%) than the design-science instructions (14%) or no instructions (24%).

Of participants given a low-probability scenario and negative results, 31% of those using FDA instructions quarantined unnecessarily, as did 22% of those using design-science instructions and 10% of those using no instructions. No comparison, however, was statistically significant (P = 0.05 and P = 0.20, respectively).

In a news release from the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Woloshin said that the findings suggest that many users will be mistakenly reassured by a negative test result (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/941873). "In other cases, they may quarantine unnecessarily because they misinterpret the implications of their test results," he said.

"Our results show how fundamentally important it is to design and pilot-test instructions to ensure that they can be understood by as many users as possible -- to increase the benefits and reduce the harms from at-home self-test kits." An untested public health message can be as dangerous as an untested drug, Woloshin said in the interview. "Otherwise, it undermines the whole point of [COVID-19] testing."

[4] Africa: children

https://www.nature.com/articles/d44148-022-00013-y


A new study spanning Africa suggests that young people hospitalized with COVID-19 are at much greater risk of long-term illness or death than those elsewhere. Published in Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Pediatrics, the research team, from the African Forum for Research and Education in Health (AFREhealth) COVID-19 Research Collaboration on Children and Adolescents, analysed data from 469 children and adolescents aged 0-19 years with SARS-CoV-2 infection in 25 hospitals. They found 35% of hospitalized children and adolescents were admitted to the intensive care unit or needed oxygen, and 21% of those admitted to the ICU required invasive ventilation. The mortality rate was about 8%.

"African children with COVID-19 are sicker when hospitalized, than children in high-income countries, and also do poorly because they don't have access to life saving interventions," said Jean Nachega, a co-author and professor of medicine at Stellenbosch University, Cape Town, South Africa. The study revealed a greater likelihood of more severe outcomes of COVID-19 among infants under one year and those with non-communicable disease co-morbidities, including hypertension, chronic lung diseases and blood disorders.

Nadia Sam-Agudu, co-author and pediatric infectious disease specialist, from the Institute of Human Virology, in Abuja, Nigeria, said: "African countries that are yet to give vaccine approval for children should consider approving the vaccines."

Given the adverse outcome of infection, it is critical that children and adolescents in Sub-Saharan African countries have access to vaccines, so they are able to get vaccinated. - Mod.LK]

A global total of 13 932 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 30 Jan 2022 to late 31 Jan 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last few weeks can be attributed to the rapid spread of the omicron variant globally. The 7-day averages indicate an increasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 93 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 50 of the 93 countries are from the European region, 13 are from the Americas region, 15 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 5 from the South-East Asia region, and 4 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 5.1%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 16.9%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 21.0% decrease in daily reported cases and a 9.3% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily report counted over 4.27 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 382.174 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.70 million reported deaths. Transmission continues at a very high level. - Mod.UBA]
