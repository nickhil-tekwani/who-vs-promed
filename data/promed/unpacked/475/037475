The Colorado Department of Agriculture (CDA) announced on 29 Apr 2013 that a horse in Garfield County tested positive for equine infectious anemia (EIA).

The CDA said that the herd mates of the affected horse have tested negative to EIA and neighboring horses will be tested to rule out any spread by insect vector. "Identifying infected horses and restricting their contact with susceptible animals is the key to preventing the spread of this disease," said state veterinarian Keith Roehr. "EIA is transmitted through biting flies; the most common would be deer and horse flies. Horse owners can protect their herd by control biting flies around the stable and other areas where horses are kept."

EIA is an equid disease that can cause fever, anemia, fluid accumulation on the chest or legs, and emaciation in some animals. The virus can also cross the placental barrier to cause fetal infection. Many horses do not show any clinical signs of disease or have very mild signs on 1st exposure and carry the virus subclinically. All infected horses, including those that are asymptomatic, are potential carriers and are considered infectious for life.

Infected animals must either be destroyed or remain permanently isolated from other equids to prevent transmission. There is currently no vaccine to protect a horse against EIA.

A blood test to detect the disease is called a Coggins test, and it is required for equids entering Colorado and is recommended for all horses that change ownership or attend equine events.

[Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is a contagious, viral disease affecting all members of the equine species, including horses, ponies, donkeys, and mules. Once animals become infected, they are life-long carriers of the virus.

There are 3 clinical forms of EIA: acute, chronic, and inapparent. The majority of the clinical signs of the disease are related to the reaction of the animal's immune system to the viral infection.

Clinical signs of the acute form include high fever, depression, loss of appetite, small areas of hemorrhaging on the mucous membranes, stocking up (swelling of the legs), and edema (collection of fluid) along the ventral abdomen. Clinical signs of the acute form of the virus usually appear 7 to 30 days after exposure to (or infection with) the virus.

Clinical signs of the chronic form of EIA include reoccurring intermittent fever, depression, lack or loss of appetite, weight loss, anemia, weakness, and incoordination of the hind legs. The severity and frequency of the reoccurring episodes decrease over time. Animals that are infected without showing detectable clinical signs are "inapparent carriers" of EIA. Mares that are infected with EIA typically fail to conceive or abort if they are pregnant.

EIA is found in the blood of all infected animals even if they are inapparent carriers. Typically, equines with the acute form of the disease are more infectious than others carrying the virus because of the high levels of virus circulating in the blood. The primary method of transmission is through blood sucking insects, including horse flies, deer flies, mosquitoes, and gnats. Less common modes of transmission are virally contaminated instruments such as needles, syringes, and dental and teeth floating equipment. Transmission may also occur between infected pregnant mares and unborn foals. About 10 per cent of foals born to infected mares are infected with the virus. The virus may also be transmitted through natural service or breeding.

There are several preventative management measures equine owners can take to decrease the risk of their animals contacting the disease. One important measure is the establishment of an effective fly control program. Blood sucking insects are the primary transmitters of EIA, so decreasing the presence of these pests can decrease the risk of equine animals getting the disease. Effective fly control programs can include foggers, fly repellants, and electronic or automatic fly control systems in barns. Perhaps the easiest and most cost effective method of fly control is the removal and spreading of manure and generally keeping barns and other areas clean.

Another preventative measure is sterilizing and disinfecting all animal health equipment. Use syringes and needles on only one animal. Follow the rule of thumb: "One horse, one syringe, one needle." Be sure that surgical, dental, and tattooing equipment is sterilized and disinfected after each use.

Require all equines entering the premises to have a negative EIA test within the past 12 months and test all horses annually for EIA.

It is imperative to remember that infected animals are lifelong carriers of EIA. Currently, there are no effective treatments for the disease. Likewise, there are no vaccines available in North America for prevention or protection from EIA.

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has thoughtfully provided educational material to owners, to state authorities, and to all of us. There is an educational brochure on EIA at the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service page at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/animal_diseases/eia/downloads/eia-1996.pdf.
