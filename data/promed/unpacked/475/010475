Ryegrass toxicity fears in SA
---------------------------
Livestock producers in South Australia fear a burst of hot weather will
worsen outbreaks of ryegrass toxicity, which can kill sheep, cattle and
horses.
The DPI [Department of Primary Industries] says there have been up to
16 cases of stock deaths on the Yorke and Eyre Peninsulas, including
100 sheep on one property, and 40 cattle on another.
Livestock advisor Brian Ashton says farmers need to keep a close eye
on their stock, especially with today's forecast for 40 degree C
temperatures.
"It's a toxin that affects the nervous system of the animal ... so that any
stress on the animal will make it worse. In fact if you go out to a mob
and you're not stirring them up they just look quite normal. But when
you make them run, and you stress them a little bit; then that's when you
see them falling over, trying to "climb stairs" and all the classic signs."

[The type of cultivar of ryegrass allows for mycotoxins to be produced
by the endophyte which infects the plant. _Acremonium loliae_ is the
fungus that infects perennial ryegrass. The endophyte [in Australia]
affects the leaf, stem, and the seed head. In contrast, the endophyte in
the US affects [only] the seed head.
Managment to prevent the disease includes planting cultivars that are not
susceptible to the mycotoxins, and moving animals such that plants are
not grazed closely to the ground. This type of grazing may still present
some cases, but grazing the grasses close to the ground seems to increase
the incidence. Pastures that are older than 2 years old from planting may
have less difficulty. The mycotoxin is generally short-lived, about 18-
24 months in most cases.
Generally in Australia, ryegrass staggers is a neurological disease
affecting sheep and cattle. Clinical signs usually develop approximately
a week or 2 after animals begin grazing infected pastures.
Ryegrass staggers in Austraila has been documented to affect sheep,
cattle and horses. Deer are thought to be succeptible but goats have not
been reported as being susceptible.
Clinical signs in affected sheep may include trembling, staggering,
swaying when prompted to move. These animals may be easily excited,
and demostrate a stiff, tilted gait with muscle twitching and even
convulsions. Cattle may present with a trunk stiffness leading to
difficulty in walking. They may be seen in unusual positions, such as
kneeling with the front legs but not the back legs, or sitting, much like
a dog sits. When cattle collapse, they do so with legs in a flexed
positions, where as other diseases produce rigidly extended legs.
Horses stand with splayed legs & are easily excited by noise or
movement. They are hypersensitive to most stimuli. They move slowly,
in a drunken fashion, and fall easily. Horses [may] also develop a
paralysis of the hindquarters.
If pastures contain a high proportion of non-infected plants, and
animals are not severely affected, & may recover, [but] if the pastures
are predominately affected by the endophyte and the animals are not
removed from the pastures, then permenant neurological damage may
occur. [Apart from] pasture mangement, treatment is symptomatic and
may be unrewarding as the neurological damage may be permanent.-
