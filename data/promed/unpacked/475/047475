Equine parvovirus-hepatitis virus (EqPV-H), which can cause liver disease in horses, can be transmitted nasally, researchers have found. They said the long time between infection and the detection of the virus in the blood suggests biosecurity measures to control its spread could be impractical.

EqPV-H was recently identified as an important cause of viral hepatitis in horses. Experimental infection studies show the virus commonly causes subclinical to mild clinical hepatitis. It has also been associated with Theiler's disease, also known as acute hepatic necrosis.

EqPV-H infections and Theiler's disease, which is often fatal, commonly occur after treatment with equine origin biologic products, such as tetanus antitoxin, botulinum antitoxin, or others.

The incubation period to detectable virus in the blood is on average between 1 and 6 weeks after such transmission. The onset of subclinical or clinical hepatitis usually ranges between 4 and 10 weeks after administration of an equine-sourced biologic, although it can be as long as 14 weeks.

However, many cases of EqPV-H infection and Theiler's disease occur without a history of treatment with an equine origin biologic product, Joy Tomlinson and Gerlinde Van de Walle noted in the Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine.

The pair, with the College of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, said the disease can occur as outbreaks on individual farms, suggesting alternative natural routes of horizontal transmission are likely.

The virus is widely distributed in horses around the world, they noted, with viremia -- the presence of the virus in the blood -- ranging in studies between 4% and 20% and a seroprevalence of 15% to 35%, indicating evidence of previous exposure.

On premises where at least one horse has developed Theiler's disease, over half of in-contact horses typically are infected, suggesting efficient horizontal transmission.

Tomlinson and Van de Walle said insects have been proposed as a cause of the spread, given that spontaneous cases of Theiler's disease show a seasonal distribution in the summer to autumn and the fact that other blood-borne viruses of horses are mechanically transmitted by biting flies.

The pair said their recent attempt at experimental transmission via horse fly bites was unsuccessful, but this does not rule out biting fly transmission because of the limited number of bites used per horse in that study.

Transmission by inhalation or ingestion also has been proposed, they said, based on the fact these are common transmission routes for many parvoviruses. Additionally, the researchers recently found that EqPV-H is shed intermittently via oral, nasal, and fecal secretions for at least 10 weeks after experimental intravenous inoculation.

In their latest study, the researchers set out to investigate the oral and nasal inoculations with EqPV-H in horses to evaluate transmission efficiency by these routes.

"Indeed, transmission by inhalation or ingestion more easily would explain the widespread distribution and high prevalence of EqPV-H among horses when compared to mechanical insect vectoring, which would be more restricted in seasonality and geography."

Eleven horses, aged 3 to 14 [years] and all negative for EqPV-H, were first inoculated with the virus by mouth. None of them showed evidence of the virus in their blood or had seroconverted after 8 weeks, based on molecular-based testing.

The horses were then inoculated via the nose. Five of the horses showed evidence of the virus in their blood within 6 to 12 weeks of exposure via the nose and seroconverted within 10 to 19 weeks.

After a period without monitoring from 12 to 19 weeks post-inoculation, another 5 horses were found to have the virus in their blood at 19 to 22 weeks. "The 2nd set of 5 horses could have been infected by horizontal transmission from the 1st set of 5 because of cohousing," they said.

The authors said their study expands understanding of the transmission modes of EqPV-H. "In summary," they said, "we can only conclude 5 horses were infected by the experimental inoculation, and the route of infection for the remaining 5 horses is undetermined, but likely represents natural horizontal transmission, emphasizing the efficiency of transmission within a herd."

The authors said the successful transmission of a virus with experimental inoculations, as performed here, does not always correspond to efficient transmission in nature. It remains unclear what viral doses horses are exposed to in nature, as well as the required minimum infectious dose of EqPV-H for a horse to become naturally infected.

"Additionally, spontaneous cases of Theiler's disease (the severe outcome of EqPV-H infection) show a seasonal distribution in the summer to fall. Whether this observation indicates seasonal transmission which is restricted to spring and summer based on the presence of insects, or whether other seasonal factors contribute to this severe manifestation of disease remains unknown.

"Given that parvoviruses are not known to be biologically vectored by insects, insect transmission would have to be mechanical either by face and house flies transferring externally shed virus or by biting flies, such as horse and stable flies, transferring blood."

Tomlinson and Gerlinde Van de Walle said their finding that transmission could occur by nasal exposure has important implications for biosecurity and vaccine design. Ideally, isolation of EqPV-H-infected individuals could be used to prevent transmission on a property.

"However, doing so presents multiple challenges. First, EqPV-H shedding has been documented for at least 10 weeks after acute infection. Second, horses can be chronically infected for years, and shedding during chronic infection has not yet been evaluated.

"Third, our study demonstrated a prolonged incubation period of up to 12 weeks before detectable viremia. Thus, both isolation of infected horses and monitoring of in-contact horses would require separation and repeated sampling, respectively, for many weeks or months."

Vaccination provides an attractive alternative when an effective biosecurity approach to limit viral spread is impractical, they said.

"Because many effective vaccines are available for various parvoviruses, it appears feasible also to develop an effective vaccine for EqPV-H.

"Based on our findings of transmission via nasal mucosal surfaces, we propose a vaccine inducing robust local immunoglobulin A responses in the nose could be highly effective."

Abstract
--------
Background: Equine parvovirus hepatitis (EqPV-H) is highly prevalent and causes subclinical to fatal hepatitis, which can occur in outbreaks. Whereas iatrogenic transmission is well documented, the mode of horizontal transmission is not known. The virus is shed in nasal, oral and fecal secretions, and PO [per os; i.e., by mouth] transmission has been reported in a single horse.

Hypothesis/objective: Investigate the efficiency of PO and nasal transmission of EqPV-H in a larger cohort.

Methods: Prospective experimental transmission study. Eleven EqPV-H-negative horses were inoculated with 5 x 10exp6 genome equivalents EqPV-H. Serum PCR and serology for EqPV-H were performed weekly and monthly, respectively. Horses first were inoculated PO and then intranasally 8 weeks later.

Results: No horse became viremic or seroconverted within 8 weeks after PO inoculation. After intranasal inoculation, 5 horses became viremic within 6-12 weeks and seroconverted within 10-19 weeks. After a period without monitoring from 12-19 weeks postinoculation, another 5 horses were found to be viremic at 19-22 weeks. The 2nd set of 5 horses could have been infected by horizontal transmission from the 1st set of 5 because of cohousing.

Conclusions and clinical importance: We demonstrated EqPV-H can be transmitted nasally. The prolonged eclipse phase before detectable viremia indicates biosecurity measures to control spread could be impractical.

[A very interesting study that may help understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease and provide better testing and, we hope, a better method of treatment at some point.

Please also compare with the AAEP (American Association of Equine Practitioners) 25 Mar 2021 Equine Parvovirus-Hepatitis Virus Guidelines (https://aaep.org/news/aaep-publishes-equine-parvovirus-hepatitis-virus-guidelines):

"The American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) has published on its website comprehensive guidelines to educate practitioners about transmission, risk factors, clinical signs and other considerations pertaining to equine parvovirus-hepatitis virus (EqPV-H), a recently discovered virus capable of causing hepatitis in infected horses.

"Two distinct etiologies of EqPV-H infection are recognized: biologic transmission and non-biologic transmission. Asymptomatic infection is common; only a small percentage of infected horses will develop clinical signs of liver disease.

"'Drs. Thomas Divers and Bud Tennant of Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine discovered that this novel parvovirus was associated with the disease "serum sickness" in horses who had recently been administered a parvovirus-infected biologic,' said guidelines co-author Dr. Piper Norton. 'Because of their seminal research and active ongoing research, information will be learned about this virus that will assist in making biologics safer for use in horses and help with diagnosis and treatment of this disease.'

"EqPV-H is a recently discovered virus and the focus of rapidly evolving research. These guidelines reflect knowledge at the time of writing. Practitioners are encouraged to seek further consultation for questions regarding clinical cases of EqPV-H.

"The Equine Parvovirus-Hepatitis Virus Guidelines were authored by Linda Mittel, MSPH, DVM; Piper Norton, DVM, DACVIM; Joy Tomlinson, DVM, DACVIM; and Thomas Divers, DVM, DACVIM, DACVECC. The guidelines were reviewed and approved by the AAEP's Infectious Disease Committee and board of directors.
