Re: ProMED-mail Avian influenza (25): Netherlands, turkey, LPAI H5N2 20120318.1073991
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
In response to the RFI above, we can provide the following information:

The outbreak in turkeys is caused by an avian influenza (AI) virus of subtype H5N2. Part of the haemagglutinin was sequenced. The sequence at the HA cleavage site was RETR.GLF (accession number EPI358505). This sequence motive confirms that the infection is caused by a low pathogenic avian influenza virus.

The infection was detected when serum samples scored positive in the haemagglutination inhibition test on H5 antigen. In the Netherlands all poultry farms are tested routinely at least once a year for antibodies against AI virus. The H5 virus was detected in trachea and cloacal swabs that were collected by the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority as the follow-up of the serology results.
