One person died, and 9 others fell sick after consuming a spurious toddy drink in Dhar district on Sat 13 Feb 2021.

The incident was reported at Kudadipura village in Kukshi tehsil. Block medical officer Dr Abhishek Rawat at Kukshi health centre said that 10 villagers including 3 minors were admitted here after they complained of vomiting and diarrhea after consuming a toddy at their village.

The doctors started their treatment at the health centre. But, as the condition of 7 villagers deteriorated, the doctors referred them to Barwani district hospital. One person died on the way to Barwani. The condition of those admitted at the hospital are said to be stable.

The victims said that they detected a difference in the taste of the toddy, and later, they started feeling giddiness and collapsed, while some others suffered fits. They were immediately shifted to the local health center.

[The timing of the illness after ingesting the drink is not clear, but it is more likely that the illness was called by a chemical toxin or poison rather than anything from a microbiological contamination.
