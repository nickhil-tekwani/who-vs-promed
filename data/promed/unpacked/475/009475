re: school pertussis outbreak in the UK
---------------------------------------
This public health outbreak response creates an opportunity for a natural
experiment in the sensitivity of the culture for _B. pertussis_ bacteria.
The culture is said to be notoriously inaccurate in routine clinical use.
Sometimes the poor results are blamed on less-than-ideal handling/shipping
conditions, or on the (presumed) fastidiousness of the organism. In this
setting, where we can assume a high proportion of actual infections, the
number of culture positives achieved will be interesting. I hope we hear
from public health authorities what the aggregate test results are. In some
pediatric settings in the US, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are
being used instead of cultures. One pediatric hospital in Fort Worth, Texas
has switched over to PCR entirely. The jury is still out on whether these
are more sensitive and specific, although I have heard the Fort Worth
hospital is happy with the change.

[Although culture of _B. pertussis_ on specific media has been considered
to be the gold standard for diagnosis, its sensitivity is limited,
particularly if the patient has received antimicrobial therapy. In
addition, even if positive, the results take 5 to 7 days, as this Gram
negative bacillus is slow-growing. Dr Walsh points out that PCR can be a
more rapid and more sensitive alternative to diagnosis.
As an example, using TaqMan PCR technology, a recent report from the
Provincial Laboratory in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada (1) found the
following in comparing PCR and culture:
Parameter / PCR (percentage) / culture (percentage)
Sensitivity / 100 / 11.6
Specificity / 97.4 / 100
Positive predictive value / 87.6 / 100
Negative predictive value / 100 / 85.7
Average time for positive test / 2.3 days / 5.1 days
That PCR can be useful in diagnosis of pertussis even while on treatment
was shown by Edelman, et al. (2): PCR was positive for as long as 7 days
after therapy was begun and the culture was no longer positive. This
technology, especially with the use of multiple primers, may speed the
diagnosis and therefore the control of this infection.
