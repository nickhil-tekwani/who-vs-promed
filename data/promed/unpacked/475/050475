An unauthorized cheese factory in the northern Portuguese town of Baiao, 370 km north of Lisbon, is the source of an outbreak of brucellosis in the area, which has so far led to 13 confirmed infections, according to local press reports on Tuesday [25 Nov 2014].

Brucellosis, which is also known as Malta fever, rock fever or Mediterranean fever, is most often contracted from unpasteurized milk or milk products such as cheese. The disease leads to parasites [bacteria] in the host's bloodstream, and episodes may last weeks, months or even years. It causes potentially recurrent episodes of high fever, sweating and related anemia.

At least 4 of the victims of the outbreak have been hospitalized in the neighboring city of Porto, a spokesperson from the Northern Regional Health Administration told the Expresso newspaper.

Local authorities in the Porto municipality of Baiao said the source of the brucellosis outbreak was cheese from a home-based factory, adding that the infection had been contained.

"The cases of brucellosis originated from consumption of cheese produced in an artisan fashion. The place and period when they were consumed has been identified," a local government spokesperson said.

[According to OIE data, both _Brucella abortus_ and _B. melitensis_ are present in Portugal. _B. abortus_ is related (almost) exclusively to bovines, while _B, melitensis_, generally related to small ruminants (sheep & goats), has been shown to occasionally infect cattle as well, without clinical signs but readily causing the excretion of large quantities of the bacterium in milk, becoming a serious public health hazard. This mostly happens when cattle are exposed to aborting sheep or goats.

The report does not specify the pathogen involved, nor the animal species from which the milk for the incriminated cheese production was derived. Pasteurisation of the milk prior to its processing would have prevented brucella contamination of the final product (cheese), even if sourced from infected flocks. However, certain sheep cheeses are traditionally produced from raw, un-pastuerised milk. In such cases, the cheese should undergo pasteurisation after its processing and prior to marketing.

Portugal is one of the few EU member states still infected with _B. melitensis_, similar to Spain, Greece and Italy. The following OIE data on _B. melitensis_ in Portugal pertain to the recent 5 years 2009-2013:

Year / Outbreaks in animals / Human cases / Rate per 100 000 population
2009 / 126 / 81 / 0.7666
2010 / 91 / 86 / 0.8139
2011 / 436* / 85 / 0.8045
2012 / 133 / 47 / 0.4448
2013 / 91 / 35 / 0.3312

The general trend observed in Portugal during the 5 years seems to indicate a gradual decrease in the number of outbreaks in animals (sheep/goats) and in the number of human cases (*the striking increase in number of animal outbreaks as reported for 2011 is in need of explanation/clarification).

Brucellosis in humans yields low fatality rates but causes substantial host disability. Despite estimates of more than 500 000 new human cases annually throughout the world, brucellosis remains frequently under-diagnosed and neglected amongst livestock diseases in many endemic countries. - Mod.AS]

[Brucellosis in humans causes malaise, fever, chills, sweats, headache, neck pain, low back pain, joint pain, muscle pain, occasionally diarrhea, constipation, anorexia, weight loss, abdominal pain, weakness, irritability, insomnia, and depression. Brucellosis has been called undulating fever because of its habit of producing fever and signs that wax and wane over an extended period of time." - Mod.LL
