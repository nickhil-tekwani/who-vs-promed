A California company has recalled several brands of soft cheeses after they were linked to 24 illnesses around the country and 1 death in Ohio.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] says that Karoun Dairies, Inc. has voluntarily recalled and stopped production of several cheeses, including those sold under the brand names Karoun, Arz, Gopi, Queso Del Valle, Central Valley Creamery and Yanni.

The CDC said that 5 of the illnesses were in pregnant women, and one resulted in a fetal loss. 14 of the _Listeria_ illnesses were in California. The other illnesses were in Ohio, Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Tennessee and Washington.

_Listeria_ generally only affects the elderly, people with compromised immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborn infants.
