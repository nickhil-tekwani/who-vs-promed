RABIES, POST-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS
=================================
I am a large animal veterinarian working in SE Asia. Recently, we
handled a bovine case that eventually became a rabies suspect, due to
clinical signs exhibited by the animal. Initially, due to the
possibility of the animal having FMD, the oral cavity was examined. All
vets and students wore gloves. However, large amounts of saliva were
aerosolized and some people received droplets intraocularly.

Rabies prophylaxis (Rhone-Merieux, inactivated human vaccine)
was started in four people on day 2 following contact. The animal died
on day 1 and a post-mortem examination was done on day 2. Post-mortem
findings suggest cerebral babesiosis. Fluorescent antibody test for
rabies has been reported to me first as positive, and then as negative.

This is a somewhat disconcerting situation. Histopathology and
suckling mice test results are still pending. This is now day 9 post
contact. One of the four people, a veterinarian, has received a rabies
vaccination series while a student in 1988, and presumably developed an
adequate titer to participate in clinics as a student in the U.S. The
other three have not previously been vaccinated for rabies. Currently
the four people involved are being very strongly advised to complete a
five shot series, while at the same time being assured that the cow is
really negative.
Several people have reported that WHO recommendations, under the
normal(non-exposed) situation are for three shots on day0, day7, and
day28 in naive individuals receiving vaccine for the first time. As far
as I know, the five-shot series is reserved for post-exposure
prophylaxis and is often used along with rabies immune globulin.

My question is, are there ever any serious contraindications for
taking a five-shot human rabies vaccine series in either naive patients
or in previously vaccinated patients? (Titers are not available here.)
Several conflicting answers have been given here and I would
like some more advice.
