The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) is currently supporting the Delta and Enugu State Governments in response to a suspected outbreak of yellow fever. This is following reports of a sudden spike in cases and deaths in some communities in both states.

On 2 and 3 Nov 2020, NCDC was notified by the State Ministries of Health of Delta and Enugu States, respectively of cases presenting with symptoms indicative of a viral haemorrhagic fever. Most cases presented with fever, headache, fatigue, jaundice vomiting (with or without blood) among others.

As at 6 Nov 2020, 3 samples from Delta and one sample from Enugu tested positive for yellow fever at Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital Laboratory and NCDC's National Reference Laboratory, Gaduwa. More samples are being tested from both states to confirm the causative organism of this outbreak.

The State Epidemiology Teams are leading the response with support from NCDC, National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), and the World Health Organization (WHO). An incident management system has been activated by NCDC to coordinate response activities, and Rapid Response Teams (RRT) have been deployed to both states. The NCDC and State RRTs are carrying out active case searches, risk communications, and community engagement, as well as ensuring prompt management of cases. Our sister agency, NPHCDA, is working with the affected states to plan for a vaccination campaign.

Yellow fever is a vaccine-preventable disease, and a single shot provides immunity for a lifetime. Symptoms of the disease include yellowness of the eyes, sudden fever, headache and body pain. The yellow fever vaccine is available for free in primary health care centres in Nigeria as part of the national childhood routine immunisation schedule. The yellow fever virus is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito.

The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) advises the public to take the following precautionary measures to reduce the risk of yellow fever infection:

- Keep your environment clean and free of stagnant water to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes.

- Use insecticide-treated mosquito nets and install screens on windows and doors to prevent mosquito bites.

- Healthcare workers are reminded to maintain a high index of suspicion for yellow fever amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

- Please ensure your child is vaccinated against yellow fever as part of the national childhood routine immunisation schedule. If you are unsure of your immunisation status, please visit a health facility to receive a yellow fever vaccine.

Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease caused by the yellow fever virus (arbovirus), which continues to cause severe morbidity and mortality in Nigeria. Following the strengthening of surveillance systems in Nigeria, a case of yellow fever was reported on 12 Sep 2017, 21 years after the last confirmed case. Since then, we have continued to confirm cases and clusters in Nigeria, while NPHCDA continues to deliver proactive and reactive vaccination campaigns in response. Nigeria is implementing WHO's "EYE-Strategy," to eliminate yellow-fever epidemics.

The NCDC will continue working with the affected states, other government agencies, and our partners to reduce the risk of spread of the disease and ensure cases are well managed to reduce the number of deaths.

The Delta State government has conducted some tests to ascertain the mysterious deaths recorded in Ute-Okpu and Idumesa communities in Ika North East Local Government Area of the state.

According to the Commissioner for Health in the state, Dr Mordi Ononye, the results of the tests carried out have come back positive for yellow fever disease.

He made the disclosure on Friday [6 Nov 2020] while briefing reporters in Asaba, the state capital.

Dr Ononye confirmed that as of noon on Friday [6 Nov 2020], 22 deaths have been recorded with 7 active cases receiving treatments in hospitals across the state.

He, however, noted that the state health authorities await authentication of the government's position from the Regional Test Centre in Dakar, Senegal within a period of one month.

[An earlier report indicated that over 15 persons within the 18 to 25 years age bracket died of an undiagnosed illness in the past 2 weeks in Delta state (see Undiagnosed deaths - Nigeria (03): (DE) RFI 20201102.7911072). The above report indicates there were 22 cases and that 3 tests from Delta state and one from Enugu state were positive for yellow fever (YF). There are no indications that the YF-positive individuals had not been vaccinated against YF.

It will be interesting to learn whether the epidemiological efforts reveal additional cases in either state and what proportion of the populations in the affected areas had been vaccinated against YF in the past. Because of recent YF outbreaks in Nigeria, yellow fever preventive mass vaccination (PMVC) campaigns are planned for implementation in Oyo, Delta, Benue, Osun, Bauchi, and Borno States in the 3rd and 4th quarters of 2020 (see Yellow fever - Africa (05): Nigeria 20200217.6998674). It would be of interest to know whether those plans have been implemented. - Mod.TY
