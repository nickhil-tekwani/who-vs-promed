Outbreak of visceral Leishmaniasis in Unity State, South Sudan
--------------------------------------------------------------
Unity State health officials and the World Health Organization are struggling to contain an outbreak of Kala azar, a disease spread by sand-fly bites, in Koch County, 90 kilometres south of the state capital Bentiu.

Dr. Santino John Tabang, Director general of the Health Ministry in Unity State, informed on 5 Sep 2012 that since 1 Sep [2012], nearly 200 people are believed to have contracted Kala azar, with 84 being treated in Koch County Hospital for the potentially fatal disease that has already killed one person.

There was a previous Kala azar outbreak in Unity State in late 1980 during the civil war between Khartoum and former rebels who now govern the independent Republic of South Sudan.

South Sudan's largest state, Jonglei, normally has the most Kala azar cases. After the current outbreak, Unity State is now ranked second. Authorities are concerned about the spread of the disease, transmitted by sand-flies which live in bushy acacia trees which are common in South Sudan. The World Health Organization has transported drugs to Koch County to help treat victims but there are a lack nurses and ward space to cope with the number of patients.

Unity State health officials say they are working to put up more tents. "We can't say if the cases are still on the rise, so the capacity will be limited, so we have a plan to put up tents in future so to accommodate if people are still going and the cases are still going [on] and in terms of human resources, we have human resources but we are thinking of sending more teams, more staff to help".

Dr. Tabang urged people to move away from bush areas in order to limit the transmission of the disease and encouraged people to use mosquito nets at night and in the evening to decrease the risk of being bitten. The symptoms of Kala azar include fever, weight loss, and loss of appetite. Without proper treatment the mortality rate for kala-azar almost 100 [percent].

[South Sudan and Sudan are highly endemic for Leishmaniasis. The statement that 200 people are infected in just 5 days is difficult to substantiate as the disease has an incubation period of weeks to months, but there is no doubt that Leishmania is highly prevalent, has a high mortality and is out of control.

A recent review of the distribution of Leishmaniasis (Alvar J et al & the WHO Leishmaniasis Control Team. Leishmaniasis worldwide and global estimates of its incidence. PLoS One. 2012;7:e35671. Supplementary material S81) which provides detailed data from South Sudan, reports that more than 90 per cent of global visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases occur in 6 countries: India, Bangladesh, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Brazil. The annual number of reported cases in Sudan is estimated between 15 700 and 30 300, and in South Sudan 7400 to 14 200 with an estimated underreporting of up to 8-fold in both countries. However, asymptomatic cases occur and the proportion of the population infected without symptoms is not known. 10 per cent of VL cases in South Sudan are estimated to be co-infected with HIV, and malnutrition is further adding to the risk of developing clinical leishmaniasis. - Mod.
