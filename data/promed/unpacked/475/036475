Arbovirus infections are emerging and re-emerging in several regions of the word because of several concomitant factors, including environmental and climate changes.

To contrast the diffusion of these infections, One Health intersectoral collaboration in the field of prevention, surveillance, and control can have a great impact.

The Public Health Working Group of MediLabSecure Network (https://www.medilabsecure.com/) has designed and conducted a situation analysis study to document how integration of laboratory/clinical human, animal, and entomological surveillance of arboviruses is being implemented in the Mediterranean and Black Sea Region. They applied a framework designed to assess 3 levels of integration: policy/institutional, data collection/data analysis, and dissemination.

The use of Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN) to graphically present evidence of intersectoral integration was also tested.

Serbia, Tunisia, and Georgia participated in the study. West Nile virus surveillance was analysed in Serbia and Tunisia, Crimea‚ÄêCongo haemorrhagic fever surveillance in Georgia. The framework enabled a standardized analysis of One Health surveillance integration, and BPMN was easily understandable and conducive to detailed discussions among different actors/institutions. In all countries, integration across sectors and levels was observed except in data collection and data analysis. Data collection was interoperable only in Georgia without integrated analysis. In all countries, surveillance was mainly oriented towards outbreak response, triggered by an index human case.

It would be worthwhile sharing situations from other countries.

[ProMED thanks Maria Grazia Dente for this useful contribution. The publication referred to above discusses the importance of multisectoral integration and use of the One Health approach towards control of Arbovirus infections. Surveillance data from 3 countries in the Mediterranean region focused on West Nile Virus in Tunisia and Serbia and CCHF in Georgia. The concept of 'One Health' has evolved as a collaborative effort of multiple disciplines to attain optimal health for people, animals, and the environment. The paper also identified certain 'recurrent' features in the 3 surveillance systems.

"The Study has highlighted that some features are common across all the 3 countries. In particular:
Animal and entomological surveillance are integral part of the systems, but the central role of the human surveillance is underlined by several factors:
- it is always the detection/notification of suspected human case/s that triggers the response of the systems and starts the flow of communication between sectors;
- a strategic plan and a multisector committee have been established in the three countries and are always under the coordination of the Directorates in charge for human surveillance;
- the human sector can be delegated by the other sectors in the dissemination of data and information and in the communication to the public, but the opposite is rare."

The authors conclude that, "Surveillance is at the core of all public health activities and is essential to prevent, detect, and respond to health threats effectively. It is conceivable that One Health surveillance may lead to faster disease detection, more efficient disease control and tangible financial savings when formally compared against separated surveillance streams especially in the case of arbovirus infections." - Mod.UBA
