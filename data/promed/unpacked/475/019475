Of the 141 suspected yellow fever cases in Jos North, Wase, Bassa, Kanam and Riyom Local Governments of Plateau State, 25 cases have been confirmed.

Following the yellow fever outbreak, the rapid response team from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, Abuja and National Primary Healthcare Development Agency was dispatched to the state for analysis and investigation.

Briefing the State Commissioner of Health, Dr. Lar Ndam alongside other stakeholders, the leader of the response team, Dr. Clement Da'am, revealed that after visiting the affected local governments, 141 suspected cases were discovered, of which 25 were confirmed.

He said the late detection of the outbreak, poor yellow fever mass vaccination campaigns, poor routine immunisation coverage, hard to reach settlements, understaffing and insufficient cold change equipment were some of the challenges and gaps that must be addressed, particularly in Wase Local Council, to forestall future outbreaks.

Da'am commended the state government, the state Primary Healthcare Board and other critical stakeholders and partners for being pro-active in the wake of the outbreak and solicited more surveillance.

Health commissioner, represented by the Ministry's permanent secretary, commended the response team for the prompt intervention, considering one case of yellow fever is considered an outbreak, promising to take seriously the Centre's recommendations.

[A 29 Dec 2019 The World Health Organization (WHO) report confirmed 13 cases of yellow fever (YF), with 3 deaths in 4 local government areas of Plateau State (see Yellow fever - Africa (01): Nigeria (PL) 20200101.6862783). Now, the case count has increased to 25 coming from 5 different local government areas. One hopes that the planned increase surveillance and vaccination campaigns can be carried out promptly. Vaccination is the best YF preventive measure. YF spread can get out-of-hand quickly in an under-vaccinated population. - Mod.TY
