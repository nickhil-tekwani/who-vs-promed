Viet Nam: Death of Another Suspected Human Case of Avian Influenza
--------------------------------------------------
A 17-year-old boy suspected of having avian influenza has died, Vietnamese
officials said today, as they banned poultry imports and stepped up
measures to stop the disease from spreading. Tests were being carried out
to determine whether the boy had contracted the [avian influenza] virus
that has killed 24 people in Viet Nam and 12 in Thailand in the last year.
The results were expected later this week.
The boy from the southern province of Bac Lieu died on Sat 15 Jan 2005, a
day after being admitted to hospital, said Nguyen Minh Tung, Director of
the Provincial Preventive Medicine Centre. He developed a high fever,
coughing and lung failure 3 days after he slaughtered a chicken, Tung said.
Avian influenza outbreaks among poultry have been reported across Viet Nam
in recent weeks, killing or forcing the cull of some 254 000 birds, the
Animal Health Department said on its Web site. Prime Minister Phan Van Khai
has ordered a temporary ban on poultry imports from neighbouring countries
to prevent the disease spreading. Khai did not specify poultry from which
countries, but most of Vietnam's poultry imports are from China. He also
urged ministers and provincial governors to step up measures to control,
prevent, and eradicate bird flu outbreaks and to ban the transportation of
poultry to and from infected areas. Police in the northern province of Lang
Son on Su16 Jan 2005 confiscated 1.5 tons of chickens being smuggled in
from China, the largest seizure so far, the Labour newspaper reported.

Viet Nam: Up to 10 Suspected Cases under Surveillance, But No Travel Ban
---------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Tue 18 Jan 2005 voiced concern about
the spread of avian influenza in Viet Nam, but said it was not considering
warning against travel there, as the risk of human infection was low.
5 people have died in Viet Nam since late December 2004, taking deaths
there to 25 since 2003, more than twice the toll in neighbouring Thailand,
the 2nd [and only other - Mod.CP] most affected Asian country. Vietnamese
authorities have told the United Nations agency that up to 10 additional
suspected human cases are under investigation and that the disease has
spread to all regions of the country, WHO spokeswoman Maria Cheng told
Reuters. "Our concern is that it looks like avian influenza has spread,"
she said. "There are a number of [human] cases under investigation across
the country." But at this stage, there was no need for any warning on
travel to Vietnam because the disease still posed a low risk to humans, she
added.
"The WHO is not considering any travel advisory at the moment. It is a
pretty low risk to public health because it requires close contact with
chickens," she said.
The WHO slapped travel advisories against parts of China and other
countries after a new flu-like disease SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome) emerged in the 1st half of 2003. The H5N1 [serotype avian
influenza] virus made the first known jump from bird to humans in Hong Kong
in 1997, killing 6 people, and any outbreak of the disease among poultry
raises fears of human cases.

[As of today (Tue 18 Jan 2005), the World Health Organisation (WHO) gives
the cumulative number of confirmed human cases of avian influenza A (H5N1)
virus infection since 28 Jan 2004 as 50 (17 in Thailand and 33 in Viet
Nam), and there have been 37 fatalities (12 in Thailand and 25 in Viet Nam)
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/en/>.
According to the above reports, the Vietnamese authorities have an
additional 10 suspected cases under investigation. There has been only a
single suspected case of transmission of infection from person to person;
consequently the risk to the human population remains low and no travel
advisory is being issued by WHO. - Mod.CP]
