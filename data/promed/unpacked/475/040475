A significant number of horses and veterinarians in Northern Palestine have been exposed to the West Nile virus, research reveals.

West Nile fever is a mosquito-borne disease affecting humans and domesticated animals.

In humans, about 80% of cases involve no symptoms, although in 20% of cases infected individuals develop flu-like symptoms for 3-6 days. Only about 1% of infected people fall seriously ill with neurological symptoms, mainly meningitis and encephalitis.

In horses, the clinical signs of West Nile infection include fever, impaired balance, behavioral changes, and muscle weakness or paralysis. About 10% of affected horses show neurological problems.

Ibrahim Alzuheir and his fellow researchers, writing in the journal Veterinary World, said the clinical signs of West Nile fever in horses can be hard to differentiate from those of other diseases, leading to misdiagnosis.

Serum samples from 100 veterinarians and 87 horses were collected for analysis, targeting cities in Northern Palestine. Antibodies against West Nile virus were detected in 60.9% of the horse serum samples and 23% of the samples from veterinarians.

In horses, location is a risk factor for the seropositivity, whereas age, sex, breed, and intended use of the animals were not associated with increased seropositivity.

The positive samples among the veterinarians were detected in all locations, age groups, experience length, and work sectors. The seropositivity was not influenced by these variables, the researchers said.

The authors noted that there is no vaccine against the virus available in Palestine, so all seropositive samples resulted from virus exposure. The results, they said, show that West Nile virus circulates in most regions of Palestine.

"WNF should be considered a hazard for specific occupational professions [see comment] and a public health concern. Physicians and veterinarians should consider related clinical symptoms in exposed workers and animals and promptly report suspected cases."

They said surveillance studies on animals, humans, and vectors are needed to better define areas where WNV and other mosquito-borne diseases are endemic.

[The above information is based upon a paper presented as Ref. 1, published online on 21 May 2021.

The term "Northern Palestine" in the said paper, refers to the following 6 districts in the West Bank (from north to south): Jenin, Tulkarm, Tubas, Nablus, Qalqilia, Ramallah (map available as figure 1 in the paper). The territories of Israel, and of the Palestinian authority (West Bank and Gaza Strip) belong to the same ecological niche.

WNV, a seasonal, mosquito-borne zoonosis, introduced annually by migrating birds, has been known since the 40's of the previous century to have become endemic in the said niche. In Israel, the disease has been found to affect humans, equines and geese. Attributing it to specific professions/occupations deserves caution; it could have a higher incidence in outdoor occupations.
