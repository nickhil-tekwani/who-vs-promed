(Date of last previously reported outbreak: March 1999).
Emergency report
-------------------------
Translation of an e-mail received on 14 July 1999 from Dr Ra√∫l
Omar Hernandez Paez, Director of Animal Health, Autonomous
Service of Agricultural Health (SASA), Ministry of Agriculture and
Animal Production, Caracas:
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 20 April 1999.
Date of confirmation of diagnosis: 5 May 1999.
Location: San Francisco de Asis, Zamora district, State of Aragua
No. of outbreaks: 1 farm
Description of affected population: broilers in a commercial farm.
The disease was observed in 2-week-old unvaccinated chicks.
They had been purchased from a hatchery supervised by the
SASA in the State of Carabobo.
Total number of animals in the outbreak:
susceptible : 4, 000
cases: ---
deaths: 2, 000
destroyed: 0
slaughtered: 2,000
Diagnosis: the clinical signs were nasal discharge and torticollis,
and the average daily mortality rate was 2.5% (i.e. 80 to 100 chicks
per day).
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: Institute of Veterinary
Investigations (national reference laboratory).
B. Diagnostic tests used: virus isolation.
C. Causal agent: velogenic strain of Newcastle disease virus.
Epidemiology: this outbreak of Newcastle disease is ascribed to
the low level of protection of the chicken population against the
disease. Neighbouring farms have been visited to verify that the
disease is absent in the surrounding area and that vaccination is
being used.
Control measures during reporting period:
- Chickens that were still healthy at the age of 6 weeks were sent
for slaughter.
- Disinfection of the chicken houses and associated equipment and
tools with a formalin solution consisting of 4 litres of formaldehyde
in 16 litres of water. Litter and feathers were removed and
incinerated.
- No restocking of the farm for at least 4 weeks.
- Following the notification of laboratory diagnosis, the farm was
visited on 7 and 18 May 1999 in order to verify implementation of
the sanitary measures stipulated by the SASA.
- Emphasis was placed on the need for any new birds introduced
into the farm to be vaccinated against Newcastle disease and
Gumboro disease.

[Newcastle disease virus is caused by an RNA virus,
paramyxovirus-1 (PMV-1), that can be categorized into 3 groups:
the velogenic strains which are highly pathogenic and easily
transmitted: the mesogenic strains, which show intermediate
patogenicity; and the lentogenic strains, which show low
pathogenicity in chickens.
Isolates that case the respiratory-nervous syndrome, even those
that are highly pathogenic, usually produce few or no distinctive
gross lesions; however isolates that cause the viscerotropic
syndrome often do. Velogenic and mesogenic virus isolates kill
injected 10-day-old chicken embryos in 2-4 days, lentogenic
isolates usually 4-6 days or not at all.
Parrots, mynahs, and such caged birds as pittas that moved in
commercial channels were the principal source of infection the
1970-72 US pandemic of the velogenic viscerotropic form of
Newcastle Disease Virus. An outbreak of PMV-1 occurred in
pigeons in the USA and the UK during 1984. This pigeon
paramyxovirus is lentogenic for chickens and occurs worldwide in
some pigeon populations - Mod.TG
