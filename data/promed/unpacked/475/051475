With some positive cases reported within a week, villagers of a VDC
[Village Development Committee] of Dang [Deokhuri] district are
living in the shadow of hepatitis B fear.

A 30-year-old man, his wife, and 2 daughters of Punkhola, Sashaniya
VDC, have been found suffering from the disease caused by hepatitis B
virus, which infects the liver of humans. It can lead to scarring of
the liver and an increased risk of liver cancer.

Villagers do [not?] go to the man's home after this family was found
to be in hepatitis B's grip and fear that the disease might spread.
"We are panicked after hepatitis B virus [infection] was diagnosed,"
said a local teacher. "The disease could strike others too as public
awareness about the disease is very low among the villagers in the VDC."

Tirtha Raj Gyawali, chairman of Good Governance of Youth Unity, who
returned to the district headquarters after a field visit to the
hepatitis B-hit area, said villagers are apprehensive of the disease.
"We have urged all to [have a] medical check-up," he said.

It is said that the health post nearby Punkhola is [a 4-hour] walk.
The distance has also added fear among local people.

According to doctors, chronic hepatitis B may eventually cause liver cancer.

[Previously, on 21 Feb 2010, it was reported that: "Just a few days
after 3 persons in a family committed suicide due to inability to
finance treatment of an epileptic daughter, 4 persons of a single
family have come forward with an appeal for help for treatment of
hepatitis B
(<http://www.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&news_id=15443>).
The members of this family (the subject of the current report) have
contracted the liver disease and are facing difficulty in [obtaining]
treatment. This family, who also has 12-year-old twin daughters and
an 8-year-old son, organized a press conference in Lamahi Sunday (28
Feb 2010) appealing for help. They said the uninfected 3 children
currently live in the ground floor while the others live upstairs on
doctor's advice. They also have separate kitchens to ensure that the
disease is not transmitted to the trio.

Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused
by hepatitis B virus (HBV). It is a major global health problem and
likely to be endemic throughout Nepal. Hepatitis B virus infection
can cause an acute illness with symptoms that last several weeks,
including yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine,
extreme fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. People can
take several months to a year to recover from the symptoms. Hepatitis
B virus can also cause a chronic liver infection that can later
develop into cirrhosis of the liver or liver cancer. The likelihood
that an hepatitis B virus infection will become chronic depends upon
the age at which a person becomes infected, with young children who
become infected with hepatitis B virus being the most likely to
develop chronic infections. About 90 percent of infants infected
during the 1st year of life develop chronic infections; 30 percent to
50 percent of children infected between 1 to 4 years of age develop
chronic infections. About 25 percent of adults who become chronically
infected during childhood die from hepatitis B virus-related liver
cancer or cirrhosis.

An effective vaccine against hepatitis B has been available since
1982, but it is unlikely that comprehensive vaccination has been
undertaken in Nepal. Hepatitis B vaccine is 95 percent effective in
preventing HBV infection and its chronic consequences,.
