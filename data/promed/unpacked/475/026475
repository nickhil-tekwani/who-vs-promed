Argentina takes precautions, as an FMD serotype appears in Brazil.
-----------------------------------------------
[A serotype of FMD (Foot & mouth disease) virus -- serotype C -- has been
reported in the Brazilian state of Amazonas, in the North of Brazil]. For
the past 9 years, this serotype has not been encountered in this region.
Although the possibility of the spread of infection to Argentina is low [it
is? - Mod.PC], production of a monovalent vaccine with this antigen has
been arranged in case of emergency.
The FMD outbreak was reported on an island in the Amazon river, in the
north of Brazil. The FMD serotype is considered to be an exotic serotype
for the region, and, although it does not represent a major risk for
Argentine cattle, precautionary measures have been adopted, and the
National Agrifood Health and Quality Service (SENASA) has been informed.
"The outbreak of FMD was reported in bovines on an island across from
Manaos, in the Amazon state. As reported by the Brazilian authorities, it
is a serotype C virus that only 9 years ago did not exist in the region,"
said Abraham Falzsuk, adviser to the president of SENASA, Jorge Amaya.
The appearance of the virus, which is considered to be exotic due to its
low frequency of occurrence in the region, was worrisome to Argentine
ranchers, especially those of the provinces of the North-East, who are
closer to the border of the neighboring country.
Spokesmen for the sector justified the worries of the ranchers, pointing
out that the reappearance of the virus in Brazil "after so many years might
mean that it had always been present, even though the neighboring country
never reported it." They also mentioned that the "antigen to serotype C is
not included in the FMD vaccine that is administered in the country."
The spokesmen specified that the locally applied vaccine is bivalent, O and
A, tetravalent in serotype, and contains, besides O, the antigens A-24,
A-2000, and A-2004.
"Effectively, the Argentine vaccine does not contain type C, because this
variant does not normally exist in our territory, but, although the
possibility that the infection will spread to the country is low, already,
the production of a vaccine monovalent with this antigen has been arranged
in case of a temporary emergency," Falzsuk said.
Falzsuk stated that, although this variety of FMD does not normally exist
in the country, "the antigen remains as a remnant in the bank of vaccines"
contracted by SENASA when Argentina was declared "free of FMD without
vaccination" in May 2000.
