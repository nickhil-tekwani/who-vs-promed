The article on The Jakarta Post website on 2 Nov 2012 titled Ebola virus found in Kalimantan's orangutan is highly misleading.

The article states that Nidom and his colleagues have "detected evidence of Ebola virus in several orangutans in Kalimantan," and that "65 out of 353 orangutans tested positive for Ebola virus."

Both statements are untrue.

Anyone can check the original research article, which is freely available online in the open access journal PLOS ONE, to verify that neither the Ebola nor Marburg virus have been detected in orangutans.

The paper only tells us that the tested animals [had] antibodies that react with the Ebola virus. As no viruses (or actually filoviruses) were detected, we cannot know whether the antibody positive animals are also virus positive, and thus potentially a reservoir for the disease.

It is important to note that the findings in the paper could also be explained by exposure to some other pathogen that induces cross-reacting antibodies with Ebola.

In short, we repeat, we do not know whether orangutans have Ebola or Marburg.

These scientific nuances matter greatly. As scientists, we should always ensure that we honestly tell what our research findings indicate. Regrettably, the Post article crosses the line between objective, scientific reporting and unsubstantiated scaremongering.

Of course, we need to be careful. If orangutans do have dangerous Ebola or Marburg-like diseases, this should be researched and reported to ensure that the public is informed about possible health risks, and necessary steps can then be taken by the authorities to prevent the disease from spreading.

As long as we do not know this for sure, we should stick to the facts.

As an orangutan conservation scientist, I am concerned. Orangutans are frequently killed in both Kalimantan and Sumatra for a range of reasons. If the news that orangutans have Ebola spreads through local media, it might very well increase the incidence of orangutan killings. People might not just consider orangutans a nuisance species that affects their crops but a potential risk to their lives and take action. The conservation implications of this inaccurate reporting could, therefore, be serious.

We plead with Nidom and his colleagues to clarify their findings -- what they know and what they don't know -- so that the public and authorities are accurately and objectively informed.

[The paper referred to can be accessed here:
http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0040740.

Evidence indicates that bats are the reservoirs for Filoviridae viruses such as Ebola and Marburg. These viruses can be lethal to primates (including humans) and other mammals. As the authors of the article above say, the antibodies found might indicate cross-reaction with other Filoviridae. This is especially likely given the occurrence outside of Africa. In any case, the finding raises concern for the conservation of these apes.

The interactive HealthMap/ProMED map of the affected area is available at: http://healthmap.org/r/3Z3m. - Mod.PMB]

[The paper concerned is extensively quoted in the previous posting in this thread (see below). Ebolaviruses include a serotype called Ebola-Reston, which is not known to cause human disease, and which originated in the Philippines, next door to the Indonesian state of Kalimantan on the island of Borneo and is part of the same ecosystem -- see map at http://www.hydrocarbons-technology.com/projects/bontang/images/img3.jpg.

But the highest antibody titers found were against African ebolaviruses, indicating a closer relationship of the agent producing those antibodies to them rather than to Reston. But a Reston-like virus with low patogenicity for primates could explain both the absence of reports of hemorrhagic fever cases in hunters butchering orang-utans, and the survival of such a relatively high proportion of the sparse orang-utan population.
