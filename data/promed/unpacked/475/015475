Rabies has been confirmed in 7 of Wyoming's 23 counties this year, and
although Carbon County has been free of the disease, officials are taking
steps to keep it that way.
The highest concentration has been in Fremont County, where 14 skunks and 1
cow have tested positive. In Sheridan County, 10 skunks, 1 horse and 1 cat
contracted the ailment, while Campbell and Natrona counties each have had
8 skunks with rabies.
A skunk and a cat had the disease in Crook County, while 1 skunk tested for
it in Converse County. In Hot Springs County, a bat had the virus.
Law enforcement officers in Carbon County are more wary of animals acting
strangely. "We have sent in more animals this year for testing than normal
because of our fear," Rawlins Police Chief Tony Rose said.
A clinic will be held July 18 at the fairgrounds so residents can have
their pets vaccinated for $10.
According to state epidemiologist Karl Musgrave, unvaccinated dogs and cats
are the chief carriers infecting people with the disease. "The best way to
prevent rabies from going from animals to humans is to make sure dogs and
cats are vaccinated," he said.
Pets and other domestic animals sometimes acquire the disease when bitten
by an infected wild animal.
Aside from pet owners, ranchers and others who regularly deal with animals
should be on the lookout, and animal bites should be reported immediately,
Rose said.

[Wyoming is a relatively large state and sparsely populated. An increase in
rabies recognizable to county officials is an indication of an increase in
this viral disease. The county must be applauded for its proactive steps to
safeguard pets an human lives and control the disease. However, farm
animals, horses and cattle, are equally susceptible to the disease. Since
these animals have interactions with humans, it is would be prudent to
vaccinate these animals. It is cheap insurance compared to a human life. -
