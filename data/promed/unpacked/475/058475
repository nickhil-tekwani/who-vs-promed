Surra (_Trypanosoma evansi_), Uruguay
-------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 24 Nov 2016 from Dr Carlos A Correa Messuti [OIE delegate for Uruguay, International Affairs Unit, Directorate-General for Livestock Services (DGSG), Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries (MGAP)], Montevideo, Uruguay

Summary
Report type: immediate notification (final report)
Date of start of the event: 7 Sep 2016
Date of confirmation of the event: 20 Oct 2016
Date event resolved: 19 Sep 2016
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease in the country
Causal agent: _Trypanosoma evansi_
Nature of diagnosis: clinical; laboratory (basic and advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Rivera, Rivera, Rivera
Date of start of the outbreak: 7 Sep 2016
Outbreak status: resolved on 19 Sep 2016
Epidemiological unit: not applicable
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Dogs / - / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
Affected population: the Rivera Health Directorate reported in September [2016] that private veterinarians in the city were informed of 2 groups of dogs that (apparently) integrate with packs of wild boar hunting dogs. One group came from the Northern Lakes area and the other from the city of Rivera. Dogs with clinical signs, which were still alive (4 animals had already died), had clinical signs such as edema, bleeding and anemia. The private veterinarians took blood samples from the dogs of both groups and they were sent to Montevideo, Department of Public Health Laboratories, Laboratory of Vector Surveillance, and to the Department of Parasitology and Mycology of the Institute of Hygiene.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: vectors
Epidemiological comment: samples from the dogs of Rivera were submitted to direct study, PCR, culture in appropriate media and inoculation in NUDE and Balb C mice. No infectious agent was identified in dogs from the Northern Lakes area. However, blood from a female dog of Rivera was infected with trypomastigote forms. Its parasitemia was quantified as 6 million protozoa/ml of blood. Molecular biological studies performed in the Rivera female dog were able to identify that the trypanosome involved was _Trypanosoma evansi_. Cultures and mouse inoculation were positive. The authorities from the Ministry of Health will carry out an outbreak investigation on site. Treatment was applied in the Rivera female dog, but she did not respond favorably, she was then euthanized on 19 Nov [2016].

Control measures
Measures applied: screening; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Institute of Hygiene (national laboratory) / Dogs / parasitological examination / 10 Sep 2016 / Positive
Pasteur Institute (national laboratory) / Dogs / inoculation test / 20 Oct 2016 / Positive
Pasteur Institute (national laboratory) / Dogs / real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 15 Sep 2016 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

"_Trypanosoma evansi_ causes a trypanosomosis known as 'surra'. It affects a large number of wild and domesticated animal species in Africa, Asia, and Central and South America. The principal host species varies geographically, but camels, horses, buffalos and cattle are particularly affected, although other animals, including wildlife, are also susceptible. It is an arthropodborne disease; several species of haematophagous flies, including tabanids and stomoxes, are implicated in transferring infection from host to host, acting as mechanical vectors. In Brazil, vampire bats are also implicated in a unique type of biological transmission.

The general clinical signs of _T. evansi_ infections: pyrexia directly associated with parasitaemia together with a progressive anaemia, loss of condition and lassitude are not sufficiently pathognomonic for diagnosis. Recurrent episodes of fever and parasitaemia occur during the course of the disease. Oedema, particularly of the lower parts of the body, urticarial plaques and petechial haemorrhages of the serous membranes are sometimes observed in horses. Abortions have been reported in buffalos and camels. Nervous signs are common in horses. The disease causes immunodeficiencies that may be of high impact when interfering with other diseases or vaccination campaigns (foot and mouth disease and haemorrhagic septicaemia for example)."

Humans possess innate resistance against many species of trypanosomes, including _T. evansi_, due to the trypanolytic activity of the serum protein apolipoprotein LI. Nevertheless, there have been a small number of human infections with atypical trypanosomes, including a few infections caused by _T. evansi_. Whether illnesses caused by this organism are underestimated or occur very rarely and under unusual circumstances is currently unclear. http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/surra.pdf - Mod.CRD
