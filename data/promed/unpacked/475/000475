The Department of Health and Human Services announces 9 additional cases; 3 of the 9 were patients in hospital B (St. Mary's Hospital in Pyeongtaek), where index patient and medical staff.

1 other patient was at hospital E 28-30 May 2015 in the same hospital room as case No. 16.

The remaining 5 patients were at hospital D on 27 or 28 May 2015 in the emergency department where other patient's were (?case no. 14).

[With the addition of these 9 newly confirmed cases, there are now 50 cases of MERS-CoV associated with the ongoing outbreak in South Korea. If my interpretation of the machine translation is correct, there are 3 generations of cases -- generation no.1, the index case who traveled to the Middle East where he was infected; generation no.2 with 35 cases confirmed to date; and generation 3 with 14 cases to date. (see moderator comment following section [2] below - it is possible that there are more tertiary cases in hospital B). Of note, the Ministry of Health has released the name of Hospital B as St. Mary's Hospital in Pyeongtaek (see media report in section [2] below).

Given the large number of cases, presumably related to lack of infection control procedures in the healthcare environment combined with lack of suspicion for MERS-CoV infection, there have been concerns raised re: the actual virus involved in this outbreak. According to a media report from China, sequencing of the isolate in China showed no substantial changes in the virus from those in the Middle East (see section [4] below).

Pyeongtaek is located in the southwestern portion of Gyeonggi Province. According to Wikipedia, it is home to a South Korean naval base and a large concentration of United States troops. (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyeongtaek, including a map of the province)

[2] South Korea, involved hospitals, more details - media report
Date: 6 Jun 2015

http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20150605001037


The Korean government on Friday [5 Jun 2015] named the hospital in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, where 71 percent of all confirmed Middle East respiratory syndrome cases in Korea have occurred since [20 May 2015], backtracking on its previous stance to withhold a list of affected facilities.

Visitors to the facility -- now identified as Pyeongtaek St. Mary's Hospital - from [15-29 May 2015] have been urged to report themselves to the authorities.

As of Friday [5 Jun 2015] afternoon, the virus had killed 4 people, infected 42 [now 50, see above MOH report in section [1] - Mod.MPP] and pushed public health officials to quarantine more than 1800 others. The Seoul Municipal Government is separately placing some 1500 more people in isolation.

"We have decided to take more proactive measures for those who either stayed at or visited the specific facility, as an overwhelming number of the infection cases -- 30 out of 42 -- took place at the hospital," Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo said.

In spite of strong public demand and even repeated requests from Hong Kong health authorities, Seoul has been standing firm on its decision not to share the names of MERS-affected hospitals -- to prevent "unnecessary fear and stigmatization."

To date, 14 facilities have been confirmed as MERS-affected hospitals, meaning they have received confirmed MERS patients at least once during the outbreak. The Health Ministry said it had no plan to share the names of the 13 remaining facilities.

Also on Friday [5 Jun 2015], President Park Geun-hye visited one of the 17 government-certified facilities where confirmed MERS patients are being treated in quarantine to encourage the medical staff. It was her 1st on-site visit related to MERS since the 1st case was confirmed more than 2 weeks ago.

Pyeongtaek St. Mary's Hospital, which was shut down on [29 May 2015], is one of the 4 medical facilities that the nation's 1st confirmed patient either visited or stayed at prior to his diagnosis on [20 May 2015].

The 1st patient stayed at the facility from [15 to 17 May 2015]. Up until Wednesday [3 Jun 2015], the Health Ministry had been claiming that the 68-year-old was the sole spreader of the disease in the facility, meaning all of the confirmed patients who contracted the virus there were infected by him only, not by each other.

Yet on Friday it was revealed that 2 of the 6 newly confirmed patients caught the virus while staying at the hospital from [20-28 May 2015]. During this period, the 1st confirmed patient was not present in the facility. The newly reported cases prove that tertiary infection occurred at the hospital before it was shut down on [29 May 2015].

Minister Moon also said the air-conditioning system of the hospital, as well as its lack of ventilators, may have attributed to the intense spread of MERS among its patients. Civil experts who work with the government also confirmed that the virus was found in the temporarily closed facility's bathrooms and doorknobs. The hospital, which houses about 400 beds, opened in February [2015] and its building is reportedly less than a year old.

Fears of the deadly virus is only expanding as the Seoul municipal government abruptly announced on Thursday night [4 Jun 2015] that the 35th confirmed patient, a medical doctor, may have exposed more than 1500 Seoul residents to the deadly virus.

Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon claimed that the doctor, who treated the 14th confirmed MERS patient at a large general hospital in Seoul on [27 May 2015], attended 3 large-scale conferences over the weekend while showing symptoms of MERS.

The Health Ministry on Thursday [4 Jun 2015] rebuked Seoul City's claim that it was limiting information on the infected doctor, and claimed it has shared all relevant information on the tracking of the medical professional.

According to Mayor Park, the doctor started showing mild symptoms, mainly coughing, on [29 May 2015], but still attended the events in which more than 1500 people attended. He did so despite being advised to stay home and being aware of the possibility of his infection, the municipal government said.

The doctor, however, said he never "treated" the 14th patient, although they were both in the same emergency room for less than an hour on [27 May 2015]. The doctor in fact treated an embolism patient who later was quarantined after being placed near the 14th patient at the facility.

The medical professional claimed that he hadn't even been informed that the 14th MERS patient was in the same emergency room with him and his patient on [27 May 2015] until [31 May 2015].

"I learned on [31 May 2015] that the patient I treated on [27 May 2015] was quarantined for possible MERS infection. I only attended 2 of the 3 events that the city government has mentioned," he said during an interview with a local newspaper.

"As I began to experience unusual symptoms, I reported to the authorities on [31 May 2015] and was quarantined at home on the same day. I was eventually placed at a government-certified medical facility on Tuesday [2 May 2015], the same day I was informed about my MERS diagnosis."

The doctor said that although he was coughing on Saturday [30 May 2015] -- the day he showed up at 2 large-scale events attended by 1565 others -- it was because of his chronic sinus infection, not MERS. According to him, he started experiencing MERS symptoms, including unusual sputum production, on [31 May 2015]. Yet health experts said his claims could not be proven, as it is hard to differentiate MERS symptoms -- usually fever and coughing -- with symptoms of other common diseases such as the flu.

"The incubation period of MERS is 2 to 14 days," said a doctor who wished to remain anonymous. "He started coughing 2 days after staying with the MERS patient in the same room. So no one can be really sure whether he was coughing on [29 May 2015] because of MERS or because of his sinus infection."

Regardless, Seoul Mayor Park announced that the municipal government is launching its own countermeasures to combat the disease. All 1565 individuals who were present at the events where the infected doctor attended will be quarantined, he said. As of Thursday [4 Jun 2015] morning, the city government managed to contact 84.2 percent of the 1565, advising them to stay home, the mayor said.

Meanwhile, all of the newly confirmed cases are believed to be tertiary infection cases. One of them has been identified as an air force officer serving at the Osan Air Base in Pyeaongtaek.

Following the 1st MERS case in the military, the Defense Ministry quarantined 164 soldiers and 6 civilians. Among them, a navy staff sergeant visited her grandfather, who later was diagnosed with MERS, at a Daejeon-based hospital on [29 May 2015]. Although currently asymptomatic, she is scheduled to be tested for the infection.

The 4th death occurred Thursday [4 Jun 2015]. The deceased is a 76-year-old who became the 3rd confirmed patient on [21 May 2015]. He had been suffering from preexisting medical conditions including asthma and cancer before his MERS diagnosis.

A total of 1317 schools and kindergartens, including 15 universities, canceled classes to prevent possible infection as of Friday [5 Jun 2015] afternoon nationwide.

While the number of cases keeps growing, the Health Ministry began investigating if the virus has mutated in Korea and become more contagious. The investigation results are set to be released soon.

A special inspection team from the World Health Organization is to arrive in Seoul to examine the situation as early as next week.

"Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol-generating procedures," said WHO in its statement on the outbreak in Korea.

"WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions."

Those who visited Pyeongtaek St. Mary's Hospital can report themselves by either calling 129 or visiting <www.mw.go.kr>.

Seoul residents who wish to be tested for MERS can call the Seoul Metropolitan Government at 120 or 2133-0691 through 7.

[The above media report is very helpful in explaining some of the difficult machine translations from the MOH website, where there is mention that cases were treated in Hospital B apparently after the index case was no longer there. Hence, it is possible that the 3 cases I designated as secondary cases may in fact be tertiary cases. Hopefully the detailed discussions of cases provided in the WHO updates will help clarify the situation.

As for the doctor discussed as potentially having exposed more than 1500 individuals, the main hope is that 1) he wasn't very infectious at the time of the meetings he attended and 2) if he was infectious at that time, he is not a superspreader.

The media report also confirms a positive MERS-CoV among a military individual. Most likely confirming the suspected case mentioned in a media report in an earlier ProMED-mail post (see section [5] of MERS-CoV (54): South Korea, Saudi Arabia, WHO 20150604.3407535). - Mod.MPP]

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Republic of Korea 5 Jun 2015
-------------------------------
On [4 Jun 2015], the National IHR Focal Point of the Republic of Korea notified WHO of 6 additional confirmed cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), including 1 death.

Details of the cases are as follows:

1- A 69-year-old male developed symptoms on [1 Jun 2015] while admitted to hospital for an unrelated medical condition since 28 May [2015]. The patient shared the room with a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case that was reported in a previous DON on [4 Jun 2015] (case n. 1). He tested positive for MERS-CoV on [3 Jun 2015].

2- A 54-year-old man developed symptoms on 29 May [2015]. After receiving medical care, he did not experience further symptoms. On 15, 22 and 29 May [2015], the patient visited his mother who is a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case that was reported in a previous DON on 30 May [2015] (case n. 10). He tested positive for MERS-CoV on [3 Jun 2015].

3- A 47-year-old male developed symptoms on 21 May [2015]. He sought medical care at different health facilities before being admitted to hospital on [1 Jun 2015]. The patient is a friend of a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case (case 2 - see above). He visited his friend's mother on 15 May [2015]. The patient, who has no comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [3 Jun 2015].

4- A 25-year-old female health worker developed symptoms on 20 May [2015]. The patient provided care to the 1st case from 15 to 17 May [2015]. She tested positive for MERS-CoV on [3 Jun 2015]. Currently, the patient is in stable condition.

5- A 38-year-old male doctor developed symptoms on 31 May [2015]. On 27 May [2015], the patient was exposed to a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case that was reported in a previous DON on [1 Jun 2015] (case n. 1). He tested positive for MERS-CoV on [2 Jun 2015].

6- An 82-year-old male tested positive for MERS-CoV on [4 Jun 2015]. The patient, who suffered from chronic productive cough, developed low-grade fever and dyspnoea on 6 May [2015]. As symptoms worsened, on 9 May [2015], he was admitted to hospital. From 28 to 30 May [2015], the patient was admitted to the same ward as a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case that was reported in a previous DON on [4 Jun 2015] (case n. 1). On 30 May [2015], to avoid close contact with the MERS-CoV patient, he was transferred to an isolated room in ICU. The patient passed away on [3 Jun 2015].

Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for the cases.

So far, a total of 36 MERS-CoV cases, including 3 deaths, have been reported to WHO by the National IHR Focal Point of the Republic of Korea. One of the 36 cases is the case that was confirmed in China and also notified by the National IHR Focal Point of China.

Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1185 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 443 related deaths.

[With the confirmation of the 36 cases involved in the South Korean outbreak, the global tally of MERS-CoV infected individuals reported to WHO is now at 1185 including at least 443 related deaths. The WHO reports are very helpful in providing good summaries of the epidemiologic information surrounding each of the cases available without using sub-optimal machine translations. - Mod.MPP]

China completes genome sequencing of imported MERS case
------------------------------------
Scientists have completed sequencing the genome of the 1st case of imported Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and found no evidence of variation that would make the virus more contagious.

The sequencing was accomplished on Wednesday [3 Jun 2015] by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention in cooperation with health department of Guangdong Province, where the case was reported on [29 May 2015].

The genome map of the virus shows high homology with MERS-CoV detected in the Middle East. Scientists believe the strain originated in Saudi Arabia.

The result of the sequencing has been uploaded to GenBank at National Center for Biotechnology Information in the United States.

The patient from the Republic of Korea who tested positive for MERS is still being treated at Huizhou Municipal Central Hospital in Guangdong.

By testing and comparing genome sequence of different strains, scientists may find effective measures to prevent the spread of the disease.

[In the absence of evidence of significant genetic changes in the virus involved in the outbreak in South Korea, it serves to further confirm that the situation is a combination of failure of infection control procedures and a superspreader(s) (it appears as though the index case was a superspreader, and perhaps case no.16 as the number of tertiary cases with a history of contact with case no.16 continues to grow). - Mod.MPP]

As of 12 Noon today 5 Jun 2015 there have been a total of:
1024 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including
450 deaths
563 recoveries and
11 currently active cases including 2 cases on home isolation

In the past 24 hours there have been:
5 newly confirmed cases
0 new fatalities and
0 recoveries reported

Information on the newly confirmed cases:

1- Hufoof: 58-year-old Saudi female, non-healthcare worker, currently in stable condition. History of possible contact with case(s) under review.

2- Hufoof: 41-year-old Saudi male, healthcare worker, currently in stable condition. Positive history of contact with other case(s) in either the healthcare environment or community.

3- Hufoof: 29-year-old Saudi male, healthcare worker, currently in stable condition. Positive history of contact with other case(s) in either the healthcare environment or community.

4- Jeddah: 55-year-old Expat male, non-healthcare worker, currently in critical condition. No history of contact with other case(s).

5- Riyadh: 58-year-old Expat male, non-healthcare worker, currently in critical condition. No history of contact with other case(s).

[While the South Korean outbreak has been taking front and center in discussions of MERS-CoV over the past 2 weeks, the outbreak and transmission of the MERS-CoV continues in Saudi Arabia. There have now been 26 cases confirmed in Hufoof since 20 Apr 2015. The initial cluster of cases was reported to be in a large extended family in the same household, but since mid-May 2015, the outbreak has been nosocomial, with contact in the healthcare environment. In today's (5 Jun 2015) newly confirmed cases 2 of the 3 cases reported from Hufoof are in healthcare workers. The cases reported from Jeddah and Riyadh appear to be "sporadic" cases, not involving contact with other cases in either the healthcare environment or in the community.

With these 5 newly reported cases, Saudi Arabia has reported 1024 laboratory-confirmed cases including 450 deaths (reported case fatality rate 43.9 percent) since June 2012.

On 29 May 2015, the National IHR Focal Point of Oman notified WHO of 1 additional case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Details of the case are as follows:

A 75-year-old male from Al Dahir village developed symptoms on 11 May [2015] and was admitted to hospital on 19 May [2015]. He was treated symptomatically and discharged on 20 May [2015]. As symptoms worsened, on 25 May [2015], the patient was admitted to the same hospital. He tested positive for MERS-CoV on 29 May [2015]. The patient has no comorbidities but he is a heavy smoker. The patient owns a barn with camels and young calves, and has frequent contact with them. He has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Currently, the patient is in stable condition in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward. Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for the case. Investigation of camels in the barn of the case is also ongoing.

Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1155 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 434 related deaths.

[The global tally of cases of MERS-CoV infection included in the above report on Oman does not include yesterday's WHO reported cases from South Korea (15 cases) and Saudi Arabia (9 cases). Unfortunately I did not see this update on the WHO website until after the daily update was published. The case referred to in this update was reported by the Omani MOH on its website on 31 May 2015 (see MERS-CoV (52): Oman, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, WHO, RFI 20150531.3399248). At that time he was noted to have "severe pneumonia and high fever." The history of heavy smoking would categorize as a co-morbidity given the likelihood of pulmonary damage related to the smoking. As this is a "sporadic" case, the history of contact with camels including juveniles increases the likelihood of exposure to infected camels, as the juveniles are more likely to have an active MERS-CoV infection. Presumably the camels in his barn have been tested for MERS-CoV infection, and genetic studies on the virus(es) will be forthcoming.
