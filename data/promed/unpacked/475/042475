New outbreaks (1)
Outbreak 1: Isikli, Kozan, Adana
Date of start of the outbreak: 17 Sep 2018
Outbreak status Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Sheep / 214 / 23 / 11 / 0 / 0

Affected population: 1st symptoms of the disease were seen on 17 Sep 2018. The disease was detected as positive by Adana Veterinary Control Institute, which is the regional laboratory. Afterwards, defibrinated blood samples were sent for serotyping to Etlik Veterinary Control Central Research Institute, which is the national reference laboratory for bluetongue. As a result of the serotyping, 4 samples were detected as BTV8 positive; 15 samples were detected as BTV4 positive, and 4 samples were detected as both type positive.

[Bluetongue outbreaks, affecting primarily sheep, have been reported from Turkey since 1977; throughout the years, serotypes BTV-4 (the most common one), BTV-9 and BTV-16 have been reported. It may be assumed that BTV-1 had been circulating in Turkey as well: it was reported, in 2009, from the Greek islands adjacent to the Turkish coast, while no cases were reported at that time from continental Greece.

The disease is probably under-reported in Turkey. Since 2008, outbreaks have been reported in the Aegean parts of Greece, in particular the islands Chios and Lesvos. In 2009, this included, on top of serotype 1, also BTV-8 and BTV-16. The event was resolved in August 2013. Similar strains were reported from other east-Mediterranean countries (Cyprus, Israel).

The current event, in Isikli, Adana province, is situated far from western Turkey in the center of Turkey's Mediterranean coastline coastal regions, about 100 km [62.1 miles] distant from Syria's Aleppo province (map at https://tinyurl.com/ydakng72). It is not clear which of the 2 identified strains, 8 or 4, was the (main? only?) cause of clinical disease in sheep. It will be interesting to know which BTV strain(s) was/were included in the vaccine used and to obtain the genetic profile of the involved BTV-8 strain. - Mod.AS
