The bluetongue disease [BT] nightmare returns to Sardinia.

According to Coldiretti data, 12 000 animals are already involved, 11 dead, 7 active outbreaks, 28 suspected and 32 [resolved], with data unfortunately continuously updated.

Active outbreaks are found in the lower Oristano area and in Ogliastra. The suspects are mainly in Sulcis, while many of those already extinct were found in north-central Sardinia and in particular in the western part.

Last year [2021], even if it did not reach the dramatic percentages (between heads involved and deaths) -- argues Coldiretti -- of the heavy waves that have afflicted the sheep and goat sector for over 20 years, more than 30 000 sheep died and over 1 million were involved.

The Region under pressure from Coldiretti Sardinia in the end allocated 7.1 million euros [about USD 7.07 million] which have not yet arrived in the pockets of the shepherds despite the fact that the Agricultural Organization had presented a system that would have made it possible to liquidate the practices in a few weeks.

"There is no time to waste -- says the president of Coldiretti Sardinia, Battista Cualbu -- it is essential to immediately take action with an emergency plan that limits the spread of the bluetongue and its harmful effects to a minimum, which unfortunately we know well, avoiding the final blow for a sector afflicted by the high prices and the heavy economic crisis we are experiencing. In addition to the shepherds, the virus also affects cattle farmers, true reservoirs of the virus, and indirect victims with the continuous blockages of the movement that involves the tests of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), with a cost of about 25 euros [about USD 24.90], and treatment with repellents in the 7 days preceding the departure of the animal."

[It may be assumed, though pending confirmation, that the BT virus serotype in Sardinia is similar to the one currently circulating in Spain and Portugal, namely BTV-4. This serotype is known as highly pathogenic for susceptible sheep breeds, case-fatality rate exceeding, in some cases, 50%. The Sardinian dairy sheep breed is known to be one of the most susceptible, as has been demonstrated several times in Sardinia since 2000 (BTV 1st introduction to Sardinia), and earlier when exported Sardinian sheep were exposed to BTV elsewhere.

Cattle, on the other hand, are readily infected by the BTV vector (_Culicoides_ species) and undergo viraemia, but in most cases, with the exception of BTV-8 infection, without clinical disease. Due to their prolonged viraemia following infection, cattle become a potential introducer of the virus into free areas with highly susceptible local sheep. According to EC legislation cattle are not allowed to be moved outside an infected zone unless vaccinated and or tested negative by PCR. The costs caused by such measures and to delayed movement to slaughter or breeding purposes, are considerable. The southern parts of Sardinia are declared, by EC, as endemically infected by BTV serotypes 1, 3, and 4; the north, by serotypes 1 and 4, as can be seen in EC's bluetongue map at https://food.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2022-09/ad_control-measures_bt_restrictedzones-map.pdf (last updated September 2022).

BT is a WOAH-listed, vector-borne, seasonal, non-zoonotic disease. When temperatures significantly decrease, the event is expected to terminate. - Mod.AS
