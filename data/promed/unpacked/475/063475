Re: Part [2] of Measles - USA: (PA) ex India, alert
-----------------------------------------
I am an EIS [Epidemic Intelligence Service] officer who is assisting
with the investigation of the measles outbreak centered on
Pittsburgh. I would like to address an error in the 2nd article by
the Tribune-Democrat. In fact, various secondary measles cases went
to Seven Springs and the other locations listed in that article, not
the index case who traveled from India. Correct information may be
found in the press releases on the Pennsylvania Department of Health
website at
<http://www.health.state.pa.us>,
or the Allegheny County Health Department website at
<http://www.achd.net>.

information published in the Tribune-Democrat, which was reproduced
as Part [2] of "Measles - USA: (PA) ex India, alert." We appreciate
