VERTICILLIUM WILT, OILSEED RAPE - UK: SPREAD

Verticillium wilt has been widespread in Europe for decades and was
first identified in the south of England in 2007 [ProMED-mail post
20071001.3239], said Dr Peter Gladders, ADAS [Agricultural Development
and Advisory Service].

The disease causes premature ripening, which can cause seed shedding
during harvest. Harvesting contractors were alerted to a cluster of
cases in south Lincolnshire last year [2009], leading to fears that
the disease is working its way north and could affect growers in
Leicestershire.

It affects brassicas and closely related weed species such as charlock
and is spread by spores that remain viable in the soil for years. It
is hard to control, Dr Gladders said. Despite being present on the
Continent for 50 years, no resistant varieties have yet been bred, and
there is no chemical treatment.

Dr Gladders said: "At the moment, the only control mechanism is to
avoid growing oilseed too tightly in the rotation. Research completed
in Germany suggests it should be grown no more frequently than once in
every 4 years. Later drilling also seems to help control it. By
contrast, early drilling in warmer conditions may encourage it."

Farmers are also advised to be on the lookout for other diseases such
as clubroot, sclerotinia and light leaf spot, which can cause
significant yield loss.

[Verticillium wilt of oilseed rape (_Brassica napus_) is caused by the
soilborne vascular fungus _Verticillium longisporum_. This species is
pathogenic only on _Brassica_ species and occurs in many continental
European countries as well as in Japan, the USA and, most recently,
the UK. Increasing areas of intense rapeseed cultivation has rendered
the pathogen a growing threat to oilseed rape production, particularly
in Europe.

Unlike other _Verticillium_ species, _V. longisporum_ does not induce
wilting but premature senescence and ripening, which may severely
reduce yields by up to 50 percent. It can survive in dead plant tissue
and soil for extended periods. Sufficient genetic resistance is not
available in oilseed rape, but interspecific hybridisation may provide
a resource for developing resistant crop lines.

_V. longisporum_ appears to be a host-adapted pathogen. Other species
in the genus specialise in different host families, for example _V.
dahliae_ affects solanaceous plants and _V. albo-atrum_ is associated
with a wilt of hops.

The other diseases mentioned are sclerotinia (also called stem rot,
white mould) caused by the fungus _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_; clubroot
caused by the fungus _Plasmodiophora brassicae_; and light leaf spot
caused by the fungus _Pyrenopeziza brassicae_. For more information on
these diseases, see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives.
