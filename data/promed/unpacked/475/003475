The heads of the [sub-regional?] veterinary directorates have informed the
governor of the region that foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreaks have
been registered in 6 out of the 8 districts of the Chui region.
The decision to establish a commission to supervise the veterinary
activities in all 8 sub-districts was accepted at the board session of
regional state administration. Employees of local veterinary offices,
representatives of the ministry of agriculture, water management and the
processing industry, and employees of the State department of veterinary
science were included in the commission. Experts will check the conditions
of storage of vaccines, the plan for carrying out vaccination against FMD,
and the vaccination follow-up system by issuance of certificates of
[vaccines applied], signed by the cattle owners.
According to Alybek Sadykov, chief of the Zhajylskiy regional veterinary
management, a principal cause for the spread of FMD is animal migration. He
noted that "the sick cattle are delivered in our area from other regions,
in particular, from Batken, Jalal-Abad, and Talas".

[Kyrgyzstan is administratively divided into the following 8 1st-order
divisions: Batken, Chui, Bishkek (capital), Jalal-Abad, Naryn, Osh, Talas,
and Issyk-Kul; see map at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/kyrgyzstan_pol_05.pdf>.
Chui is the 4th division reportedly found suspected or infected with FMD
since the beginning of May 2007, following Batken, Talas, and Osh. However,
no notification has been sent, so far, to the OIE [Office International des
Epizooties; World Organization for Animal Health] and neither the serotype
of the involved virus, nor the one(s) included in the applied vaccine, are
known.
The website of the World Reference Laboratory for FMD at Pirbright, UK,
includes information about the following FMD virus (FMDV) serotypes
identified in Kyrgyzstan in recent years: FMDV Asia 1 in 2004 and FMDV O in
2006; see
<http://www.iah.bbsrc.ac.uk/virus/Picornaviridae/Aphthovirus/fmd_genotyping/asia/krg.htm>.
FMD seems to be spreading in Transcaucasia (Armenia) and eastwards
(Kazakhstan); information on the situation in other countries in the region
would be helpful. - Mod.AS]
