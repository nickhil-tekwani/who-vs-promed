Examination of bodily samples collected from the carcass of a tusker that was found near Anaikkatti here on [Thu 17 Mar 2022] revealed that it did not die of anthrax, the Forest Department said on [Sun 20 Mar 2022].

The carcass was [necropsied] on [Sun 20 Mar 2022] as the Forest Department received the laboratory results on [Sat 19 Mar 2022] evening. Veterinarians, who autopsied the carcass, said the tusker aged around 30 could have died due to an injury it suffered in a fight with another male elephant. The carcass had a piercing wound similar to the one caused by tusks during a fight between 2 male elephants, a veterinarian said.
