A seemingly rabid bat was found in the patio of a house in the city of Berisso, causing the deployment of a health worker in the area, according to a source in the community. The bat was found when the owner of the house saw her cat playing with the animal.

Alarmed, the woman called the local Civil Defense, which advised her to take the bat to the Anti-rabies Institute for testing, which the woman subsequently did.

Last Friday [16 Mar 2012], Institute personnel communicated with the woman to inform her that the bat had rabies, indicating that she had to sacrifice her cat.

After sacrificing the pet and advising the local health authorities, a health operation was initiated in the area, which included vaccination of dogs and cats living within a 2-block radius of where the bat was discovered and anti-rabies [post exposure] treatment is being given to the woman and the family of the residence.

[This is a good example of the need to have pets vaccinated regularly against rabies, including house cats that may not venture far from the house. Cats find ill or injured bats irresistible to play with, as was the case reported above. The species of bat involved in this case is not specified, nor if the woman and her family were bitten by it. The cat was undoubtedly exposed, and if not previously vaccinated, sacrifice was the most reasonable option to prevent rabies infection in it with subsequent exposure of the human in contact with the feline.

The recent rabies cases in Argentina have involved bovine and equine animals attacked by vampire bats. The case above may involve an insectivorous or other type of colonial-roosting bat, rather than a vampire bat seeking a blood meal.
