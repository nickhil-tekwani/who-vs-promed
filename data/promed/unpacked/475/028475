[The reports of 12 newly confirmed cases including 2 deaths, 6 in Riyadh and 6 in Jeddah bring the total of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia to 224 including 74 deaths. Of note, 3 of the 6 cases reported in Jeddah are noted to be asymptomatic, 2 of whom were contacts of other confirmed cases, and the 3rd is mentioned to operate in the health field, so presumably a known contact of one or more of the hospitalized cases in the Jeddah outbreak. With respect to the cases reported in Riyadh, all 6 appear to be newly identified clinical cases of MERS-CoV infection, with one fatal case, and the other 5 with serious illness receiving intensive care therapy.
