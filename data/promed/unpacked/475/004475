A judge has ruled that sisters aged 15 and 11 must have the MMR vaccine even though they and their mother do not want it, BBC Newsnight has learned. The High Court decision, made last month [September 2013], came after the girls' father brought a case seeking vaccination. The parents, now divorced, had agreed when married not to vaccinate the girls in the wake of the MMR controversy. But the discrediting of concerns about an MMR autism link and recent measles outbreaks changed the father's view. In 2003, a mother was ordered to have her child immunised against measles, mumps and rubella after the court ruled the benefits of vaccination outweighed the risks. In 2011, children in care were ordered to have the MMR jab against the wishes of their parents.

When outlining her decision in the latest case, Mrs Justice Theis emphasised it was a specific case "only concerned with the welfare needs of these children," but lawyers say as one of a series it confirms there is no longer any debate about the benefits of the vaccine. The father of the 2 girls says that this change, combined with an outbreak of measles in Swansea late last year [2012], changed his mind in January 2013 about whether his daughters should be given the MMR jab. He says he was worried these diseases could have serious consequences.

According to the text of the court decision, seen by BBC Radio Newsnight, the father's solicitor wrote to the girls' mother in January 2013 seeking her agreement that they should now be vaccinated and saying that if she did not agree, he would take the matter to court. The mother did not agree, and the matter eventually came before the Family Division of the High Court.

A court-appointed welfare officer who spoke extensively to the girls said that neither of them wanted the vaccination. The children were particularly concerned about the ingredients in the vaccine, which include animal-based materials; one of the girls is a vegan. However, the officer said that when she asked them what would happen if they became ill with measles, mumps or rubella and needed medicine, they clearly had not thought about what the ingredients in that medicine might be. The welfare officer said both children had been strongly influenced by their mother, who was very anxious about the jab.

Mrs Justice Theis decided that it was in the best interests of the children that they were vaccinated. "I am aware that this is against the girls' wishes but that that it is not the only factor," she wrote. "The court also has to consider their level of understanding of the issues involved and what factors have influenced their views. I do not consider there is a balanced level of understanding by them of the issues involved."

The mother's lawyer, Philippa Dolan, told Newsnight that the girls had not yet been vaccinated despite the deadline to do so having passed on Thursday [10 Oct 2013]. She said: "There are practical difficulties in enforcing the order, and that is at the moment an ongoing issue. There's not a legal deadline that's a serious issue; the parents are in discussion, and everyone hopes it will be resolved without any more litigation."

An increase in measles cases earlier this year [2013] has not continued in the last 3 months, figures show. There were 151 clinically suspected measles cases in the 1st 9 months of 2013, up from 57 cases over the same period last year [2012], a Health Protection Scotland (HPS) report has found. Cases of the infection had risen sharply earlier this year with 100 notifications of suspected measles between April and June 2013, but there were only 30 since then and September 2013.

There have been 51 laboratory confirmed cases of measles so far in 2013, but only 3 in the last 3 months, the figures show. The HPS figures identified 3 clusters of cases, including one which occurred in a school, between April and June 2013 that contributed to the increase. HPS said the majority of cases were in unvaccinated or under-immunised individuals, those who have not received the recommended 2 doses of the MMR vaccine. The HPS report said: "The large increase in the number of cases seen in Scotland in weeks 9-24 has not continued into the current quarter. Clusters of cases and a high number of sporadic cases of unknown exposure origin are no longer being seen. Of the 51 cases so far in 2013, cases had a median age of 15 years. The majority of cases were unvaccinated or under-immunised (those who have not received the recommended 2 doses of MMR vaccine)."

Last year [2012], Public Health England reported the highest annual number of measles cases for the last 18 years with more than 2000 cases.

Chief Medical Officer Sir Harry Burns announced in May 2013 that older children would be offered a vaccination against measles following the outbreaks south of the border. Health boards in Scotland wrote to parents of unvaccinated children or those who are only partially protected to offer them the MMR vaccine or a booster shot.

Other figures released in the HPS report show that the number of confirmed cases of mumps so far this year [2013] has fallen to 211 compared to 405 for the same period last year [2012]. The report said mumps cases continue to occur steadily in Scotland among young adults who have not received 2 doses of MMR vaccine.

Public Health Wales (PHW) said it has received 2 notifications of measles in pupils at Cwmtawe School, with one case laboratory confirmed. It comes 3 months after Wales' biggest measles outbreak ended. The 1st cases in Swansea were reported last November [2012] before spreading to mid Wales. More than 75 000 were vaccinated during the outbreak throughout Wales. But experts say more than 30 000 children in the 10 to 18 age group still remain unvaccinated.

Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board is arranging for MMR vaccinations to be offered next week to all pupils at the school who are not fully vaccinated. Of 1260 pupils, 62 are recorded as having received no doses of the MMR vaccine, and 142 have received only one dose.

PHW communicable disease control consultant Dr Jorg Hoffmann said: "This case of measles comes only 3 months after the end of Wales' biggest ever measles outbreak. ... So we are obviously concerned and want to act quickly. We have written today to all parents of unvaccinated children in Cwmtawe School to urge them to arrange for their children to be vaccinated. In the meantime, to prevent the spread of infection, we would urge parents of any children who become unwell with measles-like symptoms over the weekend to keep them at home and seek medical advice and not to allow them to attend events where other children will be present."

By the time the outbreak was declared over after 6 months, it had resulted in 1219 notifications of measles cases in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg, Hywel Dda and Powys health board areas. Some 88 people visited a hospital due to measles during the outbreak. A 25-year-old man from Swansea died from pneumonia after contracting measles at the height of the epidemic.

[The Neath and Port Talbot areas are located in South Wales and Powis. Measles cases are recurring in both regions, and it is evident that although the emergency vaccination programmes have been comprehensive throughout Wales, a considerable number of school-age children remain unprotected.

Two doses of MMR are needed to provide the maximum 99 percent protection against measles, and Public Health Wales are aware of more than 30 000 children in the 10-18 age group who remain unvaccinated in Wales. Health officials are urging parents to make sure their children are vaccinated against measles after being notified of 3 more cases of the virus. Public Health Wales said there are now 3 cases associated with Cwmtawe School, Neath Port Talbot, one of which has been laboratory confirmed. Another 2 probable cases have been identified in children in Ysgol Y Cribarth, Powys who are connected to the confirmed case at Cwmtawe School. Tomorrow [8 Oct 2013], more than 200 children at Cwmtawe School will be offered the vaccination. Of 1260 pupils at the school, 62 are recorded as having received no doses of the MMR vaccine, and 142 have received only one dose. As the number of unvaccinated children at Ysgol Y Cribarth is so small, Powys Teaching Health Board is making arrangements for susceptible children to be immunised individually.

Lahore High Court (LHC) on Wednesday [9 Oct 2013] lashed out [at] the Punjab government for its continued failure in submitting an inquiry report prepared by a 3-member committee headed by Dr Zafar Iqbal, Principal Sheikh Zayed Hospital, into the alleged failure of the government to control the recent outbreak of measles, Geo News reported.

While hearing the measles case here, the court, expressing its extreme displeasure over non-submission of the measles inquiry report, observed that people were dying of measles while the Punjab Chief Minister, untouched by the tragedy, [is] sitting with the report.

The Additional Advocate General told the court that the report was lying with the Chief Minister, and Justice Khalid Mahmood observed that the people were dying and the Chief Minster was unmoved and was sitting with the report. He further said that the CM takes his salary from the national exchequer, and the welfare of the nation was his prime duty.

Justice Khalid Mahmood ordered the submission of the inquiry report within 3 days and later adjourned the hearing of the case until 14 Oct 2013.

Prior to the use of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccination, hundreds of those infected with measles died yearly, tens of thousands were hospitalized, and around 1000 cases resulted in chronic disability. Decades later, after believing that endemic transmission of this highly contagious illness had been eradicated in the United States in 2000, cases are on the rise again, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

"It is heartbreaking to watch something happen that is completely preventable," said David Kimberlin, M.D., University of Alabama at Birmingham professor of pediatrics and the American Academy of Pediatrics' liaison to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.

"This would not be happening if people trusted us and got their measles vaccinations," said Kimberlin, who sees patients at Children's of Alabama. "Someone eventually will die from measles, leaving many asking why it couldn't have been prevented, but it can be."

Kimberlin said measles cases are making it into the United States through international travelers but that it is finding fertile ground in communities because of the percentage of people in those communities who are not vaccinated against measles. The CDC reports 159 cases between 1 Jan and 24 Aug 2013, with 82 percent of the cases in unvaccinated persons and 9 percent with unknown vaccination status. 99 percent of the cases were import-related.

"It is like tossing a lit match on dry grass," Kimberlin said. "The message to take home from this is quite simple: Get vaccinated against all vaccine-preventable diseases and be protected from them, or do not get vaccinated and run the very real risk of getting those diseases and possibly dying."

Bali holidaymakers have been warned to watch for measles symptoms after 4 West Australian (WA) travellers contracted the disease in the past week after returning from Indonesia. The WA Health Department Director of Communicable Disease Control, Paul Armstrong, said people were also potentially exposed to infection at general practice surgeries where the infected cases were seen.

He said other risk areas were pathology collection centres and emergency departments at Royal Perth, Sir Charles Gairdner and Armadale-Kelmscott hospitals. One case was contracted while working on Barrow Island in the state's north, he said.

Measles is highly infectious and is spread by airborne respiratory droplets. It is contagious for up to 5 days before the rash and for 4 days after it starts.

"Individuals who have returned from Bali or think they may have been exposed and who develop symptoms of measles should stay away from others and promptly consult their doctor," Dr Armstrong said. "A person is considered immune to measles if they have received 2 doses of the measles mumps rubella (MMR) vaccine or were born before 1966."

Dr Armstrong said the incident was a reminder of the importance of adults being fully vaccinated against measles and other infectious diseases, especially before travelling overseas.
