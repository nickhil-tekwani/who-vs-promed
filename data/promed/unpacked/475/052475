Severe COVID and similar illnesses may raise risk for psychiatric disorders
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A new study shows that the more than 32 000 survivors of severe COVID-19 and more than 16 000 survivors of other severe respiratory infections studied in England were at significantly higher risk than the general population for new anxiety disorders, dementia, psychosis, bipolar disorder, and new neuropsychiatric drug prescriptions in the 1st year after hospital release.

In the observational study, published today in JAMA Psychiatry [see reference below], a team led by University of Oxford researchers analyzed data from all 8.38 million adults registered in national databases from 24 Jan 2020 to 7 Jul 2021.

Risk of new psychiatric prescriptions
-------------------------------------
Relative to the general population, the 32 525 survivors of COVID-19 and 16 679 survivors of other severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) were at higher risk for subsequent diagnosis of neuropsychiatric illnesses, the investigators found, but they noted that the absolute risks were low.

The hazard ratio [HR] for anxiety in SARI survivors was 1.86 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.56-2.21) and 2.36 (95% CI, 2.03-2.74) for COVID-19 survivors. The HR for dementia was 2.55 (95% CI, 2.17-3.00) for SARI survivors and 2.63 (95% CI, 2.21-3.14) for those diagnosed as having COVID-19.

In an analysis limited to SARI survivors as the reference group and COVID-19 as the comparator group, there were no significant differences in rates of newly diagnosed anxiety disorder (adjusted HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.79-1.27), dementia (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.69-1.13), depression (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.25-1.58), or bipolar disorder (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.32-1.69).

Nor did the 2 groups differ in their posthospitalization risk of new prescriptions for antidepressants (adjusted HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.90-1.27) or hypnotic or anti-anxiety medication (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.80-1.24). But COVID-19 survivors had a 20% lower risk of a first antipsychotic prescription than SARI survivors did (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.69-0.92).

Findings for all neuropsychiatric medications analyzed were similar. The adjusted HR for new prescriptions of antidepressants for SARI survivors was 2.55 (95% CI, 2.24-2.90), compared with 3.24 (95% CI, 2.91-3.61) for COVID-19 survivors.

The HR for new hypnotic or anti-anxiety drug prescriptions was 3.10 (95% CI, 2.74-3.51) for SARI survivors and 3.79 (95% CI, 3.38-4.25) for COVID-19 survivors, while the HR for new antipsychotic drug prescriptions was 4.64 (95% CI, 4.20-5.12) for SARI survivors and 4.78 (95% CI, 4.28-5.33) for those with COVID-19.

Direct comparison of the COVID-19 and SARI groups revealed no significant differences other than a lower risk for antipsychotic prescriptions in the former (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.69-0.92).
Role of disease severity

Although the relative risks of these outcomes in survivors of severe COVID-19 and SARI hospitalization were significantly higher than for the general population, the absolute risks were low, the study authors noted.

"Although post-COVID-19 syndrome is of legitimate topical interest in the current context of uncertainty regarding optimal support for survivors of COVID-19, our results suggest that from the perspective of formally diagnosed or treated neuropsychiatric complications, severe COVID-19 does not predicate markedly different morbidity rates than other forms of SARI," the researchers wrote.

The elevated risks of neuropsychiatric conditions among both SARI and COVID-19 survivors could result from physiologic alterations, physical deconditioning, and other infection-related stressors, they said.

Ultimately, they said, the findings suggest that disease severity -- not the causative pathogen -- has a role in neuropsychiatric disorders after severe respiratory infections. "These results may help refine our understanding of the post severe COVID-19 phenotype and may inform post discharge support for patients requiring hospital-based and intensive care for SARI regardless of causative pathogen," they concluded.

[2] North Korea: 1st report
Date: Thu 12 May 2022 15:35 GMT
Source: CNN [edited]

North Korea has identified its 1st ever case of COVID-19, according to state media, which called the situation a "major national emergency."

It's unclear how many infections have been detected, but state-run news agency KCNA reported on Thursday [12 May 2022] that cases of the omicron variant had been found in the capital Pyongyang.

Samples collected from a group of people experiencing fevers on 8 May [2022] tested positive for the highly contagious omicron variant, KCNA reported.

An outbreak of COVID-19 could prove dire for North Korea. The country's dilapidated health-care infrastructure is unlikely to be up to the task of treating a large number of patients with a highly infectious disease.

North Korea had not previously acknowledged any coronavirus cases, though few believe that a country of around 25 million people has been spared by a virus that has infected millions worldwide.

On Thursday [12 May 2022], North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered lockdown measures in all cities and directed the distribution of medical supplies the party had reportedly stocked in case of a COVID emergency, according to KCNA.

Kim also chaired a meeting of the country's powerful politburo, which agreed to implement "maximum" emergency anti-epidemic measures, though it is unclear what they involve.

According to KCNA, the politburo criticized the country's anti-epidemic sector for "carelessness, laxity, irresponsibility, and incompetence," saying it "failed to respond sensitively" to increasing COVID-19 cases across the world, including in neighboring regions.

Kim said the country would overcome the "unexpected COVID-19 outbreak," KCNA reported.

To date [12 May 2022], North Korea has been able to prevent a major outbreak of COVID-19 cases, thanks to a series of draconian public health measures.

North Korea's borders have been sealed since January 2020 to keep the virus at bay, despite the knock-on effects on trade with Beijing, an economic lifeline the impoverished country needs to keep its people from going hungry.

Isolated and impoverished North Korea is not known to have imported any coronavirus vaccines, though it is eligible for the global COVID-19 vaccine-sharing program, COVAX [COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access]. In February [2022], COVAX reportedly scaled back the number of doses allocated to North Korea because the country failed to arrange for any shipments, according to Reuters.

Also in February [2022], the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in North Korea, Tom√°s Ojea Quintana, called on the international community to provide North Korea "with 60 million doses of vaccinations to cover at least 2 shots of the entire population."

North Korea has also not provided information on its COVID-19 vaccination situation to the World Health Organization (WHO), according to its latest situation report.

Assuming most of North Korea's population is unvaccinated, a COVID outbreak would be disastrous.

In the US earlier this year [2022], omicron fueled an unprecedented spike in COVID-19 cases, overwhelming hospitals with mostly unvaccinated patients. In Hong Kong, which had previously avoided high cases and deaths, a deadly omicron wave quickly spun out of control, stretching morgues and hospitals to breaking point. At one stage, Hong Kong reported more deaths per million people than any country or territory in the world due to a large percentage of the city's elderly being unvaccinated.

But the US and Hong Kong have robust health systems. An outbreak in North Korea, which has limited testing capabilities and inadequate medical infrastructure, and which has isolated itself from the outside world, could quickly become deadly.

The prospect appears not to be lost on Kim Jong Un, who recently warned of "grave consequences" after he fired several senior officials who failed to enforce North Korea's stringent COVID-19 prevention. KCNA has also said that a potential breach, such as an incident involving a symptomatic defector from South Korea, might lead to a "deadly and destructive disaster."

"Kim Jong Un has also declared a state of emergency in all cities.
According to the North's official Korean Central News Agency, authorities determined that samples collected on [Sun 8 May 2022] from fever-ridden patients in Pyongyang were identical to omicron (KCNA).

"According to the report, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un vowed to overcome the "unexpected crisis."

"North Korea on [Thu 12 May 2022] reported its 1st outbreak of the coronavirus, declaring a "maximum emergency" and ordering all of its cities and counties to lock down to fight the spread."

On [Sun 8 May 2022], "health officials tested people in an unidentified organization in Pyongyang, the capital, who showed symptoms such as fever, and confirmed that they were infected with a subvariant, known as BA.2, of the omicron variant of the virus, the North's official Korean Central News Agency said. The news agency did not reveal how many people were infected."

The report was the 1st time that the secretive country has confirmed any COVID-19 cases since the virus emerged in neighboring China more than 2 years ago.

North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, "convened the Political Bureau of the ruling Workers' Party on Thursday [12 May 2022] to discuss the crisis, the news agency said."

[3] Subvariants
Date: Mon 9 May 2022

https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/what-we-know-about-all-the-omicron-subvariants.html


What we know about all the omicron subvariants including BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whether you're paying attention to the latest phase of the pandemic or not, the coronavirus is still evolving, and the subvariants are starting to add up. After 2 new variations of the omicron strain were recently detected in the United States, there are now at least 4 omicron subvariants circulating in the country. BA.2 is the still the most dominant and has driven the rise in cases across much of the US, but BA.2.12.1 appears to be even more transmissible, as do the newest strains, BA.4 and BA.5, which are expected to cause another wave of infection in South Africa. Below is a primer on everything omicron and what impact its sublineages may have.

All COVID is now a sublineage of omicron
----------------------------------------
With the delta variant effectively burned out in most of the world, the remaining variants all trace their lineage through omicron, as the Nextstrain tracker shows from 29 Apr 2022; (https://tinyurl.com/58ywxut5)

At this point, the original omicron strain known as BA.1 -- which caused the US to clock over 1 million confirmed cases in a single day in January [2022] -- has been overtaken by its successors, each of which has proven more transmissible than the original.

BA.2
----
First detected in the US in January [2022], the BA.2 subvariant quickly became the dominant strain in America, overtaking BA.1 by late March [2022], according to the CDC. Considered roughly 1.5 times more transmissible than the original, the variant -- known as "stealth omicron" for its difficulty to being differentiated in PCR tests -- caused a slight increase in confirmed COVID cases in early April [2022]. By mid-April, BA.2 represented close to 90 percent of new US cases. Thankfully, BA.2 does not appear to have caused another severe omicron wave, in part because of a level of protection for those previously infected with BA.1.

BA.2.12 and BA.2.12.1
---------------------
Two closely related subvariants, known as BA.2.12 and BA.2.12.1, recently began spreading in the US, making up around 29 percent of cases by late April [2022], according to the CDC. The strains were especially prominent in New York last month [April 2022], accounting for over 90 percent of cases amid a sizable outbreak in the central part of the state. BA.2.12.1 in particular has a mutation on the part of the spike protein of the virus that binds with human cells, making it around 25 percent more transmissible than BA.2, according to the CDC.

[See Eric Topol (3 May 2022 https://twitter.com/EricTopol)]

BA.4 and BA.5
-------------
Last month [April 2022], scientists in South Africa identified 2 new omicron sublineages, BA.4 and BA.5, which seem to be more infectious than BA.2, may be better equipped with immunity escape, and appear to be driving a surge of new cases in the country. Genomic surveillance has indicated that as of [20 Apr 2022], BA.4 and BA.5 made up more than 70 percent of new cases in South Africa. Experts there now expect a 5th COVID wave within weeks, even though an estimated 90 percent of the population is estimated to have some level of immunity to COVID from either vaccination or prior infection. Thus far, the surge in cases has not led to a surge in hospitalizations. And there is no evidence -- at least yet -- that the strains are likely to lead to more severe disease than previous strains.

That's the good news. What's worrisome about BA.4 and BA.5 is that preliminary data suggest the subvariants have mutations that, according to recent South African research, equip them with "extensive escape from neutralizing immunity elicited by previous infection with other variants, vaccines, or combinations of both." The researchers conclude that "based on neutralization escape, BA.4 and BA.5 have the potential to result in a new infection wave."

[See 28 Apr 2022 https://twitter.com/Tuliodna (abridged, edited):
"A rapid increase in infections in the last 2 weeks was due to BA.4 and BA.5. Albeit coming from a low number. The 6000 infections yesterday are underestimated as the test positivity ratio is around 20%. SA did not have a BA.2 Omicron wave-like Europe but only a large BA.1 wave."]

Small numbers of BA.4 and BA.5 cases have been detected in at least 20 other countries, including handfuls of cases of each strain in the US -- though there is no evidence they are circulating widely here yet. It's not clear whether other nations will face surges from the 2 strains as South Africa is experiencing.

Can you be infected with these subvariants if you already had omicron (BA.1)?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
That does appear to be possible with BA.4 and BA.5, based on early data from South Africa, and might be possible with the BA.2.12 lineages as well.

What about recombinant strains?
-------------------------------
Thankfully, recombinant strains of the virus -- think super-mutants combining the transmissibility of an omicron subvariant with the severity of delta -- have been rare. As computational biologist Cornelius Roemer explains, this is because "there was never much co-circulation of the 2 lineages. When BA.2 grew large, delta was already gone." (He does warn that the countries that did have co-circulation don't sequence the virus as frequently as in the US and Europe, "so even if recombinants existed, it would take a while until we see them in published sequences.")

In the United Kingdom, a "Frankenstein variant" combining BA.1 and BA.2 known as XE has been sequenced, with 1125 cases identified in the country by early April [2022]. And while cases have been reported in India and Japan, it does not appear to be significantly more transmissible than BA.2 and never took over as the dominant strain in the U.K. "It is the devil we know, so to speak," Case Western Reserve University immunologist Mark Cameron told CNBC. "Essentially a reshuffling of the same deck of cards."

Can we slow down the subvariant evolution?
------------------------------------------
Alpha, beta, delta, and several omicron variants have swept through the world, causing tens of millions of cases and millions of deaths since vaccines became widely available in many parts of the world. According to epidemiologist Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota and a member of the Biden administration's COVID-19 Advisory Board, the intense pace of change is directly related to the speed at which the novel virus has spread. "In the early days of the pandemic, remember there were many fewer people who were infected, and you have to be infected to drive the genetic changes of the virus," he says. "Kind of like compound interest, as more and more people got infected, more and more opportunities occurred for the virus to go through various mutations. That by itself helped drive it."

As for slowing the rate of evolving variants, the answer is as simple as it is hard to attain. "There is one way, and it's to stop transmission," says Osterholm. "If the virus is not reproducing itself, we wouldn't see nearly the same level of mutational changes."

[A] Mix-and-match mRNA COVID vaccines may offer more omicron protection

Researchers in Singapore discovered that a Moderna COVID booster following a 2-dose Pfizer vaccine series induced a stronger neutralizing antibody response against the Omicron variant in adults compared with an all-Pfizer series, according to a study today in Clinical Infectious Diseases [see reference below].

The randomized controlled trial included 100 healthy adults who had completed their initial vaccination series with Pfizer-BioNTech's mRNA vaccine, 6-9 months prior to this study. Participants were assigned to get either a Pfizer booster or a Moderna booster in about a 1:1 ratio. The primary endpoint of the study was the level of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 wild-type and variants of concern at day 28 post-booster.

Mean SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody titers were lower in the Pfizer-only group--22 382 international units per milliliter (IU/mL; 95% confidence interval [CI], 18 210-27 517), compared with 29 751 IU/mL in the Moderna group (95% CI, 25 281 - 35 011; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.034).

More significantly, the group with a Moderna booster had higher antibodies against variants of concern, including omicron. The median surrogate neutralizing antibody level against omicron in the all-Pfizer group was 72.8%, compared with 84.3% in the mixed-vaccine group.

Participants ages 60 and older showed a more robust immune response to mixing than younger participants, the authors said; in that group, 3 Pfizer doses offered 64.6% protection against omicron, compared to 89.2% for older adults who received a Moderna 3rd dose.

"For the vulnerable older age group, in particular, a heterologous booster COVID-19 vaccine regimen induces a higher anti-spike antibody titer and a stronger neutralizing antibody response against the highly infectious omicron variant (~20% higher neutralization) than a homologous booster regimen," the authors concluded.

Conclusions. Although the omicron variant exerts considerable humoral immune escape in BNT162b2 fully vaccinated individuals, a booster dose with BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 is capable of increasing the serum neutralizing activity against omicron by more than 50% by day 7 post-booster. In older individuals who received BNT162b2 as their primary vaccine series, a heterologous booster regimen with mRNA-1273 induced a higher anti-spike antibody titer and a stronger neutralizing response against the Omicron variant than a homologous booster regimen. - Mod.LK]

[B] Kids' odds of spreading COVID-19 in households rising with new variants

A systematic review and meta-analysis published today [11 May 2022] in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases [see reference below] suggests that while children account for less household COVID-19 transmission, their infectiousness appears to be on the rise as new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge.

Researchers from the National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders in China led the study, which involved searching the PubMed and EMBASE databases from inception to 20 Apr 2022. 48 studies were included for meta-analysis, and 47 were chosen for case analysis.

The pooled secondary attack rate (SAR) of pediatric index patients and household members was 0.20 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15-0.26) and 0.24 (95% CI, 0.18-0.30), respectively, in the meta-analysis. SAR refers to the likelihood of transmission to another person.

Child index cases had a 36% lower COVID-19 transmissibility risk than adults, and child contacts had a 26% lower risk (relative risk [RR], 0.64; 95% CI, 0.50-0.81 and RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.64-0.85, respectively). Younger and older children were equally vulnerable to infection (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.72-1.10).

Increased household SAR was seen in children throughout different variant periods (wild-type virus, 0.20; alpha, 0.42; delta, 0.35; and omicron, 0.56). The estimated SAR of adult household contacts was 0.32 (95% CI, 0.27-0.37) in 41 studies.

Older adults were significantly tied to a higher SAR than younger adults (RR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.24-1.70 for adults younger than 60; RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.02-1.50 for older adults).

In the case analysis, 10.3% of 78 family clusters were associated with an infected child, leading to 7.7% of 207 secondary cases, versus 92.3% of those linked with an infected adult. Pediatric infections were implicated in 29.8% of 282 household contacts and 60.3% of 78 family clusters. Secondary infections spread by children made up 30% of 207 secondary infections, compared with 70% for adults.

"Given the potentially serious complications of pediatric COVID-19, vaccination research and implementation in children remain a must," the researchers concluded.
