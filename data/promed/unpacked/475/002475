Presence of classical swine fever is ruled out in the Esmeraldas province
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Faced with the emergence of an alert about the existence of a possible outbreak of classical swine fever (CSF) in the San Lorenzo canton, the MAG ruled out said disease in the area.

A total of 24 samples were sent to the Agrocalidad laboratory where negative results were obtained and the presence of the virus (Classical Swine Fever) in the species was finally ruled out, assured the district directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG). The producers who were involved in San Lorenzo were visited and sanitary work was carried out. A total of 42 farms with 596 animals will be immunized over next few days in order to immunize pigs for the safety of producers.

Alert context
-------------
On 7 Sep 2022 the disease alert emerged in the aforementioned species, which forced Agrocalidad to intervene in the sector to rule out or verify said disease. So far there have been no more alerts in the other cantons making up the Esmeraldas province about the presence of classical swine fever.

Vaccination process
-------------------
The pig vaccination process continues in the province through the vaccination operators, of which there are 2 within Esmeraldas province: the Esmeraldas Provincial Cattlemen's Association and the Santo Domingo Pork Farmers' Association, who are divided into different zones. In addition, the cost of the vaccine is about USD 1.40. It is recommended pigs be vaccinated after 45 days of life and every 56 months to avoid dangerous viruses in animals.

In the green province, a vaccination goal of 745 000 animals has been established and 53 000 doses have already been applied so far. In San Lorenzo around 1531 animals have already been inoculated within the immunization process for pigs.

Brigades
--------
The brigades remain in the territories visiting the farms, and those animal breeders who require immunization in their animals can approach or request the classical swine fever vaccine, notifying the technicians of the MAG agency of the need, they in turn will notify the corresponding operator to proceed with the vaccine. Producers will receive a single vaccination certificate helping the farmer to move their pigs, they are also given an identification tag serving as a means of identification for the animals.

Prevention
----------
The vaccine is given to pigs is for prevention, however this classic swine disease has the ability to accelerate the presence of the virus as it is a highly contagious disease causing the death of animals and contaminates their meat if consumed by the population, which is why the controls are carried out in the province's slaughterhouses.

What is classical porcine plague?
---------------------------------
Classical swine fever (CSF) is a viral disease of pigs, highly contagious and of great economic impact. The severity of this disease varies with the virus strain, the age of the pig and the immune status of the herd.

[San Lorenzo Canton is a canton of Ecuador, located in the Esmeraldas Province. Its capital is the town of San Lorenzo.

This article is somewhat confusing. It begins by stating Classical Swine Fever (CSF) has been ruled out. Then it appears they are vaccinating to prevent CSF. It is unclear if this is CSF affecting these animals or if it could be ASF or African Swine Fever, which has recently been found in the Dominican Republic. Perhaps, Ecuador should test for ASF. There is some distance between these 2 countries. However, importation of the disease could happen inadvertently.

If there is further information ProMED would appreciate if you shared. - Mod.TG
