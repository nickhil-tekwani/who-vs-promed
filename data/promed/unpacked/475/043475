A debilitating skin condition of cattle that can cause a loss of
production and even death is spreading across the UK.

Psoroptic mange caused by the _Psoroptes_ sp mite has now been
confirmed on 23 farms, 18 of which are beef farms and 5 dairy.

It is a disease similar to that of sheep scab, said Alan Murphy of
the Animal Health Veterinary Laboratories Agency speaking at a Beef
Expo event in Newark.

Most cases have been concentrated in Wales, but the disease is
increasing, with cases confirmed in South West England and a heavily
suspicious case also likely in Lincolnshire, said Mr Murphy.

"This disease is spreading due to changes in husbandry and more
intensively managed stock. Most Welsh farms are shifting cattle for
finishing, and they are coming with extras. Biosecurity is key when
buying in animals, as buying in infected cattle is the principal means
of getting the disease, along with contact at markets and during
transport."

Psoroptic mange has also caused deaths in young stock in Germany due
to secondary infection, added Mr Murphy. "This disease is painful and
can not be underestimated. The UK has the opportunity now to say they
don't want it by looking out for symptoms, getting a diagnosis and
treating effectively."

Clinical signs of psoroptic mange are more severe in winter when the
mites cause a severe dermatitis with scab formation along the back,
shoulders and tail head of cattle, which also causes intense itching.
Secondary infection is common leading to bleeding and crusting of the
skin.

However, the problem could be more widespread than AHVLA [Animal
Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency, previously VLA] figures
suggest due to misdiagnosis. Mr Murphy said it can be easily mistaken
for lice. "Treating for lice may suppress some _Psoroptes_ mites, but
it won't treat it fully. That can then lead to chronic infection and
further spread. The majority of cases diagnosed have also failed to
respond to macrocyclic lactones, which is the licensed treatment for
psoroptic mange. So it is important farmers get a diagnosis, which
requires skin scrape so you can treat correctly, with help from their
vet."

[In 2009, UK's Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) [since 1 Apr 2011
renamed AHVLA] diagnosed psoroptic mange, caused by _Psoroptes_
species (sp.) mites in several cattle herds in Wales (no link with
sheep scab, caused by _Psoroptes ovis_). These were the 1st cases seen
in Great Britain since the 1980s, and it was suggested that the
infection had been imported from Europe. Since experience from other
European countries had shown that psoroptic mange may become the most
common skin disease in cattle, with consequently severe production
losses, and although not a notifiable disease, the VLA urged farmers
to inform any suspected cases. This was meant to enable the provision
of timely and updated advice on treatment and control to farmers and
to practitioners.

According to VLA's information, clinical signs are more commonly seen
in the autumn and winter. It may be difficult to spot disease in the
early stages or in the summer months when mite numbers are low and
clinical signs are minimal. All breeds of cattle are susceptible,
although disease can be particularly severe in British Blues. Most
cases were diagnosed in beef herds, but infection in dairy herds have
occurred.

Psoroptic mange does not affect humans.
