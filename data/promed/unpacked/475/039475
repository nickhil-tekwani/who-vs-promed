The rains and flooding in Gujarat have also led to an outbreak of
chikungunya across the state, especially in Ahmedabad. Chikungunya is a
relatively rare form of viral fever caused by bite of the _Aedes aegypti_
mosquito.
Ahmedabad Municipal Commissioner I.P. Gautam put the figure of such cases
at 2500. He said all 43 urban health centers in the city were assigned the
task of distributing chikungunya medicines. 62 mobile dispensaries have
also been allocated for the purpose. The corporation has also set up a
special round-the-clock control room, and around 1000 municipal workers are
carrying out a door-to-door survey and awareness campaign.

[2] Chikungunya - India

Chikungunya has been declared the epidemic of this season. This disease
seems to have overshadowed both malaria and dengue.
11 lakh [equal to 100 000] cases of the viral disease had been reported
from Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh,
Gujarat and Kerala in the last 2 years. In Tamil Nadu alone, 49 567 people
have been treated for chikungunya. The numbers of the disease transmitter,
the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, are 60 percent higher than last year [2005].
Swarms of mosquitoes seem to attack Chennai city. The breeding season has
begun in the entire state. According to public health officials, mosquito
breeding is unchecked after the 1st few rains, especially. The
dengue-chikungunya spreading mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ is multiplying in
unusually high numbers.
A study by this department shows that in a sample of 100 larvae, only one
or 2 larvae were of the usual malaria-causing _Anopheles_ mosquito variety.
_Aedes aegypti_ mosquito density is 60 percent higher than last year
[2005]. This makes chikungunya the epidemic of the season.
According to the report presented in the Assembly on 17 Aug [2006], 49 567
persons were treated for chikungunya in the entire State, while blood tests
confirmed 618 cases only. 3283 "suspected" cases of chikungunya have been
identified in the Chennai Corporation zone. Though the epidemic has
decreased, it seems to have overshadowed the other usually epidemic
diseases like malaria and dengue, say the health officials.
Chikungunya fever is a rare type of viral disease caused by an alphavirus.
The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito transmits this virus. Chikungunya is usually
not considered fatal. But 200 deaths were linked with this disease on
Reunion island in 2005-06.
High fever (101-104 F), headache, vomiting, depression, severe joint pains,
including wrists, knees and ankles, are the symptoms. A rash may appear on
the trunk and limbs after 2 or 3 days of onset of fever.
Recovery may take few days to few months. Though the fever comes down
abruptly in 2 days, joint pain, intense headache, insomnia and an great
degree of prostration lasts for a variable period.
Symptomatic treatment is recommended for chikungunya, and a serological
test is done.
Precautions:
Will fogging and using larvicides help? "Yes, but only temporarily," a top
public health official said. "It will only result in a transient reduction
of the number of mosquitoes. The permanent solution is to eliminate the
sources of breeding," which in the case of the _Aedes aegypti_ and
_Anopheles_ mosquitoes, is fresh, unpolluted water, he explained.
From water stored in buckets to open tanks, all pose a threat to become
the breeding area for mosquitoes. Hence, we should get rid of them.
"The _Aedes_ mosquito is like a pet dog. It only bites those who allow it
to breed. It does not travel very far, tries to find its meal in the
vicinity of its original breeding ground," explained the public health
official.
We need to keep ourselves fully covered during the daytime, as it is a
daytime mosquito that spreads the disease. Mosquito repellents will also be
useful.

[_Aedes aegypti_ as noted above is undoubtedly the vector of chikungunya
virus in the epidemic, but the statement that this mosquito is "60 percent
higher than last year" [2005] is rather ambiguous. It seems, however, to be
based on larval surveys, but the accuracy of this reported increase will
depend on sampling procedures and protocols and needs some statistical
reliance attached to it.
_Ae. aegypti_ larvae are mostly found in man-made container habitats, like
water storage containers, habitats which may also sometimes be colonized by
anopheline mosquitoes such as the malaria vector _Anopheles stephensi_.
However, most anopheline species, including important malaria vectors,
breed in waters not inhabited by _Ae. aegypti_. It should be noted that
_Ae. aegypti_ larvae can be found not only in relatively clean waters but
those that are contaminated (polluted) with organic debris, much of which
is a source of larval food.
Insecticidal fogging if undertaken efficiently should give immediate relief
from biting by adult mosquitoes in the treated areas, and might, if
sustained, curtail transmission of chikungunya virus. Larvicides can be
used to treat aquatic habitats colonized by _Ae. aegypti_, but to exert any
reduction on the adult mosquito population, there needs to be efficient
coverage of larval habitats in the area. I agree that more permanent
control requires most larval habitats to be eliminated, that is, source
reduction - Mod.MS]
[Chikungunya can no longer be considered a rare disease, given its spread
in the islands of the Indian Ocean and within India as well. It would be
interesting to know the measures that Ahmedabad health authorities are
taking to reduce the population of the vector, _Aedes aegypti_. A map of
