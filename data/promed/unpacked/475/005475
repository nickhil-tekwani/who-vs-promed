The 4th and 5th foci of bovine tuberculosis have been confirmed on [Wed 29 Nov and Fri 1 Dec 2017].

Focus 4 is a "beef cattle fattening establishment, in a cattle trader's exporting facility, West Flanders, including some 200 cattle.

Focus 5 is a "beef cattle fattening establishment, Limburg, with about 40 cattle.

The foci 2 to 5 have all been discovered in the context of the epidemiological investigation that had been started after the confirmation of the 1st focus in Antwerp province, at the end of Jul 2017. The fact that 2 of the infection foci were active in livestock trade has led to the incorporation of many establishments in the epidemiological investigation.

Between Jan and Sep 2017, 84 outbreaks of tuberculosis were detected on the national territory, of which 86 percent in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region. Despite many years of struggle and increased surveillance, infected areas in this region tend to grow and the number of outbreaks to increase.

The persistence of the disease in these areas undermines the maintenance of France's free status and jeopardizes the eradication of tuberculosis, which remain the priority objectives reaffirmed several times in Cnopsav , most recently on [Thu 12 Oct 2017].

Improving the health situation of the territory involves both strengthening surveillance and biosecurity measures. The national action plan against bovine tuberculosis is therefore under revision for the period 2017-2022.

With regard to surveillance, the exchanges with the actors in the field highlighted the difficulties to carry out the intra-dermal tuberculinations according to the [2015 guidelines] concerning the technical provisions relating to the detection of bovine tuberculosis on live animals.

These difficulties are in the 1st place practical, given the, at times, deficient restraint of the examined animals [when a single intradermal tuberculination, SDI, is applied, leading to non-specific results at a concerning rate].

The comparative intra-dermotuberculin test, CDI, has the advantage of increasing sensitivity without unduly degrading specificity.

The use of IDC has been made mandatory for all cattle over 24 months of herds subject to prophylaxis in the Dordogne, as well as for the other departments of New Aquitaine and for the Occitan region, for livestock classified at risk or located in the defined risk zones within the meaning of the ministerial decree of 7 Dec, 2016.

In order to disseminate good practice in implementing this demanding practice, the Ministry of Agriculture and Food has produced 2 videos for breeders and veterinarians (in French):

"Bovine tuberculosis: screening and diagnosis" at https://www.plateforme-esa.fr/tuberculose-bovine-depistage-et-diagnostic.

"Use and maintenance of the syringe lintock" at https://www.plateforme-esa.fr/utilisation-et-entretien-de-la-seringue-a-tuberculiner-mc-lintock.

These 2 videos are complemented by an information brochure on the implementation of the CDI, intended to be widely distributed.(In French, at https://tinyurl.com/ybw7ale8).

[Bovine tuberculosis is a chronic bacterial disease of animals and humans caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_. In a large number of countries bovine tuberculosis is a major infectious disease among cattle, other domesticated animals, and certain wildlife populations. Transmission to humans constitutes a public health problem.

Aerosol exposure to _M. bovis_ is considered to be the most frequent route of infection of cattle, but infection by ingestion of contaminated material also occurs. After infection, nonvascular nodular granulomas known as tubercles may develop. Characteristic tuberculous lesions occur most frequently in the lungs and the retropharyngeal, bronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes. Lesions can also be found in the mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, on serous membranes, and in other organs.

Bovine tuberculosis infection in cattle is usually diagnosed in the live animal on the basis of delayed hypersensitivity reactions. Infection is often subclinical; when present, clinical signs are not specifically distinctive and can include weakness, anorexia, emaciation, dyspnoea, enlargement of lymph nodes, and cough, particularly with advanced tuberculosis. After death, infection is diagnosed by necropsy and histopathological and bacteriological techniques. Rapid nucleic acid methodologies, such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), may also be used although these are demanding techniques and should only be used when appropriately validated. Traditional mycobacterial culture remains the gold standard method for routine confirmation of infection.
