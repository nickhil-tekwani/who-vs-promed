YELLOW FEVER - ANGOLA (UIGE, HUILA) (02): SUSPECTED

It is difficult to say what the etiologic agent of the current
outbreak in this part of Angola is, but I would like to suggest the
possibility of typhoid fever, given the reported cases of intestinal
perforation among some patients.
Two years ago, there was an epidemic of intestinal perforation due to
typhoid fever in Kinshasa [Democratic Republic of the Congo], with a
high case fatality rate. The strains of _Salmonella typhi_ isolated
from hospitalized patients were all resistant to chloramphenicol,
ampicillin, tetracycline and cotrimoxazol, but sensitive to
quinolones.
As you know, yellow fever never causes intestinal perforation.

[ProMED is grateful to Professor Muyembe for sharing his experience
with typhoid fever in Kinshasa, DRC with us and for reminding us that
intestinal perforations are not characteristic of yellow fever. This
is another example of the absolute need for laboratory diagnosis, and
the Angolan health authorities and Medecins Sans Frontieres
(MSF)-Switzerland are to be commended for having sent specimens to
reference laboratories promptly. - Mod.TY]
