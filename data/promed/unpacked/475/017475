-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Even though there is considerable confusion even within the scientific community, we would like to suggest the use of the term "bovine tuberculosis" to refer to the "infection in cattle with any of the disease-causing mycobacterial species within the _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ complex" (though of course _M. bovis_ is the most commonly found in most countries in the world) instead of the use that has been given in this post (and that is still present in many scientific and outreach publications), meaning "a chronic bacterial disease of animals and humans caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_" (irrespective of the host species).

Although this is the definition still used in the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2015 (Chapter 2.4.6 on Bovine Tuberculosis), the Terrestrial Manual also acknowledges the possible role of other _M. tuberculosis_ complex members as causative agents of animal ('bovine') tuberculosis, such as _M. caprae_. This would mean that according to their definition an infection with _M. caprae_ in a horse could still be named "bovine tuberculosis", which does not seem an appropriate use of the term.

We therefore propose reserving the term "bovine tuberculosis" for cases of animal tuberculosis in bovines irrespective of the _M. tuberculosis_ complex member involved, in line with the definition proposed by the bovine tuberculosis subgroup of the task force on monitoring animal disease eradication of the European Union in 2006 (SANCO/10200/2006, available at http://www.bovinetuberculosis.eu/data/wd/WD-SANCO-10200-2006_ERADICACION_BTB_IN_EU.pdf) and further elaborated in the "Working Document on causal agents of bovine tuberculosis" (SANCO/7059/2013, available at http://www.bovinetuberculosis.eu/data/wd/SANCO-7059-2013_M.tuberculosis_complex.pdf).

[ProMED-mail greatly appreciates Lucia de Juan Ferre's comments. The posted news report used the term "bovine tuberculosis" in reference to human disease due to _Mycobacterium bovis_. However, ProMED-mail had changed several years ago our use of the term "bovine tuberculosis" in our subject/title, so that it is now similar to the definition formulated in the "Working Document on causal agents of bovine tuberculosis" (SANCO/7059/2013, available at http://www.bovinetuberculosis.eu/data/wd/SANCO-7059-2013_M.tuberculosis_complex.pdf), namely, "infection in cattle with any of the disease-causing mycobacterial species within the _M. tuberculosis_ complex." - Mod.ML
