Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 18 [for locations and details see the OIE report at

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: illegal movement of
animals
Epidemiological comments: since the end of March 2011, and with
laboratory confirmation by the Disease Investigation Center in Maros,
the Gorontalo province is infected with HPAI. Since then, the disease
has spread in 4 districts of Gorontalo province: Gorontalo, Gorontalo
municipality, Boalemo, and Bone Bolango. Stamping out is the main
control measure for HPAI in the area. Movement control of poultry has
been done, especially using check points.

Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: Even though
HPAI has been declared endemic in the country by Indonesia in
September 2006, this report is published because it constitutes a
reoccurrence of the disease in Gorontalo province since June 2007.

Control measures
Measures applied: stamping out; movement control inside the country;
disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); no vaccination; no
treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Disease Investigation Center, Maros
(regional reference laboratory)
Tests and results
Species: birds
Test: polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
Test date: 30 Mar 2011
Result: positive

Future reporting

[This report, especially since it involves 18 separate small holder
premises, highlights the fact that H5N1 avian influenza in poultry is
still with us. This stubborn fact should remind us that as long as
this virus circulates, the dynamics of viral change can, at any time,
spawn a virus that does spread easily from human to human. As long as
this possibility remains patent, the H5N1 epidemic is not over. At its
height in 2006, over 60 countries were dealing with outbreaks of H5N1
influenza. All but 6 have been successful in eradicating the disease.
Unfortunately, after so many years of outbreaks, we have to conclude
that H5N1 is endemic in Egypt, India, Bangladesh, Viet Nam, China, and
Indonesia.

FAO has released a salient and insightful document entitled "FAO.
2011. Approaches to controlling, preventing and eliminating H5N1
Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in endemic countries. Animal
Production and Health Paper. No. 171. Rome," available at
http://www.fao.org/docrep/014/i2150e/i2150e.pdf. They detail several
structural problems in endemic countries that are inhibiting
eradication -- including the structure of the poultry industry in
terms of its rapid growth, complexity, and increasing demand. Another
factor is the unfortunate situation whereby the production and
marketing systems provide little protection from the influenza
viruses. Unfortunately, many birds do not show symptoms and the
support industries and services are not well developed. The veterinary
and livestock support services in endemic countries are weak and have
limited capability to identify and respond to infected farms. Finally,
the commitment of the poultry sector, government and public to
allocate sufficient resources is lacking. - Mod.PC]
