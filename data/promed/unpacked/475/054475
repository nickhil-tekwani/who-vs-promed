In the prefecture, about 657 cases of Oropouche fever have been reported
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Municipality of Mazagao (PMMZ) yesterday (4 [Aug 2009]) released
a report of around 657 cases of oropouche [virus] infection with
fever in the municipality in last 3 months. Of these, 29 were
[laboratory] confirmed by the Instituto Evandro Chagas (IEC). The IEC
found that the disease was caused by biting midges [_Culicoides_].

According to the secretary of health of Mazagao, Jose Monteiro, the
1st [disease] suspected was malaria followed by dengue, and only
afterward was oropouche diagnosed by the IEC. The disease has not
been reported in Amapa for a long time. The symptoms are very similar
to those of dengue and malaria: fever, headache, generalized myalgia.
Biting midges, common in the region, are one of the vectors of the virus.

The 1st cases of oropouche fever appeared in March 2009; in April and
May this year there was an tremendous increase of notifications, more
than 600, in Mazagao Velho and Carvao localities. We are taking
several steps, such as a service for cleaning and spraying in the
city, to eliminate the outbreak of the disease, said Jose Monteiro.

The oropouche virus is the 2nd most frequent cause of arbovirus fever
in Brazil. According to the Ministry of Health (MoH), about half a
million cases of fever have occurred in Brazil in the last 30 years,
there are records of events in Panama, Peru, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago.

Outbreaks of oropouche fever have been recorded only in the Amazon.
Global warming of the planet, deforestation and consequent
redistribution of insect vectors and animal reservoirs are some factors.

[Mazagao is located next to Manga, just to the southwest, near the
mouth of the Amazon River. Its population does not exceed 15 000
inhabitants, providing an incidence of 4380 fever cases per 100 000
inhabitants overall. Oropouche is a virus of the Bunyaviridae family.
It was isolated for the 1st time in 1960. It is transmitted by
_Culicoides spp_ and is one of the most common causes of
undifferentiated fever in northern and central-west Brazil. The
disease caused by the virus and essentially is benign, presenting no
great (health or mortality) risk. - Mod.LJS]

[Oropouche fever cases have also occurred in Peru, where it was
initially confused with dengue virus infections (see the ProMED
archive below). Some recent reports of oropouche virus infections in
