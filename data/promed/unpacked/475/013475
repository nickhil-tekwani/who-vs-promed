["Brucellosis in cattle and other Bovinae is primarily caused by _Brucella abortus_, a Gram-negative coccobacillus or short rod in the family Brucellaceae (class Alphaproteobacteria). 8 _B. abortus_ biovars (1-7, 9), including the recently reinstated biovar 7, are currently recognized. Other species of _Brucella_ that may be found in cattle include _B. melitensis_, which can be important in cattle in some countries, _B. suis_ and _B. canis_.

"Cattle, American bison (_Bison bison_), water buffalo, African buffalo, and elk are known reservoir hosts for _B. abortus_.

"Bovine brucellosis is often introduced into a herd in an infected animal. _B. abortus_-free herds should not be allowed to contact potentially infected animals or contaminated environments, such as those where animals recently aborted. Herd replacements should be seronegative and should come from brucellosis-free regions or herds. If such herds are unavailable in an endemic area, vaccinated calves or nonpregnant heifers are considered to be the safest option. Herd additions should be quarantined and re-tested before being released into the herd. Some infected animals, especially animals latently infected when they were young, might not be detected by either serology or culture. Semen for artificial insemination should only be collected from _Brucella_-negative animals that are tested regularly.

"In an infected herd, the placenta, any abortion products, and contaminated bedding should be removed promptly and destroyed. Where feasible, areas exposed to infected animals and their discharges should be cleaned and disinfected. The offspring of infected animals should not be used as herd replacements due to the risk that they may be latently infected. _B. abortus_ can be eradicated from a herd by test and removal procedures, or by depopulation. Programs to eradicate this organism from a country also include movement controls on infected herds, surveillance, and tracing of infected animals.

"Vaccines can help control the clinical signs in infected herds. They have also been used to reduce the prevalence of _B. abortus_ during eradication campaigns. Strain 19 and RB51 vaccines are generally used, although other vaccines (such as the strain 82 and 75/79-AB _B. abortus_ vaccines in Russia, and the S2 _B. suis_ vaccine in China) are employed in some areas.

"_B. abortus_ is zoonotic. The live attenuated organisms in strain 19 and RB51 vaccines are also pathogenic for humans; however, RB51 appears to be safer than strain 19."
