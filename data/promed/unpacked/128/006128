Case report
-----------
In June 2006, an 18-month-old girl living in southern Denmark was
admitted to hospital following a bat bite. The girl had been playing
on her own in front of the family farm, when she was found crying,
and with a bat attached by the mouth to one of her hands. The bat was
removed and killed, and the girl's mother cleaned the wound
thoroughly with soap and water. The girl was referred to the nearest
paediatric medical service for management of the potential rabies
exposure. On examination in hospital, a pin prick-like wound was
found on the patient's right hand. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)
was started (human rabies immunoglobulin was administered and a
course of rabies vaccination was begun).
During the summer, the patient's parents had noticed several bats
lying on the ground around the farm, unable to fly, but they had not
previously reported this. Because the dead bat that bit the child had
been crushed, it was not possible to test brain tissue for rabies
virus. Nine dead bats were then collected from the farm and tested at
the Danish Institute for Food and Veterinary Research. Of these 9
bats, 4 tested positive for a bat variant of rabies virus, European
Bat Lyssavirus (EBLV). The species of the bats is not known.
Rabies in bats in Denmark
-------------------------
Since 1996, the Danish Institute for Food and Veterinary Research has
analysed between 2 and 88 bats per year (Table 1), and between 0 and
11 bats per year have been found to be positive for EBLV. During the
same time period, between 4 and 18 people have been treated with PEP
after bat exposure each year in Denmark (Table 1). Where possible,
the bats connected with exposure are tested, but often bats are not
captured after their contact with humans, and therefore in most
cases, the bats tested are from other sources. Of the total number of
bats examined during this period in connection with human exposure,
58 percent were positive for EBLV.

Rabies prophylaxis after exposure
---------------------------------
In Denmark, PEP is usually only considered after bat bites, although
other animal bites are considered if the animals are suspected of
having rabies. Danish recommendations state that rabies
immunoglobulin should be given concurrently with, or within 8 days
after, the initial vaccination (1).
After bat bites, a total of 6 vaccinations are given on days 0, 3, 7,
14, 28 and 90, as a particularly high level of antibodies is required
for protection against the European Bat Lyssavirus (1,2). After
exposure to other suspect animals, the number of vaccinations given
is 5. The treatment regime is the same for children and adults.
Comments
--------
The proportion of bats that test positive for rabies virus in Denmark
has varied over time, as shown in the table [simulated above]. The
submission of bats for testing is a mixture of bats that have been
killed after incidents with human exposure and other bats, and
therefore the proportion found to have rabies may be different from
the actual prevalence in Denmark. However, the data indicate that
EBLV is quite common in Danish bats. In Denmark, no cases of rabies
have occurred in people who have been treated with PEP following bat bites.

[These data reveal the extent of rabies virus infection in bats in
Denmark, but are less informative than they might have been since no
attempt has been made to discriminate between the 2 European bat
lyssaviruses (EBLV-1 and EBLV-2). Limited surveillance suggests that
EBLV-1 and ELV-2 have different distributions in Europe [e.g. see
ProMED-mail references below).
Rabies virus, the causative agent of classical rabies, is the type
species of the genus Lyssavirus. Six other species are now
recognized: Mokola virus, Lagos bat virus, Duvenhage virus, European
bat lyssavirus 1, European bat lyssavirus 2 , and Australian bat
lyssavirus. The first 5 rabies-related species are restricted to the
Old World, whereas the 6th, a new lyssavirus isolated from
fruit-eating bats in 1996, is restricted to Australia, an island
country considered to be rabies-free for more than 100 years.
Bats are vectors for 6 of the 7 species and are the exclusive vector
for 5 of the 7 species. Rabies virus is the only one of these viruses
whose primary hosts are terrestrial vectors (mainly carnivores). The
species Rabies virus has spread worldwide in domesticated and wild
animals, whereas the other 6 species have narrower geographic and
host range distributions (and so far are confined to the Old world
and Australia) The 7 species of lyssaviruses are related by N and G
gene phylogeny, and by serology. The Danish surveillance data confirm
that post-exposure treatment with classical rabies virus vaccine and
immunoglobulin protects the recipients of bat bites from neurological
damage and ultimate death from the disease. - Mod.CP]
