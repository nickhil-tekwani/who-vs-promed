[1] Chikungunya

Now adding to its woes, chikungunya [virus infection] has made a
comeback in the national capital. The city reported 6 new cases of the
viral disease on Wednesday [22 Sep 2010], taking the total number of
cases in Delhi to 8. As per the report released by the Municipal
Corporation of Delhi (MCD), the figure last year was nil. According
to health department officials, the vector which carries dengue is
also responsible for spreading chikungunya.

The cases were reported from the Palam area in outer Delhi. They were
initially reported to Public Health Centre Palam. A medical team from
Lady Hardinge Medical College (LHMC) took the samples and found them
to be positive.

MCD has deployed a number of specialists to find the source of the
disease. "We have deputed a team of entomologists and epidemiologists
to find the source of infection. They will take appropriate action to
check breeding of mosquitoes and elimination of adult mosquitoes in
the area. Chikungunya [virus] is also spread by the vector _Aedes_.
But the virus is different from dengue," said Dr V K Monga, chairman
MCD.

[The transmission of chikungunya virus in Delhi, along with dengue
virus, is not surprising. India is endemic for both viruses, and
apparently Delhi has an abundance of _Aedes_ mosquito vectors, which
are transmitting both viruses. Since there is no commercially
available vaccine for either of the viruses, the only feasible control
measure is vector control, with emphasis on eliminating breeding sites
in and around buildings. The appearance of chikungunya virus
infections is not good news for the upcoming Commonwealth Games, which
is suffering infrastructure problems as well.

[2] Dengue

With just 5 days left for the Commonwealth Games in Delhi, the city
continued to grapple with a dengue outbreak as cases of the
vector-borne disease reached 3013 after 97 more patients tested
positive. The capital has reported 5 dengue deaths this season. South
Delhi continued to be worst-affected this season recording 437 cases,
followed by MCD Civil Lines Zone (392), Rohini (354) and Central Zone
(337). The civic bodies are attributing the rapid increase in dengue
cases this season to prolonged monsoon and stagnation of water at
Commonwealth Games construction sites.

The dengue outbreak has also raised concern among several countries
which are sending teams to participate in the Games to be held here
next month [October 2010]. India has issued a health advisory for
participants and visitors coming for the event asking them to take
precautions like carrying full-sleeve clothes and bringing mosquito
repellent creams, oils, mats or coils. The government yesterday sought
to play down concerns over dengue during the Games saying the
prevalent variant of the mosquito-borne disease was not very
dangerous. "Dengue count in the country is still low. The type of
vector-borne disease [virus] is subtype 3, which is not very
dangerous," Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad had said.

[The current outbreak was 1st reported in mid-July 2010 and has been
steadily increasing ever since. Declaring that dengue virus 3 is "not
very dangerous" is not supported by the facts. The hospitalized cases
and the families of the 5 fatal cases in Delhi would certainly not
agree with that statement. The dengue virus 3 Asian subtype has been
especially virulent in South and Central America, although its genetic
relationship to the dengue virus 3 currently circulating is Delhi is
not known. - Mod.TY]
