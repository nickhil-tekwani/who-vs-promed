[The background and events leading to the discovery of this novel
arenavirus associated with an outbreak of lethal hemorrhagic fever in
Southern Africa in 2008 have been described previously in the
ProMED-mail archived reports listed below. The publication in the
current issue of PLoS Pathogens describes the characterisation of this
novel pathogen.

This paper demonstrates the power of pyrosequencing for the rapid
identification of new pathogens. In this instance, sequences were
obtained within 72 hours of receipt of clinical specimens. Lujo virus
appears to be highly lethal in humans, based on the deaths of 4 out of
5 of the infected patients. Now that the sequence of Lujo virus is
known, reagents can be produced which will enable rapid identification
of new cases by more conventional diagnostic approaches such as RT-PCR
(reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction). Lujo is a new
member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and is genetically distinct from
other Old and New World arenaviruses.

The species name Lujo virus proposed by the authors has not yet been
approved by the ICTV (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses).

Abstract
--------
Lujo virus (LUJV), a new member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and the
1st hemorrhagic fever-associated arenavirus from the Old World
discovered in 3 decades, was isolated in South Africa during an
outbreak of human disease characterized by nosocomial transmission and
an unprecedented high case fatality rate of 80 percent (4/5 cases).
Unbiased pyrosequencing of RNA extracts from serum and tissues of
outbreak victims enabled identification and detailed phylogenetic
characterization within 72 hours of sample receipt. Full genome
analyses of LUJV showed it to be unique and branching off the
ancestral node of the Old World arenaviruses. The virus G1
glycoprotein sequence was highly diverse and almost equidistant from
that of other Old World and New World arenaviruses, consistent with a
potential distinctive receptor tropism. LUJV is a novel, genetically
distinct, highly pathogenic arenavirus.

Author Summary
--------------
In September and October 2008, 5 cases of undiagnosed hemorrhagic
fever, 4 of them fatal, were recognized in South Africa after air
transfer of a critically ill index case from Zambia. Serum and tissue
samples from victims were subjected to unbiased pyrosequencing,
yielding within 72 hours of sample receipt multiple discrete sequence
fragments that represented approximately 50 percent of a prototypic
arenavirus genome. Thereafter, a full genome sequence was generated by
PCR amplification of intervening fragments using specific primers
complementary to the sequence obtained by pyrosequencing and a
universal primer targeting the conserved arenaviral termini.
Phylogenetic analyses confirmed the presence of a new member of the
family _Arenaviridae_, provisionally named Lujo virus (LUJV) in
recognition of its geographic origin (Lusaka, Zambia, and
Johannesburg, South Africa). Our findings enable the development of
specific reagents to further investigate the reservoir, geographic
distribution, and unusual pathogenicity of LUJV and confirm the
utility of unbiased high throughput pyrosequencing for pathogen
discovery and public health.
