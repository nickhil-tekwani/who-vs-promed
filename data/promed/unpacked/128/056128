The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned the public against a counterfeit rabies vaccine that is being sold in the country.

The FDA and Novartis Healthcare (Philippines) have "determined that there is an illegally imported and unregistered Purified Chick Embryo Cell (Rabipur) Rabies Vaccine being offered for sale in vaccination clinics, drug establishments and outlets, and internet websites."

A complaint sample of the vaccine was collected at Tabuk City in Kalinga, and it was verified that the sample was counterfeit.

The rabies vaccine is administered to people who are at high risk of exposure to rabies or to someone who has been exposed to rabies, the FDA said. Vaccines are sensitive biological substances that can lose their potency and effectiveness if they are exposed to temperatures outside the temperature range of 2-8 C [35-46 F], the agency added. "Proper handling and storage should be exercised to assure the product's safety, efficacy, and quality. However, there is no assurance of safety, efficacy, and quality of counterfeit vaccines," the FDA said.

All drug establishments and outlets have been warned against importing, distributing, and selling this unregistered drug product.

[Tabuk is a city and the capital of the province of Kalinga in the Philippines. According to census figures obtained in 2007, it has a population of 87 912 people. Its location can be found in the maps at: http://en.wikipeia.org/wiki/Tabuk,_Philippines.

Canine rabies is widespread throughout the Philippines, and administration of rabies virus vaccine is a life-saving treatment for humans bitten or injured in encounters with rabid animals. It is not clear from this report whether the counterfeit vaccine is an unauthorised product or a genuine vaccine that has exceeded its expiry date. Whatever the reason, it should be avoided and destroyed if identified. Travellers to the Philippines as well as residents should be made aware of the hazard. - Mod.CP
