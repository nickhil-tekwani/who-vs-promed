Dr. Rosenberg suggests that the WHO posting on 1 May 1997 [(see Lassa fever
- Sierra Leone (06)] be amended to say that special isolation precautions
"... reinforce the misperception that hemorrhagic fever viruses are
transmissible to a greater extent than other bloodborne viruses."
Without in any way diminishing the importance and demonstrated efficacy of
barrier nursing practices against nosocomial transmission of viral
hemorrhagic fevers (VHF) (see MMWR 37(S-3):1-16, 1988), let me aver that Dr.
Rosenberg seems to overlook the very definite capability of filoviruses,
Congo-Crimean Hemmorhagic Fever virus, and also Lassa fever virus for
aerosol nosocomial transmission. The references cited below describe
scenarios of aerosol transmission unheard of for "other bloodborne viruses"
such as hepatitis B virus, and are enough to put healthy fear into any
person dealing with these particular agents of VHF. Although it is difficult
to precisely quantitate the magnitude of this risk, and despite the fact
that barrier nursing will eliminate the majority of nosocomial transmission
risk, the potential for aerosol transmission not precluded by such practices
is nevertheless finite and
real.
It is granted that the implementation of "special isolation precautions"
(e.g. negative-pressure room, HEPA respirators as per MMWR 44(25):475-479,
1995) requires perspicacious judgment, and resources which, although not
extraordinary, are infrequently available in the third world.
