Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever - Brazil (Minas Gerais) 970903122901

A warm winter and wet spring mean ticks in Indiana, and for the first time
in 12 years, that has meant death by Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
A South Bend-area 3-year-old and a Jamestown man apparently have died of
the tick-borne illness recently, and a 3-year-old Indianapolis boy is
fighting for his life. Each had been bitten by a tick carrying the disease.
The last previous death in Indiana from Rocky Mountain spotted fever was in
1988, though state health officials said they see an average of seven cases
a year.
Early last week, doctors confirmed that a 3-year-old from the South Bend
area, died of Rocky Mountain spotted fever on June 5. He lived just over
the state line in Michigan.
The ordeal of [a second 3-year-old, hospitalized since May, began when his
parents found a tick on his head.
[A 29-year-old man from Jamestown, was treated for the disease on 4 Jul
2000, his widow said, and died Sunday [presumably 16 Jul 2000. An autopsy
is pending, but the family blames Rocky Mountain spotted fever.

[It would be of interest to know whether the total number of cases is
tracking toward a higher number than 7 for this year. This article
describes only the patients who succumbed. Rocky Mountain Spotted fever is
caused by _Rickettsia rickettsii_. It would be of interest to know the
relevant tick vector(s) in the Indiana area. - Mod.ES
