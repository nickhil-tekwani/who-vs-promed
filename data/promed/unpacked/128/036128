France's agriculture minister Stephane Le Foll announced that a coffee plant infected with _Xylella fastidiosa_ had been identified at the Rungis wholesale market, Paris.

Xylella can attack grape vines but there are several strains of the bacteria, which do not necessarily cross over. It appears to have been introduced to Italy in 2013 from an ornamental coffee plant, which came through the port of Rotterdam from Costa Rica. Since then thousands of acres of olive groves have been affected and the European Commission has urged the country to cut down all infected trees.

The infected plant found in France marks the 1st appearance of the bacteria in Europe outside Italy. French inspectors found no trace of the insects that transmit the bacteria on or around the plant at Rungis. Earlier [in April 2015] France introduced a ban on plants coming from xylella-infected areas.

[_Xylella fastidiosa_ (Xf) clogs the xylem in infected plants, causing wilting, necrosis and often death of the host. It has been reported from a number of crops causing very serious diseases such as Pierce's disease of grapevine; leaf scorch of coffee, almond and olive; phony disease of peach; leaf scald of plum; variegated chlorosis of citrus; lucerne dwarf; as well as leaf scorch of elm, oak, plane, mulberry, maple, oleander and other woody ornamentals. Latent infections of a number of wild species have also been reported and these may serve as pathogen reservoirs. While all strains of _Xylella_ have been classified into a single species, there are different pathotypes, most of which have not been characterised and compared with each other yet. Several subspecies have been proposed.

_X. fastidiosa_ is spread by xylem-feeding insect vectors including several species of sharpshooters (including _Carneocephala_, _Draeculacephala_, _Graphocephala_, and _Homalodisca_ species). It can also be spread by grafting and with infected plant material, but is not seedborne. Moist conditions favour the vectors and therefore Xf-associated diseases. Disease management is difficult due to the large numbers of potential reservoir hosts and vectors and may include use of clean planting and grafting material, as well as vector control.

The pathogen has been reported mainly from the Americas, but was recently confirmed for the 1st time in Asia, on grapevine in Taiwan (ProMED-mail post 20130806.1866205). It seems likely that the outbreak in Italy (ProMED-mail posts 20131101.2033095, 20140820.2708739 and 20140424.2425497) represents the 1st report of the pathogen in Europe. While a source of the European incursion is currently still unproven, suggestions that it was due to contaminated imports of plant material (as mentioned above) appear likely. The pathogen has been added to the quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO). Both the bacterium and its main vectors are of serious quarantine concern, especially outside of the Americas.

The Xf pathotype affecting oleander and almond has been found previously to also affect olives, but is currently not considered pathogenic on grapevines. The strain of Xf in olives in southern Italy has been reported to be identical to a variant infecting oleander in Costa Rica, but it is suggested above that both the Italian and French incursions originated from ornamental coffee plants. It must then be noted that closely related strains from coffee and citrus have been shown to induce symptoms similar to Pierce's disease when inoculated onto grapevine, although strains isolated from grapevines naturally infected with Pierce's disease are most distantly related to coffee and citrus strains in the diverse taxon (Li et al, Plant Dis. 86, 1206-1210; see link below). This indicates that a great deal more research is needed to determine host range and risks to crops of the spectrum of Xf strains.
