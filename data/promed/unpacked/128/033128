Feed suspected in deaths of 12 horses
-------------------------------------
12 Belgian draft horses died after eating feed that contained a drug that
helps cattle gain weight but is toxic to horses. The drug probably got into
the feed accidentally, said David Fredrickson, director of investigation
for the state Agricultural Resource Management Division.
He said the feed had been custom-made, so it was unlikely other batches
contained the drug, monensin. Fredrickson would not identify the company
that made the feed but said it was cooperating with the investigation.

[This article leads one to believe that the investigation is not complete
and that there are no laboratory results confirming the presence of
monensin. Monensin is in a class of chemicals known as ionophores.
Ionophores have a number of uses in cattle, including weight gain, but
generally are toxic to horses. - Mod.TG]
