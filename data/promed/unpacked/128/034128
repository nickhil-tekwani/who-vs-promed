At least 3 cases of Q fever have been confirmed among workers at the Biological Mechanical Treatment (TMB) plant located in the Bilbao area of Artigas, as this newspaper has learned. Two of the 3 affected have been hospitalized for several days at Galdakao and Cruces Hospitals, and a 4th employee is waiting for their infection to be confirmed, according to worker sources.

The Occupational Health and Safety committee met yesterday [Thu 25 Mar 2021] with the company to explain the situation without any decision being made at the moment. Union sources have assured this afternoon [Fri 26 Mar 2021] that they expect a visit from Osalan [the Basque Institute for Occupational Safety and Health] inspectors to the TMB plant shortly in light of the cases detected.

The new presence of Q fever among TMB employees follows a severe outbreak in 2014, which affected dozens of workers, forcing the plant to close until its complete disinfection.

Q fever is caused by the obligate intracellular pathogen, _Coxiella burnetii_. The disease is usually transmitted to people through either infected milk or through aerosols. This disease is found on most continents with the reported incidence probably much lower than the actual because so many cases are so mild. Animal reservoirs of _C. burnetii_ include sheep, cattle, goats, dogs, and cats. In areas where these animals are present, Q fever affects veterinarians, meatpacking workers, and farmers. Q fever is also considered a potential agent of bioterrorism.

According to the CDC, Q fever symptoms most commonly present as an unexplained febrile illness, sometimes accompanied by pneumonia and/or hepatitis. Illness onset typically occurs within 2-3 weeks after exposure. The mortality rate for acute Q fever is low (1-2%), and the majority of persons with mild illness recover spontaneously within a few weeks, although antibiotic treatment will shorten the duration of illness and lessen the risk of complications. Chronic Q fever is uncommon (less than 1% of acutely infected patients) but may cause life-threatening heart valve disease (endocarditis).

[ProMED posted an outbreak of Q fever at the Mechanical Biological Treatment Plant (TMB), a waste treatment facility, in 2018. TMB, located in a mountainous area on the western outskirts of the city of Bilbao, Spain, reportedly handled at the time the urban waste from the city of Bilbao. TMP was also the site of a prior Q fever outbreak in 2014. (See ProMED post Q fever - Spain: (PV) waste treatment facility 20180411.5739737). Previous Q fever outbreaks at this facility were said to have forced interruption of activity at the facility for several months to empty the pit and the tunnels to eradicate the bacterium _Coxiella burnetii_, the cause of Q fever.

_C. burnetii_ is an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterial pathogen. It is highly resistant to drying and heat, which enables the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment. Q fever is attributed to a small-cell variant of the organism that is part of a biphasic developmental cycle. Q fever is a zoonosis. Domestic ungulates such as sheep, cattle, and goats serve as the reservoir of infection for humans. The organism is shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta.

Humans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms. Acute symptoms of a flu-like illness usually develop within 2-3 weeks of exposure, although as many as half of humans infected with _C. burnetii_ do not show symptoms (http://www.cdc.gov/qfever/symptoms/index.html). Although most persons with acute Q fever infection recover, others may experience serious illness with complications that may include pneumonia, granulomatous hepatitis, endocarditis (especially in patients with previous cardiac valvulopathy), myocarditis, and central nervous system involvement. Pregnant women who are infected may be at risk for pre-term delivery or miscarriage.

Q fever is distributed worldwide, with the exception of New Zealand. Q fever is primarily an occupational hazard for farmers, veterinarians, and abattoir workers in contact with domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats and for laboratory personnel performing _C. burnetii_ cultures and working with _C. burnetii_-infected animals (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88923/). Sporadic cases occur in people living in urban areas that are downwind from farms or abattoirs where the organisms have become aerosolized. Occasional cases follow contact with farm animals or after contact with infected pets such as dogs and cats.

Q fever is diagnosed predominantly in northern Spain, especially in the Basque Country and Navarre provinces, supposedly because of the greater cattle-raising activities in these areas (Maurin M, Raoult D: Q Fever. Clin Microbiol Rev. 1999; 12(4): 518-553. Available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88923/). A large number of cases have been also diagnosed in the Madrid area. Q fever most often presents as pneumonia in the Basque region in northern Spain, where Q fever is said to be the 2nd-commonest cause of community-acquired pneumonia, whereas hepatitis is predominant in Andalusia in southern Spain. Most cases occur between March and July, corresponding to the peak in the lambing season.

The source of _C. burnetii_ for the current cases at the TMB is not specified in the news report above. Perhaps disturbance of soil contaminated with _C. burnetii_ during construction in this Q fever-endemic region of Spain is at fault. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Bilbao is located 16 km (10 mi) south of the Bay of Biscay. With a population of 345 141 residents as of 2015, it is the largest city in northern Spain; the Bilbao metropolitan area has about 1 million residents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilbao).
