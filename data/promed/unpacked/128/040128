Health officials with the Provincial Epidemiological Surveillance System are reporting 50 confirmed cases of leptospirosis in Santa Fe province during the 1st quarter of 2015, according to an El Litoral report.

Of the more than 500 febrile events that were investigated by the health department these 3 months, 50 were laboratory confirmed for the bacterial disease. "Most of them received outpatient treatment with a good outcome," a health ministry spokesperson said. However, 3 fatalities were reported: 1 each in Santa Fe, Chabas and in Rosario.

Health department officials advise the public to avoid contact with standing water, use appropriate protective measures when working in hazardous areas: boots and gloves, keep patios and gardens clean, weeding wastelands, cover the holes in the home where rodents can enter, remove trash and debris, condition them to not become a haven for rodents and place garbage in containers with tight lids.

Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that affects humans and animals. It is caused by bacteria of the genus _Leptospira_. The bacteria that cause leptospirosis are spread through the urine of infected animals, which can get into water or soil and can survive there for weeks to months.

In humans, it can cause a wide range of symptoms, some of which may be mistaken for other diseases. Some infected persons, however, may have no symptoms at all. Without treatment, leptospirosis can lead to kidney damage, meningitis (inflammation of the membrane around the brain and spinal cord), liver failure, respiratory distress, and even death.

[Clinical signs observed with leptospirosis vary from inapparent to fatal depending on the host and the serovar. Acute leptospirosis is evident initially by a fever that may persist from a few hours to several days. In humans the disease is characterized by fever, headaches, muscle aches, vomiting, conjunctivitis, weakness, meningitis, and in severe cases, icterus (jaundice) and kidney failure. In domestic species clinical signs consist of fever, weight loss, anorexia (loss of appetite), abnormal milk secretion, anemia, hematuria (blood in the urine), hemoglobinuria (hemoglobin in the urine), muscular weakness, pulmonary congestion, icterus, abortion (a few days to several weeks following infection of the fetus), stillbirths or persistent infection in newborns, and death. Naturally occurring leptospiral infection in wildlife is apparently self-limiting and asymptomatic, with the host recovering from the initial stages of the disease while remaining a reservoir host. Experimental infections in white-tailed deer resulted in clinical signs ranging from an inapparent infection to a febrile response, abortion, and death. Clinical signs observed in the experimental deer were a transient fever, anorexia, weakness, anemia, hemoglobinuria and icterus.

Pathological findings vary as much as the clinical signs of disease. In humans, pathological changes occur in the kidney parenchyma. In domestic species, the leptospirae cause hepatitis (cellular necrosis and separation of liver cord cells). Encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and nephritis (inflammation of the kidney) also occur. - Mod.LL
