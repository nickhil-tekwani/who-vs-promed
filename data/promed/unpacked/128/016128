The Kentucky State Veterinarian's office has announced that an Allen County horse has tested positive for West Nile virus (WNV), the 4th confirmed case in the commonwealth this year [2014].

In a statement Kentucky Equine Programs manager E.S. "Rusty" Ford relayed that the unvaccinated 10-year-old Quarter Horse gelding presented with a fever and mild hind limb ataxia on 26 Oct 2014. The horse's condition improved over the next 3 days, and he continues to recover.

A total of 12 WNV cases were reported last year [2013] in Kentucky horses. West Nile is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes.

Clinical signs for WNV include flu-like signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed; fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculations (twitching); hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound); changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they are daydreaming or "just not with it"; occasional somnolence (drowsiness); propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and "spinal" signs, including asymmetrical weakness. Some horses show asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia.

Equine mortality rate can be as high as 30-40 percent. The clinical signs of WNV can be consistent with other important neurologic diseases such as equine encephalitis, rabies, and equine herpesvirus; therefore it is important to work with your veterinarian to get an accurate diagnosis through laboratory testing.

Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot.

However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3 to 6 week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents.

[So many diseases are so easily preventable with a vaccination.

West Nile virus (WNV), like Eastern equine encephalitis, is preventable by a vaccine, as mentioned in the article. The 2 are usually in combination, so it is only a single injection to prevent these diseases. Admittedly, injection needs to be given an initial time and again about 21-30 days later. Then it should be given annually or every 6 months depending upon your location or the recommendation of your veterinarian.

WNV is the leading cause of arbovirus encephalitis in horses and humans in the United States. Since 1999, over 25 000 cases of WNV encephalitis have been reported in US horses. Horses represent 96.9 percent of all reported non-human mammalian cases of WNV disease.

This virus has been identified in all of the continental US, most of Canada and Mexico. Several Central and South American countries have also identified WNV within their borders. The virus is transmitted from avian reservoir hosts by mosquitoes (and infrequently by other bloodsucking insects) to horses, humans and a number of other mammals. WNV is transmitted by many different mosquito species and this varies geographically. The virus and mosquito host interactions result in regional change in virulence of the virus and no prediction can be made regarding future trends in local activity of the viruses. Horses and humans are considered to be dead-end hosts for WNV; the virus is not directly contagious from horse to horse or horse to human. Indirect transmission via mosquitoes from infected horses is highly unlikely as these horses do not circulate a significant amount of virus in their blood.

The case fatality rate for horses exhibiting clinical signs of WNV infection is approximately 33 percent. Data have supported that 40 percent of horses that survive the acute illness caused by WNV still exhibit residual effects, such as gait and behavioral abnormalities, 6 months post-diagnosis. Thus vaccination for WNV is recommended as a core vaccine and is an essential standard of care for all horses in North America.
