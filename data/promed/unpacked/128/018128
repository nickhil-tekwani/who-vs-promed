Onychomadesis in Michigan
-------------------------
[A correspondent who lives in Oxford, Michigan, has sent the
following interesting account of an association in her family between
nail loss and prior coxsackievirus infection. - Mod.CP]

"I was looking on the internet to find out why my daughter was losing
her nails and came across the 2 ProMED-mail reports [archive
references below] describing an association of nail loss and prior
coxsackievirus infection. My youngest daughter had coxsackievirus
infection approximately 2 months prior to the shedding of her nails.
An older daughter had the same condition approximately 3 years
earlier after recovering from coxsackievirus infection. My
pediatrician diagnosed classic hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) in both
cases.

The girls were both about 2 1/2 years old and their nails began to
come off about 45 days after the onset of the illness. Not all of
their nails came off. My older daughter lost about 75 percent of her
nails and toenails and my younger daughter, who currently has it,
[onychomadesis] has lost or is losing about 90 percent. Neither child
was treated with antibiotics because of the coxsackievirus diagnosis.
[Certain antibiotics may cause nail loss - Mod.JW]. No secondary
bacterial infection has erupted so in both cases they have never been
treated with antibiotics. I have a 3rd daughter who got the virus
around the same age (very mild case) and her nails stayed intact a
month later."

[Onychomadesis is complete nail shedding from the proximal portion.
It is consecutive to a nail matrix arrest and can affect both
fingernails and toenails. It is a rare disorder in children.

Except for serious generalised diseases or inherited forms, most
cases are considered to be idiopathic. Nail matrix arrest has been
associated with a variety of drug exposures and systemic illnesses,
including infections, and may result in a variety of changes,
including transverse ridging (Beau's lines) and nail shedding
(onychomadesis).

HFMD is a contagious enteroviral infection occurring primarily in
children and is characterised by a vesicular palmoplantar eruption
and erosive stomatitis. Recently ProMED-mail carried reports
(referenced below) of an extensive outbreak of onychomadesis in Spain
associated with coxsackievirus infection. Amy Moore's observations
appear to be another instance of an association between nail loss and
prior coxsackievirus infection.

The association of onychomadesis and prior enterovirus infection
deserves further investigation, particularly in relation to the
specificity of the agent concerned. According to the 8th Report of
the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses
(<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTVdb/Ictv/fr-fst-h.htm>) the
coxsackieviruses are spread over 3 distinct virus species: 13 are
classified in the species _Human enterovirus A_, 7 in _Human
enterovirus B_, and 9 in _Human enterovirus C_ -- which also includes
enterovirus 71, the virus responsible for the HFMD currently
afflicting several Asian countries. Additional information from any
other source would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
