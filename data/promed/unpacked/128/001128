The Chilean Fishing and Aquaculture Service (Sernapesca) confirmed the detection of an outbreak of infectious salmon anemia (ISA) in a hatchery of Aysen [Aisen] region, for which a stringent control procedure was established.

Juan Luis Ansoleaga, Director of Sernapesca, stated on 4 Apr 2013 that in accordance with the protocols of the ISA control and surveillance program "we were informed by the company Los Fiordos about the detection of clinical signs of ISA in fish of one cage at Garrao center, in Aysen region."

Strict biosafety and control measures were immediately activated. "On Fri 5 Apr [2013] all relevant samples were taken, and ISA was confirmed on Sat 6 Apr 2013, with which the status of outbreak was established. The laboratory analysis resulted negative to HPR-0 and in the next few days we will confirm the specific strain by sequencing," said Ansoleaga.

According to the biosafety protocol, when an ISA outbreak is declared, an immediate harvest has to be enforced. The company implicated initiated a preventive harvest on Friday [4 Apr 2013], with the supervision of Sernapesca. "In this case, we have controlled the entire productive chain, from its origin with the harvest of fish in the hatchery, to the processing plant in Quellon."

Sernapesca activated a sanitary campaign in the neighboring region of Melinka on Sun 7 Apr 2013, surveying in search for the virus."

Finally, Senarpesca's authorities made clear that the ISA virus is harmless for humans, and it is endemic in the country for which "it is expected that isolated episodes occur in areas where susceptible species are kept at high densities."

The disease is systemic and lethal, characterized by severe anemia and hemorrhages in several organs. It is a disease of great economic impact for the salmon industry. The disease is of obligatory notification to the OIE.
