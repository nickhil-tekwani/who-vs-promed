Three outbreaks of shigellosis have been reported in Minnesota during
recent weeks. The most recent was among people who attended the Goodhue
County Fair between August 11-15. The Health Department has confirmed that
some of the illness reported was shigellosis, but has not indicated the
exact number of confirmed cases. The source of the outbreak at the County
Fair is under investigation.
One of the earlier outbreaks involved 130 cases of gastroenteritis reported
via telephone calls to the Health Department during the first week of
August. That outbreak has been linked to patrons of a popular restaurant in
St. Louis Park, and two cases were confirmed as shigellosis. The third
outbreak was reported among patrons of a local hunt club, but no further
details were available.
