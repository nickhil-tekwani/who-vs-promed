As many as 26 endangered crocodiles have been found dead over the
last 3 days in northern India and experts attribute the rare mass
deaths to cirrhosis of the liver, authorities said on Friday [14 Dec
2007].

The reptiles died in the waters of the Chambal River, which runs
along the borders of the northern state of Uttar Pradesh and the
central state of Madhya Pradesh, baffling experts as it is considered
their natural habitat.

"Autopsies confirm liver cirrhosis as the cause of death," DNS Suman,
Uttar Pradesh's top wildlife official, told Reuters from Etawah town
on the banks of the Chambal where experts have camped to investigate
the deaths.

Poisoning was not suspected as fish in the river had not died, Suman
said, adding that scientists would test the water for the presence of
any liver-damaging toxins.

Cirrhosis is marked by the loss of liver tissue, leading to the loss
of function of the vital organ.

In the last 2 days, as many as 12 gharials have been found dead in
the Chambal River in Etawah's Chakar Nagar Tehsil.

While 4 carcasses were found on the banks, the other 8 were found
floating in the water. The deaths came under scrutiny after the NGO,
Society for Conservation of Nature, informed the Forest department
that it had spotted 2 dead crocodiles near the river. Department
officials visited the spot and took up the matter with the National
Chambal Sanctuary authorities.

Immediately after word was out, the Madhya Pradesh Forest department
also launched a search in the river. They found 4 carcasses in their
area.

District Magistrate of Etawah, Amit Gupta said, "We have sent the
carcasses for medical tests to find out the cause of death. The
Madhya Pradesh government is also carrying out similar tests."
Additional District Magistrate of Chakar Nagar Ali Hasan said while
the bodies were discovered in the last couple of days, the crocodiles
might have died earlier. He said a team of doctors and other wildlife
experts were trying to find out what could have killed crocodiles in
such large numbers.

Secretary of the NGO, Society for Conservation of Nature, Rajeev
Chauhan said, "I was informed by locals on Monday morning [10 Dec
2007] that 4 dead gharials had washed up on the river bank. I went to
check and found only 2 after which we informed forest authorities."

Senior officers of the Forest department have said that pollution in
the river waters was the likely cause behind the deaths. An officer
said it could also be a contagious disease. "The tests will reveal
the exact cause of death," he said. Despite several attempts,
officials of the National Chambal Sanctuary could not be contacted.

Over 100 alligators have fallen prey to a mysterious disease in
Chambal region here [Etawah], the sources said.

However, the reason behind their sudden deaths could not be ascertained.

A huge population of alligators is found in the Chambal region famous
for its barren topography.

A total of 16 carcasses of alligators found under National Chambal
Wildlife Park (Rashtriya Chambal Pashu Vihar) on the intervening
border of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh has put Uttar Pradesh
forest department on foot.

It all started with a single alligator found dead on the banks of
Chambal River near Barchauli village under Etawah range of National
Chambal Sanctuary, Project Agra, on Saturday [8 Dec 2007]. There was
no sign of injury on the animal's body and as per the post mortem
report the death was natural.

After the incident came to light, a combing operation was launched in
the area and 16 more alligators were discovered dead, out of which 4
were from Madhya Pradesh. Combing is still under way in the area. To
investigate the reasons, veterinarians from Kanpur Zoo and Bear
Rescue Centre Agra have reached the spot. The viscera of the dead
animals and a water sample will be sent for testing to IVRI [Indian
Veterinary Research Institute], Bareilly, said chief wildlife warden,
DNS Suman, who also left for the incident site.

[The Chambal River is a major fresh water river in India, so these
are likely fresh water crocodiles, or gharials.

Although the Chambal River -- a tributary of the Yamuna River in
northern India -- is ranked as one of India's cleanest rivers, its
gharial population - estimated at 700 - is facing decline.

The Chambal is one of 5 tributaries of the Yamuna River. The river
flows north-northeast through Madhya Pradesh, running for a time
through Rajasthan, then forming the boundary between Rajasthan and
Madhya Pradesh before turning southeast to join the Yamuna in Uttar
Pradesh state. During the monsoon season, from July to September, the
river floods, submerging bridges and disrupting rail and road traffic
between Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. At other times of the year the
water level is very shallow and difficult to navigate.

Gharials (_Gavialis gangeticus_) are distinguished by their very long
and narrow snout (an adult male has a large bulb on top of the tip of
his snout). The crocodile spends most of its time submerged in water
feeding on fish. Females lay their eggs on sandy riverbanks.

Gharials are one of the most endangered freshwater crocodile species,
with only 2000 left in the wild. The species is already extinct in
Pakistan, Bhutan, and Myanmar, and most likely in Bangladesh. Other
than a few recorded nests in Nepal, the largest remaining populations
are found in just 3 locations in India along the Son (2 nests), Girwa
(20 nests), and Chambal (68 nests) rivers.

This is a little bit of a baffling case. There are gharials as being
reported dead and with liver cirrhosis. Yet other animals and fish
are not reported as being dead. For example, the Ganges River dolphin
(_Platanista gangetica_) inhabits the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna, and
Karnaphuli-Sangu River systems of India, Nepal, and Bangladesh. This
vast area has been altered by the construction of more than 50 dams
and other irrigation-related projects, with dire consequences for the
river dolphins. Yet, in this case we are not told of any dead River
dolphins.

With a lack of other animals or fish being found dead, the river not
being a stagnant body of water, it is difficult to hazard a guess as
to the cause of the cirrhosis. The other question, is the cirrhosis
severe enough to produce death, or is it an ancillary finding on
postmortem examination?

We will be looking for further results of the postmortem and the
laboratory tests being run. Hopefully, someone will forward us those
results. - Mod.TG
