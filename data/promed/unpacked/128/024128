[Byline: Peter Beaumont]

The year-long Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has spread to a new province, with 2 cases -- one of them fatal -- confirmed in South Kivu. The confirmed cases were reported in the Mwenga area, some way south of the city of Bukavu, which sits on the country's eastern border with Rwanda. The latest cases, which have been concentrated around the cities of Beni and Butembo, follow recent deaths from the disease in the major city of Goma.

The Ebola outbreak in eastern DRC has killed 1808 people out of 2765 confirmed cases, according to the ministry of health.

One of the 2 new cases was a 24-year-old woman who had already had been identified last month [July 2019] as a high-risk contact of another Ebola case in Beni, more than 700 km [435 mi] north, according to a government statement issued on Friday [16 Aug 2019]. She travelled by bus, boat and road with her 2 children to Mwenga, in South Kivu, where she died on Tuesday [13 Aug 2019] night, according to a slide from a presentation by health officials.

Most of the cases reported outside the area of the immediate outbreak, including across the border in Uganda, have involved patients who have travelled from the area at the centre of the outbreak in North Kivu.

"Two cases which tested positive for Ebola were confirmed overnight in South Kivu, in Lwindi district in the Mwenga region," the health ministry said in a statement. The new cases are "a 24-year-old woman and her 7-month-old child," said Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyembe, the director of DRC's National Institute for Biomedical Research, in a statement released on Friday [16 Aug 2019]. The child is being treated.

The woman had received the experimental vaccine that has been used widely to inoculate contacts. However, the vaccine is not infallible, although it is believed to protect about 97% of those who have received it.

The new cases will again raise serious questions about whether the large-scale, international-led health response to the Congolese Ebola crisis is capable of containing the outbreak, which has been described by some officials as the most complex public health emergency in history. In July [2019], the outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern, but cases have nonetheless continued to appear in new locations amid acknowledged problems tracking contacts of those contracting the disease.

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director-general, tweeted: "Sad to confirm that two people who travelled from Beni to Mwanga in South Kivu, #DRC are infected with #Ebola. This has sparked a rapid response ... to provide treatment, identify all contacts, raise community awareness and begin vaccinating."

According to officials on the ground, a team was sent by air from Goma -- the region's largest city and home to nearly 2 million people -- to Mwenga on Friday [16 Aug 2019] to assist with the response. Ebola treatment centres have repeatedly been attacked by armed militiamen and disgruntled locals, hampering efforts to contain the epidemic in the conflict-ravaged east.

[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/08/news-scan-aug-15-2019

According to the World Health Organization's (WHO) online dashboard, 10 new cases of Ebola have been confirmed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), raising the outbreak total to 2852, and 380 suspected cases are still under investigation.

Fatalities have passed the 1900 mark, to stand at 1905, after 7 new deaths from the virus were confirmed today [15 Aug 2019].

According to the latest Disease Outbreak News from the WHO, transmission rates remain steady in the last week, with an average of 81 new cases per week in the last 6 weeks.

While there are no further cases of Ebola in Goma or outside the DRC, the WHO said transmission among health workers is still common.

"New infections continue to be reported among personnel working in community health posts and other facilities. In the last 21 days, 11 new cases were reported among health workers from Beni (3), Mandima (2), and one each in Katwa, Mabalako, Mambasa, Masereka, Mutwanga, and Vuhovi," the WHO said.

Health workers make up 5% of cases in this outbreak.

Burundi yesterday [13 Aug 2019] began vaccinating front-line workers against Ebola, part of efforts to prepare for possible Ebola cases, the World Health Organization (WHO) said today [14 Aug 2019] in a statement. The country's border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is southeast of the main outbreak area, and vaccination with VSV-EBOV began at the Gatumba entry point.

People vaccinated include health workers at entry points and other people who could potentially be exposed, including lab workers, surveillance teams, and burial teams.

Kazadi Mulombo, MD, the WHO's representative in Burundi, said in the statement, "The vaccination of health and front-line staff is a significant step forward in preparing for the response to this disease." The WHO has deployed experts to support the preparedness activities and trained 50 national immunization workers. The WHO has also provided logistical support to ensure cold chain storage for the vaccine and has provided supplies and equipment for the Ebola vaccine campaign.

No Ebola cases have been detected in Burundi. South Sudan, Uganda, and Rwanda are among the other DRC neighbors that have vaccinated front-line workers.

- Tue 13 Aug 2019. Ebola persists in hotspots
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/08/ebola-persists-beni-and-mandima-hotspots-orphan-numbers-grow
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

According to the latest weekly bulletin from the World Health Organization's (WHO) African regional office, the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) continues to rage in Beni and Mandima, with 60% of the cases confirmed in the last week coming from one of those towns.

In the past 21 days, 45% of new cases have come from Beni and 22% from Mandima, the WHO said.

In addition to high viral activity, Beni has seen increased unrest and violence linked to the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a rebel group based in Uganda and the DRC, in recent weeks.

"The security situation increased in volatility as a result of a surge in attacks from suspected ADF elements in Beni Health Zone and successive demonstrations," the WHO said. "A recent attack in Mbau on the Beni/Oicha axis led to the deaths of 6 civilians, including a prominent civil society leader. EVD operations in the area were temporarily suspended with resumption pending improvement in the security situation."

Regional instability has been identified as one of the main drivers of this outbreak, which has now lasted more than one year, despite an effective Ebola vaccine. Both [lack of] community trust in response workers and the response workers' inability to perform full surveillance in the aftermath of attacks lead to ongoing transmission.

Though cases have been concentrated in Beni and Mandima, a new health zone, Lolwa in Ituri province, has reported a confirmed case, bringing the number of affected health zones to 27. In the past 3 weeks, 17 health zones have reported at least one confirmed case.

Currently, contact tracing is ongoing in 19 health zones, with about 85% of contacts successfully tracked.

Also, 2 Ebola patients in Goma have been successfully treated for the virus and survived their infections, according to media reports. To date, 4 cases have been identified in the major city that borders Rwanda; 2 of the patients have died.

According to the WHO, all case contacts of the Goma patients are being actively followed, and 98% of case contacts of the Goma patients have been vaccinated.

The Daily Nation, a newspaper in Kenya, reported today [13 Aug 2019] that the surviving Goma patients are the wife and child of a miner from Ituri who died from his infection.

In related news, UNICEF [see UNICEF report below] announced today [13 Aug 2019] the number of children orphaned by this outbreak has doubled since April [2019], and now stands at 1380. An additional 2469 children have been separated from their parents within the last year because of the outbreak.

"This disease has been especially harrowing for children," said Pierre Ferry, UNICEF's head of child protection programs in the DRC. "Children are watching parents die in front of them or seeing loved ones taken to Ebola treatment centers, uncertain of when or if they will return."

According to UNICEF, they have trained 906 psychosocial assistants and psychologists who provide a range of individualized assistance for orphaned and separated children.

- Thu 15 Aug 2019. Update
[WHO Disease Outbreak News, abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/15-august-2019-ebola-drc/en/

The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continued this week with similar transmission intensity to recent weeks, with an average of 81 cases per week (range, 68-91 cases per week) in the past 6 weeks (see Figure 1 at source URL). There are currently no confirmed cases of EVD outside of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

This week, initial data from a randomized clinical trial (RCT) of EVD therapeutics were announced. The data showed that 2 of the 4 treatments trialled were more effective in treating EVD. As a result, patients in the 4 Ebola treatment centres that participated in the RCT will now be randomized to receive the 2 better performing treatments. Patients in treatment centres not participating in the RCT will continue to be able to access those treatments under a compassionate use protocol. This change will help ensure that every treatment centre patient receives the best possible treatment with the greatest chance of survival, based on the most recent evidence.

The data indicate that when people are willing and able to access care soon after the onset of symptoms, they have an increased chance of survival. Providing each patient with optimal supportive care, closely monitoring their progress, and addressing any other health issues has saved lives and will continue to be a top priority [see URL for update and press release].

No new confirmed cases have been reported in Goma city since our last report, with a total of 4 confirmed cases reported from Goma (n = 1) and Nyiragongo (n = 3) health zones to date. Two cases, who were infected via direct contact with the case reported on 30 Jul 2019, received treatment at an Ebola treatment centre in Goma city and were discharged on 13 Aug 2019. A total of 203 contacts of the Nyiragongo cases remain under surveillance.

In the 21 days from 24 Jul through 13 Aug 2019, 66 health areas within 17 health zones reported new cases (see Table 1 and Figure 2 at the source URL). During this period, a total of 228 confirmed cases were reported, with the majority coming from the health zones of Beni (42%, n = 96) and Mandima (20%, n = 46). A case was confirmed in Lolwa Health Zone, which is the 1st confirmed case in that health zone to date, bringing the total number of affected health zones over the course of the outbreak to 27. The case travelled from Mandima to Lolwa, where they became symptomatic. Currently, there is no evidence of local transmission of EVD in this health zone. Close identification and followup of contacts is ongoing to minimize the chance of local transmission.

New infections continue to be reported among personnel working in community health posts and other facilities. In the last 21 days, 11 new cases were reported among health workers from Beni (n = 3), Mandima (n = 2), and one each in Katwa, Mabalako, Mambasa, Masereka, Mutwanga, and Vuhovi. Cumulatively, 151 (5%) health workers have been infected to date.

As of 13 Aug 2019, a total of 2842 EVD cases were reported, including 2748 confirmed and 94 probable cases, of which 1905 cases died (overall case fatality ratio, 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 57% (1608) were female, and 29% (815) were children aged less than 18 years.

- Wed 14 Aug 2019. View on treating Ebola
[The Guardian, editorial, abridged, edited]
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/14/the-guardian-view-on-treating-ebola-science-is-the-start

This week has seen a heartening triumph of medical science: Ebola is now curable, doctors say. The announcement is also a timely one. Researchers have developed and trialled drugs that can cure this deadly disease. The problem now is to deliver them.

The news that 2 really effective treatments have been discovered and tested, and that they are being rolled out, could hardly be more welcome. International institutions and Congolese researchers and medics have performed a remarkable, almost impossible, feat in trialling these drugs in epidemic conditions.

Just as important as the existence of these medicines, though, is the question of their use and effectiveness. Getting the science right is only the beginning. Ensuring that the drugs are delivered where they are needed and used by those who need them most is a task at least as difficult and now more urgent. The vaccine used in this outbreak came out of the 2014 epidemic -- yet its limited success in containing the virus reflects the complexity of this crisis.

The scene of the latest outbreak is a province that has been fought over for the last 25 years by more than 120 armed groups and has seen grotesque human rights violations. Inhabitants have a deep and very understandable fear of outsiders. Those infected often hesitate to seek help from medics until they have been ill for several days -- so relatives see someone go into a treatment centre and come out dead. These related factors help to explain the shocking attacks that have killed more than 170 health workers and burned down 2 treatment centres. The hope is that a virtuous cycle can now be created: when families see so many patients being cured, they will gain confidence in the centres, and spread the word.

Ebola attracts so much more attention than the other scourges of the northeastern DRC not because it is lethal -- violence, measles, cholera and malnutrition all kill more people today -- but because it was regarded as incurable, and it potentially threatens outsiders too. In the case of the West African outbreak, this risk prompted huge financial and institutional support to flow into the region. The DRC still needs that kind of backing from outside. But local communities must lead the efforts to build trust in medics, because only they are trusted by the people who are falling sick. Effective drugs are a necessary condition for the epidemic to be beaten, but unless people are willing to go to the treatment centres when they are sick, the hope they raise will be once more extinguished.

- Tue 13 Aug 2019. Orphans
[UNICEF, edited]
https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/number-children-orphaned-or-left-unaccompanied-ebola-democratic-republic-congo

The number of children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) who have been orphaned or left unaccompanied due to the Ebola epidemic has more than doubled since April [2019], requiring a rapid ramp-up of specialized care in the Ebola-hit provinces of Ituri and North Kivu.

UNICEF and partners have registered 1380 orphans, meaning children who have lost one or both parents to Ebola, since the start of the outbreak just over a year ago. In this same period, 2469 children have been separated from their parents or caregivers -- either left alone while adults undergo screening and treatment, or isolated because they've been in contact with someone infected.

"This disease has been especially harrowing for children," says Pierre Ferry, UNICEF's head of child protection programmes in the DRC. "Children are watching parents die in front of them or seeing loved ones taken to Ebola treatment centers, uncertain of when or if they will return. They are struggling with grief and anxiety, while having to comfort and care for younger siblings. Many face discrimination, stigmatization and isolation."

UNICEF is working closely with partners and communities to rapidly identify affected children and tailor support to address their extensive physical, psychological and social needs. To date, UNICEF has trained 906 psychosocial assistants and psychologists who provide a range of individualized assistance for orphaned and separated children.

"Coming from the affected communities, psychosocial workers are among the most trusted actors in the response," says Ferry. "As a result, they've been able to reduce harmful discrimination and misinformation and boost community acceptance and engagement, which is crucial to stopping the outbreak."

For unaccompanied children, psychosocial teams provide dedicated care that includes food, psychological support and material assistance. UNICEF runs 3 nurseries next to Ebola treatment centers in the epidemic's hotspots, where Ebola survivors, who are immune to the disease, care for and closely monitor infants and very young children until their parents or caregivers have completed treatment.

For children with no surviving parents, the needs are longer-term. Psychosocial assistants work to place children with nurturing relatives or foster families -- no easy task given the economic burden of raising extra children and the pervasive fear of catching the disease or being associated with it. It often requires delicate mediation as well as financial support for food, school fees and other basic necessities. The nature of the support is determined by the most pressing needs of each child or family.

All the children require psychosocial assistance to mitigate the debilitating effects of loss, stigma and isolation, which is why UNICEF is working to quickly scale up child protection programs in Ebola-affected areas.

"The number of children orphaned to Ebola or left unaccompanied is growing as fast as the outbreak itself," says Edouard Beigbeder, UNICEF Representative in the DRC. "Care, specialized assistance and resources for these vulnerable children must keep pace."

- Wed 14 Aug 2019. Burundi vaccination campaign
[WHO Afro, abridged, edited]
https://afro.who.int/news/burundi-launches-ebola-vaccination-campaign-health-and-front-line-workers?country=&name

On 13 Aug [2019], the Ministry of Public Health and AIDS Control kicked off the vaccination campaign for front-line staff against the Ebola virus disease. The campaign started at the Gatumba entry point at the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The Ebola vaccination campaign is part of Burundi's preparation for a possible case of Ebola. The campaign will be implemented under leadership of the Ministry of Public Health and AIDS Control, with the support of the World Health Organization (WHO). Financial support is provided by GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance.

Burundi has received doses of the Ebola vaccine (rVSV-ZEBOV) to provide protection against the Zaire strain of the virus, which is currently affecting the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). It will be administered to health and front-line staff working in priority areas where there is a risk of transmission. These are health workers working at points of entry into the country as well as other people potentially exposed to the Ebola virus disease, such as laboratory workers, surveillance teams and people responsible for carrying out dignified and secure burials.

"The vaccination of health and front-line staff is a significant step forward in preparing for the response to this disease," said Dr. Kazadi Mulombo, WHO Representative in Burundi. Vaccination is one of the many preparedness measures that Burundi has planned to put in place. WHO deployed experts to support these activities and trained 50 national immunization workers on behalf of the Ministry of Public Health and AIDS Control. The training consisted of familiarization with the principles of good clinical practice and standard protocol procedures. This new knowledge is necessary for the administration of the Ebola vaccine and includes the ability to conduct ring vaccination, vaccinating only those people who are most likely to be infected in case of a reported Ebola case in Burundi.

No cases of Ebola have been reported in Burundi, but preparation remains crucial. WHO, which supports Burundi in preparedness activities, has provided logistical support to ensure the cold chain and facilitated the provision of supplies and equipment necessary to carry out the vaccination campaign.

WHO provided special vaccine carriers and upgraded the cold chain of the Expanded Programme on Immunization of the Ministry of Public Health and AIDS Control, through the installation of additional freezers adapted to this type of vaccine. The capacity of local laboratories to analyse samples taken from people suspected of being infected with the Ebola virus has also been strengthened through the upgrading of the laboratory of the National Institute of Public Health.

WHO also supports the Government of Burundi in engaging with communities, community-based active surveillance, capacity building for infection prevention and control and case management and the dissemination of information on Ebola through the mass media.

[Multisectoral National Committee of the Response to Ebola virus disease, Technical Secretariat, abridged, edited]
https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/h5n1/2019/08/drc-ebola-10-new-cases-on-august-15-8-deaths-4-recoveries.html

- The cross-border meeting on the Ebola virus disease (EVD), which brought together the DRC, Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi and South Sudan, ended on [Thu 15 Aug 2019]. From this meeting, several recommendations emerged from which the establishment bilateral collaboration with the DRC and sharing of expertise, development of memoranda of understanding, protocols and standard operating procedures to guide areas for such collaboration, establishment of common cross-border monitoring and joint response between DRC, Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi and South Sudan, as well as the acceleration of emergency health expert travel and joint assessments to consolidate lessons learned and make [recommendations according] to the IHR at the end of the epidemic.
- In addition, WHO and other partners will provide technical and financial assistance to countries to monitor and implement the recommendations, convene a high-level political meeting and follow up on the implementation of the recommendations.
- This 2-day meeting brought together health experts from 4 countries and different stakeholders in the response. It was organized by WHO to respond to its July 2019 decision in Geneva to place the 10th EVD epidemic in the DRC as a health emergency of international concern. However, WHO has recommended that all neighboring DRC countries prepare to effectively treat potential cases of Ebola and other health emergencies.
- It aimed to discuss measures to strengthen cross-border collaboration between the DRC and these 3 countries with Ebola response preparedness as a 1st priority. Participants discussed, in turn, several themes, including the situation of the EVD outbreak in the DRC, the status of activities and emergency preparedness capacities in the districts bordering the DRC. DRC, the overview of the 4th edition of the Strategic Response Plan, strengthening the functions and operational framework of the mandatory and optional National Focal Points (NFPs) of the IHR and improving cross-border collaboration in the context of the HIV / AIDS epidemic; EVD in the DRC.
- Next steps will be the development and finalization of the bilateral roadmaps for the implementation of the above recommendations with concrete timelines and resources, as well as the organization of a high-level political meeting to encourage political ownership and mobilization of domestic resources.
