Although not back on his cattle and sheep farm yet, a Namibian Congo fever
[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic a fever] patient has been discharged from
hospital. He was discharged from the Bloemfontein Medi-Clinic on Friday [30
Jul 2010]. According to his wife they decided that he should stay behind in
South Africa for the rest of the week to recuperate. This, she said, was
also because she was still recovering from the flu, and "should there be a
problem", he would be close to the doctors who had taken care of him the
last 2 weeks.

His wife returned to their farm, on Saturday [31 Jul 2010]. Their 2
children had stayed on the farm for the past fortnight, monitoring their
own health to make sure that they had not contracted the deadly fever. Last
week [week ending 1 Aug 2010], the farmer's wife was also admitted to
hospital after her temperature rose to over 38 deg C [100.4 deg F]. It was
feared that she also had the deadly disease. She was discharged a day
later, when laboratory results showed she did not have Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever.

Earlier, Dr Jack Vries of the Ministry of Health and Social Services urged
Namibians to remain calm but vigilant. He said it was the first outbreak of
the disease, which closely resembles Rift Valley fever (RVF), in the
country for the past 8 years. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, mainly
spread by tick bites, is a notifiable disease.

The country also experienced an outbreak of RVF -- the first since 1985 --
this year [2010]. Last week [week of 26 Jul 2010], the United Nations (UN)
praised Namibia for successfully fighting the outbreak without losing any
human lives.

[Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral haemorrhagic fever
caused by a virus belonging to the genus _Nairovirus_ of the family
_Bunyaviridae_ . Although primarily a zoonosis, sporadic cases and
outbreaks of CCHF affecting humans do occur. The disease is endemic in many
countries in Africa, Europe, and Asia. Outbreaks were recorded in South
Africa in 2008. Recent outbreaks are listed below.

The geographical distribution of the virus, like that of its tick vector,
is widespread. Evidence of CCHF virus has been found in Africa, Asia, the
Middle East, and eastern Europe. Health care workers in endemic areas
should be aware of the illness and the correct infection control procedures
to protect themselves and their patients from the risk of nosocomial
(hospital-acquired) infection.

CCHF virus may infect a wide range of domestic and wild animals. Many birds
are resistant to infection, but ostriches are susceptible and may show a
high prevalence of infection in endemic areas. Animals become infected with
CCHF from the bite of infected ticks.

Humans who become infected with CCHF acquire the virus from direct contact
with blood or other infected tissues from livestock during this time, or
they may become infected from a tick bite. The majority of cases have
occurred in those involved with the livestock industry, such as
agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians.

The length of the incubation period for the illness appears to depend on
the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection via tick bite,
the incubation period is usually 1 to 3 days, with a maximum of 9 days. The
incubation period following contact with infected blood or tissues is
usually 5 to 6 days, with a documented maximum of 13 days. Onset of
symptoms is sudden, with fever, myalgia (aching muscles), dizziness, neck
pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and photophobia
(sensitivity to light). There may be nausea, vomiting, and sore throat
early on, which may be accompanied by diarrhoea and generalised abdominal
pain. Over the next few days, the patient may experience sharp mood swings,
and may become confused and aggressive. After 2 to 4 days, the agitation
may be replaced by sleepiness, depression, and lassitude, and the abdominal
pain may localize to the right upper quadrant, with detectable hepatomegaly
(liver enlargement).

The mortality rate from CCHF is about 30 per cent, with death occurring in
the 2nd week of illness. In those patients who recover, improvement
generally begins on the 9th or 10th day after the onset of illness. More
detailed information concerning the care and treatment of patients who have
contracted CCHF can be found at

Namibia is located in south west Africa bordered by Zimbabwe and South
Africa (<http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/af.htm>). A map
