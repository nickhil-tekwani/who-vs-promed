First Cases of California encephalitis in Equines in Louisiana
-------------------------------------------------------------
According to Dr. Louise McFarland, lately Louisiana State Epidemiologist, we
have 2 recent cases of California encephalitis (CE) in equines in
Louisiana, both in Livingston Parish, and confirmed by CDC. Horse I: Onset
15 Aug 2000, 2.5 years old, no current vaccinations, presumed to be now dead
as only one blood sample was provided. Horse II: Onset 18 September, 1.5
years old, died, vaccinated against Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) in
April of this year.
Serology is as follows:
Horse I Horse II
EEE IgM 512 <64
WEE IgM 256 <64
CE IgM 512 <64
SLE IgM 256 <64
EEE IgG 128 64
WEE IgG 128 64
CE IgG 1024 256
SLE IgG 128 64
As this is serology on single blood samples, it can only be regarded as
presumptive, however persuasive.
In the past we have had some 6 human cases of California encephalitis during
the past dozen years. These are the first equine cases of California
encephalitis in Louisiana.
This year there have been only 5 equine cases of Eastern Equine
Encephalitis: i.e. St Landry Parish (11 Sep 2000), Vernon (24 Mar 2000),
Tangipahoa (4 May 2000), Livingston (16 May 2000), and East Baton Rouge (2
May 2000).
