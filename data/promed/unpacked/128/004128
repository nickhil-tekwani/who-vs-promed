Australian animal health and food safety agencies are investigating what
appears to be a new disease affecting the mortality of unborn and very
young pigs. The condition has been limited to two piggeries in New South
Wales (NSW), owned and operated by the country's largest pork producer.
They say that no human health risks have been identified and the disease
outbreaks are reported to be resolving.
What is Porcine Myocarditis? (PMC)
----------------------------
According to a factsheet produced by the NSW Agriculture Dept., Porcine
Myocarditis (PMC) is a new disease which affects unborn piglets and growing
swine up to 5 weeks of age. Clinical manifestations are increased
stillbirths and a rise in pre-weaning mortality.
The cause of PMC has not yet been identified.
Steps to control the disease
-----------------------------
Movement controls are in place to ensure the disease is not introduced to
other farms. Both affected pig farms are subject to ongoing inspections by
key authorities.
Members of the National Consultative Committee on Emergency Animal Diseases
(CCEAD), including independent scientific experts and State and
Commonwealth scientists have been notified and are involved in identifying
the cause of PMC and preventing its introduction to other farms.
Quarantine and inspection measures ensure that only healthy pigs are
processed for human consumption.
PMC has only been detected in pigs up to 5 weeks of age and has not been
detected in any adult pigs intended for human consumption.
PMC has been listed as a notifiable disease under the Stock Diseases Act,
requiring that NSW Agriculture be notified of any sign of the disease on
any NSW property.
Specialist pig vets are being notified throughout Australia to be alert to
any similar signs and know to report these immediately to authorities.
Key pork customers of the piggery both domestically and internationally
have been advised as well as veterinarian authorities in key overseas markets.
