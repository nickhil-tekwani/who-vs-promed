Doctor Suroto Hospital in Ngawi is treating a 2-year-old child
allegedly suffering from bird flu, kompas.com reported on Tue 17 Mar
2009. The father of the child said that doctors at Karangjati public
health center had transferred his child on Tuesday morning after
knowing the patient had contacts with chickens that died of avian
influenza virus a week earlier.

"Officials from Ngawi Husbandry Agency declared the virus was the
cause of the deaths of 30 chicken nearby our home. Three days later,
my child suffered from fever and cough," the father said.

Doctor Harun Al Rasyid said that he was waiting for the blood
examination result from a health laboratory to find out whether or
not the patient had indeed suffered from bird flu. "We'll also do an
X-ray of the patient's lungs and expect to get the results within the
coming days," Harun said. If its proven that the toddler was
suffering from bird flu, he added, the Suroto hospital would transfer
the patient to Sudono Hospital in Madiun, as it is the only
recommended hospital bird flu patient treatment in East Java.
