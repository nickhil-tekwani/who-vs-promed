A batch of dodgy profiteroles is being blamed on a listeriosis outbreak that could have spread across 13 public hospitals in Sydney.

The NSW [New South Wales] Department of Health says that so far 3 patients, including a terminally ill man at Campbelltown Hospital who has since died, have tested positive for listeriosis. The 2 other patients, one from Concord hospital and another from the Royal Prince Alfred are responding well to treatment.

The profiteroles, which were made by Rich Products Australia, have since been withdrawn from all patient meals.

An investigation into the outbreak, which is believed to have occurred between mid-March and 16 Apr 2013, is ongoing.

NSW Director of Health Protection Jeremy McAnulty says the risk of further cases is low but if people are concerned they should seek medical advice.

"If people did eat profiteroles in one of the hospitals in central or southwest Sydney and they get the symptoms of listeriosis then they should see their doctor," he said. "We've withdrawn them from serving to patients."

[Symptoms] include fever, muscle aches, and sometimes gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and diarrhoea. In the more severe form, symptoms also include collapse and shock.

[Listeriosis is a worldwide zoonosis caused by _Listeria monocytogenes_, which is transmitted by ingestion of contaminated food. Infection results in diarrhea and, in some patients, invasive disease that includes bacteremia without an evident focus, meningitis, abscesses in the brain and spinal cord, endocarditis, and intrauterine infection. Infection during pregnancy can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn, or stillbirth. Invasive listeriosis is rare (about 2500 cases occur annually in the USA), but the disease has an overall mortality rate of 20 to 30 percent. Newborns, pregnant women, people 60 years of age or older, and those with compromised immune defenses (such as HIV-infected patients) are most susceptible to invasive disease.

Food implicated in outbreaks has included raw milk, soft cheeses such as Latin-American cheeses, feta, brie, and Camembert, ice cream, raw vegetables and fruit, or consumption of ready-to-eat food that has been contaminated during processing of food, such as deli meat and delicatessen salads such as coleslaw, raw and smoked fish, shellfish such as shrimp, and undercooked chicken.

When _L. monocytogenes_ get into a food-processing facility (such as, factories processing smoked fish, poultry, meat, and dairy products), they persist there for years and can contaminate food after factory cooking, but before packaging. Particularly problematic is the fact that _L. monocytogenes_ can grow in refrigeration temperatures during storage, which is why even minimal contamination with this bacterium during the processing of subsequently refrigerated ready-to-eat food can cause severe foodborne infections.

Nosocomial listeriosis has been described previously related to food service in healthcare facilities. Since listeriosis is more severe in newborns, pregnant women, people 60 years of age or older, and those with compromised immune defenses, food such as refrigerated, packaged ready-to-eat products, such as, cold cut meats, should not be part of a menu in health care settings.

A profiterole or cream puff is a hollow pastry ball filled with whipped cream, pastry cream, or ice cream and the puff garnished with chocolate sauce, caramel, or a dusting of powdered sugar (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profiterole).

Comparison of the molecular characteristics, such as PFGE, of _L. monocytogenes_ strains isolated from the cases with each other and with that of strains isolated from suspected foods help to confirm a common source for an outbreak.

The incubation period for listeriosis ranges from 3 to 70 days, with the median incubation period being 3 weeks. With such a long incubation period, we may continue to see more cases of listeriosis in this outbreak.
