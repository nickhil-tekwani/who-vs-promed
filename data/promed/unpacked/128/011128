To date, only serotype H5N1 has been identified in India. See commentaries in ProMED-mail post archive number 20140221.2293254.

Although this event may also be associated with H5N1, information on the neuraminidase type would be much appreciated, particularly given the recent spread of the highly pathogenic H5N8 serotype.
