CITRUS DISEASE - INDIA: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
***********************************************
A ProMED-mail post

From: Belliappa Malchira <msbelliappa@hotmail.com>

I am an Agriculturist with a life-time spent on the growing and production
of foodgrains. I basically grow Coffee and in addition I also grow Pepper,
Orange, Lemon, rice and Oil palms.
One of the major problems with the cultivation of Citrus plants in our
region, I have noticed, is the French Disease. The French Disease has wiped
out 97% of all citrus plants in IndiaÂ´s best producing region. In my
personal context, I have lost 99.9% of nearly 100 000 citrus plants. I now
have only (believe it or not) 20 Orange growing trees and another 40 Lemon
and other Citrus trees left.
This is a desperate plea to reclaim what was once lush and beautiful. Any
help or Information on how to combat it and about disease resistant strains
would be a lifesaver. Please mail with Information or request for Inspection.
