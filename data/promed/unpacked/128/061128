Nigeria: Children Not Infected by Avian Influenza virus
-------------------------------------------------------
Two Nigerian children suspected of having [contracted] avian
influenza probably did not have the virus after all, health officials
said on Tuesday [14 Feb 2006]. "They had a fever and were not
infected by the bird flu virus. They have been treated and are now
okay," said permanent secretary of the Health Ministry in the
northern state of Kaduna, Abdulhamid Abubakar, a medical doctor. If
the children had contracted the disease, they would have been the
first humans known to be infected in Africa.

Nigeria: Screening of Poultry Workers Begins
--------------------------------------------------
Doctors have begun screening workers in northern Nigeria at the 1st
poultry farm to be confirmed with the deadly bird flu virus in
Africa. The virulent H5N1 strain was found in birds in 3 states last
week. Health Minister Eyitayo Lambo said another 5 states had
suspected cases. Some farmers are angered by the government's
handling of the outbreak, saying compensation was too low. Thousands
of chickens have been dying in Nigeria for more than a month.
Dr Mohammed Bala Abubakar, from Kaduna State's health ministry, told
the BBC that tests were being carried out on some 120 workers from
Sambawa farm in Kaduna State on Monday [13 Feb 2006] and would
continue throughout the week. None of the workers on the farm where
the outbreak was first identified have shown any signs of illness, he said.
Two children, who live near the farm in Kaduna State and who fell ill
last week, have since recovered and been released. However, their
blood samples have been sent to several laboratories for analysis, he said.
H5N1 has also been found on farms in Kano and Plateau States, either
side of Kaduna. Mr Lambo and his health ministry officials say there
are 5 other states with suspected bird flu cases: Abuja, where the
capital is located, Katsina, Nassarawa, Yobe and Jigawa states.
Experts with protective equipment are being flown in from abroad to
help local officials contain the spread of the disease. Neighbouring
countries have banned chicken imports from Nigeria.
Meanwhile, farmers in Kano, who estimate they have lost some 150 000
chickens since the crisis began, are demanding $10 in compensation
for each bird lost. So far, the government has only offered them $2
for each chicken. [note, it is unclear what currency these amounts
are referring to - US Dollars or Nigerian Naira - Mod.MPP]
The BBC's Ado Saleh in Kano says there is a rising sense of panic
among the farmers as they have yet to be told what has been killing
their livestock. The World Health Organization (WHO) has called for a
massive public education campaign, to stop bird flu from spreading to
humans in Nigeria. It is not clear how the virus has spread to
Nigeria. It was first found in South-East Asia and more recently
Turkey and Russia. Some experts blame illegal poultry imports; others
migrating birds.
More than 80 people have died of H5N1 bird flu since the disease's
resurgence in December 2003 - most of them in South-East Asia.
Experts point out that cross-infection to humans is still relatively
rare, and usually occurs where people have been in close contact with
infected birds.

Greece: 2 Suspected Cases Discharged after Testing Negative
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Greek Health Authorities stated on Tuesday [14 Feb 2006] that a
hunter suspected of having contracted avian influenza had tested
negative, as authorities enlisted the country's powerful Orthodox
Church to educate farmers about how to prevent infection.
Since re-emerging in Asia in late 2003, avian influenza has killed at
least 91 people in Asia and the Middle East and spread west across
the globe as far as Sicily and Nigeria. [As of 13 Feb 2006, however,
human cases have been recorded in seven countries only: Cambodia (4
cases and 4 deaths), China (12 cases and 8 deaths), Indonesia (25
cases and 18 deaths), Iraq (1 case and 1 death), Thailand (22 cases
and 14 deaths), Turkey (12 cases and 4 deaths), and Viet Nam (93
cases and 42 deaths). - Mod.CP]
Over the weekend, health authorities confirmed the presence of the
highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of the virus in 3 swans in northern
Greece, reporting, with Italy, the 1st cases of infected migratory
birds on European Union soil. Two people were also being tested after
coming into contact with suspect poultry and developing flu-like
symptoms. A 15-year-old boy was released on Monday [13 Feb 2006]
after twice testing negative. The 29-year-old hunter was released
from quarantine on Tuesday [14 Feb 2006], after he tested negative
too. "The Centre for Infectious Diseases Control announced that both
primary and secondary laboratory tests for the H5N1 strain are
negative," the ministry said in a statement.
Health officials have resorted to the Greek Orthodox church to step
up the fight against bird flu. In a letter to church leaders, the
Health Ministry asked priests to spread the word on precautions
farmers should take to prevent infection by reading an advice
bulletin to worshippers. It includes measures such as regular
handwashing, a warning against approaching wild or free range birds,
and a request that any dead poultry be reported immediately to the authorities.
