Viet Nam: Avian influenza Situation - WHO Update 22
--------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Viet Nam has today confirmed that between 1 to 17
Jun 2005, 4 cases of human infection with H5N1 avian influenza virus were
reported. 2 of the patients are from Hanoi and one is from the nearby
province of Hai Duong. The 4th patient is from the central province of Nghe An.
All 4 of the patients are alive. At present, a total of 7 patients are
being treated for H5N1 avian influenza at a hospital in Hanoi.
These newly confirmed cases bring the total, in Viet Nam, since
mid-December 2004 to 59 cases, of which 18 were fatal.

Viet Nam: Doctor in Hanoi Has Contracted Avian Influenza
--------------------------------------------------
A Vietnamese doctor in Hanoi who treated avian influenza patients has
contracted the disease himself, leaders of the Bach Mai Hospital reported
on Fri 17 Jun 2005. The male doctor had been taking samples from carriers
of the H5N1 avian influenza virus, officials said, adding that his
condition was stable.
The infection took the number of avian influenza victims revealed this week
in Viet Nam to 7 and the number of infections since Dec 2004 to 62.
11 avian influenza patients have been hospitalized at the National
Institute for Clinical Research of Tropical Medicine in Hanoi, the
officials said. The center is also treating 12 suspected avian influenza
cases. Their conditions are all "relatively stable". Although the
development of avian influenza in humans has been less serious than at the
beginning of the latest outbreak in late 2004, its indications are
untypical and changing, doctors at the hospital warned.
The H5N1 avian influenza virus has killed 38 people in Vietnam since it
appeared in late 2003. 12 Thais and 4 Cambodians have also died.

Viet Nam: 5 More New Human Cases of Avian Influenza
--------------------------------------------------
Viet Nam reported on Fri 17 Jun 2005 that 5 more people have contracted
avian influenza virus infection as the country struggles to contain the
disease, officials said.
Avian influenza has ravaged poultry farms throughout Asia and jumped to
humans, killing 54 people in 3 countries. Viet Nam has been the hardest hit
with 38 deaths so far. The 5 latest cases bring the total of people
infected with the virus to 11 over the past week, said Tran Quy, director
of Bach Mai hospital in Hanoi. The patients, all from northern provinces,
are being treated at the hospital and are in stable condition, he said.
Quy said separately that a male doctor at the hospital who helped take
samples from the patients initially tested positive for the disease, but a
2nd test turned up negative.
Avian influenza has killed 38 people in Viet Nam, 12 in Thailand and 4 from
Cambodia since the outbreak began in 2003.

[There are discrepancies between these reports which appear to confuse
confirmed and suspected cases. As of 17 Jun 2005, the most recent WHO
Update recognizes 4 new human cases of avian influenza, bringing the total
of confirmed cases since Dec 2004 to 59 (18 of whom have died).
It is evident from the other reports that there are additional cases under
investigation and that a few people are still contracting avian influenza
in northern Viet Nam. It has been widely reported in the media that one of
the doctors treating avian influenza virus patients in Hanoi has himself
contracted avian influenza. However, the 3rd report above states that a 2nd
test has proved negative and it is unlikely that the doctor is suffering
from avian influenza. - Mod.CP]
