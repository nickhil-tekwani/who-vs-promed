A previously healthy 35-year-old woman was admitted on 26 Mar 2011 to
the emergency room at the Ramon y Cajal Hospital in Madrid, Spain,
because of sepsis and respiratory distress. She had just returned from
an 11 month long leisure travel through Africa, starting April 2010
from South Africa and ending March 2011 in Morocco. She also visited
Madagascar, Namibia, Botswana, Angola, Sao Tome, Cameroon, Gabon,
Nigeria, Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali, Senegal, and Mauritania.

Just after her arrival in Madrid, she developed sepsis and severe
respiratory distress, with a diffuse pulmonary reticular-nodular
pattern. Blood cultures demonstrate _Burkholderia_ sp. sensitive to
amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ceftazidime, piperacilline/tazobactam,
and meropenem, but resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

The patient was diagnosed with possible melioidosis and treated with
high doses of intravenous ceftazidime and doxycycline with marked
improvement. She is still admitted at the hospital receiving
intravenous antibiotics and waiting for the final identification of
the bacterium.

Neither special high-risk activities for contracting melioidosis were
identified, nor were underlying disease or immunosuppression detected.
Her husband who traveled with her is asymptomatic.

[_Burkholderia pseudomallei_ exists as an environmental saprophyte
living in soil and surface water in endemic areas (Southeast Asia and
northern, tropical Australia), particularly in rice paddies. In
endemic countries, the organism exists primarily in focal areas and
not equally distributed throughout the landscape. Sporadic cases have
been reported to have been acquired in parts of Africa and the
Americas. Regarding Africa, the following was adapted from Dance DAB:
Melioidosis: the tip of the iceberg? Clin Microbiol Rev. 1991; 4(1):
52-60 (available at
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC358178/pdf/cmr00042-0068.pdf):

"The possibility of the existence of melioidosis in Africa was first
raised in 1936 by Girard, who isolated a strain of _Pseudomonas
pseudomallei_ from the hemorrhagic submaxillary lymph node of a pig in
Madagascar....In 1969, melioidosis was reported in a goat in Chad.
Then, in 1972, Ferry isolated _P. pseudomallei_ from a number of pigs
in an abattoir in Niamey, Niger. These animals had been brought from
neighboring Upper Volta (Burkina Faso), and Dodin and Ferry were able
to isolate the organism from soil samples taken along the route that
the pigs had followed. They also demonstrated seropositivity in over
10 percent of serum samples from villagers in Upper Volta. At about
this time, Frazier found serological evidence that melioidosis might
exist in Uganda, while Mayer, as cited by Larionov, also reported the
occurrence of human melioidosis in Uganda....Further evidence of
melioidosis in Africa was provided by Bremmelgard, et al, who reported
a case of human melioidosis possibly acquired in Kenya, and by Wall,
et al, in The Gambia, the latter patient originating from Sierra
Leone."

Melioidosis occurs mainly affecting people who have direct contact
with soil and water. Many have an underlying predisposing condition
such as diabetes (most common risk factor), renal disease, cirrhosis,
thalassemia, alcohol dependence, immunosuppressive therapy, chronic
obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and excess kava
consumption. Kava is an herbal member of the pepper family that can be
associated with chronic liver disease. HIV infection, however, may not
a clear risk factor for more severe disease. Melioidosis may present
at any age, but peaks in the 4th and 5th decades of life, affecting
males more than women. In addition, although severe fulminating
infection can and does occur in healthy individuals, severe disease
and fatalities are much less common in those without risk factors.

In acute severe melioidosis, there is characteristically the rapid
progression of respiratory failure that is due to acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) and/or pneumonia. It has been suggested that
the ARDS to melioidosis sepsis is more rapid in progression than with
other bacteria and may be related to the intracellular interactions of
the bacillus and the leukocyte. Bacteremia without shock/hypotension
has a substantially better prognosis.
