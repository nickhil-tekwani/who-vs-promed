Salmonella Outbreak Linked to Salami Sticks
-------------------------------------------

Fast Facts
Illnesses: 21 (1 new)
Hospitalizations: 6 (3 new)
Deaths: 0
States: 8
Recall: No
Investigation status: Active

Epidemiologic data show that Citterio brand Premium Italian-Style Salame Sticks may be contaminated with _Salmonella_ and are making people sick.

Epidemiologic Data
------------------
As of 27 Oct 2021, one more illness has been reported. A total of 21 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- have been reported from 8 states (see map at https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/i45-10-21/map.html). Illnesses started on dates ranging from 18 Sep 2021 to 3 Oct 2021 (see timeline at https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/i45-10-21/epi.html).

State / Number of sick people
-----------------------------
California / 8
Illinois / 3
Kansas / 1
Michigan / 3
Minnesota / 3
New Jersey / 1
New York / 1
Virginia / 1

Sick people range in age from 2 to 75 years, with a median age of 12. Most of the sick people (81%) are younger than 18, and 62% are female. Of 18 people with information available, 6 have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

The true number of sick people in an outbreak is likely much higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because many people recover without medical care and are not tested for _Salmonella_. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it usually takes 3 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

State and local public health officials are interviewing people about the foods they ate in the week before they got sick. Among 15 people interviewed, all (100%) reported eating salami sticks, and 14 (93%) reported eating or maybe eating Citterio brand Premium Italian-Style Salame Sticks. Thirteen people bought Citterio brand Premium Italian-Style Salame Sticks from Trader Joe's, and one person bought them from Wegmans grocery store.

Laboratory Data
---------------
WGS analysis of bacteria from 14 people's samples and one raw ground pork sample predicted resistance to one or more of the following antimicrobials: ampicillin, kanamycin, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline. Standard antibacterial susceptibility testing by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory is currently underway. Most people with _Salmonella_ illness recover without antimicrobials. However, if antibacterials are needed, this resistance is unlikely to affect the choice of therapy used to treat most people.

Public Health Actions
---------------------
CDC is continuing to advise not to eat, sell, or serve Citterio brand Premium Italian-Style Salame Sticks regardless of where they were purchased.

[One new case has been added but 3 of the group have been added to the hospitalized group as more data is collected.

As a review, _Salmonella_ as a genus has 2 species, _enterica_ and _bongori_. _S. enterica_ is divided into 6 subspecies: _enterica_, _salamae_, _arizonae_, _diarizonae_, _houtenae_, and _indica_. _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ (or subspecies I) strains are the ones usually isolated from humans or warm-blooded animals and represent a majority of the salmonellas that are clinically important.

The designation _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- means:
- the "I" reflects subspecies _enterica_;
- the "4,[5],12" are the O (or somatic) antigens associated with the organism. An O antigen underscored or placed in [ ] can refer to whether the antigen is related to phage conversion;
- the nomenclature after the colon, in this case i:-, reflects the flagellar or H antigens. - Mod.LL
