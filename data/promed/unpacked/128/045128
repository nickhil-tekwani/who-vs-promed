Another 12 victims of salmonella outbreak
-------------
12 more people have fallen victim to a rare strain of salmonella which may
have already caused one fatality in Scotland.
34 cases of _Salmonella bareilly_ have now been confirmed in England and
Wales, and 19 in Scotland, taking the number in August 2003 above the total
for the whole of 2002. An elderly woman in Scotland contracted the illness
and later died.
Doctors are still puzzled by the outbreak, but health investigation teams
believe there is a single source. Information from public health agencies
in Australia, the US, and Europe point to exotic foods or spices from the
Far East.
The Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health (SCIEH), the
public health agency leading the investigation, has emphasized there is no
cause for alarm, as the poisoning is not normally life-threatening.
Doctors are trying to trace common products or ingredients the patients may
have consumed. The incubation period is between 12 and 72 hours, with
common features including diarrhea, vomiting, and fever. It is transmitted
predominantly from foodstuffs, usually meat, raw eggs, milk, and dairy
products, following contamination of cooked food by raw food or the failure
to achieve adequate cooking temperatures.
_Salmonella bareilly_ is normally associated with foreign travel,
particularly to the Indian sub-continent, although none of the new cases
has a recent travel history.
