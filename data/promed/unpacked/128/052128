Two pregnant women gave birth prematurely after eating contaminated
chicken wraps that were sold in their thousands on Virgin Blue
flights from Brisbane and the Gold Coast, triggering a national
public health alert. The airline confirmed yesterday [6 Aug 2009]
that up to 5000 flights in May and June [2009] could have carried the
snacks laced with potentially deadly listeria [_Listeria
monocytogenes_] bacteria.

Five Queenslanders are known to have contracted listeriosis food
poisoning after consuming the wraps, including the 2 women who gave
birth prematurely, a known complication of the illness. Both women
and their babies survived.

Virgin Blue public affairs manager Heather Jeffery said 3 other
companies had received the apparently tainted chicken meat.
Queensland Health refused to name them last night [6 Aug 2009], but
said that there had been no other reports of listeria poisoning.

"There was an ingredient in a batch ... of chicken meat which was
supplied to our caterers, which was then supplied to us," Ms Jeffery
said. Virgin Blue said it withdrew the chicken wraps at the end of
June [2009], but health authorities say more cases could emerge,
given that the incubation for listeria poisoning is up to 70 days.
Queensland Health is warning pregnant women who fear they could be
victims of the food scare to see their doctor.

Queensland Health says there has been a spike in listeriosis cases
this year [2009], with 9 recorded in Queensland and 56 across
Australia. Listeriosis symptoms include fever, headache, tiredness,
aches and pains, diarrhoea, nausea, and abdominal cramps. More severe
cases may lead to meningitis or septicemia.

Virgin Blue said the tainted chicken wraps were offered on services
along the east coast of Australia, to New Zealand and Bali, and out
of Brisbane and the Gold Coast. Potentially, up to 5000 flights were involved.

"It appears the likely source of the contamination was an ingredient
supplied to the manufacturers of the wraps and not Virgin Blue or
other companies who received the affected products," the airline
said. Queensland Health chief officer Jeannette Young said the
illness was not transmitted from person to person. "Listeria
infection is uncommon and causes few symptoms, if any, in healthy
people," Dr Young said. "However, it can be very dangerous for people at risk."

Several people purporting to be Virgin passengers went on talkback
radio in Brisbane yesterday [6 Aug 2009] saying they had been made
ill by chicken wraps eaten on flights in April and January [2009].
The airline and Queensland Health authorities are urging anyone who
fears they were at risk to see doctor.

[The news release above states that a contaminated ingredient in a
batch of chicken meat made into wraps and supplied by airline
caterers in May and June 2009 is the suspected source for the
outbreak of listeriosis among airline passengers. The airline
withdrew the implicated food at the end of June. What the ingredient
was, or how the contamination was determined is not indicated. The
news release also says that several airline passengers complained of
being made "ill" by chicken wraps eaten on flights in April and
January (2009), before the listeria-contaminated chicken was served.
The news release states, in addition, that 3 other companies,
presumably airlines, had also received the tainted chicken meat, but
gives no further data, except that there were "no other reports of
listeria poisoning."

The following is extracted from Mod.ML's comments in ProMED-mail post
Listeriosis, fatal - Chile: (Santiago) meat susp, RFI 20090411.1391:

"_Listeria monocytogenes_, the cause of listeriosis, is widely
distributed in nature. The organism can be found in soil, water,
silage, raw vegetables, raw meat and poultry, raw and pasteurized
milk, soft cheeses, kitchen premises, and in the intestinal tract of
many animals, including cattle, sheep, and humans, and in
crustaceans, fish, shellfish, ticks, and insects.

Most human infections are foodborne, although vertical transmission
can occur from mother to fetus transplacentally or during delivery
through an infected birth canal, and localized skin infections can
occur in veterinarians and farmers by direct contact with infected animals.

Contamination of food can occur in nature, such as, raw vegetables
contaminated by soil and manure, and raw milk from infected cows; or
contamination may occur following subsequent cooking or other
processing. Because the organisms can multiply at refrigerator
temperatures, it is not surprising that listeriosis is usually
associated with ingestion of contaminated milk, meat or vegetable
products that have been held at refrigeration temperatures.

Listeriosis is more severe in newborns, pregnant women, people 60
years of age or older, and those with compromised immune defenses. A
detailed discussion of listeriosis can be found in ProMED-mail post
20071230.4186."
