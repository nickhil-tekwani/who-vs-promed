["Varroosis is caused by a mite, an external parasite of adults and brood. There are 4 species of varroa mite, but _Varroa destructor_ is the most important. They are found throughout the world except for Australia and the South Island of New Zealand. Known to spread a virus that causes deformed wing disease, adult bees affected with varroosis also have shrunken abdomens. Early signs of infection normally go unnoticed, and only when infection is heavy does it become apparent, with adult mites being seen on bees. The infection spreads by direct contact from adult bee to adult bee, and by the movement of infested bees and bee brood. The mite can also act as a vector for viruses of the honey bee"
(https://www.oie.int/en/disease/diseases-of-bees/).

Detailed information of the _V. destructor_'s life cycle, population dynamics, and clinical signs is available at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.02.07_VARROOSIS.pdf
