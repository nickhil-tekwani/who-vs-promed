At least 100 cows in Ngoma district of Eastern province have died from Rift Valley fever (RVF) in recent weeks. The disease has also spread to the nearby Kirehe district [also in Eastern province], The New Times has learnt.

RVF is an acute fever-causing viral disease that's commonly observed in domesticated animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, and camels. It can also attack wild animals such as buffaloes. The disease is caused by a virus transmitted by mosquitoes and blood feeding flies and mostly affects animals but it can also be transmitted to humans, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). In humans, the disease ranges from a mild flu-like illness to severe haemorrhagic fever that can be deadly.

Ngoma district vice mayor for Finance and Economic Development, Jean-Marie Vianney Rwiririza, told The New Times on [Tue 5 Jun 2018] that 102 cows had died from the fatal disease, while 103 others have aborted since the disease was first reported in the district on [18 May 2018].

WHO says RVF can cause significant economic losses due to high mortality rate among young animals and waves of abortions. The virus was first identified in 1931 among sheep on a farm in the Rift Valley of Kenya.

The vice mayor for Finance and Economic Planning of Kirehe, Jean-Damasc√®ne Nsengiyumva, said that about 16 cows in the district had been successfully treated of the infection while 22 were still undergoing treatment. "We are vaccinating cows which have not yet been infected and treating those infected," Nsengiyumva told The New Times.

A dairy farmer from Kirehe sector in Kirehe district, lost a cow to the disease just a day after it got infected. The cow, which he bought for Rwf 600 000 [about USD 700] in August 2015, he said, was producing 20 litres of milk a day and was helping him fend for his family. He says the cow's value had since increased to about Rwf 2 million [about USD 2330].

Officials at Rwanda Agriculture Board [RAB] say that RVF was first recorded in Rwanda in 2011 and the government started vaccinating cows against the disease in 2015. The vaccines are provided free of charge.

Dr Isidore Gafarasi, the director of veterinary services at RAB, said some districts did not vaccinate their cows against the viral disease fast enough, adding that both Ngoma and Kirehe districts had a target to inoculate 7500 cattle each. Under the Veterinary Delivery Services/ Livestock Development project, the government set aside some Rwf 500 million [about USD 583 000] for the current financial year (2017/18) for RVF vaccines for 127 793 cows in all of the country's 30 districts.

A restriction has been imposed on cattle movement in the affected region to help contain the viral disease. Consumption of the affected meat is prohibited because the disease can be transmitted to humans.

[The reporting of RVF cases in cattle may have contributed to the high alert of the public health authorities. Unfortunately, in most RVF events, humans serve as sentinels. Having said that, one may consider the possibility of mild or subclinical human cases escaping reporting since the start of the event in cattle, reportedly on 18 May 2018.

According to Rwanda's reports to the OIE, RVF -- a notifiable, endemic animal disease in Rwanda -- is (2017 data) "limited to one or more zones". FAO's [The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations] recent suitability maps for RVF vector amplification indicate risk areas in the eastern parts of Rwanda.

According to Rwanda's semi-annual reports to the OIE for 2017, during the months January-June, 321 730 vaccinations "in response to outbreaks" were applied in animals; during July-December 2017, the number was 32 650.

A detailed vaccination report to OIE is available for 2016, indicating the number of vaccine doses used: cattle: 127 000, goats: 75 700, sheep & goats (likely, mixed flocks): 56 750. It may be assumed that the vaccine used for the animal vaccination is live-attenuated.

Subscribers are referred to FAO's recent publication on RVF Surveillance (Ref 1). On top of the crucial surveillance issue, the richly-referenced document includes updated information and guidelines on the RVF control and prevention measures in affected and threatened countries. Vaccination regimes in different epidemiological situations, are revisited by the author. All involved with the surveillance, control, and prevention of RVF, a significant human and animal-health threat, will gain from this timely publication.

The population of RVF-susceptible animals in Rwanda (OIE's 2016 data) is:
- cattle: 1 214 244 in 374 000 establishments;
- goats: 2 486 334 in 103 500 establishments;
- sheep: 637 068 in 15 000 establishments;
- camels: 12 (a single establishment).

RVF is known to be currently circulating in 2 other East African countries, affecting animals and humans: earlier, South Sudan and, more recently, Kenya, where human cases have been suspected (20180609.5847216) and a serious outbreak in camels, officially reported on Fri 8 Jun 2018. The situation in other regional countries, in particular Uganda and Tanzania, is to be followed with caution.
