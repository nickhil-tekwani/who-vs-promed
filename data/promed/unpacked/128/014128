New official disease status recognized by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE)
-----------------------------------------------
"Two countries were the first to receive the endorsement of their dog-mediated rabies control programs and 13 new official disease statuses were recognized by OIE delegates.

"Paris, 27 May 2021 - Namibia and the Philippines are the first 2 countries with OIE-endorsed official control programs for dog-mediated rabies. It is the 1st time that OIE members could apply for such approbation by the OIE World Assembly. This is a great move forward in the fight against this disease, which still kills nearly 60 000 people every year. Having gathered evidence that their official control programs comply with OIE international standards, Namibia and the Philippines will be able to advocate for support from their governments to progressively prevent and control the disease. The ultimate objective will be to eventually eliminate the disease from their territories and self-declare its freedom, thus contributing to the 'Zero by 30' global goal to eliminate human deaths from dog-mediated rabies.

"OIE members can submit on a voluntary basis their official control programs for 4 diseases for endorsement by the OIE. They can also apply for the official recognition of animal health status for 6 priority diseases. Applications are reviewed through a very detailed process, which evaluates the sanitary measures in place and compliance of the Member with the OIE international standards. In some cases, in-country missions are conducted. In the current particular context linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, some adaptations have been made to ensure the continuity in the evaluation of countries' applications, notably thanks to the implementation of virtual interviews. The recognition of official disease status plays a key role in the livestock economy of countries as it contributes to facilitate regional and international trade of animals and animal products, notably in the context of negotiations according to the SPS Agreement of the World Trade Organization (WTO).

"New official disease status delivered to OIE Members in 2021:

"Disease / Status / Country or zone with new status
--------------------------
Classical swine fever / Free / Brazil (one zone), Colombia (one zone)
Foot and mouth disease / Free (where vaccination is not practiced) / Brazil (3 zones)
Foot and mouth disease / Free (where vaccination is practiced) / Colombia (one zone), Russia (2 zones)
Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia / Free / Italy, Paraguay
Peste des petits ruminants / Free / North Macedonia (Republic of)

[A request for OIE official disease status can be made for 6 diseases: (African horse sickness (AHS), classical swine fever (CSF), peste des petits ruminants (PPR), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) and foot and mouth disease (FMD). All these diseases are of major importance to OIE members.

During the 88th General Session of the World Assembly of Delegates held virtually (for the first time ever) during the last week of May 2021 [24-28 May 2021], OIE granted official status recognitions for CSF, PPR, BSE, CBPP and FMD to several member countries.

ProMED would like to congratulate those countries which reached and/or advanced their status for classical swine fever, peste des petits ruminants, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia and foot and mouth disease status. We recognize the efforts invested by the respective country animal health professionals (both private and public) as well as the associated allied industries, and we congratulate them for attaining their new status, especially considering the unprecedented and difficult times during this past year.
