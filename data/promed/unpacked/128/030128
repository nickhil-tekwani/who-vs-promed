A woman from Maine's midcoast area is being treated for a rare tickborne illness that in severe cases can cause neurological damage. In an update issued today [19 Dec 2013], state health officials say the woman, who has not been identified, is hospitalized with what's thought to be Powassan encephalitis. Maine Center for Disease Control Director Dr Sheila Pinette says, if confirmed, it would be the 1st documented case of the illness in Maine since 2004. Pinette says the woman was diagnosed with the illness in early December [2013]. She had no travel history, so Pinette says the disease was acquired locally.

The virus is transmitted by a bite from an infected tick. Officials say ticks in the adult stage can remain active through the winter when the temperature rises to 40 deg F [4.5 deg C] or above. Symptoms of Powassan include fever, headache, vomiting, weakness, confusion, seizures, and memory loss. The infection can also lead to long-term neurologic problems, Pinette says. There's no specific treatment for Powassan, but those with severe cases often require hospitalization. She says several other tickborne diseases can also be spread during the warmer days of winter, including Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, and babesiosis. Pinette says people should continue to take steps to avoid tick bites, such as wearing protective clothing, applying an EPA-approved insect repellent, and doing frequent body checks for ticks.

[Human Powassan (POW) virus infections have been recognized in the United States, Canada, and Russia. In the United States, cases of POW virus disease have been reported primarily from north eastern states and the Great Lakes region. These cases occur primarily in the late spring, early summer, and mid-fall, when ticks are most active.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (http://www.cdc.gov/powassan/): Powassan (POW) virus is transmitted to humans by infected ticks. About 50 cases of POW virus disease were reported in the United States over the past 10 years. Most cases have occurred in the Northeast and Great Lakes region. Signs and symptoms of infection can include fever, headache, vomiting, weakness, confusion, seizures, and memory loss. Long-term neurological problems may occur. There is no specific treatment, but people with severe POW virus illnesses often need to be hospitalized to receive respiratory support, intravenous fluids, or medications.

Reports of Powassan virus infection seem to have been more frequent in the current year (2013), but that may reflect enhanced diagnostic ability rather than an increased incidence of infection. - Mod.CP
