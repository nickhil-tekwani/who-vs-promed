New numbers that were just released show the amount of hepatitis A cases in Indiana are still growing. Just this week, there were 2 more cases reported in Lawrence County, which brings the total number of people infected to 28. In the state, 202 are reported with hepatitis A.

FOX59 News reports a Bedford man is bedridden after contracting the virus. The health department says they are working to figure out how he became infected. The individual reported says he had recently eaten at 2 of the 4 restaurants where the Lawrence County Health Department confirms that employees sick with hepatitis A handled food.

Friday afternoon, 6 Jul 2018, the state department of health told FOX59 they "have not identified any cases of hepatitis that we believe to be transmitted from a food handler." The department assured us that they "evaluate all restaurant and food exposures, along with other risk factors, for cases of hepatitis A."

As the outbreak continues, the Lawrence County Health Department urges everyone to get vaccinated, including anyone who ate at the restaurants where cases were confirmed. Those restaurants include the Bedford Burger King, Mamma's restaurant, Marco's Pizza, and the Papa John's in Mitchell.

According to the health department, a Papa John's employee infected with the virus delivered packaged food to the Mitchell location on 12 and 15 Jun 2018. Health officials say a Bedford Burger King employee handled food while ill on 15-24 May 2018. An employee at Mamma's restaurant handled food while ill on 8-9 Jun 2018. Back in April 2018, Marco's Pizza in Bedford confirms an employee was ill and working with the virus. The department says all of the people who ate at those restaurants during that time frame should monitor for symptoms of hepatitis A for at least 50 days.

Cabell County's number of confirmed hepatitis A cases rose by 29 percent this week to 94, up from 73 last week and more than doubling from 44 cases 2 weeks ago, according to the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources. In Wayne County, 15 cases have been confirmed, up slightly from 11 last week.

As of Friday, 6 Jul 2018, 451 confirmed cases of hepatitis A have been reported in West Virginia, with 259 in Kanawha County alone, according to the DHHR. Putnam County has reported 55 cases. Men make up 56.5 percent of hepatitis A contractions in West Virginia, which has been diagnosed in residents aged 14 to 82.

These statewide cases have since been definitively linked to the virus strain found nationwide in an ongoing, multi-state hepatitis A outbreak that also is affecting Kentucky and Indiana.

In response to the ongoing outbreak, the Cabell-Huntington Health Department will host a public forum at 5:30 p.m. on Thu 19 Jul 2018 at 703 7th Ave. in Huntington. Public health officials will field questions and share their understanding about the risks of the current hepatitis A outbreak. The department has advised those with liver diseases such as hepatitis B or C, cirrhosis and other similar ailments consider receiving the vaccine, as the disease tends to affect those groups more severely. People at the highest risk for contracting and spreading the disease include those living without sanitary facilities, people who use drugs and those who travel to areas of the world where the disease is common.

Due to the hepatitis A outbreaks within the tri-state area of Kentucky, West Virginia, and Ohio, several restaurant chains have implemented preventative measures for their staff. Sarah Osment, director of Strategic Accounts, Large Mouth Communications, explained that local Golden Corral restaurants are activating preventive measures such as immunization programs and daily reinforcement of proactive sanitizing measures.

Jace Stickdorn, managing director for Platinum Corral, stated, "As a preventive measure, we recently implemented a voluntary, free-of-charge hepatitis A vaccination program for all of our employees at the following Golden Corral locations: 304 Upper River Road, Gallipolis, Ohio; 1302 Garfield Avenue, Parkersburg; 3761 North Pointe Drive, Zanesville, Ohio; 2296 N. Memorial Drive, Lancaster, Ohio; 1660 N. Bridge Street, Chillicothe, Ohio. This was implemented in collaboration and communication with the Gallia County Health Department, Mid-Ohio Valley Health Department, Zanesville-Muskingum County Health Department, Fairfield Department of Health and Ross County Health Department.

In addition, the chain is hosting daily meetings with staff to reinforce proactive sanitation measures, including regular-interval hand washing and utensil sanitation. This is in addition to the program implemented in May 2018 in collaboration and communication with the Ashland Boyd County Health Department, Cabell-Huntington Health Department and Greenup County Health Department. "The health and well-being of our guests and employees are top priorities at Golden Corral," stated Stickdorn.

Also, Jennifer Thomas, nursing director and administrator at the Mason County Health Department, stated in a previous article that restaurants within Mason County started requiring their employees to get the hepatitis A vaccination as well. Thomas recommends individuals regularly wash their hands, as the disease is communicable.

Individuals can contact their primary physicians as well as their local health departments and pharmacies to ask about possible means of getting a hepatitis A immunization.

The Meigs County Health Department has advised, as part of its weekly immunization clinic announcement on Thu 5 Jul 2018, that "The Ohio Department of Health (ODH) does NOT recommend routine hepatitis A vaccination of healthcare workers. Additionally, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) does NOT recommend routine hepatitis A vaccination for food workers. Currently, ODH is strongly recommending the following groups get the hepatitis A vaccine: men who have sex with men, persons who inject drugs, and person who use illegal non-injection drugs. These are the highest risk groups for transmission of hepatitis A."

[It is an excellent idea that the Golden Corral chain is now offering no-cost HAV vaccination to its employees. While formal recommendations are not in place for routine HAV immunizations, spillover of current substantial and growing outbreaks of hepatitis A into the food handler cohort continue to occur:

Taco Bell worker in Napoleon has Hepatitis A; vaccine recommended for diners
http://www.wtol.com/story/38589074/taco-bell-worker-in-napoleon-has-hepatitis-a-vaccine-recommended-for-diners

Universal immunization for HAV in childhood has not been functioning long enough, so most adults in the USA, especially if born in the USA, are susceptible to the virus. Other than for monetary reasons, it is not clear why policies are not in effect so that all food service workers are immunized against HAV. Healthcare workers are required to have influenza vaccine to protect the public; why are we not protecting unsuspecting diners against HAV? - Mod.LL
