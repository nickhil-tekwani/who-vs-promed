Illness caused by pet prairie dogs is possibly monkeypox
-----------------------
MADISON, Wis. (AP) - A virus related to smallpox that has never been
detected in the Western Hemisphere may be the cause of a mysterious
disease spreading from pet prairie dogs to people across the upper
Midwest, health officials said Saturday.
Dr. James Hughes, director of the National Center for Infectious
Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said a
group of prairie dogs sold from a suburban Chicago pet distributor
appears to be infected with the monkeypox virus, a member of the same
viral family that causes smallpox but is not nearly as deadly.
Monkeypox has typically been found in West African rain forests,
Hughes said. The death rate among infected humans has ranged from 1
to 10 percent.
Hughes said although monkeypox is spread primarily through rodents in
Africa, scientists haven't ruled out person-to-person transmission.
"We're in the very early stages of classifying this virus," Hughes
said. "We're not certain."
Since early May [2003] , 17 possible cases have been reported in
Wisconsin in people as young as 4 and as old as 48. 2 possible cases
have been reported in Illinois and one has been reported in Indiana,
health officials from all 3 states said.
They appeared to have been exposed to prairie dogs - rodents whose
popularity as pets has grown in recent years. They reported fever,
coughs, rashes and swollen lymph nodes.
CDC and state health officials are still researching the disease with
samples from the infected prairie dogs and humans, but the virus
appears susceptible to the anti-viral drug Cidofovir, Hughes said. He
isn't aware of any long-term aftereffects of monkeypox.
No one has died or become severely ill in the current outbreak,
Hughes said. But 4 people in Wisconsin had to be hospitalized at
Froedtert Memorial Lutheran Hospital, hospital spokesman Mark
McLaughlin said. 2 remained hospitalized in satisfactory condition
Saturday.
Authorities don't believe bioterrorism was involved. Investigators
have traced the origin of the outbreak to a pet distributor in
Villa Park, Ill. That distributor had a giant Gambian rat, indigenous
to African countries, that may have infected batches of prairie dogs,
Hughes said.
SK Exotics, a South Milwaukee pet distributor, bought prairie dogs
from the Villa Park distributor and imported them to Wisconsin.
2 pet stores, Hoffer TropicLife Pets in Milwaukee and Rainbow Pets in
Shorewood, a Milwaukee suburb, bought some dogs from SK Exotics.
More prairie dogs from Villa Park found their way to northern
Wisconsin through a Wausau swap meet, said Dr. Mark Wegner, chief of
the Wisconsin Communicable Disease Epidemiology Section.
Wisconsin agriculture officials have taken several emergency steps
since word of the outbreak broke earlier this week.
The state Department of Health and Family Services issued an
emergency order Friday banning the sale, importation and display of
prairie dogs.
Also Friday, acting state veterinarian Dr. Robert Ehlenfeldt imposed
quarantines on SK Exotics, Hoffer TropicLife Pets, Rainbow Pets and
the Dorchester home of Tammy Kautzer, who apparently sells animals to
swap meets, Gilson said.
The quarantines prohibit movement of any prairie dogs or mammals that
come in contact with them.
[One of the cases] said she got 2 female prairie dogs from SK Exotics
on 5 May 2003. Neither looked sick at first, she said, but one
eventually began to look tired. [She] said she got sick in mid-May
with blisters, coughing and a
101-degree fever. Hospital staff gave her aspirin, told her it was a
viral infection and she went home, she said.
Meanwhile, state and federal investigators are still trying to track
down animals sold from the Villa Park distributor. The source of the
Gambian rat is still unknown, they said.
The World Health Organization has released facts about the disease:
a. The disease has never before been reported in the Western Hemisphere.
b. It is usually found in remote villages in Central and West Africa.
c. Monkeypox is related to the virus that caused smallpox, and smallpox
vaccinations also gave protection against it.
d. The death rate among those with monkeypox ranges from 1 to 10
percent, with the highest rates among young children.
e. The disease is usually transmitted to people from squirrels and
primates through a bite or contact with the animal's blood.

Public Health Investigation Uncovers First Outbreak of Human
Monkeypox Infection in Western Hemisphere
------------------------------
Public health officials from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) and the states of Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana
have reported the first outbreak of human infections with a
monkeypox-like virus to be documented in the Western Hemisphere. Thus
far, 19 cases have been reported: 17 in Wisconsin, one in Northern
Illinois, and one in Northern Indiana. All patients who have become
ill reported direct or close contact with ill prairie dogs.
CDC is advising physicians, veterinarians, and the public to report
instances of rash illness associated with exposure to prairie dogs,
Gambian rats and other animals to local and state public health
authorities. CDC also has issued interim recommendations for
infection control calling for health care personnel attending
hospitalized patients to follow standard precautions for guarding
against airborne or contact illness. Veterinarians examining or
treating sick rodents, rabbits and such exotic pets as prairie dogs
and Gambian rats are advised to use personal protective equipment,
including gloves, surgical mask or N-95 respirator, and gowns.
The prairie dogs were sold by a Milwaukee animal distributor in May
to two pet shops in the Milwaukee area and during a pet swap meet
(pets for sale or exchange) in northern Wisconsin. The Milwaukee
animal distributor obtained prairie dogs and a Gambian giant rat that
was ill at the time from a northern Illinois animal distributor.
Investigations are underway to trace the source of animals and the
subsequent distribution of animals from the Illinois distributor.
Preliminary information suggests that animals from this distributor
may have been sold in several other states.
Human monkeypox is a rare, zoonotic, viral disease that occurs
primarily in the rain forest countries of Central and West Africa. It
is a member of the orthopox family of viruses. In humans, infection
with monkeypox virus results in a rash illness similar to but less
infectious than smallpox. Monkeypox in humans is not usually fatal.
The incubation period is about 12 days. Animal species susceptible to
monkeypox virus may include non-human primates, rabbits, and some
rodents.
Scientists at the Marshfield Clinic in Marshfield, Wisconsin,
recovered the first viral isolates from a patient and a prairie dog.
Through examination with an electron microscope they demonstrated a
poxvirus.
Physicians should consider monkeypox in persons with fever, cough,
headache, myalgia, rash, or lymph node enlargement within 3 weeks
after contact with prairie dogs or Gambian giant rats. Veterinarians
examining sick exotic animal species, especially prairie dogs and
Gambian giant rats, should consider the possibility of monkeypox.
Veterinarians should also be alert to the development of illness in
other animal species that may have been housed with ill prairie dogs
or Gambian giant rats.
Local, state, and federal agencies and private institutions that have
participated in this investigation to date have included the
Marshfield Clinic and Marshfield Laboratories, Froedtert Hospital and
Medical College of Wisconsin, the City of Milwaukee Health Department
and at least 10 additional health departments in Wisconsin and
Illinois, the Wisconsin Division of Public Health, Wisconsin
Department of Agriculture Trade and Consumer Protection and Wisconsin
State Laboratory of Hygiene, the Illinois Department of Public
Health, the Illinois State Department of Agriculture, the Indiana
State Department of Health, and the US Department of Agriculture.

[As mentioned in the above reports, this is the first identification
of monkeypox in the Western Hemisphere. In the article by Hutin YJF,
Williams RJ, Malfait P, Pebody R. et al, Outbreak of Human Monkeypox,
Democratic Republic of Congo, 1996 to 1997. EID Vol. 7, No. 3 MayJun
2001, (accessible at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no3/hutin.htm#Figure%201>), Table
2 (Species of animals caught in the wild and monkeypox virus plaque
reduction neutralization antibody assay results, Katako-Kombe Health
Zone, 23-27 Feb, 1997) shows that 3 out of 19 (15.8 percent) Gambian
rats (_Cricetomys emini_) tested had evidence of monkeypox infection.
Given this, it would not be surprising to learn that the Gambian rat
mentioned in the above articles was the source of the infection of
the prairie dogs. I wonder when and how it arrived on US shores, and
if it was in the incubation period during transit... or if there has
been an ongoing slow outbreak among these exotic animals for some
time that is just coming to notice now that it is spilling over into
the human population.
As per the newswire report, cases have occurred in individuals ages 4
through 48. It will be very interesting to see the real age
distribution of these cases, to see if there is persistent immunity
from earlier smallpox vaccination (pre-1972). It will also be of
interest to know the smallpox vaccination status of the cases that
occurred in individuals born before 1972 when smallpox vaccination
was discontinued (a possible natural study on the duration of
immunity from earlier smallpox vaccination in the USA). The
cessation of smallpox vaccination has been associated with an
observed increase in monkeypox activity in central Africa (see EID
article above and WHO fact sheet information below).
Monkeypox is a viral disease with a clinical presentation in humans
similar to that seen in the past in smallpox patients. Monkeypox is
seen as a sporadic disease in parts of Africa. The virus responsible
for monkeypox is related to the virus that causes smallpox
(orthopoxviruses). Vaccination against smallpox gave protection
against monkeypox. Before the eradication of smallpox, vaccination
was widely practised and protected against both diseases. However,
children born after 1980 have not been vaccinated against smallpox
and are likely to be more susceptible to monkeypox than older members
of the population. The death rate from monkeypox is highest in young
children, reaching about 10 percent.
Most cases occur in remote villages of Central and West Africa close
to tropical rainforests where there is frequent contact with infected
animals. Monkeypox is usually transmitted to humans from squirrels
and primates through contact with the animal's blood or through a
bite.
An outbreak of human monkeypox in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) in 1997 was associated with person-to-person
transmission; a change from prior limited outbreaks. Previous
studies over a twenty-year period had shown that the rate of
transmission of monkeypox within households was low, suggesting that
the disease had a low potential for transmission from person to
person. Outbreaks were generally self-limiting after one or two
sequential transmissions.
The percentage of suspect cases from person-to-person transmission
(78 percent) was higher in this outbreak than previously reported (30
percent). This was associated with the clustering of cases in
household compounds and prolonged chains of transmission from person
to person;
The ending of vaccination programmes against smallpox in the late
1970s has probably led to an increase in susceptibility to monkeypox
and could explain the larger size of the most recent outbreak, the
higher proportion of patients aged 15 and over, and the spread
through many generations of transmission. (see WHO fact sheet at:
<http://www.who.int/inf-fs/en/fact161.html>).
We await further information on this outbreak. - Mod.MPP]
