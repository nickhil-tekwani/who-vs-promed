Ongoing outbreak of mumps infection in Oban, Scotland, November 2010

Summary
-------------
We report on an ongoing outbreak of 119 cases of mumps virus
infection in the Oban area of Scotland, from 29 Nov 2010 to 31 Jan
2011. The median age of cases was 20 years, with the highest incidence
in the 13-19-year-olds. A total of 53 cases had received 2 doses of
measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, in accordance with the United
Kingdom vaccination schedule, while 33 had received only one dose, and
30 had not been vaccinated.

Outbreak description
------------------
NHS [National Health Service] Highland Health Protection Team in
Scotland was notified on 29 Nov 2010 of one case of mumps in Oban, a
rural coastal town, with a population of around 8000, on the west
coast of Scotland. There were no further cases for a 2-week period,
but by 20 Dec 2010, an outbreak in Oban was obvious, with 23 cases.
Many of the cases were notified around the Christmas holiday period
when young people returned from work and university in urban areas.

By 31 Jan 2011, a total of 119 cases had been notified in the Oban
area. These represented more notifications than for the rest of
Scotland for the same period (90 cases in a population of 5 168 500
individuals). Of the 119 cases notified in Oban, 18 were laboratory
confirmed, and 101 were clinically diagnosed by local GPs (based on
those presenting with typical clinical features, including parotitis
after 29 Nov 2010).

Background
-----------
Mumps, an infection caused by a paramyxovirus, is characterised by
parotitis. It may also cause orchitis, pancreatitis and meningitis,
among other clinical features. In Scotland, mumps is a notifiable
disease and is reported electronically to health boards by clinicians,
in particular by general practitioners.

Mumps immunisation was introduced in the United Kingdom (UK) in 1988
as a single dose of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, for those
aged 12-15 months. Before 1988, mumps virus caused outbreaks among
5-9-year-olds every 3 years. They would now be aged 23 years and over.
In 1996, a 2-dose schedule was introduced: the 1st dose is given to
children aged 13 months, and the 2nd dose is given from the age of 3
years and 4 months onwards.

Current vaccination uptake rates for the 1st dose of MMR vaccine at
24 months (for the year ending 31 Mar 2010) were 93.7 percent for
Scotland and 91.5 percent for the Argyll area (in which Oban is
located). However, in the years post 1998, following a vaccine
controversy which involved an alleged link between autism and the MMR
vaccine, the uptake rates fell, reaching a low level in Scotland of
88.5 percent and in Argyll of 85.6 percent in 2003. This cohort, who
would have been due vaccination in 1998-2003, would now be 8-14 years
old.

Following a large outbreak of mumps which affected the whole of the
UK in 2005, the number of cases fell until 2009, when an increase was
seen again. In Scotland, this increase has been characterised by
periodic, localised occurrences of mumps cases: the outbreak reported
here is the latest. Recently, there have been reports of outbreaks of
mumps in other parts of the UK and other countries.

Case information
----------------
Of the 119 cases, 63 were females and 56 males. The age range of
cases was 4 to 71 years: 85 of the cases were in the 13-29 age group,
and 12 were aged over 40 years. Anecdotal information revealed 3 cases
with complications (orchitis, pancreatitis). However, more detailed
information on complications overall is currently being evaluated.

By 31 Jan 2011, vaccination status was known for 116 of the 119
cases: 53 had received 2 doses of MMR vaccine, 33 had received only
one dose, and 30 received no doses. For those who had one dose, the
date of vaccination ranged from 5 Dec 1988 to 23 Feb 2009. For those
who had received 2 doses, the vaccination dates ranged from 28 Sep
1989 for the 1st dose to 13 May 2008 for the 2nd dose.

The majority of the cases aged under 22 years had received 2 doses of
MMR vaccine (53 of 80). Among the 9 cases aged 12 years or under, 8
had received 2 doses; among the 49 cases aged between 13 and 19 years,
37 had received 2 doses and 11 one dose.

Anecdotally, it appears that the index case may have been a student
at one of Scotland's main universities who had returned home for the
holidays. Many of the initial cases had subsequently attended a school
dance and a large party in Oban. There was no common link with place
of residence.

Cases continue to be notified, but the rate of notifications has
decreased. The peak date of symptom onset for cases was 10 Jan 2011,
when 11 cases were notified. By 31 Jan 2011, there were 18
laboratory-confirmed cases; the rest were clinically diagnosed.

Discussion
----------
Some GPs reported that not all those affected presented to GP
practices, and our numbers may, therefore, be an underestimate. On the
other hand, we applied a non-specific case definition which led to
wide inclusion of cases.

Initial concerns regarding a historical problem with a vaccine batch
were soon discarded as the date ranges for the 1st and 2nd
vaccinations were wide, and vaccinations were given in different
practices by different individuals, and there was no link with any
particular vaccine batch numbers.

The main limitation in our study is the low number of
laboratory-confirmed cases. We felt that after the initial tranche of
cases, clinical diagnosis was adequate, and this was undertaken by
several different primary care teams (101 of the 119 were clinically
diagnosed). The laboratory has confirmed that the strain involved is
genotype G5, in common with all strains currently seen in the UK.

MMR vaccination coverage was affected by adverse publicity some years
ago, and uptake rates fell to a low of 85.6 percent in 2003 in the
Oban area. Unvaccinated individuals, plus those who were immunised but
in whom protection had subsequently waned, combined to provide a
cohort of vulnerable individuals who were infected in this outbreak.
The 45 percent (n=53) of notified cases who had received 2 doses of
MMR vaccine is higher than the 29 percent of cases reported in England
and Wales in 2010 and the 31 percent reported in England in 2004-05
but lower than the 61 percent noted in the Netherlands in 2010 and the
75 percent reported in New Jersey, United States in 2009-10. If we
look at the 13-19 years age group in our study -- the most affected
age group -- 76 percent (n=37) had received 2 doses of MMR.

Published estimates of MMR vaccine efficacy to protect against mumps
vary. It has been reported as 88 percent (95 percent confidence
intervals (CI): 83 percent to 91 percent) for one dose and 95 percent
(95 percent CI: 93 percent to 96 percent) for 2 doses. In addition, 2
doses of vaccine were reported as being more effective (88 percent (95
percent CI: 62 percent to 96 percent)) than a single dose (64 percent
(95 percent CI: 40 percent to 78 percent)). Furthermore, waning
immunity in older vaccinated individuals has been reported.

Although the numbers in our cohort are small, they add to the growing
body of evidence which suggests that immunity to mumps virus may wane
over time. These cases highlight the importance of ensuring high
uptake of the recommended 2 doses of MMR. They also imply a need for
further research into long-term mumps immunity among those partially
or fully vaccinated in order to inform future immunisation
programmes.

[Readers are recommended to read the full text of this report to view
the graphical presentation of the data and the specific references
cited. This analysis re-enforces the general observation that the
immunity conferred by the mumps component of the triple MMR vaccine is
less complete than that provided by the other 2 components.
