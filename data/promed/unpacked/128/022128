FUSARIUM HEAD BLIGHT, SMALL GRAIN CEREALS - UK: RE-EMERGENCE

BBSRC [UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council] is
advising farmers to change fungicide regimes to help prevent losses to
a destructive cereal disease. Fusarium ear blight (FEB) has the
potential to devastate a crop just weeks before harvest. Scientists at
Rothamsted Research, an institute of the BBSRC, have discovered
substantial symptomless infection in wheat ears, which means that
although the plant appears healthy the fungal infection could already
be beyond control. Hence, they are advising farmers to use fungicides
as a preventative measure rather than a curative approach.

It is believed that the re-emergence of FEB is driven by changes to
climate and agronomic practices. Besides dramatically reducing yield,
the grains are also contaminated with fungal toxin. Under EU
guidelines approximately one infected ear per square metre would be
sufficient for the harvest to be rejected. In 2008, 11.5 percent of
the [UK] wheat crop was found to be over the EU limit.

Attempts made to control the disease by traditional methods such as
plant breeding and fungicide treatments have not been fully effective.
Neil Brown (Rothamsted Research) revealed that when symptoms are
showing on a couple of spikelets, up to one third of the ear is
already fully infected.

At present assessments [of crops] are done by visible symptoms. This
could drastically underestimate disease levels and possibly mycotoxin
contamination. The research also has implications for commercial wheat
breeding, which currently relies on scoring visible symptoms and
determination of mycotoxin levels in the final grain.

[Fusarium head blight (FHB; also called ear blight, scab) of small
grain cereal crops (such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, maize) is caused
by several fungal species originally classed into the genus
_Fusarium_, accounting for the common name of this disease (current
species classification see link below). FHB causes yield losses of up
to 45 percent and reduces the grade of harvested grain. The disease is
favoured by humid conditions during flowering and early stages of
kernel development. Symptoms on wheat include premature bleaching of
infected spikelets, production of orange, spore-bearing structures at
the base of the glumes, and visibly affected kernels. During wet
weather, there may be whitish fungal growth on infected heads in the
field. The fungi may also cause seedling blight.

The fungi persist and multiply on infected crop residues. During moist
weather, spores are windblown or splashed onto the heads of cereal
crops. Stress conditions and lesions caused by other fungi or insects
are known to increase susceptibility of host plants to fusarium
diseases. Depending on the fungal species or strains involved, as well
as on environmental factors during plant growth and grain storage,
infection may also contaminate the grain with fungal toxins. The total
crop may be lost if grain is rejected because of toxin levels. Disease
management includes timely fungicide applications and crop varieties
with reduced susceptibility.

New FHB strains are emerging in North America (see ProMED-mail posts
20091210.4211 and 20100331.1017). Whether new strains (possibly
favoured by the altered environmental conditions mentioned above) may
also be involved in the re-emergence of the disease in the UK is not
clear from this report.
