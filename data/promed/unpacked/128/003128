Update on City Health Department investigation of illnesses on Staten Island
---------------------------------------
The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene today [12 Oct
2003] continued its investigation of illnesses in patients who were
hospitalized with symptoms consistent with what was suspected to be viral
encephalitis. One of the 5 patients was released from the hospital, and 2
patients were found to have underlying health conditions explaining their
illnesses. The 2 remaining patients are still in critical condition with
encephalitis-like symptoms. It is not known whether there is any connection
between the illnesses in these 2 patients, but the Health Department
continues to investigate. Preliminary tests for West Nile virus and Eastern
Equine Encephalitis, both mosquito-borne viruses, have come back negative.
"In our investigation this weekend, we have not found evidence of an
outbreak, nor have we found other similar cases of unexplained illness
beyond these 2 individuals on Staten Island," said Health Commissioner Dr.
Thomas R. Frieden. "Nonetheless, the Health Department will continue to
examine these illnesses to see if an explanation can be found."

[According to this press release, the earlier described cluster of 5 cases
has been further refined to be only 2 cases of unexplained neurologic
illness. One of the cases has been classified as due to meningitis
(according to newswires), and 2 of the cases have been determined to be
neurologic illness secondary to underlying disease. In addition, further
investigations in New York City have not as yet identified other cases of
similar unexplained neurologic illness, i.e., consistent with a diagnosis
of encephalitis. In addition, Eastern Equine Encephalitis and West Nile
virus have been preliminarily ruled out as the etiology of these
illnesses. We await more information on the etiology of these 2 cases of
encephalitis, as well as investigations in surrounding states to see
whether there have been additional cases of unexplained neurologic illness.
