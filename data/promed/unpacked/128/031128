[Ref: Philip ES: Occurrence of sugarcane ratoon stunting disease in Nyando sugar belt and its management by hot water treatment. University of Nairobi Research Archive, added 17 Nov 2016]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sugarcane yield in Kenya has been on decline due to many factors including pests and diseases. Ratoon stunting disease (RSD) caused by _Leifsonia xyli_ subsp. _xyli_ is considered to be the most serious disease of sugarcane worldwide because it can cause up to 50 per cent yield loss.

This study [had] the objective of determining the prevalence and incidence of RSD in Nyando sugar belt in Kisumu County. Sugarcane stalks above the age of 9 months were randomly selected from farms and the presence of RSD was detected by phase contrast microscope and tissue blot enzyme immunoassay.

The effect of hot water treatments for management of RSD was determined on 3 sugarcane varieties (CO421, D8484, KEN 83737) at 45 deg C [113 deg F], 50 deg C [122 deg F], 52 deg C [125.6 deg F], and 55 deg C [131 deg F] for 2 hours. Control cane was treated with water at room temperature. The treated cane was planted in the field and in the greenhouse.

RSD was found to be highly prevalent (67 per cent) with incidence of up to 25 per cent. All the 3 main varieties were found to have RSD incidences ranging from 10 to 35 per cent. Hot water treatment at 45, 50 and 52 deg C significantly reduced RSD and increased cane germination, cane and sucrose yield. Hot water treatment at 55 deg C completely eliminated RSD but significantly reduced germination and cane yield. The control setts were stunted and had low overall yield.

The widespread occurrence of RSD in Nyando sugar belt could be attributed to the use of infected setts [stem cuttings or sections of the stalk with one or mod buds, used as seed material], preference of old commercial sugarcane varieties, [and] low awareness of RSD.

[RSD of sugarcane is caused by the bacterium _Leifsonia xyli_ s.sp. _xyli_ (previously _Clavibacter xyli_ s.sp. _xyli_). It has only been reported from _Saccharum officinarum_ (the species grown commercially) and is considered one of the most important diseases affecting sugarcane production worldwide. Symptoms may include irregular stunting and general loss of vigour similar to the effects of external stresses, or some leaf necrosis in highly susceptible cane cultivars. Internal symptoms of nodal discolouration may be present, but do not develop adequately in all cane varieties. Thus, reliable diagnosis can be performed only by microscopy or molecular techniques. RSD can cause yield losses without an infection being noticed in the crop, and therefore disease incidence is often underestimated.

The pathogen is spread with contaminated planting setts and contaminated cutting tools. Several consecutive hot water treatments can be used to eliminate the pathogen from cuttings to set up disease-free nurseries for planting material. However, disease management must then include strict phytosanitary measures to minimise re-infection in the nursery and in the field. Some tolerant cane varieties are available, but they still support growth of the bacteria and
therefore do not eliminate the disease from the area.
