[In Kazakhstan, the annual incidence of human rabies is relatively high (0.4-0.9 cases per million inhabitants). Rabies is enzootic in about 20 percent of the country area, being maintained by wild and domestic animal species. The majority of human exposures comes from dogs. Of over a thousand cases of animal rabies reported in the country in the last decade, about 17 percent originates from wild carnivores (foxes, wolves and jackals).

There is an ongoing vaccination program in Kazakhstan. Thus, in order to prevent rabies all 14 regions where the disease has been registered, annual regular vaccination of cattle, sheep and goats, horses, camels, dogs, and cats is undertaken. For high risk areas, the present policy is to vaccinate all susceptible livestock and have a constant monitoring and vaccination of domestic and stray dogs and cats. It is also aimed to distribute vaccine widely to wildlife. In medium risk areas local vaccinations are undertaken in places where rabies had been registered in the last 3 years and monitoring of domestic and wild carnivores and local distribution of vaccine to wildlife.
