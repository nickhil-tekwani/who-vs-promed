A salmonellosis outbreak linked to California-based poultry producer Foster Farms' contaminated chicken appears to be over more than 17 months after it began, the CDC said on Thu 31 Jul 2014. The _Salmonella_ [enterica_ serotype] Heidelberg outbreak, which public health investigators say began on 1 Mar 2013 and ended 11 Jul 2014, made 634 people sick in 29 states and Puerto Rico, the agency said. Scientists identified 7 strains of the bacterium in the outbreak, including some that were resistant to antibiotics used to treat humans for illnesses other than salmonella.

"Epidemiologic, laboratory and trace-back investigations conducted by local, state and federal officials indicated that consumption of Foster Farms brand chicken was the source of this outbreak of _Salmonella_ Heidelberg infections," the CDC said in a statement. No deaths were reported. Of the cases reported, 38 percent of the people were hospitalized, a higher rate than in a typical _S._ Heidelberg outbreak, investigators said.

For more than a year, the outbreak has roiled both the company and federal regulators in a public health controversy that put a critical spotlight on Foster Farms' food-safety practices. Critics also questioned USDA investigators' apparent struggles to connect the dots between extremely ill consumers and chicken produced by one of the nation's largest chicken companies.

In 2013, the company said it began implementing a new USD 75 million food safety program to reduce salmonella contamination throughout the company, from farm to slaughterhouse. "Foster Farms remains committed to continuing its progress and leading the industry in food safety," the company told Reuters in a statement. Yet for much of the outbreak, the company publicly denied its chicken was to blame for making people sick. Proper cooking should have killed any salmonella on its meat, the company has said.

In early July 2014, the company announced a limited recall of chicken produced at its 3 plants in central California. Now, according to the CDC, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has determined that "measures undertaken by the firm to prevent salmonella contamination of raw chicken have been successful."

The news came on the same day the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced it will modernize its decades-old inspection methods for poultry in an attempt to crack down on food-borne illnesses such as salmonellosis. As part of this effort, the agency said, USDA's FSIS will require all poultry companies to take measures to prevent salmonella and campylobacter contamination rather than addressing contamination after it occurs.

"The United States has been relying on a poultry inspection model that dates back to 1957. ... The system we are announcing today [1 Aug 2014] imposes stricter requirements on the poultry industry and places our trained inspectors where they can better ensure food is being processed safely," said USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture rejected a petition on Thu 31 Jul 2014 to ban antibiotic-resistant strains of salmonella, the nation's leading food poisoning bug after norovirus. In a letter, the department told the Center for Science in the Public Interest that it needed more data to single out the strains as contaminants. The agency allows salmonella on raw poultry and meat, relying on consumers to kill the bacteria during cooking. The agency said there was no evidence that the antibiotic-resistant strains were resistant to heat.

The USDA "has no basis to conclude that properly cooking ground poultry, ground pork or ground lamb will not destroy salmonella, whether the strain is resistant or susceptible to antibiotics," the letter said.

The center, a well-known consumer advocacy group, petitioned the USDA 3 years ago, asking that it ban antibiotic-resistant strains of _S._ Hadar, Heidelberg, Newport and Typhimurium, which have all been associated with waves of illness, including the latest Foster Farms outbreak.

The center called the denial a setback. "USDA's failure to act on antibiotic-resistant strains of salmonella in the meat supply ignores vital information about the public health risk posed by these pathogens," said Caroline Smith DeWaal, the center's food safety director. "Despite numerous examples of outbreaks linked to resistant pathogens, USDA leaves consumers vulnerable to illnesses that carry a much greater risk of hard-to-treat infections, leading to hospitalization."

In 1994, the USDA banned a particularly virulent strain of _E. coli_, O157:H7, in ground beef. Then in 1999, it extended that the ban to non-intact beef products. And in 2011, the agency added 6 other _E. coli_ strains to the list, saying they cause serious illness and have a relatively low infectious dose.

Both the CDC and the WHO have sounded the alarm on antibiotic resistance, saying that, one day, simple infections could be deadly because physicians won't have any treatment options.

[It is interesting how defining an adulterant is different between enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ in beef and _Salmonella_ in chicken, despite the fact that both are commensals in their zoonotic host, can be killed by cooking, and are pathogenic in humans. In parallel, small turtles are illegal to sell, but small chicks are not, yet both can be vehicles for salmonellosis. - Mod.LL
