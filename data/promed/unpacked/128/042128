Virus kills 5 children in a Guatemalan indigenous community
--------------------------------------
A virus has affected the indigenous population in the west of the
Guatemalan capital and near the border with Mexico, so far causing the
deaths of 5 children, Mario Gudiel, a Ministry of Health representative
announced this Thursday. "It is a virus that we believe causes an
encephalitis or viral meningitis, put as yet we do not know with certainty
what it is, nor how it is transmitted" said Gudiel, the director of the
Integrated Health Care System.
Gudiel also stated that there are decrees from the Minister, Marco Tulio
Sosa, to implement various health cordons around the community of San
Andres Huista, Huehuetenango, some 360 km to the west of the capital, in
order to prevent the virus, which appeared on 16 Jun [2005], from spreading
to other areas.
"Thanks to these preventive cordons which we are beginning to put in place,
we discovered 2 children with symptoms similar to those of the 5 who died,
but their symptoms have been controlled," he added.
Gudiel explained that the virus kills those infected within 48 hours, and
it has been established that those who died presented with high fevers,
rigidity in the neck [nuchal rigidity], headaches and convulsions.
"This is the 1st time that cases of this [illness] have presented in the
country, and we want to know what we are confronting in order to eradicate
it." For this reason, specimens were sent outside of the country, he added.
Gudiel indicated that pediatricians, epidemiologists and infectious disease
specialists from the Ministry of Health and the Pan American Health
Organization are working in the area.

[More information on this cluster of apparent encephalitis-related deaths
would be appreciated. Possible "suspects" are viral encephalitides,
including several that affect equines (Venezuelan equine encephalitis -
VEE, eastern equine encephalitis - EEE, and western equine encephalitis -
WEE), West Nile virus (WNV), and St Louis encephalitis (SLE).
Rabies-associated encephalitis is always a possibility in the region,
although the rapid onset and progression argue against it -- as does its
absence from the differential diagnosis presented above, in an area where
rabies is not unseen. Similarly one might consider the possibility of
cerebral malaria.
Checking the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) website, one finds
no recent reports of equine encephalitis outbreaks in the region. The most
recent report of VEE in the region is in Belize in Feb 2005, and of WNV in
Belize in Mar 2004 and in Cuba in Feb 2005.

Given the close proximity of Huehuetenango to the Mexican border state of
Chiapas, one wonders whether a similar cluster of encephalitic-like
illnesses/deaths have occurred in Mexico as well. - Mod.MPP]
