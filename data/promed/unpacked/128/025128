In a follow-up to a report last week, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has reported an additional 3 leptospirosis fatalities in Mumbai, bringing the total to 15 in just 10 days.

At present, 30 people are being treated for the disease in BMC-run hospitals. To prevent leptospirosis, the corporation has started an awareness campaign in which they have visited 14 649 houses and surveyed 57 736 people, according to an Indian media report.

The fatalities have been reported primarily in the suburbs between Malad and Dahisar. Municipal health officials said it was difficult to explain why the deaths were concentrated in this area. "The only explanation one can think of is the unavailability of qualified doctors in some localities, which has led to delayed treatment. Ideally, if the patient is started on the antibiotic doxycyline, the disease is completely curable," said a senior civic official. Also, the rat and dog population in these areas could be high; their urine and fecal matter carry the infection and are responsible for transmission.

Leptospirosis is a bacterial zoonotic disease caused by the corkscrew-shaped organism, _Leptospira_. It [leptospirosis] goes by several other names depending on the locale; mud fever, swamp fever, sugar cane and Fort Bragg fever, among others. It is a disease of both humans and animals.

The rat is the main host to _Leptospira_. However, other animals, such as cattle, pigs, horses, dogs, rodents, and wild animals, can carry the disease.

People become infected by direct or indirect contact with the urine of these animals. Contact with urine-contaminated water is [an important risk factor]. Contaminated food and soil containing animal urine are other potential sources of infection.

The bacterium enters through contact with skin, especially through cuts or breaks in the skin, and through mucous membranes like the eyes.

Found worldwide, it was long considered an occupational disease (miners, farmers, vets, and sugarcane harvesting and sewer workers); it is increasingly associated with recreational water sports and camping.

Symptoms of leptospirosis, if present, appear in up to 4 weeks after exposure. Sometimes the person will show no symptoms or mild flu-like symptoms. According to the CDC, leptospirosis may occur in 2 phases; after the 1st phase, with fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, vomiting, or diarrhea, the patient may recover for a time but become ill again. If a 2nd phase occurs, it is more severe; the person may have kidney or liver failure (jaundice), or meningitis. This phase is also called Weil's disease. Leptospirosis is confirmed by laboratory testing of a blood or urine sample.

The infection can be treated with antibiotics (penicillin and doxycycline), especially if started early in the disease. For very ill patients, intensive care support and IV antibiotics may be necessary.

[The news report above is an update on the leptospirosis outbreak in Mumbai (ProMED-mail post Leptospirosis - India: (MH) fatal, flooding 20150706.3489806). The number of deaths has risen from 2 to 15, with 30 additional hospitalized patients.

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that occurs worldwide, and outbreaks frequently follow flooding after heavy rainfall and subsequent exposure of humans to floodwater contaminated by the urine of rats (and dogs) whose kidneys are chronically infected with _Leptospira_. Mumbai is subject to heavy rainfall during the monsoon season (June-September). July is the wettest month, with almost non-stop rain. At this time, parts of the city become waterlogged (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Mumbai) or flooded under several feet of water, as has been reported on 6 Jul 2015 in Mumbai (http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/Rain-lashes-city-water-logging-hits-city-traffic/articleshow/47964435.cms).

Mumbai, formerly known as Bombay, is a port city on the western coast of India and is its richest and most populous city, with a total metropolitan area population of about 20.5 million (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai). It is the capital of the Indian state of Maharashtra. - Mod.ML
