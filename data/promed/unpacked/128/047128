[Talas oblast is situated in north-west Kyrgyzstan, bordering
Kazakhstan. It is 300-350 km distant from the south-western Batken
oblast, where outbreaks of FMD have been recently observed, as
reported in yesterday's [3 May 2007 ]posting archived as
20070503.1442. The Kyrghiz Jalal-Abad oblast and territories of
Uzbekistan and Tajikistan separate the 2 regions. See map at:
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/kyrgyzstan_pol_05.pdf>.
The unavailability of first-hand, authoritative information and the
continued absence of official notifications with epidemiological
details from Kyrghyzstan, in spite of what seems to be a wide-spread
epizootic, should bother all Central-Asian countries and is a cause
for concern for the international animal-health agencies. - Mod.AS].
