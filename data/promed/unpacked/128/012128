_Salmonella_ outbreak linked to wild songbirds
----------------------------------------------
CDC and public health officials in several states are collecting different types of data to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium infections in people. Epidemiologic and laboratory data show that contact with wild songbirds and bird feeders is likely making people sick in this outbreak.

Epidemiologic data
------------------
As of 30 Mar 2021, a total of 19 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium have been reported from 8 states. Illnesses started on dates ranging from 26 Dec 2020 to 16 Mar 2021. The timeline of the cases can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/typhimurium-04-21/epi.html.

Location / number of sick people
--------------------------------
California / 3
Kentucky / 1
Mississippi / 1
New Hampshire / 1
Oklahoma / 1
Oregon / 5
Tennessee / 1
Washington / 6
-----------------
Total / 19

Sick people range in age from 2 months to 89 years, with a median age of 16 years, and 63% are female. Of 17 people with information available, 8 have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Wild songbirds, such as pine siskins, can be found throughout the USA, so this outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. The true number of sick people in an outbreak is likely much higher than the number reported because many people recover without medical care and are not tested for _Salmonella_. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it usually takes 2 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

State and local public health officials are interviewing people about the animals they had contact with in the week before they got sick. Of the 13 people interviewed, 9 (69%) reported owning a bird feeder and 2 (15%) people reported contact with a sick or dead wild bird. 10 people have pets that had access to or contact with wild birds.

Laboratory data
---------------
Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. CDC PulseNet manages a national database of DNA fingerprints of bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses. DNA fingerprinting is performed on bacteria using a method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). WGS showed that bacteria from sick people's samples are closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak likely got sick from contact with the same source.

Officials in Oregon and Washington collected samples from sick or dead wild pine siskin birds. WGS analysis showed that the _Salmonella_ from the pine siskins are closely related to bacteria from sick people.

WGS of bacteria isolated from 14 people's samples and 3 animal samples did not predict any antimicrobial resistance. Standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory is currently underway.

Public health actions
---------------------
On [1 Apr 2021], CDC issued an investigation notice about this outbreak to remind people to not touch or hand-feed wild birds with bare hands and always wash hands after touching wild birds, bird feeders, and bird baths. Clean and disinfect bird feeders and bird baths weekly or when they are visibly dirty. If you find a sick bird, call your state wildlife agency or wildlife rehabilitator. If you find a dead bird, check with your state wildlife agency for information about reporting dead birds in your area.

[There have been recent reports of salmonellosis in songbirds as noted in the Smithsonian Magazine (https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/songbirds-are-spreading-deadly-disease-birdfeeders-180977222/): "_Salmonella_ outbreaks tend to happen every winter as birds huddle on bird feeders, one of the most reliable sources of food, writes Portland Audubon's Wildlife Care Center Manager Stephanie Herman in a blog. But this year [2021] has seen such an overwhelming number of pine siskins, feeders and birdbaths are especially crowded. This year's extra-large migration, called an irruption, is notable even among similar events because the birds migrated at night, Andrew Del-Colle wrote for Audubon in October [2020]."

With this outbreak in birds, it is not a surprise that spillover into humans has occurred in those with direct or indirect contact with the birds. Pine siskins seem to be in the middle of the outbreak. Photos of the bird can be found at https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Pine_Siskin/media-browser/306420291. The calls of the bird can be heard at https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Pine_Siskin/sounds. - Mod.LL
