Measles cases surge in UK years after flawed vaccine research
-------------------------------------------------------------
More than a decade ago, British parents refused to give measles shots to at least a million children because of now discredited research that linked the vaccine to autism. Now, health officials are scrambling to catch up and stop a growing epidemic of the contagious disease. This year, the UK has had more than 1200 cases of measles, after a record number of nearly 2000 cases last year. The country once recorded only several dozen cases every year. It now ranks second in Europe, behind only Romania.

Last month, emergency vaccination clinics were held every weekend in Wales, the epicenter of the outbreak. Immunization drives have also started elsewhere in the country, with officials aiming to reach 1 million children aged 10 to 16. Britain's top medical board stripped Wakefield of the right to practice medicine in the UK, ruling that he and 2 of his colleagues showed a "callous disregard" for the children in the study, subjecting them to unnecessary, invasive tests. As part of his research, Wakefield took blood samples from children at his son's birthday party, paying them about 5 pounds each ($7.60), and later joked about the incident.

Still, MMR immunization rates plummeted across the UK as fearful parents abandoned the vaccine -- from rates over 90 percent to 54 percent. Nearly 15 years later, the rumors about MMR are still having an impact. Now there's "this group of older children who have never been immunized who are a large pool of infections," Elliman said. The majority of those getting sick in the UK -- including a significant number of older children and teens - had never been vaccinated. Almost 20 of the more than 100 seriously ill children have been hospitalized and 15 have suffered complications including pneumonia and meningitis. One adult with measles has died, though it's unclear if it was the disease that killed him.

The 1st measles vaccines were introduced in the 1960s, which dramatically cut cases of the rash-causing illness. Since 2001, measles deaths have dropped by about 70 percent worldwide; Cambodia recently marked more than a year without a single case. Globally, though, measles is still one of the leading causes of death in children under 5 and kills more than 150 000 people every year, mostly in developing countries. Measles is highly contagious and is spread by coughing, sneezing and close personal contact with infected people; symptoms include a fever, cough, and a rash on the face.

Across the UK, about 90 percent of children under 5 are vaccinated against measles and have received the necessary 2 doses of the vaccine. But among children now aged 10 to 16, the vaccination rate is slightly below 50 percent in some regions. To stop measles outbreaks, more than 95 percent of children need to be fully immunized. In some parts of the U.K., the rate is still below 80 percent. Unlike in the United States, where most states require children to be vaccinated against measles before starting school, no such regulations exist in Britain. Parents are advised to have their children immunized, but Britain's Department of Health said it had no plans to consider introducing mandatory vaccination.

Last year, there were 55 reported cases of measles in the United States, where the measles vaccination rate is above 90 percent. So far this year, there have been 22 cases, including 3 that were traced to Britain. In previous years, the UK has sometimes exported more cases of measles to the USA than some countries in Africa.

Portia Ncube, a health worker at an East London clinic, said the struggle to convince parents to get the MMR shot is being helped by the measles epidemic in Wales. "They see what's happening in Wales, so some of them are now sensible enough to come in and get their children vaccinated," she said.

Parents urged to take advantage of school MMR clinics as measles cases rise again
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Public Health Wales has urged parents to attend school clinics before theycome to an end this week, with an extra 20 cases of measles confirmed in the last 5 days. MMR vaccination clinics in schools will come to an end this week.

Public Health Wales said an extra 20 cases had been confirmed in the ABMU, Hywel Dda and Powys health board areas in the past 5 days, taking the total in the Swansea epidemic to 1125. Throughout Wales there have now been 1325 cases since the start of November 2012 - compared with just 19 in 2011 [a 70-fold increase].

Vaccination sessions have been taking place in schools across the country, but are set to come to an end this week. Officials said there was a particular urgency for parents with children aged between 10-18 to make use of the sessions. Efforts to offer MMR vaccination throughout Wales have seen more than 50 000 people being vaccinated in the last 2 months. But fewer than a third of these were given to people aged between 10 and 18 -- the age group hardest hit by the outbreak.

Dr Marion Lyons, director of health protection for Public Health Wales, said: "This is the final week that children in schools across Wales will be offered the MMR vaccination, so parents whose children have not yet been fully vaccinated with 2 doses of MMR are reminded to complete the consent form to ensure the vaccine can be given. "Children over the age of 16 can consent to the vaccination without needing their parents to sign the form." The MMR is also available through GP surgeries, and more than 3500 doses of MMR have been given in Welsh GP surgeries in the last 7 days, which is a great sign that people are still coming forward for the vaccination.

"But those who would prefer to attend a school session rather than make a GP appointment are reminded that this is the last week they will be taking place, so now is the time to act." Meanwhile, drop-in vaccination sessions are also being held in the Powys on Saturday, 25 May 2013.

Measles outbreak in Longnan city
--------------------------------
Since late March this year [2013], Wudu District reported abnormal increase in reported cases of measles, the incidence was significantly higher than last year [2012]. The Chinese Center for Disease Control, the provincial health department investigation team conducted a field survey and found Longnan measles prevention and control work in the existence of class measles vaccination is not solid, does not take the initiative to deal with the epidemic and other serious problems. 22 May 2013, Gansu Provincial Health Department has conducted some criticism.

According to "China Disease Prevention and Control Information System" report,
1 Jan.-11 May 2013 report current address for the JCP Wudu District, 111 cases of suspected cases of measles, including laboratory diagnosis of 88 cases, an outbreak of measles; Longnan City People's Hospital and the Hospital of Wudu District, the largest number of reported cases, 2 hospitals reported cases accounted for Wudu Chief cases of 88.99%. The epidemic is mainly younger age children and adult-onset, in which case 0-2 years and 15 years of age accounted for 95.41% of the total cases. The investigation team field for measles vaccination rate class rapid assessment results show:

1. Measles Vaccine 2 surveys vaccination immunization rate was 47.83%.
2.March 2013 supplementary immunization survey vaccination rate 79.07%.

3 surveyed villages exist in card, cards, inconsistent registered on the phenomenon.

Investigation Group agreed that the main reason for the outbreak of the epidemic are:
1- basic immunization of measles vaccine working class is weak. Survey measles vaccine 2 times vaccination class rate, not a solid basis for immunization, management is not standardized, there is population immunity gaps, increasing the spread of measles in the crowd danger. Health administrative departments at all levels for measles prevention and control work seriously enough, poor supervision work, the lack of effective training of junior officers.

2- hospital infection control efforts ineffective. According to epidemiological analysis of the survey shows that the spread of measles Wudu District, one of the main cross-infection control in hospitals is missing, cases of mismanagement, the emergence of the epidemic in the early failed to take timely and effective prevention and control measures to deal with Measles outbreaks spread triggered.

3- strong sense of infectious diseases. Suspected measles cases omission is serious, infectious disease management department medical institutions active search and did not carry out active surveillance of nosocomial, hospital clinicians suspected cases of measles reporting requirements for low awareness.

4- fever clinics and triage system implementation is not in place. Medical institutions did not conduct triage fever cases, suspected cases of measles have not implemented the 1st diagnosis responsibility system for the treatment of suspected cases did not take timely and appropriate quarantine disposal, sampling and basic information on the registration, resulting in cases of lost, increasing the the risk of epidemic spread.

Gansu Provincial Health Department instructed the Municipal Health Bureau, according to the "major mistake in Gansu Province vaccination accountability measures (Trial)" and "accountability, Gansu Province Hospital Infection Management Measures (Trial)" on the responsible units and persons responsible for accountability and Responsibility will handle the situation on 15 June [2013] in writing of the provincial health department.

Measles Outbreak Continues To Grow
----------------------------------
The measles outbreak in Borough Park is getting worse. Last week we reported that the outbreak has already infected 21 people in Borough Park this year and one in Williamsburg. Now Failed Messiah is reporting on a recent Department of Health alert that says that 34 cases have now been reported as more children and adults have been exposed to people who are infected.

Here is a copy of the DOH letter updating the latest outbreaks and instructions to doctors treating patients.
<DOHMH.Alert@dccnotify.com>.

Update on Measles in New York City

1) 34 cases of measles have occurred in Borough Park and Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Additional cases will likely occur, because a large number of children and adults have been exposed to infectious cases.
2) Providers are reminded to consider the diagnosis of measles in clinically compatible cases, immediately report and isolate suspect cases, and vaccinate children and adults.
3) Children need to receive their 1st dose of MMR vaccine at 12 months of age. Older unvaccinated children should be immunized immediately.

The measles outbreak in Brooklyn is continuing to grow. To date, there have been 34 confirmed cases, including 27 in Borough Park and 7 in Williamsburg. Additional suspected cases are being investigated. All cases are part of the Orthodox Jewish community and were unvaccinated at the time of exposure, including 5 cases too young to have been vaccinated, 23 cases who refused vaccine, and 6 cases whose vaccines were delayed. Cases range in age from 0-32 years (median 7 years), including 5 infants, 21 children, and 8 adults. Complications have included pneumonia, a miscarriage, and two hospitalizations. Measles is highly contagious. We have identified over 700 people who have been exposed, predominantly in health-care settings. Home isolation is required for up to 21 days for exposed persons without evidence of immunity to prevent further exposures. To interrupt the spread of measles in your community, we ask for your assistance regarding reporting, isolation, prophylaxis, testing and vaccination.

Mining town faces measles outbreak
----------------------------------
Queensland Health has declared a local measles outbreak in the Central Highlands' mining town of Moranbah. Dr Stephen Donohue says a nurse at the Moranbah Medical Centre caught the virus from a mine worker who contracted the illness while overseas. Queensland Health says it is worried more cases will emerge in the coming weeks. Dr Donohue says it is urgently trying to contact anyone who was at the medical centre between 14-16 May [2013]. "If it's a health care worker who's infectious, then the patients that they saw, if not already immune, may be vulnerable to the disease, absolutely," he said. "Measles is one of the most infectious diseases that's known and it will seek out people who are not immune to this disease. "Residents are being urged to ensure they have had both measles vaccinations. "If you get MMR [measles, mumps and rubella] vaccine to immunise yourself against measles, about 10 per cent of the time it doesn't work and so the second dose is an insurance policy to bring your probability of protection up to 99 per cent or more," Dr Donohue said. "If you were born since 1966 then you need to have 2 recorded doses. If you're not sure, then you should have another dose."
