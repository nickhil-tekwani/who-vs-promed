A prominent preparatory school in St Andrew has suspended classes
because of the detection of a student with hand, foot and mouth
disease (HFMD). The doors of the school will remain closed today [9
Oct 2009] following a premature ending of classes yesterday in an
effort to control the viral disease. It is reported that more than a
week ago, a kindergarten student at the school was confirmed with the
illness, prompting the institution to consider precautionary measures
to keep the students safe.

HFMD is a human syndrome caused by intestinal viruses. It usually
affects infants and children and is contagious. According to the
Ministry of Health, the disease is not serious as the illness is
typically mild.

Though the school claimed that only one student was diagnosed with
the disease, the health ministry told The Gleaner that 2 cases were
found. Other reports suggest that even more students might be affected.

The chairman of the school's board said the decision to close the
institution was taken to allow time for a general clean-up and
sanitising exercise. "Under the guidance of the Ministry of Health,
we have been advised that it is best to approach the issue in this
manner to minimise, to the extent that we reasonably can, the
possibility of our children spreading the infectious disease," he
said. He said the parents are being encouraged to take precautionary
measures at home while the school continues to do its part. "We teach
the children good hygienic practices here, but we try to get the
parents involved in an effort to control the disease."

HFMD can be spread through direct contact with the mucus, saliva or
faeces of an infected person. HFMD is not to be confused with
foot-and-mouth disease, which affects sheep, cattle and swine.

[Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common viral illness of
infants and children. The disease causes fever and blister-like
eruptions in the mouth and/or a skin rash. Illness usually begins
with a fever, poor appetite, discomfort, and often with a sore
throat. One or 2 days after fever onset, painful sores usually
develop in the mouth. They begin as small red spots that blister and
then often become ulcers. The sores are usually located on the
tongue, gums, and inside of the cheeks. A non-itchy skin rash
develops over 1-2 days. The rash has flat or raised red spots,
sometimes with blisters. The rash is usually located on the palms of
the hands and soles of the feet; it may also appear on the buttocks
and/or genitalia.

HFMD can be caused by a number of entroviruses. Coxsackievirus A16 is
the most common cause of HFMD, but enterovirus 71 is currently
causing widespread outbreaks of HFMD in Southeast Asia (see
ProMED-mail references below).

HFMD occurs mainly in children under 10 years old but can also occur
in adults. Children are more likely to be at risk for infection and
illness because they are less likely than adults to have antibodies
to protect them.
