RABIES, HUMAN, CONTROL - INDIA (TAMIL NADU)

Yesterday, Mon 20 Apr 2009, the 1st State Level Co-ordination Committee
Exclusively for the Control and Prevention of Rabies was held in Chennai
[formerly Madras]. The committee was formed under government order (MS)
Number 10 dated 06 Jan 2009 of the Health and Family Welfare (P1)
Department following a meeting held under the chairmanship of the chief
secretary of Tamil Nadu on 20 Nov 2008.

Yesterday's meeting was held with the director of municipal administration,
Dr P Senthil Kumar, IAS, as chairman, and was attended by the directors of
public health and preventive medicine; town panchayats; rural development
and local administration; medical education; medical and rural health
services; animal husbandry; and secretary of the Animal Welfare Board and
the undersigned.

Several most interesting facts emerged during the meeting:

1) Tamil Nadu has become the 1st state in India which has asked all local
bodies to set up animal birth control anti-rabies (ABC-AR) programmes.
2) All government hospitals in the state now administer the anti-rabies
vaccine by the intradermal route, saving over 80 per cent in vaccine costs.
3) Within a few months, all public health centres (PHC) will also follow suit.
4) The Department of Municipal Administration made a detailed presentation
on all the steps taken by it to ensure proper implementation of the ABC
programme.
5) Most importantly, there has been a steady and steep decline in rabies
cases over the last few years in Tamil Nadu as can be seen from the figures
below:

Year / Number of rabies deaths as reported by all PHCs in Tamil Nadu
2004 / 39
2005 / 43
2006 / 51
2007 / 8
2008 / 7
2009 / 0 (till 31 Mar 2009)

The above does not contain any information regarding rabies in urban areas.
With proper awareness and an aggressive ABC/AR programme, Tamil Nadu will
probably be the 1st state to become rabies free.

(While the Andaman and Nicobar Islands have never reported any cases of
rabies, the unrestricted and unorganised import of unvaccinated dogs from
the mainland is a time bomb likely to explode at any moment as happened in
Bali [Indonesia] recently. Nothing is being done in spite of warnings).

It may be mentioned here that when the undersigned was in the CPCSEA, one
of the major thrust areas was the intra-dermal vaccination for rabies and
we are delighted that it has been implemented, even though it has taken 4
years after Mr. Syed Munir Hoda as Secretary for Health and Family Welfare
stopped the use of the outmoded and dangerous neural tissue vaccine and
replaced it with tissue culture vaccine.

If all states in India followed Tamil Nadu's lead, human deaths from rabies
could plummet and we would well and truly be on our way to a rabies-free
country.

[The success achieved already in the control of rabies in Tamil Nadu is
impressive and the result of efficient and systematic medical responses.
However, rabies is a zoonotic disease and Taml Nadu cannot become
rabies-free until rabies in wildlife and domestic animals is eradicated.
