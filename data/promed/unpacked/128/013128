Italy: Outbreak of Enteroviral Meningitis in a Group of Travellers to
West Bengal, India
--------------------------------------------------
A group of 17 Italian scouts, aged 17 to 31, went hiking in West
Bengal, India (Calcutta, Nadia and Murshidabad Districts) from 19 Aug
2006 to 1 Sep 2006. One to 5 days after returning to Italy, 7 of them
presented to our hospital with fever, headache and neck stiffness.
CSF examination showed pleiocytosis in all patients ranging from 10
to 1300/cells/mmc (lymphocytes in 6/7, prevalence of neutrophils in
the patients with 1300 cells/mmc).
An enterovirus was detected in CSF by PCR in 5/7 patients. Virus
cultures are in progress on CSF, rectal and pharyngeal swabs. Serum
samples have been collected for antibody detection.

[ProMED-mail thanks Drs Caramello and Calleri for highlighting this
risk for visitors to West Bengal. Further information on the precise
identity of the enterovirus(es) responsible for this outbreak of
meningitis would be appreciated, whenever available. Enterovirus
infections are common where there are deficiencies in public water
supply and sewage disposal. Certain enteroviruses such as human
echovirus 6 and human echovirus 9 are more often associated with
meningitis. Fortunately viral meningitis usually resolves without
long-term disability.
