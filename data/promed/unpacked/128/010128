China rocked by food health scare
---------------------------------
Thousands of dairy cattle have been slaughtered on farms on the
outskirts of Beijing in a new foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] scare in
China, the South China Morning Post has reported.
The Hong Kong paper said on Monday [23 May 2005] the cows were culled
and farms cordoned in Yanqing district, a major dairy production
base, but Chinese media had been told not to report the outbreak of
the highly contagious stock disease.
"2000 cows have been buried already in 2 villages alone," an
unidentified Qianlizhuang villager told the paper. "The disease is
spreading quickly and so many cows have died. The entire area has
been sealed off for 2 weeks already and nobody from outside can get
inside."
Chinese officials rejected the report, which comes amid an outbreak
in migratory birds of the deadly H5N1 bird flu strain that has put
China on high alert.
China has kept FMD outbreaks hidden in the past but this month
reported the disease in cattle in the northern and eastern provinces
of Shandong and Jiangsu.
Officials in the Chinese animal feed industry said last week,
however, that Beijing had failed to report the extent of the wasting
disease. They said it had spread in pigs to about 10 Chinese
provinces since February 2005.
While FMD does not affect humans, it can have serious economic impact
on the livestock industry.

[The striking, typical feature of FMD is its rapid and massive spread
in susceptible animal populations; significant mortality may be seen
in young animals, sometimes 50 percent or even higher. However, in
adult animals, though clinical symptoms and reduced productivity may
be severe and consequent economic losses devastating, mortality will
usually not exceed 2-10 percent of the affected animals.
China sent to the OIE its 1st "Immediate notification report" on the
FMD outbreak, caused by FMDV serotype Asia 1, on 13 May 2005.
Official, laboratory-supported, timely follow-up reports will be
useful in replacing anecdotal information and support reliable media
coverage.- Mod.AS]
