[Also contained in this week's OIE Disease Information was the same
information from China that ProMED-mail posted in Avian influenza - Eastern
Asia (53) 20040320.0776. While commenting on the value of transparency
exhibited by that report, ProMED-mail also reviews the requirements for
being declared disease free from HPAI. It will take at least 6 months
after the disease has died down and stopped producing new cases.
As indicated above, the occurrence of new outbreaks has not
ended. Surveillance of appropriate population for 6 months is required,
and the surveillance must come after the cessation of new outbreak
cases. In both Thailand and South Korea, we are not there yet because of
outbreaks like the ones reported above. It will obviously be some time yet,
even if we have begun to turn the corner on this disease in Asia. - Mod.PC]
