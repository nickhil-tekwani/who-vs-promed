Omani citrus has faced various challenges over the past decades, of which the most important was witches' broom disease that killed nearly a million lime trees [ProMED-mail post 20141221.3047303].

Dr Abdullah Mohammed al Sadi, Sultan Qaboos University, said that the research team noticed symptoms on limes in some areas of the country. "The symptoms are yellow veins, blotchy mottled patterns on leaves, small green fruits, lopsided fruits, half green fruits, yellow shoots, twig dieback, and tree decline. Examination proved infection by _Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus."

[He] added, "It is important to do more surveys to investigate distribution of the disease in the country. If the disease is not widespread in the Sultanate, it may be necessary to eradicate the infected trees."

[Greening is one of the most damaging diseases of citrus crops affecting leaves and fruit. It is caused by fastidious phloem-inhabiting bacteria classified as _Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus (CaLas; Asian greening; huanglongbing), africanus (including a subsp. capensis; African greening) or americanus (South American greening). The 3 pathogens can only be distinguished by molecular methods.

Symptoms include blotchy mottling and yellowing of leaves, as well as small, irregularly shaped fruits with a thick, pale peel and bad taste. Early symptoms may be confused with nutrient deficiencies. Affected trees become stunted, bear multiple off-season flowers and may live for only a few years without ever bearing usable fruit. The diseases are restricted to _Citrus_ and close relatives because of the narrow host range of their psyllid vectors. The pathogens can also be spread by grafting and possibly by seed from infected plants or transovarially in the vectors. Both, pathogens and vectors, can be spread with plant material.

Disease management requires an integrated approach including use of clean planting and grafting stock, elimination of inoculum, use of pesticides for vector control in orchards, and chemical or biological control of vectors in non-crop reservoirs. Control using cultural methods, such as interplanting with non-host crops, is being trialled. In areas where a pathogen has not yet been detected, biological control of vectors has been used successfully to reduce insect numbers and, therefore, the risk of greening outbreaks (for example, see ProMED-mail post 20090601.2034).

Several phytoplasma species have been reported to cause similar symptoms in citrus and coinfections of phytoplasmas with CaLas have also been reported. A new serious citrus decline disease in Iran (ProMED-mail post 20180214.5629251) was shown to be due to coinfection of the lime witches' broom phytoplasma (_Ca._ Phytoplasma aurantifolia, 16SrII group) and CaLas. According to the report above, now both of these pathogens have also been detected in Oman. In addition, _Citrus tristeza virus_ and _Citrus exocortis Yucatan viroid_ (for more information on these pathogens see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives) have also been found in association with sudden decline of lime in the country (see link below). Further research is needed to determine epidemiology and host impact of these various mixed infections.
