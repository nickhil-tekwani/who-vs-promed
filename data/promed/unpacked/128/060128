A team of veterinary department officials from the Turkish Cypriot administration have killed 8 animals which were infected with lumpy skin disease [LSD].

Disinfection of the farm at the centre of the outbreak in the [Turkish controlled, North Cyprus] village of Genagra [see comment 1] continues. Meanwhile, a 3-km quarantine area has been established near the area where the disease 1st appeared.

LSD is caused by a virus of the family Poxviridae, also known as Neethling virus. It mainly affects cattle and zebus, but has also been seen in giraffes, African buffalo, and impalas. LSD was 1st seen as an epidemic in Zambia in 1929 and since then has affected cattle throughout Africa, including the countries of South Africa, Egypt, and Sudan, and in 1989, an outbreak was confirmed in Israel [see comment 2].

[1. The village of Genagra (in Greek, the Turkish name is Nergizli) is in the Famagusta district of Cyprus, 5 km southwest of Lefkoniko, just south of Lefkoniko Airport. This focus can be regarded as a southwestern extension of the affected area in Northern Cyprus. The 1st outbreaks were confined to the Karpas region, a long, finger-like peninsula in northeast Cyprus, about 70 km from continental Turkey.

2. Since January 2012, LSD has been officially reported by Azerbaijan, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Palestinian Autonomous Territories, and Turkey. Though no report from Syria has become available, the disease is assumed to widely circulate there as well.

Cyprus Veterinary Services are ready to help the Turkish Cypriots deal with the outbreak of lumpy skin disease (LSD) in cattle.

Minister of Agriculture, Natural Resources and the Environment [of the Republic of Cyprus] Nicos Kouyialis invited Turkish Cypriots to address their request for help to the authorities of the Republic.

He also referred to the high standards the Veterinary Services maintain and their expertise and experience in dealing with serious illnesses.

In December [2014], the Turkish Cypriot daily Kibris newspaper reported that 153 animals were slaughtered in occupied Karpasia because they contracted the contagious disease. According to the paper, the largest numbers of sick animals are in Agia Triada and in Yiallousa village.

EFSA Journal 2015;13(1):3986 [73 pp.]. doi:10.2903/j.efsa.2015.3986: Scientific Opinion on lumpy skin disease
-----------------------------------------------
Abstract:
Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a viral disease of cattle characterised by severe losses, especially in naive animals. LSD is endemic in many African and Asian countries, and it is rapidly spreading throughout the Middle East, including Turkey. LSD is transmitted by mechanical vectors, but direct/indirect transmission may occur. The disease would mainly be transferred to infection-free areas by transport of infected animals and vectors. In the EU, it could only happen through illegal transport of animals. The risk for that depends on the prevalence in the country of origin and the number of animals illegally moved.

Based on a model to simulate LSD spread between farms, culling animals with generalised clinical signs seems to be sufficient to contain 90 percent of epidemics around the initial site of incursion, but the remaining 10 percent of simulated epidemics can spread up to 400 km from the site of introduction by 6 months after incursion. Whole-herd culling of infected farms substantially reduces the spread of LSD virus, and the more rapidly farms are detected and culled, the greater the magnitude of the reduction.

Only live attenuated vaccines against LSD are available. Homologous vaccines are more effective than sheep pox strain vaccines. The safety of the vaccines should be improved, and the development of vaccines for differentiating between infected and vaccinated animals is recommended. Epidemics are not self-limiting when effective vaccination or culling are not applied. Active surveillance, rapid detection, and prompt culling of infected herds are effective measures for LSD control. The role of vectors for LSD transmission should be further investigated in both controlled environments and the field. Awareness-raising campaigns for farmers and veterinary staff to promote recognition of LSD should be considered. The cooperation of the EU with neighbouring countries should be encouraged to prevent transboundary disease spread.

[The summary of the scientific opinion on LSD, prepared by EFSA's Panel on Animal Health and Welfare (AHAW), is available at the above URL. The full document (73 pages) is available at http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/3986.pdf and is recommended for reading. In view of the dilemmas on vaccination currently prevailing in recently invaded areas (e.g. Azerbaijan, Iran, Northern Cyprus and Kuwait), subscribers are specifically referred to the opinion's articles 9.3 "vaccines," 9.4 "vaccination in endemic area," and 9.4.1. "Vaccination as control option in free areas" (pages 50-51).

The opinion's statement about homologous vaccines being "more effective than sheep pox strain vaccines" is plausible; it is partially based upon preliminary results of field trials in Israel with the 2 vaccines compared. These results are yet to be published and are anticipated with interest. It should be borne in mind that a certain percentage of the animals included in the trials had, reportedly, undergone previous vaccination(s), the recordings of which deserving consideration within their analysis.

OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Manual chapter "2.4.14. Lumpy skin disease" specifies the tests of the live attenuated capripox vaccines intended for the protection of cattle against LSD. For subscribers' convenience, we copy herewith some of OIE's requirements for authorisation of the final product, namely, "Efficacy requirements (for animal production):"

"The efficacy of the vaccine must be demonstrated in vaccination challenge experiments under laboratory conditions. Six cattle of known susceptibility to LSD are placed in a high containment level large animal unit. Five randomly chosen vials of the freeze-dried vaccine are reconstituted in sterile PBS and pooled. Four cattle are vaccinated with the recommended dose using the recommended route. The remaining 2 cattle are control animals. On day 21 after vaccination, the 6 animals are challenged with a known virulent capripoxvirus strain by intradermal inoculation. The clinical response is recorded during the following 14 days. Control animals should develop the typical clinical signs of LSD, whereas there should be no local or systemic reaction in the vaccinates other than a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, which should disappear after 4 days. Because of the variable response in cattle to LSD challenge, generalised disease may not be seen in the control animals, although there should be a large local reaction." The chapter is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.14_LSD.pdf.

Currently, both sheep-pox and Neethling-based, live attenuated vaccines are applied in the affected countries. In case LSD continues its spread, vaccination may become a necessity in highly susceptible animals in virgin areas as well. These countries -- as well as recently infected countries (e.g. Northern Cyprus, Kuwait) -- will benefit from updated and accurate information on the preferable vaccine to be applied. Controlled tests with currently available vaccines deserve serious consideration. - Mod.AS
