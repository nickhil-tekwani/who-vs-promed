Seroprevalence of Schmallenberg Virus Antibodies among Dairy Cattle, the Netherlands, Winter 2011-2012
-----------------------------------------------
Abstract
Infections with Schmallenberg virus (SBV) are associated with congenital malformations in ruminants. Because reporting of suspected cases only could underestimate the true rate of infection, we conducted a seroprevalence study in the Netherlands to detect past exposure to SBV among dairy cattle. A total of 1123 serum samples collected from cattle during November 2011-January 2012 were tested for antibodies against SBV by using a virus neutralization test; seroprevalence was 72.5 percent. Seroprevalence was significantly higher in the central-eastern part of the Netherlands than in the northern and southern regions (p under 0.001). In addition, high (70-100 percent) within-herd seroprevalence was observed in 2 SBV-infected dairy herds and 2 SBV-infected sheep herds. No significant differences were found in age-specific prevalence of antibodies against SBV, which is an indication that SBV is newly arrived in the country.

The finding that SBV is "newly arrived in the Netherlands" (and the other clinically affected countries in Europe) should not be a surprise. Orthobunyavirus-related outbreaks of arthrogryposis-hydranencephaly (AG/HE) in neonate ruminants, such as those caused by the Akabane virus, are absent in endemic regions since the population undergoes seroconversion prior to the reproductive age, foeti remaining protected from infection throughout their mothers' lives. AG/HE will appear in neighbouring regions when airborne infected vectors are introduced from the endemic region, causing outbreaks of congenital malformations in susceptible, virgin populations. It will be interesting to obtain results of SBV serological investigations from other parts of Europe. - Mod.AS]

Letter: Culicoids as Vectors of Schmallenberg Virus
-----------------------------------------------
We present evidence that culicoids captured in October 2011 in Denmark contained SBV RNA and most likely are vectors for this agent.

In autumn 2011, culicoids were collected from several sites within Denmark. One site, a chicken farm in Hokkerup [for map, refer to the original article at the source URL] was selected for study because of its location close (6 km) to the German border and proximity (less than 10 km) to an SBV-infected sheep farm in Germany, as reported on 9 Mar 2012 by the Friedrich Loeffler Institute surveillance website (http://www.fli.bund.de).

The culicoids were collected during 14-16 Oct 2011. Midges were sorted manually into 91 specimens of the _C. obsoletus_ group (comprising _C. obsoletus_, _C. chiopterus_, _C. dewulfi_, and _C. scoticus_) and 17 of the _C. punctatus sensu stricto_ group, then stored at -20 C.

Two of 22 pools tested strongly positive for the large (L) and small (S) segments of SBV RNA. Each positive sample was derived from 5 midges of the _C. obsoletus_ group. One pool produced cycle threshold (Ct) values of 26.4 and 24.5 (in the L segment- and S segment-specific assays, respectively), whereas the 2nd positive pool gave Ct values of 28.8 (L segment) and 27.6 (S segment).

These pools were negative for the internal endogenous control that targeted the bovine/ovine beta-actin mRNA. This result makes it unlikely that the detection of SBV RNA within the midges resulted from recent blood meals from infected animals remaining within the culicoids and suggests the virus has replicated within the midges.

Even if all 5 culicoids in a pool had recently taken a blood meal from a viremic animal, the Ct values observed here strongly suggest replication of SBV within the _C. obsoletus_ group midges. However, in principle, other hosts of SBV could have a much higher level of viremia than cattle and could provide the levels of SBV RNA detected. _C. punctatus_ s.s. midges cannot be ruled out as a possible vector of SBV because of the limited number of insects tested.

Our study demonstrates the presence of SBV RNA in _C. obsoletus_ group midges caught in Denmark during October 2011. The low Ct values (i.e., high SBV RNA levels) and the absence of ruminant beta-actin mRNA in these samples strongly suggest that SBV replicates in these midges and, hence, that the _C. obsoletus_ group midges are natural vectors for this virus.

[Results of entomological investigations related to SBV have, so far, come also from Belgium and Italy. Data from other countries will be welcomed. It may be anticipated that vector studies will be enhanced within the EU-planned research into SBV.

It may be assumed that SBV will be one of the subjects reviewed and discussed during this week's 80th General Session of the OIE in Paris. SBV is not (yet) included in OIE's list. So far, it has been reported by the affected member-countries as an "emerging disease." - Mod.AS
