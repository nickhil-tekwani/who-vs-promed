Authorities in the United Kingdom and Ireland are investigating a foodborne outbreak suspected to be caused by norovirus in live oysters.

The oysters are thought to have come from Ireland and been purified in the UK, and it is believed they are no longer on the market.

Harvesting records and purification operations at the unnamed implicated business in Ireland have been checked with nothing proving that oysters harvested at the time were contaminated.

A number of people fell ill in England, and the investigation has pointed towards a potential norovirus outbreak linked to one restaurant.

The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) told Food Safety News that it has sought detailed clarification on traceability and delivery channels.

"We have started investigations in relation to this notification from the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed. It is not yet certain if the oysters that were consumed by the people who became ill were actually from Ireland," said a spokeswoman.

Nevertheless, at the request of the FSAI, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) checked the harvesting records and purification operations at the implicated business in Ireland. There is nothing to demonstrate that any oysters harvested at that time were contaminated. There are also no other reports of illness. The FSAI and the SPFA are continuing inquiries."

High risk factors for shellfish-related norovirus include cold weather (low water temperatures), high prevalence of norovirus gastroenteritis in the community, and high rainfall (potentially leading to sewage system overflows). There is no regulatory limit for norovirus relating to shellfish.

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) advised consumers not to change their choice of eating out as a result of the outbreak.

"We are working with Public Health England to investigate why a number of people have reported digestive symptoms after eating out," a spokeswoman told Food Safety News. This is being investigated as a potential norovirus outbreak linked to one restaurant. We're working to determine the actual cause of the illnesses and which producer or supplier may be implicated."

Norovirus can contaminate food and water and can also spread through contact with the feces or vomit of an infected person. It causes an estimated 3 million cases of diarrhea and vomiting each year and is estimated to be the 3rd most common cause of foodborne illness in the UK.

Although symptoms can be unpleasant, it is considered a mild infection because it is usually short lived, and most people get better without medical treatment. Outbreaks have been caused by infected oysters and fresh produce such as berries and salad.

[Note that norovirus has not yet been confirmed in the UK and Ireland, but appears likely. Both norovirus and paralytic shellfish poisoning are associated with shellfish, however, norovirus is a highly infectious virus, and paralytic shellfish poisoning is caused by a biotoxin produced by algae.

Researchers analyzed the genetic sequences of 1077 samples of noroviruses found in oysters. Some sequences had been stockpiled in genetic databases since 1983. The scientists found that 80 percent of the known human noroviruses matched those found in oysters. The majority of the matches were in oysters from coastal waters, more likely to be contaminated with human sewage.

Noroviruses mutate very quickly, as do influenza viruses, and big outbreaks usually begin after a new strain emerges. There was a "convergence" between new strains circulating in oysters and those circulating in humans, the researchers also found.

Yongjie Wang, a food science specialist at Shanghai Ocean University and lead author of the study, concluded that oysters were an important reservoir for human noroviruses, a place where they can hide between outbreaks and mutate. They also can be transmitted back to humans, presumably when oysters are eaten raw.
