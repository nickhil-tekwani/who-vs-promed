Outbreak of a paralysis-causing toxin from shellfish in Sucre State
--------------------------------------------------
Due to an outbreak of paralysis-causing toxin from shellfish in Sucre
State, San Juan de las Galdonas parish, Playa de Cangua community, an alert
was declared on 9 Jun 2004, after the death on 6 Jun of an 8-year-old girl
who presented with "body numbness", loss of muscle strength in her arms and
in her neck, and inability to walk.
Her mother administered "traditional medicines", and since the girl did not
improve, she was brought to the San Juan de Macarapana day care health
center. From that facility she was referred to Rio Caribe hospital because
of her delicate condition, but she died while she was being transported to
the hospital. An important piece of information is that she ate guacucos
[bivalves, similar to clams but smaller], together with arepas [cornmeal
griddle cakes] and butter.
Suspecting the presence of a paralyzing toxin, samples from mussels and
"guacucos" were taken, considering that the symptoms were compatible with
those caused by the action of a paralyzing toxin. Of the group who ate
"guacucos" (12 persons), only the 8-year-old girl and 2 younger brothers, 5
and 2 years old, developed symptoms. However, the symptoms were mild in the
boys.
The INIA (a Venezuelan Government Institution for Research) sent back the
results of the studies performed in the samples obtained, reporting very
high paralyzing toxin concentrations: 557.01 micrograms per 100 grams in
mussels, and 866 micrograms per 100 grams in "guacucos". The Manager of
Sanitary Control was informed, and it was decided to prohibit the trade and
consumption of these species, to continuously monitor these products every
6 days, to analyze sea water for phytoplankton concentrations, and report
the results to the community (Playa de Cangua and Cangua) and the central
government (Regional Epidemiology Direction, Sucre State).

[Although the name of the toxin is not given, based upon the monitoring of
the sea water for phytoplankton, it seems logical that this could be
paralytic shell fish poisoning, and may be caused by one of the organisms
responsible for causing red tide. For reviews on paralytic shellfish
poisoning, please see the references below. - Mod.TG]
