Rabbit haemorrhagic disease in Uruguay
--------------------------------------
(disease never reported before in Uruguay)
This report is a translation of information received on 29 December 2004
(dated 28 Dec) from Dr Carlos A Correa Messuti, Ministry of Animal
Production, Agriculture and Fisheries, Montevideo:
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, epidemiological and postmortem.
Date of suspicion: 24 Nov 2004.
Outbreaks:
Location/No. of outbreaks
Montevideo city/ 40
Canelones department/ 4
San Jose department/ 1
Total 45
Description of affected population: backyard domestic rabbits.
Total number of animals in the outbreaks:
species / susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
lep / 4689 / 4689 / 2820 / 1869 / ...
Diagnosis: the following signs were observed: sudden death, depression,
some rabbits showed nervous signs and bleeding from the mouth and nostrils,
terminal scream.
A. The diagnosis was made at DILAVE( Veterinary Laboratories Division --
the official laboratory of the General Directorate of Livestock Services),
using postmortem examinations in situ and histopathological examination.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent/origin of infection: movements of animals, persons and feed.
B. Other epidemiological details: the disease occurred in the suburban
areas of the city of Montevideo and in adjacent areas in the Departments of
Canelones and San Jose.
Control measures:
- culling of sick rabbits;
- disinfection of premises and equipment;
- spraying of insecticide;
- control of rodents and birds;
- burning and burying of dead rabbits, feedstuff, skins and faeces;
- recommendations have been issued aimed at preventing gatherings of rabbit
producers and related persons;
- vaccination: arrangements are being made to import vaccine; vaccination
is due to be applied in at-risk areas and establishments where the disease
has not been registered but will not be applied in commercial rabbit farms
unless necessary;
- control of the movements of people, animals, and vehicles; ban on the
movement of rabbits to other establishments and slaughterhouses;
- exports of rabbits and by-products were immediately suspended.

Rabbit haemorrhagic disease In Uruguay
--------------------------------------
Follow-up from above report, from the OIE Reference Laboratory for rabbit
haemorrhagic disease(Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia
e dell'Emilia Romagna "Bruno Ubertini", Brescia, Italy), received on (and
dated) 10 January 2005 from Dr Carlos A Correa Messuti, Ministry of Animal
Production, Agriculture and Fisheries, Montevideo:
All 4 rabbit samples (liver and spleen) received were positive for rabbit
haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) when tested by the sandwich ELISA
(enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test specific for RHDV. A further
sandwich ELISA performed on the same 4 samples with a panel of 14
monoclonal antibodies specific for RHDV and its variant RHDVa confirmed the
presence of the RHDVa variant.
The RHDVa variant was first identified in Europe, in 1997. In Italy, it is
slowly replacing the original RHDV strain in the field. The rabbit
haemorrhagic disease virus identified in the United States of America in
2000 was also the RHDVa variant. Under experimental conditions, the vaccine
produced with the original RHDV strain protects rabbits exposed to RHDVa.
However, if we consider that the antigenic drift that led to RHDVa involves
an epitope that is important for protection from infection, it might be
better to use a vaccine produced using the RHDVa strain.

[Rabbit hemorrhagic disease was first recognized in China in the mid-1980s.
It occurs in Korea, is widespread in Australia and New Zealand, and has
been reported in most of Europe. The domestic rabbit and the European
rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) are susceptible, and it appears as though
other lagomorphs are not. The disease has a high mortality rate, so it is
of some consequence. Although not reported previously from South America,
Cuba and the United States have had significant outbreaks, and the disease
has been eradicated from Mexico since 1992. Both the United States and
Mexican outbreaks had some association with infected meat imported from
China, so I would like to know if Uruguay imports any rabbit meat from
China and, if so, whether there any association with this new outbreak.
For those interested in the history of intentional use of viral agents, the
postings on the New Zealand outbreak are very instructive. Briefly, a
farmer (not the government!) in New Zealand intentionally introduced the
virus as a biocontrol tool after great frustration with rabbit control
policies. - Mod.PC]
