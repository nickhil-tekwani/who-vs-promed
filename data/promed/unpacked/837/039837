Recent fatal human hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) cases, one each in
Colorado and New Mexico, plus a non-fatal HPS case in Arizona and a
non-fatal (at this time) HPS case in New Mexico has people in this part of
the world (southwestern USA) justifiably nervous. Ecologic conditions
vary from local to location, of course, but in general, recent observations
have been of increases in rodent populations and increased prevalence of
antibody to Sin Nombre virus, likely a result of two wet, relatively warm
El Nino/Southern Oscillation winters. The next month should allow
determinations as to whether conditions are suitable for a repeat of the
1993 situation, when HPS and Sin Nombre virus were first recognized.
Unfortunately, the only way to test the predictive model is to experience
another outbreak. After that, prediction should be easier.
