The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has detected an increase in drug-resistant _Shigella sonnei_ infections, mostly in men who have sex with men (MSM).

Currently, it has confirmed 208 cases in the European territory. According to the report published this week by the ECDC, the United Kingdom Health Security Agency reported an increase in these infections at the end of January [2022] [https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Shigella-infections-MSM-Feb-2022.pdf] [Also see ProMED-AMR post Shigellosis - UK: Shigella sonnei, multidrug resistant clone, MSM 20220131.8701181]. One month later [February 2022], this outbreak has spread to 10 countries.

As of 17 Feb 2022, the distribution of cases is as follows: 106 confirmed cases in France; 62 in the United Kingdom; 9 in Austria; 8 in Spain; 6 in Ireland and Norway, respectively; 4 in Belgium; 3 in Germany and Italy, respectively; and 1 in Denmark with sampling dates from 2020 to 2022 and with isolates either closely genetically related by whole genome sequencing (WGS), or with the same or a very similar resistance profile.

Most cases were in adult men who have sex with men (MSM). A large proportion of the patients with available information were reported to be infected through sexual transmission. The probability of new infections in MSM exposed to high-risk sexual practices, and the spread in EU/EEA countries in the coming months is assessed as high, as outbreaks among MSM usually occur over long time periods.

Increase in extensively-drug resistant _Shigella sonnei_ infections in men who have sex with men in the EU/EEA and the UK. 23 Feb 2022. https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Shigella-infections-MSM-Feb-2022.pdf

Summary
-------
"On 27 Jan 2022, the United Kingdom Health Security Agency (UKHSA) reported an increase in extensively- drug resistant _Shigella sonnei_ infections. Since then, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway, and Spain have reported cases of shigellosis with sampling dates from 2020 to 2022 and with isolates either closely genetically related by whole genome sequencing (WGS), or with the same or a very similar resistance profile. Most cases were in adult men who have sex with men (MSM). A large proportion of the patients with available information were reported to be infected through sexual transmission.

Risk assessment
---------------
"This document assesses the risk of further spread of _S. sonnei_ amongst MSM and in the broader population in EU/EEA countries, resulting from the current increase in extensively-drug resistant _S. sonnei_ infections.

"Sexual contact networks among some MSM in Europe are highly interconnected, sometimes involving high-risk sexual practices often involving anonymous sexual contacts. The probability of new infections in MSM exposed to high-risk sexual practices, and the spread in EU/EEA countries in the coming months is assessed as high, as outbreaks among MSM usually occur over long time periods. If the lifting of restrictions related to the COVID- 19 pandemic is also considered, travel and the number of social events will likely increase as well. The impact of such infections is assessed as low in most instances as _S. sonnei_ is generally associated with mild disease in healthy adults. However, the impact of the infection could be more severe in immunocompromised adults. In addition, the resistance profile of this strain limits treatment options, whether this is aimed at shortening shedding in mild cases or treating severe cases. Based on these levels of probability and impact, the level of risk for MSM is assessed as moderate.

"Opportunities for infection in the non-MSM population increase when transmission among MSM is high. Currently, there have been very few reports of non-MSM cases associated with the ongoing increase of cases of extensively-drug resistant _S. sonnei_. The probability of infections in the broader population, including the probability of foodborne outbreaks associated with infected food handlers, is assessed as very low. The impact of such infections is assessed as low in most instances, due to a generally mild disease in healthy individuals. Consequently, the level of risk for the broader population is assessed as low.

Options for response
--------------------
"Men who have sex with men should aim to minimise the risk of infection through faecal-oral exposure during sexual activity by practicing safe sex and good hygiene. MSM presenting symptoms of gastrointestinal illness are recommended to get tested for gastrointestinal pathogens and other STIs and to inform the treating physician about the infection risk through sexual activity. Sexual activity should be avoided for at least 7 days after symptoms have stopped and faecal-oral contact during sex should be avoided for 4 to 6 weeks. Awareness activities targeted at MSM, especially those identified to be at higher risk, e.g. MSM on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), should also be considered to increase knowledge about the ongoing threat of shigellosis.

"People with gastrointestinal symptoms should not handle and prepare food for catering or in private households until fully recovered or stool culture is negative for Shigella. In healthcare settings, in addition to standard precautions, contact precautions, including placement in a single room with a dedicated toilet, adequate access to hand hygiene and regular environmental cleaning, should be considered for suspected or confirmed extensively drug-resistant _S. sonnei_ cases.

"There are very limited options for treatment of extensively-drug resistant _S. sonnei_. Clinicians should be aware of increasing trends of antimicrobial resistance in _Shigella_ spp. and ensure susceptibility testing on all clinical isolates, especially from high-risk groups, from patients returning from international destinations, and from MSM, who are at risk of a resistant infection. When antimicrobial treatment is indicated, it should be based on the results of susceptibility testing. Non-specialist physicians should be aware that among young adult males, especially among those with no travel history, the route of acquisition can be sexual.

"Timely antimicrobial resistance profiles with sufficient epidemiological information will enable early detection and investigation of treatment failures and will inform national and international treatment guidelines. Reporting of outbreaks with extensively-drug resistant _S. sonnei_ and related treatment failures should be strengthened at the national and European level to enable rapid intervention and to prevent the spread of antimicrobial-resistant _S. sonnei_. Timely sharing of data on treatment failure among EU/EEA countries will facilitate a more effective response. The use of EpiPulse is encouraged to implement rapid information sharing at the European level. Any new information linked to this event can be reported in EpiPulse.

"ECDC encourages countries to perform whole genome sequencing (WGS) on _S. sonnei_ isolates linked to human infections, especially extensively drug-resistant ones. ECDC can provide WGS support for isolates possibly linked to multi-country events."

Of the 4 _Shigella_ species (_Shigella sonnei_, _Shigella flexneri_, _Shigella boydii_, and _Shigella dysenteriae_), _S. sonnei_ is the commonest species in the United States. Humans are the only reservoir for _Shigella_, which are easily transmitted person-to-person because _Shigella_ are relatively resistant to gastric acidity, and only a few (10 to 100) organisms if swallowed, will survive passage through the stomach and be sufficient to establish infection in the lower intestinal tract.

The organisms are spread via hands, mouth, food, or water that have come into contact with the stool of a person infected with _Shigella_. Humans are the only natural reservoir for the disease. Although shigellosis is usually self-limited in 5-7 days without antibiotic treatment, antibiotics are commonly used to decrease fecal excretion of the organism that may otherwise last up to several weeks and for severe cases that have prolonged dysentery or sepsis. However, resistance to antimicrobials has restricted treatment options.

In 2015 ProMED posted a report of an outbreak of multidrug-resistant (MDR) _Shigella sonnei_ in the USA, affecting more than 300 people that appeared to have been repeatedly imported by international travel in men who have sex with men (MSM) (ProMED post Shigellosis - USA (03): travel, MSM, antimicrobial resistance 20151021.3732921). In 2016 ProMED posted a report of a single clone, based on WGS, widespread in South Asia, that was likely driving an intercontinental surge of ciprofloxacin-resistant _S. sonnei_ (ProMED post Shigellosis, antimicrobial-resistant - South Asia: spread 20160904.4464085). Then, in 2019, ProMED reported an outbreak between March and November 2018 in the UK of 17 cases of shigellosis caused by an MDR _Shigella_ clone, based on whole genome sequencing (WGS), that clustered among MSM. A total of 9 further cases were identified in the USA (Shigellosis - UK: multiresistant, MSM 20190128.6279377 and https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/769163/SHGLL-SONN_2018275.pdf).

Resistance markers in this clone included blaCTX-M-27, which encodes an extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL), a single gyrA mutation associated with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and the macrolide resistance markers erm(B) and mph(A). Consequently, treatment of infections caused by this MDR strain with fluoroquinolones, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone is unlikely to be effective. TMP/SMX had been one of the drugs of choice for treatment of shigellosis, but emerging resistance to this antimicrobial drug limited its empiric use (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3462054/). - Mod.ML
