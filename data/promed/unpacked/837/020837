The Health Ministry said Wednesday [13 Feb 2013] that 2 more people have been confirmed dead due to a viral infection transmitted by a mite [tick?] bite, bringing the death toll in Japan to 3. Both were men, one living in Ehime Prefecture and the other in Miyazaki Prefecture. They died last fall [2012] from the infection, known as severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome [SFTS], the Ministry said. They had no recent record of overseas travel.

The Ministry confirmed in January [2013] that an adult woman in Yamaguchi Prefecture died last fall [2012] from the syndrome. It brushed aside concerns that the new viral infection has been spreading in Japan, saying the number of deaths only increased as local authorities re-examined overlooked cases.

No effective vaccine has been found to prevent the viral infection, which was 1st reported in China around 2009. Genetic studies showed the virus that killed the 3 Japanese occurred in Japan and did not come from China, the Ministry said.

[The above press report does not identify directly the virus responsible for these deaths in Japan, but it is likely to be the arbovirus responsible for the outbreak of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome [SFTS] in Shandong Province, China described by Li Zhao et al in Emerging Infectious Disease, Volume 18, Number 6, June 2012 (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/6/11-1345_article.htm).

Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a serious infectious disease with a 12 percent case-fatality rate that has been documented in 6 rural provinces in northeast and central China. SFTS is caused by a novel bunyavirus, severe fever with thromobocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) (1). The major clinical signs and symptoms of SFTS are fever, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated serum hepatic enzyme levels.

SFTSV is classified in the family _Bunyaviridae_, genus _Phlebovirus_, and is believed to be transmitted by ticks because the virus has been detected in _Haemaphysalis longicornis_ ticks (1). However, the disease can also be transmitted from person to person through contact with infected patients' blood or mucous (2,3). SFTSV seroprevalence in the human population is unknown, and the natural reservoir hosts of SFTSV have not been determined. The Chinese authors report results from a SFTSV serosurvey conducted on healthy persons and goats in Yiyuan County in Shandong Province, China, an area to which SFTS is endemic. The authors concluded that subclinical SFTSV infections or a relatively mild form of SFTS illness may occur in humans; however, more research is required.

It may be that the outbreak of SFTS in Japan has been caused by an entirely different virus. Clarification from the Japanese health authorities is awaited. - Mod.CP
