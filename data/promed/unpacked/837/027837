The Kerala Agricultural University (KAU) has launched a study into what appears to be a viral infection in pineapple plants in parts of Ernakulam district. Samples of affected plants are being tested to identify the problem. The infection had affected fruiting in about 15% of the plants, said a farmer.

The area has had intense rain recently which has also affected the production of pineapple fruits. It is estimated that there are around 18 000 hectares under pineapple cultivation in the state.

[A number of fungi, as well as some bacteria nematodes are known to affect pineapple. Up to now, only few viral pathogens of the crop have been identified, including 3 ampeloviruses associated with pineapple mealybug wilt, 2 badnaviruses, as well as the wide host range _Tomato spotted wilt virus_. In addition, some diseases of the crop of so far unknow etiology have also been suspected to be due to viruses.

There is no indication in the story above why a viral cause has been suspected, what symptoms other than failure of fruit production are being observed, or what diagnostic tests are being applied. Hence, the suggestion of a viral cause appears to be merely speculative. Nevertheless, investigating potential viral or other intracellular pathogens of the crop may contribute to the information available for designing management strategies for the crop.
