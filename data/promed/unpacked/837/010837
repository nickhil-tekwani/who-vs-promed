11 cases of measles have been confirmed in the Eastleigh area of Nairobi in
Kenya. All cases were in children under 5 years of age who had not been
immunized against measles. There was one death in a child who was 10 months
old.
All the cases were from 2 communities, the Somali and Ethiopian communities
residing in Eastleigh. Eastleigh has a large number of Somalians. The index
case had traveled to a refugee camp in Northern Kenya.
The measles immunization coverage for Eastleigh is around 80 percent. The
reason these children were not immunized was because some of them had
recently migrated to Nairobi from Somalia and the refugee camps in Northern
Kenya. These communities do not use public health facilities because they
are suspicious of the authorities.

[Dr Sharif's report highlights the success of a well-organised measles
immunisation programme in an East African country and the tragic
consequences of failure to embrace immunisation by other communities. It
will be relevant, however, to establish whether the outbreak occurred
through exposure of non-immune children to an indigenous strain of measles
virus, or whether the virus was introduced into Eastleigh with the migrant
families. - Mod.CP]
