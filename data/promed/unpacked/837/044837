[The first outbreak of peste des petits ruminants (PPR) in Israel occurred in 1993, most likely introduced from Lebanon, and since then has been endemic. Mass vaccinations with a live-attenuated PPR vaccine, are applied according to the following regime:
- offspring from unvaccinated sheep/goats: starting from age day 1
- offspring from vaccinated sheep/goats: from age 2 months
- both groups above boostered at age 4-6 months
- adult sheep/goats: annual revaccinations.

The annual numbers of PPR outbreaks affecting sheep and goats in Israel between 1993 and 2020 are available on page 22 of the Veterinary Services most recent annual report (2020) at https://www.gov.il/he/departments/publications/reports/doch-shnati-vet-2020.

PPR infecting susceptible livestock following its introduction into endemic environs should not surprise.

Vaccination, in case required from imported livestock (such as FMD, PPR) is expected to confer protection if applied before their export or during a quarantine period in the importing country. Israel maintains 10 (privatized) import quarantine stations. During 2020 (last available VS report), more than 330 000 sheep were imported through the said facilities.

PPRV isolates from Israel belong to linage IV and form a single strong regional cluster; a single incursion was implied (see citation). Incidentally, the current outbreak in Hazor'im is located 6.3 km (about 3.9 mi) (south) from the location of the primary, 1993 event, in Moshav Arbel (map at https://tinyurl.com/4rvcuedb).
