Notice to Travelers about Avian Influenza A (H5N1); 11 Aug 2005
---------------------------------------------------------------
(Released on 16 Mar 2005; and previously updated on 14 Apr, 20 Jun and 29 Jul
2005)
According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report on 5 Aug 2005, the
Ministry of Health in Viet Nam has reported an additional 3 human cases of
avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection: one in the northern province of Ha
Tay, one in the southern province of Tra Vinh, and one in Ho Chi Minh City,
also in the south. The patients from Tra Vinh and Ho Chi Minh City died. These
newly confirmed cases in Viet Nam bring the total reported there since mid-
December 2004 to 63 cases, 20 of which have been fatal.
During December 2003 to August 5, 2005, a total of 112 human cases of avian
influenza A (H5N1) were reported in Viet Nam (90), Thailand (17), Cambodia (4)
and Indonesia (1), resulting in 57 deaths. For more information about avian
influenza A (H5N1) infections in humans, visit:
- the WHO website <http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/en/>
- the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website
<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/index.htm>
[and the ProMED-mail web-site <http://www.promedmail.org> - Mod.JW].
Most cases of H5N1 infection in humans are thought to have occurred from
direct contact with infected poultry. Therefore, care should be taken to avoid
contact, when feasible, with live, well-appearing, sick, or dead poultry and
any surfaces that may have been contaminated by poultry or their feces or
secretions. Transmission of H5N1 viruses to 2 persons through consumption of
uncooked duck blood may also have occurred in Vietnam in 2005. Therefore,
consumption of uncooked poultry or poultry products, including blood, should
be avoided. To date, there has been no evidence of sustained person-to-person
spread of influenza A (H5N1) virus.
To reduce the risk of infection, Americans [and others] visiting areas where
outbreaks of H5N1 infection among poultry or human cases of H5N1 infection
have been reported should observe the following measures to help avoid illness.
Before any international travel
-------------------------------
(1) Always educate yourself and others who may be traveling with you about any
disease risks in areas you plan to visit (for information about H5N1, see this
web page for more information:
<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/index.htm>).
(2) Be sure your vaccinations are up to date and see your doctor or health-
care provider, ideally 4 to 6 weeks before travel, to get any additional
vaccinations, medications, or information you may need. CDC's health
recommendations for international travel to Southeast Asia are provided on
CDC's Travelers' Health website:
<http://www.cdc.gov/travel/seasia.htm>.
(3) Assemble a travel health kit containing basic first aid and medical
supplies. Be sure to include a thermometer and alcohol-based hand rub for hand
hygiene. See this page for other suggested items:
<http://www.cdc.gov/travel/other/travelers-health-kit.htm>.
(4) Before you leave, find out how and where to get medical care in the
country where you are traveling.
(5) Check your health insurance plan or get additional insurance that covers
medical evacuation in case you become sick. Information about medical
evacuation services is provided on the U.S. Department of State Web page
titled Medical Information for Americans Traveling Abroad, at
<http://travel.state.gov/travel/tips/health/health_1185.html>.
During Travel
-------------
(1) Avoid all direct contact with poultry, including touching well-appearing,
sick, or dead chickens and ducks. Avoid places, such as poultry farms and bird
markets, where live poultry are raised or kept, and avoid handling surfaces
contaminated with poultry feces or secretions.
(2) As with other infectious illnesses, one of the most important preventive
practices is careful and frequent hand-washing. Cleaning your hands often,
using soap and water (or waterless alcohol-based hand rubs when soap is not
available and hands are not visibly soiled), removes potentially infectious
material from your skin and helps prevent disease transmission.
(3) Hand-washing is especially important when preparing raw poultry for
cooking (including during cooking classes).
(4) Influenza viruses are destroyed by heat; therefore, as a precaution, all
foods from poultry, including eggs and poultry blood, should be thoroughly
cooked. See International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) for
guidelines about food safety and H5N1 at
<http://www.who.int/foodsafety/micro/avian/en/>
(5) If you become sick with symptoms such as a fever, difficulty breathing, or
cough or with any illness that requires prompt medical attention, a U.S.
consular officer can assist you in locating medical services and informing
your family or friends. See this page for more information about what to do if
you become ill while abroad:
<http://www.cdc.gov/travel/o ther/illness-abroad.htm>.
It is advisable that you defer travel until you are free of symptoms unless
your travel is health-related.
After your return
-----------------
(1) Monitor your health for 10 days.
(2) If you become ill with fever and develop a cough or difficulty breathing,
or if you develop any illness during this 10-day period, consult a health-care
provider.
Before you visit a health-care setting, tell the provider the following: 1)
your symptoms 2) where you traveled and 3) if you have had direct poultry
contact or contact with a known or suspected human case of influenza A (H5N1)
in an H5N1-affected country . This way he or she can be aware you have
traveled to an area reporting avian influenza.
For more information about H5N1 infections in humans, visit the World Health
Organization (WHO) website and the CDC Avian Influenza site,
