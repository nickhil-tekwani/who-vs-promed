The genetic variant rs12252-C was present in 69 per cent of Chinese patients with H1N1 swine flu [influenza A/(H1N1)pdm09]. A genetic variant which explains why Chinese populations may be more vulnerable to H1N1 swine flu has been found by researchers at the University of Oxford and Beijing Capital Medical University. This finding could help identify those at high risk of severe infection and help prioritise those in highest need of treatment.

The study, led by Dr Tao Dong of the University of Oxford, showed that people with a specific genetic variant are 6 times more likely to suffer from severe influenza infection than those without. The particular variant rs12252-C is occasionally found in Caucasian populations and was already known to be associated with more severe influenza disease. However, the research teams in the UK and China showed that this variant was present in 69 percent of Chinese patients with severe pandemic (swine) influenza in 2009 compared with 25 percent who only had a mild version of the infection. The results are published today [29 Jan 2013] in the journal Nature Communications. The study was part-funded by the Medical Research Council.

Dr Tao Dong of the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine at Oxford University says: "Understanding why some people may be worse affected than others is crucial in improving our ability to manage flu epidemics and to prevent people dying from the virus. It's vital that we continue to fund research that examines flu from the smallest details of our genetic code in the populations around the world that continue to be vulnerable to infection."

The results suggest that the gene variant increases the severity of, rather than susceptibility to, influenza infections. It is thought that the DNA change increases risk of severe infection by limiting the effectiveness of a protein which helps to defend against influenza and similar viruses. This protein, known as IFITM3, has been previously shown to slow down virus replication in mice.

Professor Andrew McMichael, co-author of the study at the University of Oxford, says: "The apparent effect of this gene variant on the severity of influenza is of great interest. It remains to be seen how this gene affects the whole picture of influenza in Southeast Asia, but it might help explain why new influenza viruses often 1st appear in this region of the world."

Yong-Hong Zhang et al. Nature Communications 4, Article number: 1418 doi:10.1038/ncomms2433 29 January 2013 http://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v4/n1/full/ncomms2433.html.

During the 2009 pandemic, hospitals in China admitted patients with severe infection but also, unusually, patients with mild infection who, under normal circumstances, would not require hospitalization. This "open-door" policy provided a unique opportunity to capture a relatively unselected group of patients with divergent outcomes, observed and managed under similar clinical conditions.

The introduction provides the background and rationale for this investigation. "The SNP rs12252-C allele alters the function of interferon-induced transmembrane protein-3 increasing the disease severity of influenza virus infection in Caucasians, but the allele is rare. However, rs12252-C allele is much more common in Han Chinese. The authors report that the CC genotype is found in 69 percent of Chinese patients with severe pandemic influenza A H1N1/09 virus infection compared with 25 percent in those with mild infection. Specifically, the CC genotype was estimated to confer a 6-fold greater risk for severe infection than the CT and TT genotypes. More importantly, because the risk genotype occurs with such a high frequency, its effect translates to a large population-attributable risk of 54.3 percent for severe infection in the Chinese population studied compared with 5.4 percent in Northern Europeans. Interferon-induced transmembrane protein-3 genetic variants could, therefore, have a strong effect on the epidemiology of influenza in China and in people of Chinese descent."

The authors conclude that: "These data clearly extend the earlier observation in a European cohort that the IFTM3-rs12252CC genotype is significantly associated with influenza severity. The association is primarily with severity of disease rather than susceptibility to infection, although larger studies are required to prove this specific association. IFITM3 may have an important role in virus replication and dissemination following the initial infection. The much higher level of the CC genotype in the Han Chinese population compared with Caucasians may place the Chinese at a higher risk for developing severe illness upon influenza infection. It is not known whether those who are more severely infected with influenza virus are more likely to spread the infection. If this is the case, the high frequency of the C allele in Asian populations may influence the epidemiology of influenza." - Mod.CP
