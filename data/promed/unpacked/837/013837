An man has died while 9 are admitted after eating a hippo carcass in Embu county. The man, from Karuku village in Mbeere South [constituency], was taken to Embu Level Five Hospital mortuary on Monday [26 May 2014] and the 9 are admitted at the hospital.

Police said [people] found the dead hippo on [18 May 2014] and took the meat. Mbeere South deputy county commissioner Lyford Kibaara yesterday [27 May 2014] said the hippo was found on the banks of Sagana River at the boundary between Embu, Machakos, and Muranga counties and residents from the 3 counties [butchered] and feasted on it. Kibaara said the residents started swelling. He said they suspect the hippo had anthrax, which killed it.

Kibaara said they have organised a free vaccination camp at Makutano [in the former Rift Valley Province] shopping Centre today [28 May 2014] for all those who ate the hippo. He said victims have reported contradicting stories as they were fear prosecution if found guilty of killing the hippo. Mbeere South police boss Bernstein Shari said they are investigating the incident. He said they have not established whether residents killed the hippo or they found it dead.

Kibaara and Shari asked residents not to eat meat from carcasses as they can not be sure of what killed the animals and if the meat is fit for consumption. Shari said the residents claim they found 2 hippos fighting and one was badly injured. The injured hippo died and they shared the meat.

Embu Level Five Hospital medical superintendent Dr Gerald Nderitu said that the 9 patients are responding well to treatment. Victims at the hospital said they shared the meat with their neighbours.

[Recognising that hippopotami are belligerent animals and dangerous to be anywhere near, logic would suggest that the suspect animal was either dead or moribund when butchered by these villagers. If it were sick, a junior bull seeing his opportunity could well have challenged him.

There is missing information from this report. There is no firm diagnosis, whether of the human death and cases, or from the hippo carcass. "Vaccinating" humans exposed to anthrax is not a usual procedure, normally one would provide oral antibiotics. That they appear to have human anthrax vaccine on hand is a mite surprising. It would be appreciated if any of our Kenyan members would share any further information that they might have on this incident. Past experience of anthrax in African hippos would make one suspect that there may well be multiple hippo carcasses lying out there. - Mod MHJ
