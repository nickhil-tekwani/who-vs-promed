Thousands of Cambodia's cows hit by foot-and-month disease
--------------------------------------------------
Thousands of Cambodian cattle and oxen have been hit by foot-and-mouth
disease [FMD] since the beginning of the rainy season, local newspaper The
Cambodia Daily reported Monday [25 Jul 2005].
The disease, which weakens adult animals and kills calves, has affected
Kompong Chhnang and Kompong Thom provinces the most, Yim Voeunthan,
Agriculture Ministry secretary of state was quoted as saying.
"There are more than 10 000 sick animals in Kompong Chhnang," he said.
"This is a forest area and cows are easily infected from the water flowing
from the forest."
Yim Voeunthan said that vaccines have been given to 1.5 million oxen
nationwide to control the spread of the disease.
"This year is the worst ever for this disease," Deputy Governor of Kompong
Chhnang King Sarim said.
In developed countries, mass slaughter of infected cows is the recommended
procedure, but Cambodians are too poor for this policy, the newspaper said.
Yim Voeunthan said that Cambodia cannot export cattle because FMD is
widespread in the country. Many Cambodian farmers depend on cows and
buffaloes for their livelihoods.

[Information from Cambodia on the serotype of the FMD virus involved, on
the composition of the vaccine applied, and on the health situation in pigs
is required. FMD is endemic in Cambodia; the last time samples were sent
from Cambodia to the World Reference Laboratory for FMD at Pirbright was in
2000, when serotype O was identified.
Recent serotyping of samples sent from Southeast Asian countries to
Pirbright reveals the presence of serotypes O (Viet Nam, Myanmar, Hong Kong
and Thailand), A (Thailand) and Asia 1 (Hong Kong). The spread of serotype
Asia 1 throughout China has been recently reported, with one penetration
into Russia (Amur). - Mod.AS]
