Following the announcement of more than 100 deaths in one month in the locality of Dekin, Dangbo commune, the mayor of the commune, Clement Gnonlonfoun, was reached by telephone yesterday [28 May 2013], and responded: "The event announcing an epidemic in Dekin is a hoax created by a priest, seeking attention in the press..."

Mayor Gnonlonfoun explained that in these times of rain and chronic unhealthiness in the Oueme Valley, several cases of children with anemia caused by malaria have been reported. Thus, in his words, more children in Dekin, a lake district of the Dangbo municipality, were victims of malaria and anemia.

But he pointed out that the priest from the Dekin Catholic Church and the Dangbo District chief have given false information in the public opinion [the press]. "We investigated the [situation] last Sunday and Monday [26/27 May 2013] in Dekin. In the past 2 months, there have been 4 deaths due to anemia following malaria. The priest and the CA [district chief] who disseminated misinformation said they also heard the news without telling us their sources.

"They were unable to show us the 100 graves and relatives of the victims ...," he added. He also argued that this was an obvious disinformation campaign for unknown reasons. However, he said that he led a delegation of the Ministry of Health and the city of Dangbo and a variety of doctors and laboratory technicians from Dekin, on Sunday [26 May 2013] and last Monday [27 May 2013], to find the facts.

To believe his words, solutions are being found for the situation in the Dangbo commune, and in Dekin in particular. "We provided the Dekin health center with a crisis team and a large supply of free medicines for use in treating patients in order to reinforce the fight specifically against malaria and anemia. ...", said the mayor of Dangbo.

Oueme-Plateau: false alert of an epidemic killing children in Dekin
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The deputy chief of staff of the Ministry of Health, Dr Aboubacar Moufadilou, went to the locality of Dekin in the Dangbo lakeside commune, on Monday (27 May 2013), accompanied by a large delegation of the Ministry and of local officials, where they were apprised of the misinformation distributed by the media stating 100 children had died.

[According to the newswires above, it seems that the newswire report posted by ProMED-mail earlier this week (see Undiagnosed deaths - Benin: (OU) RFI 20130528.1740478) was erroneous and reflected panic on the part of the population. It appears that there have been 4 deaths in the affected area (Dekin, Dangbo commune, Oueme department) that were due to severe complicated malaria.

Before closing this thread, ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate more information from knowledgeable sources in the region to validate the newswires.

According to Wikipedia, Dangbo is a town, arrondissement [district], and commune in the Oueme Department of south eastern Benin. The commune covers an area of 340 sq km (131 sq mi) and as of 2002 had a population of 66 055 people. A map of the location (available at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangbo) shows that Dangbo is located very near the border with Nigeria.
