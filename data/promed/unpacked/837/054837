A mysterious parvo-like illness that has killed more than 30 dogs in northern Michigan is canine parvovirus, diagnostic testing by the Michigan State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory has revealed. It is still unclear why dogs are testing negative for the virus.

Although the affected dogs tested negative for parvo at clinics and shelters, diagnostic tests conducted by the Michigan State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory confirmed the illness was parvo, according to a news release from the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD).

The affected dogs presented parvo signs and did not have a history of completed vaccination against the virus, the release said. Parvo, a severe and highly contagious illness among dogs, is characterized by vomiting and bloody stool. Dogs are dying within 3 days of showing signs.

"This situation is complex because although the dogs displayed clinical signs suggestive of parvovirus, they consistently test negative by point-of-care tests performed in clinics and shelters," said MSU VDL director Kim Dodd, DVM.

While clinical tests are valuable in guiding veterinary care, they aren't as sensitive as the diagnostics performed at the MSU lab, she said.

"We continue to further characterize the virus in hopes of better understanding why those animals were testing negative on screening tests," Dodd said.

More than 30 dogs have died in Otsego County related to the outbreak, Melissa Fitzgerald, Otsego County Animal Shelter/Control director, told MLive. At least that many have also died in Clare County, the Clare County Cleaver reports.

Local animal shelters and animal control have reported that some of the affected dogs were vaccinated, but MDARD says none of the dogs were fully vaccinated.

The vaccine series must be delivered on a specific schedule, and the vaccine must be kept at an exact temperature to be effective, Fitzgerald said.

The parvovirus vaccine is highly effective and is the best way to protect dogs against the potentially deadly virus, said State Veterinarian Nora Wineland, DVM.

"Dogs not fully vaccinated against this virus are the most at risk," Wineland said. "Dog owners across Michigan must work closely with their veterinarians to ensure their dogs are appropriately vaccinated and given timely boosters to keep their pets safe and healthy."

MDARD is encouraging all dog owners to take steps to protect their animals:

- Keep up with routine vaccinations against canine parvovirus, rabies, canine distemper, adenovirus, parainfluenza, and leptospirosis.
- Fully vaccinate dogs/puppies before they interact with other animals.
- Keep dogs/puppies at home and away from other dogs if they are exhibiting any signs of illness, and contact your veterinarian.
- Clean up after pets when walking them in public.

"The discovery of these cases should not cause dog owners to drastically change how they care for their pets or where they plan to travel," MDARD said in a statement. "If dogs are fully vaccinated against canine parvovirus, they are protected against severe illness, but it is important to always consult with your veterinarian."

Canine parvovirus is not contagious to people or other species of domestic animals. The disease is common in Michigan.

Update from state veterinarian on parvo-like illness in northern Michigan dogs

The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) continues to work with partners to learn more about reports of a canine parvovirus-like illness in northern Michigan dogs by facilitating additional testing.

"We are still in the early stages of this investigation, but some of the 1st samples submitted to the Michigan State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory were positive for canine parvovirus. However, there are more results pending and more to be learned," said State Veterinarian Nora Wineland, DVM. "When MDARD first learned of these cases in northern Michigan, we immediately reached out to the veterinarians and animal shelters involved and began our response efforts. Protecting animal and public health is one of the department's key pillars, but it is a team effort. Dog owners need to ensure their pet is up to date on routine vaccinations, as it's the 1st step in keeping your pet healthy."

MDARD is encouraging all dog owners to take a few simple steps to protect their animals:

- Keep up with routine vaccinations (especially for those living in or traveling with pets to the northern Lower Peninsula) by ensuring dogs/puppies are vaccinated against canine parvovirus, rabies, canine distemper, adenovirus, parainfluenza, and leptospirosis.
- Have dogs/puppies fully vaccinated before interacting with other animals to help keep them healthy and safe.
- Keep dogs/puppies at home and away from other dogs if they are exhibiting any signs of illness, and contact your veterinarian.
- Be sure to clean up after your pet when you're walking them out in public.

Canine parvovirus is not contagious to people or other animals and is not a reportable disease to the state veterinarian's office. Veterinarians are advised to contact MDARD if unusual or reportable conditions in animals are seen.

MDARD continues to work with local animal control shelters, area veterinarians, the Michigan State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, and other partners to learn more about this situation and protect Michigan's dogs.

[It is sad to hear how many animals succumbed to this preventable virus. When it comes to parvovirus, you need all of a series of 3 or 4 vaccines before your pet is fully protected. Furthermore, after the initial series of vaccines, dogs need to be vaccinated annually. Skipping any of these vaccines can leave your pet vulnerable to this disease.

I am sure MDARD will be investigating the brand of vaccine these animals may have had and if there was a problem with the vaccine getting hot on the way from the product manufacture to the veterinarian. Lot numbers will likely be scrutinized.

The investigation may prove to be difficult for clinics as well as owners as MDARD seeks to sort out what may have happened.

Reportedly one of the deceased animals was sent for necropsy, and perhaps they can culture the virus to learn if there are any molecular changes. We are sorry for the owners and the veterinarians involved. - Mod.TG
