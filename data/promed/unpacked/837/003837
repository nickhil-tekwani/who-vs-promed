India (Andhra Pradesh & Maharashtra): suspected viral encephalitis outbreak
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of encephalitis -- an inflammation of the brain caused by a
mosquitoborne virus -- has killed at least 146 children in India in the
past 2 weeks, many because they were not treated in time, officials say.
Hundreds of children are in hospitals and more suffering convulsions and
high fever are being admitted every day in southern Andhra Pradesh state
and neighboring Maharashtra.
The outbreak has been severe because of the onset of the annual monsoon,
which creates ample breeding ground for mosquitoes. "The children are dying
because they are not treated when they show the first signs of the
symptoms," doctor VR Bhutada, dean of the Government Medical College in
Nagpur, east of Bombay, told Reuters by phone on Tue 15 Jul 2003. "Early
medication would have helped many children survive."
At least 102 children aged between 2 and 12 years old have died in Andhra
Pradesh and another 44 in Maharashtra. Bhutada said that parents, mainly
poor farmers and laborers, had traveled from remote villages to the
hospital with their ailing children but were largely ignorant about the
early stages of the illness. Hundreds of children admitted to hospital
since the outbreak began in June 2003 suffered acute symptoms such as
headache and vomiting, and some were admitted partially comatose.

[Previously it was reported that preliminary testing at the "New
Delhi-based National Institute Communicable Diseases and Pune's National
Institute of Virology" had identified Japanese encephalitis virus as the
cause of this outbreak, but there has been no subsequent confirmation. More
information on this outbreak, which appears to be spreading to the
neighboring state of Maharashtra, would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
