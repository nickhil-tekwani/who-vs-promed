The Panama Ministry of Health has reported 47 cases of hantavirus nationally through 12 Nov 2022. There are 27 cases classified as hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome and 20 as hantavirus fever. Of these cases, 3 have died, with the latest a 29-year-old patient from Soná de Veraguas. The province of Los Santos has the highest rate of confirmed cases, followed by the health regions of Herrera, Coclé, West Panama and Veraguas.

[This report provides an updated case total (47 with 3 deaths) that is more than the last ProMED total for Panama (39 with 2 deaths) reported in our 22 Sep 2022 posting (see Hantavirus - Americas (29): Panama (VR) 20220927.8705813). A relatively small number of febrile disease and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS) cases caused by hantavirus infections occur every year in Panama. Given the seriousness of HPS, which can lead to death, the occurrence of hantavirus-caused disease in Panama is worth tracking, and efforts by residents, especially in rural areas, to avoid contact with rodent hosts of the virus is an important preventive measure.

Although the above and the previous reports do not indicate which hantavirus is responsible for these cases, an earlier WHO report indicates that based on genomic sequence analysis, Choclo is the hantavirus identified in those previous cases (see Hantavirus - Americas (02): Panama WHO 2018 review 20190106.6245148). Curiously, Choclo virus is never mentioned in the popular press reports that come to ProMED from Panama, including this one. The virus is endemic in Panama.

Earlier, Dr Jan Clement suggested that Seoul hantavirus might be involved in some of the cases in the Americas, including Panama. The rodent reservoir of Seoul virus is the ubiquitous brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_). Presumably, genomic analysis by the Gorgas Lab would have detected this virus. Nonetheless, diagnostic laboratories should be aware of this possibility and look for it.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be seen at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents live in and around agricultural areas and the adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces, and saliva, the source of human infection. - Mod.TY
