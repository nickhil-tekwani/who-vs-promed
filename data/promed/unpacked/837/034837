The Minnesota Board of Animal Health today [3 Dec 2008] announced
that 3 mature cows sent to slaughter from a buyout herd in Beltrami
County tested positive for bovine tuberculosis (TB). The herd is
located in the state's Modified Accredited Zone, within the
Management Zone. This finding will not result in a downgrade of
status for this area or the state.

The disease was initially detected during routine slaughter
surveillance, when a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
veterinarian detected suspicious lesions on 3 animals. Tissue samples
were submitted to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL)
in Ames, Iowa, where a diagnosis of bovine TB was confirmed. The cows
were systematically traced back to the herd using the Animal Movement
Certificate and individual identification. The remaining cattle in
the herd have been quarantined.

The Beltrami herd owner was participating in the state-funded herd
buyout program, along with 45 other producers located in the
Management Zone. The aim of the buyout program, authorized by
legislation signed into law this year [2008], is to eliminate herds
located in the area where the disease has been known to exist.

"This positive finding validates the entire buyout program," said
Minnesota Bovine TB Coordinator Joe Martin. "We have found positive
herds in this area before, and we knew it might happen again,
especially in older animals such as these. By removing higher risk
cattle from the Management Zone and working to decrease the deer
population, we are carrying out our strategy of eradicating the
disease. And that's good news for everyone involved."

The Board of Animal Health has received 45 herd buyout contracts
signed by cattle producers in the bovine tuberculosis (TB) Management
Zone. The Board estimates that 6800 cattle will be removed from the
TB disease management area as a result of the buyout program. To
date, more than half the animals have been removed. All animals that
are part of the buyout must be removed from the zone or be
slaughtered by 31 Jan 2009. Producers taking part in the buyout
program will not be allowed to keep livestock in the Modified
Accredited Zone.

The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) reports testing
approximately 1250 deer this fall [2008] hunting season in the
northwest for the disease and did not detect any obvious cases of
bovine TB in the deer sampled. "While this is encouraging news," said
Michelle Carstensen, DNR Wildlife Health Program Coordinator, "final
test results are pending and should be available in early 2009."
While the total number of infected deer found since 2005 remains at
24 cases, DNR plans to continue management efforts this winter [2008]
to minimize the risks of this disease persisting in the local deer
population.

The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says 3 cows from a herd inside
the state's bovine tuberculosis management zone have tested positive
for the disease.

Officials say the cows were from a herd participating in the state's
buyout program, which was implemented to remove cattle from the part
of the state where bovine TB has been found. The cows tested positive
at slaughter.

State veterinarian Dr. Bill Hartmann says the finding won't change
Minnesota's bovine TB status. Currently, the state has a split
status, with an area in northwestern Minnesota considered "modified
accredited" and the rest of the state upgraded to "modified
accredited advanced." Hartmann says it's possible for the area in
northwestern Minnesota to keep its status as long as it doesn't go
over a limit on the number of herds testing positive for the disease
in a 2-year period.
