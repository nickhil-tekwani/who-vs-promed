Cuban independent journalists and dissidents have filed three reports of
dengue in Havana during the last month. All these reports are accessible on
the INTERNET in the netsite listed in parentheses.
The first report, "Brote de Dengue en la barriada de Lawton", was filed by
Migdalia Rosado of the human rights organization Tamarindo 34 Derechos
humanos on September 23 <http://www.cubanet.org/CNews/y99/sep99/24a8.htm>.
This report mentions that at least seven cases of hemorraghic dengue have
been detected in the Havana neighborhood of Lawton.
The second report, "Se extiende brote de hepatitis y dengue en La Habana",
was filed by independent UPECI journalist, María de los Angeles González
Amaro on October 11 <http://www.cubanet.org/CNews/y99/oct99/12a4.htm>. This
report mixes news of both hepatitis and dengue outbreaks (>100 cases) and
mentions that two Havana neighborhoods (Marianao and Arroyo Naranjo) are
under an epidemiological alert issued by the Department of Hygiene and
Epidemiology f the Public Health Ministry (MINSAP).
The last and most recent report, "Confirmado brote de dengue en la Habana"
was filed by independent UPECI journalist Pedro Nasco Alvarez on October 18
<http://www.cubanet.org/CNews/y99/oct99/19a1.htm>. This report mentions
four cases of dengue that UPECI was able to confirm through its sources. It
names one female patient who served recently in Honduras as part of a
Cuban medical mission in that country. The female patient's address is
listed as well as the fact that she is a medical doctor.
There has been no reports of dengue in Cuba in the official press. I
apologize in
advance for the lack of scientific information available in these reports
but I feel that it is important that this scant information be available to
a wider audience to be confirmed or denied by the relevant authorities.

Although it has not been officially admitted, UPECI [Sorry, I do not know
what this is. - Mod.CHC confirms the existence of dengue in the 10th of
October district of the capital. 4 cases have been reported so far, one in
Luyano & the others in Reparto La Sola in Vibora.
According to sources in the _Aedes aegypti_ eradication service, the
[virus was brought back by Cubans who were performing medical services in
Honduras in the wake of Hurricane Mitch. Mosquito eradication services
have been intensified in the affected zones.

[As a separate, but tenuously related, issue, the Cuban Government has
taken steps to sue the United States Government for waging "germ warfare"
on Cuba in the 1980's. As I have been named as an accomplice in this
so-called matter, and the law suit is asking for $160,000,000,000 (or so)
in damages, it is likely that my VISA card will soon be maxed out. - Mod.CHC
