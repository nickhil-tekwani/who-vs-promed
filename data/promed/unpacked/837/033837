Outbreaks of _Salmonella_ infections linked to backyard poultry
---------------------------------------------------------------
Since the last update on 24 Jun 2020, 473 more ill people and 4 additional _Salmonella_ serotypes (Braenderup, Muenchen, Thompson, and Typhimurium) were added to this investigation.

As of 28 Jul 2020, a total of 938 people infected with one of the outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ have been reported from 48 states.

Total / 938

Illnesses started on dates from 14 Jan 2020, to 14 Jul 2020. Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 94 years, with a median age of 32. 56 percent are female. Of 461 people with information available, 151 (33%) have been hospitalized. One death in Oklahoma has been reported.

If antimicrobials are needed, some infections related to these outbreaks may be difficult to treat with some commonly recommended antibacterials and may require a different choice. Whole genome sequencing performed on _Salmonella_ bacteria isolated from 597 ill people predicted resistance to one or more of the following antibiotics: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (1.4%), ampicillin (4.0%), cefoxitin (1.4%), ceftriaxone (1.4%), chloramphenicol (0.8%), ciprofloxacin (0.1%), fosfomycin (2.8%), gentamicin (1.2%), kanamycin (0.4%), streptomycin (63.4%), sulfisoxazole (4.4%), tetracycline (63.5%), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (2.6%). There was no resistance predicted for 249 (29.4%) isolates. Testing of 10 outbreak isolates using standard antibiotic susceptibility testing by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory confirmed these results (fosfomycin and kanamycin were not tested by this method).

Investigation of the outbreaks:
Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence shows that contact with poultry (such as chicks and ducklings) in backyard flocks is the likely source of these outbreaks. In interviews, ill people answered questions about animal contact in the week before they became ill. Of 409 people interviewed, 303 (74%) reported contact with chicks and ducklings before becoming ill. Testing of backyard poultry and their environments (such as backyard coops) in Kentucky and Oregon found 3 of the outbreak strains.

Ill people reported buying poultry from many sources, including agricultural stores, websites, and hatcheries. No single store chain or hatchery accounts for all of the illnesses. Regardless of where backyard poultry are purchased, they can carry _Salmonella_ bacteria that can make people sick. Backyard poultry owners should always follow steps to stay healthy around their flocks.

This investigation is ongoing, and CDC will provide updates when more information becomes available.
