Scientists have linked an invasive mosquito to an unusual outbreak of malaria in Ethiopia. _Anopheles stephensi_, native to southern Asia, was first identified in Africa a decade ago in the Republic of Djibouti, which borders Ethiopia. It has since spread to at least 4 other countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Now, amid lingering questions about whether the insect's presence is significantly driving cases of malaria on the continent, researchers have confirmed that people infected in an uncommon dry season outbreak of the disease were more likely to have the mosquito living close to their homes.

The find, reported today [1 Nov 2022] at the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH) meeting in Seattle, is the most direct evidence yet that ties the invasive insect to increasing malaria cases, says Martin Donnelly, an evolutionary geneticist at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) who was not involved in the study. "It is a big step forward" in understanding how _An. stephensi_ is likely to make malaria much more difficult to control in Africa, where it kills more than half a million people each year, most of them children under age 5.

Unlike most of the mosquitoes in Africa that transmit the parasites that cause malaria, _An. stephensi_ is a city dweller. Most African mosquitoes lay their eggs in rainy-season puddles, but it thrives in artificial water sources such as cisterns and barrels of clean drinking water. That enables the insect to stay active during dry seasons, which traditionally provide a respite from the disease.

In Djibouti and elsewhere, malaria cases went up at the same time that _An. stephensi_ was identified, but scientists were not sure whether the new mosquito or other factors were to blame. To better understand the role of the invasive insect, Fitsum Tadesse, a molecular biologist at the Armauer Hansen Research Institute in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and colleagues tracked cases of malaria in Dire Dawa, a city in eastern Ethiopia that experienced a large outbreak earlier this year [2022]. In 2019, the city only had 205 cases all year. This year, Dire Dawa recorded more than 2400 cases in the 1st half of the year.

Tadesse and his colleagues tested household members of 80 malaria patients and compared them with household members of 210 people who did not have the disease. They found that household members of malaria patients were 5.6 times more likely to be infected than the control family members. Households with malaria cases also had more mosquito breeding habitats within 100 meters of their homes than control households, the team reports today [1 Nov 2022] at the ASTMH meeting. Most important, 97% of the adult mosquitoes collected were _An. stephensi_.

The find is an important confirmation that _An. stephensi_ is responsible for the sudden increase in malaria cases, says Marianne Sinka, an entomologist at the University of Oxford who studies malaria-transmitting mosquitoes but who was not involved with the study.

Epidemiologist Anne Wilson, who has been tracking the spread of _An. stephensi_ in Sudan and Ethiopia with her colleagues at LSTM -- but who was not involved with the work -- agrees. The new species was a key suspect in outbreaks, she says, but direct evidence had been lacking. Still, she says, more studies are needed to confirm the species' role in other regions.

The invasive mosquito's rise is bad news for controlling malaria across Africa. Not only can it thrive in regions that had been safe from malaria outbreaks, but the strains of _An. stephensi_ that have been found in Africa are also largely resistant to the most widely used insecticides, so bed nets treated with them don't kill the insects. And they prefer to rest in animal shelters -- barns or sheds -- rather than human homes, which makes them harder to target. Tadesse suspects _An. stephensi_ is already even more widespread than the 6 known African countries, hitching rides in shipping containers. "It's likely you could find it in all corners of the continent."

Public health officials have stepped up their efforts to survey for and control the mosquito, with the World Health Organization in September [2022] declaring a new initiative to stop its spread. Creative approaches will be needed, Donnelly says. _An. stephensi_ is fond of feeding on cattle, he notes, so treating livestock with insecticides may help. The most promising strategies target water sources, most experts agree. One tactic is to keep cisterns, wells, and other water storage locations covered so adults can't lay their eggs in them. Another option is to add an insecticide that targets the immature mosquitoes in their larval stage.

Those approaches could have side benefits, Wilson notes. Mosquitoes in the _Aedes_ genus, which transmit dengue and other diseases, also breed in cisterns and wells, so control methods could help control those diseases as well.

[_Anopheles stephensi_ was first detected on the African continent in the Horn of Africa, and Tadesse's group has previously shown that _A. stephensi_ is the major vector of _P. falciparum_ and _P. vivax_ in urban Ethiopia (ref. 1). _A. stephensi_ has more recently been found in Nigeria and other sub-Saharan African countries, so it is likely that this mosquito species will spread to other areas of sub-Saharan Africa where _A. gambiae_ is the major mosquito host for _P. falciparum_. The dynamics of malaria transmission would therefore be more complicated, but there may well be a higher overall incidence of falciparum malaria if the 2 species occupy different ecological niches (urban vs rural, dry season vs wet season, etc.), and both are equally competent vectors for _P. falciparum_ development within the mosquito (as limited studies to date seem to indicate; ref. 2). As if this were not enough cause for concern, many additional rare species of _Anopheles_ have also been found to contain _P. falciparum_, at least in western Kenya (ref. 3). The involvement of many different _Anopheles_ species in the transmission of malaria will likely require quite different control strategies, such as one for rural vectors and one for urban vectors (which, as pointed out, may have the additional benefit of targeting other disease vectors such as _Aedes_ and _Culex_ mosquitoes).
