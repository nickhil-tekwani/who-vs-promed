According to the Control of Communicable Diseases Manual, all mammals are susceptible to rabies. No mention of birds. Now, Indian researchers have reported the 1st case of rabies in a domestic fowl, a chicken, in the country, according to a study published in the journal, PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases.[see comment]

The authors note that experimental rabies virus infection in birds has been reported, but naturally occurring infection of birds has been documented very rarely. A few anecdotal reports were published in the late 1950s, indicating the rare occurrence of rabies in birds; however, they remain uncorroborated by lack of additional reports with robust laboratory evidence of naturally acquired rabies in birds.

The chicken (_Gallus domesticus_) was bitten by a stray dog and died a month later. Its carcass was sent to the rabies diagnostic laboratory. The brain tissue was positive for rabies viral antigens by fluorescent antibody test (FAT) confirming a diagnosis of rabies. Additional analysis revealed that the rabies virus strain from the domestic fowl belonged to a distinct and relatively rare Indian subcontinent lineage.

The authors say the significance of this finding indicates that spill-over of infection even to an unusual host is possible in highly endemic areas. In addition, butchering and handling of rabies virus-infected poultry may pose a potential exposure risk.

Researchers conclude the present report indicates that rabies is a disease that can affect birds. Lack of obvious clinical signs and fewer opportunities for diagnostic laboratory testing of suspected rabies in a bird, may be the reason for the disease in these species being undiagnosed and probably underestimated.

"Abstract:
A great horned owl (_Bubo virginianus_) was fed the carcass of an experimentally infected rabid skunk. The bird developed antibody titer to rabies, detected by passive haemagglutination, 27 days after oral inoculation by ingestion. The owl suppressed the infection until corticosteroid administration, after which a maximum antibody titer was attained. Evidence of active rabies viral infection was seen by fluorescent antibody staining of oral swabs, corneal impression smears and histologic tissue smears, by suckling mouse inoculation of oral swab washings, and by transmission electron microcopy. No clinical signs of rabies virus infection were observed".

The authors of the current Indian paper included the following text in their discussion:

"Lack of obvious clinical signs and fewer opportunities for diagnostic laboratory testing of suspected rabies in a bird, may be the reason for the disease in these species being undiagnosed and probably underestimated. The locality of the bird in the present case is highly endemic for rabies and the presence of an easily accessible diagnostic facility may be the reason the disease could be identified in poultry. Most often birds succumb due to shock or complication of animal bite injury and may not survive until the development of clinical rabies infection".

ProMED-mail's moderators had their deliberations before posting this unusual observation from Kerala, eventually opting to do so, allowing discussion. - Mod.AS
