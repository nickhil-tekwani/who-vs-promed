[The identification of HPAI H5N1 in a single feral dove in the city of
Moscow may be regarded as indicative of a wider circulation of the virus in
wildlife (or contact with uncontrolled, internationally traded pet/wild
birds?). Russia's Central Federal District, where Moscow is situated, has
not been affected by H5N1 since 2007. In February 2007, 3 backyard bird
flocks were found infected with HPAI H5N1 in the Moscow oblast. According
to the epidemiological comment in the official OIE notification, submitted
19 Feb 2007, "Live bird market "Sadovod" in Moscow is suspected to be a
source of infection as birds bought at this market were introduced in the
backyard flocks indicated above."

Results of the current isolate's genotyping, reportedly already undertaken
by the All-Russian Research Institute for Animal Health, particularly in
relation to previous isolates, are awaited with interest.

The feral pigeon (or "rock dove") _Columba livia_, has been included since
2004 in the list of species known to be affected by HPAI H5N1, as published
by the USGS (United states Geological Survey). 2 other species belonging to
the order _Columbiformes_ are listed as well. The list is available at
<http://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/disease_information/avian_influenza/affected_species_chart.jsp>.

The numbers of reported HPAI H5N1 outbreaks, in Russia, during the years
2005-2008 were as follows: 2005 -- 117; 2006 -- 93; 2007 -- 23; 2008 -- 1.
