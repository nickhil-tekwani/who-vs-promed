[1] Aerosol production during exhalation
Date: Tue 27 Oct 2020

https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/10/why-people-are-coronavirus-superspreaders-how-body-emits-infectious-particles/


In 2003, when SARS had infected thousands, killed hundreds, and caused a worldwide scare, Lidia Morawska was studying the effects of inhaling fine particles of pollution. But then the World Health Organization asked Morawska, a physicist at the Queensland University of Technology, to join a team in Hong Kong trying to understand how the coronavirus that causes SARS was spreading.

Morawska decided to take an unconventional approach. Rather than look at how people inhale contagious matter from one other, she dug into the reverse process: exhalation. "I found 3 papers investigating anything to do with exhalation of particles from human respiratory activities. There was basically next to nothing," she says. "This amazed me because this is such an important area, such a critical area."

Almost 2 decades later, the rapid spread of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus has reignited interest in research into how our lungs launch infectious material into the air, namely the tiniest respiratory droplets called aerosols. Understanding how aerosols form in the body is crucial to figuring out why this virus spreads so readily and what's fueling so-called superspreading events, where a small number of disease carriers end up infecting many individuals. Such incidents are a hallmark of COVID-19.

Since Morawska began her investigations, scientists have learned a lot about airborne respiratory fluids and, in particular, what might make someone a superspreader, or superemitter. Certain attributes, such as the shape of one's body, and certain behaviors, such as loud talking or breathing fast, appear to have a major role in spreading the disease.

"They're not sneezing. They're not coughing. They're just breathing and talking," says Donald Milton, an aerosol transmission expert from the University of Maryland. "They might be shouting. They might be singing. Karaoke bars have been a big source of superspreading events. We saw one at a spin cycle club up in Hamilton, Ontario, where people are breathing hard."

However, figuring out who are the most prodigious producers of aerosols has proven difficult -- with many biological and physical factors affecting aerosol generation that are tough to parse out or even measure.

Say it, don't spray it
-----------------------
To aerosol scientists like Morawska who are more focused on the physics, an aerosol is any particle, wet or dry, that can be suspended in the air for minutes to hours. Aerosols are usually less than 100 micrometers in size, or about the width of a human hair. The human respiratory tract produces a wide variety of aerosols, from tiny droplets only a few micrometers across to globules around 100 micrometers, and even gobs bigger than aerosols that are visible with the naked eye and are more typically described as respiratory droplets.

"The smallest aerosols are generated in the deeper part of the respiratory tract," Morawska says. These are especially important for disease transmission because they can stay aloft longer and travel farther compared to the big gobs that fall quickly. These smallest aerosols are created within the bronchioles, the thin, branching airways deep within our lungs. By carefully measuring the aerosols produced by people when they breathe in different ways, Morawska and colleague Graham Richard Johnson proposed in a seminal 2009 paper that the respiratory fluid lining these tubes creates films that burst like soap bubbles when the bronchioles contract and expand. This is now considered to be the main mechanism that creates aerosols deep in the lungs.

Something similar happens higher up in the respiratory tract, in the sound-producing larynx. "The vocal folds are opening and shutting too fast really for the naked eye to see," says William Ristenpart, a chemical engineer at the University of California, Davis, who studies disease transmission. Much like the bronchioles, these folds pull apart respiratory fluid when they are slamming together during speech and singing, creating tiny droplets. Imagine vigorously washing your hands, and the soapy film rupturing as you pull them apart.

This process happens very fast, a hundred or so times a second, and the droplets it creates hitch a ride on exhaled air -- which brings us to the oral cavity. The largest droplets of the respiratory tract are generated in the mouth, with its flapping lips and its saliva-laden acrobatics of speech, and these are the ones you probably know best.

"In talking especially, sometimes you can feel little droplets flying out," Ristenpart says. "That's where 'Say it, don't spray it,' comes from."

While the nose is also a path for aerosols to escape, the main route is through the mouth. All the aerosols and droplets are trapped in an explosive puff of gas, which governs their movement and spread for the 1st few seconds. "The gas cloud in fact keeps the drops that were emitted concentrated as it moves forward in a room, carrying them within it," says Lydia Bourouiba, a fluid dynamics scientist at MIT.

More droplets, coming right up!
-------------------------------
Though the general mechanics that create respiratory aerosols are the same among people, a large amount of variation exists between how much spray individuals actually produce. Look at a crowd of people standing by a bus stop on a cold day, and you'll notice everyone's breath fog looks different in terms of size.

This shouldn't be surprising, considering the complexity of the respiratory tract. Morawska uses the analogy of a perfume bottle's more uniform mist: "Unlike in the perfume bottle, where there's only one tube, there's many different passages in the respiratory tract -- passages of different widths and different lengths."

To quantify this complexity even for a single person would be cumbersome, but scientists can still spot those who excel at making aerosols. In a 2019 study, Ristenpart and his colleagues showed that the louder someone speaks, the more aerosols they emit. However, the scientists also found that some participants in their study produced an order of magnitude more aerosols than others-even when speaking at the same volume. These people have become known as superemitters.

"Clearly there's got to be some type of underlying physiological reason that causes people who are speaking at about the same amplitude and the same pitch to emit wildly different numbers of particles," Ristenpart says. One possibility, he says, is that the thickness of the fluid and how it reacts to deformation can vary between people. Previous research has shown that inhaling salt water mist that's less viscous than mucus-packed respiratory fluid made individuals produce fewer aerosol particles overall. On the flip side, folks with fluid that is naturally higher viscosity may be producing more aerosols.

Complicating matters is that a respiratory infection can cause changes in the respiratory fluids. For example, the viscosity of the respiratory lining increases during bronchial infections such as bacterial pneumonia and severe influenza due to the loss of water and increased production of cellular proteins. Chronic conditions like asthma and cystic fibrosis can also thicken up the fluids.

Probing individuality
---------------------
Answering the many questions that remain is challenging due to the nature of aerosols themselves. For example, the particles are sensitive to environmental conditions, and the bigger ones with more liquid can dry out quickly, leaving behind mostly tiny, more concentrated particles that skew readings. The temperature, humidity, and air flow within scientific instruments can also change the aerosols one is trying to measure.

These nuances call to mind the peculiarities of quantum mechanics, where conducting a measurement on a subatomic particle influences the result. Though these aerosols are much larger, measuring their ephemeral nature is similarly challenging.

Morawska acknowledges this challenge with a chuckle. "Being able to measure and give an answer which represents what's actually happening is extremely difficult," she says.

These difficulties, in part, have stymied the study of disease transmission by aerosols for decades. "Even now, in 2020, how influenza spreads is controversial," says Ristenpart, who recently published a study showing that flu viruses may piggyback on dust particles.

But this field of science is having a moment in the spotlight now due to COVID-19. Aerosols have helped reveal why the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is even more transmissible through the air than the original SARS of 2003. Many experts now agree that better ventilation of indoor environments and masking can help curb this aerosol-borne disease. That's why Morawska, Milton, and many of their colleagues in aerosol science called in July for more focus on airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via aerosols, which the CDC and WHO are now beginning to emphasize.

[Its complicated!

The WHO Scientific brief titled 'Transmission of SARS-CoV-2: implications for infection prevention precautions' summarizes this succinctly:
"Some studies conducted in health care settings where symptomatic COVID-19 patients were cared for, but where aerosol generating procedures were not performed, reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in air samples, while other similar investigations in both health care and non-health care settings found no presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA; no studies have found viable virus in air samples.

Within samples where SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found, the quantity of RNA detected was in extremely low numbers in large volumes of air and one study that found SARS-CoV-2 RNA in air samples reported inability to identify viable virus. The detection of RNA using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based assays is not necessarily indicative of replication- and infection-competent (viable) virus that could be transmissible and capable of causing infection.

Recent clinical reports of health workers exposed to COVID-19 index cases, not in the presence of aerosol-generating procedures, found no nosocomial transmission when contact and droplet precautions were appropriately used, including the wearing of medical masks as a component of the personal protective equipment (PPE). These observations suggest that aerosol transmission did not occur in this context. Further studies are needed to determine whether it is possible to detect viable SARS-CoV-2 in air samples from settings where no procedures that generate aerosols are performed and what role aerosols might play in transmission.

Outside of medical facilities, some outbreak reports related to indoor crowded spaces have suggested the possibility of aerosol transmission, combined with droplet transmission, for example, during choir practice in restaurants or in fitness classes. In these events, short-range aerosol transmission, particularly in specific indoor locations, such as crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces over a prolonged period of time with infected persons cannot be ruled out. However, the detailed investigations of these clusters suggest that droplet and fomite transmission could also explain human-to-human transmission within these clusters. Further, the close contact environments of these clusters may have facilitated transmission from a small number of cases to many other people (e.g., superspreading event), especially if hand hygiene was not performed and masks were not used when physical distancing was not maintained" (https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/transmission-of-sars-cov-2-implications-for-infection-prevention-precautions). - Mod.UBA]

[2] Aerosol transmission: ferret study
Date: Wed 28 Oct 2020

https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/ferret-study-reinforces-role-of-aerosols-in-sars-cov-2-spread-68094


As the COVID-19 pandemic has unfolded, researchers have hotly debated the primary method of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus--via relatively large respiratory droplets, which fall quickly to the floor under their own weight, or smaller aerosolized droplets capable of circulating in the air for long periods of time. A study posted to the preprint server bioRxiv last week [19 Oct 2020 see reference below] adds yet more evidence that infectious virus can be spread via aerosolized droplets.

"If I were someone who thought that large droplets were the way [that SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted] and if I were skeptical about aerosols, this study might make me rethink my assumptions," says Virginia Tech engineer Linsey Marr, who studies how viruses spread through aerosols and was not involved in the study.

Although observational data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 spreads between people at short distances, experimental studies of aerosolized transmission have been limited. Researchers have found the virus in latent hospital air of rooms with infected patients and have established that normal speaking likely pumps infectious aerosols into the air. Still, few studies have directly tested airborne transmission experimentally, so the study authors turned to ferrets, which have been a classic model for studying infectious disease transmission, as ferrets and humans share similarities in lung physiology and cellular receptor distribution.

To study virus transmission, Herfst and his colleagues stacked 2 ferret containers on top of one another, connected only by a 15 cm-wide duct made of PVC pipe with four 90-degree turns. They infected each of 3 groups of 4 ferrets, called "donor ferrets," with a different virus. One set received SARS-CoV-2; another group got SARS-CoV, the virus responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak; and a 3rd was infected with H1N1 influenza, the virus behind the 2009 flu pandemic, as a positive control. "The proof for airborne transmission in humans is super limited, and you can't do those experiments in humans for obvious reasons," says Erasmus Medical Center virologist Sander Herfst, the senior author of the new study.

The researchers placed each donor ferret by itself in the bottom of the 2-cage apparatus and a single healthy ferret, called the "indirect recipient ferret," in the top cage, with a steel grate closing both ends of the duct to trap any food, feces, or other large particles. A fan carried air from the bottom cage to the top cage at 100 liters per minute. If COVID-19 transmission were only possible via large droplets, the researchers hypothesized that no indirect recipient ferrets should become infected, as the steel mesh, the duct's right-angle turns, the one-meter distance between animals, and gravity should all work against large droplets rising to the top cage.

University of California, Davis, engineer William Ristenpart, who studies the dispersion of airborne pathogens and was not involved with the study, says the experimental setup mimics classic experiments from the 1960s investigating the transmission of influenza. "The little serpentine ductwork they have really prevents ballistic droplets to be carried upward in the airflow," he tells The Scientist.

The researchers swabbed the ferrets' noses and throats every other day to measure the amounts of viral RNA and infectious virus present. By the end of the 13-day experiment, all indirect recipient ferrets in the influenza and SARS-CoV groups had caught the viruses from the donor ferrets, while two of the four SARS-CoV-2 recipients were infected. The 4 donor and 4 recipient ferrets infected with SARS-CoV became seriously ill, exhibiting breathing difficulties and less activity than usual, while those infected with SARS-CoV-2 were fully asymptomatic.

"It's another brick in the edifice of evidence for long-range aerosol transmission," says Ristenpart.

The efficiency of long-range SARS-CoV-2 transmission in ferrets may also point to why the virus has spread so aggressively through minks, which also belong to the Mustelidae family, Herfst says. Millions of minks have been culled in the Netherlands and Denmark due to virus outbreaks.

Historically, scientists have considered aerosols to be particles smaller than 5 microns across, although Marr says she does not know how that number was derived. In a letter published in Science earlier this month [16 Oct 2020], Marr called for the size threshold to be raised to 100 microns, noting that particles larger than 5 microns can behave as aerosols -- lingering in the air, rather than dropping to the ground shortly after being emitted.

The authors of the new study note that they found particles larger than 10 microns at the entrance of both cages, but they could not specify their maximum size or their composition, a limitation of the aerodynamic particle sizer they used. They suspect that the particles came from the lower cage because of the direction and high speed of the airflow.

Ferrets groom themselves by licking their fur, which could send a cloud of virus-laden fur particulates into the air. The study authors found tiny amounts of viral RNA but no infectious virus on the fur of the SARS-CoV donor ferrets. Ristenpart, who helped find that guinea pigs could transmit influenza through aerosolized fur particles in an August study published in Nature Communications, says he appreciates that the authors discussed the possibility that the virus could be transmitted via fur particles.

Although the authors acknowledge that their experiments do not "discriminate between transmission via small aerosols, large droplets, and fomites," Marr says she thinks it's highly unlikely that particles larger than 50 microns traveled to the upper cage based on the cross-sectional area of the duct, the speed of the air, and the 90-degree turns.

The study comes weeks after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention acknowledged that the novel coronavirus can spread via aerosols. The agency updated its guidelines to include airborne transmission in mid-September [2020], but removed the language the next day. If the virus were found to spread among people predominantly through aerosols, Marr says, that would carry practical implications for recommendations of types of masks and ventilation systems best suited to filter out airborne particles.

Now that Herfst has found that the virus transmits effectively through the air, he says he hopes to next tackle how long infectious virus can be detected in the air around infected ferrets, which would help answer how long individuals remain contagious.

[The study mentioned in the above report and others strongly argue for the role of aerosol/ route of transmission for SARS-CoV2. There is growing evidence that in addition to contact and droplet spread, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via aerosols is plausible under favorable conditions, particularly in relatively confined settings with poor ventilation and long duration exposure to high concentrations of aerosols, causing the World Health Organization (WHO) and other agencies to review their guidance. Recently WHO acknowledged aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2, especially in closed indoor settings, and that aerosol transmission could not be ruled out from some reported outbreaks (https: //www. who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-how-is-covid-19-transmitted)

Precautionary and control strategies to mitigate the possible aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 should be implemented under different occasions based on risks. Settings with a large proportion of infected people or contaminated samples, such as hospitals, healthcare institutions and laboratories are the highest risk, especially to HCWs, who should be provided airborne precautions. The general public and vulnerable populations should be made aware that confined, crowded and poor ventilation environments may pose a medium risk when an infected person is present. Factoring in asymptomatic spreaders, hand hygiene, use of masks and social distancing are the key protective measures going forward in the near and foreseeable future. - Mod.UBA]

[3] Europe: lockdowns
[A] Germany, France
Date: Wed 28 Oct 2020
Source: CNN [edited]
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/28/europe/europe-new-lockdowns-announced-intl/index.html


Two of Europe's biggest economies have announced lockdowns in response to spiraling coronavirus case numbers.
France will begin a 4-week lockdown on Friday [30 Oct 2020], French President Emmanuel Macron said Wednesday [28 Oct 2020].

His declaration came just hours after German Chancellor Angela Merkel also announced a 4-week nationwide lockdown starting next Monday [2 Nov 2020].

Macron announced the French measures in a televised address on Wednesday [28 Oct 2020] evening, saying existing restrictions were "not enough anymore." By mid-November [2020], all intensive care beds could be taken by Covid-19 patients unless a "brake" is put on the virus, he warned. Under the French lockdown, people will need a certificate to move around. Non-essential businesses, restaurants and bars will be closed. Schools and workplaces will remain open, and care homes visits will be allowed. However French people will only be allowed outside to go "to work, to go to a medical appointment, to care for a relative, to do shop for essential goods and to get some air," Macron said.

"The virus is circulating at a speed that even the most pessimistic had not predicted," he said, adding that the curfew imposed in Paris and other administrative areas did not dent the spread of the virus.

France's lockdown will last until [1 Dec 2020] at "minimum," according to Macron.

German restaurants, bars and clubs will also be closed in order to "avoid a national health emergency," according to Merkel. People residing in Germany are advised to stay home, avoid travel and "keep their contacts to an absolute minimum," she said. Social contacts will be limited to two households in public. Schools and kindergartens will remain open, but have to take strict hygiene measure to do so.
Germany's restrictions will be reassessed in two weeks time, Merkel said.

Though strict, the new guidelines in both countries are less harsh than lockdowns imposed this spring, which brought Germany and France to a standstill.

The coronavirus pandemic has been intensifying in the European Union as winter approaches, with infections skyrocketing through the continent. France has one of the highest coronavirus infections rates relative to its population in the European Union, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The agency's figures show it has 659.9 cases per 100 000 inhabitants over the past 14 days.

On Tuesday [27 Oct 2020], France reported 34 591 new confirmed cases and 530 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University (JHU) data, bringing its total to 1 279 384 confirmed cases and 35 820 deaths.

Jean-François Delfraissy, who leads the scientific council that advises the French government, warned on Monday [26 Oct 2020] that France could have about 100 000 new coronavirus cases per day, as many may be undiagnosed or asymptomatic cases. The French Hospital Federation, which represents 4800 hospitals, warned of capacity issues in a statement on Wednesday [28 Oct 2020]. The group said in a statement that a full lockdown was the "only solution" and would permit French hospitals to "successfully treat all French people, whether they have Covid, whether they have any other serious illness or are affected by a serious accident." France's "hospital system will not hold without radical measures," federation president Frédéric Valletoux said in an interview with the French radio station France Inter, adding that hospitals are struggling with lower numbers of medical personnel compared with spring's peak.

Germany was lauded for its pandemic response during the 1st wave, thanks to widescale testing and its fast response to the outbreak which has helped keep its Covid-19 mortality rate relatively low -- despite a high number of reported cases. As it struggles with the 2nd wave, the country has seen the number of intensive care admissions double, Merkel said. "I want to say what makes the situation particularly serious... the rate of dissemination is particularly high," she said. Her announcement came after a meeting with leaders of Germany's 16 federal states to discuss the country's spike in cases, which has seen the state of Bavaria and Frankfurt introduce restrictions that range from curfews to localized lockdowns.

Germany recorded a record 14 964 new daily infections on Wednesday, according to the country's disease and control agency the Robert Koch Institute. The country's total coronavirus case count now stands at 449 275 and the death toll at 10 098, the institute's data showed.

[B] Eastern Europe
Date: Wed 28 Oct 2020

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-28/east-europe-fights-for-its-life-against-virus-it-thought-crushed


The leaders of 7 eastern European countries who gathered in Bled, Slovenia, at the end of August [2020] were so certain they'd overcome the coronavirus that they staged a panel called "Europe after Brexit and Covid-19."

Less than 2 months later, that confidence has been shattered. Despite having beaten back the initial wave with some of Europe's fastest and strictest lockdowns, countries from the Baltic to the Black Sea are suffering an explosion of new cases. Their early advantage squandered, governments across the region are struggling with the same issues as their western counterparts -- or often worse.

Soaring death tolls and a spate of high-profile infections are eroding trust and feeding into a communist-era tradition of skirting rules, exacerbating the crisis. Field hospitals are popping up as the virus threatens to overwhelm health-care systems and measures that devastated economies this spring are returning.

"The coming months, quarters -- I hope it isn't years -- will be the toughest Poland has faced in decades," Polish Premier Mateusz Morawiecki told parliament last week.

Morawiecki was on stage at Bled along with leaders from the Czech Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia. Since then, coronavirus cases have more than tripled in Poland to exceed a quarter of a million on Monday [26 Oct 2020]. Deaths there more than doubled to 4438, according to the World Health Organization.

And it's not even the region's worst-hit country. The Czechs now lead the European Union both in new cases and deaths per capita, followed by Hungary.

It didn't start that way. When Slovakia reported just 5 cases of the virus on [9 Mar 2020], its capital Bratislava closed elementary schools. Within a week, the Czechs shut schools and banned public gatherings, Hungary declared a state of emergency and Serbia postponed elections. All of that happened before France closed its schools, even though it had recorded more than 3000 cases and 79 fatalities.

It was a textbook plan to fight a pandemic: eastern European governments shut borders, shops and factories and imposed social-distancing restrictions. With the virus raging in Italy, the U.S. and the U.K., newspaper headlines in the continent's former communist half declared sympathy while boasting of their countries' resilience and wisdom in following rules.

That resolve melted in the summer and millions went on holiday abroad as soon as borders reopened. Those who stayed home thronged beer gardens, mountain huts and national parks.

Hoping to rebuild after the lockdowns decimated economies and to save key industries such as tourism, politicians urged people to get back out and spend. Having opened the state's coffers to help businesses and furloughed workers, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis, Hungary's Viktor Orban and other leaders vowed that even if the virus returned, they'd avoid strict lockdowns.

Leaders in Western Europe are experiencing a similar sense of dismay. Italy and Spain, had sworn off any 2nd lockdowns. Looking at the situation getting exponentially worse with their eastern neighbors, they too are coming to terms with the idea of whether they also declared victory too soon.

By mid-September [2020], the number of new daily cases in the Czech Republic exceeded those in Germany, a country with almost eight times as many people. They did in Poland too, where President Andrzej Duda won a 2nd term after his allies in the government had to postpone elections. He's now quarantining after testing positive for the disease.

Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov -- another Bled attendee -- is also convalescing with Covid-19, which is on track to kill as many people in his country in September and October [2020] as in the 1st 6 months of the pandemic combined.

Governments, however, are reluctant to return to the playbook that served them so well in the spring, or to tap into what the pandemic has taught the world in the past seven months.

Their mixed messaging, along with frequent rule-breaking by leaders, has spread public doubt about the effectiveness of restrictions. That's especially dangerous in a region where people spent decades circumventing official decrees under communist governments, according to Jan Hartl, chairman of the Prague-based researcher the STEM Institute.

"People in former communist countries perceive authorities differently than citizens in the West," he said. "They intuitively rebel against strict orders from the government since they intuitively consider them stupid. That's a heritage of totalitarianism."

Governments from Prague to Bucharest have tried to once again clamp down. Romanian Prime Minister Ludovic Orban resisted new measures before [27 Sep 2020] local elections and a general ballot planned for [6 Dec 2020] before finally giving in. Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia have closed schools and some non-essential businesses and vowed stricter measures if necessary.

But the message has yet to take hold. At the weekend, as Czech soldiers completed a 500-bed field hospital near a shopping mall in the Prague suburb of Letnany, images flooded media of throngs at a farmers' market in the city center.

Nearly 100 000 people are catching coronavirus every day in England, a major analysis suggests. The study, by Imperial College London, says the pace of the epidemic is accelerating and estimates the number of people infected is now doubling every 9 days. The authors say we are at a "critical stage" and "something has to change".

The government here is sticking to its regional strategy. Experts are warning that we are fast approaching the peak in infections seen in the spring.

The React-1 study is highly influential because it is the most up-to-date assessment of COVID-19 in the country, with the last swabs taken only on Sunday [25 Oct 2020] and nearly 86 000 volunteers taking part. It shows cases are rising in every age group and in every region of England. While cases are currently highest in the North, infections are surging more rapidly in the South.

The study compared the latest swabs collected between [16 and 25 Oct 2020] with the last round of swabs, between [18 Sep 2020] and [5 Oct 2020].

It suggests:
- The number of people infected has more than doubled since the last round, with one in every 78 people now testing positive.
- The hardest hit area is Yorkshire and the Humber, where one every 37 people has the virus, followed by the North West region.
- Three times as many people aged 55-64 are infected and twice as many over 65s.
- The pace of the epidemic has accelerated with the R number - the number of people each infected person passes the virus on to on average - increasing from 1.15 to 1.56.
- Overall, the number of people infected is doubling every 9 days.
- The South East, South West, east of England and London all have an R above 2.0. London has an estimated R of 2.86.
- Cases are spiking in young people in the South West in a repeat of the pattern seen in northern England just over a month ago.
- 96 000 people are now catching the virus every day.

Prof Steven Riley, one of the authors, said he was "really disappointed" when the data started coming in and said it meant the "current measures are not sufficient". "There has to be a change, the rate of growth is really quite rapid, one way or another there has to be a change before Christmas," he said. He argued this could be either the general public following the rules more closely or government imposing tougher restrictions on our lives. "If we are going to consider at some point over the winter something much more stringent it becomes a question of timing. I think these results do argue for something sooner rather than later," Prof Riley said. This study paints a stark picture of where we are and where we could be heading. If there was no change in the reported 9-day doubling time, there would be more than a million infections a day by the end of November [2020].

That is a considerable "if", but it demonstrates the threat posed by the virus if it is allowed to grow exponentially. Somehow, we have to navigate a challenging winter, balancing the virus and the cost of restrictions.

France and Germany have turned to forms of lockdown, albeit not as severe as those endured earlier in the year. The government here is sticking to its regional strategy. But the hardest fact to digest today may be that it is still only October [2020]. Spring, when hopefully the weather and vaccine will make the virus easier to control, is still a long way away.

Prof Paul Elliott, another report author, said "we're at a critical period in the 2nd wave" and that higher cases "will lead to more hospitalisations and loss of life". He said we have to cut the number of people we interact with to curb the spread of the virus.

The government is still hoping its local, targeted restrictions will work, allowing more of the economy to stay open in areas where the virus is less prevalent, according to BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley. But it has also been at pains to say it is ruling nothing out if the virus is out of control - including nationwide measures, he added. It comes after the environment secretary said "it's too early to say" what Covid rules will be in place by Christmas.

George Eustice warned people "may not be able to get together in the larger groups that they normally would".

The government's coronavirus dashboard reported a 310 further deaths across the UK on Wednesday [28 Oct 2020]. But there were glimmers of hope in the report. Cases in the north east of England are still growing, but much more slowly than before. And in the North East and Yorkshire and the Humber, the number of 18-24 year olds catching the virus is starting to fall, although it is rising in older age groups

[Most countries in Europe are experiencing exponential 'second' waves with a variety of restriction measures being put in place to control the spread of the virus. Until such time that a vaccine is available and administered, the stop-gap measures such as lockdown, enforcing distancing etc will have to remain in place , albeit at un-precedented economic and human costs- some ways to go yet... it worked during the early waves and can help stop virus transmission. - Mod.UBA]

[4] USA: low hospitalization rates in areas with high masking
Date: Wed 28 Oct 2020
Source: Forbes [edited]
https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2020/10/28/areas-with-mask-mandates-have-lower-covid-19-hospitalization-rate-study-finds-tennessee-vanderbilt/#a8ab2ab623ef


COVID-19 hospitalizations in Tennessee have risen at a far lower rate in areas that have mask-wearing mandates than those that don't, a new analysis from Vanderbilt University researchers found, reinforcing evidence showing that face masks play a significant role in slowing coronavirus transmission.

The study found that in Tennessee hospitals where less than 25% of patients came from counties with a mask mandate, hospitalizations as of [23 Oct 2020] had risen by more than 200% since [1 Jul 2020]. Hospitals in which 26% to 50% of patients were from counties with mask mandates saw hospitalizations rise by approximately 100% since [1 Jul 2020]. In hospitals where patients came from counties where more than 75% of patients were under mask mandates, there was virtually no change in the level of hospitalizations since [1 Jul 2020], and hospitalizations only slightly increased in hospitals where 51 to 75% of patients were under mask mandates.

The researchers note that areas that have mask requirements also have "greater changes in other community behavior" that could reduce Covid-19 transmission, so the lower hospitalization rates may not be attributable to masks alone. The researchers also make clear that with hospitalizations going up across the state, "masking alone is not a silver bullet" to prevent hospitalizations entirely.

Tangent
The Vanderbilt analysis also tracked mobility data and consumer spending habits and found that lower mobility was associated more with higher Covid-19 rates than stay at home orders, meaning people were less likely to go out if cases were higher in their area than if there were shutdown restrictions in place. As a result, the researchers concluded that "the best way to manage the economic fallout is to definitively manage the virus using proven strategies that can break chains of transmission." "Only when transmission is reduced will individuals feel comfortable participating in activities that support the local economy as they did before the pandemic," the researchers wrote.

Big Number
44 212. That's the number of current Covid-19 hospitalizations in the U.S. as of Wednesday [28 Oct 2020] morning, according to the Covid Tracking Project, out of 465 777 total hospitalizations since the pandemic began. Covid-19 hospitalizations have been surging as cases have risen nationwide, and hospitals across the country are starting to face capacity issues, activate field hospitals and discuss how to ration medical care if needed.

Key Background
The Vanderbilt analysis is the latest in a string of studies to show that face masks play a key role in reducing Covid-19 transmission or reducing the severity of the disease, and health experts including Dr. Anthony Fauci have advocated for a national mask mandate as cases continue to rise across the country. Mask wearing has become a source of partisan controversy, however, exacerbated by President Donald Trump and his allies' refusal to wear masks or impose mask-wearing restrictions. North Dakota and South Dakota, the 2 states currently experiencing the worst Covid-19 cases per capita in the country, are both led by Republican governors who have refused to implement mask mandates even as cases have soared. "Those who don't want to wear a mask shouldn't be shamed into wearing one," South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem wrote in an op-ed for the Rapid City Journal last week, citing sources that "question the effectiveness of masks." White House coronavirus response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said North Dakota had "the least use of masks that we have seen in retail establishments of any place we have been" in a visit to Bismarck Monday [26 Oct 2020], calling the lack of mask-wearing "deeply unfortunate."

[Universal masking and adequate ventilation with fresh air are the simpler yet proven to be effective measures that can make a difference, if they are 'adopted' and implemented . Adoption of these measures requires a behavioural change; 'buy in' by the community at large. This requires an understanding of human psyche for effective health communication and developing information/health messages that can promote and sustain the change. - Mod.UBA]

- The Americas region reported 28.8% of daily case numbers and 31.3% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 19.8 million cases. The USA maintains its dominance, followed by Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Canada. Ecuador and Peru also reported more than 1000 new cases in the past 24 hours.

- The European region reported 49.i9% of daily case numbers and 44.5% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 9.8 million. Countries not reporting cases today (28 Oct 2020) include Spain, Israel, Kazakhstan, Sweden, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. France is dominant, followed by the UK, Switzerland, Italy, Russia, Germany, Netherlands, Poland, Czech Republic, Ukraine, Romania, Austria, Portugal, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Hungary. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours include Georgia, Croatia, Greece, Armenia, Slovakia, and Slovenia.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 6.7% of daily case numbers and 10.4% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 2.9 million cases. Iran is dominant, followed by Iraq, Morocco, Jordan, Libya, UAE, and Oman. Lebanon, Pakistan, Kuwait, and Palestine, each reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000, while Tunisia, Yemen and Djibouti did not report any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The African region reported 1.2% of daily case numbers and 1.8% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.3 million cases. South Africa is dominant, followed by Ethiopia, Kenya, Angola, Reunion, Mozambique, Nigeria, and Uganda. While South Africa remains dominant, the 24 hour new case count is markedly reduced.

- The Western Pacific region reported 0.80% of daily case numbers and 0.38% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.71 million cases. As previously, the Philippines maintains its dominance, followed by Malaysia, French Polynesia, Japan, Guam, South Korea, and China.

- The South East Asia region reported 12.7% of the daily newly reported cases and 11.4% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 8.9 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives. While India is dominant, the 24 hour new case count is markedly reduced.

Impression: The Americas region combined with the European region account for almost 80% of daily reported cases and 69% of the global reported deaths in the past 24 hours. Cases have somewhat reduced in the South East Asian region while overall case numbers remain below 5000 from Western pacific and African regions
