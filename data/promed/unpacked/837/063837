Madagascar's health service ministry says 8 children have died after suffering acute food poisoning believed to have been caused by eating sea turtle meat in northern Madagascar.

The consumption of sea turtles and 24 other fish species by humans is not recommended by experts, as they are known to consume toxic algae that can prove lethal in the summer months.

Police confirmed that all of those who died were children.

In December last year [2017], 8 people died from acute food poisoning in the northern province of Antsiranana after eating contaminated sardinella fish.

[Intoxication from consumption of marine turtles is called chelonitoxism. Symptoms of chelonitoxism vary according to the toxin and include gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea, vomiting and oro-esophageal ulceration, sometimes followed in severe cases by neurologic signs such as paresis, agitation and coma. Despite these hazards and despite the endangered status of all marine turtle species, these turtles are eaten by coastal communities throughout the world. Marine turtles of all species can contain a variety of toxins including heavy metals (e.g. cadmium and mercury), organic compounds (e.g. pesticides such as chlordane and polychlorinated biphenyls) and biotoxins such as those produced by various blue-green algae on which turtles feed.

Children have a lower body mass, and a more sensitive immune system; therefore they may be expected to be more severely affected by chelonitoxism.

Nevertheless, this is a tragedy. Marine turtles should not be considered food.
