Tests performed on specimens from 8 dead buffalos from Baringo district
(not Hell's Gate) in Kenya were negative for Rift Valley Fever (RVF).
Baringo district has reported over 150 human cases of RVF, with 52 of these
confirmed by laboratory tests since late January 2007.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of sera from the animals was
negative, strongly suggesting that the death was not due to RVF. Serologic
testing is ongoing.

[Dr Kariuki Njenga is gratefully acknowledged for this first-hand
authoritative information. The reported results fall in line with Dr Glyn
Davies' comments, included in ProMED-mail posting Rift Valley fever -
Eastern Africa (19): wildlife, susp 20070304.0753: "I spent a great deal of
time during RVFV (Rift Valley fever virus) epizootic periods in Kenya
observing the wild ruminants on properties affected by RVFV in domestic
animals and also communicating with cattle and sheep farmers on RVF
affected farms. At no time, did I nor anyone else, see wild animals grazing
RVFV infected areas with affected cattle, show any clinical disease, which
might have been due to RVFV."
Recent coverage of RVF in the animal domain leaves room for improvement.
While humans have been reported to be sick and dying of RVF in Kenya since
the beginning of December 2006, the 1st official notification on cases in
animals (sheep, goats, cattle, and camels), which reportedly had started on
4 Dec 2006, were submitted to the Office International des Epizooties (OIE;
World Organisation for Animal Health) from Kenya on 9 Jan 2007; see
notification, including map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=4487>.
Human cases in Somalia were initially reported on 12 Jan 2007, following
rumors of abortions in cattle, which have, so far, not been confirmed -- by
laboratory tests -- to be related to RVF.
Tanzania reported outbreaks in sheep, goats, and cattle on 12 Feb 2007,
reportedly having started on18 Jan 2007; see notification, including map,
at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=4782>.
The 1st human cases were reported from Tanzania at the beginning of
February 2007, so far without WHO confirmation. For background and past
experience, see also Dr Peter Roeder's contribution in ProMED-mail posting
Rift valley fever - Eastern Africa: Somalia, Kenya 20070112.0164.
Domestic ruminants, namely sheep followed by goats and cattle, are known to
demonstrate high susceptibility, manifested by mass abortions while
mortality in young lambs and kids expected to reach nearly 100 per cent.

Distribution of vaccines against the Rift Valley Fever (RVF) has started in
infected areas according to the minister for livestock development, Mr
Anthony Diallo.
The 1st batch of vaccines against the deadly disease arrived from South
Africa last Friday [2 Mar 2007]. The vaccine is administered to livestock.
About 500 000 doses, were ordered by the government 2 weeks ago and were
immediately dispatched for distribution in affected areas -- Arusha,
Manyara, Kilimanjaro, Morogoro, and Tanga regions. "The distribution of the
vaccines has already started and we want to see it speeded up," Mr Diallo
told reporters.
Officials and experts have urged inhabitants of Arusha to handle and
prepare carefully meat and other animal products before eating them. Meat
and milk should not be consumed raw or half done. Signs and symptoms of RVF
[in humans] include flue-like illness with fever, weakness, back pain,
dizziness, and weight loss. Diagnosis can be made by laboratory tests.

[Timely livestock vaccination will reduce economical losses of breeders; it
can also be an effective means of preventing cases of human RVF, if
adequate vaccination coverage and herd immunity are achieved.
The vaccine obtained by Tanzania from South Africa is probably commercial
live-attenuated (Smithburn) vaccine produced in Onderstepoort. This vaccine
will confer protecting antibody levels within a relatively short period but
is known to be abortogenic. Should pregnant animals be vaccinated,
subsequent abortions might cause reluctance of herders to vaccinate or to
cooperate with the vaccinators. Directions for use are available at
<http://bigfive.jl.co.za/pdf_files/p2153.pdf>.
The safer, inactivated, vaccine requires booster vaccinations and is more
laborious and expensive. This is the vaccine of choice in non-endemic
situations (RVF-free countries/regions) and prior to the commencement of
outbreaks in endemic regions. Directions for use are available at
<http://bigfive.jl.co.za/pdf_files/p2146.pdf>. - Mod.AS]
