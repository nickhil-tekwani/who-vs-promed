A 40-year-old man from Oman with underlying medical conditions. He was 1st admitted to a hospital in Muscat on [15 Feb 2014] and was then readmitted to hospital in Abu Dhabi on [17 Mar 2014].

[There are a number of questions that come to mind in reading the WHO case description on this newly reported case of MERS-CoV infection. There is mention that the individual was hospitalized in Muscat (Oman) on 15 Feb 2014 and then re-admitted to hospital in Abu Dhabi over one month later on 17 Mar 2014. As the individual has a history of underlying medical conditions, one wonders whether this story is one showing a possible risk factor of nosocomial transmission? The history provided mentions no history of travel outside of Oman and the UAE and no history of contact with animals or known laboratory confirmed cases. Was this individual admitted to hospital in Oman for his underlying medical conditions? When was he discharged from the hospital in Oman?

With the addition of this case, the global total of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported by WHO is now 200, including 85 deaths. This tally does not include the 3 cases (including one death) reported on the Saudi MOH website and reported in ProMED-mail's post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (17): Kuwait, UAE, Saudi Arabia, WHO, RFI 20140320.2345849, nor does it include the 3 cases reported on the Saudi MOH website and reported in ProMED-mail's post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (18): Saudi Arabia 20140321.2347610. The addition of these 6 cases (including one death) will raise the global tally of laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection to 206 including 86 deaths.
