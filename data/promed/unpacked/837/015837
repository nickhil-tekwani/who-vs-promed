A new variant strain of Newcastle disease, which decimated poultry
production at Mangrove Mountain in April, has been discovered. For at least
6 weeks after producers began to restock, regular testing of every farm
found no strain of the widely prevalent Newcastle Disease virus - something
of a surprise to vets.
In fact, the rigorous on-farm testing program had been in place since
farmers restocked in July was just in the process of being scaled back when
birds on 6 properties were found with worrying strains of the virus.
The NSW (New South Wales) Chief Veterinary Officer, Dr Dick Jane, confirmed
the return earlier this month of what he believes was the forerunner of the
virulent strain of Newcastle disease which led to the slaughter of two
million birds.
There is no [present risk to humans, Dr Jane said. "What we are worried
about is the viruses we've found could mutate into the virulent strain and
we're worried maybe this has already happened," he said.
However, mortality rates at this stage are normal and no disease is present
in any of the chickens. When the news that a new strain of Newcastle
disease was back at Mangrove Mountain, poultry farmer George Sidiropoulos
couldn't sleep for four nights.
The 70 district poultry producers have been to hell and back inside a year.
Again, he feared the worst.
But, after a snap vaccination program when nearly 4 million chickens were
treated in 48 hours, Mr Sidiropoulos is sleeping easier.
The last of his batch of 70,000 birds, free of disease, were sold last
night and he is confident the NSW Agriculture plan to swamp the virus with
a safe viral strain for 6 months will see the mountain free of problems.
"We panicked when I first heard about it. It was the worst news I could
hear just before Christmas."Two properties - both without birds - have been
put under quarantine because the virus found there was 1 genotype further
from the safe strain, Dr Jane said.
Other flocks will be monitored closely for several weeks to check for the
incidence of disease. Farmer representative Shaun Rodger said many
producers remained close to the wall.
"Have we recovered? It depends on what you mean by recovered. Emotionally
and physically no; financially, definitely not," he said. "If we had
another outbreak with the same down time as we had in April then I think 40
to 50 per cent of us would be out of business."
Nearly half the region's farmers are still receiving food handouts to
survive while waiting on a decision about their application for federal
Exceptional Circumstances assistance.
