Smallpox vaccine would be offered to all health care workers, starting with
emergency room workers and moving to doctors in private practice, and
eventually extended to the general public under a Bush administration plan
in the final stages of development.
The plan would begin vaccinations for those at the greatest risk of
encountering a patient with the highly contagious disease, which experts
fear could be used in a bioterrorist attack. The first to be vaccinated
would include infectious disease specialists and emergency room personnel,
including doctors, nurses, technicians, even security officers working at
hospitals and clinics, according to officials familiar with the
administration's planning.
This first group probably will include more than 1 million people, one
official said, although precise numbers won't be known until states are
given guidelines and figure out how many people they cover.
The shots carry a risk of serious side effects, including death, so
authorities estimate that only about a third to a half of those offered
vaccinations will take them. In the end, they believe that several hundred
thousand -- maybe half a million -- will wind up getting the shots.
Officials cautioned that plans still could change. They expect to announce
a decision by the end of the month [September 2002].
Smallpox hasn't been seen in this country in decades; routine vaccinations
ended in 1971. In 1980, the disease was declared eradicated from the globe,
but experts fear hostile nations or terrorist groups may acquire the virus
and unleash it.
The plan on the table would vaccinate people in stages, based on risks they
face.
In the second stage, shots would be offered to other health care workers,
including those in private practice and others who work in hospitals but
are not at direct risk, officials said. At some point, emergency personnel,
such as police and firefighters, also would be offered the shots.
"It's going to be a staged program where ultimately all health care workers
will be vaccinated,'' said one official involved in the planning, speaking
on condition of anonymity. Ultimately, the vaccine will be offered to the
general public, he said, adding: ``It will take years for that to happen.''
In addition, plans are being put into place to vaccinate the entire
population immediately should that become necessary. Officials will
evaluate side effects of the vaccine before moving to each new group, he added.
For federal officials -- including President Bush, who will have the final
say -- the challenge is balancing the risk of the vaccine, which is known,
with the risk that smallpox might return, which is not known. Top health
officials say they have to assume that would-be terrorists have the virus
and might use it.
"My gut tells me you have to assume the worst right now with
bioterrorism,'' Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson said in
a recent interview.
Using similar logic, Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., a leader on bioterrorism
questions, said last month [August 2002] that all Americans should be
allowed to decide for themselves whether to get the vaccine.
Others argue that any specific person faces a very low risk of ever seeing
the disease but faces a certain risk from the shot. About one in 1000
people vaccinated will face complications, some serious, and the vaccine
will kill one or 2 out of every million people who get it.
Using this logic, in July a federal advisory committee recommended limited
vaccinations. They recommended vaccinating small response teams for each
state and a few caregivers at designated hospitals -- probably 10,000 to
20,000 altogether.
"The likelihood of any one health care worker coming into contact with a
case of smallpox, even in the likelihood of an outbreak, would be
exceedingly small,'' said John Modlin of Dartmouth Medical School, who
chairs that committee.
People can be vaccinated effectively against smallpox for several days
after they are exposed; so an urgent round of vaccinations would begin as
soon as a patient had been diagnosed.
As they plan for vaccinations, federal officials face a host of complex issues:
--Recovery time. After vaccination, many are sick for several days. Will
large numbers of hospital workers all be home sick at the same time? Who
pays for the lost hours?
--Liability. If someone dies or gets very sick, who is liable? Thompson has
suggested the government would shoulder legal liability, as it does with
other vaccines.
--HIV/AIDS. People who have weakened immune systems, notably people with
HIV, should not be vaccinated because they are at high risk for severe side
effects. Not everyone who is HIV-positive knows of the condition. Should
people be tested for HIV before vaccination? Should it be mandatory? Who
would have access to the test results?
--Administering the vaccine. Each vial has 500 doses because so little
vaccine is needed for each person. Once the vial is opened, it lasts only
for about 2 weeks. Would people being vaccinated all have to come to the
same place?
Once the program is under way, the key will be frank communication of the
risks and benefits, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, a principal adviser to
Thompson. "We all have to be as honest as we can be and put all the
information on the table,'' he said.
Even before the plan is announced, it has its critics. "They want to be
seen as being proactive in doing something, ''Modlin said in an
interview. "This is a way they can visibly demonstrate the government is
being proactive.''
But others, including Dr. Tara O'Toole, director of the Johns Hopkins
Center for Civilian Biodefense Strategies, say it strikes the right
balance. "Clear, simple, bright lines are hard to come by here,'' she said.

[It seems as though each revision of the proposed smallpox vaccination
strategy for the USA increases the proposed number of prospective vaccinees
among health workers and first responders. As a reminder, the Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendation on 20 Jun 2002
was to vaccinate a small number of first responders in each state,
recognizing that the risk of adverse event following smallpox vaccination
as much higher than the perceived risk of re-introduction of smallpox virus
into circulation in the USA (see Smallpox vaccine, ACIP recommendations -
USA 20020620.4542).
Several weeks following the ACIP recommendation, the next estimate released
for recommended numbers of vaccinees was increased to approximately 500
000. This current proposal suggests that approximately one million health
care workers and other responders will be vaccinated in the first stage,
all health care workers in the second stage, ultimately to be followed by
vaccination of the general population. This suggests that in the long run,
the plan is to re-introduce routine vaccination with smallpox vaccine.
The above newswire report does mention some of the issues that will need to
be addressed before smallpox vaccination can be resumed in the USA. It
does seem to downplay the current unknown risk of a more widespread
vaccination of people in today's era with many more people at risk of
complications (those with eczema, and immunocompromised individuals such
as those infected with HIV, post organ transplant, those undergoing
chemotherapy, those on chronic steroid treatment for disorders such as the
autoimmune diseases) leading mainstream lives, taking public transportation
during crowded rush hours, etc., etc., than when the "risk" data currently
cited were generated. At present there are scientific reasons to believe
that a more widespread use of existing stocks of smallpox vaccine will lead
to significant morbidity and not insignificant mortality in vaccine
recipients and their contacts (see the moderator discussion in Smallpox
vaccine, ACIP recommendations - USA (02) 20020621.4560 discussing the
