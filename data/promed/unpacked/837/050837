Bighorn sheep reappearing in Rock Creek after deadly pneumonia outbreak
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bighorn sheep are appearing along the Rock Creek, Montana, roadside
again, after a devastating outbreak of pneumonia threatened the
herd's survival last winter [2010].

"The pneumonia continued to kill bighorns in upper and lower Rock
Creek in the months following the spring surveys," said Montana Fish,
Wildlife and Parks (FWP) wildlife manager Mike Thompson. "So we
really didn't know how many or how few might survive into the rut
this fall."

The wild sheep started getting sick in January, and FWP wardens
killed 19 in lower Rock Creek in an effort to limit the spread of the
disease. Bands of sheep in the upper end of the drainage were left
alone because the more open terrain offered little chance to keep
healthy sheep isolated from infected ones.

In the past 2 Saturdays, FWP biologists have counted 57 and 59
bighorns, respectively, between 5 and 9 miles up Rock Creek Road.
However, almost no lambs were spotted.

Pneumonia outbreaks are typically followed by poor lamb survival in
the next several years. A similar disease outbreak in the East Fork
of the Bitterroot last winter is bucking that trend, however.
Thompson said the difference was the Bitterroot sheep were in terrain
where aggressive culling of sick animals appears to have kept them
from infecting others.

Hunting opportunities have been eliminated for almost all bighorn
sheep in the disease-hit areas.

[As sickened sheep herds with pneumonia can go up to a decade with
low lamb survival, the best course of actions seems to be culling to
stop the spread before lambing season. Even though bighorn sheep have
returned to Rock Creek roadside -- but without lambs -- the
population will be stable or in danger of decline for the next few
years.

The reader is encouraged to read the previous ProMED-mail post
20100827.3047 about the management of pneumonia by aggressively
culling sick animals to prevent the disease from infecting healthy
animals. In that report the Fish, Wildlife and Parks (FWP) agency
removed 80 sick individuals last fall [2009] and winter, with at
least 87 seemingly healthy sheep remaining. This resulted in the
survival of 32 lambs per 100 ewes in the East Fork. While at another
site where the FWP agency let the disease run its course last winter
[2009], the researcher was unable to find any lambs that had survived
exposure to the pathogens persisting in Rock Creek bighorns.
