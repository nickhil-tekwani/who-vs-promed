With reference to Rabbit hem. dis. - New Zealand: Canterbury, pop.
recovery: I have been involved in research on RHDV for several years
and would, therefore, appreciate it if you could encourage someone in
New Zealand to address the following questions. Please, could you
ascertain the meaning of the word "immunity" used in the reference to
the recovery of the rabbit populations in New Zealand?

1. Does the word mean that the new rabbits are immune to infection?
(I doubt that).
2. Alternatively, does it mean they are genetically resistant to
infection? (a possibility, but one that is usually associated with
newborn rabbits).
3. Or does it mean that the virus is no longer circulating among the
rabbit populations? (quite possible).

I am sure there are other possibilities.

Regarding the 1st question: Is there serological evidence of
immunity, and, if so, from where does this arise?
Regarding the 2nd question: has anyone performed experiments to
demonstrate resistance to the Czech strain that was introduced for
control of the virus?
Regarding the 3rd question: has the disease completely disappeared,
or has anyone identified localized outbreaks?

Each of these 3 scenarios is possible and important if we are to
understand the epidemiology of RHDV.
