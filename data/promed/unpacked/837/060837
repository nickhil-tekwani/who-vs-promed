Date: 16 Dec 2001
From: Daniel S. Shapiro <dshapiro@bu.edu>

[A reader suggested that we post a warning about the laboratory hazard
of culturing _Coccidioides_.
The arthroconidia of _C. immitis_ pose a laboratory hazard, as they
are readily aerosolized. Laboratory accidents are well documented with
this pathogen. All clinical mycology work with growing cultures should
be performed in a biological safety cabinet, and all fungal cultures
should be plated on media that are sealed with tape or a commercially
available product such as shrinkseal to prevent inadvertently opening
the Petri dish outside of a biosafety cabinet.
One difficulty is that on occasion these pathogens will grow
(unexpectedly) on bacterial cultures (such as of a wound) and present
a significant hazard to the medical technologists in the laboratory.
Bacterial cultures are not routinely sealed and are not examined in
biosafety cabinets. A good habit for technologists is to look through
the cover of the Petri dish for the growth of mould prior to opening
it.
