The probability that this could have been an incident involving riot
control agents (RCAs) is reasonably good, and the symptoms do
suggest those that can result from Adamsite and other arsenicals,
but includes also less toxic RCAs like CN and CS. However, NOx
off gases (sic), colored smokes, and fumes from white phosphorus-
type incendiaries are also relatively nasty in & of themselves, and
these are of course very conventional types of munitions.
RCAs are not allowed by the CWC [Chemical Weapons
Convention -- which the Sudan has recently joined -- to be used in
war, although the Sudan could possibly claim domestic use for
control of civilian disturbances. The U.S. reserves the right to use
RCAs in certain circumstances.

The use of riot control agents in warfare is banned. Riot control agents
are defined in the CWC as chemicals not listed in the treaty, "which can
produce rapidly in humans sensory irritation or disabling physical
effects which disappear within a short time following termination of
exposure."
It sounds like the symptoms in the Sudan are not disappearing within a
short time. In that case the use of a chemical to cause the observed
symptoms for hostile purposes is prohibited by the CWC.
