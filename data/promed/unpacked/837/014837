The number of cases of deadly bluetongue virus on British farms has
[according to this story] risen to 129, prompting Britain's most
senior vet to warn that the industry is being "tipped over the edge."

In an official report to the World Animal Health Organisation [OIE],
the Government disclosed the virus has now been found on 64 farms. Of
the 129 cases, 14 have been in sheep, where the disease is most
deadly. There are estimated to be 8 million cattle and sheep in the
100-mile (161-km) protection zones around the infected farms in
Suffolk, Norfolk, Essex, and Kent.

Farmers trapped inside have been unable to move their animals to
other parts of the country. This has meant sheep and cattle that
would normally have been moved to winter pastures elsewhere have been
left stranded on fields that have been grazed out through the summer.

Farmers have called for the zone to be lifted and the entire UK to be
declared infected so animal movements can return to normal.

Nick Blayney, president of the British Veterinary Association, was
cited as saying that experience in northern Europe this year [2007]
showed that the industry was going to face even greater problems next
year [2008] with bluetongue unless a vaccine against the disease is
being produced in time.

Blayney was cited as criticising the government for failing to offer
farmers compensation for animals killed by disease adding that French
and Belgian farmers were compensated for any animals that die from
bluetongue and the carcasses are collected for free.
