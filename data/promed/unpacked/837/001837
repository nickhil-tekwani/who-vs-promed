Around 2.5 million birds at poultry farms in western Mexico have been slaughtered over the past 3 weeks in an attempt to contain an [avian influenza] outbreak, the country's agriculture ministry said on Tuesday [10 Jul 2012].

The virus responsible for the outbreak, H7N3, has occasionally caused human disease in various parts of the world, according to the United Nations, but has not shown itself to be easily transmittable between humans.

Officials visited 148 poultry farms, finding avian influenza in 31 farms, while 34 came up negative and results for the remainder were pending.

Of the 3.4 million affected poultry, "the number of birds that have been sacrificed as a control and eradication measure as of (Mon 10 Jul 2012) is 2.5 million," the ministry said in a statement.

The outbreak was first detected on 20 Jun 2012 in Jalisco state, and the Mexican government declared a national animal health emergency on 2 Jul 2012 in the face of the aggressive epidemic.

After importing one million vaccines from Pakistan, the farming officials said they have developed a seed-based vaccine that they will deliver to 4 laboratories to produce over 80 million doses initially.

Health officials keep a close watch on such outbreaks since so-called swine flu [influenza A/(H1N1) virus] broke out in Mexico in 2009. The H1N1 virus spread into a global pandemic that claimed the lives of 17 000 people.

A shipment of 1 million doses of vaccine from China will be used to inoculate chickens over the next few days to contain an [avian influenza] outbreak, Mexico's National Union of Poultry Farmers, or UNA, said.

According to UNA, the number of farms with a confirmed presence of the flu virus has increased to 29, 5 more than indicated in the previous report, so that the epidemic has now affected close to 2.5 million barnyard fowl in the western state of Jalisco.

In a communique, UNA said that the 1st doses of the vaccine have arrived in Mexico and will be applied to the poultry population most likely to catch the "highly contagious" H7N3 strain of avian flu.

They also reported that the flu has caused the deaths of "at least a million fowl" in the Jalisco municipalities of Tepatitlan and Acatic, either from the virus itself or because they were slaughtered.

According to UNA officials consulted by EFE, another 7 million doses of vaccine are expected to arrive over the coming weeks to immunize a large part of the country's poultry farms.

UNA figures show that Mexico produces close to 2.5 million tons of eggs and 1.2 million tons of feedlot poultry meat per year.

Jalisco contributes 55 percent of national production and by April 2012 had exported close to 4.49 billion pesos (USD 335 million) worth of fresh, powdered, liquid, and cooked eggs, according to estimates of Mexico's agriculture department.

The state governor, Emilio Gonzalez Marquez, said that "the spreading of the virus has diminished" because the infected farms have been kept in isolation.

Once the avian flu virus is eradicated, state and federal authorities will be able to launch strategies to repopulate poultry farms and start recovering the market, above all the US market, Gonzalez said.

The outbreak has already cost 1800 jobs in Jalisco, according to local farmers.

[The outbreak is unfortunate for the Mexican economy and because of the impact it has on the people involved with the animals. We sincerely hope the workers responsible for both depopulation of the farms and for vaccination are using appropriate personal protective equipment to protect themselves from a virus that has the capability of affecting humans. The risk may be deemed small, but the consequences to human health would be real.

These 2 articles list a different number of vaccines from 2 sources, Pakistan and China, yet both articles list almost the same number of birds affected.
