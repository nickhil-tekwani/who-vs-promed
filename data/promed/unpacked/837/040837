Subject: Emergency Management Warning 13: Newcastle Disease Confirmed in
California
Newcastle Disease has Been Confirmed in Commercial Poultry in California
----------------------------------------------------------------
Officials with the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) and
the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) are conducting an
eradication campaign for Newcastle disease (ND). The disease was confirmed
on 1 Oct 2002. Clinical signs in infected birds include respiratory,
nervous, and gastrointestinal signs. Mortality is up to 90 percent of
exposed birds.
On 18 Dec 2002, CDFA received a sick call from a egg layer facility in
Riverside County, CA. One flock from the operation was showing clinical
sign of ND. On 19 Dec 2002, samples were sent to a State laboratory for
testing. Compatible necropsy lesions were discovered that evening. On 21
Dec 2002, the State laboratory had a presumptive positive for ND from
positive serology and PCR results. On 27 Dec 2002, APHIS received
confirmatory virus isolation from the National Veterinary Services
Laboratory (NVSL).
The infected premises is a two flock egg layer operation with approximately
105 000 birds amongst the 2 flocks. One flock has been confirmed positive
by laboratory findings and the other flock is considered a dangerous
contact. All 105 000 birds have been depopulated. The source of infection
is unknown at this time.
Situation Update:
-------------
Investigations are on-going and all figures are pending final validation.
Number of premises positive: 247
Number of contacts: 833
Number of premises depopulated: 600
Premises waiting to be depopulated: 480
Birds depopulated to date: 143 409 (approximate)
Counties with positive flocks: Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino

was 26 Dec 2002.
Effective 13 Nov 2002, the California State Veterinarian has imposed a
quarantine (Food and Agriculture Code Section 9562) on the following
counties:

Orange County, CA, is included in the Newcastle disease surveillance
activities due to the lack of geophysical boundaries between Orange, Los
Angeles, Riverside, and San Bernardino Counties.
Veterinary Services has worked with the U.S. Postal Service to affirm that
poultry will no be able to move out of the quarantined areas through the
mail.
State and federal animal health officials are conducting door-to-door
surveys to identify fowl and other birds in the affected areas and are
following up on epidemiological associations. To date, depopulation,
cleaning and disinfecting, and carcass disposal are being conducted by CDFA
and APHIS. CDFA has closed all poultry exhibits and fairs and expositions
within the State of California.
The Newcastle disease situation is contained is still considered a single
outbreak cluster within a 30-mile radius in Los Angeles County and along the
Los Angeles/Riverside/San Bernardino County border.
Affected and exposed poultry are being euthanized and double-bagged. Task
Force members are disinfecting the bags and transporting the carcasses to
restricted landfills for burial.
All door-to-door surveillance, along with interviews has established that
there have been no links to eastern States within the United States and no
exposure to other poultry in other States.
Local commercial table egg layer birds are being closely monitored and will
only be allowed to move intrastate under CDFA monitoring and spent-hen
movements restricted to the day they are scheduled for processing.
