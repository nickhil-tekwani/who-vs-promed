["Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR), also known as sheep and goat plague, is a highly contagious animal disease affecting small ruminants. Once introduced, the virus can infect up to 90 percent of an animal heard, and the disease kills anywhere from 30 to 70 percent of infected animals. The PPR virus does not infect humans.

"PPR was 1st described in 1942 in CÃ´te d'Ivoire. Since then the disease has spread to large regions in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Today, more than 70 countries have confirmed PPR within their borders, and many countries are at risk of the disease being introduced. These regions are home to approximately 1.7 billion heads - roughly 80 percent - of the global population of sheep and goats" (http://www.fao.org/ppr/en/).

This disease has severe negative socio-economic impacts on the income of livestock farmers and, in particular, the livelihoods and food security of the most vulnerable rural communities, notably of women.

The OIE and the FAO, in their joint strategy (see http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/ppr-portal/gsce/) for control and eradication of PPR, have set the goal of eradicating the disease by 2030. More information is available at the OIE Peste des Petits Ruminants Portal, http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/ppr-portal/.
