Scrub typhus, a disease caused by the bites of ticks or mites [usually
mites, also called "chiggers"], has claimed 5 lives in Meghalaya [India] in
the past week and affected more than 80 people, particularly in the rural
areas of the state. The medical superintendent of KJP Hospital at Jaiaw in
Shillong, Dr David Tariang, said 5 deaths were reported in the private
hospital and nearly 60 others were undergoing treatment.

The people affected are mostly from the rural areas of West Khasi Hills,
East Khasi Hills, and Ri Bhoi. The disease, prevalent from the month of
November [2009], however, has not spread to the city. When the villagers
venture out to the jungle to collect firewood or for any other farming
activities, the mites or ticks bite them. If they are treated within 2
days, they can be saved. But if there is a delay in reporting the case,
complications start developing, said Tariang. The main factor, which leads
to the death of the patients, is the delay in treatment. Soon after the
bite of the mites or ticks, the patients develop fever. The portions where
the mites or ticks bite initially become reddish and then change into black
spots [eschar].

The drugs used to cure the illness are doxycycline and chloramphenicol
capsules. According to Tariang, the treatment of the disease is cheap and
the people can afford it. The state government, however, has not made
available free medicines to the affected patients. Tariang said the disease
could be fatal since there [are] no proper medical facilities available in
the rural areas to treat it. "The people should report the case to the
nearest health centre or hospital," he said.

There is a need to create awareness among the people in the rural areas to
wear proper clothing before venturing out for farming. As soon as they come
back they should take a bath and wash their clothes he added.

[The following is excerpted from a US CDC report (Demma LJ, McQuiston JH,
Nicholson WL, et al. Scrub typhus, Republic of Palau. Emerg Infect Dis
[serial on the Internet]. 2006 Feb [date cited]. Available from
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no02/05-0967.htm>):

"Scrub typhus is a zoonotic illness caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_. The
pathogen is transmitted through the bite of larval mites (chiggers) of the
_Trombiculidae_ family, which serve as both the vector and the reservoir
(1,2). Rodents of the family _Muridae_ (rats and mice) are common hosts for
trombiculid mites and may support _O. tsutsugamushi_. Geographically
specific foci of scrub typhus are thus determined by the distribution of
vector mites and their rodent hosts and by interactions of mites and
rodents with humans (3). Scrub typhus has been reported from many regions
of Asia and the Pacific islands, and known disease-endemic regions extend
from Japan and eastern Russia southward to Australia and westward to
Pakistan and Afghanistan (4,5).

"Scrub typhus is typically a nonspecific febrile illness; its severity may
be influenced by the strain of _O. tsutsugamushi_, a person's immune
status, and other factors. Diagnosis may be complicated in areas where the
disease has not been documented recently or in regions lacking the capacity
for laboratory confirmation. Illness develops after an incubation period of
6 to 21 days and usually begins with an eschar at the site of a chigger
bite. Fever, headache [lymphadenopathy], and myalgias are common, and a
maculopapular rash may also be present. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or
lower respiratory symptoms can also occur. Manifestations such as
pneumonitis, meningoencephalitis, jaundice, renal failure, and myocarditis
can develop during the prolonged clinical course of untreated illness (6).
Establishing the diagnosis and initiating prompt antimicrobial drug therapy
are important, because death rates for untreated scrub typhus patients are
1-30 per cent (5). Scrub typhus is effectively treated with doxycycline,
and treatment should begin immediately upon suspicion of illness without
awaiting laboratory confirmation."

Rodents may serve as a reservoir, although transovarial transmission in
mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol9no12/03-0212.htm>). Humans become
infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the
chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub
brush or transitional vegetation.

Patients with severe scrub typhus can develop multiorgan failure and
disseminated intravascular coagulopathy with hemorrhage.
