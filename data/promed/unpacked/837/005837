California animal health officials have confirmed another equine case of West Nile virus (WNV). So far this year [2018], there have been 7 confirmed cases of WNV in California horses.

"On [4 Sep 2018], a 16-year-old quarter horse mare with an unknown vaccination status, in Merced county, displaying neurologic signs was confirmed positive for West Nile virus," the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) said in a statement on its website. "Due to the severity of neurologic signs, the mare was euthanized."

The CDFA said the WNV cases were confirmed in Kern, Merced, Placer, Sacramento (2 cases), Shasta, and Stanislaus counties.

"Four horses were unvaccinated, one horse had an unknown vaccine history, and 2 horses were vaccinated," the CDFA said. "Four horses died or were euthanized and 3 horses are alive."

In 2017 there were 21 confirmed cases of WNV in California horses, according to USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service data.

West Nile virus is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Not all infected horses show clinical signs, but those that do can exhibit:
- flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed;
- fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculation (twitching);
- hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound);
- changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they're daydreaming or "just not with it";
- occasional drowsiness;
- propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and
- spinal signs, including asymmetrical weakness; and
- asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia (incoordination).

West Nile has no cure, however some horses can recover with supportive care. Equine mortality rates can reach 30-40 percent.

Studies have shown that vaccines can be effective WNV prevention tools. Horses vaccinated in past years need an annual booster shot, but veterinarians might recommend 2 boosters annually -- one in the spring and another in the fall -- in areas with prolonged mosquito seasons. In contrast, previously unvaccinated horses require a two-shot vaccination series in a 3 to 6 week period. Full immunity takes several weeks to achieve.

In addition to vaccinations, owners should work to reduce mosquito population and breeding areas and limit horses' mosquito exposure by:
- removing stagnant water sources;
- dumping, cleaning, and refilling water buckets and troughs regularly;
- keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times (typically early in the morning and evening); and
- applying mosquito repellents approved for equine use.

The Vermont Department of Health is reminding horse owners to vaccinate their animals for West Nile virus after a horse in Windham county died of the mosquito-borne disease.

The virus is spread to humans and animals by mosquito bites. The disease cannot be transmitted between animals and humans. State Veterinarian Dr Kristin Haas said [Tue 11 Sep 2018] that horse owners need to work with their veterinarians to make sure their animals are appropriately vaccinated.

There have been no reported human cases of West Nile virus in Vermont this year [2018]. The Health Department says most people who are infected do not become sick, but about 20 percent develop flu-like symptoms. In rare cases the illness can be serious, and even fatal.

[There is a very effective vaccine available to protect your animal. It is so much easier and cheaper to prevent the disease than to treat it and hope your animal survives. Many animals do not survive this disease or are euthanized for humane reasons. Even with treatment, the animal may not be able to overcome the disease and then must be euthanized. Why do that? Why not vaccinate and save yourself the heartache and expense of treatment and watching your animal suffer? Just vaccinate your animals, and follow the directions to protect them against mosquitoes. Get rid of mosquito breeding areas and start protecting your equine friend. - Mod.TG
