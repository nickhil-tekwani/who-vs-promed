PRION DISEASE UPDATE 2008 (10)

[With the continuing decline in the number of cases in the human population
of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- abbreviated previously as vCJD or
CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail -- it has been decided to broaden the scope
of the occasional ProMED-mail updates to include other prion-related
diseases. Data on vCJD cases and other forms of CJD: sporadic, iatrogenic,
familial, and GSS (Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease) are included
also when they have some relevance to the incidence and etiology of vCJD. -

The number of suspect cases of vCJD referred to the CJD surveillance unit
in Edinburgh and the number of deaths of definite and probable variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or
vCJD], the form of the disease thought to be linked to BSE (bovine
spongiform encephalopathy) remain unchanged since the previous monthly
report; -- that is, the number of definite or probable vCJD cases (dead and
alive) remains 167.

This situation is consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in the UK
is in decline. The 1st cases were observed in 1995, and the peak number of
deaths was 28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in
2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in 2007, and only one so far in 2008.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the year 2008
--------------------------------------------------
As of 1 Sep 2008 in the UK, so far there have been 88 referrals, 47 deaths
from sporadic CJD, 4 deaths from iatrogenic CJD, 3 from GSS, one from
familial CJD, and one from vCJD.

During the period 1992 to 2008, there were 23 cases of vCJD, all now
deceased. They occurred between 1996 and 2007: one case in 1996, one in
2000, one in 2001, 3 in 2002, none in 2003, 2 in 2004, 6 in 2005, 6 in
2006, 3 in 2007, and none so far in 2008. There were 12 male and 11 female
patients.

Their ages at time of death ranged from 19 to 58 years (mean 39); 6 of the
patients resided in the Ile-de-France [Paris area] and 17 in the provinces.
All the cases were met-met homozygotes for codon 129 of the prion protein
gene. No special risk factors were evident, which distinguished these
patients from those with other forms of CJD (sporadic, genetic,
iatrogenic). However, one patient had visited the UK at regular intervals.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the year 2008
--------------------------------------------------
As of 1 Sep 2008 in France, so far in 2008 there have been 940 referrals,
37 deaths from sporadic CJD, 2 deaths from iatrogenic CJD, 5 from familial
CJD, none from GSS, and none from vCJD.

[3] Prions in urine

Detection of infectious prions in urine

Abstract
--------
Prions are the infectious agents responsible for prion diseases, which
appear to be composed exclusively of the misfolded prion protein (PrP(Sc)).
The mechanism of prion transmission is unknown. In this study, we attempted
to detect prions in urine of experimentally infected animals [hamster].
PrP(Sc) was detected in approximately 80 per cent of the animals studied,
whereas no false positives were observed among the control animals.
Semi-quantitative calculations suggest that PrP(Sc) concentration in urine
is around 10-fold lower than in blood. Interestingly, PrP(Sc) present in
urine maintains its infectious properties. Our data indicate that low
quantities of infectious prions are excreted in the urine. These findings
suggest that urine is a possible source of prion transmission.

The following paragraphs are extracts from the Discussion section of this
paper:

"PrPSc in urine retains infectious properties, since injection of the agent
amplified from this fluid produced a disease indistinguishable from the one
induced by in vivo isolated material. Interestingly, animals [hamsters]
inoculated with PrPSc amplified from the HY strain (both from brain and
urine) showed a similar incubation time as those injected with the same
quantity of PrPSc from sick brain. Our findings suggest that urine is a
possible source of prion transmission. Since urine produced by animals
potentially infected with prions is permanently released and likely
concentrated in environmental samples, such as soil and grass, this route
may prove very relevant for spreading of TSEs [Transmissible Spongiform
Encephalopathies] in wild and captive animals such as cervids, sheep and
cattle. It is known that PrPSc is highly resistant to degradation, and
infectivity can survive in the environment for a long time. Recent studies
have shown that PrPSc adsorbs efficiently into soil, where it remains
infectious, and that both infectivity and PrPSc can stay intact in soil for
long periods. Contamination of soil with urinary prions may contribute to
spreading prion disease among animals, which are known to ingest large
amounts of soil, including cattle, sheep and cervids. Worrisomely, the
continuous excretion of urine and the extremely high resistance of prions
may lead to a progressive accumulation of infectious material in the
environment, with potentially catastrophic consequences in the future.

"One of the top priorities in the prion field is to minimize further
spreading of TSEs to humans or animals by limiting the exposure to
contaminated material. This is a difficult problem, because prion diseases
have a long clinically-silent incubation period in which infected
individuals may unknowingly transmit the disease. In addition, it is
possible that many individuals may remain as sub-clinical carriers during
their entire life, constituting a permanent source of prions. Therefore,
the development and validation of procedures to detect even the tiniest
quantities of infectious material is of paramount importance.
Implementation of a large scale program to screen animals at risk of
infection and diagnosis of the human population requires detection of
prions in easily accessible samples, such as blood or urine. Our results
showing that PrPSc can be detected in urine of a large proportion of
infected animals provide a promising avenue for a sensitive and
non-invasive biochemical diagnosis of prion diseases. Adaptation of PMCA
[protein misfolding cyclic amplification] for detection of prions in urine
of naturally infected animals and humans may offer a great possibility for
routine testing of prion infections."
