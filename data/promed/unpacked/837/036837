Abstract [slightly abridged; for the full text, please refer to the access-free source]

Background
An outbreak of leishmaniosis was studied in cats and dogs housed together with no separation in an animal shelter in Israel.

Methods
The study included recording of clinical signs, serology for _Leishmania_ infection by ELISA, PCR of blood for _Leishmania_ DNA by ITS1 HRM [high resolution melt] and kDNA [kinetoplast minicircle] PCR, parasite quantification, and trapping of sand flies around the shelter.

Results
37% (22/60) of the dogs and 75% (50/67) of the cats were seropositive to _L. infantum_ with a significantly higher [for details, refer to the source URL above] seropositivity rate in the cat population. 25% (15/60) of the dogs were positive for _Leishmania_ by blood PCR, 12% by the _Leishmania_ ITS1 [Internal Transcribed Spacer 1] HRM PCR and 22% by kDNA PCR. Of the cats, 16% (11/67) were positive by kDNA PCR and none by ITS1 HRM PCR. All the PCR-positive animals were infected by _L. infantum_ verified by DNA sequencing and there was no significant difference between the PCR-positivity in the dog and cat populations. Altogether, 43% (26/60) of the dogs and 79% (53/67) of the cats were positive by serology or PCR for _L. infantum_.

The average _Leishmania_ parasite load in the blood of PCR-positive dogs (42 967 parasites/ml) was significantly higher than in PCR-positive cats (1259 parasites/ml). Dogs that were positive by the _Leishmania_ ITS1 HRM PCR and kDNA PCR had significantly higher parasite loads than dogs positive only by the kDNA PCR. No significant effect was found for FIV [feline immunodeficiency virus] seropositivity on _Leishmania_ infection in the cats. A higher percentage of _Leishmania_-positive dogs showed clinical signs compatible with leishmaniosis compared to _Leishmania_-positive cats.

_Phlebotomus perfiliewi_, a proven vector of _L. infantum_, comprised 92% of trapped sand flies.

Conclusions
Comparisons of populations of cats and dogs exposed to sand flies and _L. infantum_ under the same conditions indicated that although a high rate of exposure was detected in cats as manifested by a significantly greater degree of seropositivity, dogs had significantly higher blood parasite loads, and were likely to be more infectious to sand flies than cats.

[Most of past epidemiological surveys on canine and feline leishmaniosis addressed dogs or cats; very few studies related to this infection in both animal species living in the same area, such as refs 1 and 2, from (respectively) Portugal and the Aeolian Islands, Italy.

The study described included dogs and cats that shared a small restricted compound where they mixed freely in the presence of abundant numbers of sand fly vectors. It is reasonable to hypothesize that the dogs and cats living together in the same compound had similar exposure to infectious sand flies. Therefore, this study provided a unique opportunity to compare infection of dogs and cats with _L. infantum_ which was different from previous studies performed in larger and more diverse environments such as metropolitan Lisbon and the Aeolian islands in Italy.

Leishmaniosis is an OIE-listed zoonotic disease. Dogs are commonly affected by _L. infantum_ and _L. chagasi_ (now regarded as synonyms), which causes a chronic viscero-cutaneous disease in this host (canine leishmaniosis, CanL). Asymptomatic infection in dogs is widespread and contributes to maintaining the long-term presence of the parasite in endemic regions. The clinical appearance and evolution of leishmaniosis is a consequence of complex interactions between the parasite and host immune response. The outcome of infection depends on the ability of host macrophages to effectively destroy the parasite. The above and additional information on the disease in animals, in particular its diagnosis, is available at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.01.11_LEISHMANIOSIS.pdf.
