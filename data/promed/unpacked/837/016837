Smithfield Foods, Inc today [8 Aug 2007] confirmed outbreaks of classical
swine fever (CSF) at 2 of its hog farms in Romania. Quarantine measures
have been imposed on these farms. The results of CSF tests on animals at
the company's other farms in Romania have thus far been negative.

The company is working closely with national and local governmental
authorities in Romania to contain the outbreaks. About 39 000 animals at
the 2 farms will be destroyed and disposed of under the direction of
Romanian governmental authorities. The company estimates that inventory
write down and disposal costs associated with the outbreaks will negatively
impact fiscal 2nd quarter operating results by USD 4-5 million.

CSF is a highly contagious viral disease affecting pigs, which is endemic
to Romania and the company has been working with the government to
eradicate it. The company emphasized that CSF does not affect humans and
therefore poses no threat to human health or food safety.

With sales of USD 12 billion, Smithfield is the leading processor and
marketer of fresh pork and processed meats in the United States, as well as
the largest producer of hogs.

[CSF is, reportedly, active in Romania's neighbour countries Hungary and
Bulgaria. During 2007, Hungary has sent to the World Organization for
Animal Health (Office International des Epizooties; OIE) an immediate
report on 24 Jan 2007 and 11 follow-up reports since, the most recent on 9
Aug 2007. Bulgaria has sent 3 reports: an immediate report on 8 Feb 2007
and follow-up reports on 10 Mar 2007 and 4 Aug 2007. To view said reports,

Romania's report, providing laboratory test results and epidemiological
data, is anticipated. - Mod.AS]
