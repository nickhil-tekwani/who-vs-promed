Avian botulism has killed at least 10 ducks in the past week near 2
area ponds and landed 5 others in the Ohio Wildlife Center.

The center, which specializes in wildlife rehabilitation and
education, is asking for donations of Pedialyte to rehydrate the sick ducks.

Ducks contract avian botulism by eating bacteria in soil that turns
toxic in a warm environment with a protein source, said Anne
Ballmann, wildlife-disease specialist with the U.S. Geological Survey.

She said ducks become "intoxicated" and paralyzed when exposed to the
toxin through water that has low oxygen levels or by eating as few as
5 toxin-ridden maggots. Experts recommend proper disposal of duck
carcasses to prevent spread of the disease.

Algae blooms can lower oxygen levels in ponds where ducks congregate.

Hundreds of thousands of waterfowl die annually in July and August
from Type C botulism, but Ballman said it occurs more often in
California and other Western states, where there are bigger flocks.

Type C botulism is not contagious and rarely infects humans, who more
commonly contract Type A or C botulism from improperly processed canned goods.

One sick duck was brought to the Ohio Wildlife Center Hospital from
the Franklin Park Conservatory on the East Side last weekend. Four
others came from Charleston Apartments at 5407 Edwards Plantation
Dr., which has a small, man-made pond on its grounds on the Northwest Side.

Delaware resident Lisa Avery said she visited the apartment complex
pond 3 nights in a row this week after she heard about the ducks
while volunteering at the animal hospital. She left with a sick duck
each day and picked up one dead duck.

"It's hard not to feel sorry for a duck that can't even stand up," Avery said.

Affected mallard ducks have "rubber necks" and difficulty swimming,
walking and breathing, said Barbara Ray, the Ohio Wildlife Center's
conservation-education director. She guessed a few rain-free days
would end the problem by stopping runoff of infected soil into the water.

Residents who see sick or dead ducks should call the Ohio Wildlife
Center hot line at 614-793-9453.
