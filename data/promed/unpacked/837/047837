[Roberto Barrera, head of the Laboratory of Vector Biology of the
Institute of Tropical Zoology, Universidad Central de Venezuela,
explained that the pesticide commonly used for control of dengue fever
is effective only for a few days because _Aedes aegypti_, the vector
for the infection, may repopulate an area in just one week. Therefore,
it is necessary to implement measures aimed at the elimination of
mosquito eggs. - Mod.JT
During the rainy season, government agencies at all levels have made a
great effort to try to eliminate the mosquito that transmits dengue
fever. However, it seems that such effort has not been entirely
adequate. Barrera explained that although there are epidemics every
year, epidemiological surveys carried out at the Institute and based
on the city of Maracay, showed that the number of affected persons in
the country increases every 3 years. This has been a peak year, and
next year should be one with low incidence of the disease. Similarly,
studies have shown that pre-schoolers and school-aged children are the
most affected because they are the most exposed, given that, among
other reasons, they sleep without bednets or take naps during the day,
when _Aedes aegypti_ is active.
In addition, it is difficult to attain full protection through
insecticides alone because the mosquito is present in the home;
fumigation is usually done outside, and not in all zones
simultaneously, which leaves areas untreated. Barrera emphasized that
better communication, organization, and participation by the community
are necessary. It is not enough to fumigate. It is necessary to remove
the eggs, larvae, and breeding sites in order to control the disease.
According to Barrera, one of the reasons that the vector thrives in
cities like Caracas is that there is water all year round, which
allows it to breed constantly. The mosquito adapts to drought
conditions; its eggs can survive without water for 3 to 6 months and
not evolve into other stages. However, in urban areas, where water is
available during the entire year, mosquitoes also breed during the dry
season and in sufficient numbers to sustain the transmission of dengue
fever, as well as the accumulation of the different types of the
disease -- currently there are 4 serotypes circulating.
The research carried out by the university in Ma racay showed that the
problem exists in only 50 of the 400 districts in the area, and it is
there where the efforts must be concentrated. These communities have
in common high population density, inadequate water storage and solid
waste [potential larval breeding sites collection, and mobility of
the population. There is less migration and less dengue fever in rural
towns.
In Barrera's judgment, the dengue fever epidemic demonstrates
deficiencies in control services. The problem lies in the fact that
after the eradication of malaria in the 60s, epidemiological systems
and vector control programs were dismantled. The only way to control
the epidemic is to create special units that include physicians,
biologists, ecologists, and experts in vector ecology who can take
action. Such units do not exist in Venezuela.

[In fact, you donÂ´t really need all that -- you just need a proper
system for disposal of solid waste (including discarded automobile
tires, prime breeding sites), and a community willing to eliminate
water from all small containers in and around their houses. - Mod.JW
