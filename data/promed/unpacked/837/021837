Swine flu infects children 14 times more than elderly
-----------------------------------------------------
Children were 14 times more likely to be sickened by swine flu than adults
60 and older, the age group that is typically the most at risk for
influenza, according to a US study of the disease. Children ages 5 to 14
became ill with swine flu, also known as influenza pandemic H1N1 2009
virus, at a rate of 147 per 100 000 people, according to the study of 1557
confirmed illnesses, including 7 deaths, in Chicago from April to July
[2009], months when the flu virus usually doesn't spread. The findings were
reported today [27 Aug 2009] by the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta [see: MMWR 2009; 58(33): 913-8, Aug 28.

-- July 2009

US health officials are planning a vaccination campaign that will focus on
those who are disproportionately affected by H1N1, which include children,
pregnant women, and adults with underlying health conditions. A separate
study released today from New Zealand [see ProMED-mail: Influenza pandemic
(H1N1) 2009 (35): NZ surveillance 20090827.3022] showed swine flu targeted
younger people and dominated other virus strains after circulating for just
one month during the winter, when [seasonal] influenza is more active.
"Like other Southern Hemisphere countries with temperate climates, New
Zealand entered its winter season with co-circulation of both seasonal and
2009 pandemic influenza strains," said the authors of a report, published
in CDC's MMWR [see: MMWR 2009; 58(33): 918-21, 28 Aug. Surveillance for
the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus and seasonal influenza viruses
-- New Zealand, 2009
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5833a2.htm?s_cid=mm5833a2_e>].
"The number of viruses identified as 2009 pandemic influenza rapidly
overtook the number identified as seasonal influenza."

In New Zealand, the number of patients with flu symptoms who sought medical
attention was 1518 doctor visits for every 100 000 people from 3 May 2009
to 2 Aug 2009, according to the report. The highest concentration of cases
occurred in South Auckland, where people went to the doctor with flu
symptoms at a rate of 1308 per 100 000 in a single week, from 6 Jul to 12
Jul 2009. A weekly rate of 100 to 149 at that time is considered "moderate"
while rates of more than 400 indicate an epidemic, according to the report.
Data for the study was provided by New Zealand's Ministry of Health, as
well as doctors and nurses involved in the country's flu surveillance system.
