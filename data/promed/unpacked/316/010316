Navajo health officials on Wednesday were cited as reporting the first
death on the Navajo Indian Reservation in four years blamed on hantavirus.
The victim was identified as a 23-year-old man from San Juan County in
northwestern New Mexico.
This case, and a reported hantavirus fatality in Cordado two weeks ago, has
spurred tribal officials to put out notices warning tribal members of the
possibility of another outbreak.
In 1993, six Navajos died and several others had to undergo treatment for
the disease when the first major breakout occurred in the United States.
Officials for the New Mexico Department of Health were cited as saying that
statewide tests have found deer mice testing positive for hantavirus in
nearly every area.
