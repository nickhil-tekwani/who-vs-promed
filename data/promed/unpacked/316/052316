[The main take away message in this week's Global Polio Eradication Initiative update is that the WPV1 is still circulating in both Afghanistan and Pakistan.

In Afghanistan there is the report of the newly confirmed case of WPV1 associated paralytic disease in an 11-month-old child from Shawalikot district in Kandahar province with date of onset of illness on 17 Oct 2017. This brings the total number of cases of WPV1 associated disease in Afghanistan for 2017 to 10. In addition, there was an isolate of a WPV1 from environmental sampling in Kandahar district of Kandahar province from 5 Oct 2017.

In Pakistan, there were 6 isolates of WPV1 - 1 was collected in Punjab province, Rawalpindi district on 10 Oct 2017; 2 were collected in Sindh province, 1 from Karachi Giqbal district on 10 Oct 2017, and 1 from Karachi Orangi district on 16 Oct 2017; 3 were collected in Balochistan province, 1 from Quetta district on 12 Oct 2017, 1 from Killa Abdullah district on 15 Oct 2017, and 1 from Loralai district on 17 Oct 2017. As the most recent confirmed case in Pakistan occurred in Lakki Marwat district, Khyber Pakhtoon province with a date of onset of paralysis on 21 Aug 2017, the continued isolation of the WPV1 in environmental samples from other provinces (Sindh, Balochistan and Punjab) indicates continued circulation of the WPV1 in Pakistan. See ProMED-mail post Poliomyelitis update (27): global (Pakistan, Afghanistan), Syria 20170928.5347795 for additional details.

As for the cVDPV2 outbreaks in Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, neither location reported newly confirmed cases in the past week (see below for more discussion on the outbreak in Syria).

Key highlights
- No new cases of cVDPV2 were reported this week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases remains 63. All confirmed cases to date have had onset of paralysis before [25 Aug 2017].
- IPV activities aimed at reaching children aged 2-23 months are ongoing. IPV will be offered alongside bOPV as part of the Sub-National Immunization Days (SNIDs) in 6 districts of Damascus and 200 hotels in the city, 3 areas of Rural Damascus, 2 districts of Homs and 1 district of Aleppo with large IDP populations from Deir Ez-Zor.
- Almost 3000 children under 5 have received all routine immunization antigens in newly accessible areas of Deir Ez-Zor city between [7-10 Nov 2017] in opportunistic vaccination activities.
- A joint mission between the World Health Organization and the local Health Authority to visit newly accessible areas of Aleppo was conducted this week. The mission also met with the Aleppo University Hospital and Aleppo Pediatric Association to advocate for AFP surveillance and to support ongoing immunization activities to reach IDPs from infected areas.
- The Advisory Group on mOPV2 vaccine provision met this week to review the revised risk assessment for Syria cVDPV2 outbreak and discuss contingency plans for outbreak response. The group endorsed, in principle, the proposal to preposition approximately 1 million doses mOPV2 in Damascus (pending receipt of formal vaccine request from the Ministry of Health) to enable rapid response in the event of any ongoing outbreak response activities.

Immunization response
- Since the beginning of the cVDPV2 outbreak in Syria, 2 outbreak response rounds utilizing mOPV2 have been completed in both Deir Ez-Zor ([22-27 Jul 2017 and 22-28 Aug 2017]) and Raqqa (12-18 Aug 2017 and 7-13 Oct 2017]) governorates.
- In addition to focused mOPV2 campaigns, a single dose of IPV has been offered to children 2-23 months in all districts of Deir Ez-Zor and Raqqa, except Tell Abyad district, Raqqa. Additional IPV immunization activities to boost the immunity of children aged between 2-23 months have been carried out in high risk areas of Aleppo, Idlib and Hama governorates.

Additional risk mitigation strategies
- IPV will be offered to children aged 2-23 months in 6 districts of Damascus and 200 hotels in the city, 3 areas of Rural Damascus, 2 district of Homs and 1 district of Aleppo in the upcoming Sub-National Immunization Days (SNIDs) targeting children under 5 with bOPV. The campaign is planned to begin on [19 Nov 2017].
- Communication plans for the areas included in the bOPV/IPV SNIDs are being developed and strengthened to ensure high awareness among caregivers of the upcoming campaigns.
- Almost 3000 children under 5 have received all routine immunization antigens in newly accessible areas of Deir Ez-Zor city between [7-10 Nov 2017] and 9491 children aged 2-23 months were vaccinated with IPV in 34 high risk villages in Deir EzZor governorate during the 1st week of October [2017] in opportunistic vaccination activities.
- Routine Immunization services are being restored and opened in some districts of Raqqa and Aleppo governorates; 14 health facilities offering routine immunization have been re-activated in Raqqa and Thawra districts, Raqqa and 79 centers were activated in Aleppo governorate out of total 237.
- An 80 person training on the assessment of cold chain will be conducted in November [2017] in Damascus. Assessment of cold chain of all health facilities in all accessible governorates is planned for early December [2017].
- A joint mission between the World Health Organization and the local Health Authority to visit newly accessible areas of Aleppo was conducted this week. The mission also met with the Aleppo University Hospital and Aleppo Pediatric Association to advocate for enhanced AFP surveillance and to support ongoing immunization activities to reach IDPs from the outbreak zone.

Regional response
- Outbreak response teams continue to contingency plan for potential breakthrough cases in known outbreak zones or spread of virus to new areas of the country. The plans aim to ensure that the programme is able to respond as quickly as possible if any further transmission of poliovirus is detected in Syria.

Surveillance summary
- In 2017, Syria and all governorates but four, are meeting both key indicators for AFP surveillance: 3* or more non-polio AFP cases per 100,000 children below 15 years of age, and 80 percent or above AFP cases with adequate specimens. Deir Ez-Zor (76 percent), Raqqa (74 percent), Rural Damascus (74 percent) and Swieda (63 percent) are missing the 80 percent target for stool adequacy. (*NB: In an outbreak setting, the target is 3 or more non-polio AFP cases per 100 000 children below 15 years).
- Work continues to support the upgrade of laboratory facilities, expansion of environmental surveillance and training of laboratory and field staff. WHO has provided the equipment and renovations are ongoing to enable the room for receiving specimens to be ready in the next week. Training for Lab staff will be conducted in early December [2017] to enable full implementation of new processes before the end of 2017.
- Orientation sessions to inform local NGO partners and private sector of the ongoing outbreak response efforts continues in Dara, Qunietra, Sweida governorates and in areas of Rural Damascus and Damascus. As part of these efforts, the Aleppo Pediatric Association is involved in media activities to promote upcoming vaccination activities and the importance of immunization.
- Supplementary surveillance strategies, including taking stool samples from healthy children, continues to further strengthen surveillance sensitivity across the country. Since the start of the outbreak 228 healthy children samples have been processed by the lab. Of the total number of healthy children sampled 177 have returned negative and 31 are pending in the lab.
- The total number of AFP cases detected in Deir Ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 149 (111 from Mayadeen, 11 from Deir Ez-Zor, and 27 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 21 AFP cases (9 from Raqqa, 10 from Tell Abyad, and 2 from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 42 AFP cases (21 from Homs city, 18 from Rastan, 1 from Tadmour and 2 from Talkalakh districts).
- 14 polio-virus type-2 isolates are currently pending genomic sequencing (1 from Menibij, Aleppo district, Aleppo governorate; 4 from Boukamal district, 9 from Mayadeen district, Deir Ez-Zor governorate).

[While there are no newly confirmed cases of cVDPV2 in Syria during the past week, the above update mentions there are 14 poliovirus type 2 isolated pending genomic sequencing in Syria at this present time -- 1 from Aleppo district in Aleppo governorate and the remainder from Dir Ez-Zor governorate (4 from Boukamal district and 9 from Mayadeen district). Hence, it is highly likely that all 14 are cVDPV2's and not WPV2. We do not have the dates of onset of these cases to know how "old" they may be in the course of this outbreak to know if transmission may have been interrupted by the vaccination activities nor do we know details of the cases to know if the case in Aleppo is in a displace person coming from Dir Ez-Zor or elsewhere or if the case is indicative of circulation in Aleppo district/Aleppo governorate.

A map showing the locations of cases reported in Syria can be found at the source URL. In addition, the original report has epidemic curves of this outbreak. - Mod.MPP]
