The University of Chicago [UC] has suspended research in a lab after a
scientist developed a skin infection from the same kind of bacteria
being studied there.

The scientist was hospitalized late last month [August 2011] and had
surgery to remove the infected tissue but has been released.

The incident happened 2 years after another UC scientist studying a
weakened strain of plague contracted the disease and died. The
university says the cases are drastically different.

The new case involves a germ called _Bacillus cereus_ that can cause
food poisoning. The university says it isn't clear how the scientist
got infected, but it has been disinfecting the lab as a precaution,
and has contacted public health authorities.

No one else has gotten sick.

[_Bacillus cereus_ is a common cause of diarrhea, especially in South
East Asia. That this person developed a skin lesion suggests that it
wasn't your cousin's _B. cereus_ but the strain with plasmids that is
associated with sick Texas oil pipe welders. How this laboratory
scientist got a skin infection raises questions about UC laboratory
protocols and routine use of plastic gloves, and awareness of specific
risks such that medical aid was sought at a relatively late stage --
the doctors believed it necessary to excise "the infected tissue."

Laboratory infections with pathogens under study are not rare,
unfortunately. The most dangerous in this regard are the brucellae.
During the heyday of anthrax research in the 1940s and '50s at Fort
Detrick, Maryland, there were a number infected. It s not unknown
elsewhere.

It would seem that this _B. cereus_ cutaneous infection mimicked a _B.
anthracis_ infection as it persuaded the UC medics to excise it. This
is unnecessary. Actively drain the lesion and in due course the
inflammation will go down leaving nary a sign.

However, members are encouraged to read the report [see ProMED-mail
archive no. 20051209.3546] on the epidemic of scalp infections in
military cadets in Georgia, USA. These all cleared up within 48 hours
of starting antibiotic treatment. A comment in regard to such
infections is that the individual involved might have an immunity
deficiency. If so, in this case it would go towards explaining the
severity of the lesion. - Mod.MHJ]
