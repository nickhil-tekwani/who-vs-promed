A foot-and-mouth (FMD) disease outbreak was reported in Cuatro Canadas,
Department of Santa Cruz, which [had been] considered an FMD-free area with
vaccination by the OIE. Some reports indicate that the infected herd has
34 head of cattle and that 4 calves showed FMD-like clinical signs.
However, other sources report that the affected herd has only 10 cattle.
Herds in Cuatro Canadas and Pailon have been quarantined. Bolivia has
suspended exports to Venezuela, Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador, and Paraguay
has declared a sanitary alert along the border with Bolivia.
Bolivian farmers reacted to the news of an outbreak of foot-and-mouth
disease (FMD) in Cuatro Canadas municipality with surprise, since this
leads to an immediate halt of their 2 main current activities. The 1st is
the exportation of meat and dairy products to Andean markets in Colombia,
Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. The 2nd is submission of the document
portfolio supporting the contention that Bolivia did not have any FMD
outbreaks during the past 3.5 years, which made this country a strong
candidate for petitioning to the Epizootic International Organization to be
declared an area free of FMD with vaccination.
Since last Thursday, the initial report from technicians from the National
Service for Agricultural and Food Safety (SENASAG, according to its Spanish
initials) has been reassessed by laboratory testing, and last Friday, at
17:00, the National head for Animal sanitation, Mr. Ernesto Salas, issued a
national alert for all Bolivian farmers with respect to this current outbreak.
The following report was received by chief farmers in Santa Cruz
Department, Bolivia Farmers Union (CONGABOL, according to its Spanish
initials) and the Local Prefecture, in an emergency meeting held yesterday
afternoon: "Regrettably, all authorizations for exporting meat and dairy
product to the Andean Community markets are automatically suspended. This
measure is being implemented because of sanitary safety, and we will start
coordinating actions with sanitary institutions in neighboring countries
and with the international community so that controls are complied with in
Bolivia and the spread of the outbreak will be avoided," Mr. Salas said.
Mr. Salas also pointed out that a national emergency status has been
declared, that Pailon and Cuatro Canadas municipalities had quarantine
declared, and the displacement of animals has been stopped until the FMD
outbreak is solved [ended?].
The sanitary authority declared that the property where the outbreak was
detected belongs to Mennonite farmers located in Nueva Esperanza Colony,
Field No. 211, 11 kilometers from Cuatro Canadas, where there is a
permanent team comprising 5 technicians from SENASAG. It was also stated
that there are 34 cattle in the farm, and 4 calves are infected.
Mr. George Prestel, CONGABOL's Chairman, regretted that all the effort
towards animal sanitation carried out over the years had been wasted,
together with all investments made, which were estimated at 30 million U.S.
dollars. He also confirmed that a state of emergency has been declared, and
that a letter has already been issued to the Rural and Agricultural
Development Ministry requesting that a Supreme decree be issued allocating
resources to eradicate the outbreak as soon as possible.
"This is the main issue. Along with financial support, the Government must
also fight labor uncertainty in SENASAG, since its officers do not know
whether they will retain their jobs or not," he added.
Mr. Prestel also pointed out that there will be an enormous impact on
exports, since the sale of Bolivian meat products to foreign countries
represents around 10 million U.S. Dollars.
Both Mr. Prestel and Mr. Salas pointed out that it will take at least 6
months to determine the causes of the outbreak and to eradicate it in
Cuatro Canadas. "If necessary, animals will be culled," warned Mr. Salas.
On the other hand, Mr. Miguel Guzman, Head of the Agricultural Departmental
Service, stated that Santa Cruz Prefecture will immediately provide
financial support. "We will make every effort to recover our Department's
status of area free from FMD with vaccination", he emphasized.
Paraguayan sanitary authorities already decreed a sanitary alert in the
Chaco area, which borders Bolivia.
Foot-and-mouth disease is a highly contagious disease that affects both
wild and domestic ungulate mammals (cattle, sheep, goats, camels, and
pigs). It is caused by a virus belonging to the Picornaviridae family.
The most common transmission route is through aerosol inhalation (saliva or
mucus droplets, as it is the case for sneezing) when healthy animals are in
contact with sick animals. The disease can be transmitted to different
areas through contaminated equipment, material, persons and insects, as
well as through contaminated products and by-products.
The most common symptoms of the disease include lack of appetite and
excessive drooling because of sores in the mouth, gums, and tongue. Animals
are also unable to walk because of extensive blister formation on their
hooves and nipples.
Paraguayan authorities decreed a sanitary alert in the western region of
the country, also called the Paraguayan Chaco, which borders Bolivia,
because of the detection of possible cases of foot-and-mouth disease in the
neighboring country.
Mr. Hugo Corrales, Executive Director of the National Service for Animal
Control and health (SENACSA, according to its Spanish initials), told EFE
news service that his institution decreed the state of alert in Infante
Rivarola community (Chaco), 700 kilometers northeast of Asuncion, because
of signs of a probable outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in Santa
Cruz de la Sierra, an important Bolivian city.
"It is a reasonable suspicion. This can be confirmed or ruled out in a few
hours, but regardless, we ordered the implementation of a sanitary control
barrier in Infante Rivarola community, which is 300 kilometers away from
Santa Cruz de la Sierra", explained Mr. Corrales.
The officer declared that the national veterinary service is currently
continuing with the FMD vaccination campaign in order to have complete
coverage for 10 million cattle. The campaign started on 15 Jan 2007, and it
is expected to end on 15 Feb.
Paraguay maintains its certification of a country free of FMD with
vaccination, which allowed it to export meat products for nearly 400
million U.S. Dollars in 2006, according to official figures.

Ten cattle on a farm belonging to a Mennonite individual in Cuatro Canadas
municipality, field No. 211, were reported to have foot-and-mouth disease
(FMD), constituting an outbreak. There are 4 additional animals under
observation, and this generated an alert for animal breeders. The local
union of cattle farmers immediately reported this occurrence to the
National Council for Foot-and-Mouth Disease Eradication and the Santa Cruz
Prefecture, in order to control the outbreak and take measures in order not
to harm the process of certification at the International Epizootic
Organization (OIE, according to its Spanish initials), since Bolivia
intends to widen its meat and dairy product exporting business.
Mr. George Prestel, head of FEGASACRUZ (Santa Cruz Farmers Union), stated
yesterday morning that they met with representatives of the National
Commission and Prefecture, in order to request the Ministry of Agriculture
issue an Urgency Decree in order to get financial resources for a
vaccination campaign against the disease, which is affecting local farmers.
In addition to looking for responsible persons, Mr. Prestel explained that
first of all an exhaustive analysis will be performed in order to determine
the origin of the reemergence of FMD in that particular farm, and later to
control this focus, so that responsibility for the outbreak can be determined.
"The outbreak was confirmed by laboratory tests, and samples have been sent
to PANAFTOSA (WHO/PAHO PanAmerican Center for FMD) for certification", said
Mr. Prestel, and he pointed out that there are 4 more cattle under
observation, in addition to the animals that might have come into contact
with affected cattle.
An officer from the National Service for Agricultural Sanitation and Food
Safety (SENSAG, according to its Spanish initials) said that this
reemergent outbreak will lead to economic loss, "so we have to act as soon
as possible so that the harmful effects are minimized." He also said that
as a preventive measure to halt disease spread in cattle, a ban was
implemented in field No. 211 in Cuatro Canadas municipality and the
surrounding areas, where no movement of animals will be allowed, and every
animal movement in Cuatro Canadas and Pailon municipalities will be
controlled by SENASAG.
Some other additional measures will also be implemented, depending on the
results of tests to be performed in the next few days, "in order to
determine the true origin of this FMD outbreak and to identify the animals
that had been in contact with affected cattle".
Mr. Prestel emphasized that technical analyses will be performed in order
to determine the origin of this outbreak, so that the occurrence can be
controlled in order to minimize losses, and "naturally, discussions will be
held to determine responsibility." He also pointed out that for 2 years
they have been demanding that SENASAG personnel be kept in their jobs,
since the continuous change in such personnel affected the safety of
vaccination campaigns performed since 2001.
Paraguay decreed a sanitary alert last Saturday because of the said FMD
outbreak in a farm in Santa Cruz de la Sierra Province in Bolivia.
Mr. Hugo Corrales, head of the Animal health Service, declared to the press
that "4 calves have FMD in a farm located 370 kilometers from the
Paraguayan Chaco border".
The border with Santa Cruz (Bolivia) is 900 kilometers west of Asuncion,
the Capital City of Paraguay.
"This alert means that no Bolivian cattle should enter Paraguay, since this
latter country is free of FMD because of vaccination", he pointed out.
"We hope that Bolivian sanitary authorities have taken preventive measures
to stop spread of the disease and that they reported this to MERCOSUR
(South American Economic Community)", said Mr. Corrales.
In 2006, Paraguay sold 450 million U.S. dollars worth of meat products to
the U.S., Chile, Europe, Russia, and Asia. The local markets even ran out
of stock, so that supermarket owners had to import meat products in order
to satisfy the local demand.
