The 1st detection of _Citrus yellow vein clearing virus_ (CYVCV) has been made during the California Department of Food and Agriculture's (CDFA) routine multi-pest survey. The US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed positive identifications.

CDFA is now surveying residential and commercial properties in the area to fully determine the extent of the presence of CYVCV which is currently believed to be limited. The results will provide information for the regulatory approach taken by CDFA and APHIS.

[_Citrus yellow vein clearing virus_ (CYVCV; subgenus _Mandarivirus_ of genus _Potexvirus_) was characterised in 2012 (see link below). Previously, it had been reported only in some Asian countries and the Mediterranean region of Turkey. Symptoms may include vein yellowing and/or clearing, leaf distortion, ringspots, veinal necrosis, and reduction of yield and quality of fruits, depending on citrus species or hybrid. CYVCV is related to, but serologically distinct from _Indian citrus ringspot virus_ (ICRSV; see ProMED post 20111216.3609).

CYVCV can be transmitted by insect vectors (aphid and whitefly species), mechanical means, contaminated equipment, grafting, infected propagation material, or rootstocks. Disease management may include vector control, phytosanitary measures, and use of certified clean propagation material. For detecting ICRSV infected plants, indexing methods based on herbaceous indicator species have been developed and a similar approach may be worth exploring for CYVCV.
