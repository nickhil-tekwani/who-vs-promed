Bali deaths list update
----------------------------
I have just received updated information from Levin Kalalo of the
Bali Animal Welfare Association about human rabies deaths since the
present outbreak was identified in mid-2008.

There have now been 27 human deaths in total. All of those previously
listed as actual or suspected are now confirmed as rabies deaths. The
ages of several of the victims have been corrected.

A 32-year-old man, originally of Flores [Island], and only recently
arrived in Bali, appears to have been the 1st victim to be bitten, in
July 2008. He was apparently bitten by a dog brought from Flores and
died on 17 Jan 2009. However, 5 other people had died before his
death.

Levin Kalalo's table listed the victims by regency. I am continuing
to list them by community, where possible, to provide more specific
information about where rabies has occurred and where it is moving.
[The names of the victims have been removed in the interests of
patient confidentiality].

[The number of human rabies deaths has increased to the 27 listed
above from the 24 confirmed (and one suspected) cases listed on 17
Dec 2009. So far all the those affected have been local Bali
inhabitants, but tourists and other visitors to the island should be
forewarned of the risk and take precautions accordingly.

Flores and Bali, both part of the Lesser Sunda Islands can be located
