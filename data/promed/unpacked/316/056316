Fusarium Keratitis -- Multiple States, 2006
-----------------------------------------------
On 8 Mar 2006, CDC received a report from an ophthalmologist in New
Jersey regarding 3 patients with contact lens-associated Fusarium
keratitis during the preceding 3 months. Initial contact with several
corneal disease specialty centers in the United States revealed that
other centers also have seen recent increases in Fusarium keratitis.
This report summarizes the public health response to date in the
United States and provides important prevention messages for contact
lens users.
Microbial keratitis is a severe infection of the cornea. Risk factors
for infection include trauma (generally with plant material), chronic
ocular surface diseases, immunodeficiencies, and rarely, contact lens
use (1-3). An estimated 30 million persons in the United States wear
soft contact lenses; the annual incidence of microbial keratitis is
estimated to be 4-21 per 10 000 soft contact lens users, depending on
whether users wear lenses overnight (4). Fungal keratitis is a
condition more prevalent in warm climates; in the southernmost United
States, up to 35 percent of microbial keratitis cases are fungal
keratitis, compared with one percent in New York (5,6). The
proportion of fungal keratitis attributable to _Fusarium spp._ also
varies by region, from 25 percent to 62 percent (1,2,5). First line
treatment includes topical and oral antifungal medications; patients
who do not respond to medical treatment usually require surgical
intervention, including corneal transplantation (3). Fusarium
keratitis is not transmitted from person to person.
As of 9 Apr 2006, a total of 109 patients with suspected Fusarium
keratitis were under investigation in multiple states. Case finding
was conducted through postings on the Epidemic Information Exchange
(Epi-X) and ophthalmology listserves and through queries of clinical
microbiology laboratories. CDC is coordinating an investigation with
public health authorities in California, Connecticut, Florida,
Georgia, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New
Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas,
and Vermont. The majority of patients have yet to be interviewed;
however, of 30 patients for whom complete data were available, the
median age was 48 years (range: 13-83 years), and 21 (70 percent)
were female; infection onset occurred during 15 Jun 2005 - 18 Mar
2006.
28 patients (93 percent) wore soft contact lenses, and 2 (7 percent)
reported no contact lens use. Among contact lens users, 26 (93
percent) remembered which solution they used during the month before
infection onset or had retained the actual bottle. Of these, 26 (100
percent) reported using a Bausch & Lomb (Rochester, New York) ReNu
brand contact lens solution or a generic-brand solution manufactured
by Bausch & Lomb. Patients reported using various ReNu product types
from multiple product lots. Five (18 percent) patients reported using
other solutions in addition to the ReNu solution, including solutions
made by Advanced Medical Optics, Inc. (Santa Ana, California) and
Alcon (Fort Worth, Texas). Nine (32 percent) patients reported
wearing contact lenses overnight, a known risk factor for microbial
keratitis. Eight (29 percent) required corneal transplantation.
Laboratory testing to evaluate product contamination, including
typing of _Fusarium spp._ isolates, is ongoing.
Clusters of Fusarium keratitis were reported among contact lens users
in Asia beginning in February 2006. At that time, Bausch & Lomb
voluntarily suspended sales of its ReNu multi-purpose solutions in
Singapore and Hong Kong, pending investigation, after multiple
reports of Fusarium keratitis among contact lens users there (7).
An ongoing investigation by CDC, state and local health departments,
and the Food and Drug Administration is under way to determine
whether this cluster represents an increase of Fusarium keratitis
infections and to determine the association, if any, of these cases
with any product. Epidemiologic and laboratory studies will help
define specific activities, hygiene practices, or products that place
persons at increased risk for Fusarium keratitis.
Measures to reduce the risk for microbial keratitis can be instituted
immediately by contact lens users and include the safe handling,
storage, and cleaning of contact lenses. Specifically, contact lens
users should wash their hands with soap and water and dry them before
handling lenses, wear lenses according to the schedule prescribed by
eye-care practitioners and solution manufacturers, and follow
guidelines for cleaning and storing lenses provided by eye-care
practitioners and solution manufacturers. Contact lens users with
questions about which solutions are best for them should consult
their eye-care professionals and carefully weigh risks and benefits.
Clinicians evaluating contact lens users with signs or symptoms of
keratitis, such as unusual redness, eye pain, tearing, discharge, or
sensitivity to light, should consider fungal keratitis and refer the
patient to an ophthalmologist, if appropriate. Clinicians should
consider obtaining clinical specimens (e.g., corneal scrapings) for
culture before initiating treatment. Clinicians or microbiology
laboratories should report cases of Fusarium keratitis to state and
local health departments or directly to CDC at telephone
800-893-0485. _Fusarium_ isolates should be submitted to state
laboratories according to instructions provided by local and state
public health laboratories.

[ProMED-mail has covered the initial clustering of fusarium keratitis
cases in Singapore and the initial reports of increased cases in the
USA as well as the mention of cases in Malaysia and Hong Kong. As
mentioned above, there was a voluntary recall of the above mentioned
contact lens solution in Singapore. In the above report, while it
appears as though the same contact lens solution recalled in
Singapore was used by "all cases," it should be highlighted that this
refers to all cases on whom information on type of contact lens
solution used was known (of 109 suspected cases, information on
contact lens solution use was available from 26 (24 percent of
cases), a number too low to draw conclusions at this time. That being
said, the history of implication of a single product in Singapore,
and the preliminary findings of the same product being used by cases
in the USA does lead one to wonder whether that product is involved.
It would be interesting to hear whether other countries have been
observing a similar increase in fusarium keratitis associated with
contact lens use. In the prior ProMED-mail posting (Fusarium
keratitis - Asia, USA: RFI 20060330.0968), this moderator discussed
the different types of soft contact lenses that were available, and
one also still wonders whether there might be a higher association of
fusarium keratitis with a specific type of contact lens used. -
