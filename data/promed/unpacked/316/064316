An invasive species of mosquito that is not native to Ventura County has been recorded in Ojai. An _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito was located in Ojai after health officials began investigating reports of mosquitoes biting during the day.

The Ventura County Environmental Health Division said this species of mosquito is aggressive and bites during the day. It's also capable of transmitting several viruses that can cause serious diseases such as Zika, dengue, and yellow fever.

There have not been any documented transmission of these diseases in California to date, but the potential still exists, the environmental health division said. Native mosquitoes are capable of transmitting West Nile and other viruses.

Since September 2020, the invasive _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito has been detected in Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks, Westlake Village, Fillmore, Ventura and Oxnard.

Mosquitoes lay their eggs in standing water, so residents are urged to check their property for any standing water and empty it out. Common places for standing water include birdbaths and fountains, yard drains, discarded tires and pet water dishes. Stored water should also be covered with tight lids or fine mesh screens.

People can avoid the risk of being bit by native and non-native mosquitoes by wearing properly fitted clothing when outdoors, utilizing approved insect repellent and making sure windows and doors have tight screens.

[This report adds another city in Ventura County, California to localities where _Aedes aegypti_ have been found, increasing the geographical range of this mosquito in the county. The report above is not clear about follow up measures that the County Environmental Health Division will take to increase surveillance and attempt control of this mosquito. The open question is if this mosquito has become established in Ojai or the other California localities where the mosquito has been found previously or if they have been eradicated. Breeding sites can be difficult to find. There is no indication in the above report of how these mosquitoes arrived in Ojai.

Although the report above points out that _A. aegypti_ is capable of transmitting any of these mentioned viruses, ongoing transmission is unlikely; however, it is not zero, so elimination of this mosquito as quickly as possible in the localities where they have recently been found is prudent. Once well established, this mosquito is difficult to eradicate. Control requires considerable continuous effort. - Mod.TY
