Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever update
--------------------------------------
The Health Ministry Basic Health Services General Director Seracattin
Com has stated that: "This year we've had 551 Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) patients, but there have only been 33 deaths."

Health Ministry Basic Health Services General Director Seracattin Com
explained that those people who contract CCHF but successfully recover
develop antibodies against the virus. "We collect blood samples from
these patients and process their blood to produce hyper-immune
globulin. We administer this to patients suffering from the disease,"
he said. Even in severe cases, 9 out of 10 patients recovered from
the disease.

Com indicated that they would exhaust hyper-immune globulin stocks in several
months and would collect new blood samples, particularly from people
in the Kelkit Valley, which is infested by ticks. "We have records of
the patients who have suffered from CCHF since 2002. We will conduct
medical examinations and collect blood samples from suitable donors. I
can't say how much blood we'll collect; we will try to amass a stock
that will last for one year," he said. Com asserted that the sera are
being successfully used in many cases.

[This report documents a considerable increase in CCHF cases and
fatalities in Turkey during the course of the past 4 weeks. The death
total is now reported to be 33 (among 551 cases) compared with 15
deaths among approximately 300 cases by the beginning of June 2008.
The recently developed immunotherapy procedure outlined above has yet
to fulfill its potential.
