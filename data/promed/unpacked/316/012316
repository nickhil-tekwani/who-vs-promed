Fear has hit a village in Sotik after a man died while 6 others were hospitalised after allegedly coming into contact with the carcass of an animal suspected to have died of anthrax. The 60-year-old man from Itoik village died early Tuesday morning [19 Jan 2021] at Kaplong Mission Hospital where he was receiving treatment. He is said to have participated in disposing the carcass of the cow.

It is, however, unclear whether the group feasted on the animal. Health officials said the deceased had pale wounds, a sign suggesting he may have consumed the meat. The 6 who are admitted to Tenwek Hospital in Bomet are out of danger.

According to residents, 7 cows have already died in the area following the suspected anthrax outbreak a week ago. Kapkures chief David Langat confirmed the incident, saying the area is prone to cases of anthrax.

County director of veterinary Dr. Wilson Serem confirmed the outbreak of the disease but was quick to exonerate his office from any blame, saying the cases were not reported to them. Addressing the press, Dr. Serem confirmed the area covering Kipsonoi and Mutarakwa is prone to the disease, saying every year cases of the disease are reported.

He said the vaccination of animals against the disease will start in the next one week. "Anyone whose cow dies with symptoms that resemble anthrax should report to us immediately...they should not touch it to avert infections and deaths," Serem said.

On Wednesday morning [20 Jan 2021], public health officials and the Kenya Red Cross team visited the area to sensitise locals against coming into contact with dead animals.

[You will see from our reports in February 2020 that this county had outbreaks with bovine and human outbreaks last year. In 2020, some 24 people were affected with cutaneous lesions and multiple cattle died. Clearly both the human population in Bomet is still unaware of the risks of butchering and eating cattle that have suddenly died, and the veterinary services have been behind in getting livestock vaccinated as they came around to another "anthrax" season.

Bomet County is in the former Rift Valley Province of Kenya and was created from the former Kericho district through Kenya gazette supplement no. 53 of 1992. It had a population of 875 689 in 2019 and has an area of 1630 square kilometers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomet_County). - Mod.MHJ
