UNDIAGNOSED DISEASES, MANGO - PAKISTAN: (SINDH) UPDATE

Mango is grown over an area of 94 000 hectares [232 000 acres] in the
country, its area in Sindh is about 43 500 hectares [107 500 acres]
with an output of 320 700 tons. Fresh and dried mangoes are exported
to Dubai, Saudi Arabia, Europe, Singapore and Malaysia. Pakistan
offers more than 100 varieties.

The present situation of mango orchards in Sindh needs special
attention, as they are suffering from unknown diseases resulting in
death of trees [see ProMED-mail post 20090511.1762].

Mango suffers from a number of diseases. It is clear from symptoms
that the present problem is not because of any one disease. It is a
complicated case, which mostly emerges due to combined attacks of
various diseases. Dying of trees or decline is generally observed in
neglected orchards. Almost all varieties are susceptible to these
diseases.

Now it is the responsibility of researchers to identify the actual
cause of the problems and find out ways to control them effectively.
There is a need to apply an integrated disease management principle.
[Some of] the major constraints for mango growers in Sindh are [the
environmental conditions], weak linkages between research and
extension, [as well as] difficulties in meeting good agricultural
practice and phytosanitary requirements

[Mango (_Mangifera indica_) is one of the most important fruits
worldwide. It can be affected by a large number of diseases, many of
which are due to fungal pathogens. No virus has been reported from
mango so far.

In Pakistan, outbreaks of the fungal diseases quick decline
(_Lasiodiplodia theobromae_) in 2008 (ProMED-mail post no.
20080229.0832), and powdery mildew (_Oidium mangiferae_) in 2007
(ProMED-mail post no. 20070611.1900) have been reported. Other mango
diseases known to occur in Pakistan include anthracnose caused by the
fungi _Glomerella cingulata_ or _Colletotrichum acutatum_ and
considered the most important disease of the crop, as well as leaf and
stem blights, diebacks and root rots due to a range of different
pathogens.

The hypothesis put forward in the report above, that a combination of
a number of diseases and external factors causes the problem, makes
good sense. Undiagnosed diseases were reported from Sindh already in
2009 (ProMED-mail post 20090511.1762), but reliable identification of
the pathogens involved has apparently not yet been achieved.
