The chairman of the European Livestock
Association's Animal Health and Welfare Committee
has cast serious doubt over whether there was a
foot-and-mouth [FMD] outbreak in Cyprus.

"As a veterinarian who spent most of his life on
control and eradication of FMD, I have serious
concerns about the EU guided measures applied in
Cyprus," Dr Paul Sutmoller wrote in response to
MEP (member of the European Parliament) Marios
Matsakis' letter to the European Commission, in
which the latter clearly stated his doubts over
whether there really was an FMD outbreak in
Cyprus.

At the same time however, the Veterinary Services
yesterday [13 Dec 2007] announced they had
spotted 44 new cases of FMD in an Aradippou farm.
Farm owner Lefteris Eleftheriou has said he would
not allow the culling of his animals unless he
was compensated first.

After closely observing the situation in Cyprus
from the 1st day the disease was spotted,
Sutmoller said he had no reason to doubt the
official and EU declaration of the occurrence of
FMD in Cyprus. However, he believed there was a
possibility the disease could have been brought
under control with vaccinations instead.

He wrote the following posting for ProMED-mail:
"With regard to the stamping-out method used to
try to control and eradicate the present FMD type
O outbreak in Cyprus, one wonders if immediate
vaccination of the susceptible livestock
population on the island has been considered to
bring the outbreak under control quickly. There
are no scientific reasons to believe that under
the prevailing conditions of Cyprus stamping-out
may be more effective than vaccination in
controlling the disease." [See ProMED-mail
20071109.3637. - Mod.AS]

The FMD expert then went on to cast serious doubt
over whether there was an FMD outbreak in Cyprus.
"If there had in fact been FMD in Cyprus, the
disease would most likely have spread widely by
the time of detection and notification." He
added, "Vaccination of the livestock population
would have been the only logical way to control
and eradicate the disease. The senseless
slaughter of so-called 'infected' flocks of sheep
and goats would have been prevented."

In the days and weeks that followed the 1st
mention of the disease, Sutmoller became
convinced that the diagnosis of FMD in Cyprus was
not substantiated.

"From the reports, I concluded that there was
never any FMD on the island, since no virus was
detected in a large number of samples," he
claimed, before fuelling rumours that the disease
had come from the occupied north: "Animal
movements of vaccinated animals from the northern
part of the island under Turkish administration
could very well explain the antibodies that were
found."

Still, he added, the EU Commission continued to
recommend the continuation of "the senseless
culling." "My long experience as chief of
laboratories of the Pan American FMD Centre has
taught me that one must be extremely careful when
making a positive diagnosis in an FMD-free
country," Sutmoller explained. "Virus detection
is a must, because a misdiagnosis creates a
disaster in terms of human and animal suffering,
with staggering economic consequences."

He concluded in his letter to Matsakis, "I hope
that the scientific arguments of this letter will
assist you in convincing the EU and veterinary
authorities that future decisions on disease
control and eradication must be based on sound
diagnosis, epidemiological facts, and local
conditions."

The head of the Veterinary Services, Charalambos
Kakoyiannis, yesterday [13 Dec 2007] shifted the
blame onto the EU after calling for an urgent
press conference.

Offering a round-up of all the actions taken
since the 1st case was spotted back in early
November [2007], Kakoyiannis said all the
measures taken by the government were made in
co-operation with the EU.

"Never did we say there was a live virus of FMD
in Cyprus," he stated. "What we said was that
there were cases that came either from older
animals or the importation of animals to Cyprus
from abroad."

He added, however, that 50 animals on the
Aradippou farm would have to be slaughtered "for
psychological reasons," because only by culling
all the positive-testing animals "we will be able
to rid Cyprus of this disease."

Meanwhile, the chairman of the House Agriculture
Committee, Yiannakis Thoma of AKEL [progressive
party of the working people], called the entire
FMD affair a "fiasco."

"This was not an easy thing to say, if there was
no basis on which its substantiation could be
supported," said Thoma after his Committee had
discussed the issue yesterday [13 Dec 2007]. "And
the basis was the opinion of experts from 7
countries who gathered in Brussels and who
clearly stated in a written announcement that in
Cyprus there was no active or live virus, which
is transmitted."

He added that the European Union had no choice
but to order the implementation of measures as
the Agriculture Ministry had announced that there
was an FMD epidemic spreading through the island.
"What is clear today [14 Dec 2007] is that there
was never an FMD epidemic," the AKEL deputy
stated, adding: "This means that we wrongly
informed the European Commission that there was
an epidemic and we provoked all these measures
that today Cypriot farmers and the Cyprus economy
are being asked to pay." What we have today, he
continued, are a few hundred animals that for
some reason -- possibly due to vaccinations they
received -- are showing positive indications of
the disease.

"The choice to cull animals in the beginning
could not have been avoided; but I believe that
slaughtering the 2 farms of the Kyriacou brothers
took place at such a point in time when it was
clear that there was no epidemic," said Thoma.

Director of the Veterinary Services Charalambos
Kakoyiannis said on Wednesday [12 Dec 2007] that
next week the measures, taken in a 10-km (6.2 mi)
zone due to FMD, will be lifted. "The work has
been done within the 10-km zone and over the next
few days we hope that the measures will be
lifted," he said.

Kakoyiannis noted that checks will continue and
be intensified in the wider region in the hope
that "we will manage by the end of January
[2008] to complete the checks and that Cyprus
will be officially rid of FMD."

He added that some 29 000 samples have been taken
and that there were certain animals in the 3-km
(2 mi) zone, where the measures have already been
lifted, that were found positive and will be put
down, and compensation will be given to the
stockbreeders.

Kakoyiannis also said that isolated cases were
being found outside the 10-km zone but noted that
this did not alter the position that the flocks
would be tested and any animals found positive
would be removed.

Replying to questions, Kakoyiannis said the virus
had not yet been located and it was not certain
whether the origin of the virus could be traced.

"We hope that the presence of the virus is not
confirmed because we will then face difficulties.
So far it is not certain where the virus came
from, that is if it was the arrival of livestock
from abroad or an infection," he explained.

In the past several weeks, hundreds of sheep and
goats have been slaughtered for fear of the FMD
and restrictions were imposed by the EU on the
movement of animals and the sale of animal
products.

Agriculture Minister Fotis Fotiou yesterday [10
Dec 2007] announced the lifting of all measures
prohibiting the movement of animals between the 3
(2 mi) and 10-km (6.2 mi) zones around the
infected areas where FMD disease was detected
last month [November 2007].

He said that the decision was taken by the
European Commission adding that the procedure for
the compensation of animal breeders will be taken
in the next few days.

Cyprus has culled hundreds of animals in a bid to
contain its 1st FMD outbreak in more than 40
years.

[The recent unification of the 3-km (2 mi)
protection zone and the 10-km (6 mi) surveillance
zone, enabling free animal movements within the
entire 10 km zone (but not yet between the Zone
and the rest of the country), is another
alleviating step towards the expected termination
of the emergency situation which has been
prevailing in Cyprus since the beginning of
November (2007). At present, the authorities
continue large-scale serological surveillance,
culling the individual seropositive animals (but
not entire flocks, as done initially).

The initial positive results of the NSP
[non-structural protein] ELISA [enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay] tests, performed in sheep in
Dromolaxia, which gave rise to the alert and
subsequent official notification of FMD -- could
have been the result of past application of
(partly or poorly purified) inactivated FMD
vaccines. The title "positive serology" given by
ProMED-mail to this thread from its early stages
reflected the view that this was not "introduced
virus" but rather "introduced (or locally
produced) antibodies", most probably by
vaccination of (imported or local) sheep (see
further the commentary in ProMED-mail posting
20071114.3698, dated 14 Nov 2007). This view was
further substantiated by the fact that no
seropositive pigs or cattle were found in the
Protection and the Surveillance Zones. Mass
culling and mass vaccination seemed questionable.

The serosurveillance activities, undertaken by
Cyprus authorities, should have preferably been
followed by similar steps in the northern part of
the Island, controlled by Turkey. Any available
information from the said territory will be
appreciated.

During the last meeting of EU's Standing
Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health
(Section Animal Health and Welfare), 3-4 Dec
2007, the Veterinary Services of Cyprus presented
their PowerPoint report "FMD in Cyprus"
(available on line at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/fmd_34122007_cy.pdf>.


The next meeting of the Section is due in
Brussels on Wed 19 Dec 2007, with "Foot-and-mouth
disease situation in Cyprus" as the 1st issue on
the agenda. - Mod.AS]
