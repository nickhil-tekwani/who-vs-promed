The health ministry announced on Saturday [16 Sep 2017] that 3 malaria cases have been recorded in the north in British tourists, but there was no cause for concern as the transmission risk is very low.

The ministry said that it had been informed by the World Health Organization that the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) diagnosed 3 malaria cases in British tourists who visited the north in August [2017].

The visitors stayed in a resort in Ayios Amvrosios, Kyrenia, and the symptoms began in the last week of August [2017], and they were diagnosed after their return to the UK in the 1st week of September 2017.

It has not yet been determined whether the patients contracted malaria in the north, but lab tests continue, and the ministry said that it had taken all preventive measures.

According to the ECDC, the risk of transmission is too low to be of concern, the ministry said. The last time malaria cases [autochthonous] were recorded in Cyprus was in 1967.

The health ministry said that for preventive reasons only, people wishing to visit the area in the north where the malaria cases were reported ought to take protective measures against mosquitoes, such as wearing long-sleeved shirts and trousers and using insect repellents.

The ministry also urged anyone who has travelled to the area and within the next one to 4 weeks develops a fever, shivering, or other relevant symptoms should consult a doctor.

It added that it was closely monitoring the situation and was in constant cooperation with the 2 health organizations.

[The report in the on-line Cyprus mail cannot be confirmed, either from the ECDC website or from the website of the Ministry of Health, Cyprus.

Ayios Amvrosios, Kyrenia is located in the northern part of Cyprus occupied by Turkey.

We presume these to be _P. vivax_ infections, but further details are needed, especially the exact locations where they were staying and the dates of their stay in northern Cyprus.

For further information, see my moderator comment to the present autochthonous _P. vivax_ cases in Greece in "Malaria, autochthonous P. vivax - Greece: 20170916.5320643." ProMED will be happy to post further information. - Mod.EP
