Raccoon bites 2 people, dog SPCA warns of possibly rabid animal in Wilmington
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A possibly rabid raccoon is being hunted on Wilmington's East Side
after 2 people and a dog were bitten Sunday [24 Jan 2010] in separate
attacks. County SPCA (Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals),
which handles animal incidents statewide, laid traps after bites were
reported blocks from the Wilmington police station, New Castle County
Courthouse and train station. The animal had not been captured as of
Wednesday [27 Jan 2010].

The human attacks were reported to the state Division of Public
Health and the man and woman are undergoing rabies treatment. They
were not identified by the SPCA. The dog is under observation by Kent
County SPCA. "People have to be obviously observant because there is
a raccoon that's out there acting in a bizarre fashion, which could
indicate that it's rabid," said Mary Ann D'Amato, community outreach
manager for Kent County SPCA

The 1st incident happened in the 600 block of Church Street, when a
woman was bitten near the ankle as she left Old Swedes Episcopal
Church. The raccoon was approaching the woman's daughter and she got
between them, said Capt. Brian Whipple of Delaware Animal Care and
Control in Camden. Later that day, a security guard was bitten on the
ankle outside the Chase Building at Walnut and Fourth streets, Whipple said.

Animal control also got a call from the 500 block of East Third
Street after a raccoon bit a dog, CoCo, outside its home. "The dog
was outside to relieve itself and the raccoon kind of came out of
nowhere," Whipple said. There was another sighting Tuesday [26 Jan
2010] of a raccoon eating trash in an alley behind apartments in the
200 block of West Street, Whipple said.

Rabies is a viral disease that affects the central nervous system of
mammals. It can be transmitted to another animal or person when the
saliva of a rabid animal comes in contact with a cut or wound during
a bite. While rabies can alter raccoons' behavior, so can mating and
birthing seasons, which begin at this time of year. Because the
attacks occurred in the general area and on the same day, Whipple
believes they involve the same animal.

[This incident highlights the desirability of routine vaccination of
all domestic animals (not an expensive option) where there is risk of
contact of pets with raccoons and other wild animals. Further
information regarding the outcome of the search for the suspected
rabid raccoon, and the extent of control of raccoon rabies by baited
vaccine in Delaware would be appreciated.
