[3] Possible transmission on cruise ship - Hong Kong to Viet Nam
Date: Mon 3 Feb 2020 9:26 PM CST
Source: South China Morning Post [edited]
https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3048784/coronavirus-least-three-cases-among-4000-passengers-china


Three passengers that took the same cruise from China to Viet Nam in January [2020] have been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, with a further 2 suspected of being infected, the South China Morning Post has learned. While 1 case was confirmed by local government officials in Guangdong province, across the border from Hong Kong, a doctor working at a major hospital in the provincial capital of Guangzhou confirmed an additional 2 confirmed cases and 2 suspected cases at the facility. All 4 were aboard the same cruise ship, the World Dream, which sailed with more than 4000 passengers from Nansha port in Guangzhou for Viet Nam on [19 Jan 2020], before returning on [24 Jan 2020]. The 5-night "Impressions of Vietnam" cruise typically docks in tourist hotspots including Da Nang, Ha Long Bay, and Nha Trang.

"There was a clear risk of cross-contagion on board the cruise ship," said the doctor, who declined to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media. But the doctor said he decided to disclose the information out of concern that thousands of passengers from the same cruise were at large, even though it has not been confirmed that there was an outbreak on board.

On [Sun 2 Feb 2020], authorities in Zhaoqing city in northern Guangdong said that 1 resident who had taken the same cruise had been diagnosed with coronavirus on [Sat 1 Feb 2020]. This is the only case the government has confirmed in connection with the cruise, according to government-run website, http://www.ycwb.com [in Chinese]. However, the local health authority urged 41 additional Zhaoqing residents who had taken the cruise to report to self-quarantine at home or contact the local health department should they develop a fever.

There were 108 Hubei residents on the ship, the authority said, including 28 from Wuhan, the epicentre of a coronavirus outbreak that has infected more than 17 000.

The doctor said that her hospital, one of 30 facilities designated for treating coronavirus in Guangdong, had reported the 4 cases to the Guangzhou Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, which informed the cruise operator via the Chinese customs regulator. Dream Cruises said that after becoming aware that a cruise passenger was confirmed to be infected on [Sun 2 Feb 2020], it took action to inform authorities and passengers. "Dream Cruises has subsequently been in contact with local government bodies and tourism boards to extend every assistance in regards to this situation including providing passenger and travel agent lists and will continue to cooperate with the authorities as information becomes available," the company said in a statement released to The Post. "Additionally, Dream Cruises has provided information to travel agents that had booked passengers on the same cruise in order to assist in communicating the situation to our guests."

As of [Mon 3 Feb 2020], 683 confirmed cases of coronavirus had been confirmed in Guangdong province, the manufacturing heartland of south China, with 2660 under medical observation, according to the provincial government. On Sunday, Dream Cruises released a statement on its official Weibo account confirming that all passengers underwent body temperature checks at Nansha Wharf on [24 Jan 2020], and that all passengers with a fever were tested for the coronavirus and were all negative. Also on Sunday, Guangzhou's state-run Nanfang Daily said that local authorities had conducted body temperature checks on the 4482 passengers who returned from Viet Nam on [24 Jan 2020]. Another 607 people who boarded the same ship and cruised to Hong Kong for a 2-night tour on the same day were also tested when the ship left Nansha.

There were 18 cases of fever in total, but none tested positive for the coronavirus at that time, the Nanfang Daily reported. The Nansha Disease Prevention and Control Centre, which conducted the temperature checks, confirmed that they had taken place, but would not comment on further confirmed cases related to the cruise when contacted by The Post.

However, with the outbreak of coronavirus, the ship is set to temporarily shift its homeport to Keelung in Taiwan, suspending operations out of Hong Kong and Guangzhou, the parent company announced last week. Sailings out of Hong Kong and Guangzhou between [9 Feb 2020] and [22 Mar 2020] have been cancelled.

On [Mon 3 Feb 2020], it was announced that cruise lines worldwide will deny boarding to passengers and crew who have recently travelled to China, according to the global Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA). "CLIA Members have suspended crew movements from mainland China and will deny boarding to any individual, whether guest or crew, who has travelled from or through mainland China within the previous 14 days," the body's Hamburg office said in a statement.

Last week [week of 27 Jan 2020], more than 6000 tourists were detained aboard a cruise ship in Italy after 2 Chinese passengers fell ill. The passengers tested negative for coronavirus.

[The 14 day incubation period is almost up from 24 Jan 2020. If in fact fomites are a means of transmission of the virus, it is possible that the boat was potentially a source for transmission of the virus to the next cruise, although given the experiences cruise companies had with norovirus outbreaks (a virus that is easily transmitted through fomites), one hopes that standard cleaning of rooms and the ship in between sailings includes rigorous cleaning of all surfaces to avoid disease transmission. - Mod.MPP]

[4] Infection prevention and control for the care of patients with 2019-nCoV in healthcare settings - ECDC
Date: Mon 3 Feb 2020
Source: European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) [edited]
https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/nove-coronavirus-infection-prevention-control-patients-healthcare-settings.pdf


1. Initial contact and risk assessment (primary and emergency care)
Emergency services and primary care staff, including physicians, nursing and administrative staff with patient contact, should:
1.1 Be aware of: a) the current 2019-nCoV epidemiologic situation in their country and globally, b) known risk factors for infections, c) clinical symptoms and signs of 2019-nCoV cases, d) recommended infection prevention and control measures, e) procedures for reporting and transfer of persons under investigation and of probable and confirmed cases.
1.2 Be aware of the availability of case definitions for testing and reporting risk assessment and diagnostic purposes.
1.3 Perform a point of care risk assessment, including a review of travel, clinical and epidemiological history and the clinical presentation of the patient, to assess the likelihood of 2019-nCoV infection. The assessment should be based on the latest case definitions available. It aims at performing a rapid evaluation of the risk of transmission (based on signs, symptoms and procedures likely to result in exposure to respiratory droplets and aerosols).
1.4 Assess the on-site availability of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for all personnel at the point of care to apply standard, contact and droplet precautions.
1.5 Be aware that the PPE components for clinical assessment of suspected 2019-nCoV cases in these settings are the same as the ones specified for care of confirmed patients described under (3.2.2).
1.6 Be aware that suspected cases of 2019-nCoV should be isolated or at least separated from other patients and instructed to wear a surgical mask. Unnecessary contacts should be avoided.
1.7 Contact a designated 24/7 response service to report the case, arrange diagnostic testing and if the initial assessment indicates it is appropriate (such as symptoms and signs that increase risks of transmission), safe transfer to a designated acute care unit for diagnostic evaluation.

2. Patient transfer
2.1 For ambulance transfers of suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV cases, ensure the use of personal protective equipment for healthcare staff, the decontamination of the ambulance after the transfer of the patient and safe waste management as per the appropriate procedure as specified under 3.3.
2.2 Ensure the availability of a preparedness plan for ambulance transfers of suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV cases, addressing the temporal and geographic coverage of adequately trained staff and equipment.

3. Hospital
3.1. Administrative measures
3.1.1 Ensure the designation of units prepared for the diagnostic evaluation and units prepared for the treatment of 2019-nCoV patients.
3.1.2 Plan for surge capacity, addressing estimated needs for patient beds, PPE, staff, diagnostics, including laboratory capacity and therapeutics.
3.1.3 Ensure access to timely virological investigations in accordance with the algorithm for laboratory diagnosis of 2019-nCoV [3].
3.1.4 Be aware that the minimum requirements for designated units for the management of confirmed 2019-nCoV patients would be: the availability of isolation rooms with dedicated bathroom, staff adequately trained in the safe diagnostic evaluation and management of 2019-nCoV patients, availability of appropriate PPEs, adequate laboratory support, and appropriate cleaning and waste management procedures (3.3). Negative pressure isolation rooms are strongly recommended for the performance of aerosol generating procedures (see below point 3.2.3).
3.2. Patient management
3.2.1 Confirmed cases requiring admission should be placed in an isolation room with a dedicated bathroom. The placement in airborne precaution single rooms with negative pressure and anteroom, if available, is encouraged until more information about transmission routes is available.
3.2.2 Healthcare workers in contact with a confirmed case, or a suspected case of 2019-nCoV, should wear PPE for contact, droplet and airborne transmission of pathogens: FFP2 or FFP3 respirator tested for fitting, eye protection (i.e. goggles or face shield), long-sleeved water-resistant gown and gloves;
3.2.3 Aerosol generating procedures (AGS) include tracheal intubation, bronchial suctioning, bronchoscopy, and sputum induction have been linked to increased risk of transmission of coronaviruses and require particular protection measures [3]. AGS should be performed in a negative pressure isolation room. The number of persons in the room should be limited to a minimum during such procedures and all persons present should wear: a well-fitted FFP3 respirator; eye protection; long-sleeved impermeable protective gowns; and gloves.
3.2.4 Healthcare workers should strictly follow the procedures for putting on ('donning') of PPE and for safe removal in correct sequence ('doffing') of PPE [7]. These procedures should be performed with proper supervision by a trained observer. Active assistance during donning and doffing is an option for minimising the risk of accidental contamination.
3.2.5 Hand hygiene should be performed immediately after removal of PPE.
3.2.6 It is essential to ensure that the staff assigned to treat 2019-nCoV patients is trained in the proper use of PPE. Quality assurance should be promoted through appropriate systems, such as the requirement, before assigning staff to 2019-NCOV patient care, for a certificate of demonstrated competency in the correct use of PPE.
3.2.7 Personnel providing care to 2019-nCoV cases need to be actively followed-up for development of symptoms and provided occupational health support. A record of all staff providing care for confirmed 2019-nCoV cases must be maintained. Staff providing care to confirmed 2019-nCoV cases, and staff who have been exposed to cases before the implementation of infection control measures, should be vigilant for fever and any respiratory symptoms in the 14 days following the last exposure to a confirmed case, and should seek testing, and thereafter self-isolate if they become unwell.
3.2.8 The use of dedicated or, if possible, disposable medical equipment (e.g. blood pressure cuffs, stethoscopes and thermometers) is strongly recommended.
3.2.9 Visits to the patient should be limited to the absolute minimum. Visitors should be instructed to wear appropriate PPE. A register of visitors should be maintained and monitoring for symptoms of 2019-nCoV for 14 days after the last visit to a patient with confirmed 2019-nCoV is recommended.
3.2.10 The duration of infectivity for 2019-nCoV patients remains unknown but critically ill patients may shed 2019-nCoV for long periods. Confirmed 2019-nCoV cases should remain in isolation until recovery from clinical symptoms of 2019-nCoV and viral detection tests should assist in the decision on when to discontinue additional precautions for hospitalised patients.
3.3. Environmental cleaning and waste management
3.3.1 Staff engaged in environmental cleaning and waste management should wear appropriate PPE, as indicated in the ECDC Tutorial on critical aspects of the safe use of PPE [7].
3.2.11 Regular cleaning followed by disinfection of patients' rooms, furniture and frequently touched surfaces with hospital disinfectants active against viruses is recommended.
3.2.12 Waste should be treated as infectious clinical waste Category B (UN3291) [8] and handled according to healthcare facility policies and local regulation
3.4. Laboratory testing
3.4.1 All specimens collected for laboratory investigation should be regarded as potentially infectious, and healthcare workers who collect or transport clinical specimens should adhere rigorously to Standard Precautions to minimise the possibility of exposure to pathogens. The WHO Aide-memoire on Standard Precautions in Health Care is available from http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/EPR_AM2_E7.pdf.
3.4.2 Laboratories should adhere to the guidance in these 2 documents: The European Committee for Standardisation: CWA15793 Laboratory Biorisk Management, 2011, available from https://www.uab.cat/doc/CWA15793_2011 and, Laboratory testing for 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in suspected human cases of January 2020, available from https://www.who.int/publications-detail/laboratory-testing-for-2019-novel-coronavirus-in-suspected-human-cases-20200117.

[5] Experimental drug trial - remdesivir
Date: Mon 3 Feb 2020
Source: The Sixth Tone [edited]
https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005155/china-to-begin-testing-ebola-drug-on-coronavirus-patients


China has announced it will immediately commence clinical trials on an experimental drug, remdesivir, in hopes of finding an effective treatment for the novel coronavirus that has killed over 360 people and infected another 17 000 since mid-December [2019]. The trial, which begins [on Mon 3 Feb 2020] and runs through [27 Apr 2020], will take place in the central city of Wuhan and include a total of 270 novel coronavirus patients, Sixth Tone's sister publication The Paper reported [Sun 2 Feb 2020]. It will be overseen by Cao Bin, an expert in respiratory infections at Beijing's China-Japan Friendship Hospital.

The news comes just 3 days after a paper was published in the New England Journal of Medicine claiming that remdesivir, which is not yet approved by drug regulators in any country, may have helped alleviate the symptoms of a 35 year old male novel coronavirus patient in Washington state [ref: Holshue ML, DeBolt C, et al. First case of 2019 novel coronavirus in the United States. NEJM, available online 31 Jan 2020. doi:10.1056/NEJMoa2001191; https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191].

According to the NEJM paper, doctors on [26 Jan 2020] administered remdesivir to the unidentified man, who had been diagnosed shortly after returning from a visit to Wuhan. The next day, his condition began to improve, and almost all of his symptoms had subsided by time of publication. The authors noted that they had observed no "adverse events" related to the treatment.

On [31 Jan 2020], the day the paper was published, the drug's developer, California-based Gilead Sciences, announced it had provided doses of the drug to China for use "in a small number of patients" and was working with China's health authorities to set up a randomized, controlled trial to test the drug's effectiveness against the novel coronavirus.

Historically, unapproved or in-development drugs have sometimes been used to treat diseases for which there are no accepted alternatives. Although there is no clinical data on remdesivir's effectiveness against the novel coronavirus, the company claims it has been used in animal subjects to treat 2 other coronaviruses -- SARS and MERS -- with some success. A 2018 clinical trial found it was less effective than other drugs at treating Ebola, another viral disease.

On [2 Feb 2020], China's Center for Drug Evaluation announced it had approved Gilead Sciences' application, with trials to begin the next day [3 Feb 2020]. As of time of publication, neither the China-Japan Friendship Hospital nor Cao, the doctor overseeing the trials, had responded to Sixth Tone's requests for comment.

There are currently no drugs approved to treat the novel coronavirus. Although a number of companies including Johnson & Johnson and GlaxoSmithKline have announced work on a vaccine, development is expected to take years.

In the meantime, Chinese researchers are experimenting with existing antiviral drugs, including those for MERS and HIV, in hopes of finding an effective stopgap. In addition to the just-announced remdesivir trial, doctors at Wuhan's Jin Yin-tan Hospital last month [January 2020] launched a randomized, controlled trial of the anti-HIV drugs lopinavir and ritonavir, a cocktail often marketed as Kaletra. The pairing, which a previous study suggested might be effective against SARS, work by targeting protease, an enzyme both HIV and coronaviruses use to reproduce.

Others are working to decode the novel coronavirus to speed up the search for potentially effective treatments. XtalPi, a Massachusetts-based biotech startup, announced [Sun 2 Feb 2020] that it had screened 2900 FDA-approved drugs against novel coronavirus proteins and found 96 on-the-market drugs that could potentially inhibit the virus' activity. "We got a list of drug repurposing candidates and predicted their binding affinity ranking," Lai Lipeng, the company's co-founder and head of AI research, told Sixth Tone. "By sharing this list with the rest of the research community, we hope to help expand the search for a cure for the novel coronavirus, find partners who can experimentally validate these candidates, and hopefully shorten the time needed for an effective treatment to reach patients."

According to Lu Hongzhou, a leading virologist at Shanghai's Huashan Hospital, new antivirals like remdesivir may be more effective than existing drugs such as lopinavir. Unlike lopinavir, which seeks to block the virus from reproducing, Lu says remdesivir acts directly on the virus itself. "The drug would work on patients in any condition, and starting the treatment in the early stages of the illness can improve the prognosis," Lu told Sixth Tone. "If we can get the virus early, we can stop it from further damaging the body and prevent the sick from getting sicker."

Not everyone is as sanguine about the experimental drug's potential, however. Jiang Xuefeng, a professor of chemistry and molecular engineering at East China Normal University in Shanghai, warns that one isolated case in the US is not statistically significant. "No random, controlled, or blank samples were used in that case," he told Sixth Tone. "The effectiveness of remdesivir cannot be determined by this single case." According to Jiang, even if remdesivir does prove effective in treating novel coronavirus patients, that doesn't make it safe to use: It can take years, he said, to fully understand the pharmacological and toxicological side effects of new drugs.

"Take thalidomide, for example. It was sold to pregnant women as a cure for morning sickness in the 1950s, but 4 or 5 years later people discovered that it was causing birth defects," Jiang said. "Given the circumstances, it's totally understandable that people want a cure for the novel coronavirus as soon as possible. But as scientists, we have to be extremely cautious."

[This article does a good job of discussing the hazards of too rapid a rush to use drugs following short trials. Clinical trials test drugs on limited numbers of individuals, at times fewer than 5000. A serious complication that can be life threatening may occur 1 in 20 000 doses administered and not show up in the 5000 clinical trial subjects. But once a drug is released and potentially millions of individuals will be exposed to the drug, 50 deaths might occur for every one million receiving the drug.... which, when calculating a population of 1.4 billion, could be devastating. - Mod.MPP]

[6] Experimental drug cocktail - Thailand
Date: Sat 1 Feb 2020
Source: Bloomberg News [edited]
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-02/thailand-sees-good-result-from-using-drug-mixture-on-coronavirus


A cocktail of antiviral drugs appeared effective in treating a seriously ill patient infected with the coronavirus that's spreading around the world, a Thai health official said. The HIV medicines lopinavir and ritonavir, sold by AbbVie Inc. as Kaletra, were used on 3 patients along with the anti-flu medication oseltamivir, sold by Roche Holding AG and Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. as Tamiflu, Somkiat Lalitwongsa, director of the Rajavithi Hospital in Bangkok, told reporters [Mon 3 Feb 2020].

Kaletra is already being studied in a randomized, controlled trial -- the gold standard for testing new medical products -- in coronavirus patients in Wuhan, China, where the outbreak began. The Thai doctors administered the flu drug because of research indicating that it helped some patients afflicted with a more-deadly coronavirus that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS. A study by researchers in France recommended it be used in patients with MERS, but discontinued if tests show they don't have flu.

"There's not enough evidence to support the effectiveness just yet," Somkiat said. "But we report to contribute to the medical community globally. The results look good so far." Of 3 patients in Thailand on whom the unique 3-drug therapy was initiated, 2 are continuing to receive the medications, Somkiat said. Treatment was discontinued in one patient who developed a rash. One of the 2 continuing to receive the medicines has tested negative for the Wuhan coronavirus, he said. "Because there's no standard procedure yet, we're trying new combinations of drugs," Somkiat said.

No drugs, including Tamiflu, have been approved to treat coronaviruses, and Tamiflu is aimed specifically at flu viruses, according to Roche. Neither Tamiflu nor Xofluza, another Roche flu drug, are likely to be effective at treating the Wuhan coronavirus, the company said in a statement. Roche is committed to supporting WHO and other groups with expertise and advice on the coronavirus and pandemic prevention, the statement said.
