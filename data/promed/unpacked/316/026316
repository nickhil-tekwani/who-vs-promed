Two cases of vaccine-derived poliovirus have been reported from Bambari health district. The index case presented with acute flaccid paralysis [AFP], while the 2nd case was an asymptomatic contact of the index case. There is a high risk of transmission of the virus, as both cases were among internally displaced person with an estimated population of 8000. The 2 cases had no previous history of vaccination for polio. Vaccination coverage in the affected district is 50%, with insecurity being one of the main obstacles to access.

Central African Republic (CAR) health minister Dr Pierre Somse has announced the existence of 2 polio outbreaks in the country, specifically in the districts of Bambari (center) and Bimbo (south). Speaking on national radio on Tuesday [28 May 2019], the minister said children have had severe flaccid paralysis in these areas, and the analysis of their faeces by the CAR laboratories suggest the existence of the polio virus. Many children in these areas therefore have signs of paralysis of their lower limbs.

The minister appealed to parents to bring their children to health centers as soon as possible to be vaccinated against the virus until other laboratories can definitively confirm the existence of the epidemic in the country.

In CAR, the polio vaccine is free and, according to specialists, if only one case of polio is identified in a region, the Ministry of Health will declare the situation an epidemic. With the presence of the polio virus in the country, CAR has had 3 epidemics this year [2019], including hepatitis E in Bocaranga in the country's north west and yellow fever in the central region of Sibut.

Two cases of polio have been reported in the Central African Republic, the World Health Organization said in a report on Tuesday [28 May 2019], the latest setback for global efforts to eradicate the crippling disease. The cases, reported to WHO on [24 May 2019], were caused by "vaccine-derived" polio rather than the wild type of the virus that still circulates in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

"There is a high risk of transmission of the virus, as both cases were among internally displaced persons (in an area) with an estimated population of 8000," the report said. "The 2 cases had no previous history of vaccination for polio. Vaccination coverage in the affected district is 50%, with insecurity being one of the main obstacles to access."

Latest figures from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative show there have been 10 vaccine-derived polio cases this year: 8 in Nigeria, 1 in Somalia, and 1 in Democratic Republic of Congo. Pakistan and Afghanistan have reported 24 cases of the wild type.

Polio is a virus that spreads in areas with poor sanitation. It attacks the nervous system and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours of infection. Children under 5 are the most vulnerable, but polio can be prevented with vaccination. Vaccine-derived cases tend to occur in places with low vaccine coverage and poor sanitation, as people who have been vaccinated excrete the virus, putting those who have not been vaccinated at risk of catching it.

The risk of vaccine-derived polio cases can be avoided by switching from using live oral polio vaccines (OPV) -- which are highly effective, cheap, and easy to deliver but contain live virus -- to "inactivated" vaccines (IPV), which are not effective for fighting the wild type but contain no live virus [Not true. See comment in [4] below. - Mod.MPP].

The use of OPV is being scaled down in a phased manner as countries eliminate circulating wild polio virus strains.

Africa could be declared free of endemic "wild" polio early next year [2020] if a strain last seen in Nigeria almost 3 years ago does not resurface, WHO's Africa director said on Tuesday [28 May 2019]. Africa's last case of wild polio was recorded in Nigeria in August 2016. The country can now begin the months of paperwork needed before declaring that the virus is no longer circulating there, WHO Africa regional director Matshidiso Moeti told Reuters. "We are hopeful that the way things are going, sometime early next year [2020] it might be possible," Moeti said.

There is no cure for polio, which attacks the nervous system and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours of infection. Children under 5 are the most vulnerable, but there is a vaccine that prevents the disease. However, traces of the vaccine used against "wild" polio are excreted by people who have been vaccinated, and in places with poor vaccine coverage and poor sanitation, that can cause outbreaks of "vaccine-derived" polio.

The risk of vaccine-derived polio can be avoided by switching from using live oral polio vaccines (OPV) -- which are highly effective, cheap, and easy to deliver but contain live virus -- to "inactivated" vaccines (IPV), which are not effective for fighting the wild type [Not true. The vaccine is very protective for the vaccinated individual but does not produce gut immunity (IgA), which can protect against local infection and spread to the environment and to others. - Mod.MPP] but contains no live virus.

Use of OPV is being scaled down in a phased manner as countries eliminate circulating wild polio virus strains. If Africa is declared free of the wild virus, health officials will be able to switch to the inactive vaccine, removing the risk of more vaccine-derived cases. "That's the plan; that's the hope," Moeti said, adding that she was cautiously optimistic.

Wild polio still circulates in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and an environmental sample was found in sewage in Iran earlier this month [May 2019], but all recent African cases have been "vaccine-derived" polio.

WHO said on Tuesday [28 May 2019] that 2 more suspected cases of the disease had been reported in Central African Republic, which would be the 11th and 12th cases in Africa this year [2019]. Oliver Rosenbauer, a WHO spokesman for polio eradication, said that although the 2 children involved were paralyzed, it was not yet confirmed that they had polio.

[Reading through the 3 media reports and short WHO AFRO report, it appears as though there has been isolation of VDPVs from the affected individuals, but genetic studies and confirmation from a reference lab are still pending.

Information on the age, gender, and laboratory results would be greatly appreciated. An important question is whether the isolated polioviruses are genetically similar, or are they different enough to declare these as 2 separate outbreaks?

Another query is the mention of 2 cases: one in Bimbo and the other in Bambari. Unless these were original locations of residence before displacement, this may be the addition of a 2nd case of AFP identified after the AFRO report was issued. Clarification would be greatly appreciated.

Of interest was a media report from MSF (Médecins sans Frontières; Doctors Without Borders) in early May [2019] that mentioned finally being able to access a community in the south east part of the country (having been cut off due to civil unrest for several years) and begin vaccinations in the area (https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/news-stories/story/msf-reaches-town-cut-violence-central-african-republic). This may reflect an increasing access to communities previously cut off from services where a VDPV may well have been circulating relatively silently for a significant amount of time. It's also important to mention that CAR has a border with the DR Congo, where there have been multiple outbreaks of cVDPV2 in the past 12 months.

A map showing the prefectures of the Central African Republic can be found at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/central-african-republic-administrative-map.htm. Bimbo is located in Ombella-M'Poko prefecture, near to Bangui (the capital city). Bambari is located in Ouaka prefecture.
