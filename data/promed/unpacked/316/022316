Since alerting the public last week to a dramatic rise in the number of pertussis cases in the area, the Mobile County Health Department has reported more cases related to the outbreak according to media coordinator Casandra Andrews. Known as whooping cough, pertussis is a highly contagious respiratory disease marked by uncontrollable, violent coughing which often makes it hard to breathe.

Between 30 Apr 2014 and 20 Jun 2014, Mobile County recorded approximately 25 pertussis cases. In 2013, just 8 confirmed and probable cases were reported in Mobile County. Of the 25 cases reported so far in the most recent outbreak, 15 have been confirmed, health officials said. There are multiple ongoing investigations of other pertussis cases not included in the 25 reported so far, health officials said. There have been a total of 29 cases reported for all of 2014 in Mobile County.

Dr Paola Maurtua-Neumann, a pediatrician with the University of South Alabama Children's Medical Center, has diagnosed a majority of the cases so far. She urges residents to be aware of the disease and its consequences. Once a pertussis case has been confirmed, she said, all family members residing with the infected person should receive treatment with antibiotics regardless of previous immunizations.

Idaho is seeing a surge in the number of whooping cough cases reported in 2014. In 2013, the Gem State had 87 reported cases, and in 2012, we saw 76. But so far, we've seen 179 reports in 2014 and it's only June.

The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare says a large part of the problem could be that many people aren't staying up to date on their Tdap [combined tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis] vaccination. It's a shot most people get as a child, but booster shots are required to keep the vaccine active. When enough older children and adults neglect to get their boosters, whooping cough can begin spreading.

Nearly 1/3 of 2014's infections have been in newborns who are too young to get the vaccination and have a harder time fighting off the cough. "Babies under 6 months, very often they're hospitalized," said Sarah Correll, an epidemiologist at Central District Health Department in Boise. "And when they're less than 4 months they definitely can die, so it is important that everyone in the home stay up to date on their vaccines and they protect the baby while it's trying to build up its immunity."

According to Health and Welfare, there has been one death due to whooping cough in Idaho in 2014, and it was a baby.

At least 50 people in Allegheny County have come down with whooping cough in 2014, putting the region on pace for one of its worst bouts in a decade with the respiratory disease. Most of the reported cases involve school-age children, all of whom recovered, according to county health officials. North Allegheny in McCandless was the most recent school district to confirm cases, announcing in June 2014 that 2 high school students contracted the bacterial ailment that doctors call pertussis.

"It's probably going to be on the high side this year. Usually, we get 50 or less" cases, said Dr Kristen Mertz, a medical epidemiologist at the Allegheny County Health Department. Although the department hasn't listed any pertussis-linked deaths in 2014, the disease is blamed in at least 2 fatalities in California, where an epidemic led to more than 3450 cases since January 2014. Reported cases nationwide topped 24 000 in 2013, about half the tally from 2012 but up from 11 651 in 2003, according to the CDC.

The illnesses in 2012 marked one of the largest pertussis epidemics since the 1950s and could foreshadow worse outbreaks, said Dr Wilbert van Panhuis, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh. "It was almost as bad as it was before the vaccine was introduced," said van Panhuis. Early pertussis shots went mainstream starting in the late 1940s.

"You're seeing adults and teenagers getting pertussis because their vaccinations are not working well," van Panhuis said. He said that trend, paired with some people's reluctance over vaccinations, might lead to more epidemics until pharmaceutical manufacturers introduce another pertussis vaccine. Preliminary state health data last month suggested as many as 177 confirmed pertussis cases in Pennsylvania since January 2014. The state recorded 633 cases in 2013, down from 1934 in 2012. Doctors said cyclical peaks in case volumes typically develop every 3 to 5 years.

The CDC is investigating the waning effectiveness of the current pertussis inoculation, given as part of so-called DTap [diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine for children 2 months through 6 years of age] and Tdap vaccines. "The message isn't that the vaccine is no good. It's still good. It's still effective," Dr. Mertz said. "Most kids are not getting the disease."

Health officials in El Dorado County and across California are seeing an uptick in pertussis cases and emphasizing the importance for children and adults to remain up to date on immunizations. 10 cases of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, have been reported in El Dorado County in 2014. That's more than twice the number of cases reported in 2013, County Health Officer Dr Alicia Paris-Pombo said.

6 cases were reported in South Lake Tahoe and 4 cases were reported on the West Slope. None have been fatal.

The cyclical disease typically peaks every 3 to 5 years and the last peak occurred in 2010, when El Dorado County had 54 cases and California had more than 9400 cases.

St Helena Hospital is curbing visits to its maternity section due to California's declaration of a whooping cough epidemic, the medical center announced Fri 20 Jun 2014. No visitors with coughing, runny nose, fever, or similar symptoms will be admitted to the family birthing center, according to Karen Phillips, infection prevention specialist at the hospital. In addition, children under 18 -- including siblings of newborns -- can enter only with proof of immunization for the bacterial disease, also called pertussis.

The restrictions at St Helena Hospital were issued following similar visiting curbs issued Tue 17 Jun 2014, at Queen of the Valley Medical Center in Napa.

Since 1 Jan 2014, confirmed and suspected cases of pertussis in Napa County already are up 7-fold, to 91, from the number reported for all of 2013. Whooping cough reports in California have totaled more than 3400 in 2014, the most in 4 years, with 2 deaths.

After setting a record in 2013, officials with the Tarrant County Health Department are concerned the number of recorded pertussis cases could again set a record in 2014. Whooping cough, known to physicians as pertussis, has seen a resurgence in recent years.

As of 16 Jun 2014, there have been 174 reported cases of whooping cough in Tarrant County, roughly the same number of cases recorded by this time in 2013. Health officials believe that the number of cases could get higher once current possible cases are vetted.

Tarrant County is not the only region with a high number of whooping cough cases. The highly infectious bacterial disease, which can be spread by coughing, has reached epidemic levels in California, according to the California Health Department A record 700 cases were reported in 2013 in Tarrant County -- many of them were reported in infants.

The Eastern Shore [Accomack and Northampton counties] Health District and health care professionals throughout the Eastern Shore are urging residents to get vaccinated in the wake of an upsurge in cases of pertussis, or whooping cough, since late May 2014. "We had the 1st case -- that was in an infant -- and it quickly swelled to 10, and now we have 15 active investigations," said Dr David O Matson, director of the health district.

In comparison, only 3 cases of pertussis were diagnosed on the Eastern Shore in 2012 and one case was identified in 2013. Those recently diagnosed with pertussis on the Eastern Shore live from near the Maryland line in Accomack County to Cape Charles in Northampton County and range in age from 1 month to 50s, with the majority being infants. At least two have been hospitalized. There have been no deaths.
