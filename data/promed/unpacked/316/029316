Foot-and-mouth disease [FMD], which broke out at Kamutjonga village
in the Kavango Region last month [July 2008], has been detected in
animals in 2 other villages in the Mukwe constituency.

Another 25 animals have been diagnosed in Mwitjiku and Popa villages,
bringing the number of cases to 50. The 3 villages are within a 10 km
(6.2 mi) radius of each other.

The disease was confirmed on 31 Jul [2008] after it was initially
detected at Kamutjonga on 28 Jul [2008].

Permanent secretary (PS) for Agriculture, Water and Forestry Andrew
Ndishishi said on Monday [18 Aug 2008] the 1st round of inspections
of the cattle population in surrounding areas indicate that the
disease is confined to Mukwe constituency. However, the adjacent
Ndiyona constituency has also been designated part of the
contaminated zone, which means that all cloven-hoofed animals or
their products and other potentially infected commodities such as
grass will not be allowed out of the area.

Mwitjiku and Popa village are within the Western Caprivi Strip. Rundu
state veterinarian Dr Thompson Shuro said the source of the outbreak
in the village is also suspected to be buffalo that live in the area.

A vaccination campaign was launched on 4 Aug 2008 to control the
disease and has so far resulted in the vaccination of 11 000 out of a
total of 18 000 susceptible cattle in Mukwe constituency. Ndishishi
said the campaign was designed to minimise the spread and protect the
cattle population at risk. He urged farmers to present all their
animals for vaccination.

Dr Shuro said the revaccination campaign in the wake of the outbreak
has seen an increase in the number of animals being brought in. The
current number, he said, was twice the number brought for annual
vaccinations in July [2008].

As part of control measures to stop the spread of the disease, 3
roadblocks have been put up to stop the movement of material from the
infected area. Shuro said people are being discouraged from
slaughtering animals for fear of transmitting the disease.

The thriving business of thatched grass, from which Mukwe
constituents derive their livelihood, has also been stopped. Grass is
a route of transmission because livestock salivate on the grass when grazing.

While the movement of cloven-hoofed animals and their products into
and out of the Kavango Region is not permitted, movement restrictions
in the rest of the northern communal areas have been relaxed to allow
livestock movement [to be slaughtered] for funerals, weddings, and
[for] marketing.

"The movements from region to region in Oshikoto, Ohangwena, Omusati,
Oshana, and Kunene are allowed under a veterinary permit issued by
veterinary officials in the respective regions for inspection of the
animals at designated points," said the PS.

While quarantine farms in Kavango and Caprivi remain closed and no
animals from the 2 regions may go to export abattoirs, restrictions
on movements of cattle to destined quarantine farms in the 4 other
regions have been lifted subject to a veterinary movement permit.

Restrictions on devil's claw and heat wood have also been lifted,
although their movement will be allowed if accompanied by a veterinary permit.

The list of designated inspection points in the different regions are
Opuwo, Okangwati, Sesfontein, Etanga, and Omakange in Kunene Region,
the Okahao-Oshakati Road at the Elim T-junction, on the
Ruacana-Oshakati Road at Onampila east of Oshikuku, close to the
border with Oshana, and Ombalantu livestock market in Omusati.

In Oshikoto Region, the inspection points are Casablanca, Omuthiya,
Onethindi, Onyati, and Okapya, while in Oshana, farmers can take
their animals for inspections to Ondangwa and Oshakati livestock markets.

In Ohangwena, the designated inspections points include Okongo,
Onambutu, Ondombe, Edundja, Ongenga, Ongha, Oshikunde, and Ongwelume.

[In order to enable export of animals or their products from
countries which are not FMD-free without vaccination, the OIE (World
Organisation for Animal Health) has developed a system by which such
countries can declare that they maintain a zone, within their
boundaries, which is FMD-free without vaccination. Exports from such
zones are subsequently allowed to FMD-free countries.

According to article 2.2.10.4 of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code
(<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/mcode/en_chapitre_2.2.10.htm>), an
FMD free zone where vaccination is not practised can be established
in either an FMD free country where vaccination is practised or in a
country of which parts are infected. Susceptible animals in the FMD
free zone should be separated by a buffer zone or by
physical/geographical barriers from the rest of the country and from
neighboring countries if they are of a different animal health
status, and animal health measures that effectively prevent the entry
of the virus should be implemented.

At present, 9 member-countries are officially recognized as "having
an FMD free zone where vaccination is not practised, according to the
provisions of Chapter 2.2.10 of the Terrestrial Code." Namibia is one
of these countries; the FMD-free zone was "designated by the Delegate
of Namibia in a document addressed to the Director General in
February 1997." Namibia's neighbors, Botswana and South Africa, have
a similar status.

On 4 Aug 2008, Namibia notified an outbreak of FMD to the OIE. The
outbreak affected cattle in an area close to a national park where
there are African Buffaloes. A follow-up report was submitted on 17
Aug 2008, addressing 2 additional outbreaks in Kavango, providing
information on the vaccine used (trivalent -- SAT1, SAT2, SAT3). No
serotyping of the involved virus is mentioned. For further details,
including epidemiological data and map, see
