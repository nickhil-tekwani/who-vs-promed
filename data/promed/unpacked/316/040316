[Telenesti is in central Moldova; see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telene%C8%99ti and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telene%C8%99ti_District. Zgardesti is to the west of the raion (district) capital.

This is a typical case of cutaneous anthrax. The news report is brief, but there is a hint that other animals in the village might have been affected. If so, we may well see further human cases among the villagers. With thanks to Sabine. - Mod.MHJ
