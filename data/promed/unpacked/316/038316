Spuds on the move again
-------------------------------------------
Mexico opens up; Korea free trade agreement applauded.
Idaho potato shipments are again moving to Mexico a year after the
discovery of potato cyst nematodes (PCN) in a handful of Eastern
Idaho fields shut down all international trade for the state's most
famous produce. The border opened last week as 2 truckloads of Idaho
potatoes crossed into Mexico, said Bob Hansen, manager of the
Idaho-Eastern Oregon Potato Committee. His office oversees the
federal marketing order for potatoes.
The shipments were accepted after Idaho met all requirements. Among
them: Fields in which the shipped potatoes are to be grown must be
tested and found free of PCN before the crop is planted. "Some fields
were tested last year and we were able to meet the requirements,"
Hansen said. "Idaho potatoes are very popular in Mexico. We were
doing really well down there until the PCN find shut us out. Now
we're back in the market. This can really make a difference for Idaho."
In other trade developments, Canada has removed its prohibition for
the importation of nursery stock from Idaho, provided that all plants
come from outside the regulated area where fields have tested
positive for PCN, according to the Idaho State Department of
Agriculture (ISDA). Canada and the United States have entered into an
agreement for importing and exporting seed potatoes, based on a
specific protocol for survey and certification, ISDA said in a
stakeholder update issued March 28 [2007].
Idaho seed potatoes from outside the regulated area are eligible for
export if they meet protocol requirements. Potatoes for consumption
may be exported to Canada from both within and outside the regulated
area, the update said.
Japan reopened its market after temporarily suspending importation of
all varieties of chipping potatoes from the United States in April
2006, when PCN was first found. However, potatoes may only be shipped
from 13 selected states. They must come from fields certified free of
PCN prior to export, and all potatoes must be washed before being
shipped, the ISDA update said. Idaho must complete a comprehensive
PCN survey before it will be eligible to export chipping potatoes to
Japan, and all U.S. chipping potatoes exported to Japan must be grown
from seed potatoes produced outside of Idaho.
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) will continue
working with Idaho and Japan to allow export of chipping potatoes
from Idaho and the use of Idaho seed in crops being shipped, the
statement continued. Korea still prohibits importing Idaho potatoes
due to PCN, the ISDA said.
U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service and ISDA are still working together to identify
the source of PCN and contain the infestation, according to the
update. More than 90 percent of the 2006 Idaho certified seed potato
crop was surveyed and found negative for PCN. Imported farm
equipment, nursery stock, foreign flower bulbs and other soil-bearing
items were also investigated without providing any leads as to the
origin of the infestation. A plan is being developed for a statewide
survey, the update said.
All fields found positive for PCN are under federal restrictions. No
more potatoes will be planted in those fields, and no soil can be
allowed to leave them. All equipment must be cleaned, the statement
said. A surrounding regulated area is restricted for the movement of
soil and other articles that could spread PCN. ISDA and USDA-APHIS
have agreed on a program to treat fields that tested positive for the
pest. Growers will be asked to enter into an agreement with the PCN
project to accomplish these activities, including access, tilling,
irrigation and planting.
PCN was found at an ISDA grading facility in Eastern Idaho in April
2006, during a routine survey. Canada, Mexico and Korea shut off
importation of Idaho potatoes at that time while Japan stopped all
U.S. potato imports. From June through October of last year, soil
samples identified seven fields in northern Bingham County that
tested positive for PCN. More than 38 000 samples were taken in 2006,
involving 224 production fields, 459 seed potato fields and 58
facilities. All were negative except for the samples from the 7
specific fields, the update said. Additional surveillance will
continue, ISDA said.

[Thank you to A. Dodds for this update on a continuing story. The
outbreak in Idaho was reported as pale cyst nematode _Globodera
pallida_. This nematode may cause crop losses as high as 70 percent
under poor management and it is classed as a very high risk to potato
producing areas. Spread occurs via soil, plant debris and infected
potato tubers. Potato golden cyst nematode (_Globodera
rostochiensis_) has a similarly high impact. It is spread in much the
same way but so far occurs only at a few sites in North America.
