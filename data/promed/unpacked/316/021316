Scots Face Greater Risk From Variant CJD?
-----------------------------------------
Scots emerged last night as marginally more at risk of falling victim to
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated as vCJD of CJD (new
var.) than people living in other parts of the United Kingdom. The
latest figures from the Government CJD surveillance Unit in Edinburgh
confirm a north-south divide, with those living in the North of
England, the North-west of England, and Wales having, with Scots, the
highest death rates from vCJD.
However, the overall figures contained in the Annual Report of the
CJD Surveillance Unit, due for publication next week, remain tiny. So
far, 15 Scots have died from the disease -- a death rate of 0.51 per
million per year. This compares with 0.50 for the North of England,
0.38 for the North-west of England and 0.36 for Wales -- but only 0.25
for the South-east of England and 0.30 for the West Midlands.
A Department of Health spokesman said the report drew no firm
conclusions from work carried out over the past year, and was
"inconclusive" about links with different types of food products. He
said that the report looked at theories suggesting that the cheaper cuts
of meat, pies, and sausages may have been a higher risk factor, but said
that there was no firm evidence.
He ruled out claims that the age of victims was falling, which would
have pointed to the [continued consumption of "mechanically
recovered" meat, which might have contained particles from spinal
cord most at risk of carrying the prions associated with the disease. He
said that the [average age remained 28, with the bulk of the cases
between 20 and 35, although 4 children under the age of 16 are among
the latest victims.
The report does suggest that the number of victims is accelerating ,
with 16 cases so far this year compared with 28 for the whole of the
year 2000.
