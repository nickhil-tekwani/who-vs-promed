NAIROBI, Kenya.
Fourteen people were reported dead Monday as an outbreak, believed to be
cholera, spread through a sprawling slum in Nairobi, sparking panic among
residents. Reporting this Tuesday, the Kenya News Agency said most of the
victims died over the past week. A medical official at a private clinic in
the area confirmed the outbreak adding that one man died Monday while he
was being treated at the facility.
A victim, Josephine Achieng, said she became ill Monday and was rushed to
the clinic
where she was treated and discharged. She had complained of vomiting and
diarrhoea. She claimed the victims were not getting proper attention and
were being turned away at the giant referral Kenyatta National Hospital due
to the on going nurses strike.
Residents said they feared the disease might spread rapidly as a result of
poor sanitation in the area of close to half a million inhabitants.
Other reports indicate that at least 12 people have died in Garissa District,
north-eastern Kenya, over the past two days following an outbreak of
diarrhoea.
Hundreds of families have also been rendered homeless and thousands of
livestock, the livelihood of the nomadic inhabitants of the province, have
been killed by ranging
floods, which have swept through the region in the past months. The region
has been completely cut off from the rest of the country, with roads being
swept away by seasonal rivers.
