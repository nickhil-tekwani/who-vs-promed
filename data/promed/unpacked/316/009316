4 more provinces report bird flu outbreaks
---------------------------------------------
Bird flu continues to spread throughout the country, with the latest
outbreaks reported in Vinh Long, Dak Lak and Hai Phong provinces. Last
Saturday [22 Jan 2005], bird flu recurred in an additional 23 communes in 9
cities and provinces, with sick and dead poultry now numbering more than 50
000.
In the Central Highlands province of Dak Lak, the outbreak was reported in
a poultry breeding farm in Krong Nang district, with nearly 100 poultry
head dead or destroyed.
Meanwhile, more than 200 sick ducks and chickens at a poultry breeding farm
in Tan Phong commune, Thuy Nguyen district, in northern Hai Phong city,
were killed after showing signs of bird flu symptoms.
Southern Soc Trang province has also reported the 1st outbreak in My Xuyen
district since the flu recurred in the Mekong River Delta nearly a month
ago [December 2004]. Test samples taken from a local farmer's flock of 18
chickens proved positive to avian H5 type A virus. Other test samples on 4
flocks of ducks in My Xuyen and Thanh Tri districts were also positive to H5.
In Quang Nam province, the flu is spreading to 7 communes and wards of 6
districts along National Highway 1A. The province has established 2
checkpoints along the highway and other mobile checkpoints at affected
districts. Local veterinary agencies encouraged farmers to co-ordinate in
destroying sick and dead poultry. Heavy fines will be handed out to those
who violate regulations on food hygiene and safety.
According to Nguyen Van Dzung, head of the steering board on bird flu
control of Hoi An town, local farmers are following the instructions and
regulations issued by the city. The city has also sealed off unaffected
areas to protect healthy poultry.
Dead poultry have been also reported in Da Nang city in the past 2 weeks.
90 percent of a farmer's chickens in An Hai Tay, Son Tra district died, and
he buried them on land in front of his house without any treatment.
Meanwhile, thousands of households in Tien Giang, Long An, Can Tho and Bac
Lieu provinces are suffering from heavy losses, after the flu hit the
Mekong River Delta. Activity at the poultry market seemed to grind to a
halt, although the situation is still considered under control. None of
these provinces have announced the epidemic yet.
The Hanoi Medical Department on Sunday [23 Jan 2005] inspected food hygiene
and safety conditions at several big markets. No violations were reported.
Le Anh Tuan, director of the department, said checked chicken will be soon
sold at markets and supermarkets to ensure sufficient supply of poultry
products for local people as the traditional Lunar New Year Festival
approaches. Accordingly, a specific slaughterhouse will be established at
each market, and its operations will be strictly monitored.
Chairman of the Hanoi People's Committee Nguyen Quoc Trieu, on Monday [24
Jan 2005], visited Hom and Long Bien markets, 2 of the largest markets in
Hanoi, to check bird flu control activities.
Mr. Trieu said that Hom and Long Bien are the 2 markets which consume the
highest number of chickens. The veterinary sector, therefore, must closely
co-operate with the market management board to strictly monitor the
transport of chickens to the markets. He called for greater efforts from
all agencies to contain the avian flu, particularly as people prepare for
the upcoming Lunar New Year festival 2005.
The Director of Ho Chi Minh City's Veterinary Department said that it is
safe for locals to use quarantined chickens.
The department is planning to make a list of "safe chicken centers." The
list will be made public so that people can feel safe to buy chickens in
the identified centers.

[Since its initial emergency report to the OIE regarding the 1st recorded
HPAI outbreak, on 9 Jan 2004, Viet Nam has sent 12 follow-up reports; 11 of
them during 2004: 30 Jan, 27 Feb, 19 Mar, 14 May, 2 Jul, 16 Jul, 23 Jul, 24
Sep, 22 Oct, 26 Nov and 24 Dec 2004. A single report has, so far, been
received by the OIE in 2005; this was the 12th follow-up report, sent 4
Jan, circulated 7 Jan 2005. All said reports can be seen in OIE's last (21
Jan 2005) Update on Avian Influenza in Animals in Asia (type H5) at
<http://oie.int/downld/AVIAN%20INFLUENZA/A_AI-Asia.htm>.
The disease continues its renewed, enhanced spread in Viet Nam. It would
have been easier to follow the spread meticulously if the official
reporting had become less sporadic. - Mod.AS]
