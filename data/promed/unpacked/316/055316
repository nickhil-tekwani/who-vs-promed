Highly pathogenic avian influenza, Japan
----------------------------------------
Information received on 20 Dec 2010 from Dr Toshiro Kawashima, CVO,
Animal Health Division, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries, Tokyo, Japan

(advanced), Necropsy
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks
Outbreak 1 Takaoka kojo (Old Castle) Park Zoo, Kojo, Takaoka city, Toyama
Date of start of the outbreak 16 Dec 2010
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Not applicable
Species Wild species
Susceptible 14
Cases 4
Deaths 4
Destroyed 10
Slaughtered 0
Affected Population: Captive wild birds 10 mute swans (4 mute swans
died) 2 ducks 2 black swans

Epidemiology - Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection.
Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments -- It is confirmed on 19 Dec 2010 that a
captive wild mute swan (Cygnus olor) in Toyama prefecture was infected
with HPAI. On 16 Dec 2010, a staff member of the Takaoka Old Castle
Park Zoo discovered 2 dead mute swans in a moat. The local veterinary
service centre in the prefecture confirmed a sample taken from the
dead birds was influenza A virus positive by antigen-capture kits on
the same day. On 19 Dec 2010, the National Institute of Animal Health
affirmed by HI test that the case was due to influenza A virus subtype
H5 and found that the amino acid sequence of the connecting peptide of
the haemagglutinin was the same as known highly pathogenic avian
influenza.

Neuraminidase inhibition assay are being carried out. On 20 Dec 2010,
the institute confirmed the case as highly pathogenic avian influenza
because the isolate caused 75 percent mortality in 4-week-old chickens
infected intravenously. The isolate is a closely-related strain to the
viruses isolated from faeces of migratory wild ducks in Hokkaido in
October 2010 and the cases that occurred in Shimane prefecture in
November 2010. The zoo destroyed all captive wild birds kept in the
moat for its own protection on 18 Dec 2010. Although a total of 4 dead
birds were found, 3 of them were negative by antigen-capture kits.

Control measures - Measures applied. Stamping out; Disinfection of
infected premises/establishment(s); Vaccination prohibited; No
treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied - No other measures

[The outbreak earlier this month was on a commercial poultry farm and
the previous one in 2008 was in wild birds. I guess this completes the
trifecta as zoo birds -- mute swans, black swans and ducks are
involved here. In South Korea this year, HPAI H5N1 has been found in
wild birds and a commercial duck farm as well.

Having a highly pathogenic H5 avian influenza virus at a zoo is
problematic. Zoo collections are valuable, assembled sometimes at
significant effort and cost and can sometimes contain protected
species. Thus, it is highly problematic when zoo birds must be culled
as has occurred with the 10 surviving birds here. - Mod.PC]

[The information is somewhat confused. In the beginning, it says 2
dead mute swans were found. Later it says there were 4 dead birds all
together, of which 3 tested negative for HPAI H5 -- so what did they
die of? That left 10 surviving birds, which were culled. That makes
sense, since the positive mute swan would have contaminated the moat
with its faeces, potentially infecting any bird swimming there.
