["Sheep pox and goat pox are viral diseases of sheep and goats characterised by fever, generalised papules or nodules, vesicles (rarely), internal lesions (particularly in the lungs), and death. Both diseases are caused by strains of capripoxvirus, all of which can infect sheep and goats. Although most of the strains examined cause more severe clinical disease in either sheep or goats, some strains have been isolated that are equally pathogenic in both species.

"Sheeppox virus (SPPV) and goatpox virus (GTPV) are the causative agents of sheep pox and goat pox, and with lumpy skin disease virus make up the genus Capripoxvirus in the family Poxviridae. Sheep pox and goat pox are endemic in Africa north of the Equator, the Middle East and Asia, while some parts of Europe have experienced outbreaks recently. Countries that reported outbreaks of the disease between 2010 and 2015 include Bulgaria, Chinese Taipei, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Morocco, Greece and Russia, with Greece, Israel and Russia having experienced recurring incidences.

"Live and inactivated vaccines have been used for the control of capripox. All strains of capripoxvirus so far examined share a major neutralisation site and some will cross protect. Inactivated vaccines give, at best, only short-term immunity."
