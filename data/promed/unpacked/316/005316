Chronic Wasting Case Found in Minnesota
----------------------------------------------
Animal-health officials confirmed Minnesota's first case of chronic wasting
Disease (CWD) on Fri 30 Aug 2002, marking the spread of the incurable
illness into a 10th state.
The state Board of Animal Health said a farm-raised elk tested positive
after dying mysteriously. The rest of the Aitkin County herd has been
quarantined. Officials said they didn't know the source of the infection.
They didn't say how many animals were in the herd.
CWD destroys the brain in deer, elk, moose, and caribou and causes the
animal to grow thin and die. Once found just in a small area of Colorado and
Wyoming, the illness has spread through elk ranches and wild deer and elk
herds as far away as Wisconsin.
In efforts to contain the disease, thousands of captive elk have been
slaughtered in Colorado and thousands of deer have been killed in Wisconsin.
The disease has also been found in New Mexico, South Dakota, Nebraska,
Montana, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Canada.
On Wed 28 Aug 2002, Wisconsin Gov. Scott McCallum told federal officials a
third of hunters could skip this season over fears about the safety of deer
meat, jeopardizing his state's battle to control the disease. McCallum sent
a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman urging her agency to "get
off the dime" and approve a rapid test for the disease and certify private
laboratories so they can also do testing.
Though experts say there is no evidence CWD can infect humans, the World
Health Organization (WHO) warns against eating any part of a deer with signs
of the disease.
Health officials in Minnesota and Wisconsin, meanwhile, have been working
with the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to
investigate the deaths of 3 men, 2 from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and
the other from Pick's disease, another neurological disorder. The men, 2
from Wisconsin and from Minnesota, knew each another and ate at wild-game
feasts hosted by one of them.
The cases have attracted attention because of concerns CWD disease could
eventually show up in humans [in the form of] Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
Both are in a family of diseases called spongiform encephalopathies. Mad-cow
disease (BSE, Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy), the version of the illness
affecting cattle, did jump the species barrier in Europe and killed people.
