Pasco County Animal Services is suspending dog adoptions, intakes, transfers, and surgeries because of the highly contagious canine pneumovirus. The temporary shutdown does not affect adoptions or other activities for cats.

Canine pneumovirus causes respiratory disease in dogs and is difficult to control in kennels. The Land O' Lakes shelter could resume normal operations in about 2 weeks or when veterinarians determine the environment is safe for pets, the county said in a released statement.

"The health and safety of the animals in our care, as well as people and pets in our community, is and will always be our top priority," said Animal Service Director Mike Shumate. "We realize this suspension of services is an inconvenience for our customers, and we appreciate your understanding."

The county staff also will be contacting people who recently adopted dogs from the shelter. If a pet shows symptoms such as sneezing, watery eyes, runny nose, and coughing, owners should contact a veterinarian immediately.

["Canine pneumovirus was first isolated in 2010 from dogs with respiratory disease in the United States. Since then, seropositive dogs have been detected in Europe, Africa, and Asia with genomic sequences determined from samples in England and Italy. Seronegative dogs entering animal shelters quickly seroconvert with a strong correlation between exposure to canine pneumovirus and the development of respiratory disease. These observations indicate canine pneumovirus contributes to what is commonly referred to as the canine infectious respiratory disease complex [CIRDC]. The canine virus is very closely related to pneumonia virus of mice.

"Infection of mice with the canine virus produced a mild pneumonia and recovered mice were protected from a lethal challenge with pneumonia virus of mice. Pneumovirus has also been isolated from cats, and several wildlife species (raccoons and foxes) show a high seroprevalence for the canine virus. These data call into question whether rodents are a natural host for pneumovirus as wild rodents show little or no exposure to pneumovirus. Canine pneumovirus is difficult to isolate in cell cultures, and many laboratories offer PCR panels that include canine pneumovirus."

"Canine pneumovirus contributes to what is commonly referred to as the canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC). Clinical signs of CIRDC may include sneezing, nasal and ocular discharge, and sometimes lower respiratory and/or systemic disease.

"Viral pathogens associated with CIRDC in dogs include:
- parainfluenza
- adenovirus-2
- respiratory coronavirus (this is distinct from canine enteric coronavirus)
- herpesvirus-1
- pneumovirus"
- and other respiratory syncytial viruses, mentioned above

"Bacterial pathogens implicated in CIRDC include:
- _Bordetella bronchiseptica_
- _Mycoplasma_ spp.
- _Streptococcus zooepidemicus_ (may cause severe systemic disease)"

If your pet is listless, depressed, having difficulty breathing, and possibly not eating/drinking well, it is advisable to have your pet seen by a veterinarian as soon as possible.

Early treatment can help, as can prevention methods of vaccines to help protect your pet. While there is not currently a vaccine for this virus, there are some vaccines associated with respiratory diseases that may reduce and/or prevent the clinical signs of this disease.
