[This viral disease of the common as well as
other types of carp was first diagnosed in the
United States in 2002. It has been recognized for
over 50 years in Europe, occurring commonly in
the Middle East and Asia as well. It can have a
substantial impact on production, killing up to
70 percent of young carp. A very nice technical
note can be found on the USDA-APHIS website:
