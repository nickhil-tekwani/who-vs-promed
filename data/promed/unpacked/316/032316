South Africa has recorded a surge in measles cases, with the Northern Cape Province topping the list, warned the National Institute for Communicable Diseases. "Over the past 2 months, there has been an increase in laboratory-confirmed (IgM positive) measles cases." The 5 provinces affected are Gauteng, Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal, Northern Cape and Western Cape.

Sporadic laboratory-confirmed measles cases have also been noted in the Eastern Cape and Free State. "No laboratory-confirmed measles cases have been reported from Limpopo and Northwest provinces during 2014 to date."

The National Institute for Communicable Diseases says you should look out for these signs:

- High fever, rising over 3 days to 39 to 40.5 C [102-104.9 F]
- Runny nose
- A harsh, dry cough
- Red, inflamed eyes (conjunctivitis) and aversion to bright light

There has been an increase in laboratory-confirmed measles cases in Gauteng and 4 other provinces. The National Institute for Communicable Diseases said the Northern Cape [province] has reported the highest increase with 5 laboratory-confirmed measles cases detected within a 4-week period in the Siyanda District Municipality.

The Northern Cape health department [NICD] has reportedly initiated an investigation in the Siyanda District Municipality and was taking steps to help curb the outbreak. The NICD advised parents to look out for fevers rising over 3 days, a runny nose, dry cough and eyes that have turned red and become sensitive to light. Children should be taken to a clinic as soon as parents suspect that they might have contracted measles, the NICD added.

In Gauteng, there have been more than 400 confirmed cases of measles since March 2009, according to the provincial health department. In October 2009, the department embarked on a massive measles immunisation campaign in response to the confirmed cases in the province. This campaign was reportedly aimed at targeting children from the ages of 6 months up to both primary and high schools learners. Health workers visited clinics, schools and creches throughout the province for immunisation.

Measles is a highly contagious but less lethal viral disease that spreads through droplets of saliva and secretions from the nose, the department said. Last year [2013], the department immunised most children during the 1st round of a measles and polio campaign which ran from 29 Apr to 17 May 2014. The province exceeded the target of the number of children who received measles vaccine and reached 102 percent, said the department.

Following the recent confirmation of several measles cases in the Traverse City area, the Michigan Department of Community Health is reminding residents across the state to protect themselves against the disease by ensuring they're up to date on their vaccines.

Michigan is now among 23 states that have reported cases of measles this year [2014]. Two Michigan cases were unvaccinated, with the patients exposed to measles during travel in the Philippines. The other 3 involved unvaccinated residents coming into contact with the people who had contracted the disease while traveling.

From 2001-2012, the average number of measles cases reported nationally each year was 60. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there have been more than 600 cases reported this year [2014] in the US, and the vast majority of cases have been among people who had no history of vaccination against measles.

The Philippines is experiencing a large and ongoing measles outbreak, with more than 50 000 measles cases and more than 100 measles-related deaths reported this year [2014]. Many of the cases in the U.S. this year have been traced to travel in or contact with the Philippines.

Measles is a disease that can result in hospitalization, pneumonia, and death. Because measles is highly contagious, successful prevention and control require high levels of immunity in all communities. The disease is preventable by simply being vaccinated.

There are now 5 confirmed cases of measles in Grand Traverse and Leeland counties, health officials reported on Wed 10 Dec 2014.

On Thu 4 Dec 2014, the Grand Traverse County Health Department reported there were 2 adult cases in the county involving unimmunized people who recently had returned from the Philippines. The 3 new cases involve an adult and 2 children, all not immunized, from Leeland County. They had contact with the Grand Traverse adults. "The children did not attend school during the infectious period," according to the joint press release from the Grand Traverse and Benzie-Leeland health department, who are not releasing the name of the school.

Nearly 45 percent of Michigan residents now live in counties at risk of disease outbreaks, according to an MLive analysis of state data. Michigan has one of the highest vaccine-waiver rates for kindergartners in the country, 3 times the national median, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

After the 1st 2 cases last week, health officials sent out an urgent message for people to get vaccinated. Dr. Michael Collins, chief medical officer for the county health department, described the disease as extraordinarily contagious with the potential to cause serious complications, even death. Several others who were exposed to the 1st adults with measles and are not immunized are being actively monitored for development of symptoms and isolated in their homes for 21 days. Those having contacts with the Leeland cases are also being investigated to determine vaccinated or immunity status and are being isolated as well. "The situation is a fluid one, but at this time, there is no indication that anyone, in any age group, was in any of the school buildings during their infectious periods. If there is a case within a school, all unimmunized children will need to be excluded from that school for many days (21 days from the last case appearing in the school)."

The 1st 2 people affected by measles are 19 and 22 years old. They returned on 17 Nov 2014 from a trip to the Philippines, where there is a major measles outbreak. They were hospitalized with measles on 26 Nov 2014 but have recovered and been discharged from the hospital, according to Dr. Collins.

The number of measles cases and deaths in the Philippines rose by 1578 and 5, respectively, during the month of November, according to data from the World Health Organization's Measles-Rubella Bulletin for November 2014. The number of suspected and confirmed cases reached 55 388, up from 53 810 one month previously. In addition, the number of deaths due to measles went from 102 to 107 during the same period.

Elsewhere in the Western Pacific Region, the WHO reports that China has topped 100 000 suspected and confirmed cases, currently at 103 375. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports from that from 1 Jan to 31 Oct 2014, there have been 603 confirmed measles cases reported to CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD). This is the highest number of cases since measles elimination was documented in the U.S. in 2000. In addition, the federal health agency says many of the cases in the U.S. in 2014 have been associated with cases brought in from the Philippines. CDC recommends that travelers to the Philippines protect themselves by making sure they are vaccinated against measles, particularly infants 6-11 months of age (1 dose of measles vaccine) and children 12 months of age or older (2 doses of measles vaccine). Clinicians should keep measles in mind when treating patients with fever and rash, especially if the patient has recently traveled internationally.

Measles or rubeola, is an acute highly communicable viral disease that is characterized by Koplik spots in the cheek or tongue very early in the disease. A couple of days later, a red blotchy rash appears, 1st on the face, and then spreads, lasting 4-7 days. Other symptoms include fever, cough and red watery eyes. The patient may be contagious from 4 days prior to the rash appearance to 4 days after rash appearance. The disease is more severe in infants and adults. Complications from measles are reported in up to 20 percent of people.

Measles outbreak in Greater Manchester, England, October 2012 to September 2013: epidemiology and control. By Pegorie M, Shankar K, Welfare WS, Wilson RW, Khiroya C, Munslow G, Fiefield D, Bothra V, McCann R. Euro Surveill. 2014;19(49):pii=20982.

Synopsis: This publication describes the epidemiology and management of a prolonged outbreak of measles across the 2.7 million conurbation of Greater Manchester in the United Kingdom. Over a period of one year (from October 2012 to September 2013), over 1000 suspected measles cases (n=1073) were notified across Greater Manchester; of these, 395 (37 percent) were laboratory-confirmed, 91 (8 percent) were classed as probable, 312 (29 percent) were classed as possible and 275 (26 percent) excluded. Most confirmed and probable cases occurred in children within 2 age groups: infants (too young to be eligible for measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination according to the national immunisation programme) and children aged 10-19 years (low vaccine uptake in this cohort because of unfounded alleged links between the MMR vaccine and autism). During this one year period, there were a series of local outbreaks, and many of these occurred within the secondary school setting. A series of public health measures were taken to control this prolonged outbreak: setting up incident management teams to control local outbreaks; a concerted immunisation catch-up campaign (initially local then national) to reduce the pool of children partially or totally unprotected against measles; and the exclusion of close contacts from nurseries and school settings for a period of 10 days following the last exposure to a case of measles.

[Among much else, the authors conclude that: The descriptive epidemiology of this outbreak was consistent with multiple introductions of measles into partially susceptible communities resulting in a series of discrete outbreaks rather than Greater Manchester-wide transmission. Some local authorities had localised outbreaks, often amplified and maintained in educational settings, in particular secondary schools, reflecting known cohorts of low coverage. This was demonstrated by the social network diagrams and the age groups affected.
