A dengue fever outbreak has been reported in Mombasa, Kenya. The 1st laboratory confirmed case was reported by Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) on 7 Mar 2013. However, a retrospective review of hospital records indicates that the 1st case was confirmed in a private laboratory on 7 Jan 2013. From this review, there were 3 cases in January and 2 cases in February [2013] that had been confirmed in private laboratories but this information was not reported to the Ministry of Health until late February 2013.

As of 26 Apr 2013, 83 of 148 (56 per cent) blood samples collected from residents of Mombasa who visited health facilities with dengue-like illness have tested positive for dengue virus (DENV) infection by RT-PCR. Identified DENV types include DENV-1 (69 per cent), DENV-2 (28 per cent), and DENV-3 (3 per cent); at least one sample was positive for 2 DENV serotypes (DENV-1 and 2). Age range for confirmed cases was 12-56 years old with a median of 34; 56 per cent were male. No dengue associated deaths have been reported to date.

This is the 1st identified dengue outbreak in Mombasa since 1982. Mombasa is a major metropolitan city (2nd largest city in Kenya) along the coast in Kenya and a major shipping port and international/local tourist destination. This is the 2nd town in Kenya to have reported cases of dengue since 2011; cases were reported in Mandera town in North Eastern Kenya in September 2011 (1300 cases) and again in January 2013 (190 cases). The Mandera outbreak has since been contained.

As a response to controlling the outbreak, the Ministry of Health has embarked on a number of activities. A team from the Division of Disease Surveillance and Response (DDSR), Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (FELTP), KEMRI, and local staff from the Ministry of Health are responding to this outbreak with in-country technical support and assistance from US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Kenya (CDC-Kenya) and the US Army Medical Research Unit-Kenya (USAMRU-K). The response measures being conducted by this team include sensitization of health workers and community members, active case search, and vector control.

[ProMED-mail is very grateful to Dr Njeru and his colleagues in Kenya for this thorough and interesting report. Although the incidence of serious dengue or DHF is not mentioned in this outbreak, it is good to learn that there have been no fatalities.

There has been a long-standing debate about the presence or absence of clinical dengue in Africa. Several of the reports of dengue in Africa that have come to ProMED are individuals from European and other countries that were infected in Africa but became ill in their home countries. These reports indicated that dengue viruses were, indeed circulating in Africa. There has also been speculation that many dengue cases in Africa were misdiagnosed as malaria cases, resulting in significant underreporting of dengue cases. ProMED encourages submission of dengue reports from Sub-Saharan Africa in the future.
