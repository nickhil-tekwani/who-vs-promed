1st Report of the Stubby-Root Nematode, _Paratrichodorus teres_, from
Potato in the Columbia Basin of Washington State.

Stubby-root nematodes of the genus _Paratrichodorus_ are migratory
ectoparasites that cause stunted and deformed roots. They also transmit
Tobacco rattle virus, the causal agent of corky ringspot disease in potato.
Thus, they are important to the potato industry in the Pacific Northwest,
including the Columbia Basin of Washington state, which is one of the
largest potato-producing regions in the United States.

Stubby-root nematode species are difficult to identify because the
morphological differences between the species are very small (4).
_Paratrichodorus teres_ is a morphologically similar species and has been
reported mainly from temperate regions within Europe. _P. teres_ has also
been reported in potato fields in eastern Oregon (3). The morphological
similarity between _P. allius_ and _P. teres_ creates problems for routine
identification because trichodorid species have a conservative morphology
and are separated by the following primary characteristics: females, type
of genital system and vulva position; males, number of ventromedian
precloacal supplements and cervical papillae and habitus (2).

As with most soil nematodes, females are more prevalent than the males.
Unfortunately, in the generic key (2), female _P. allius_ and _P. teres_
belong to subgroup 1-12 and are separated by a secondary characteristic,
vaginal shape that could be affected by fixation or handling. Male _P.
allius_ and _P. teres_ are separated by the former species having one fewer
ventromedian precloacal supplement. Thus, the morphological similarity
between _P. allius_ and _P. teres_ creates problems for routine
identification. This might be one of the reasons that _P. teres_ has not
been diagnosed in Washington until now.

Using nematode morphological diagnostic keys (1,2) and comparing 18S rDNA
sequence data obtained from specimens with those listed on public sequence
databases, e.g., NCBI GenBank, stubby-root nematodes from 2 potato fields
close to Moses Lake, Grant County, WA, were diagnosed as _P. teres_. The 2
adjacent potato fields are irrigated and are situated approximately 100
miles from the eastern Oregon site where _P. teres_ was first described
(3). Soil samples were collected from several Columbia Basin potato fields
that had corky ringspot disease and stubby-root nematodes.

Corky ringspot disease is an emerging disease in Washington, and the
presence of a new viruliferous nematode species might be of concern to the
potato industry.

[Stubby root nematodes are becoming of increasing importance to the potato
industry in Washington State, because they are vectors of Tobacco rattle
virus (TRV), the causal agent of Corky Ringspot disease. In addition to the
presence of _Paratrichodorus allius_ (Pa) in Washington State, a 2nd
morphologically similar stubby root nematode species (_Paratrichodorus
teres_, Pt) has been identified. The current method for determining if the
nematodes are viruliferous for TRV takes several weeks, because it requires
a glasshouse bioassay. Therefore, a rapid molecular assay has been
developed using RT-PCR to identify viruliferous nematodes. The technique
can detect TRV in as few as 5 nematodes.

Corky ringspot disease (CRS) in potatoes is caused by tobacco rattle virus
(TRV), which is vectored by stubby root nematode species
(_Paratrichondorus_, _Tricondorus_ spp.). Both virus and vector have wide
host ranges, leading to persistence of the disease in spite of the use of
expensive chemical control agents.

Use of resistant varieties can be a key factor for managing this disease.
However, it is difficult to confirm resistance of parents and selected
progeny genotypes due to erratic incidence and symptom expression in field
screening plots. Screening nurseries require many replications and large
plots, but escapes are still common.

Recent work at Scottish Crop Research Institute (SCRI) (_Xenophontos_ et
al., (1998) Potato Research, 41, 255-265; Dale et al., (2000) European
Journal of Plant Pathology, 106, 275-282) has shown that some potato
cultivars, (Wilja and King Edward), can become persistently systemically
infected with TRV without developing spraing symptoms (reddish brown spots,
rings, or arcs in tuber tissue), and that such plants can serve as sources
for virus acquisition by vector nematodes. Stocks of these cultivars can
become chronically infected, and show effects on yield and quality, with
the production of smaller tubers with extensive secondary growth and growth
cracking. Preliminary experiments suggest that more cultivars than the 2
mentioned above are affected in this way.
