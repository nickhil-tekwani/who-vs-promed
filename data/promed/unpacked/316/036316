SURRA, EQUINE, CLINICAL ASSAY DEVELOPMENT
*****************************************
A ProMED-mail post

From: Dr. Tom Morton <microbio@emirates.net.ae>

We are currently trying to evaluate, for use in horses, a number of
serological tests which have been developed for detection of
_Trypanosoma. evansi _ antigen and antibody in other species, mainly Camels
and Buffalo. In order to develop these tests for use in surveys and for
export purposes we need to calculate sensitivity, specificity, and
predictive value figures.
For the figures to have any significance we believe that we will need at
least 50 samples from known infected horses, that is, where _T. evansi_
has been positively identified in samples taken from the animal.
Clinical Surra is extremely rare in the U.A.E (only one recorded case in
the last 5-10 years) and obtaining a sufficient number of serum samples
locally is not possible. I therefore request help from colleagues in other
countries.
We would be grateful if anyone who is able to provide the type of samples
outlined above could contact Dr. Ulrich Wernery, Scientific Director,
Central Veterinary Research Laboratory, Dubai, U.A.E. Tel: (971) 4 375165
or Fax: (971) 4 368638.
