H7N9 case reported on Chinese mainland
-----------------------------------
Another H7N9 infection case was confirmed on the Chinese mainland last week, health authorities said on Monday. Between May 6 and May 13, one person, in east China's Jiangxi Province, was confirmed to have been infected with the new type of bird flu, according to the National Health and Family Planning Commission.

The virus has killed 35 people on the mainland, while 57 of those infected have recovered, the commission said.

Since the first human infections in the country in late March, China has reported 130 confirmed H7N9 cases.

The commission added that the confirmed cases were isolated and there was no sign of human-to-human transmission.

[3] Extent of poultry contact

Three more deaths from bird flu in China as toll reaches 35
--------------------------------------------------
As of Mon 13 May 2013 three more people have died in China from the new strain of H7N9 bird fluvirus, raising the death toll to 35 while the total number of infections rose to 130, state media said today. Without giving details of the deaths, the Xinhua news agency said a new case of the H7N9, described by the World Health Organisation as one of the most lethal flu viruses around, was found in China's east Jiangxi province.

There has so far been no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus, a point reiterated by Xinhua on Monday, citing health authorities. It noted that 57 of those infected have recovered. Chinese scientists say the virus has been transmitted to humans from chickens, though the World Health Organisation says 40 percent of people infected with H7N9 had no contact with poultry.

Since it was first detected in March, the H7N9 virus has raised alarm and pummeled Chinese demand for poultry as well as prices for livestock. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said the current strain of bird flu cannot start a pandemic but notes there is no guarantee it will not mutate and cause a serious pandemic.

[There is an increasing lack of consistency in the reporting of the numbers of human cases of avian A/(H7N9) influenza virus infection in China. The reported number of human cases varies from 130 to 135, irrespective of the source and date of reporting, and may or may not include the single case reported from Taiwan. The number of deaths is more consistent and has reached 35. The number of recovered patients is generally given as 57. Hopefully the downward trend in new cases will be a consistent observation. - Mod.CP
