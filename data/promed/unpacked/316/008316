Health authorities in Niger said Friday [15 Mar 2019] they had found a fake version of a meningitis vaccine after the country had launched a campaign to inoculate millions of children against the disease. In a statement, the health ministry asked doctors to be vigilant over a "counterfeit" version of a vaccine called Mencevax ACWY. The fake drug is marked as having been manufactured in December 2016, with an end-date for use by November 2021, it said.

Niger launched a week-long campaign on 5 Mar [2019] to vaccinate 6 million children against meningitis, which killed nearly 200 people 2 years ago. The country lies in the so-called "meningitis belt" stretching from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east, where outbreaks of the disease are a regular occurrence.

The vaccination programme is against meningitis A, one of the six groups of meningitis bacteria that can cause epidemics.

The ministry's spokesman told AFP the bogus drug had been discovered during a "routine inspection" of a privately-owned pharmacy in the capital, Niamey. An investigation is under way to try to ascertain how many of the fake vaccines have been used, the spokesman said.

Health workers administering meningitis jabs are being asked to take special care about their supply source, and the public are being urged to scrutinise vaccines clearly, even if they buy them in "licensed" pharmacies. Fake drugs -- medications that are outright counterfeits or whose active ingredients have been diluted -- are a major problem in West Africa. In the 2017 outbreak, and in an epidemic in 2015 in which nearly 500 people died, Niger sounded the alarm over purported vials of vaccine that just contained water.

Meningitis is transmitted between people through coughs and sneezes, close contact and cramped living conditions. The illness causes acute inflammation of the outer layers of the brain and spinal cord, with the most common symptoms being fever, headache and neck stiffness.

Niger health authorities said today [15 Mar 2019] that they had found a fake version of a meningitis vaccine after launching a vaccination campaign to inoculate 5 million children against the disease. The minister of public health, Dr Idi Illiassou Mainassara, said on 15 Mar 2019 that the bogus vaccine, Mencevax ACWY, had been discovered during a "routine inspection" in the Niger capital city of Niamey. In a statement, Dr Mainassara asked doctors to be vigilant over this "counterfeit" vaccine.

In December 2010, a new meningococcal A conjugate vaccine was introduced in Africa through mass campaigns targeting persons 1 to 29 years of age. As of November 2017, more than 280 million persons have been vaccinated in 21 African belt countries. The vaccine is remarkably safe and cheap. In addition, its thermostability allows its use under controlled temperature chain (CTC) conditions. Its impact on carriage and the reduction in disease and epidemics is significant: a 58% decline in meningitis incidence and a 60% decline in the risk of epidemics were described. It is now introduced into routine infant immunization.

Maintaining high coverage is expected to eliminate meningococcal A epidemics from this region of Africa. However, other meningococcal serogroups such as W, X, and C still cause epidemics, and around 30 000 cases are reported each year in the meningitis belt.

WHO is committed to eliminating meningococcal disease as a public health problem. Meningococcal meningitis is a bacterial form of meningitis, a serious infection of the thin lining that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Meningococcal meningitis is associated with high fatality (up to 50% when untreated) and high frequency (more than 10%) of severe sequelae. Early antibiotic treatment is the most important measure to save lives and reduce complications.

[The news reports above say that a fake meningococcal vaccine, Mencevax ACWY, marked as having been manufactured in December 2016, with an end-date for use by November 2021, was being distributed in Niamey, the capital of Niger. Mencevax ACWY is a lyophilized preparation of purified polysaccharides from _Neisseria meningitidis_ (meningococcus) of serogroups A, C, W and Y, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline that must be reconstituted with the sterile diluent that is supplied in another glass vial or pre-filled syringe for subcutaneous injection. However, we are not told whether Mencevax ACWY is the intended vaccine and, if so, how to distinguish the fake Mencevax ACWY from the correct one.

Use of fake vaccines will leave a substantial portion of the population susceptible to meningococcal disease and engender further loss of confidence in the utility of vaccines. It will also undermine public confidence in the ability of government to safeguard the public. - Mod.ML
