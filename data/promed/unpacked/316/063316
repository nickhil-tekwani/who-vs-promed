During surveys performed in apple orchards in Isparta province,
small, circular, brown-bordered, purplish-brown spots were seen on
apple leaves. The enlarging spots coalesced and became darker on some
apple cultivars. One fungus was repeatedly isolated from leaf samples
obtained from 6 different locations in the province. It formed dark
olive, circular, velvety colonies on PDA. Mycelia were septate, pale
brown and had an average diameter of 4.2 mm. Conidia, with an average
size of 20.6 x 9.25 mm, had both transverse and longitudinal septa
and a short false beak and were formed in long chains. The pathogen
was identified as _Alternaria mali_ [Am] (Bulajic et al., 1996;
Sawamura, 1990).
Pathogenicity of Am isolates was tested by inoculation with a
conidial suspension (1 million conidia per ml) on detached, wounded
apple leaves and on apple seedlings in orchards. Symptoms were
observed on detached leaves 3 days after incubation in a humidity
chamber at 25 deg C and were similar to those developing on leaves of
inoculated seedlings. Reisolations yielded the same fungus. In
addition, isolates were grown on Czapek-Dox medium for 6 days at same
temperature, without shaking. At the end of this period culture
filtrate was obtained and applied to the underside of wounded leaves
as described in Johnson et al., 2000. Necrotic spots were observed on
the leaves 24 hours after the inoculation. These results supported
the contention that Am causes disease by producing a specific toxin.
This is the 1st report of Alternaria necrotic leaf spot of apples
caused by Am in Turkey.

[Am is a common saprophyte (an organism capable of growth and
survival without the aid of another living organism) which can become
somewhat infectious to apple fruit that has been predisposed to
infection because of injury to the host. Common injuries that can
lead to Am rot include mechanical or chemical injury, sunscald, or
chilling. Infection can occur before or after harvest, although it is
more commonly a post-harvest problem. Am leaf spot is aggravated by
European red mites.
Disease management consists of mite control, application of
fungicides, and adequate tree spacing and other cultural practices
that enhance drying conditions. The disease is managed by avoiding
injury during harvest and packing. Additionally, post-harvest fruit
dips in chlorine solutions can help to prevent post-harvest disease
problems. Controlled cold storage is another good practice that will
reduce disease problems.
