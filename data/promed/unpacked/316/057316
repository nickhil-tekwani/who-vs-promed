The incidence of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in Stavropol
is 2 times higher than it was last year [2006]. The situation is
estimated by experts as unfavorable. Today [13 Jun 2007], there are 23
registered cases of CCHF in 12 districts of Stavropol: 5 cases in
Neftekumsk district, 4 in the Apansenkovsk region, 2 each in
Budenovskiy, Ipatovskiy, Krasnogvardeyskiy, Levokumskiy, and one each
in Aleksandrovskiy, Arzgirskiy, Blagodarnenskiy, Izobilnenskiy,
Kurskiy, and Novoselitskiy districts; 73 percent of the cases were
infected through contact with animals, 27 percent in natural
conditions (in the fields) -- 16 people were bitten by ticks, and 5
people had removed ticks with unprotected hands.
Experts are associating such high tick activity with the dry, hot
weather. A preliminary diagnosis of CCHF was made of 165 people
hospitalized in the region; that is 6 percent higher than the same
indicator for last year [2006]. A total of 3866 persons applied for
care due to tick bites, including 1512 children. It should be noted
that the number of children with tick bites has increased 10 percent
compared with last year [2006].
Experts and health officials have emphasized the importance of
treating summer camps for children and other recreational areas with
anti-tick solutions, as well as educating the population --
particularly those working in yards and dealing with animals -- about
the methods of protection against ticks.
