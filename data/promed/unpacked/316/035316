[Some weeks ago, I received the following comments to my advice about trying
to always burn anthrax carcasses, not to bury them. We, here, went through
our bibliography of some 2,600 papers on anthrax and there were none on
burning or incineration in that body of the world literature. MHJ

[This history demonstrates nicely how if one is not expecting anthrax it can
be readily missed. Please excuse the delays in posting this but ... I am
only just back from Kazakhstan. At the latter anthrax meeting evidence was
produced which clearly indicates that burying anthrax carcasses may be an
excellent way of ensuring future cases. Burning carcasses should be the
priority. MHJ

I just finished your anthrax report (New Mexico). I was disturbed by the
anonymous suggestion at the end that the infected carcasses be burned in
the future. My experience with Bacillus spores suggests that burning would
probably introduce viable spores into the air. This, I believe, would be
worse than burying the "infection". I'm sure some research has been done
in this regard and the person tagging that report with a suggestion ought
to look it up and justify their suggestion. Please pass this sentiment
along if possible.

[This type of comment is not unusual. I can remember it first when we were
burning FMD Infected herds on the Cheshire plain in England in 1967-68.
There is always the chance of an updraft throwing viable agents up into the
air. However the great majority are either killed or damaged by the heat,
and any surviving are widely dispersed and diluted. The decomposing
carcasses kill the vegetative _B. anthracis_ in the body through the rapid
acidification during putrefaction. Any spores are in the surface 0.5 - 1.0
cm (e.g. in the skin) and in the spilt blood via body orifices. The risk
from the latter is extremely variable. Unfortunately it is now clear from
careful spore counts of the grave-soil that when a carcass is buried and
the carcass was spore-laden, spores can eventually work their way to the
soil surface and may, in some instances, result in new livestock cases.
Burning of the carcass, and of the immediate contaminated soil, is a lesser
risk.
To get a hands-on appreciation of which is better, I asked Dan Dragon, who
is monitoring the 1993 epidemic at the Mackenzie Bison Range when some 150
out of the 171 Wood Bison anthrax deaths were burnt; a dozen were treated
with chemicals; and the remainder got left. His comments on this were: -

Brett [Elkins, NWT Wildlife Pathologist and I were discussing your email
of the 9th earlier this week. We both agree that burning is a superior
method for disposal of anthrax carcasses than burial and results in fewer
"risks" to animals and humans.
Neither method was ever meant as a means to sterilize an area after an
anthrax outbreak. Instead burial and burning were meant to minimize future
contact between humans & healthy animals and the infected carcass. From my
own travels around Hook Lake and Wood Buffalo National Park where burial of
carcasses was favored over burning, I have seen that buried carcasses are
still very much a part of the environment. [Such burials started in 1963
Raised anthrax mounds are the high points on an otherwise flat open field
and are commonly used by scavengers and carnivores as observation posts
(human hunters also use them as dry spots upon which to pitch their tents).
What's more the soft packed soil of the anthrax mound makes an excellent
excavation site for foxes and wolves to build their dens (the stored meat
below must also be appealing). Ants seem to favor the loose soil of the
mound for building huge new nests (if Pasteur was correct in his
observations about earthworms returning buried anthrax spores to the
surface then so could ants). The area of the mound itself and its immediate
surroundings, cleared of sedge and other vegetation, are apparently
attractive sites for bull bison to start new wallows at.
Burning, on the other hand, creates no such artificial observation
platforms and does not improve the site for scavengers looking for a new
home. The fire denudes the immediate area of vegetation, discouraging
herbivores from grazing. As you have seen, the nutrients from the carcass
fertilize the soil of a burn site, but the resulting plants are not major
feed items of the bison [nor so for cattle if they were there. Their
thick growth seems to prevent bison from forming new wallows on the site;
unlike with burial sites, I have never come across a wallow near a burn
site. Also when burning carcasses one does not have to worry as much about
the area's water table and seepage of spores away from the carcass.
Burning also presents [fewer risks for human clean-up crews than burial.
Logs and coal can be stacked on the carcass without disturbing it or the
surrounding soil and vegetation. Soaking the carcass with jet B fuel also
keeps down aerosolized particles and the fire can be started from a
distance. Burial requires heavy machinery to dig the pit and move the
carcass[es. The action of the machinery often raises large dust clouds
and, after burial is complete, the machinery must be disinfected. Of the
four cases of human anthrax known in northern Canada, three were in persons
who dissected a diseased bison carcass without adequate protective gear.
The fourth was in a back hoe operator who was helping to bury carcasses. He
was a chronic smoker, did not wear protective breathing apparatus and often
came down out of the back hoe between burials to clean the dirt from the
back hoe's shovel and tracks. He developed symptoms similar to inhalation
anthrax and luckily survived.
As far as the smoke cloud from a burning carcass carrying away lethal
plumes of anthrax spores, an animal carcass does not [a Sverdlosk make.
Most of the carcasses found in anthrax outbreaks in northern Canada are
still fairly well intact with the putrefaction process well underway. Spore
production from these carcasses should be fairly minimal. [The spores
present around the carcass would just as likely be aerosolized by
disturbance of the area for burial as by burning of the carcass, and would
only be dangerous to creatures within the immediate area (a smoke cloud
from a burning carcass quickly disperses and the concentration of spores
within would rapidly diminish). The major difference between the methods
would be the location of the clean-up personnel; with burial the personnel
would be within whatever [dust cloud was generated while with burning they
would be well away from the cloud.
This is not to say that burning is any easier than burying carcasses. On a
hot day, it's just as hard to dig a hole in the ground as it is to haul and
prepare a cord of wood for burning. Also during the 1993 MSB outbreak, at
least 28 of the disposal fires got away from the clean-up personnel and
created small forest fires (although Cormack [Gates liked to think of them
as "Bison Habitat Reclamation Exercises").
