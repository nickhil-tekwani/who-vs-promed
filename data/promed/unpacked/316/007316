Summary
-------
Since 2000, several incursions of bluetongue virus (BTV) occurred in the Mediterranean Basin involving European and surrounding countries. The Middle East represents one of the most important gateways for the access of BTV in Europe.

Limited data on the BTV situation in this area are available. In this perspective, an epidemiological survey on the presence of BTV in Lebanon was conducted.

Of the 181 serum samples tested, 97 (mean 53.6 per cent; 95 per cent confidence interval [CI]: 46.3-60.7) resulted positive when tested for the presence of BTV antibodies by c-ELISA; of these, 42 (mean 42 per cent; CI: 32.8-51.8) serum samples were from sheep and 55 (mean 67.9 per cent; CI: 57.1-77.1) serum samples were from goats.

14 blood samples (14/110; mean 12.7 per cent; CI: 7.8-20.3), 6 (6/66; mean 9.1 per cent; CI: 4.4-18.5) from sheep and 8 (8/44; mean 18.2 per cent; CI: 9.6-32.0) from goats, were positive by qRT-PCR. The results with serum-neutralization assay and typing performed by RT-PCR confirmed that 6 BTV serotypes are currently circulating in Lebanon: 1, 4, 6, 8, 16, and 24. This study is the 1st report that confirms the presence and circulation of BTV in Lebanon.

[Lebanon's annual OIE report for 2012 refers to bluetongue (BT) as a reportable disease not present during 2012, while its last occurrence termed as "unknown". The researchers-authors and their respective 3 institutes -- the Lebanese Agricultural Research Institute in Fanar; the Unit of Virology, OIE Reference Laboratory for Bluetongue, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del Molise "G Caporale", Teramo, Italy; and the Institut de la Recherche Veterinaire de Tunisie, Tunis, Tunisia -- which have performed the commendable surveillance, deserve to be praised and acknowledged for filling the epidemiological lacune on Lebanon's BT situation. Researchers and scientific institutions in other Middle-Eastern countries should be encouraged to follow suit.

Bluetongue has been subject to surveillance in Lebanon's southern neighbour, Israel, since 1950. Updated information can be found in the 2012 annual report of Israel's Veterinary Services (available at http://www.moag.gov.il/agri/files/doh_shnati_2012.pdf; in Hebrew). During 2012, 3 BTV serotypes were identified: 2, 4, and 16 (for a map showing locations and species, please go to page 35 of the report).

Between 1950 and 1974, 5 BTV serotypes were recorded in Israel, as follows (1st year of identification in parentheses): BTV-4 (1950), BTV-10 (1965), BTV-16 (1966), BTV-6 (1972), and BTV-2 (1973). As can be seen in the graph "Number of bluetongue diagnoses 1990-2012" (page 33 of the annual report), a significant increase of clinical cases has been observed since 2008, with, reportedly, 5 BTV serotypes added, namely 5, 8, 12, 15, and 24. The most prevalent serotype in Israel, throughout the years, has been BTV-4. During 2012, samples were obtained and tested from 102 farms, of which 7 were sheep farms, 94 cattle farms, and one goat farm. For the multi-annual number of outbreaks see the mentioned graph.

The disease is strictly seasonal, clinically expressed mainly in European sheep breeds and their crosses. Cases in goats are rare, with an exceptionally serious single outbreak attributed to BTV-24, in January 2009. BTV readily infects cattle which used to be seen as subclinical sentinels for virus circulation; however in recent years, probably due to the introduction of new serotypes, sporadic clinical cases do occur. Another orbivirus, epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV), has caused a serious outbreak in cattle throughout Israel in 2006. It may be assumed that this virus circulated throughout the entire region.

Interestingly, BTV-1, included among the published Lebanese list, has not been identified, so far, in Israel. - Mod.AS
