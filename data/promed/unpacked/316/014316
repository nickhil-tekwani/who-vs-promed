A new death [the 15th] was confirmed on Monday [8 Sep 2014], and the number of [_Listeria_] infections has now risen to 38.

The outbreak has been traced to the deli meat rullepoelse produced by the company Joern A. Rullepoelser, which has been shut down.

A total of 30 products -- including variations of rullepoelse, salami and hot dogs -- were recalled.

The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (Foedevarestrylsen) also warned on Monday [8 Sep 2014] of a listeriosis risk in halibut sold by the company Hjerting Laks that was sold in Netto, Irma and Foetex stores.

The food authorities advised that any consumers who might have halibut (hellefisk in Danish) purchased from Hjerting Laks before 1 Jun [2014] in their freezers to throw it out or return it to where it was purchased.

Foedevarestrylsen was criticised for not acting quickly enough in responding to the listeriosis outbreak, with the food and agriculture minister, Dan Joergensen, saying that "serious mistakes" took place.

Despite the continuing listeria problems, and recent _Salmonella_ and MRSA scares, the government has proposed cutting food safety funding.

[The total number of cases of listeriosis linked to Danish rullepoelse has risen from 24 to 38 and deaths from 13 to 15.

The implicated food source (rullepoelse) was only recalled on Mon 11 Aug 2014. Because some product may still be in consumers' refrigerators and because of the long incubation period of up to 2 months, additional cases can be expected. A warning about the Danish _Listeria_-contaminated rullepoelse has also appeared directed at Norwegian consumers since Danish rullepoelse is eaten in other Scandinavian countries.

Rullepoelse, meaning "rolled sausage" in Danish, is a piece of pork belly (also can be made with beef flank or lamb) that is flattened out and spread with herbs and seasoning (salt, pepper, allspice), chopped onions and in some variants also parsley, then rolled up, placed in a brine for a number of days and then placed in a special press, cooled and sliced thinly as a cold cut for the Danish open-faced sandwich, smoerrebroed; usually garnished with a thick slice of gelatinized bouillon and rings of raw onion (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiced_meat_roll). A similar "rolled sausage" is also eaten in Norway and Sweden.

The news report says that a meat product made by Joern A. Rullepoelser A/S has been proven to be the main source of infection but does not say how this was proven. Comparison of the molecular characteristics, such as PFGE, of _Listeria monocytogenes_ strains isolated from the Danish cases with each other and with isolates from suspected foods would help to establish whether a common source was involved and what would be the most likely source.

The news report above also mentions a listeriosis risk from halibut sold by the company Hjerting Laks that was sold in Netto, Irma and Foetex stores, but mentions no cases of listeriosis associated with this contaminated food.
