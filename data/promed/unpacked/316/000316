This summer, a working group involving Ducks Unlimited (DU) Canada (Chair),
Alberta Environment; Environment Canada's National Water Research Institute;
Manitoba Natural Resources; the Canadian Cooperative Wildlife Health Centre;
the California Waterfowl Association; the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service;
the U.S. National Wildlife Health Center; and Utah State University will
undertake a 3-year experiment to evaluate the best methods of managing avian
botulism outbreaks.
Botulism outbreaks kill millions of waterfowl and other water birds every
year. Nearly Can$1 million a year is spent by government agencies and
conservation groups on monitoring and carcass cleanup.
Birds acquire botulism from eating insects and maggots, infected with the
botulism toxin from feeding on decaying organic material where botulism
bacteria are present. For an outbreak to occur, botulism bacteria must be
found in large numbers, proper environmental conditions and a surface for
the bacteria to grow, such as the lake bed or carcasses of animals and
birds.
Research conducted by the botulism working group last year identified
cleanup efforts by DU and other groups were not very effective in collecting
the great number of bird carcasses in a wetland during a botulism breakout.
The experiment is designed to address the effectiveness of carcass cleanup
as a management strategy to minimize waterfowl losses during botulism
outbreaks in Prairie Canada.
Every year of the study, monitoring of Prairie wetlands will be used to
select 4 different lakes where botulism outbreaks have started. A number of
ducks from each of these lakes will be tagged with radio transmitters.
Different management efforts, ranging from no cleanup to intensive cleanup
efforts, will be applied at each lake. The fate of the radio-tagged ducks
will be recorded to determine their survival rates during the botulism
outbreak.
"This experiment will provide the guidance needed to best direct resources
in minimizing the impact of future avian botulism outbreaks. It may appear
to some people we are ignoring outbreaks in certain areas. The fact we have
designated areas as no cleanup will be contributing just as much information
to our overall experiment as the areas where we will be conducting massive
cleanups,'' said Henry Murkin, senior scientist with DU's Institute for
Wetland and Waterfowl Research.
People with information on botulism occurrence or who are interested in
volunteering for intensive carcass cleanup on Prairie wetlands this summer
should call 1 (800) 665-DUCK to be directed to a provincial botulism
coordinator.
