A white-tailed deer harvested by a hunter in the Ruby Valley in southwest Montana during the general hunting season tested positive for chronic wasting disease [CWD]. The buck is one of 24 samples coming back positive for CWD in the latest batch of test results.

The other new positive samples were from deer harvested within CWD Management Zones elsewhere in the state where the disease is known to exist.

The Ruby Valley deer was harvested on private land about a mile [1/6 km] west of Sheridan, within Hunting District 322. This case is the 1st detection of CWD in southwest Montana.

This year [2019] Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks (MFWP) conducted CWD surveillance in parts of northern, western, and southeastern Montana, primarily from hunter-harvested animals. In addition, hunters in all parts of the state were able to submit their own samples for testing. All samples are sent for testing to Colorado State University and those results were reported on a weekly basis to FWP. This is the last round of results from animals harvested during the general rifle season. Hunters who submitted animals for testing, can check online for their results at http://fwp.mt.gov/CWD.

This year [2019], more than 7000 animals have been sampled statewide, and 115 have tested positive for CWD. CWD has been detected across much of Montana, including the northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.

With the general hunting season now closed, FWP will review management strategies, testing results and other collected information to make plans for the next necessary steps in managing the disease. CWD cannot be eradicated once it infects a herd.

CWD is a fatal disease that can affect the nervous system of deer, elk, and moose. Transmission can most commonly occur through direct contact between animals, including urine, feces, saliva, blood, and antler velvet. Carcasses of infected animals may serve as a source of environmental contamination as well and can infect other animals that come into contact it.

The disease was first discovered in the wild in Montana south of Billings in 2017. There is no known transmission of CWD to humans. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that hunters harvesting an animal in an area where CWD is known to be present have their animal tested. If the animal tests positive, CDC advises against eating the meat.

[In the previous post Chronic wasting disease - USA (18): (TN) deer 20191123.6793739 I made a comment regarding states desiring to halt the apparently rapid spread of CWD in the cervid herds, yet still allowing for urine which can spread the prion agent, as bait for dear. - Mod.TG]

Dr Anne Justice-Allen of Arizona sent the following note:
Regarding the use of cervid urine for scent baiting/lures, Arizona and many other states prohibit the use of cervid urine-based baits. Please see the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies website regarding Best management practices for the prevention, surveillance, and management of CWD (https://www.fishwildlife.org/afwa-acts/afwa-committees/fish-wildlife-health-committee).

[Thank you, Dr Justice-Allen, for writing to update us regarding the use of urine for baits/lures in cervid hunting. I am glad to know more states are recognizing the dangers of urine baiting/luring. - Mod.TG

The Ruby Valley deer does represent a bit of a territory expansion of this disease in Montana. But clearly, even from this article, with 24 positives being found, it is not a new disease to Montana.
