More positive Hendra tests in virus outbreak
--------------------------------------------
Another 2 horses on a central Queensland property affected by the state's latest Hendra virus outbreaks have returned positive test results. Biosecurity Queensland is dealing with outbreaks on a property near Rockhampton and another at Ingham in the state's north. One horse died on each of the properties late last month [May 2012].

The state government today [5 Jun 2012] announced that 2 more horses have tested positive at Rockhampton. The government says a dog on the Ingham property returned a weak positive result, and the animal will be retested. Agriculture minister John McVeigh has told parliament there is only one other recorded case of a dog being infected with the virus. "While laboratory research has been conducted on dogs, there has only been one other recorded case of a dog being infected with Hendra virus," he said. Chief veterinary officer Dr Rick Symonds says the virus was detected in the dog's faeces, which means it may have passed through the animal with or without causing infection.

"If the dog has become infected we'd expect the antibodies would be built up to that virus and we'll be ale to detect that in blood samples," he said. Mr McVeigh said since the start of 2011 there have been 13 Hendra virus incidents in Queensland, resulting in the deaths or euthanasia of 16 horses and 1 dog.

"I cannot stress enough that horse owners need to remain vigilant," he said. The animals have been isolated and the properties remain quarantined.

Further positive Hendra virus results in Rockhampton and Ingham
---------------------------------------------------------------
Two horses on the Rockhampton property where a horse died of Hendra virus last week [week of 28 May 2012] have returned positive test results.

Biosecurity Queensland chief veterinary officer Rick Symons said the 2 horses would be re-tested to confirm the results before a decision was made about future action. There are 8 horses in total on the property.

"It is likely that the animals in Rockhampton contracted the disease from the originally infected horse which died last week," Dr Symons said.

In addition, Biosecurity Queensland officers will be re-testing a dog on the Ingham property after it returned a weak positive test result. "Further testing on the dog is needed as 3 out of the 4 samples taken from the animal were negative for Hendra virus," Dr Symons said. "This potential case would only be the 2nd natural infection in a dog to be recorded. Five horses and a number of other animals remain on the Ingham property -- all other animals have returned negative results in the 1st round of sampling. Follow up testing for all of these animals will be conducted at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory in Geelong."

Dr Symons said the animals were being isolated until the additional testing was finalised. "Biosecurity Queensland officers will continue to monitor the animals daily and work with the owners during this difficult time."

Queensland Health's senior director communicable diseases Dr Christine Selvey said that even if found to be infected, there is minimal risk of infection to humans from the dog. Queensland health has spoken to the dog's owners today [5 Jun 2012].

In addition, Queensland Health is investigating whether any more people had contact with these new cases of infected horses. "All identified contacts have been assessed as having low exposure. Queensland Health will continue to provide information and support to those contacts," she said.

[This disease does not seem to be letting up. Animal owners need to be especially vigilant of the fruit bats, where they roost, where fruit is that they like to eat, and keep their animals away from that area.

We are sorry for the loss of any animal life, but I know many people are keenly watching the re-testing of the dog.

The government has authorized additional dollars for more research into this disease. While it is appropriate and welcome news, it may not ease the pain of loss these people are feeling. I am sure this year will see another desire to have a vaccine sooner rather than later, and it is making progress.
