China's top legislature said it will immediately ban the trade and consumption of wild animals, in a fast-track decision it says will allow the country to win the battle against the coronavirus outbreak.

The announcement, made late on Monday [24 Feb 2020] according to the official Xinhua News Agency, comes after an initial suspension of the trade and consumption of wildlife in January [2020].

Scientists suspect, but have not proven, that the new coronavirus passed to humans from animals. The disease has now killed almost 2700 people in China and spread to countries around the globe.

Some of the earliest infections were found in people who had exposure to a wildlife market in Hubei's provincial capital Wuhan, where bats, snakes, civets, and other animals were sold.

"There has been a growing concern among people over the consumption of wild animals and the hidden dangers it brings to public health security since the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak," said Zhang Tiewei, a spokesman for the top legislature's Legislative Affairs Commission.

Zhang said it was both urgent and necessary for the decision to be made at the "critical moment for the epidemic prevention and control."

The decision, made by the National People's Congress, stipulates the illegal consumption and trade of wildlife will be "severely punished" as will be hunting, trading, or transporting wild animals for the purpose of consumption.

The use of wild animals for non-edible purposes, including scientific research, medical use, and display, will be subject to strict examination, approval, and quarantine inspection.

Prior to the announcement, traders legally selling donkey, dog, deer, crocodile, and other meat told Reuters they planned to get back to business as soon as the markets reopen.

Many academics, environmentalists, and residents in China have joined international conservation groups in calling for a permanent ban. Online debate within China has also heavily favored a permanent ban.

China's top legislative committee on Monday [24 Feb 2020] passed a proposal to ban all trade and consumption of wild animals, a practice believed responsible for the country's deadly coronavirus outbreak.

Beijing is yet to revise its wild animal protection law, but the passage of the proposal was 'essential' and 'urgent' in helping the country win its war against the epidemic, wrote state newspaper People's Daily.

People's Daily said the new policy 'comprehensively bans the consumption of wild animals' and 'will impose heavier punishment' against offenders.

The official Xinhua news agency said the proposal was submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC).

'It aims to completely ban the eating of wild animals and crack down on illegal wildlife trade,' it said.

The report added that the measure was aimed at 'safeguarding public health and ecological security.'

The Standing Committee is responsible for convening the 3000-member NPC, but it has decided to postpone the annual session due to the health crisis.

Late last month [January 2020] after the epidemic began exploding across the country, China ordered a temporary ban 'until the national epidemic situation is over.'

The deadly Chinese coronavirus outbreak began at the Huanan Seafood Wholesales Market in Wuhan. Scientists from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said tests proved humans caught it from animals at the market where customers choose from live animals that were slaughtered in front of them. [But see comment].

Conservationists accuse China of tolerating a shadowy trade in exotic animals for food or use in traditional medicines whose efficacy is not confirmed by science.

China instituted a similar temporary ban after the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus killed hundreds of people in China and Hong Kong in 2002-03 and was also traced to wild-animal consumption.

But the wildlife trade soon resumed.

Health experts say it poses a significant and growing public health risk by exposing humans to dangerous animal-borne pathogens.

The exact source of the coronavirus remains unconfirmed, with scientists variously speculating it originated in bats, pangolins, or some other mammal.

Scientists say SARS likely originated in bats, later reaching humans via civets.

The virus, known as SARS CoV, killed 775 people and infected more than 8000 globally during an epidemic between 2002 and 2003.

Civets, a cat-like creature, were among dozens of species listed as for sale by one of the merchants at the Wuhan market according to a price list that circulated on China's internet [https://tinyurl.com/vwt2ytz].

[China's decision to permanently ban the trade in wild animal species for human consumption, and to regulate the handling of wildlife for non-food purposes (such as scientific research, medical use, and display), has been advocated by scientists, including Chinese ones, in particular since the SARS epidemic.

While highly commending the long-awaited decision and wishing China's authorities success in the endeavors of its complex implementation, which will require overcoming deep-rooted old traditions, behavior, taste, as well as significant financial interests, we remind everyone that the exact identity of the animal source of the COVID-19 epidemic, and the genesis of its virus, SARS-CoV-2, are yet to be unraveled.

A team of Chinese scientists led by Dr Yu Wenbin, published on their Institute's website on Thu 20 Feb 2020, the results of a study based on the genomic data of 93 SARS-CoV-2 samples provided by 12 countries in a bid to track down the source of the infection and understand how it spread [ref. 1]. They found that while the virus had spread rapidly within the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, there had also been 2 major population expansions on 8 Dec 2019 and 6 Jan 2020. They also suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 was initially introduced from outside the market:

"1. Genomic evidence did not support the Hua Nan market as the birthplace of SARS-CoV-2. In the 1st 2 months, most infected people were linked to Wuhan, but some infected patients outside China may link to Guangdong or other places" [see also 20200210.6972104].

"2. Phyloepidemiologic analyses suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 source at the Hua Nan market was imported from elsewhere. The crowded market then boosted SARS CoV 2 circulation and spread it to the whole city in early December 2019."

"3. SARS-CoV-2 may have already circulated widely among humans in Wuhan before December 2019, probably beginning in mid to late November 2019. Some infected patients may have been overlooked because they had mild symptoms. We have demonstrated that a phylogenetic approach can be incorporated into epidemiological studies to search for the original source of SARS-CoV-2 and identify the direction of human-to-human transmissions."

While the paper is yet to be peer-reviewed prior to its publication in a scientific journal, its wide distribution in China's media (such as https://tinyurl.com/qq597pc, https://tinyurl.com/uo9qa29, https://tinyurl.com/vbutkba, etc.), may reflect the public's need for concrete, reliable data about the source of the epidemic, predominantly in China but also elsewhere.

Not a single demonstration of SARS-CoV-2 in a sample derived from any animal has become known so far. The virus has, unfortunately, already become internationally distributed, presenting high infectivity among humans. Information on its animal source, and on the index-case 1, remains of extreme importance, in particular for the prevention and control of future pestilences. Similarly, the ban upon trade/consumption of wildlife products will have its main impact in the future.
