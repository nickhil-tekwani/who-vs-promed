Ivory Coast's agricultural extension and research services launched a
2-year project to fight swollen shoot, a disease which destroyed 8600
hectares of cocoa trees in the past 5 years, the head of the National
Agricultural Research Center (CNRA) said. "Since 2003, our
researchers have found the presence of important centers of this
serious disease called swollen shoot," Tiemoko Yo told a news
conference in Abidjan.

Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa grower, has almost 2 million
hectares planted with cocoa trees, and the destruction of 8600
hectares has not significantly lowered annual output of around 1.3
million metric tons of cocoa beans. Swollen shoot is contagious, and
infected trees need to be cut down and burnt, but some cocoa analysts
play down the risks for Ivory Coast, notably for the main
southwestern and western growing areas, saying trees there are young
and resistant.

Partners in the Swollen Shoot Project are the CNRA, the Coffee and
Cocoa Farmers Development Fund, the Agricultural Research and
Investment Fund, the National School For Applied Statistics and the
National Bureau For Technical Development.

[Swollen shoot disease is caused by _Cacao swollen shoot virus_
(CSSV; genus _Badnavirus_). It was 1st recorded in Ghana in 1938 and
has since also been found in Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Cameroon, Sierra
Leone, Sri Lanka, Togo, and possibly Trinidad. Symptoms on cocoa vary
with different viral strains and may include interveinal chlorosis,
swollen stems and roots, root swelling only, or there may be no
symptoms at all. The virus can also infect some species in the
_Bombacaceae_, _Sterculiaceae_ (including cola nut), and _Tiliaceae_
(including jute). CSSV is spread by several species of mealybugs
(_Pseudococcidae_) in a semi-persistent manner (retained when the
vector moults, not replicating in the insect, not transmitted
congenitally). It can also be transmitted by grafting and mechanical
means but not by contact between host plants, seed, or pollen.

CSSV is indigenous to West African forest trees and appears to have
transferred to cocoa following the introduction of the crop. The
virus causes crop losses of an estimated total of 50 000 tons
annually in Africa, affecting the economies of the respective
countries. It has forced migration of farmers resulting in
environmental damage due to increased clearing of forests. A "zero
tolerance" philosophy has been adopted by most affected countries,
which requires the removal of all infected trees and neighbouring
plants. In Ghana, for example, this policy has resulted in the
destruction of millions of cocoa trees during the last 50 years, and
many millions more are awaiting removal. It is estimated that over
160 million trees have either died from CSSV or have been eradicated
in the whole of West Africa, and new farms are getting rapidly
infected. The mealybug vectors are very difficult to control, and
native forests serve as pathogen reservoirs. Thus, disease management
must rely on phytosanitary techniques, clean planting and grafting
material, and use of resistant crop varieties. Breeding programmes
for virus or vector resistance have been initiated.
