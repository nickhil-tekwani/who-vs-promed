A local health department has confirmed 2 cases of Lacrosse
encephalitis. The patients are 2 adults from Polk County. Public
Health Supervisor Bonnie Leonard hasn't released the identities,
ages, or the gender of either patient. She also won't say which
communities they're from. Both cases were confirmed in July [2008] in
separate areas of the county.

Leonard says one of the patients will make a full recovery, the
other; she hasn't gotten a hold of.

Lacrosse encephalitis is a mosquito-borne disease. Leonard says it
cannot be transmitted from person-to-person.

To protect yourself from the disease, health workers suggest using
mosquito repellent and wearing long sleeves.

You should also avoid having containers in your yard that hold water.

[This report is unusual because the 2 cases were in adults. Almost
all cases of La Crosse virus encephalitis occur in children. The
following comment was given in ProMED-mail archive no. 20080717.2164:

La Crosse virus (LACV) is in the California serogroup of viruses in
the _Bunyaviridae_ family. Although most LACV infections [result in]
subclinical or mild febrile illnesses, frank encephalitis progressing
to seizures and coma can occur, [but] the case fatality rate is less
than one per cent. In the USA, particularly in the upper midwestern
states, an average of 70 clinical cases are reported annually, the
vast majority in pre-adolescent children. Hospitalizations and
subsequent care can be lengthy with costs approaching USD 450 000.

The virus is transmitted by _Aedes triseriatus_ mosquitoes and
maintained by transovarial transmission with amplification in forest
rodents (chipmunks _Tamias striatus_ and squirrels _Sciurus
carolinensis_). More recently, the virus has been isolated from the
Asian tiger mosquito, _Aedes albopictus_, which has become
established in the Western Hemisphere. No vaccine against LACV is
available. A brief fact sheet for LACV and its pathogenesis and
epidemiology provided by the US CDC can be accessed at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/arbor/lacfact.htm>.
