Abstract
--------
Wheat blue dwarf disease (WBD) was first reported in China in the
1960s. It has caused severe losses on several occasions in winter
wheat (_Triticum aestivum_) in northwestern China, and the nature of
the pathogenic agent has been unknown. Here we have shown that WBD
was caused by a 16SrI-C phytoplasma transmitted by _Psammotettix
striatus_. This finding was based on molecular diagnostics, insect
transmission trials, and host-range determination.

Portions of the 16S rRNA and ribosomal protein (rp) genes were
amplified from WBD-infected wheat seedlings by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR). The nucleotide sequences of these amplicons showed
high identity to these genes from phytoplasma strains in the aster
yellows group (16SrI). Phylogenetic analyses were carried out on
sequences from 16S rRNA and ribosomal protein genes, respectively,
and both results indicated that WBD phytoplasma was a member of the
16SrI group and most closely related to subgroup 16SrI-C.

WBD-infected _P. striatus_ were present in wheat fields with WBD, and
phytoplasma infection was verified by PCR detection followed by DNA
sequencing. Insect transmission trials confirmed that _P. striatus_
transmitted the WBD phytoplasmal agent from infected wheat to healthy
wheat seedlings and seven other different plant species in the
greenhouse. A survey of various weed species near WBD-infected wheat
fields found 10 plant species in seven families to be positive for
the presence of WBD phytoplasma.

[Blue dwarf disease (WBD) is considered to be one of the most
important diseases of winter wheat in arid and semiarid areas of
northwestern China. More than 10 outbreaks resulting in severe crop
losses have been reported since the 1960's. It was first thought to
be caused by a virus. The leafhopper _Psammotettix striatus_ was
found to be the vector of WBD. _P. striatus_ is a significant
economic pest and also thought to be the vector of _Winter wheat
mosaic virus_ (genus _Tenuivirus_) which is present in much of the
same area as WBD.

Symptoms of WBD include severe chlorosis, mottling, and distortion of
new leaves; abnormal dark blue-green colour and stiffening of old
leaves; deformed spikes; abnormal excessive tillering; and severe
stunting and distortion of plants.

Other phytoplasmas of the 16SrI (aster yellows) group were previously
found in pasture grasses and as causal organisms of oat proliferation
(16SrI-A), barley deformation (16SrI-B) and maize bushy stunt
(16SrI-B) diseases. However, not much is known about phytoplasmas
affecting graminaceous hosts compared to those affecting dicot
species, and therefore the work reported above is an important
contribution to understanding these important pathogens.
