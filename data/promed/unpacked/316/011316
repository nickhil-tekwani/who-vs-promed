Eggs used in deep-fried ice cream batter have been blamed for a Queensland food poisoning outbreak that left 110 people ill.

Metro South Health officials confirmed last night [8 Jan 2015] that tests conducted at Chin Chin Chinese Restaurant [in Logan City] returned positive for salmonellae, and they believed the raw eggs were to blame, the Courier Mail reports.

Eight of the 15 people at a birthday dinner on Sunday [4 Jan 2015] night fell violently ill, with 6 hospitalized, 2 overnight, and 4 put on intravenous fluids. "I haven't eaten for 3 days," one attendee said. "It's just dreadful, the worst thing I've ever been through." Another attendee said her family was still feeling the effects of the poisoning almost one week later.

The popular family restaurant located in Springwood was slapped with a temporary closure by Logan City Council as victims continue to come forward, with cases almost doubling overnight. So far, 110 people who dined at Chin Chin on Saturday and Sunday nights (3-4 Jan 2015) have reported falling ill. Health inspectors expect that number to rise over the next 2 days and have called for guests of the restaurant to avoid public areas until free of food poisoning symptoms for 24 hours.

A sign on the restaurant's door yesterday [8 Jan 2015] read: "Closed for maintenance until further notice."

[A variety of serotypes of _Salmonella enterica_ can be associated with fowl meat and eggs. The serotype here has not been reported. Of note, in chickens, _S._ Enteritidis colonizes internal organs as well as the tissues of the reproductive tract, including the ovaries, oviduct, cloacal and vaginal tissues. From the ovaries, the organism can contaminate the yolk in some eggs, but the majority of salmonellae are deposited from the reproductive tract to the albumen (egg white) close to the yolk membrane or on the viteline membrane. The contaminating bacteria survive in the albumen as the eggshell forms and persists after eggs are laid.

Eggs are a standard ingredient in most homemade ice cream recipes (http://www.foodsafety.gov/blog/homemadeicecream.html). They add flavor and color, prevent ice crystallization, and make for that smooth and creamy texture. To prevent this ingredient from causing harmful infections, just follow these guidelines for safe cooking and handling. At the FDA, we advise consumers to start with a cooked egg base for ice cream. This is especially important if you're serving people at high risk for foodborne infections: infants, older adults, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems.

To make a cooked egg base (also known as a custard base):
1. Combine eggs and milk as indicated in the recipe. (Other ingredients, such as sugar, may be added at this step.)
2. Cook the mixture gently to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F, stirring constantly. The cooking will destroy Salmonella, if present. Use a food thermometer to check the temperature of the mixture. At this temperature, the mixture will firmly coat a metal spoon (but please don't lick the spoon if the custard is not fully cooked!).
3. After cooking, chill the mixture before adding other ingredients and freezing.

Other options include using egg substitute products or pasteurized eggs in your ice cream, or find a recipe without eggs.

Fried ice cream (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fried_ice_cream) is a dessert made from a breaded scoop of ice cream that is quickly deep-fried creating a warm, crispy shell around the still-cold ice cream.

There are conflicting stories about the dessert's origin. Some claim that it was 1st served during the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, where the ice cream sundae was also invented, though in 1894, a Philadelphia company was given credit for its invention, saying: "A small, solid cake of the [ice] cream is enveloped in a thin sheet of pie crust and then dipped into boiling lard or butter to cook the outside to a crisp. Served immediately, the ice cream is found to be as solidly frozen as it was 1st prepared." A 3rd claim, beginning in the 1960s, asserts that fried ice cream was invented by Japanese tempura restaurants.

In the USA, fried ice cream has been associated with Asian cuisine, appearing in reviews of Chinese, Japanese, and Polynesian restaurants in the "Dining Out" section of the New York Times in the 1970s. It also came to be associated with Mexican cuisine, in large part due to national chain Chi-Chi's adopting a fried ice cream made with tortillas and cinnamon as its "signature dessert" when it opened in the early 1980s.

The dessert is commonly made by taking a scoop of ice cream frozen well below the temperature at which ice cream is generally kept, possibly coating it in raw egg, rolling it in cornflakes or cookie crumbs, and briefly deep frying it. The extremely low temperature of the ice cream prevents it from melting while being fried. It may be sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar and a touch of peppermint, though whipped cream or honey may be used as well. The Asian recipe usually uses tempura batter. Mexican versions use corn flakes, nuts, cookie crumbs, or tortillas for coating. Common flavors in Asian restaurants are green tea, vanilla, taro and red bean. - Mod.LL
