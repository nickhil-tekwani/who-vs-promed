MERS tests for camels and livestock
-----------------------------------
The Kingdom has started testing camels in the country for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), according to Minister of Agriculture Fahd Balghuneim.

Speaking at a workshop in Riyadh recently on registering and numbering livestock in the country, Balghuneim said the ministry would start testing all livestock in the Kingdom starting next week [week of 9 Jun 2014] to make sure they do not have [MERS-CoV].

He said there would be coordination with the Saudi Wildlife Authority to take samples from wild animals kept in nature reserves to determine the level of coronavirus infection in the Kingdom. He said there is no suitable equipment to conduct speedy tests for coronavirus. Officials have to take blood or mucus samples, which takes a long time.

Balghuneim confirmed that there are no tests for the coronavirus at quarantine sites in countries exporting animals to Saudi Arabia. He said the measure is part of the ministry's program to control the spread of infectious diseases. Livestock entering the Kingdom just before Ramadan [Sun 29 Jun-Mon 28 Jul 2014] July] would be quarantined and vaccinated in exporting countries.

"We started registering and numbering livestock last year [2013] in Um Raqaiba. We started with camels belonging to Prince Mishal bin Abdulaziz to encourage other camel owners to do the same. Next week we will speed up the operation. The numbering of livestock will include sheep and camels in Badia through contractors working for the Ministry of Agriculture," he said.

Balghuneim said centers in exporting countries quarantine their livestock for a few days, vaccinate and then send them to the Kingdom, as required by the Saudi government. When the livestock reaches the Kingdom, samples are taken. If the animals are disease-free, they are allowed entry into the Kingdom. If they have diseases, they are quarantined. Those animals that cannot be treated are put down.

He said the ministry is investigating other ways to test camels and livestock bound for the Kingdom. The minister said the Kingdom does not import live cows from countries identified by the World Health Organization to have mad cow disease [BSE].

"We are responsible for managing livestock, and to get accurate information we need to have an inventory of livestock in the Kingdom." He said numbering methods for inventories are used in many countries.

[The media report above requires an explanatory note to avoid confusion:
The Saudi Minister addressed, in fact, 3 distinct issues:

1. MERS in livestock and wildlife: mass testing and control.
2. Safeguarding the health of imported animals for the Ramadan.
3. Registering and numbering livestock in the country.

Combining MERS-CoV mass testing with the other issues (--- "said the measure is part of the ministry's program to control the spread of infectious diseases. Livestock entering the Kingdom just before Ramadan would be quarantined and vaccinated in exporting countries") may confuse. The tests and vaccinations of internationally traded animals are applied while the animals are in the exporting countries, according to the veterinary import requirements of Saud Arabia, to prevent the introduction of infectious diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease and Rift Valley fever. There is no vaccine against MERS-CoV. Re MERS-CoV, Saudi Arabia may be regarded rather a potential disease exporter.

[2] Qatar: camel milk, suspected human exposure in slaughterhouse

MERS virus found in camel milk
------------------------------
The virus that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS coronavirus, MERS-CoV] has been found in camel milk. Scientists don't know whether infected milk can sicken people, but experts say the results are reason enough to warn against drinking raw camel milk, a widespread tradition in the Middle East. The Qatari government has already issued new guidelines recommending that milk be boiled before consumption.

The new findings come from a group of researchers at Qatar's Supreme Council of Health; the country's Ministry of Environment; Erasmus MC in Rotterdam, the Netherlands; and the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. They were announced at a press conference in Doha on Wed [4 Jun 2014; see at http://tinyurl.com/nt37zv3], and a paper about them was submitted to the journal Eurosurveillance today [6 Jun 2014], says Erasmus MC virologist Chantal Reusken, the 1st author.

The researchers also discovered that almost one in 10 people who come in contact with camels on the job have antibodies against [MERS-CoV], a sign that they were infected with the virus at some point -­ although none of them got very sick from it.

Almost 2 years after MERS emerged, it's still unclear how many of the patients become infected. Direct transmission between people occurs, and many of the more than 500 new MERS cases that Saudi Arabia has reported in the past 3 months appear to have occurred in hospitals as a result of inadequate infection control measures. But there isn't evidence yet of widespread human-to-human transmission outside hospitals. And researchers have uncovered more and more evidence that contact with dromedary camels may be a risk factor for getting [MERS-CoV]. Camels in 9 countries in the Middle East and Africa have been shown to be infected with [MERS-CoV], and the virus appears to jump from camels to people, researchers have reported. But where and how it crosses the species barrier is still very unclear.

The international team working in Qatar has collected thousands of samples from animals, people, and the environment and tested them for evidence of the virus or antibodies against it; their samples included milking camels at 2 locations in Qatar. Among the animals that were shedding the virus from their nose or in their feces -­ signaling an active infection -­ more than half also had virus RNA in their milk.

The milk was obtained using traditional methods, in which udders aren't routinely cleaned before milking, and a calf is allowed to suckle to get the milk flow started. As a result, the researchers can't tell whether the infected camels secrete the virus directly into the milk; it's possible that the milk becomes contaminated through the calves' saliva, traces of feces, or the milkers' hands. It's also not clear whether humans can get sick from drinking unpasteurized milk, says Marion Koopmans, who heads the Dutch group.

In another recent study, researchers at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases showed that live MERS virus added to unpasteurized camel milk could survive for 3 days.

The World Health Organization (WHO) will soon issue revised guidelines that, like the Qatari government, recommend against drinking raw milk, says Peter Ben Embarek, a specialist in foodborne diseases at WHO's headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland; he says that's never a good idea.

Camel meat might be another transmission route; the scientists found that 13 percent of lymph node samples taken at a slaughterhouse contained the virus. But they can't say whether this means that meat is actually contaminated, or how much risk that would pose to consumers.

The team also discovered that 8.7 percent of workers at camel farms and a camel slaughterhouse had antibodies to the virus. The fact that none of them reported a serious illness suggests that MERS may be more common than scientists knew so far and cause mild disease or even none at all in more people. "We always suspected that the cases we knew about were the tip of the iceberg," Ben Embarek says. The study gives scientists a better understanding of how widespread the virus really is, he says.

In the guidelines issued this week [week of 2 Jun 2014], the Qatari government also indicated how to protect camel workers. Among other things, they should wash their hands frequently, wear protective face masks (although temperatures of up to 50 deg C [122 deg F] make this almost impossible in Qatar) and wear protective clothing and gloves that should be washed daily. [See "Supreme Health Council issues new MERS guidelines in Qatar", dated 5 Jun 2014, at http://dohanews.co/sch-gives-new-guidelines-pilgrims-mers-study-results-revealed/].

Given the paucity of data so far on [MERS-CoV] transmission, scientists have praised the Dutch-Qatari team for their work. The collaboration is a "showcase of what should happen in the region," Ben Embarek says. Ian Mackay, a virologist at the University of Queensland, St Lucia, in Australia who follows MERS closely on his blog, called the study "great stuff" in a tweet today [6 Jun 2014] and said Qatar was "really to be congratulated" for embarking on it.

[Saudi Arabia's enhanced efforts to address the objective of MERS-CoV's animal reservoir, as apparent from item [1] above, is in tandem with a recent revision and boosting of the Kingdom's policy on the epidemic in the human population. According to reviewed statistics of the Ministry of Health's Command & Control Center, the total number of confirmed MERS-CoV cases recorded in the Kingdom in humans since 12 Jun 2012 has risen, as of 7 Jun 2014, to 698 confirmed cases (about 18 percent higher than earlier data), of which 285 fatalities, 359 recoveries, 54 still under treatment (see, with map and additional data, at http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/mediastatement-2014-06-07-001.aspx).

Detailed epidemiological information addressing the suspected source(s) of infection and contact history of the patients, is still rather partial. According to ECDC recent update of MERS-CoV risk assessment (see ProMED-mail post 20140604.2518134, issued prior to the publication of the revised Saudi statistics), globally 665 cases have been confirmed since the start of the epidemic, 354 (53 percent) of them identified as "primary cases", meaning that these cases had no link to previously confirmed cases based on the publicly available information. The remaining 311 cases (47 percent) have been identified as "secondary cases", meaning contact with a confirmed case prior the onset of the illness. The secondary cases included several (in Saudi Arabia, 7 percent) healthcare workers. Only a minority have documented camel contacts. Since more than 50 percent of the cases, contacts are unknown or could be definitely excluded, the epidemiology of MERS-CoV remains rather obscure.

The information on a plan to test "all livestock in the Kingdom" (according to 2012 OIE rounded figures: about 400 000 cattle, 7 million sheep and goats, 213 000 camels) "to make sure they do not have [MERS-CoV]" is in need of verification. The endemicity of the virus in the Arabian peninsula seems to have already been sufficiently demonstrated but the agent's dynamics and clinical impact (or its absence) in animals (such as camels and bats) are in urgent need for elucidation to enable rational, scientifically based measures to be
applied in animals.

Is the information on a planned mass testing indeed correct? In case affirmative, which species are to be tested, with which tests? And what would be the fate of "positives"?!

On the other hand, speeding up "the registering and numbering of livestock" which started last year (2013) in a limited geographical region, will indeed be an important step forward. Animal identification is essential for the upgrading of Saudi Arabia's veterinary disease control system, in relation to MERS and beyond.

MERS-CoV infection has been confirmed in several dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia by RT-PCR and virus isolations. The findings have been published in scientific journals. The clinical signs (predominantly short-lived rhinitis) were slight or absent; in need of further observations and documentation.

MERS-CoV has been reported to the OIE as an emerging zoonotic disease in dromedary camels by 2 countries, Qatar (PCR, virus isolation) and Oman (RT-PCR).

Qatar's transparency and its efforts to unravel the enigma, benefitting from close cooperation with international experts, as apparent in item [2], are highly commendable.

The new MERS guidelines issued by Qatar's Supreme Health Council, advise residents who wish to perform Hajj and Umrah in the coming months, to postpone their trips if they are pregnant, elderly, or infirm.
