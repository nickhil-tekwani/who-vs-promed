[In portions of the 5 Mar 2011 post, Avian influenza, human (19):
Indonesia (NS), susp. 20110305.0718, the location of Padang was
incorrectly given as North Sumatera, in place of the correct location
West Sumatera. ProMED-mail thanks Ronen Skaletzky for drawing
attention to this error. - Mod.CP]

The M Djamil hospital has treated 8 bird flu suspected patients
during the period January to March 2011. Of these, 3 have been
released from the hospital, and 5 are still under intensive treatment.
The patients reside around Padang city, with one from Dharmasraya.

A total of 5 patients were tested negative for bird flu by a rapid
test, while one patient has tested positive. The hospital has
collected blood samples from the patients for laboratory
confirmation.

[One of the 8 patients suspected to have contracted avian A/(H5N1)
virus infection in the vicinity of Padang, West Sumatera has tested
positive by a rapid test, and 5 have tested negative by the same test.
Results for the other 2 patients are presumably pending.

The nature of the rapid test is not explained, and the outcome of the
laboratory analysis of the patients' blood samples is awaited.

A bird flu alert concerning an outbreak of avian influenza A/(H5N1)
in poultry in North Sumatera was posted on ProMED-mail yesterday, 4
Mar 2011 (see below).
