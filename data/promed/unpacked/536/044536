The city has witnessed 200 cases of swine flu (H1N1) in the 1st 5 months of the year [2019], the highest since 2016. There have been 2 deaths owing to the virus in March 2019.

While there were no cases reported between January and May in 2018, 70 cases (3 deaths) were reported in 2017, and 2 cases in 2016. Doctors, however, claimed the outbreak is "under control."

The number of cases has dropped from 85 in March to 47 in April and 29 in May [2019], according to the epidemiology cell of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). There were 39 swine flu cases reported in February [2019].

Doctors said fluctuations in weather conditions or changes in virus strains may be the causes behind the large number of H1N1 cases reported this year [2019]. "The drop in cases is a positive sign. The spread of the infection is in control, and there is no cause to worry. We suspect that the high numbers could be owing to climatic change, but further studies need to be done to confirm it," said Dr Padmaja Keskar, executive health officer, BMC. In Mumbai, the virus is known to be prevalent during the post-monsoon and winter seasons, when cooler conditions are conducive to the spread of the virus.

After the widespread swine flu outbreak in 2015 across the country -- during which Mumbai reported 1815 cases and 19 deaths in the period between January and May [2015] -- fewer cases have been reported. Effective vaccination programmes are said to be a major reason behind the control of the infection. Dr P Awte, state surveillance officer, Directorate of Health Services, who heads the vaccination program in the state, said that the focus would be on vulnerable population groups during vaccination. "Patients with immunodeficiency disorders or lifestyle diseases, children, pregnant women and senior citizens are the worst hit, so our surveillance is focused around them," said Dr Awte.

"We have also procured more than [125 000] swine flu vaccines, which we started dispensing from April 2019," he said. Last year [2018], more than [155 000] people were vaccinated against the flu in the state.

The primary symptoms of swine flu include fever, lethargy, headache, cough, sore throat, and nausea. While most people recover within a week, it can get complicated for people with low immunity and chronic diseases.

The number of influenza deaths in Australia since the beginning of the year [2019] has tripled from the same period in 2018, the government said on Wednesday [22 May 2019].

Data released by the Department of Health on Wednesday [22 May 2019] revealed that 99 people died from the flu in Australia between 1 Jan and 20 May [2019]. It is a near 200 percent increase from the 34 deaths in the same period in 2018 and from the 5-year national average, which is also 34.

The number of cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza was 54 432, a 450 percent from the 5-year average of 9855 and a 304 percent increase from 13 444 in the same period in 2018.

In Victoria, Australia's 2nd largest state by population, influenza has killed 26 people -- 3 children and 23 aged-care residents -- compared to zero deaths at the same time in 2018.

Jenny Mikakos, the state's Health Minister, told News Corp Australia that the high toll was a result of flu season starting earlier than usual. "We are seeing a lot of communicable diseases spread through overseas travel; that's certainly been the case in terms of measles cases and flu cases," she said. "We have seen a very significant summer flu season this year [2019] as a result of people coming back from the northern hemisphere with the flu and that spreading in the community. Juvenile flu deaths tend to be associated with situations where there might be other illnesses and vulnerabilities involved with those children."

More than 11.4 million doses of the influenza vaccine have been administered nationwide.

[Undoubtedly, influenza case numbers have been quite high in Australia this season, and efforts to provide adequate precautionary advice and vaccine coverage, particularly to the high-risk groups, should continue to reduce the associated morbidity and mortality. - Mod.UBA
