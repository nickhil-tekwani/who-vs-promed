Schmallenberg virus more difficult to discover in cattle
--------------------------------------------------------
It is more difficult to prove the presence of the Schmallenberg virus [SBV] in calves than it is in lambs; on the other hand, the number of reports on congenitally malformed calves is on the increase.

That the virus is difficult to prove in calves is due to the longer gestation period of cattle compared with sheep. "In cattle, the time gap between SBV infection and parturition is significantly longer than in sheep. This decreases the chance of the virus remaining in the (malformed) foetus until parturition," said Wim van der Poel of the Central Veterinary Institute (CVI). The same is seen in the related Akabane virus in Asia and Australia. This virus is also more difficult to prove in calves than in lambs.

The calves are born infected or with antibodies. Once a test for antibody is available, it will become possible to say with certainty whether they have had been infected by SBV. Until then, the calves are examined for SBV in the same manner as lambs.

The Dutch Food and Wares Authority (nVWA) gets more and more reports of deformed calves. During the last 10 days, 22 cattle farms with deformed calves have been added to the list. Currently, 86 cattle farms have sent deformed calves to the Animal Health Service (GD). The SBV has not yet been demonstrated in even one of the calves examined in the Netherlands. [According to the data as of noon, 18 Jan 2012, the number of holdings reporting the occurrence of congenital malformations is: cattle 101, sheep 129, goats 11. See http://www.vwa.nl/txmpub/files/?p_file_id=2201855. - Mod.AS]

The German Veterinary Institute (Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute/FLI), has detected, at the beginning of January 2012, SBV in a stillborn calf. This remains the 1st and only case of the virus shown in calves.

The health service in the German state North Rhine-Westphalia expected in the coming months 15 to 20 per cent of the calves to be born as SBV infected. No forecasts for Dutch calves are yet available. "Assuming that most cattle have been infected during the autumn, I expect a peak of deformed calves in February 2012," said van der Poel.

New herd virus haunts Europe
----------------------------
In November 2011, farmers from Schmallenberg, Germany, noticed that some of their dairy cows were feverish and not producing much milk. Not 2 months later, the virus -- named the Schmallenberg virus, after the 25 000-person town -- has been observed on around 90 farms [the number has increased significantly. - Mod.AS] in Germany and the neighboring countries of Belgium and the Netherlands, affecting adult cows, and also causing stillbirths and birth defects in calves, lambs, and newborn goats.

"We are taking this very, very seriously," Thomas Mettenleiter, head of the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute, a German animal health research center, told ScienceNOW. "Now, in some herds, 20 per cent to 50 per cent of lambs show such malformations," including fluid sacs in the brain and scoliosis, Mettenleiter added. "And most of these animals are born dead."

New animal virus takes Northern Europe by surprise
--------------------------------------------------
The virus appears to be transmitted by midges (_Culicoides_ spp.), and infections likely occurred in summer and autumn of last year [2011], but fetuses that were exposed to the virus in the womb are only now being born. The 1st cases of lambs with congenital malformations such as hydranencephaly -- where parts of the brain are replaced by sacs filled with fluid -- and scoliosis (a curved spine) appeared before Christmas. "Now, in some herds 20 per cent to 50 per cent of lambs show such malformations," Mettenleiter [FLI, Riems, Germany] says. "And most of these animals are born dead."

Scientists are bracing for many more cases to appear, especially in cattle, because bovine fetuses infected in summer 2011 would be expected to be born in February and March 2012.

Virologists have made some headway since they first announced the detection of the SBV in November 2011. They have been able to isolate the virus and to culture it in insect and hamster cells. Evidence that it's responsible for the observed symptoms has become stronger with its [demonstration in] brain tissue of affected lambs. "The characteristic malformations, together with the frequent virus detection in brains of malformed animals, clearly support a causal link," FLI's Martin Beer says. In a 1st animal experiment, scientists at FLI also infected 3 cows with the virus and showed that the virus replicated in them; one developed fever and diarrhea.

FLI researchers have already sequenced the genome of the new pathogen. Comparisons indicate it is a member of a group called the orthobunyaviruses. These viruses consist of 3 segments called S (short), M (middle), and L (long) and are mainly transmitted by mosquitoes and midges. Although the viruses are best known from Asia, some have been circulating in Europe for decades. Initially, scientists said the virus most closely resembled the Akabane virus, a pathogen that has been found in cattle, buffalo, sheep, camels, dogs, and other species, leading them to call it an "Akabane-like virus."

Now they say that at least the S segment of Schmallenberg's genome is most closely related to sequences of a different orthobunyavirus called Shamonda virus. Both Akabane and Shamonda virus belong to the so-called Simbu serogroup and are known to infect ruminants and to be transmitted by midges. But there are few orthobunyavirus sequences available with which to compare the new virus, so scientists are starting to sequence more members of the family. "Orthobunyaviruses have been neglected for a long time, and we just don't know a lot about them," says Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit of the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, Germany.

A host of questions remains unanswered. Which vector species is transmitting the disease? Can animals infect each other directly? And of course, where did the virus come from? "The problem with orthobunyaviruses is that their segmented genome makes the emergence of new combinations very easy, just like with influenza viruses," Schmidt-Chanasit says. He points to a recent outbreak of a new orthobunyavirus in Peru. The pathogen, named Iquitos virus, turned out to have combined S and L segments of a known virus called Oropouche and the M segment of a new virus.

Whether the SBV could sicken humans is unknown. At least 30 orthobunyaviruses have been associated with human disease; the Oropouche virus, also a member of the Simbu serogroup, causes a febrile disease often associated with headaches, dizziness, skin rash, and malaise, whereas the Iquitos virus can cause diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea. But these viruses seem to be dependent on midges to infect humans and are not known to be directly transmitted from infected farm animals. Midges are less likely to bite humans than mosquitoes, and there have been no reports of unusual human illnesses from farmers whose livestock is infected.

A risk assessment by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in Stockholm, issued just before Christmas 2011, concluded that "it is unlikely that this new orthobunyavirus can cause disease in humans, but it cannot be excluded at this stage." But the experts recommended closely monitoring the health of farmers and vets.

In order not to lose time and to answer the most pressing questions fast, FLI has decided not to file for any patents on Schmallenberg-related discoveries. "Our resources are limited," Mettenleiter says, "and we are happy to share our knowledge and materials with anyone interested in it for noncommercial or commercial reasons." The German and Dutch institutes have divided up the work: the Dutch researchers will concentrate on sheep, Van der Poel says, while their German colleagues focus on cattle.

[According to German press (Westfalen Blat, 17 Jan 2012), the FLI has already collected blood samples from cattle and sheep, which will be serologically tested as soon as the test becomes available. This will allow a better evaluation of SBV incidence and of the expected losses due to the possible occurrence of malformed calves.

On Wed 18 Jan 2012, the German CVO submitted an official notification to the OIE on the 'Emerging disease' Schmallenberg virus. Doing so, Germany joined the earlier similar notifications from the Netherlands and Belgium.

According to the notification, the event started on 27 Dec 2011, the morbidity is 2.88 per cent and the mortality 2.52 per cent; there is "no zoonotic impact". The causal agent is 'Schmallenberg virus'. The total number of outbreaks is 13, all in sheep, located in the German states (Landern) Lower Saxony, North Rhine Westphalia, and Hessen. The reported "susceptible population" counts 2460, number of "cases" 71, "deaths" 62 ,"destroyed" 6. The notification, including a map, is available at http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=11514.

The size of the susceptible population with respect to a teratogenic virus is a complex issue. In fact, the actual susceptible population is composed of pregnant ewes during the 1st semester of their pregnancy. If this segment of the population had been considered for the calculation, the morbidity/mortality rates would have become significantly higher than the given 2.88 and 2.52 per cent.

Following the notifications from 3 members on SBV, the OIE may consider adding this disease to its list. - Mod.AS
