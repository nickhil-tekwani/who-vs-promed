[There are a couple of interesting points in this posting. 1st, the
report indicates that the outbreak is quite close to China. 2nd, it
is unclear why the Russian animal health authorities refer to
modified stamping out -- because the carcasses were buried -- when
all of the animals, and, in-contact animals, were destroyed. - Mod.PC]
