Measles broke out last week in Eivissa Island (Balearic Islands),
Spain, affecting 5 children between 8 and 14 months who were positive
for measles infection (IgM and PCR); none of the children were
vaccinated against the virus and the outbreak was initiated in a
kindergarten. One of the children was hospitalized with possible
measles pneumonia. To date the virus has not been isolated, though the
samples were sent to the reference laboratory at the Centro Nacional
de Microbiologia [National Microbiology Center (Madrid). No more
cases have appeared recently and all the children in contact with the
measles patients have been vaccinated.
In 1999, Spain officially declared 285 cases of measles (0.7 cases/100
000), but in the Balearic Islands only 4 cases (0.5/100 000) were
reported. The beginning of the eradication program of measles in our c
ountry (Spain) since January 2001 is the best opportunity to learn the
real situation of the measles in developed countries in Europe.

[Thank you very much, Dr. Reina, for sharing this information on the
measles outbreak in the Balearic Islands of Spain. According to the
Ministry of Health website, the recommended age for vaccination with
MMR (measles, mumps & rubella vaccine) is 12-15 months for the first
dose and 3-5 years for the second dose (for those who missed the
second dose before 6 years of age, a second dose is recommended
between 11-13 years). In circumstances of high risk, a dose at 9
months of age or earlier is recommended:

It would be interesting to know if the index case had been preventable
(older than 12 months of age).
With the increasing number of countries adopting the goal of measles
eradication, measles outbreaks are becoming of interest in the field
of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in these countries.
Many of the countries in the Americas Region have interrupted
indigenous transmission of measles virus. For additional information
