Trichinellosis imported to Germany from Poland
----------------------------------------------
We report on 4 cases of imported Trichinellosis to Germany (Hamburg)
from a current outbreak in Poland (West Pomerania). All patients had
a travel history to Poland during the last 3 months, where they
bought and consumed pork meat and sausage in a local butchery.
Trichinellosis was suspected on clinical grounds and history. Of the
4 cases, 3 had an uncomplicated course of disease and treatment and
one patient was admitted to our hospital with marked eosinophilia
(eosinophils 51 percent, 6300/ul), elevated liver enzymes, and
elevated muscle enzymes. Her ECG on the day of admission was normal,
but the next day, when albendazol and prednisolone treatment was
administered showed repolarisation disturbances. She collapsed, had
cardiac arrest and had to be resuscitated the same evening. The
patient was than transferred to ICU, where she was monitored until
the antiparasitic therapy was completed. Further ECGs showed some
ectopic ventricular depolarisations, but no episodes of ventricular
tachycardia occurred.
The clinical diagnosis was confirmed by serological testing in all 4
patients. All patients displayed elevated antibody titers against
_Trichinella spiralis_ in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
and immunoblot.
The tropism of _T. spiralis_ for striated muscle may lead to
involvement of the myocardium in 21-75 percent of infected patients.
Complications such as cardiac arrhythmias are considered the most
common cause of death associated with trichinellosis.

[ProMED-mail thanks Drs Kramme and Schmiedel for this interesting
case. It illustrates how infectious diseases spread over borders and
that Trichinellosis can be fatal. - Mod.EP]
