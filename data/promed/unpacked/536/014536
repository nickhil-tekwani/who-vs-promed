Thailand: Up to 100 Tigers in Sri Racha Zoo Now Affected by Avian Influenza
--------------------------------------------------
Up to 100 tigers may need to be culled to stop the bird-flu outbreak at Sri
Racha Tiger Zoo, Preecha Ratanaporn, a Director at the National Park,
Wildlife and Plant Conservation Department, said yesterday. Over 70 tigers
at the private zoo have succumbed to avian influenza, including 30 put down
on Wednesday to prevent the virus from spreading.

Lab tests yesterday showed the avian influenza virus that killed the big
cats at Sri Racha Zoo had not mutated, said Dr Charal Trinvuthipong,
Director of the government's bird-flu centre. But the virus that killed
the tigers [caused severe disease], and prompted an order from Charal for
it to be "decoded" to determine if it was the same H5N1 type already found
across the country or a new strain.

A further 25 tigers at the zoo suspected to be infected have been put under
surveillance, while 350 others that appear healthy and strong will also be
monitored. The tigers are being given medicine to prevent them catching the
virus, veterinarian Somchuan Ratanamangkalanont said. "This medicine is the
tablets that are given to humans to fight bird flu . We hope they can
control the spread of the virus at the zoo," he said. Tigers that look ill
will be immediately destroyed. "Tigers are prone get infections easily and
we need to watch them closely," he said.

Charal rejected reports that crocodiles at the Samut Prakan Crocodile Farm
and Zoo had perished from avian influenza, saying reptiles were not
susceptible to the avian virus. Only mammals such as dogs [?] and cats
could be affected, he said. Dr Thawat Suntrajarn, Director-general of the
Disease Control Department, also ruled out the possibility that the Samut
Prakan crocodiles had died from the virus. "The farm owner said crocodile
deaths are a normal phenomenon and they usually die every year," he said.

Thawat said the sick tigers at Sri Racha would be put down with lethal
injections that caused no pain. The 57 zookeepers who looked after the
animals have been asked to stay at home and visit the hospital daily for
physical check-ups. Aviaries in Songkhla have also been ordered to close
temporarily and are strictly banned from moving birds in and out, said
Chalerm-wut Kasetsomboon, Director of the Songkhla Zoological Office. The
aviaries are also prohibited from buying bird feed containing poultry.
Their workers have been told to watch their health. "Bird sanctuary
officials must fully cover their bodies to prevent infection, and they are
not allowed to touch bird droppings," Chalermwut said.

[The details of this incident are still rather confused. It is stated that
the virus has not "mutated", although it has still to be "decoded".
Presumably the treatment prescribed to protect healthy animals is
administration of the oral neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir. It appears
that the infection may be spreading now by the respiratory route, as the
supply of chicken carcasses has ceased. A fuller account is awaited.

ProMED-mail has received the following relevant information from Dr. Yang
Li <yangli@flu.org.cn> of F.I.C. (<http://www.flu.org.cn>). "A paper
published in China Journal of Veterinary Science in 2003 reported that
tigers died of influenza virus infection in 2002. The sequence of the NP
protein gene indicated an influenza A virus infection. Though the subtype
of the influenza A virus is not mentioned in the paper, phylogenetic
analysis showed great similarity between the NP gene of
A/Tiger/Harbin/2/2002 and A/duck anyang/AVL/1/2001(H5N1) and
A/goose/Guangdong/1/96(H5N1).
