Since May [2014], 5 cases of rabies have been identified in Jackson County, including 3 cases in raccoons between 12 Jul 2014 and 15 Jul 2014, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) wildlife specialist and rabies biologist Dana Johnson, who said the other 2 cases involved a fox from Scottsboro and a dog from Fabius. After coming into contact with the fox and the dog, some local residents had to undergo a series of post-exposure treatment shots that cost between USD 1600 and USD 2400 in total. As a result of these animals that tested positive for rabies, Johnson said Jackson County residents need to be more aware of animals potentially carrying the virus because possible exposure can be expensive and definite exposure is deadly.

According to Johnson, these cases all occurred within a 10-mile [16 km] radius, including 2 within 1.5 miles [2.4 km] of the Sentinel office in Scottsboro, and were the 1st reported cases of raccoon-variant rabies in this area. He said there are also bat-, coyote-, skunk-, and fox-variant rabies viruses and that this area had only previously experienced the bat-variant.

[In the USA, several wildlife variants of Lyssavirus exist, which circulate in bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes, and coyotes. Transmission rarely occurs between species, and these "spillover events" generally are not perpetuated in the recipient species.

While bat rabies is found throughout the USA, main terrestrial reservoirs differ depending on the geographical location. Raccoon rabies virus variant is present in the eastern United States (see map at http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/resources/publications/2012-surveillance/reservoirs.html).

It is very important to make sure to keep the vaccination status of all dogs and cats in the area up to date and not to approach wildlife with unusual behavior.
