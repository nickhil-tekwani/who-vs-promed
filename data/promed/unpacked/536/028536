China develops 1st live bird flu vaccine
---------------------------------------------
Chinese scientists have produced the world's 1st live vaccine against
bird flu and Newcastle disease, 2 killer infections for poultry, the
Ministry of Agriculture has announced.
The recombinant bivalent vaccine, developed by the Harbin Veterinary
Research Institute, will be a great boost to prevention and control
of the 2 epidemics in China as well as in the world, Chief Veterinary
Officer Jia Youling told a press conference in Beijing on Saturday
[24 Dec 2005]. In addition to injection, the vaccine can be
administered orally, nasally or by spraying, said Jia, also chief of
the ministry's Veterinary Bureau. The mass-application techniques can
not only significantly reduce labor costs, but also increase immunity
among fowl, Jia said. The shot will also be very inexpensive, as its
production cost is only 1/5th of that of the inactivated vaccines
available on the market, he said.
While most people are familiar with bird flu, Newcastle infections
are endemic to many countries. The latter is also a highly-contagious
viral disease affecting both domestic poultry and wild birds, experts
said, adding that chickens are the most susceptible. Chinese
scientists at the Harbin Institute in northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province spent 4 years to develop the powerful antidote [a term
usually applied in relation to toxins, not to infective agents. -
Mod.AS] to both Newcastle and bird flu, according to Jia.
Employing a technique called reverse genetics, the vaccine uses an
attenuated Newcastle vaccine strain, LaSota, as a vector, according
to Bu Zhigao, a chief scientist of the project.
Mass-production of the new vaccine was approved on 23 Dec 2005, and
by the end of this month [December 2005], one billion shots will have
been produced, he said.

China to launch new bird flu vaccine for poultry
-----------------------------------------------
China will begin mass-production of a new bird flu vaccine for
poultry by the end of the month, state media said on Monday [26 Dec
2005].
The new vaccine -- one billion shots of which are expected to have
been produced by year-end [2005] -- will be used alongside existing
vaccines from next year, the China Daily said, quoting chief
veterinarian Jia Youling.
The live vaccine, which will also work against another poultry
disease, Newcastle disease, can be delivered orally, nasally or by
spraying and will cost 1/5th of existing inactivated vaccines, the
newspaper said. Standard flu shots are inactivated, meaning the virus
is killed, but live vaccines contain weakened forms of the live virus.
Newcastle outbreaks killed almost 57 000 chickens in China in
September [2005], the report said.
An intensive poultry vaccination campaign and enforced quarantine of
bird flu outbreak areas have shown results in China's fight against
bird flu, state media said last week [4th week December 2005]. Only
one county -- out of 31 to have reported the H5N1 strain of bird flu
this year [2005] -- remained under isolation, and there had been no
new outbreaks for about 3 weeks, state media said.

Bu said experiments showed the vaccine can also protect mammals, such
as mice, from bird flu. [Details of the experiments will be
appreciated. - Mod.AS]
Mass-production of the new vaccine was approved on 23 Dec 2005, and
by the end of this month [December 2005], one billion shots will have
been produced, he said.
The vaccine will be used from the beginning of next year [2006]
alongside other vaccines, he said.
Intensive vaccination efforts have paid dividends in China's fight
against the fatal H5N1 strain of the bird flu virus.
By mid-December [2005], 6.85 billion domestic birds had been
vaccinated, including more than 5 billion since October [2005], Jia
said earlier. As a result, the country has reported only one case of
bird flu outbreak this month [December 2005].
China reported 6 human cases of bird flu this year [2005], involving
2 fatalities, and 31 outbreaks among poultry.
By last Thursday [22 Dec 2005], 30 out of 31 outbreak sites had been
lifted out of epidemic isolation, according to ministry sources. [An
updated map is available at
<http://europa.eu.int/comm/health/ph_threats/com/Influenza/ai_recent_en.htm>].
Figures on the latest Newcastle disease toll were not immediately available.
In a related development, the State Forestry Administration said on
Saturday [24 Dec 2005] that it would examine the performance of the
monitoring stations for wild-animal epidemic diseases across the
country.
The checks, lasting till 20 Feb 2006, will ensure that the 150
national stations and 402 provincial stations have contingency plans
and adequate information reporting mechanisms, according to deputy
director Zhao Xuemin.

[Provided the vaccine has been found safe (for the vaccinated birds
as well as for the vaccinators) and efficacious, as should have been
convincingly manifested in the laboratory and in controlled
experimental vaccinations in the field, this has the potential to
become a significant step forward in the combat against avian
influenza. Applying the oral (drinking water), nasal or aerosol
routes for mass-vaccination is a time and labor saving application
mode that might enable achieving China's ambitious undertaking to
vaccinate its 14 billion domestic poultry.
Hopefully, careful testing has preceded the official go-ahead
approval announced on 23 Dec 2005.
The current news stories seem to address a vaccine which has been
briefly described and discussed in a previous ProMED posting
(20051201.3468), where its possible similarities with another
recombinant NCD/AI vaccine were indicated [Swayne et al, 2003.
Recombinant paramyxovirus type 1-avian influenza-H7 virus as a
vaccine for protection of chickens against influenza and Newcastle.
Avian Dis. 47(3 Suppl):1047-50].
The American vaccine (rNDV-AI-H7) was constructed by using a
lentogenic paramyxovirus type 1 vector (Newcastle disease virus [NDV]
B1 strain, similar to LaSota) with insertion of the hemagglutinin
(HA) gene from avian influenza virus (AIV) A/chicken/NY/13142-5/94
(H7N2). This recombinant vaccine, regarded as "promising," was found
to render partial protection; the serologic response was weak in
birds that received only one vaccination.
The "attenuated Newcastle vaccine strain LaSota," reportedly used by
the Chinese as a vector, is rather similar to the B1 strain used by
the Americans. It will be interesting to note which HA gene was used
in the Chinese vaccine and to obtain data on the methods and results
of vaccine potency and challenge trials, which, hopefully, produced
better results than those obtained by the rNDV-AI-H7 vaccine. Details
which are of particular interest are: level and duration of
protection rendered in various age groups and in different species,
waterfowl included; minimal age for vaccination; time-schedule for
re-vaccinations; susceptibility to chemicals and climatic conditions,
when used in drinking water; safety requirements for the vaccinators.
