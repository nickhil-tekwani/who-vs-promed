On 4 Jun 2004, the National Veterinary Services
Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, confirmed the
finding of vesicular stomatitis (VS) in horses at
one premises in the State of New Mexico.
VS is a viral disease which primarily affects
horses, cattle, and swine. The virus that causes
VS has a wide host range. VS also occasionally
affects sheep and goats. In affected livestock,
VS virus causes blister-like lesions to form in
the mouth and on the dental pad, tongue, lips,
nostrils, hooves, and teats. These blisters
swell and break, leaving raw tissue that is so
painful that infected animals generally refuse to
eat and drink and show signs of lameness. Severe
weight loss usually follows, and in dairy cows, a
severe drop in milk production commonly occurs.
Affected dairy cattle can appear to be normal and
will continue to eat about half of their [normal] feed
intake.
On 26 May 2004, a foreign animal disease
investigation was initiated at a farm [in/near]
Carlsbad, NM due to a report of tongue lesions in
2 horses on the premises. There are 2 additional
horses, 2 steers, and some sheep and goats on the
infected premises that show no signs of lesions.
Serum was taken from all horses on the premises
and submitted to NVSL for testing.
After the 1st round of testing, one horse was CF
positive and 3 horses were cELISA positive for
antibodies to the New Jersey strain of VS virus.
The 2nd set of serum samples from the horses were
received by NVSL on 3 Jun 2004.
Results from the 2nd set of serum samples were
consistent with the case definition for VS, which
is based on compatible clinical signs and
appropriate laboratory confirmation, which may
include virus isolation or a 4-fold increase in
complement fixation (CF) or serum neutralization
titer in paired sera collected at least 7 days
apart.
The infected premises have been placed under
quarantine. There is no history of exposure and
no recent herd additions.
Veterinary Services and New Mexico Department of
Agriculture will continue to monitor the
situation and conduct response activities in an
effort to minimize trade restrictions.
Please forward this information to your federal,
State, and industry counterparts as necessary.

Staff at 800-940-6524.
