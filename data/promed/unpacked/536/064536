On-the-spot fines will soon be issued to home owners who allow mosquitoes
to breed on their properties, after dengue infections reached a 10-year
high, Singapore's Environment Ministry has announced.
This year 8597 infections of the potentially fatal tropical disease have
been reported, nearly double the 4788 last year [2003] and the highest in a
decade, the National Environment Agency said in a statement.
Starting in February [2005], home owners whose properties have become
breeding grounds for mosquitoes will be fined Singapore $100 (US $80) on
the spot.
Fines will be doubled for subsequent offences, said the agency. Earlier
this year, a Singapore man was fined $S6000 for leaving a water-filled
plastic pail lid outside his house.
