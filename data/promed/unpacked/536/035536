WEST NILE VIRUS, SURVEILLANCE - CANADA

Canadian health officials are using flocks of sentinel chickens as they
step up efforts to watch for signs that West Nile virus is moving north
across the border. As well, four veterinary schools in Canada will be on
the lookout for dead birds, which [when they were alive] could be carriers
of the potentially fatal virus. Last year, 62 people in New York city
[became ill after being infected with] the virus, seven died - including
that of one elderly Peel Region man who contracted the virus while on
vacation in that city.
The chickens will be strategically located in coops of 10 from Saskatchewan
across to Atlantic Canada, said Dr. Harvey Artsob, Chief of Zoonotic
Diseases at the Laboratory Centre for Disease Control in Winnipeg. "We put
them out in coops in various areas, where we strategically figure there
might be lots of mosquitoes. If the virus has come up to Canada, (it) may
have gone into those particular areas because [they are] near migratory
bird sites," Artsob said in a phone interview from Winnipeg.
The chickens act as sitting ducks, waiting to get bitten by mosquitoes.
They will be in place by mid-May and their watch won't be complete until
the first frost.
Weekly blood samples will be taken from the chickens, in search of evidence
of the virus. The chickens themselves do not get sick from West Nile virus,
Artsob said. There is absolutely no evidence of the virus in Canada, and
federal and provincial authorities say they are stepping up monitoring
strictly as a precautionary measure. "There is nothing to be concerned
about," said Health Canada spokesperson Margot Geduld. It is often
difficult to detect the virus in humans because most people only develop
mild, flu-like symptoms, such as fever, head and body aches. But in the
elderly, the virus can be deadly, causing severe illness that includes
confusion, neck stiffness, loss of consciousness and even paralysis.
Health Canada encourages Canadians to take the usual steps to avoid
mosquito bites. And it says people can help get rid of mosquito breeding
sites by removing garbage, and eliminating standing water in pool covers,
flower pots, old tires and children's toys. Health authorities are also
asking people finding dead or sick birds to report them to the natural
resources ministry. After they are collected, they'll be sent to the
veterinary schools for examination. Besides the outbreak in New York, there
was a large outbreak of West Nile in Russia, Artsob said.
"In Europe, it is rare to work its way up to the temperate climate of
Romania and Russia," he said. Unfamiliarity with the virus in North America
means scientists are unsure of how it will behave here, he added. The virus
was found in mosquitoes in New York state "Our first concern was whether it
is going to stay on the continent over winter. Since it was active last
fall, would it die out after the mosquitoes stop flying?" To that end, U.S.
health officials recently reported they have found traces of the West Nile
virus in New York state among mosquitoes wintering in the area. American
researchers from [Fort Collins division of the] Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention say they aren't sure what it means to find traces of the
virus in wintering mosquitoes. The researchers said the findings could be
misleading because the test used to detect the virus is new, very sensitive
and experimental.

[We post this simply to pass on the information that Harvey Artsob and his
group and heading appropriate surveillance mechanisms. The writing of this
report needed more editing than I gave it but I particularly enjoyed the
"chickens acting as sitting ducks" phrase. Keep writing like that and the
reporter will get egg on her face.
As for the final statement, that "the findings could be misleading because
the test used to detect the virus is new, very sensitive and experimental",
I hope that is a misquote. CDC has reported that West Nile virus RNA was
detected in overwintering mosquitoes in the Borough of Queens, New York
City, and my understanding is that they later isolated the virus. Virus
isolation is not misleading. - Mod. CHC]
