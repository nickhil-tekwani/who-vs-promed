Health officials studying mumps case
------------------------------------
An Allentown, Pennsylvania, child has contracted mumps but it is
unclear if the case is connected to a multi-state outbreak of the
contagious virus in the Northeast, health officials said Thursday [1
Apr 2010]. The child, who was not identified, has swollen glands and
other symptoms associated with mumps, said Allentown Health Bureau
Director Vicky Kistler. Health officials are investigating how the
child became ill. "We want to make sure we don't have an outbreak
here locally," Kistler said.

So far, the child's case does not appear to be connected to other
confirmed cases in the state, Kistler said. As of last week, the
state Department of Health was reporting 3 cases of mumps in
southeastern Pennsylvania. Those cases were associated with a
national outbreak, primarily affecting Hasidic Jewish populations
from New York and New Jersey. The outbreak is the largest in the U.S.
since 2006, when almost 6600 cases were reported in six Midwestern
states. In a normal year, about 300 cases are reported nationwide.

As of last week, there were 2903 cases of mumps reported nationally
since an outbreak began last summer in a boys camp in the Catskill
Mountains, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Mumps typically start with a few days of fever, headache, muscle
aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite, and is followed by swelling
of glands in the neck. Anyone who is not immune from either previous
mumps infection or from vaccination can get mumps. But vaccination
isn't a guarantee against contracting mumps. In New York, almost all
of those infected had received mumps vaccine, which suggests that
crowded households and close contact in schools can sometimes
overwhelm the protective effects of immunization.

Kistler advised parents to monitor children for symptoms. Parents who
suspect their children have mumps should keep them away from others
and seek medical attention, calling doctors in advance so infected
children don't sit in crowded waiting rooms.

Before the routine vaccination program was introduced in the U.S.,
mumps was common in infants, children and young adults. Now that most
people are vaccinated, mumps has become rare in the United States.
"We have a community that tends to be well vaccinated against mumps,"
Kistler said.

[Theses reports appear to record sporadic outbreaks of mumps virus
infection unconnected to the major outbreak originating in New York
state. The New York state outbreak subsequently spreading to adjacent
states and eventually abroad to Quebec and Israel, mainly through the
movement of students attending Yeshiva schools.
