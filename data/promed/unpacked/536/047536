The Ohio State University said Thursday night [6 Mar 2014] 9 students on campus have mumps and they suspect 2 more cases. The Columbus [Ohio] health department will investigate the suspected cases on Friday [7 Mar 2014]. Officials are investigating to determine how the disease has been spread at the school.

A total of 4 male students have reported cases, and 5 female students have come down with the mumps. 10TV has confirmed one case is a member of the Sigma Chi Fraternity. The fraternity declined to comment. The ages of those infected range from 19 to 22.

10TV learned about the outbreak around 2:00 p.m. The university sent out a warning letter to students and staff around 9:30 p.m.

Mumps is a viral infection that affects the salivary glands. The illness usually lasts around 7-10 days. It is highly contagious and can rapidly spread among members living in close quarters. For all Ohio State students, the Wilce Student Health Center is available. Visit the website at http://shs.osu.edu/ for hours of operation and a list of additional facilities that provide medical care off campus and after hours.

Local health officials say the Ohio State University mumps outbreak continues to afflict more students. Columbus Public Health officials say the number of confirmed cases of mumps now totals 13. A total of 7 women and 6 men between the ages of 18 and 22 have tested positive for the highly contagious disease.

CPH medical director Doctor Mysheika Williams Roberts said the majority of the students who have mumps report receiving their childhood vaccinations.

"The mumps component of the MMR vaccine has traditionally been known to be 80-90 percent effective, so it's not unusual," Roberts said, for some people to contract the disease. "And when they've had other large outbreaks of this size or larger at college campuses, we have seen a considerable number of cases who were vaccinated." Roberts expects the number of cases to increase. She said at this time all students are recovering at home.

Mumps causes swelling of salivary glands and flu-like symptoms. It can lead to infertility in men, and women can have ovarian swelling. The disease also can lead to viral meningitis.

[Mumps is a contagious infection that is caused by the mumps virus (family Paramyxoviridae). Mumps is spread in respiratory droplets, and the incubation period is 14-25 days (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/mumps.pdf). As many as 20 percent of mumps infections are asymptomatic. An additional 40 to 50 percent may have only nonspecific symptoms. The illness is characterized by low-grade fever, headache, and myalgias, followed by swelling and tenderness of salivary glands, usually the parotid gland. Complications include orchitis, oophoritis, meningitis, and pancreatitis. Mumps has also been associated with sudden onset of unilateral sensorineural deafness in children that may rarely be permanent and may be associated with vestibular symptoms (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3767776).

The mumps vaccine was licensed in 1967 and is usually administered as part of a combination vaccine that provides protection against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr4708.pdf). Live mumps virus vaccines in the United States are derived from the Jeryl Lynn mumps vaccine strain. Post-licensure studies in the United States demonstrated that 1 dose of mumps vaccine was 78-91 percent effective in preventing clinical mumps with parotitis; a study from the United Kingdom indicated a vaccine effectiveness of 88 percent for 2 doses of MMR vaccine compared with 64 percent for a single dose (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5522a4.htm). The MMR vaccine in the United States is given in 2 doses: The 1st dose is given at 12-15 months of age and the 2nd dose before entering school, at 4-6 years of age (http://www.vaccines.gov/diseases/mumps/index.html).

Nevertheless, mumps outbreaks among vaccinated populations have been reported frequently during recent years, especially among college students where the intensity of exposure among students was presumed to have overcome the vaccine-induced immunity (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/4/13-1681_article.htm).

The American College Health Association has recommended that colleges and universities require that students have documented receipt of 2 doses of MMR vaccine or have other acceptable evidence of measles, rubella, and mumps immunity before enrollment (http://www.acha.org/publications/docs/acha_ripi_mar2011.pdf). Immune globulin is not effective postexposure prophylaxis (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/mumps.pdf). In an outbreak setting, MMR vaccine might reduce transmission to susceptible persons not yet exposed to the mumps virus. The CDC has evaluated use of a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine for mumps outbreak control during 2 previous mumps outbreaks in which transmission was sustained, despite high 2-dose coverage (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6148a2.htm). During both outbreaks, targeted vaccination was followed by a decrease in mumps incidence among the target group.

The Ohio State University (OSU) is a large public research university in Columbus, Ohio, with about 28 000 undergraduates and more than 35 on-campus residence halls, with additional separate housing for graduate and professional students, plus multiple extra-curricular organizations where social mixing can occur (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_University). Columbus is the capital of and the largest city in the US state of Ohio. This city can be found on a map of the state of Ohio at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:OHMap-doton-Columbus.svg. -Mod.ML
