Further Information on Yellow Fever in Senegal
----------------------------------------------
Yellow fever is endemic in Senegal. In 1995 and 1996, 2 successive
epidemics of Yellow fever in the districts of Koungheul and Kaffrine (in
the center of the country) confirmed the existence of a continuous
circulation of the yellow fever virus in this zone of Senegal. Since
December 1997 a surveillance system was set up for the early detection of
cases.
This surveillance is carried out jointly by the Ministry of Health and the
Pasteur Institute of Dakar, [which is the laboratory of reference for
arboviruses in [Senegal. The area under surveillance covers 9 medical
districts of the regions of Fatick, Diourbel, Kaolack and Louga, in the
center of the country. All the health posts and centers in this area must
notify all cases of febrile icterus, whether accompanied by hemorrhage or
not, [which develop in less than 15 days, and [any unexplained deaths.
For all [cases conforming to this definition the nurse must take a digital
blood sample and address it, accompanied by a clinical information sheet,
to the Arbovirus Laboratory of the Pasteur Institute of Dakar. The Pasteur
Institute sends by mail or telephone the results of the analyses to the
health post or center that [reported the case and to the National Service
of Great Endemies (SNGE). A positive sample, indicated by the presence of
yellow fever IgM antibody, initiates an epidemiological investigation.
Within this framework, when the epidemic of yellow fever in Guinea was
confirmed, the Ministry for the Health of Senegal launched a vaccination
campaign in the districts of Velingara and Tambacounda, in the border
villages with Guinea, to create a buffer zone. Vaccine was left in the
health posts in the area to ensure the coverage of all subjects crossing
the border [who had not been vaccinated on the Guinea side. The
surveillance system was very rapidly set up in the districts of Tambacounda
and Velingara, [which allowed the identification of 3 cases of yellow
fever in a frontier village with Guinea, confirmed by the Pasteur Institute
of Dakar. The cases were all children. They were 2 young girls 10 years and
4 years old who had a favorable [outcome. Their vaccine status could not
be specified. The third was an [unvaccinated 17 month-old-boy [who died on
the 15 Dec 2000. Other cases [have not been observed since then.
The vaccination campaign [initiated in response to awareness of the
developing epidemic in Guinea made it possible to [prevent the disease
[crossing the border.
