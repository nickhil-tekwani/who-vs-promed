The 1st positive case of yellow fever (YF) was registered in a
patient in the Department of Concepcion. The patient is a 32-year-old
teacher in this district, located 100 km from the border with Brazil
and San Estanislao, San Pedro department, the area that had the 1st
cases of the disease.

The patient, according to the director of the 1st Health Region, Dr.
Clara Zorrilla, is recovering after rigorous treatment provided since
early this month [February 2008].

The director noted that this is a case imported from the area of
Asuncion, originating from when the teacher traveled on 14-16 Jan
2008 to the cities of Caacupe, San Lorenzo and the capital of the country.

"Returning from his trip, he started to feel dizzy and febrile, and
was treated in Pedro Juan Caballero and finally Yby Yau," the
Regional Health Director said.

She added that the analysis carried out on the patient was positive
yesterday [15 Feb 2008], and as a result, today [16 Feb 2008], a
massive control and prevention campaign for the disease will be
launched for the San Ramon de Yby Yau neighborhoods and vicinities.
It is expected that 3000 doses of [YF] vaccine will be available. Yby
Yau has a population of 11 000 inhabitants. [Will 3000 doses of
vaccine be enough to cover the town population? Some individuals may
have been vaccinated previously. - Mod.TY]
