Ohio State University's soybean sentinel plot program, established in 2005
to track soybean rust (still a no-show in Ohio), is fulfilling its purpose
as the 1st line of defense against more immediate, threatening diseases.
One of those is frogeye leaf spot.
The foliar disease, rare in Ohio, was recently identified at one of the 45
sentinel plot locations. "This is one of the clear benefits of this
sentinel plot program. We can find and detect a disease long before
controls need to be implemented," said Anne Dorrance, an Ohio State
University plant pathologist with the Ohio Agricultural Research and
Development Center.
Dorrance, who also holds an Ohio State University Extension appointment,
was one of several university researchers instrumental in establishing the
national program of sentinel plots. The early detection of frogeye is
helpful for growers who can now begin scouting their fields for any
potential problems. Although uncommon in Ohio, the disease has been showing
up more frequently the past several seasons, and can greatly impact on
susceptible soybean varieties.
Last year [2006] was the 1st time growers suffered economic losses to
frogeye -- anywhere from 10 per cent to 30 per cent yield losses on 300 000
acres (121 406 hectares). "The good news is we scored varieties in the
Soybean Variety Performance Trials last year [2006], and over 90 per cent
of the entries had high levels of resistance," said Dorrance. "We don't
expect a similar economic problem this year [2007], but it is good to
monitor the situation."
The frogeye pathogen survives in crop residue and makes its appearance in
mid to late July, affecting leaves and sometimes spreading to stems and
pods. Frogeye lesions are distinct from other soybean foliar diseases in
that they have a gray-silver center surrounded by a cranberry-red border.
Growers can manage frogeye by
- practising tillage to bury crop residue and reduce the amount of disease
inoculum,
- practising crop rotation, and by
- planting resistant varieties.
"Conditions for the next few weeks are predicted to be hot and dry. Frogeye
requires moisture and tends to infect young new leaves as opposed to older
leaves," said Dorrance. "For the next few weeks we will be surveying the
state to determine how widespread this is and if fungicides will be needed."

[Frogeye leaf spot is caused by the fungus _Cercospora sojina_, which can
infect leaves, stems, and seeds of soybean. The pathogen is found worldwide
but is only problematic under warm, humid conditions. Significant yield
losses of 10 to 50 per cent are commonly associated with frogeye epidemics.
The fungus is spread via infected plant material and can also be seed borne
leading to inferior seed quality. It is most likely to become a problem if
infected seed is planted or if infected residue of a previous soybean crop
serves as a source of inoculum. Disease management includes use of
disease-free seed, planting of resistant varieties, crop rotation, tillage,
and fungicide applications.
A close relative of the frogeye pathogen is _C. kukuchii_, which causes
leaf blight and purple seed stain on soybean. The genus _Cercospora_
includes a number of species causing leaf spot diseases on crops such as
grain legumes, carrot, eggplant, pepper, tomato, rice, corn, sorghum, oil
palm, and coffee. The related genus _Pseudocercospora_ also causes similar
leaf spot diseases on a different range of hosts, for example avocado and
grapevine.
Sentinel plots are experimental field plantings of indicator varieties of
the host crop and often include a number of cultivars with different
degrees of susceptibility to the pathogen. The plots are grown under
controlled conditions and with continuous observation. They are a useful
tool for early diagnosis of emerging crop diseases, and to identify the
need for appropriate disease management measures at a time when these would
be most effective.
