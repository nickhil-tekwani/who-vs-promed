The Upper West Regional Security Council has placed an indefinite ban on the movement, sale and slaughtering of all 4-legged animals in the Wa municipality due to an outbreak of anthrax in the municipality.

The Upper West regional Veterinary Officer, Dr. Paul Polkuun, who disclosed this to Citi News, said the ban is to protect people from contracting the disease and prevent its spread among animals. "You know anthrax is such that all other animals are susceptible to it, especially in our raining season. So what we had to do, knowing that all others are susceptible, was to place a complete ban on the movement of all animals and also a ban on the slaughter of such animals."

He said his outfit has received 10 000 out of the 30 000 doses it requires to commence mass vaccination of animals in the Wa municipality. He called on government and philanthropists to urgently help in providing the remaining 20 000 doses of the vaccines needed to complete the exercise.

Dr. Polkuun hinted that veterinary officers have been drawn from all districts in the region to come and help to carry out the exercise.

Meanwhile, Citi News can report that the ban has created an acute shortage of meat in the Wa municipality, with some meat sellers taking advantage of the situation.

Though Citi News' checks revealed [that while there was no] sale of meat at the Wa abattoir and the central market, some unscrupulous meat sellers were killing animals at unauthorized places and illegally selling the product to consumers.

This has attracted the attention of security personnel in the municipality who have since been undertaking unannounced visits to some food joints to destroy meat products.

However, some food sellers at the Wa market who were victims to the exercise expressed their frustrations about the ban and the decision by the security men to destroy their products. They accused the Security Council of blowing the anthrax incidence out of proportion.

[A woman] who sells food at the market said the veterinary officers should have taken more time to investigate the situation rather than imposing the ban on the whole municipality. She said the ban has adversely affected her sales, saying, "we have lived with this anthrax for long, we don't understand what they are doing. How can we sell food without meat? We can't continue to sit like this."

[Most anthrax activity in Ghana involves the Upper East province, but outbreaks are reported in the Upper West province; that is, in cattle in 2006 (2), 2011 (1), and 2012 (1), and in sheep and goats in 2011 (2 outbreaks with 37 cases).

So far we have heard only the anger from the meat markets. We would appreciate confirmation from our Ghanaian members of anthrax in the Upper West province. Whether this is a spillover from the Upper East or sporadic outbreaks in the Upper West is unclear.
