Russia: Alcohol Reform Blamed For Outbreak Of Poisonings
----------------
It kills some 40,000 people every year in Russia -- almost 5 per hour.
Russia's Interior Minister Rashid Nurgaliyev has called it a
"national tragedy."
And President Vladimir Putin sounded the alarm during a 3-hour
televised appearance on 25 Oct [2006].
"The profusion of poor-quality and counterfeit products on our
alcohol market is a huge problem," Putin said. "And even today we
have examples of poisoning of people through poor-quality alcohol.
Besides inflicting huge damages on people's health, which is the No.
1 problem, it also has a very negative impact on the state of public finances."
Stamping Out The Problem
Poisoning from tainted alcohol is not a new problem in Russia. But
lately, the country's hospitals have been struggling to cope with the
flow of alcohol-poisoning victims.
Toxic hepatitis, a disease brought on by the consumption of
poor-quality alcohol, has killed scores of Russians over the past few weeks.
Hundreds of people are currently hospitalized, many in severe
condition. Doctors say toxic hepatitis, which can cause severe liver
damage, is difficult to treat and often fatal.
Like many observers, Oleg Zykov, the director of the "No To
Alcoholism And Drug Abuse" foundation in Moscow, is already talking
about a nationwide epidemic.
In Pskov Oblast, where alcohol poisoning has killed 16 people and
affected almost 450, local authorities have introduced a state of emergency.
"It is obvious that a tragedy is taking place," Zykov said. "We have
seen this tragedy double, triple lately. Today, it clearly has the
characteristic of a sudden epidemic, and this was to be expected.
Half a year ago, when the process of changing excise stamps started,
I said that the number of poisonings from surrogates would definitely
grow. We will have an epidemic of poisoning from substitutes."
Under a new law introduced this year to combat bootlegging, all
alcoholic beverages in Russia must now carry a new excise stamp and a barcode.
But delays and glitches during the implementation of the new rules
resulted in alcoholic beverages disappearing from shelves for many weeks.
Failed Reform?
Aleksandr Nikishin, a vodka historian and director of a vodka museum
in Moscow, says the spate of poisonings is a direct result of the
alcohol reform.
"It all started when factories were stalled, when there were no
excise stamps, when shelves and shops were empty. Some clearly saw
the possibility of filling the niche of illegal manufacturer,"
Nikishin said. "But someone has produced a very low-quality
substitute. Usually people don't get poisoned and die like that with
substitutes. This is an extraordinary case."
The figures indeed look like a frontline casualty report.
In Chelyabinsk Oblast, in the Urals, poisonous alcohol has killed 70
people, and more than 1200 have sought medical assistance over the
past two months.
In Perm Krai, 9 people have died and 15 are in critical condition; 30
have died in Irkutsk Oblast; 21 in Kirov Oblast; and 45 in the
western Belgorod Oblast.
In Pskov Oblast, where alcohol poisoning has killed 16 people and
affected almost 450, local authorities have introduced a state of emergency.
Unsavory Ingredients
For years, fake vodka producers used products containing industrial
spirits such as detergents, antifreeze, and window-cleaning solutions.
The authorities hoped that the alcohol reform, by slapping a tax on
industrial spirits, would curb bootleg vodka production and bring
down the number of alcohol-poisoning deaths.
But the new legislation seems to have had the opposite effect.
Pavel Shapkin, the chairman of the National Alcohol Association, told
RFE/RL's Russian Service that the alcohol shortage caused by the
reform has prompted counterfeiters to resort to other, untaxed,
spirits -- usually alcohol-based medicine and antiseptics sold in pharmacies.
Shapkin says these substances are even more toxic than industrial spirits.
"Those who produced fake vodka with antifreeze -- and this is a whole
industry -- started looking for new raw material," Shapkin said.
"Surrogate producers got hold of liquids that, in addition to ethyl
alcohol, contain highly toxic substances. The alcohol contained in
antiseptics must cost as much as much as alcohol in vodka bottles.
Then nobody will dream of using this alcohol to produce substitute alcohol."
"It all started when factories were stalled, when there were no
excise stamps, when shelves and shops were empty." -- vodka historian
Compounding the problem is the cheap price tag carried by a bottle of
fake liquor.
With the introduction of the more expense excise stamps, which has
pushed up the price of vodka and other spirits, many are seeking a
cheaper substitute.
Cheap Vodka, Bad Vodka
Nikishin says the only way of reducing the number of poisoning deaths
is teaching the population that cheap vodka is bad vodka.
"People simply need to be informed and explained that vodka can't be
cheap, because excises are expensive," Nikishin said. "From a bottle
that costs 100 rubles, the excise represents 70 rubles, the bottle
with the label costs 10 rubles, the alcohol costs a little bit, the
workforce also, and the rest represents a small benefit. If a bottle
costs 50 or 40 rubles, you'd better run away from it."
A half-liter bottle of bootleg vodka costs as little as 20 rubles (USD 0.75).
By contrast, the cheapest bottle of officially approved vodka now
costs 95 rubles (USD 3.50). The same bottle cost 65 rubles (UDS 2.4)
before the labeling reform was ushered in on 1 Jan [?2006].

[Some regulations have exactly the opposite effect of what was
intended. This looks like one of those cases. It appears from this
article that this is indeed an increasing poisonings and not a case
of increased reporting. -Mod.TG]
