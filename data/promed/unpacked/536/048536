[The Indonesian notification deals with outbreaks which had taken
place months ago, but this might have been caused by the
time-consuming diagnostic procedures, which were -- reportedly --
finalised during the 1st week of June.

The previous (No 13) follow-up report from Vietnam was received by
the OIE on 28 Feb 2005 (see 20050305.0669). If the current
information reflects the situation on the ground, no outbreaks of
HPAI in avians have occurred (or detected and confirmed) there
between 28 Feb and 10 Jun 2005.

All accumulated reports can be found in OIE's update of 1 Jul 2005:
<http://oie.int/downld/AVIAN%20INFLUENZA/A_AI-Asia.htm>.

The update includes a graph, according to which the total accumulated
number of H5N1 outbreaks in Viet Nam and Indonesia as of 1 Jul 2005
is 1838 and 216, respectively. - Mod.AS]
