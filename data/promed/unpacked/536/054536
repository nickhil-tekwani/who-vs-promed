The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, GA,
is working collaboratively with state health departments, the
American Association of Poison Control Centers, and the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) on reports of adverse health effects
following consumption of the dietary supplement "Total Body Formula,"
and "Total Body Mega Formula" manufactured in the USA exclusively for
Total Body Essential Nutrition, Inc. This dietary supplement has been
found by the FDA to contain hazardous levels of selenium (up to 200
times the label value) and chromium (up to 17 times the label value).

An FDA press release on 9 Apr 2008 detailed information regarding the
level of selenium in the product
(<http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2008/NEW01818.html>). The FDA is
advising consumers to stop using "Total Body Formula" in flavors
Tropical Orange and Peach Nectar and "Total Body Mega Formula" in the
Orange/Tangerine flavor and discard them by placing them in a trash
receptacle outside of the home. "Total Body Formula" products are
sold in 8-ounce and 32-ounce plastic bottles. "Total Body Mega
Formula" is sold in 32-ounce plastic bottles.

Products with the following lot numbers should be discarded: Total
Body Tropical Orange with lot numbers 4016801, 4024801 and 4031801;
Total Body Peach Nectar with lot numbers 4016802 and 4031802; and
Total Body Mega Orange/Tangerine with lot number 4031803.

As of 11 Apr 2008, 91 adverse reactions have been reported from
Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Virginia
health departments. The American Association of Poison Control
Centers and the FDA report additional exposures in other states.

Total Body Essential Nutrition, Inc reportedly distributed this
product to 16 states (Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia),
and also sells its products over the Internet.

Clinical description of selenium toxicity
-----------------------------------------
Excessive intake of selenium is known to cause the following
symptoms: significant hair loss, muscle cramps, diarrhea, joint pain,
fatigue, loss of finger nails and blistering skin.

Clinical description of chromium toxicity
-----------------------------------------
Excessive intake of chromium may result in the following symptoms:
renal failure, elevated hepatic enzymes, thrombocytopenia, hemolysis,
changes in thought processes, gastrointestinal disorders, chest pain,
erythema/flushing/rash, dizziness, headache, agitation, and
rhabdomyolysis.

Case definition
---------------
Individuals presenting with 2 or more of the following symptoms that
occurred within 2 weeks of ingesting a dietary supplement
manufactured in the USA exclusively for Total Body Essential
Nutrition, Inc: hair loss, muscle or joint pains, fingernail
discoloration or changes, headache, foul breath, weakness,
gastrointestinal symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or
abdominal pain), rash, oliguria/anuria or abnormal renal function
tests, jaundice or abnormal liver function tests, anemia or
hematological changes.

The CDC requests that consumers and clinicians who encounter patients
with symptoms consistent with selenium and/or chromium poisoning
report these cases to their local poison control center (PCC) at
1-800-222-1222. Medical personnel are available at PCCs to provide
specific medical management advice and will make appropriate referral
to state and local health authorities.

Health care professionals and consumers are also encouraged to report
adverse events to the FDA's MedWatch program at 800-FDA-1088 or

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced today that it
has found hazardous levels of selenium in samples of certain flavors
of the dietary supplement products "Total Body Formula" and "Total
Body Mega Formula." The FDA has received 43 reports of persons from 9
states who experienced serious adverse reactions using these products.

On 27 Mar 2008, the FDA warned consumers not to purchase or use
"Total Body Formula" in flavors Tropical Orange and Peach Nectar and
"Total Body Mega Formula" in the Orange/Tangerine flavor of these
products after receiving reports of adverse reactions in users in
Florida and Tennessee
(http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2008/NEW01812.html). The adverse
reactions generally occurred after 5 to 10 days of daily ingestion of
the product, and included significant hair loss, muscle cramps,
diarrhea, joint pain, deformed fingernails, and fatigue.

Selenium, a naturally occurring mineral, is needed only in very small
amounts for good health. Selenium can boost the immune system.
Generally, normal consumption of food and water provides adequate
selenium to support good health. Excessive intake of selenium is
known to cause symptoms to include significant hair loss, muscle
cramps, diarrhea, joint pain, fatigue, loss of finger nails and
blistering skin.

Presently, the FDA has 43 reports of adverse reactions including
cases from Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, New Jersey,
North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.

Analyses of samples of the products by FDA laboratories have now
found most of the samples contain extremely high levels of selenium
-- up to 40 800 micrograms per recommended serving, or more than 200
times the amount of selenium per serving (i.e., 200 micrograms)
indicated on the labels of the products. The FDA continues to
investigate the matter to determine how excessive amounts of selenium
were added to the products.

The FDA is advising consumers to stop using "Total Body Formula" in
flavors Tropical Orange and Peach Nectar and "Total Body Mega
Formula" in the Orange/Tangerine flavor and discard them by placing
them in a trash receptacle outside of the home. "Total Body Formula"
products are sold in 8-ounce and 32-ounce plastic bottles. "Total
Body Mega Formula" is sold in 32-ounce plastic bottles. Both product
lines are distributed by Total Body Essential Nutrition of Atlanta,
which is listed on the products' labels.

Consumers who have been taking the products and have experienced
adverse reactions should consult their health care professional.
Consumers and health care professionals are encouraged to report
adverse events to the FDA's MedWatch program at 800-FDA-1088 or
online at
<http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/how.htm>.

The sole distributor of the "Total Body Formula" and "Total Body Mega
Formula" products has voluntarily recalled the affected products.
According to the company, the products were distributed nationwide.

[The FDA metals lab identifies selenium and chromium as toxic elements.

Selenium is a trace mineral essential to good health but is required
only in small amounts. High blood levels of selenium (greater than
100 ug/dL) can result in a condition called selenosis [1]. Symptoms
of selenosis include gastrointestinal upsets, hair loss, white
blotchy nails, garlic breath odor, fatigue, irritability, and mild
nerve damage [2].

Selenium toxicity is rare in the U.S. The few reported cases have
been associated with industrial accidents and a manufacturing error
that led to an excessively high dose of selenium in a supplement
[3,4]. The Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences
has set a tolerable upper intake level (UL) for selenium at 400
micrograms per day for adults to prevent the risk of developing
selenosis [5].

Chromium is a mineral that humans require in trace amounts, although
its mechanisms of action in the body and the amounts needed for
optimal health are not well defined. It is found primarily in 2
forms: 1) trivalent (chromium 3+), which is biologically active and
found in food, and 2) hexavalent (chromium 6+), a toxic form that
results from industrial pollution.
