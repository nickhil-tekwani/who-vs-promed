The epidemiology of botulism in Canada is rather unique. Botulism is
primarily encountered among the First Nations and Inuit people. Most cases in
recent years have been caused by fermented salmon roe ('stink eggs' or 'gink')
in British Columbia; and fermented sea mammal meat among the Inuit.
Two cases were reported in 1980; 4 in 1981; 6 in 1982; 7 in 1983; 9 in 1984;
32 in 1985 (25 of these in British Columbia); 6 in 1986; 26 in 1987 (18 in
Quebec); 5 in 1988; 7 in 1989; 4 in 1990.
Nine cases were reported in 1991 (6 of these from the Northwest Territories,
for a rate of 11/100 000 population); 9 in 1992; 3 in 1993; 3 in 1994 (from
Northwest Territories).
14 cases were reported in 1996 (10 of these from Quebec); 18 in 1997 (11 from
Quebec) - including 1 of infant botulism; 7 in 1998; 8 in 1999 (3 Quebec, 2
Northwest Territories); 4 in 2000 (1 Northwest Territories); 6 in 2001.
Seven outbreaks (16 cases - none fatal) and 1 case of infant botulism were
reported in 1995 - implicated foods included fermented fat of marine mammals),
seal, walrus and marinated/smoked fish.
Five outbreaks of foodborne botulism (10 patients - no fatalities) were
reported in 1996 - implicated foods included seal, fermented fish, and beluga
whale. Seven outbreaks (18 cases; 1 fatal) were reported in 1997 - including 9
cases in Quebec acquired from seal and 4 cases in the Northwest Territories
acquired from beluga whale and caribou fat. Two outbreaks (4 cases, 1 fatal)
in British Columbia during 2001 were ascribed to fermented salmon roe.
