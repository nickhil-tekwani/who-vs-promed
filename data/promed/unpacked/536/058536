[Soybean rust, Asian strain is a very important disease caused by the
fungus _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_. One widespread naturalized host in
the Americas is the vine kudzu (_Pueraria lobata_), introduced as a
forage plant. - Mod.JW]
There are a number of management options to control kudzu.
Herbicides, grazing, prescribed burning, and disk harrowing can be
used as eradication or containment treatments. Kudzu patches can be
eradicated with persistent treatments or they can be contained and
managed with other treatment options. For eradication, every kudzu
plant in and around a patch must be killed or the spread from any
surviving plants can make all prior efforts and investments useless.
This means that all landowners sharing a patch must treat together.
Landowners often find herbicide applications the easiest means for
eradication and containment, but herbicides should only be applied
according to exact label instructions, requirements, and
prohibitions. Read, understand, and follow herbicide labels
completely before and during use. Commercial applicators can be
contracted to perform such applications, but the landowner must give
directions in most cases to be successful and cost-effective.
On open patches on level ground, most herbicides will brown kudzu
leaves and vines, but few will result in root control. Tordon 101
Mixture and Tordon K (see table at URL above for common names and
manufacturers) are the most cost-effective herbicides of the 25
tested on kudzu over an 8-year period. Both herbicides are applied as
sprays to the foliage and then must be washed from the leaves by
rainfall to the roots for uptake. Both of these are restricted-use
herbicides because they are very water-soluble and can leach through
sandy soils into streams and ground water, nearby trees with roots in
the area can be killed or injured, many crops are very sensitive to
these herbicides, and they are relatively persistent and may injure
or kill plants introduced into the area too soon. Because of this, a
permit for purchase is issued by your county agent or state
regulatory agency in the United States after proper use procedures
are reviewed. Kudzu is a legume, and Tordon herbicides are very
effective on leguminous plants. [ProMED has no financial or other
connections to the manufacturers of Tordon 101 Mixture or Tordon K.

With respect to biological control of kudzu, there is some
information. 6 fungal pathogens have been identified by collaborators
at South China Agricultural University (Jiang et al., 2000). One
Phycomycete (_Synchytrium puerariae_ P. Henning) Miyabe
(Chytridiaceae) may hold some potential as a biological control
agent. This pathogen has been reported on several Pueraria species
from Japan, New Guinea, Java, the Philippines, India, China, and
California (specimen at U.S. National Fungus Collection, Beltsville,
Maryland) (Karling, 1964), but further investigations are necessary
to confirm its host specificity.
Host Range Tests and Results
----------------------------
Preliminary host range testing with soybean and peanut were begun in
the summer of 2000. As far as possible, initial host testing will be
conducted in China, where quarantine facilities are not required for
these native insects. In the later screening stages, extensive
testing of American plants and crops will be conducted in U.S.
quarantine facilities to ensure host specificity before any insect
can be released.
Biological Control Using Pathogens Native to the United States
--------------------------------------------------------------
_Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. phaseolicola.
----------------------------------------
This bacterium is the causal agent of "halo blight" of bean and
kudzu, causing a small necrotic leafspot surrounded by a bright halo
of chlorotic tissue. Zidak and Backman (1996) reported that the
bacterium could kill 8- to 10-week-old kudzu seedlings, but produced
few, if any, secondary infections under fairly dry conditions in the
field.
_Myrothecium verrucaria_ (Moniliales).
--------------------------------------
This fungus has a fairly broad host range. Yang and Jong (1995)
reported good control of leafy spurge and 8 other Euphorbia species
using isolates of this fungus. Walker and Tilley found that an
isolate from sicklepod (_Senna obtusifolia_ [L.] Irwin and Barneby)
affected a number of important crops, ornamentals, and weeds,
representing 6 different families. Sprays directed to soybean stems
and lower leaves did not reduce soybean dry weight (Walker and
Tilley, 1997). It was patented for sicklepod biocontrol, and,
although originally isolated from sicklepod, it is even more
effective against kudzu. 2 years of testing in Mississippi
demonstrated that the fungus attacks leaves and stems, with greater
activity at 25 to 40 deg C than at 10 to 20 deg C. Field tests
demonstrated that 95 to 100 percent control could be achieved within
14 days of inoculation by girdling runner stems with this fungus,
which produces asexual spores in a sporodochium, with a matrix
suggesting dispersal by splashing rain. In inoculation studies, a
surfactant was needed for good infection (Boyette, 2000). A patent
for kudzu control has been applied for.
_Colletotrichum gloeosporiodes_ (Sphaeriales).
----------------------------------------------
A strain of this widely-distributed pathogen was isolated from kudzu
in Houston County, Georgia, and its virulence was increased by
repeated selection for growth on Czapek Dox medium amended with kudzu
extract. Field inoculations showed a synergistic effect was achieved
by inoculations of spores together with 20 percent of the recommended
rate of dicamba. The fungus attacks both leaves and vines, and
produces asexual spores in a pycnidium (Farris and Reilly, 2000).
