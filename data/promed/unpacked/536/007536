[Bovine anthrax has been reported to OIE virtually every year since 2000; in 2005 there were 39 outbreaks involving significant numbers of cattle and sheep; 46 in 2006; 54 in 2007; and 26 in 2008. Since then, the number of outbreaks have decreased but the numbers of livestock affected have stayed high, involving both cattle and sheep. Anthrax is a readily preventable disease if the livestock are vaccinated, especially in areas of high risk.
