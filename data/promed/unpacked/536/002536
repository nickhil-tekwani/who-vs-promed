According to the chief of the Department of the Ministry of Emergency
Situations in Moscow, on 10 Jan 2007, during a regular follow up on a
female resident from Serpuhov, it was determined that she was
affected by a mild case of typhoid fever. The same diagnosis was made
in another 2 residents of Serpuhov on 11 Jan 2007, when a woman and
her 5-year-old son were diagnosed. All 3 were hospitalized in the
infectious diseases hospital of Serpuhov.
The current condition of all 3 is satisfactory. 70 people who were in
contact with them were checked, and, so far, no new cases have been
identified. By 16 Jan 2007, 60 people were vaccinated out of the
contact cohort.

13 persons are being treated for diarrhea, while there are 2 cases of
typhoid fever in Barangays Buenavista and Poblacion, Bayugan, Agusan
del Sur. These do not include 12 cases of gastroenteritis with mild
dehydration also in the same areas, attributed to the continuous
rains of the past 4 weeks.
Agusan del Sur Information Officer Ferdinand Perez told the
Philippines News Agency that the Provincial Health Office will assist
barangay and municipal officials in containing the said illnesses
that hit Bayugan town at the start of 2007. Bayugan is one of the
most progressive and populated towns of Agusan del Sur, the largest
province of Caraga Region.

Four food outlets in the same suburb are being investigated as
possible sources of a typhoid outbreak. The disease, which is
transmitted by water and food contaminated by fecal bacteria, has
hospitalized 4 Clendon residents.
Authorities initially had trouble identifying a link between the
victims -- 2 teenagers and 2 middle-aged people -- who had no
connection other than where they lived. Three of the 4 had eaten at
the Clendon food outlets now under investigation.
Auckland Regional Public Health clinical director Julia Peters says
samples have been taken to eliminate premises and staff from the
investigation. She says none of the staff at the outlets had been ill
but that they would submit samples for testing.
Dr. Peters says the health service does not believe the 4th typhoid
case is related to the other 3. All 4 victims have been released from
hospital and are recovering at home. Since 1 Nov 2006, there have
been 17 cases of typhoid in the Auckland region. Normally, the
average is 20 cases per year.
