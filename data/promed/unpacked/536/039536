Wisconsin animal health officials have confirmed the state's 1st case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in a horse for 2018, the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported 27 Jul 2018.

"On [Thu 26 Jul 2018], the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection confirmed a case of eastern equine encephalitis in a 6-year-old unvaccinated Belgian mare from Washburn County," the EDCC said. "The mare presented with neurological signs and was examined on 20 Jul 2018. The horse died or was euthanized and brain tissue samples were submitted to the diagnostic laboratory on 21 Jul 2018."

A viral disease, EEE affects the central nervous system and is transmitted to horses by infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs of EEE include moderate to high fever, depression, lack of appetite, cranial nerve deficits (facial paralysis, tongue weakness, difficulty swallowing), behavioral changes (aggression, self-mutilation, or drowsiness), gait abnormalities, or severe central nervous system signs, such as head-pressing, circling, blindness, and seizures. The course of EEE can be swift, with death occurring 2 to 3 days after onset of clinical signs despite intensive care; fatality rates reach 75-80 percent among horses. Horses that survive might have long-lasting impairments and neurologic problems.

Vaccines have proven to be a very effective EEE prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot; in areas with a prolonged mosquito season, veterinarians might recommend 2 boosters annually -- one in the spring and another in the fall. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3- to 6-week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and applying mosquito repellents approved for equine use.

State health officials have identified eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in pools of mosquitoes collected in central Brunswick county last week [week of 16 Jul 2018].

The type of mosquitoes collected are responsible for circulating EEE in the wild bird population and are not known to bite humans.

County mosquito control officials regularly monitor the mosquito species _Culiseta melanura_ to identify EEE activity and direct mosquito spraying operations to reduce the risk to the human and horse populations.

Brunswick county officials are actively spraying for adult mosquitoes in the county and will continue to do so until the mosquito populations are reduced, but individuals should still take steps to minimize their exposure to mosquitoes during outside activities, especially during dusk and dawn.

Mosquito populations tend to be more active in wooded areas this time of year, limiting adult control options.

David Stanley, the county's Health and Human Services executive director, urges residents to wear light-colored, long-sleeved shirts and long pants, avoid being outside at dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most active, and apply mosquito repellant.

If using repellent with DEET, make sure to follow label instructions, and keep DEET out of the eyes, mouth, and nose.

If you are a horse owner, consult your veterinarian regarding proper protective vaccines for your horses and change the water in water troughs at least twice a week to discourage mosquito breeding.

For more information regarding mosquitoes or mosquito control activities in your area, please contact Brunswick County Mosquito Control Division at 910-253-2515 or click here to submit a mosquito control service request online.
