Officials point to wild ducks as cause of bird flu in Zonguldak
-------------------------------------------------------------
The governor of the northern province of Zonguldak has stated that
several chickens in a village in the province were contaminated with
a deadly strain of bird flu after they consumed a dead wild duck. In
a press conference held on Wednesday [23 Jan 2008], Zonguldak
Governor Yavuz Erkmen said the necessary measures had been taken to
contain a potential pandemic, and pointed to wild ducks as the source
of the disease.
"After a series of analyses, we found out that the disease broke out
after a family ate a wild duck and gave the leftovers to their
chickens. The H5N1 virus in the duck, which spread among the
chickens, is the cause of the bird flu case in our province," he said.
Officials from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs stated
on Monday [21 Jan 2008] that several dead chickens found in
Zonguldak's Saz village during a routine inspection conducted on 19
Jan 2008 tested positive for the bird flu virus. The village was
immediately put under quarantine, and teams from the local government
started culling poultry in the village.
"Some 600 chickens, ducks and turkeys have been culled so far.
Members of the family who consumed the wild duck in question are
currently receiving medical care. Everything is under control; thus,
there is nothing to fear," stated Erkmen.
Meanwhile, Azerbaijan has halted imports of meat and diary products
from Turkey, after the bird flu case in Zonguldak. Expressing they
cannot receive an official explanation from the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United States (FAO), Azerbaijani officials said
they have suspended importing meat and diary products from Turkey.

[I suspect that the domestic poultry were not given the leftovers
from the cooked wild duck but that the feathers, feet, and unused raw
viscera were tossed out into the yard, from which their domestic
chickens acquired the virus, if that were the route. An observant
reader will note however that no ducks have been tested. Only dead
domestic chickens have been tested and the Ministerial presumption
then made that it had all started from this culinary duck. There are
no reports of sick or dead wild ducks.
On the other hand in the earlier years of H5N1 the ducks were dying
at a high rate but in recent years that has changed, and now ducks
can be asymptomatic shedders of the virus; (see Songserm T, Jun-on R,
Sae-Heng N, Meemak N, Hulse-Post DJ, Sturm-Ramirez KM, et al.

Apr <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no04/05-1614.htm >) A common
and long standing epidemiologist problem is to invoke theory in the
absence of hard data. We have to look harder than take the easy
speculation route.
