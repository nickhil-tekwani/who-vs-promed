High mortality observed in wild birds in Iran
---------------------------------------------
Information received on (and dated) 12 Oct 2005 from Dr
Mansour Sayari, head of Iran Veterinary Organization,
Ministry of Jihad-e-Agriculture, Tehran:
Reason for immediate notification: an emerging disease with
significant morbidity or mortality or zoonotic potential.
A high mortality was observed in wild waterfowl (wild ducks)
at Poldasht, on the coast of Arras, West Azerbaijan
province.
No pathological agent has been identified yet. No postmortem
lesions are seen in dead birds; weakness and death are the
only evidence.
Date of start of the event: 2 Oct 2005.
Total number of deaths: 3673.
Source of outbreak or origin of infection: unknown or
inconclusive.
Control measures undertaken:
- quarantine;
- movement control inside the country;
- screening;
- zoning;
- disinfection of infected areas.
Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: the
negative laboratory tests do not mention for which disease
the diagnostic tests were negative. It is likely to be avian
influenza. A confirmation from the Veterinary Services of
this country has been requested.

[Although many people might think of avian influenza in this
instance because of the recent wild bird die offs in Lake
Erhel in northern Mongolia or China's Qinghai Lake, it
should be remember that wild bird die offs are caused by
many other factors. We have had many reports of botulism
from different countries, for example. The above report has
no diagnostic information but does mention postmortem and
some clinical findings, which are not said to be indicative
of avian influenza. We will just have to await further
information. In this situation, as in the recent case in
Turkey and Romania, it is of the utmost importance to have
the influenza H and N types identified before making
conclusions about global spread. - Mod.PC]
