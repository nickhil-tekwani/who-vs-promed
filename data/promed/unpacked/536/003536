Indonesia to kill pigs in fight against bird flu
------------------------------------------------
The Indonesian authorities will on Sunday [24 Jul 2005] slaughter some 200
pigs infected by bird flu in a village close to the hometown of the
country's first victims, 3 members of the same family who died this month.
Agriculture Ministry spokesman Hari Priyono said the pigs were in a village
near Tangerang, a satellite city of Jakarta located 20 miles from the
Indonesian capital. "First we will sedate them, then we kill them. After
that, we will burn and bury them," he said. "The virus will die when heat
reaches 80 degrees Celsius."
Officials have said there was no concrete evidence of contact between the
victims and the farm animals and that laboratory tests showed the strain
was not a new mutation allowing the disease to be passed between humans.
Health experts are still puzzled by the deaths in the world's 4th most
populous country, but the authorities have prepared 44 hospitals across
Indonesia for the treatment of further possible victims.
In a sprawling archipelago dotted with small farms, and where even many
urban families keep chickens, pinpointing the source of the virus is
proving difficult. Avian influenza, which arrived in Asia in late 2003, has
so far killed more than 50 people in the region, including Vietnam,
Thailand and Cambodia. In Indonesia, the virus has spread to 21 provinces
out of 33 over the past 2 years. It had already jumped species in
Indonesia, having been discovered in pigs on densely populated Java island
in May. Pigs can carry human flu viruses, which can combine with avian
viruses, swap genes and create virulent new strains. However, pig farming
is not widespread in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim country.
Islam regards pigs as unclean.

[Initial information on H5N1 in Indonesian pigs was provided in early April
2005 by Ca Nidom, a molecular biology researcher from the Centre for
Tropical Disease Control, Airlangga University, Surabaya, East Java, who
reportedly identified avian influenza virus in throat swabs and sera of
pigs by RT-PCR.
An official notification was later sent by the Indonesian Veterinary
Services to the OIE, namely on 23 May 2005 (see 20050601.1526). It said
that H5N1 AI virus was detected in nasal swabs from clinically sound pigs
in 2 locations within the Tangerang district, Banten province, West Java.
Out of 26 swabs sampled on 23 Feb 2005, 14 Apr 2005 and 26 Apr 2005, 12
were -- reportedly -- found positive. It further stated that "partial
stamping out" was "to be undertaken". Thus far, no clinical cases in pigs
have been reported from Indonesia.
The 1st fatal human case in Indonesia related to a patient (1 year old
girl) "from the outskirts of Jakarta" admitted to a hospital in Tangerang,
about 25 km (15.5 miles) west of Jakarta, on 7 Jul 2005, for high fever and
respiratory problems. Reportedly, her father died on 12 Jul 2005 and her
older sister, aged 8, died on 14 Jul 2005. Further data on the suspected
source of their infection have not been provided; it would help if
information on possible contacts with the pig farms found infected in
Tangerang earlier in 2005 becomes available. The farms were in Babat
village, Legok subdistrict and Rancaiyuh village, Panongan subdistrict.
Contrary to the above news article, Indonesia's pig population is not
negligible, at least in relative terms. Here are some of FAO's data (2002)
on the pig populations in HPAI/H5N1-affected countries in the region:
Cambodia 2 105 400
Indonesia 6 000 000
Thailand 6 688 900
Viet Nam 23 169 500
China 464 695 000
The total population in Asia and the Pacific is 569 435 100 (2002); the
total world pig population is 941 021 700 (2002). It will be interesting to
note whether the current decision of the Indonesian government to
depopulate pig farms in Tangerang is based upon clinical observations
and/or laboratory investigations. - Mod.AS]
