State agriculture officials have warned states from Indiana to Georgia
about more than 100 pigs that have disappeared from a Carroll County farm
under quarantine. Maryland officials believe the pigs may be infected with
[trichinella], a harmful parasite.
The quarantine has been in effect since 1 Apr 2006, when an emaciated pig
infected with [trichinella] was found on the 112-acre Marston farm
belonging to Carroll L. Schisler Sr. and Carroll L. Schisler Jr. [We
normally do not make identifications, but as it may aid tracking down any
pigs, and a number of newspaper reports have already named these
individuals, they are included here. - Mod.MHJ]
"Testing of some of the swine on the farm (and escaped pigs captured just
outside the farm) were positive for several diseases of human health
importance," including trichinosis and toxoplasmosis, officials wrote in a
letter dated 29 Sep 2006 and addressed to state veterinarians.
"All the pigs on the farm (approximately 102) are now missing," officials
wrote. "We would appreciate it if you could make inquiries to livestock
market operators in your state to determine if they may have received a
consignment of pigs from Maryland sometime after 18 Sep." The letter was
sent to agriculture officials in Delaware, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky,
North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and
New Jersey. [States in general proximity to Maryland, but not up into New
England. - Mod.MHJ]
County, state and federal inspectors raided the farm in March and April and
found decomposing carcasses, piles of bones, livestock feeding on rotting
trash and the decaying bodies of other animals. Swine feeding on garbage or
carcasses would be prone to trichinosis, health inspectors said. The
Schislers were indicted in July 2006 on 19 criminal counts stemming from
the raids, including animal cruelty, feeding garbage to swine, and selling
contaminated meat on the property. State officials had planned on 14 Sep to
test 105 pigs on the farm but found the gates locked. They returned
Tuesday, but found only one pig. Officials were concerned that the pigs may
have been taken to slaughterhouses. The elder Schisler doesn't know what
happened to the animals, his attorney, Roland Walker, said.
A spokesman with the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said
Thursday that consumers shouldn't be worried about pork products on the
market, but should exercise basic sanitary practices, such as thoroughly
cooking raw meat. "Trichinosis is a very, very rare thing in America now,"
Steven Cohen, a spokesman with the federal agency, told The (Baltimore)
Sun. "I don't want to alarm people, but it is a good thing to remember (to
thoroughly cook meat) to eliminate foodborne pathogens."

[While generally US pork products are very safe, meat from these 100+ pigs
would not be. Quite the reverse. And previous reports on this incident
indicate that these pigs were being sold to minority markets.
As human disease has become rare, so has the ability of physicians to
recognise it. For those not sure how it would present, CDC lists the
following symptoms: Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, fever, and
abdominal discomfort are the first symptoms of trichinellosis: headaches,
fevers, chills, cough, eye swelling, aching joints and muscle pains, itchy
skin, diarrhea, or constipation follow the first symptoms. If the infection
is heavy, patients may experience difficulty coordinating movements, and
have heart and breathing problems. In severe cases, death can occur. For
mild to moderate infections, most symptoms subside within a few months.
Fatigue, weakness, and diarrhea may last for months. For more information
