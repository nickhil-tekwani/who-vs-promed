Excreted Tamiflu found in rivers
--------------------------------
Tamiflu [oseltamivir], the primary flu-fighting drug, is getting into
surface waters where ducks and other water birds may pick it up. If the
birds host influenza viruses, which many normally do, those viruses may
develop a resistance to the drug, scientists now worry. The premier
flu-fighting drug is contaminating rivers downstream of sewage-treatment
facilities, researchers in Japan confirm. The source: urinary excretion by
people taking oseltamivir phosphate, better known as Tamiflu.

Concerns are now building that birds, which are natural influenza carriers,
are being exposed to waterborne residues of Tamiflu's active form and might
develop and spread drug-resistant strains of seasonal and avian flu.

For their new study, Gopal Ghosh and his colleagues at Kyoto University
sampled water discharged from 3 local sewage treatment plants and water at
several points along 2 rivers into which the treated water flowed. Sampling
started early in December 2008, as the [seasonal] flu season got under way.
The researchers sampled again at the height of the seasonal flu's onslaught
in early February [2009] and again as infection rates waned. Tamiflu's
active form, oseltamivir carboxylate (OC), turned up in the treated sewage
on every occasion, the researchers report online on 28 Sep 2009 in
"Environmental Health Perspectives". Values were in the low nanograms per
litre [ng/l] range during the 1st and last samplings, and reached a high of
almost 300 ng/l at one outflow during the flu's peak, a week when there
were 1738 recorded flu cases in Kyoto.

River residues showed up during only that second sampling -- from low
nanogram levels at most sampling points to a high of 190 ng/l in a portion
of the Nishitakase River where treated sewage accounts for 90 per cent of
the flow.

Computer modeling has shown that OC should survive sewage treatment, notes
Wolf von Tumpling Jr of the Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research, a
Federal Institute in Magdeburg, Germany. Ghosh's team is now the 1st to
confirm this, he says. Von TÃ¼mpling's own data show that once exposed to
sunlight, OC will break down, albeit slowly. Concentrations would fall at
best by half every 3 weeks, he says.

If correlations predicted by earlier studies are correct, concentrations
measured at some river sites in the new Kyoto study seem "high enough to
lead to antiviral resistance in waterfowl," Ghosh says. And the Kyoto team
didn't test during a pandemic, when Tamiflu prescription rates might be 10
times higher, von Tumpling notes.

Indeed, the expected coincident hits by seasonal and H1N1 swine flu this
winter could send Tamiflu use skyrocketing. In a 14 Jul 2009 letter, Food
and Drug Administration deputy commissioner Joshua Sharfstein noted that
"there is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the emergency
use of certain oseltamivir phosphate products for the treatment and
prophylaxis of influenza."

Once ingested, virtually all Tamiflu will end up in the environment in the
active form, notes environmental chemist Jerker Fick of Umea University in
Sweden. The reason: Tamiflu becomes active once the body converts it into a
carboxylate form. Roughly 80 per cent of an ingested dose becomes this OC,
which the body eventually excretes. The body sheds the remaining 20 per
cent of Tamiflu in its original form, but this phosphate form is
immediately turned into the active, carboxylate form when it reaches a
water treatment plant, he says.

Two years ago, Fick's team published data showing that most
sewage-treatment technologies will remove "zero per cent" of any OC
present. And ducks love hanging out around warm, nutrient-rich outflows of
treated water during winter-flu season. While sampling for waterborne OC
last year [2008] in Japan, "I saw it myself," he says.

If Tamiflu resistance does develop in exposed birds, the affected flu
strains will probably be conventional seasonal and avian flu strains, which
claim thousands of lives each year, and not H1N1 [that is, pandemic (H1N1)
2009 virus]. That's because the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus seems to bypass
birds as it spreads among people, notes William Schaffner, chair of
preventive medicine at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in
Nashville, Tennessee.

He also notes that United States policy is more conservative than Japan's
when it comes to Tamiflu use. Federal guidelines, he says, recommend that
"Tamiflu be reserved for treatment of the very sick and anyone who is
immunocompromised."
