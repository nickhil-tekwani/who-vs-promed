Description of the situation
----------------------------
Since the outbreak declaration on 20 Sep 2022, a total of 141 confirmed cases and 55 confirmed deaths (case fatality rate [CFR] 39%) from Ebola disease caused by the Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV) have been reported by the Uganda Ministry of Health as of 21 Nov 2022. In addition, 22 probable cases (all are deaths) have been reported since the beginning of the outbreak. Overall, 19 cases with 7 deaths occurred among health care workers (HCWs).

The weekly number of confirmed cases reported has decreased for the 3rd consecutive week (Figure 1) after the peak observed in the week 17-23 Oct 2022. During the week commencing 7 Nov 2022, 5 confirmed and one probable case was reported, including one confirmed case and one probable death from a newly affected district (Jinja), in the Eastern Region of Uganda, which is 80 km (about 50 mi) distant from Kampala. The most recent confirmed case was reported by the Uganda MoH on 14 Nov 2022, from Kampala district.

A higher proportion of cases are male (57.5%), and the most affected age group is represented by those aged 20-29 years, followed by those aged 30-39 years (Figure 2). Around 25% of cases are reported among children under 10 years old, indicating potential household transmission.

Since the last Disease Outbreak News (DON) published on 10 Nov 2022, one newly affected district has been reported (Jinja), leading to a total of 9 districts that have reported confirmed SUVD cases. The most affected district remains Mubende with 64 (45%) confirmed cases and 29 (53%) confirmed deaths, followed by Kassanda with 48 (34%) confirmed cases and 20 (36%) confirmed deaths. Two districts, Bunyangabu and Kagadi, have not reported cases for more than 42 days.

Although there is significant improvement in surveillance activities in most affected districts, contact tracing gaps have been reported in newly affected districts. The suboptimal performance could be attributed to different factors, such as the non-reporting of probable cases, high population mobility including the movement of non-listed and/or missing contacts, and initial gaps in human and material resources. Surveillance strengthening plans have been put in place in newly affected districts.

Since the beginning of the outbreak, 4652 contacts have been registered, of which 3599 (78%) have completed the 21-day follow-up period.

As of 21 Nov 2022, a total of 700 contacts in 5 districts (Jinja, Kampala, Kassanda, Masaka, and Mubende) were under active surveillance. In the week commencing 14 Nov 2022, the average follow-up rate was 65%, representing a decrease of 26% in the follow-up rate as compared to 91% the previous week. Follow-up rates have been particularly low in Jinja and Masaka, at an average of 42% and 53%.

The daily number of alerts received has not been regularly reported to WHO since 7 Nov 2022, however, the number of alerts verified has been reported. During the week commencing 14 Nov 2022, at least 953 alerts were verified (daily average 159), of which 335 (35%) met the definition of a suspected case.

Public health response
----------------------
For further information on the public health response in Uganda by the Ministry of Health, WHO and partners, see the latest situation reports jointly published by the Ministry of Health and the WHO Regional Office for Africa: https://www.afro.who.int/countries/publications?country=879.

In addition to responding to this outbreak, the Ministry of Health and WHO are also responding to an ongoing outbreak of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in Uganda, supporting clinical management and facilitating a referral pathway for the effective isolation and treatment of suspected and confirmed cases of CCHF and SUDV disease.

Following a Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) Request for Assistance, as of 22 Nov 2022, there have been 52 offers of support received from 21 partner institutions. Six experts are currently deployed through GOARN in the functions of case management, partner coordination and infection prevention and control. Additional offers of support have been received for the functions of water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH), epidemiology and surveillance, and laboratory capacities. In addition to the GOARN Request for Assistance, partners continue to support the Ministry of Health-led response across multiple areas.

WHO held expert consultations to identify candidate therapeutics and vaccines for inclusion in trials throughout October and November 2022 and to draft clinical trial protocols for both vaccine and therapeutic candidates against Sudan ebolavirus. WHO also requested the existing COVID-19 Vaccine Prioritisation Working Group (WG) to extend its COVID-19 remit to rapidly evaluate the suitability of candidate SUDV vaccines for inclusion in the planned trial in Uganda using similar considerations on safety, potential efficacy and logistic issues relating to availability and implementation. The experts recommended that 3 candidate vaccines should be included in the planned ring vaccination trial: VSV-SUDV from Merck/IAVI, ChAd3-SUDV from the Sabin Institute, and biEBOV from Oxford University/Jenner Institute. The 1st doses of one of these vaccine candidates are expected to arrive in the country soon.

Preparedness and operational readiness in neighboring countries
---------------------------------------------------------------
WHO has revised the prioritization of the surrounding countries after conducting a risk assessment. In addition to the 6 surrounding countries that were assessed to be at risk, 5 additional countries are being included, namely, Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan and Djibouti. These countries have important population movements to and from Uganda. WHO has started to engage with these countries and will report their readiness activities in the next DON report.

The ministries of health of the 6 neighboring countries (Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, and Tanzania), in-country and international partners, and WHO are supporting SUDV readiness actions.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
On 4 Nov 2022, WHO revised the risk assessment for this event from high to very high at the national level, and from low to high at the regional level, while the risk remained low at the global level.

WHO advice
----------
Successful SUDV disease outbreak control relies on applying a package of interventions, including case management, community engagement, surveillance and contact tracing, strengthening laboratory capacity, safe and dignified burials.

Health care workers should always take standard precautions when caring for patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis. Implementation of IPC measures in health care (e.g., hand hygiene, training of health workers, adequate personal protective equipment [PPE] supplies, waste management, environmental cleaning, and disinfection, etc.) with ongoing monitoring and supervision for implementation is required to reduce risks of health care facilities amplifying the outbreak.

Ensuring the provision of safe and dignified burials, supporting IPC in community settings (including adequate WASH [water, sanitation and hygiene] facilities, hand hygiene capacity and safe waste management) and community engagement and social mobilization are essential to prevent and mitigate ongoing transmission.

Upon case identification, early initiation of supportive treatment has been shown to significantly improve survival.

Establishing active surveillance at points of entry is an essential component of the outbreak response to mitigate the risk of international spread due to the high cross-border mobility between Uganda and neighbouring countries.

There are no licensed vaccines for SUDV, but there are candidate vaccines which are due to be used in trials.

WHO advises against any restrictions on travel and/or trade to Uganda based on available information for the current outbreak.

[2] Sudan ebolavirus vaccine trials
Date: Wed 16 Nov 2022
Source: STAT News [edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2022/11/16/who-uganda-plan-to-test-three-candidate-ebola-vaccines-in-outbreak/


The World Health Organization and the government of Uganda plan to test 3 candidate Ebola vaccines in a clinical trial during the ongoing outbreak in the East African nation, director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced on Wednesday [16 Nov 2022], acting on the advice of experts convened by the global health agency. The first doses of vaccine should arrive in Uganda next week, Tedros said, though WHO has not yet indicated a start date for the trial.

The 2 Ebola vaccines that have already been licensed -- made by Merck and Janssen, the vaccine division of Johnson & Johnson -- protect against the Zaire species of ebolavirus and are not effective against the Sudan species circulating in this outbreak. A number of laboratories have designed Ebola Sudan vaccines over the past couple of decades, but this type of Ebola crops up rarely -- the last outbreak was in 2012 -- providing no chances until now to test vaccines.

The 3 experimental vaccines that will be tested build off of existing vaccine experience. One is being produced by the not-for-profit group IAVI and uses the same vaccine platform as Merck's Ebola Zaire vaccine, Ervebo; in fact, Merck made the doses that will be used in the clinical trial. It uses a livestock virus known as vesicular stomatitis virus that has been modified to carry a key protein from the Ebola Sudan virus.

The 2 other vaccines -- one is being developed by the Sabin Vaccine Institute, a nonprofit, while the other is being developed by the University of Oxford's Jenner Institute -- use adenoviruses that normally infect chimpanzees to introduce the immune system to a surface protein from Ebola Sudan viruses. The Jenner Institute used the same vaccine platform when it designed AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine.

Though the Ugandan outbreak appeared to be expanding rapidly a few weeks ago, the flow of new cases has slowed of late, creating questions about whether the outbreak could be brought under control before the clinical trial can generate answers. WHO officials acknowledged that is a possibility during a press conference Wednesday [16 Nov 2022], but said planning will proceed regardless. "What I don't want to be doing in 6 weeks or 8 weeks' time, is looking back if there's a deterioration of the situation and saying 'God, we should have. We could have. And if only we had,'" said Mike Ryan, head of WHO's Health Emergencies Program. "We don't want 'if onlys.'"

Ana Maria Henao-Restrepo, who co-leads the agency's effort to develop vaccines and drugs for epidemic and pandemic diseases, noted that the same concerns were raised in 2015 when the WHO, the government of Guinea, and Doctors Without Borders launched the Ebola Ça Suffit trial (French for Ebola, That's Enough) in Guinea to test the Merck Ebola vaccine in a clinical trial. That trial was the only one of 3 conducted during the 2014-2016 Ebola Zaire outbreak to have reached a conclusion.

"When we did Ça Suffit in Guinea, it was at the tail end of the epidemic and the same conversations were on the table. 'The epidemic is finishing. Should we do a trial? Is there enough time?'" Henao-Restrepo said. "Since for outbreaks nobody knows where they're going to move forward...it's better for us to work towards generating the evidence and put all our efforts on that."

The approach that will be used in Uganda is known as a ring trial and differs from standard randomized controlled trials where people are individually randomized to receive a vaccine or a placebo, and followed to see if the people in the vaccine group are less likely to develop the disease the product is meant to protect against. In a ring vaccination trial, the contacts of some cases are randomly assigned to be vaccinated immediately whereas the contacts of others get vaccinated after a delay. If fewer cases of disease develop among the contacts who were vaccinated without delay, the vaccine is deemed to have been protective.

Henao-Restrepo suggested that even if the outbreak ends before the clinical trial can prove whether the vaccines work -- or do not work -- there's value in the effort. "We are working towards the idea that perhaps even if we have a small number of rings, we could generate evidence that is important for this outbreak and beyond," she said.

An obvious example of this relates to the IAVI vaccine, which is the only one of the 3 not to have been tested in people up till now. The vaccine has been tested in animals, including non-human primates, the best animal model for Ebola.

It is not common to test a vaccine for efficacy before a Phase 1 trial proving safety has been conducted. But Henao-Restrepo said the trial protocol allows for the collection of safety data on the IAVI vaccine -- calling it "Phase 1 safety-like." "Whether or not the developers would like to conduct other studies elsewhere, that is their prerogative," she said. IAVI's CEO, Mark Feinberg, said the organization will conduct additional Phase 1 evaluation "as part of a broader integrated program to support regulatory evaluation and approval, if the vaccine is shown to be efficacious and safe."

In addition to use to control future outbreaks, any Ebola Sudan vaccine that proves to be safe and effective will likely end up in the US Strategic National Stockpile as a hedge against outbreaks -- either triggered by an imported case or a bioterror event -- in this country.

The WHO expert panel ranked the vaccines in order of which they thought were most likely to be successful, singling out the vaccine that is being developed by IAVI as the most likely to work. The vaccine being developed by the Sabin Institute -- which was designed at the National Institutes of Health's Vaccine Research Center and for a time part of vaccine giant GSK's development portfolio -- was listed as the second most likely to succeed. The experts ranked third the prospects of the vaccine being produced by the Oxford group, which actually targets both Ebola Zaire and Ebola Sudan. The experts noted this vaccine has not yet been tested in primates, only mice and guinea pigs.

Although the current Sudan virus outbreak in Uganda may be leveling off, it is urgent to proceed with the ring vaccination trials of these vaccine candidates, not only in order to have enough patients to be able to assess vaccine effectiveness, but also as a prelude to future expanded clinical trials in the event of another Sudan virus outbreak, and comparison with each other as well as historically successful Ebola Zaire vaccines. - Mod.LXL
