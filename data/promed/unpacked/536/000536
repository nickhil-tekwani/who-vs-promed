Staff of the Health Department distributed preventive medicines among residents of a tribal colony at Karassery grama panchayat in Kozhikode district on [Wed 22 May 2019] after lab results confirmed that the death of one of the residents there was due to scrub typhus, a disease caused by the bacterium _Orientia tsutsugamushi_.

According to sources, the patient, 65 [years of age], of Mayangal colony in the panchayat [village] had died on [4 May 2019] after undergoing treatment for fever for over a month. The lab results of his blood samples were made available on [Tue 21 May 2019]. Some of its symptoms are fever and chills, body pain and muscle pain, and headache. Persistence of such symptoms needed immediate medical attentions, doctors said.

People with severe illness may develop bleeding and organ failure, which may turn fatal, if left untreated. Doxycycline antibiotic is usually administered to scrub typhus patients.

Members of the Kozhikode district vector control unit inspected the colony, though it has been reported that the disease-carrying larval mites were yet to be spotted there. Awareness programmes were conducted in the area and the grama panchayat (village council) is planning to conduct fogging on [Thu 23 may 2019].

Health Department sources pointed out that a dozen confirmed cases of scrub typhus and 2 deaths had been reported in the district so far this month.

[Scrub typhus is a zoonotic illness caused by the rickettsia-like bacterium _Orientia tsutsugamushi_ that is transmitted by chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid mites, which feed on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents. After feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials.

Rodents (rats and mice) are common hosts for trombiculid mites and may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/9/12/03-0212_article). Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation.

Endemic regions for scrub typhus extend from Japan and eastern Russia southward to Australia and the Indian subcontinent, and westward to Pakistan and Afghanistan (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5687757/).

How the diagnosis of scrub typhus was made in this patient is not stated in the news report above. Scrub typhus presents clinically with chills, fever, headache, muscle pain, and sometimes with a macular or maculopapular rash and eschar at the site of the chigger bite; confirmation requires laboratory testing, usually by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, but this will require a 4-fold rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent specimens. Results from a single acute serum sample are unreliable, as it takes 7-10 days for IgG antibody to be detectable, and antibody will be present in a high percentage of healthy people in an endemic region. The Weil-Felix test, an agglutination test for the diagnosis of rickettsial disease, is based on the detection of antibodies to various _Proteus_ species, which contain antigens that cross-react with rickettsial antigens. The Weil-Felix test is unreliable but continues to be used in resource-poor regions (http://www.japi.org/august2006/O-619.pdf). Molecular methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are likely not available in endemic regions.

Kozhikode is a district of Kerala state, on the southwest coast of India on the Arabian Sea; the city of Kozhikode, also known as Calicut, is the district headquarters (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kozhikode_district). Karassery is a small village to the southeast of the city of Kozhikode (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karassery).
