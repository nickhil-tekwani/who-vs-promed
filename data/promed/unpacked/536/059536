The transfers of hundreds of Finnish tourists have begun from a hotel
in Phuket to other accommodation, following an outbreak of
Legionnaires' disease in the popular beach resort hotel.
Two Finns, a Norwegian, and 2 Swedish tourists have fallen ill with
pneumonia caused by _Legionella_ bacteria, after having stayed at the
Phuket Grand Tropicana Hotel in Patong Beach, Phuket. All had been at
the hotel in the period since 20 Nov 2006.
The National Public Health Institute has recommended the Finnish
travel operator Aurinkomatkat should transfer all its clients from
the hotel as soon as possible. The hotel must not be used until the
water and air-conditioning systems have been cleaned and appropriate
certifications on the completion of the measures have been received.
The National Public Health Institute is urging all persons who have
been resident in the hotel since 20 Nov 2006 and have fallen ill with
fever of more than 38 degrees C, either during the trip or within 14
days after leaving the hotel, to go to the doctor as soon as
possible. However, if the symptoms have already disappeared, there is
no need to seek medical care.
Pneumonia caused by the _Legionella_ bacterium can be fatal for the
elderly with heart and lung conditions, says epidemiologist Tran Minh
Nhu Nguyen from the National Public Health Institute.
The Grand Tropicana has a constant quota of 125 rooms for Finnish
travelers, and currently, more than 300 tourists are being
accommodated at the hotel, reports Tom Selanniemi of Aurinkomatkat.
Other accommodations have already been found for part of the guests,
even though it is not an easy task with the Chinese New Year being
celebrated soon.

Four cases of Legionnaires' disease have recently been reported in a
Norwegian, a Finn and 2 people from Sweden. These patients were all
among guests staying at a hotel in Patong Beach, Phuket, Thailand
since 20 Nov 2006. The patients became ill between 6-9 Dec and on 26
Dec 2006. Three cases are in men (aged 24-66) and one is in a woman
(aged 51). None of the cases has been fatal.
The responsible national institutes have informed tour operators with
whom patients traveled about the suspected link to the hotel. Some
tour operators have stopped using the hotel for their guests
temporarily, and all tour operators in Norway, Finland and Sweden who
used the hotel are informing all guests who stayed at the hotel since
20 Nov 2006 by e-mail or post.
Reporting of the individual cases to the European Working Group for
Legionella Infections (EWGLI) resulted in a cluster alert being
issued on the 3 Jan 2006 within the EWGLI network, and to the
International Federation of Tour Operators, World Health Organization
and European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC). Following
confirmation of the 4th case from Norway, an alert was issued to the
Early Warning and Response System on the 9 Jan 2007.
The WHO and ECDC are co-ordinating follow-up of recent visitors to
the hotel who may not have been contacted through tour operators.
Information about the cluster and advice to returning travelers has
been issued on the following national institute websites (National
Public Health Institute Finland: <http://www.ktl.fi>, Norwegian
Institute for Public Health: <http://www.fhi.no>, Swedish Institute
for Infectious Disease Control: <http://www.smittskyddsinstitutet.se>).
Legionnaires' disease (or legionellosis) is a bacterial infection
which presents usually as pneumonia, treatable with antibiotics.
Person to person transmission of the infection has never been
demonstrated. Incubation time is normally 2-10 days. Symptoms include
fever, chills, headache and muscle pain followed by a dry cough and
breathing difficulties associated with the pneumonia.
