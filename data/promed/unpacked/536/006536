State health officials report that a cow has died of anthrax at a ranch
near Wagon Mound. Five other cattle died at the same ranch in the past two
weeks, but anthrax was NOT immediately confirmed in the deaths. Several
people who came near the animal... including a bulldozer operator and some
ranch employees... are being treated with antibiotics in an effort to avoid
possible infection. But health officials state that they expect NO human
anthrax cases.
