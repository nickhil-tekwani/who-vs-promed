-----------------------------------------------------------------
The incidence of cryptosporidiosis in Scandinavia has increased dramatically in recent years. As shown in the graph [at the URL below], rates in Sweden per 100 000 population are approximately twice those reported in the United States -- and almost 4-fold those reported in the European Region as a whole [1-3].

[ProMED thanks Steve Berger for this comment. Outbreaks of _Cryptosporidium_ infections are well known in Sweden; see for instance Alsmark C et al. Two outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis associated with cattle spring pasture events. Vet Parasitol Reg Stud Reports. 2018; 14: 71-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31014741; and Ridderstedt F et al. Sick leave due to diarrhea caused by contamination of drinking water supply with _Cryptosporidium hominis_ in Sweden: a retrospective study. J Water Health. 2018; 16(5): 704-10); https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30285952

The European countries are working on establishing a common molecular typing of _Cryptosporidium_ spp. (Chalmers RM et al. _Cryptosporidium_ genotyping in Europe: The current status and processes for a harmonised multi-locus genotyping scheme. Exp Parasitol. 2018; 191: 25-30; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29908140).

This is an important tool in outbreak situations like this one.

With an outbreak with cases in several Swedish regions, the outbreak is more likely to be linked to food or drink than to drinking water. - Mod.EP
