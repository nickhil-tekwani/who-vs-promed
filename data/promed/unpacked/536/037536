Hand, foot & mouth disease cases at record high in Singapore
------------------------------------------------------------
The number of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) cases has reached another record high, with 1610 infections for the week ending 12 May 2012. The last weekly record was 1590 late last month. Cases fell to 1468 cases early this month. A Health Ministry spokesman said the current spate of cases are caused by a milder virus and not associated with the more serious EV71 [Human enterovirus 71], known to have potentially serious complications.

Philip Koh of Healthway Medical said the cases that have been seen at the group's clinics have mostly been mild and do not require hospitalisation. The medical board chairman added that infection rates should drop soon, as the school holidays are around the corner. A week ago, Minister of State for Health Amy Khor had said HFMD checks by health officials would include primary schools -- beyond the usual checks already being done at childcare centers, kindergartens and other tuition and enrichment centres.

HFMD is a viral disease whose symptoms include fever, sore throat, mouth ulcers, and rashes or small blisters on the palms of hands, foot soles and buttocks. There are currently 7 childcare centers and 5 kindergartens listed as active clusters with prolonged transmissions. Professor Quak Seng Hock, a senior consultant at the University Children's Medical Institute at National University Hospital, stressed the importance of personal hygiene. He said: "If your child is having fever and rashes on the palms, soles, mouth or peri-anal region suggestive of HFMD, see a doctor early and avoid sending your child to school."

A spokesman for a preschool in Simei said that 2 months ago, it had quarantined a child when he was found to have symptoms. "Parents can help by checking their children for symptoms before bringing them to school. Prevention is everyone's responsibility," the spokesman said.
