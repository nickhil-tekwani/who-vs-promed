Saratoga Springs, New York -- Non-U.S. [horse] racers must pass
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) tests before running at the Saratoga Race
Course. Prestigious European horses seeking Saratoga glory this summer will
first be quarantined at a USDA facility in Newburgh for 3 to 5 days under
new federal regulations designed to fight highly contagious and
economically devastating FMD. All imported horses are required to be
quarantined for testing.
FMD affects cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, deer, and other cloven-hoofed
animals. The disease spreads widely and rapidly, but neither humans nor
horses can get it. However, both can be carriers of FMD. Horses don't catch
it, but they can transmit it from their feet, saddle or farm equipment.
Everything from the horse's equipment to the footwear of personnel
accompanying the horse must be disinfected. Any excess feed, hay, straw or
manure that accompanies horses is burned.
Hill, a NYRA veterinarian for almost 20 years, said. "Who knows? People
coming from those areas might be a greater threat because they won't be
disinfected like the horses will."
