Tuberculosis Threatens Former Soviet Republics
---------------------------------
Tuberculosis, or TB, a pestilence thought by many to be a relic of a bygone
era, is once again a threat to public health, particularly in the former
Soviet Union, where experts fear it could overwhelm increasingly
overburdened health care systems. Just two decades ago, TB was another
disease that modern medicine believed it had conquered, but the United
Nations [UN reports that the "white pestilence", as TB is sometimes
called, is once again an epidemic -- especially in eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union. The UN's World Health Organization (WHO) says TB kills
2 million people every year. WHO says the epidemic is growing and becoming
more dangerous each year. In the 51 countries that make up WHO's European
Region -- which includes the Caucasus and Central Asia -- experts say TB is
spreading at an alarming rate. Eva Nathanson, a TB specialist at WHO's
Copenhagen office, says that most of the 370 000 new TB cases reported in
the European Region in 1999 occurred in central and eastern Europe and the
former Soviet republics.
In Russia the [incidence of tuberculosis was 82.5 new cases for every 100
000 people. In Ukraine the [rate was 61 per 100 000, Georgia reported 89.8
new cases per 100 000, and Azerbaijan reported 60.6 per 100 000. In
Kazakhstan, the figure for 1998 was 122 per 100 000. In Kyrgyzstan the
[rate was 126.9 per 100 000 and the rate in Turkmenistan was 88.9 per 100
000. There are exceptions. In Armenia, for example, the new case rate at
the end of 1998 was 37.9 per 100 000. [Nathanson attributed the latter to
an aggressive and effective TB control program run by the Health Ministry
and backed by the highest levels of government.
[By contrast, Britain, [with a population of 58.2 million, reported 5658
new cases of TB in 1998, [equivalent to an incidence of 9.7/100 000. In
Holland, where the population is 15.7 million, the rate was 7.7/100 000. In
the Czech Republic, where the population totals 10.2 million, the rate in
1998 -- the most recent year for published statistics -- was 17.2/100 000.
Without political will, TB control efforts are doomed to fail.
WHO cites other causes for the rise in TB cases in the former Soviet
republics and in eastern and central Europe. [It says poorly managed,
under-financed, and outdated control practices are common in most countries
with high rates of new TB cases. The agency also says that a lack of
anti-TB drugs plus the use of treatments not up to international standards
has led to rising levels of strains of TB that are resistant to drug
therapy. According to WHO, 50 per cent of the people who develop active TB
disease will die within five years if they are not treated. Another 25 per
cent will remain ill with chronic, infectious TB, and 25 per cent will
recover on their own.
