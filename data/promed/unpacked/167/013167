Tularaemia in Germany
---------------------

Several weeks ago Eurosurveillance Weekly reported an outbreak of
tularaemia in Kosovo (1). In Germany, although the disease is rare, it
should be included in the differential diagnosis of illnesses accompanied
by a fever and swollen lymph glands, as a recently reported case shows (2).

A married couple, both aged 61 years, presented to their general
practitioner (GP) on 5 Jan 2000 with a fever, bouts of shivering , and
other signs of a flu-like infection. The GP diagnosed influenza and treated
the patients accordingly. The symptoms did not disappear after a few days,
however; painful swelling of the lymph nodes in the jaw and neck region
developed. On 23 Feb 2000 the couple attended another GP for treatment.
Needle punctures and an incision of the swollen glands were performed as an
outpatient procedure. On 28 Feb 2000 they were both referred to the ENT
department of a university hospital, where tularaemia was diagnosed and
confirmed on 3 Mar 2000. Treatment with streptomycin and doxycycline from 5
Mar 2000 led to a complete disappearance of symptoms and eventual cure.

The probable source of infection was identified as the meat of an infected
hare which the couple had eaten in an upmarket restaurant in Berlin on 29
Dec 1999. The hare had been purchased from a wholesaler in North-Rhine
Westphalia, but the veterinary authorities could not trace the country of
origin.
