_Ralstonia solanacearum_ race 3 biovar 2 found in Mauritius
-----------------------------------------------------------
In Mauritius, 2 outbreaks of bacterial wilt (caused by _Ralstonia
solanacearum_ -- EPPO A2 List) were recently observed in seed potato fields
on different cultivars, at altitudes of about 90 m (295 ft) (one in October
2005 in the south, and the other in September 2006 in the north). In
Mauritius, although _R. solanacearum_ has been regularly found, all
isolates belonged to race 1 biovar 3. But in October 2005 and September
2006, _R. solanacearum_ race 3 biovar 2 was identified for the 1st time in
potato crops, as well as in weed species (_Solanum americanum_,
_Lycopersicon pimpinellifolium_, _Oxalis latifolia_). It is considered that
_R. solanacearum_ race 3 biovar 2 has recently been introduced onto the
island, most probably with latently infected seed potato tubers.

[Brown rot, also called bacterial wilt, of potato caused by _Ralstonia
solanacearum_ is widely distributed in warm temperate areas. Symptoms
include wilting of plants and brown internal staining of tubers, and plants
may die. Symptom expression is favoured by temperatures above 15 deg C (59
deg F). The bacteria may also latently infect tubers without causing
symptoms and can survive in seed tubers during storage to cause disease
when planted in the next season. The pathogen is spread by mechanical means
and insects, contaminated equipment, infected plant material (including
seed potatoes), and contaminated water (for example in waterlogged fields
or drainage channels). Solanaceous and other weeds and unharvested potato
plants may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Yield losses are mostly caused by
tuber rotting and, in many warmer areas of the world, brown rot is one of
the main limiting factors in potato production. The effect on food- and
seed-potato industries can be substantial, and tomato crops are also
susceptible.

_R. solanacearum_ invades the roots of diverse plant hosts from the soil
and aggressively colonises the xylem vessels causing lethal wilting
diseases. It was first reported as the cause of wilt diseases at the end of
the 19th century and is a widely distributed, economically important plant
pathogen. It has been classified into various races and biovars affecting
more than 200 plant species including major crops such as banana, peanut,
potato, tomato, and other solanaceous vegetables. Races 1 and 2 occur
worldwide in tropical climates, with race 2 causing the devastating Moko
disease of banana. Race 3 is present in a number of locations in the
Americas, Africa, and Australasia and is spreading in Europe. There are a
number of further races of lower economical significance.
