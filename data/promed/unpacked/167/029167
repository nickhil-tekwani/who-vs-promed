The Ministry of Health says that although cholera is now declared an epidemic in DRC [Democratic Republic of the Congo], Rwanda was not under threat and that imported cases were being contained. "As a result of this outbreak in DRC, the 1st case of cholera was diagnosed in Rwanda on 13 Feb 2012 from an individual returning from North Kivu," a statement from the ministry reads.

"Since then, 12 other cases were diagnosed and successfully treated and discharged from our health facilities a week ago. All registered cases were infected in the DRC but returned for treatment and have since been discharged with no deaths recorded," said the statement. The ministry also reported that no new cases have been reported since 22 Feb 2012.

Health minister, Dr Agnes Binagwaho, emphasised the need for hygiene, continuous sensitisation, as well as quick and accurate rapid treatment for the sick. "For now we have managed to contain this outbreak, but what I need to remind everyone is that this outbreak is a ticking bomb, especially within our neighbors and, therefore, if we are not prepared, it could spread to our population," she cautioned health officials during a meeting.

[2] Cholera - Nigeria (Kaduna, Gombe states)

The annual rampage of the cholera disease is now so predictable that millions of Nigerians rarely pay attention to it. Yet, its re-occurrence in areas most prone, have had devastating effects with death numbers steadily climbing. In the midst of this harvest of deaths, we also have oasis of hope, that is the near cholera free states. Why are some states cholera prone and some cholera free? Daily Trust Health Insight investigates.

The casualties started trickling in before the rains began in 2011. 5 deaths in Adamawa, 30 in hospital; 11 deaths in Nasarawa; another 11 deaths in Oyo. They spanned 203 local government areas across 26 states. With a fatality ratio estimated at 3.2 percent, the disease claimed 742 lives by the end of 2011. Epidemiologists in weekly updates overseen by the federal health ministry recorded a total 23, 377 cases.

The 1st 2 months in 2012, just 2 states have recorded cholera cases, the federal health ministry said in its weekly epidemiological update. The 1st 5 weeks saw 14 cases with no deaths in Kaduna and Gombe. A week later, the suspected cases jumped to 40; 1 death was reported.

Kaduna lay right at the heart of an official map showing the extent of outbreak last year [2011]. In 2012, Kaduna is still on the map, with 3 council areas, Kuban, Ikara, and Zaria, affected. Funakaye and Gombe in Gombe state are 2 other areas where cases have been recorded in 2012 also.

[3] Cholera - Republic of the Congo (Likouala province)

Health authorities in the Republic of the Congo have recorded 340 cases of cholera, 9 of them fatal, since June 2011, in the northern district of Likouala, and have warned that the disease continues to spread and that some health centers lack sufficient treatment.

"Some deaths have not been taken into account because the families have not reported them," said Jean Martin Mabiala, the doctor in charge of health services in the district, adding that there were other suspected cases that had not been confirmed because of the remoteness of their locations.

He said the crew of a river boat from the Central African Republic had buried 2 people suspected to have died of cholera in early February [2012]. The epidemic has struck a 500 km [300 mi]-radius area stretching from Betou to Liranga, which includes the department's main town, Impofondo.

"We have received some medical supplies from Brazzaville but the cholera patients use so much we have almost run out," said Mabiala. "There is a lot to be done to raise awareness and disinfect houses," he added.

[4] Cholera - Congo DR

A cholera epidemic has spread to 9 out of 11 provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the UN said on Tuesday [21 Feb 2012]. The UN said the spread was "worrisome" as the epidemic had so far killed 644 people and infected 26 000 since January 2011.

"Lack of access to potable water remains the single most important cause of the recurrent cholera outbreaks," according to a research note from the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA). OCHA cited the example of the north eastern city of Bunia, where over a third of the residents, more than 100 000 people, have been cut off from drinking water since the start of 2012. Conflict in the northern parts of the country continues to displace thousands of people.

[5] Cholera - Mozambique (Maputo province)
Date: Mon 20 Feb 2012

Inhaca Island located at 32 kilometres [20 mi] from the capital Maputo has been reporting increasing cases of cholera due to lack of safe water and the practice of non hygienic methods, the Maputo daily paper Noticias reports on Monday [20 Feb 2012].

According to local health units at least 20 cases of cholera are treated every month but they fear that the number of cases could be more than the figures indicated because many patients do not seek for medical assistance when they are sick due to the long distances they have to walk to find one.

The municipal district health director, Isac Piassone, said that the residents of the island do not have the habit of building conventional latrines and do everything outdoors. This is combined with the consumption of unsafe water and they have very little options because the piped water coverage is very poor though the island only takes 5000 inhabitants, Noticias says.

[6] Cholera - Uganda (Mbale district)
Date: Sun 19 Feb 2012

http://allafrica.com/stories/201202210103.html


Authorities in Mbale District have ordered the closure of all eating places that do not meet minimum health standards following a cholera outbreak that has left 2 people dead and left 14 others admitted to hospital. This outbreak comes at a time when the district is facing water shortage for close to a week now.

The district health officer, Dr John Baptist Waniaye told Sunday Monitor that about 14 people who had been admitted at Mbale Regional Hospital have been transferred to Busiu health centre IV cholera treatment centre and that the district health technical team has already issued warnings to people to stop buying prepared food and drinks sold along the streets in Mbale suburbs, in order to curb further spread of the disease.

Mr Patrick Namweru said it was clear from the beginning of 2011 that there would be an outbreak of cholera in town after Mbale Municipal Council authorities failed to collect garbage in town and NWSC [National Water and Sewerage Corporation] failed to repair the broken pipes in Mbale municipality. "We where just sitting on a time bomb. The municipal council failed on their responsibility of collecting garbage and the town was littered with human waste. It is sad and we must do something to save our people," said Mr Namweru.
