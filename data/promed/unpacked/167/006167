5 more suspected in Holy Family
-------------------------------
Another 5 patients suspected of having contracted Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) were brought to Holy Family Hospital (HFH)
in Rawalpindi on Thursday evening (7 Oct 2010). The suspected
patients include 2 women and 3 men.

Talking to the Express Tribune, Abdul Waheed, a staff member of the
hospital's isolation ward said these patients' blood samples will be
sent to the National Institute of Health (NIH) to be tested for CCHF
virus on Friday [8 Oct 2010]. He said 27 out of the 32 patients
admitted to the ward had tested positive for the virus.

He said that blood samples of the 3 female staff members of the
hospital who had earlier tested positive for CCHF, and were treated,
have been sent to the NIH again for verification [presumably to
ensure that they are now free of virus? - Mod.CP]. Their results are
due on Friday [8 Oct 2010], he added.

Dr Saima Naz, also a senior staff member of the hospital's isolation
ward said that 5 patients in the ward have tested positive of dengue
fever, while blood samples of the remaining 21 patients suspected of
dengue have been sent to NIH. The majority of these patients belong
to Chakwal and include 2 children, said Naz. She said strict measures
were being taken in all hospital wards to prevent the disease from spreading.

[Cases of CCHF in Punjab province continue to accumulate, but there
has been little information so far about the source (or sources) of
the outbreak. In total, 27 of the 32 CCHF cases have been confirmed
by laboratory tests, and 5 of 26 cases of suspected dengue fever have
been confirmed. It is unclear from this press report whether the CCHF
and dengue fever patients are housed in the same or different
isolation wards. Clarification would be appreciated.
