One more poultry sample in East China has tested positive for the deadly H7N9 strain of avian flu, the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) said on Monday [22 Apr 2013].

The avian flu virus was detected in one pigeon sample collected at a pigeon farm in Haian County of Jiangsu province, according to an MOA statement on its website.

After gene sequence analysis, the national avian flu reference laboratory concluded that the strain of H7N9 found in the sample was highly congeneric with that found in a pigeon sample on 4 Apr 2013.

In the original post (45) I inserted "[chicken]" in my comment in the 1st paragraph:

"...the OIE Follow-up report no. 4, 22 Apr 2013 (one outbreak): one [chicken] farm in Jiangsu."

This was not correct; although that OIE report referred to a farm with 340 "birds," all culled (and one positive pigeon), it was in fact a pigeon farm; see Source report above, which we had not seen previously -- the MOA website is in Chinese.

Note that the pigeon was not dead; it was not clear whether it was even sick, or why it was tested.

A Healthmap map of the location may be found at:

I regret the error.
