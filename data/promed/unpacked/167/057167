The information about avian influenza in the above posting was
derived from the BBC newswire at
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6272574.stm>, last updated: on Thu
5 Jul 2007, 09:04 GMT 10:04 UK.

The last avian influenza virus isolates in the Czech Republic, from
turkeys and chickens, date back to June and July 2007.

[The BBC newswire of 5 Jul 2007, erroneously posted as new, included
the following passage:

"Last month the virus was found on 2 poultry farms in the Czech
Republic. Outbreaks were reported last year in 13 European Union
countries, although none has yet resulted in human deaths".

Obviously, the "last month" outbreaks in the Czech Republic refers to
June 2007 and not Mar 2008; the "last year"'s situation in 13 EU
countries refers to 2006 and not to 2007. Any inconveniences caused
by the error are regretted. - Mod.AS]
