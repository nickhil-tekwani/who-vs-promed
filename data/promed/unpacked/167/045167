A step closer to finding cause of Great Potato Famine?
Applying modern DNA analysis to 150-year-old potato leaves, a professor at
North Carolina State University is moving science one step closer to
finding the cause of the Great Potato Famine that reshaped Ireland and
America.
The development of fungicides has helped control the blight, but scientists
still don't know from what part of the world the fungus originated and how
it got to Ireland. That's where Jean Ristaino, a plant pathologist at NCSU
since 1987, comes in. She has found the genetic source of the pathogen,
_Phytophthora infestans_, on a tiny section of DNA from the dried leaves of
blight-stricken potatoes preserved from the famine.
"We are the first group to successfully (replicate) plant pathogen DNA from
old historic samples," said Ristaino. "Now what I want to do is track where
it came from."
Her breakthrough could lead others to perform genetic analysis on preserved
samples of plant life to track down other crop killers.
Ristaino began her research about two years ago. Using a genetic screen she
developed, she extracted DNA fragments of the late blight pathogen and
replicated them. That allowed her to map a minute section of DNA.
Comparing the mapped sections to a present-day sample of late blight
confirmed the disease had killed them.
Her screening tool has been patented by NCSU. Ristaino hopes it will become
a diagnostic tool to identify the blight in seed potatoes before they are
planted. That could control the spread of the disease.
The next step is to identify the genes specific to the pathogen. Those
genes could help scientists trace the fungus' origin and migration. They
suspect it first surfaced in Mexico.

[The basis of this work was the development in 1997 by Ristaino and
colleagues of a PCR procedure which used a specific _Phytophthora
infestans_ primer (PINF) and an internal transcribed spacer (ITS5) to
amplify a product of about 600 base pairs from isolates of _P. infestans_
from potato and tomato. PCR also amplified a similar product from isolates
of _P. mirabilis_ and _P. cactorum_, neither of which infect potato
although _P. cactorum_ infects tomato. _P. infestans_ and _P. cactorum_
can be readily distinguished by digests of their restriction products. In
further work presented at the annual meeting of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science in Washington, DC (17-22 Feb 2000), lesions
induced by _P. infestans_ on dried potato and tomato leaves were sampled
from the Farlow Herbarium (Harvard University), the Royal Botanic Gardens
Mycological Herbarium (Kew, England) and the USDA National Fungus
Collections (Beltsville, MD). Using a new PCR primer (HERB1) in
combination with PINF, Ristaino and her colleague G. R. Parra amplified a
100 base pair fragment of rDNA from 20 of 66 herbarium samples tested to
date. _P. infestans_ DNA from an Irish specimen (1846) and from three
British specimens (1845, 1846, 1847) were amplified.
The interesting feature of this work is the possibility of tracing the
origin of the late blight fungus and the source of the inoculum that
infected potato in Europe and the United States in the 19th century.
