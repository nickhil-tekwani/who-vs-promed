Cleaner's supervisor isolated
-----------------------------
At least 9 people have been isolated or put under observation after
the deaths of 4 people from a mystery disease. On Monday [6 Oct
2008], health authorities finally traced the families of [patient A],
37, from Slovoville, who died on Sunday night at Charlotte Maxeke
Johannesburg Academic Hospital, and nursing sister [patient B], 34,
of Westonaria, who died on Saturday. [Patient A] was a cleaner and
[patient B] a nurse, and both had contact with the 1st victim. In a
dramatic development on Monday afternoon [patient A]'s supervisor
went to Chris Hani Baragwanath hospital and was put in an isolation ward.

Zanele Mngadi, spokesperson of the Department of Health, said the
woman checked herself in at the hospital yesterday after hearing
about [patient A]'s death. The woman told the hospital staff that she
had been feeling ill for a few days, had flu-like symptoms as well as
fever. "Her blood samples have been taken and we are waiting for the
results," Mngadi said. At the moment, the only people who have
access to her are medical staff in protective gear.

Morningside Medi-Clinic spokesperson Melinda Pelser said the disease
had been identified as a viral haemorrhagic fever, the exact strain
had not been identified as tests for Ebola, [Crimean-]Congo fever and
other likely possibilities had all returned [out] negative. "Congo
fever is most likely the suspect, and a viral haemorrhagic fever is
high on the list," said Dr. Lucille Blumberg, of the National
Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD). Blumberg said tests on
samples from victims were continuing, but the fact that the 1st
person to be infected came from Zambia meant that of all the
haemorrhagic fevers, [Crimean-]Congo was the most likely. The Congo
fever virus is carried by a species of tick and is found throughout
Southern Africa.

"They haven't had Ebola or Marberg outbreaks in Zambia, and you even
get Congo fever here in South Africa," explained Blumberg. She said
that so far there were no other known cases of the mystery illness in
Zambia. "What we are doing is following the trail of possible
exposure, looking for contacts that person had, trying to find the
pieces of the puzzle."

National Health Department spokesperson Fidel Hadebe said the
department could not confirm speculation linking the deaths to
haemorrhagic fevers. The NICD is conducting a battery of tests, some
of which could take days to complete. The priority, explained
Blumberg, was to isolate the patient. Samples might be sent to the US
for further tests.

Symptoms have included flu-like illness, fever, diarrhoea, rash and
bleeding. Health authorities urged people not to panic and warned
those who developed such symptoms who had been in Zambia, or had
contact with the deceased, to get help.

The 1st victim was tourism operator [patient C], 36, who was flown to
the Morningside clinic on 12 Sep 2008 from Zambia in a critical
condition after being ill for 3 weeks. She died 2 days later. On 27
Sep 2008, the paramedic who had flown with her from Zambia, [patient
D], 33, of Speciality Emergency Services in Lusaka, returned to South
Africa and was admitted to the Morningside clinic with similar
symptoms, said Morningside manager Jaco Erasmus. [Patient D] died on
2 Oct 2008. Dr. Nivesh Sewlal, who was treating [patient D] at the
Morningside clinic, said he had diarrhoea, high fever and a rash.
Blood samples were taken from [patient D] and [patient C], 36. "The
results have been negative for viral haemorrhagic fever. However,
they have died of what of what seems to be a viral illness," Sewlal said.

The NICD was alerted last Monday night and began investigating a
possible outbreak of West Nile haemorrhagic fever. By then, 2 people
who worked at the Morningside clinic had fallen ill -- but they ended
up in hospitals that did not know they had been in contact with
someone who had died from an unknown infectious disease. [Patient B]
fell ill on October 1 and was admitted to a general ward with 4 other
patients at Sir Albert Robinson Hospital on the West Rand. She had
not told the Sir Albert Robinson Hospital she was ill, but it was
only the following day before Morningside alerted the hospital to the
problem and [patient B] was put in isolation. She died on Saturday.
Sir Albert Robinson spokesperson Marion van der Walt said 8 people,
including staff who had contact with [patient B], were put in
isolation for observation. "We're confident that none of those
patients were affected," Van der Walt said.

By then, Morningside clinic was trying to trace all staff who had
contact with [patient C] or [patient D]. The clinic and Health
Department emphasised [patient A] had been ill for months before she
had ever been in contact with [patient C]. Pelser said there was "a
very low possibility", that her case was linked to the others.

Outbreak of an acute disease in South Africa, ex-Zambia
-------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of an, as yet, unknown disease has been identified in
South Africa. To date there have been 4 probable cases, all of whom
have died. The index case was a Zambian national, resident in Lusaka
who had close contact with horses and a history of possible tick
exposure. The subsequent 2 patients had close contact with the index
case patient in a healthcare setting: a paramedic involved in her
medical evacuation to South Africa and an intensive care nurse in
Johannesburg. These 2 patients became ill approximately 7 days after
exposure to the index case. Clinical and laboratory features common
to all 3 patients include a prodromal illness of approximately 7 days
with (38oC), a morbilliform rash in 2 patients, thrombocytopaenia and
mild hepatic dysfunction in 2 patients. An initial improvement was
reported in the 2 latter patients, and all 3 patients had a sudden
and marked deterioration in mental state, rhabdomyolysis in one case,
and evidence of acute and severe hepatic necrosis. Bleeding was not a
marked clinical feature although oozing from venepuncture sites was
noted as well as a petechial rash in one patient. Blood cultures to
date have been negative. Tests for viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHFs)
including Ebola, Marburg, Crimean-Congo haemorraghic fever (CCHF),
Hantaviruses, Rift Valley fever virus and Lassa fever virus, are
negative to date. No further secondary cases have been identified and
there is no indication of similar cases occurring in Zambia. It seems
likely that this is an isolated case with secondary transmission in
the nosocomial setting. Given the high mortality, nosocomial
transmission and clinical presentation, a viral haemorrrhagic fever
remains possible.

Laboratory testing for VHFs has been conducted by the Special
Pathogens Unit at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases
(NICD). Multiple nucleic acid and antigen detection assays as well as
serological tests have been negative for CCHF, Ebola, Marburg, Lassa
fever, Hantaviruses and Rift Valley fever virus. The final results
for viral culture in animal and cell cultures are pending. Only
specimens from Cases 2, 3 and 4 were available for testing. The index
case has been given a diagnosis of "tick-bite fever" and no specimens
were available for testing (she died shortly after arrival in SA).
Negative results to date may be explained by several factors. These
could include; the timing of collection (taken late - day 10 of
illness), virus variants not detected by current molecular and
serological assays. All contacts of cases, including healthcare
workers and laboratory staff are under surveillance and are all currently well.

[The 1st report tends to the view that that one or more of the 4
fatalities may be a consequence of infection by Crimean-Congo
haemorrhagic fever virus, although this preliminary diagnosis has not
been supported by laboratory tests. There are now 9 people under
observation, but not all may be suffering from the same illness. Also
it is not yet clear that the 4 fatalities have been caused by the
same agent. No more cases have been reported in Zambia.

The 2nd authoritative report from the South African National
Institute for Communicable Diseases reviews in detail the current
status of laboratory diagnosis, which has yet to confirm the identity
of the agent involved. It is concluded that Crimean-Congo
haemorrhagic fever virus, or another uncharacterised haemorrhagic
fever virus may be responsible. It seems likely that this incident
can be interpreted as is an isolated case with secondary transmission
in a nosocomial setting. Unfortunately no clinical sample from the
index case is available, which complicates the task of identifying
the causative agent.
