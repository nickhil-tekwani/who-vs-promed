Root vegetables could soon be more expensive and in short supply as
wet weather spread disease through crops. Cavity spot disease has hit
carrots and parsnips while onions suffered slow growth. The crops go
to food processors in Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, and Suffolk.

Wholesalers are preparing for shortages in the late autumn at harvest
time. Producer Simon Pearce from Setchey in Norfolk, said yields were
down as costs had risen, so everyone in the industry would lose
money. "About 15 percent of the crop is affected by disease as far as
we can see and this will mean shortages," he said.

"Also, everybody has to make a living and this includes producers and
retailers who have all experienced rises in wage and energy costs as
well. Anyone involved in producing, transporting, or distributing
these crops will have higher costs and someone will have to pay the
extra if the sector is to survive. It has to be said that this is a
tough industry at present and it is made worse when climatic
conditions go against us. There has to be some kind of inflation of
prices and many people are talking about a 20 percent price increase
this year [2007]," he said.

[Cavity spot is a disfiguring disease of carrots and related root
crops such as parsnips. Tonnage of the crop is not reduced but the
cavities make the roots unmarketable. Roots are rejected at grading
with one or 2 visible lesions, and when disease incidence passes a
relatively low threshold it becomes uneconomic to harvest crops. The
disease is caused by species of soil fungi belonging to the genus
_Pythium_. _P. violae_ is reported to be the primary cause of cavity
spot in European temperate areas. It is slow-growing and is favoured
by cool soil temperatures. It grows well in soil during the winter
months devastating early-sown crops. Disease outbreaks may also occur
later in the season after prolonged rain. Symptoms are elliptical to
irregularly shaped, depressed lesions, which tend to be more abundant
on the upper third of the root. They generally enlarge as roots
mature. _P. violae_ can also affect lucerne (alfalfa). Infections of
other hosts such as celery, black eye beans, wheat, cucumber, and
beets may not result in symptoms. The fungi can be dispersed by water
and mechanical means.

Hosts are generally more susceptible when the conditions are
unfavourable for plant growth. A diagnostic test for prediction of
likely risk of cavity spot in commercial fields has been developed in
the UK. Control measures include growing tolerant host varieties,
cultural practices, and crop rotation. Chemicals are used to control
the disease in some parts of the world, however this is not always reliable.

_Pythium_ species cause damping off and root rots in a range of host
plants, including onion. It is not clear, if this report suggests
that the problem on onions is due to another _Pythium_ species, or
whether the onion crops are held back due to other problems.
