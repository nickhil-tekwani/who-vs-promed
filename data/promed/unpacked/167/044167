The sickness plaguing a central Queensland fishery has spread to
prawns and other species. There is no end in sight to the crisis which
has decimated the fishing industry in the burgeoning port of
Gladstone. The State Government has yet to release the full results of
tests into a red parasite found in barramundi and sharks. Now
fishermen say the disease has spread to a range of fish as well as
prawns and turtles.

A tour of the harbour revealed prawns with pea-sized tumours and
deformed fish, a dead turtle as well as several other turtles
appearing sick and distressed.

While the Government has denied claims that dozens of turtles were
found dead near Curtis Island last weekend [12-13 Nov 2011],
commercial fishermen believe the harbour is sick and dying.

The commercial operators are negotiating compensation for the loss of
their fishing grounds as they are given over to dredging and
construction of the LNG plants that are being touted as a massive
boost for Queensland's economy.

They say they are not finding enough fish and other seafood of
sufficient quality to sell. Negotiations are dragging on and they fear
they may lose their industry altogether. The fishery reopened last
month [October 2011] after a government-ordered shutdown in September
2011, but continued catches of diseased fish resulted in Gladstone's
own fish market refusing to take stock.

State Government scientists say fewer fish are being found with red
lesions in the harbour, but parasite infestation of barramundi may
still be high. Fisheries Queensland habitat and assessment general
manager John Robertson said tests were continuing on fish inside and
outside the harbour and the banana prawn catch, which was thought to
be down 15 per cent.

Environment Department scientists maintain they can find no impact on
water quality that would cause fish health issues. "Certainly, we are
not seeing the number of lesions that we initially saw in August
[2011]," Dr Robertson said. "Things seem to have improved, but whether
we are getting less fish with parasites, we are still looking."
Fishermen rejected the findings yesterday [20 Nov 2011], saying there
was no evidence of a recovery in the harbour, which has had diseased
fish for 5 months. Queensland Seafood Industry Association chairman
Michael Gardner said fishers did not accept explanations about
diseased barramundi nor about how other species were impacted.
"Harbour water is absolutely filthy from dredging. Fishermen think
it's a cover-up," Dr Gardner said.

Fishermen believe the disease is likely related to a 46 million cubic
metre dredging program releasing heavy metals and/or acid sulphates
and high turbidity levels.

Dr Robertson said one theory was a major outbreak of the monogenean
parasite had occurred, as it had in the Hinchinbrook Channel a decade
ago, killing about 50 tons of sea cage barramundi.

Fisheries Minister Craig Wallace told Parliament the scientific focus
had shifted from barramundi to other species, particularly sharks. A
large parasite, different to the flukeworm affecting barramundi, was
found on several sharks showing red marks.

Sharks with the parasite also were found in the Fitzroy River near
Rockhampton and the Kolan River northwest of Bundaberg. Dr Gardner
dismissed claims the Gladstone Harbour fish catch was higher because
the latest data was missing the critical months from July to August
[2011]. Sunfish Queensland chairman John Crone said answers were
needed because port expansions were proposed along the coast. "Without
answers or mitigating strategies, the same could be repeated
statewide," he said.

[This problem began a few months ago with reports of sick fish that
had a parasitic infestation and red spot disease (Epizootic Ulcerative
Syndrome; see ProMED archive 20110925.2908). Red spot disease
outbreaks are associated with stress. This episode is associated with
environmental disruption (dredging work) and die-off of other
unrelated species, i.e. dugongs (mammals) and turtles (reptilians). It
seems that the problem is very complex. The whole ecosystem health
appears to be compromised. - Mod.PMB]
