Leptospirosis, a disease that has recently been reported in Oklahoma and Utah, can be spread from animals to humans, particularly if you own a pet dog.

Oklahoma veterinarian Sara Rowland recently treated a 7-month-old puppy showed signs of the disease, according to [KOCO-TV]. "The pet was not eating well, vomiting, and had a yellow tint that you could tell the liver was affected," said Rowland.

KUTV reported September 2019 at least 13 dogs in Utah had contracted the disease. Those cases are believed to have originated at a boarding kennel, where an infected dog may have been kept.

Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease affecting both animals and humans. Left untreated, the disease can lead to kidney damage, liver failure, meningitis, and death, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).

Leptospirosis is most commonly found in cattle and rats. According to the Royal Society of Preventing Accidents, it is one of the most widespread diseases humans can contract from animals, particularly through contact with water contaminated by rat urine.

Dogs often contract the disease while swimming in standing water or drinking from puddles, says the American Kennel Club. There is a vaccination against the disease available for dogs, but it is considered a non-essential vaccine unless the animal is at high risk for exposure.

While the disease is an occupational hazard for those who spend a lot of time with animals, such as farmers, leptospirosis has also been associated with contaminated bodies of water. British Olympic rower, Andy Holmes, died from Weil's disease, an advanced phase of leptospirosis in 2010.

["Dogs are most commonly affected. Leptospirosis in cats is rare and appears to be mild, although very little is known about the disease in this species. Common risk factors for leptospirosis in dogs residing in the United States include exposure to or drinking from rivers, lakes, or streams; roaming on rural properties (because of exposure to potentially infected wildlife, farm animals, or water sources); exposure to wild animal or farm animal species, even if in the backyard; and contact with rodents or other dogs.

Dogs can become infected and develop leptospirosis if their mucous membranes (or skin with any wound, such as a cut or scrape) come into contact with infected urine, urine-contaminated soil, water, food, or bedding; through a bite from an infected animal; by eating infected tissues or carcasses; and rarely, through breeding. It can also be passed through the placenta from the mother dog to the puppies.

The signs of leptospirosis in dogs vary. Some infected dogs do not show any signs of illness, some have a mild and transient illness and recover spontaneously, while others develop severe illness and death.

Signs of leptospirosis may include fever, shivering, muscle tenderness, reluctance to move, increased thirst, changes in the frequency or amount of urination, dehydration, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, lethargy, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes), or painful inflammation within the eyes. The disease can cause kidney failure with or without liver failure. Dogs may occasionally develop severe lung disease and have difficulty breathing. Leptospirosis can cause bleeding disorders, which can lead to blood-tinged vomit, urine, stool or saliva; nosebleeds; and pinpoint red spots (which may be visible on the gums and other mucous membranes or on light-colored skin). Affected dogs can also develop swollen legs (from fluid accumulation) or accumulate excess fluid in their chest or abdomen.

Leptospirosis may be suspected based on the exposure history and signs shown by the dog, but many of these signs can also be seen with other diseases. In addition to a physical examination, a veterinarian may recommend a number of other tests such as blood tests, urine tests, radiographs (x-rays), and an ultrasound examination.

Leptospirosis is generally treated with antibiotics and supportive care. When treated early and aggressively, the chances for recovery are good but there is still a risk of permanent residual kidney or liver damage.

Currently available vaccines effectively prevent leptospirosis and protect dogs for at least 12 months. Annual vaccination is recommended for at-risk dogs. Reducing your dog's exposure to possible sources of the _Leptospira_ bacteria can reduce its chances of infection."

In areas prone to flooding, hurricanes, etc., dogs taken to dog parks, swimming ponds, etc., or boarded, should have the vaccination included in the core vaccines. Furthermore, because it is a zoonotic disease, this vaccine helps protect you and your family. If your dog has been diagnosed, as having leptospirosis wear rubber gloves when cleaning up urine accidents. - Mod.TG
