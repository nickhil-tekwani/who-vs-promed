During the past several years, the staff of the
International Birding & Research Centre in Eilat
(IBRCE), Israel, has made a concerted effort to
collate, analyze and publish the bird-ringing
data collected in Eilat in order to understand
the ecology of migratory birds, with particular
reference to their geographic origins (6, 7, 8,
10-27). In light of the present pandemic
pandemonium, the aim of this paper is to combine
the information appearing in tens of articles
published to date by the IBRCE staff and students
on a wide range of ornithological subjects and to
present a coherent picture of the species known
to migrate to and from the regions affected by
H5N1 (12, 13, 16). I refer to the "affected
regions" as those discovered in 2005, because as
far as we know there is no direct migration
between Southeast Asia and the Levant. The
regions affected in 2005 are those bracketed
between Mongolia in the east and Croatia in the
west. The following are some facts derived from
the published papers and other on-going research:

1. Recoveries of birds ringed in other countries
are rare in the region owing to the small number
of banding sites in Asia in general and the
eastern Mediterranean basin in particular (8, 12,
13). Hence, use of ring recoveries alone can be
misleading. This was shown in orientation
experiments where, although 100 percent of all
Chiffchaffs (_Phylloscopus collybitta_)
controlled outside Israel were in western Europe,
87 percent of the individuals included in the
experiment at Eilat oriented northeast and
eastnortheast, suggesting breeding grounds in Asia (8).
2. Ring recoveries of Flamingoes (_Phoenicopterus
rubber_) in the 1970s (9, 11) were from Iran, but
in recent years all of the 1st-year birds that
winter in the saltpans of Eilat are from the
breeding colonies in Izmir, Turkey (RY, unpubl. data).
3. Raptors originate in the Black Sea region and
further east, including Levant Sparrowhawks
(_Accipiter brevipes_), Steppe Eagles (_Aquila
nipalensis_) and Steppe Buzzards (_Buteo buteo_),
(14, 15, 16), Booted Eagle (_Hieraaetus
pennatus_), Black Kite (_Milvus migrans_), Marsh
Harrier (_Circus aeruginosus_), and Eurasian
Sparrowhawk (_A. nisus_), (RY, unpubl. data).
4. Waders (Wood Sandpiper _Tringa glareola_;
Common Greenshank _T. nebularia_, Green Sandpiper
_T. ochropus_, Little Stint _Calidris minuta_)
ringed at Eilat are recovered in Eastern Europe
and in the Arctic (24, 26). White (_Ciconia
ciconia_) and Black (_C. nigra_) Storks, White
Pelican (_Pelicanus onocrotalus_) and Great
Cormorant (_Phalacrocorax carbo_) also migrate
from Central and Eastern Europe and western Asia
through the Levant in large numbers (5), some
even wintering in central and northern Israel.
5. Passerines that frequent aquatic habitats in
Eastern Europe and west of the Ural Mountains
also stop over or winter at Eilat: Reed Warbler
_Acrocephalus scirpaceus_, Sedge Warbler _A.
schoenobaenus_, Bluethroat _Luscinia svecica_,
Reed Bunting _Emberiza schoeniculus_, White
Wagtail _Motacilla alba_ (4, 6, 7, 17, 18).
6. Other Passerine species originate from areas
to the north and east of Israel, e.g. Red-backed
Shrike _Lanius collurio_, Masked Shrikes _Lanius
nubicus_, Ortolan Bunting _Emberiza hortulana_,
Crzetzschmar's Bunting _E. caesia_, Dead Sea
Sparrow _Passer moabiticus_ (10, 20, 21, 22,
25). Other species, although no bands have been
recovered, can be identified to the sub-specific
level and indicate their Far Eastern origins,
e.g., Stonechat _Saxicola torquata maura_ or _S.
t. variegate_, Isabelline Shrike _L. isabellinus isabellinus_.
7. Near-Passerines that breed in the Levant also
migrate through Eilat: European Bee-eater _Merops
apiaster_ (27), Quail _Coturnix coturnix_, and
Turtle Dove _Streptopelia turtur_ (RY, in prep).
8. There is always the possibility of a number of
new, vagrant and accidental species turning up at
Eilat from the infected regions to north and east of Israel (19, 23).
9. Placing all the "blame" on migratory species
could also be problematic in light of the fact
that even those that appear to be sedentary (eg.,
House Sparrow _Passer domesticus_, Bulbul
_Pycnonotus xanthopygus_) exhibit great coverage
of geographical areas during the dispersal period
immediately after their breeding season. Birds we
considered sedentary in Eilat, and ringed as
fledglings in the IBRCE Bird Sanctuary, have been
recovered as far to the east as the Jordan-Iraqi border.

As H5N1 has been shown to affect a range of avian
families and, as shown here, species of many bird
families traverse Israel during migration,
monitoring and sampling should be applied in
relation to birds originating from several
directions, and not be restricted to birds
assumed to originate from the breeding areas to
the north of the Levant. The present "trail" of
infections found from Kazakhstan and Russian
territories towards Turkey, Romania and Croatia
indeed follow the north-south migratory routes of
wild birds, but this in itself cannot be taken as
proof for migratory bird populations spreading
the virus. Since sick and dead birds cannot
migrate, it is possible that individuals in the
early stages of infection are those that are able
to migrate in the direction of their wintering
grounds and in this way a relay-style transfer
could be detected to spreading along the
migratory flyway. However, unlike other
infections (e.g. West Nile Virus), sampling of
migratory birds has failed to turn up significant
numbers of asymptomatic H5N1 carriers. Yet, an
OIE expert delegation to Russia has obtained from
the All-Russian Reference laboratory a list of
infected wild birds (waterfowl, waders, crows,
raptors, pigeons) sampled in several districts of
the Omsk Region (see annex 3 in Ref 1); similarly
to the EMPRES guidelines, the list includes also
species of Passerines and near-passerines. It
might be suggested that H5N1 is, most probably,
lethal to wild avian populations and --
similarly to our results for West Nile Virus --
infection is neither habitat- nor
taxonomic-related. We sampled 1703 birds from 59
species in autumn 2001 and spring 2002 at Eilat
and, although the overall average infection rate
was 8 percent, the highest levels were found in
species independent of habitat or taxonomy.
Highest levels of infection were in Eurasian
Sparrowhawk _A. nisus_ 33 percent (2 of 6), Water
Rail _Rallus aquaticus_ 33 percent (4 of 12),
Red-rumped Swallow _Hirundo daurica_ 28 percent
(5 of 18), Rufous Bush Robin _Cercotrichas
galactotes_ 25 percent, Wryneck _Jynx torquilla_
20 percent (2 of 10), (2 of 8), Bluethroat
_Luscinia svecica_ 18 percent (46 of 156), Dunlin
_C. alpina_14 percent (6 of 44), and Barred
Warbler _Sylvia nisoria_ 15 percent (6 of 41). I
cannot stress enough that, based on the paucity
of information of the biology of H5N1, our old
assumption that wild populations are not
susceptible to viral infections, particularly to
H5N1, is most probably wrong, and that this might
be true in relation to multiple avian
families. Hence, sampling restricted to habitat-
or taxon-specific parameters could result in a
biased understanding of the environmental processes.

The guidelines also restrict their sampling
mostly to waterfowl and a small number of aquatic
or pelagic species, as suggested by most of the
action plans (WHO, EMPRES, EU surveillance
guidelines, etc.). The impression from these
guidelines is that the major infection is in
waterfowl even though other families have also
been infected (1). The conclusion about duck,
geese, turkey and chicken is most probably
derived from, and influenced by, their being in
the domestic poultry industry. Also,
cross-border trade in poultry and wildlife can
contribute considerably to the spread of the
virus. Partial proof for this is the fact that
most of the infections initially detected in
Russia and Mongolia were along railway lines and
human settlements. Even though autumn migration
had not yet started and bird migrations were
still very restricted, dispersal of juveniles was
random, and no unidirectional mass movement has
developed in the direction of the wintering
grounds. Waterfowl are also at the top of the
list as game birds that are hunted extensively,
and that factor might bias our understanding of
the true nature of the spread of Avian Influenza.

Further sampling should not be restricted to
birds found dead or freshly hunted as suggested
by existing action plans, but instead be
performed on a daily basis, from a wide range of
species. It is important that professionals
undertake sampling to ensure adherence to the
strict protocols that govern the capture and
handling process and to ensure hygiene standards
that will preclude infection to the handlers. It
is also of great importance that sampling not be
restricted to a given region, e.g., northern
Israel, because many of the eastern species cross
Israel at more southern points. The lack of
Eilat band recoveries in the rest of Israel
indicates that there are different points of
entry of the migratory bird populations along the
length of the country (2, 3) and that not all the
migratory flyways which criss-cross the Middle
East have as yet been identified.

The greatest risk of human infection with avian
flu has, so far, been attributed to close contact
with infected birds -- particularly, with blood,
saliva or droppings. Hence, possible contact with
birds should also be avoided in zoos, educational
facilities that keep captive birds, and holdings
of backyard chickens, ducks and geese. The
latter, and certainly commercial poultry, should
be kept indoors and under strict supervision
until the migration season is over in early-December.

The exact role of migratory birds in the
international transfer of the virus is still to
be scientifically elucidated. It is not to our
advantage, nor to that of our environment of
which humans are a part, if extreme measures
(e.g., extermination of whole populations,
draining of wetlands, etc.) are advocated without
the welfare of wildlife being considered
appropriately. There must be inter-disciplinary
cooperation, which includes avian migration
researchers in addition to physicians and
veterinarians, in our communities such that not
only a human pandemic is prevented but also the
obliteration of our global biodiversity not
threatened by extreme measures by the human race.

[Dr Yosef's contribution is very welcome, in view
of the need for enhanced involvement of
ornithologists in the global effort to control
H5N1 and prevent its marching -- or rather
flying? -- invasive spread. The growing concern
about the possible role that migratory birds
might play in the dissemination of the virus is
underlined by the season: a combination of
southwards bird migration, targeting the
Near-East on the way to Africa -- where control
measures might encounter serious difficulties --
on the one hand; and the seasonal, winter's
upsurge of influenza (including avian influenza) incidence on the other hand.

A comprehensive review paper titled "Potential
risk of HPAI spreading through wild water bird
migration", including maps, has been prepared by
FAO's avian influenza task force (Rome and
Bangkok) and published in issue No 33 of
FAO-AIDE-NEWS update on the avian influenza
situation, as of 1 Sep 2005. See
