RUSSIA - The sale of Belgian pork is prohibited in Russia. Just as chicken
meat, it may be poisoned with highly toxic dioxin, Russia's chief
veterinarian Vyacheslav Avilov told Tass.
SOUTH KOREA - South Korea banned pork, chicken, eggs and related food
imports from Belgium after the European nation discovered the
cancer-causing chemical dioxin in animal feed.
"We have banned imports of pork, chicken, eggs and related food until we
are sure of food safety," South Korea's agriculture ministry said in a
statement.
It said South Korea so far had no record of chicken imports from Belgium,
but did import a substantial amount of pork from that country. It said the
ministry would return or dispose off imported Belgium pork after consulting
with the Belgian government.
South Korea has imported 3,370 tons of pork from Belgium since early this
year. The 2,429 tons out of the total imports were already distributed on
the local market and the remaining 941 tons were waiting for quarantine
checks.
The ministry asked a local firm, which was holding 50 tons of egg-based
food originating from Belgium after custom-clearing, not to use the products.

The National Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service has asked local
importers not to sell the pork on the domestic market, said Park
Jong-myung, director of toxicology and chemistry division.
CANADA - The ban placed on the importation of products from Belgium that
may contain poultry meat or eggs, and pork or product products by the
Canadian Food Inspection Agency Thursday was not expected to have much of
an impact on the country's pork program, according to an official with the
Canadian Pork Council today.
The ban follows an announcement by the Belgian government prohibiting the
sale of chicken, pork and eggs after laboratory tests confirmed a number of
poultry and hog operations had fed their animals dioxin-contaminated feed.
Martin Rice, executive director of the Pork Council said that while the
news has sent shivers through the industry globally the overall impact on
Canada's import and export program should be negligible at best.
"The CFIA placed the ban to provide Canadian consumers an assurance that
something has been done to stop it and even if it doesn't come in, there is
something in place to stop it."
SOUTH AFRICA - The South African Agriculture Department Friday announced a
ban on imports of poultry, pork, beef and dairy products from Belgium after
the products were this week found to have been contaminated.
Any of the products presently in containers in ships in South African
harbors would also be withheld, Gideon Bruckner, the Agriculture
Department' s director for food safety and veterinary public health said.
As a precautionary step consumers were advised not to buy any of these
products until further notice.
HONG KONG - Hong Kong asked food retailers and wholesalers in the territory
to withdraw pork and poultry products from 4 European countries because of
a dioxin poisoning scare.
A government statement said the move followed information that animal feeds
used in Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands might have been
contaminated by the cancer-causing chemical dioxin.
"The latest information indicates that feeds used on pigs may also have
been affected," a government spokesman said. "We, therefore, have to apply
similar measures to pork and their products from these countries, same as
what we have done to poultry, eggs and their products," he said.
ITALY - Italy confirmed it had extended a ban on Belgian poultry and eggs
to include imports of pork and pork products due to fears they may contain
the carcinogen dioxin.
"The Health Ministry has extended the measures taken on poultry and eggs
and has approved, as a precautionary measure, a ban on the import of live
pigs, pork and pork products from Belgium," the ministry said in a statement.
The ministry said it had also ordered the seizure of all pigs, pork and
pork products which had entered Italy since January 15. The meat would be
tested for dioxin, it added.

Singapore yesterday moved swiftly to suspend all imports of meat and egg
products from Europe in the wake of concern that these may have been
contaminated by a cancer-causing chemical, dioxin.
A Primary Production Department [PPD statement last night advised the
public not to buy or eat any meat or egg products from Europe for now. It
said this is a precautionary measure following reports that
dioxin-contaminated feed from Belgium may have been exported to other
European countries.
The move comes a day after PPD suspended imports of all meat and egg
products from Belgium. PPD has recalled all frozen pork, canned pork and
egg powder from Belgium which were imported from January this year. It
wants food manufacturers, food caterers and consumers with these products
to return them to suppliers. Last night, it decided to widen its measures
and stop all meat and egg products from Europe.
In the meantime, it will review European meat and egg products imported
from January. If any is suspected to have been contaminated, PPD will
recall it from the market.

As precautionary steps to safeguard public health, the Department of Health
(DH) of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region had asked the food
trade to withdraw from shelves poultry, egg, pork and their products from 4
countries in Europe to facilitate a review of the safety of these products.
A DH spokesman said the move followed the reveal of more information that
animal feeds used in Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands might
have been contaminated by toxic chemicals called dioxin.
At the moment the Department was working closely with representatives of
the Consulates of these countries to obtain assurance on which of these
products from their respective countries had not been affected or the
products from the affected farms had not been exported to Hong Kong.
Samples would also be collected for testing of dioxin.

The [Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare instructed port quarantine
stations nationwide to suspend imports of Belgian produce that contains egg
as an ingredient. The officials said the decision was in response to the
European Commission's move to contain a dioxin contamination crisis by
destroying all Belgian food products having more than 2 percent of egg in
their ingredients.
Belgian imports since Jan 15 through Tuesday that have egg as an ingredient
totaled 103 tons and comprised cookies, cakes, waffles, mayonnaise, ice
cream and pasta, officials said.
The ministry also instructed importers to refrain from submitting import
permits for the products that are causing concern until safety concerns are
lifted.
French eggs are suspected of being contaminated with dioxin because chicken
feed that used dioxin-contaminated oil was sold by the Belgian oil company.
Health ministry officials said they have asked the French government to
clarify which food products that have egg as an ingredient could be
contaminated.
"We do not believe the contamination could cause an immediate health scare
because the amount of egg used in products such as cookies is limited. So
we should not overreact," an official said.
Officials of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, meantime,
issued an alert to animal feed companies nationwide asking them to refrain
from using feed imported from Belgium, France and the Netherlands.
Forty-eight tons of Dutch feed have been imported since January. Ministry
officials said the feed has not been used and is in storage at a warehouse.
The feed will not go on sale until its safety is established, the officials
said.
Food products from Europe that could be contaminated have been removed from
department stores and supermarket shelves in Tokyo.

[Additional news reports, too numerous to include, were received today
extending the ban on Belgian poultry, beef, pork, and dairy products with
some country-to-country variations on the theme. Most Arab Middle Eastern
and North African countries are included in the list, as are Malaysia, and
Taiwan. - Mod.ES
