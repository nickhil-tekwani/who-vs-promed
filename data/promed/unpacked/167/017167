- Pernambuco state and Guillain Barre syndrome. 25 Nov 2015. 7 patients developed Guillain-Barre syndrome [GBS] post-Zika virus infections; Researchers indicate Zika virus infection as the causal factor.

[Guillain-Barre syndrome is a severe inflammatory neurological disorder that attacks the peripheral nerves and causes paralysis. This syndrome often occurs a few weeks after a viral infection, even a benign one. Usually, when the body is attacked by viruses or bacteria, lymphocytes are responsible for attacking the aggressors. But sometimes, in very rare cases, the action of these lymphocytes is misdirected after a viral infection or the immune system can over-react. The body's immune system begins to attack itself. The patient develops symptoms of muscle weakness, and difficulty swallowing and breathing. Muscle weakness can turn into quadriplegia. Guillain-Barre syndrome is characterized by tingling, prickling and muscle weakness, and ascending paralysis. It starts from the feet, then rises gradually; in most serious cases, it can cause respiratory paralysis with the need for respiratory support in patients. In a report of GBS associated with Zika virus infections in Bahia state, Mod RNA commented that GBS has been related to infections by Zika virus in French Polynesia as well as elsewhere to dengue and chikungunya viruse infections (citing references) (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150716.3513770). ProMED would be interested in learning about any post-Zika virus infection associated GBS cases in Colombia, where a Zika virus outbreak is occurring. - Mod.TY]

[As predicted by WHO and in previous ProMED posts, Zika virus continues to spread in the Americas, with no epidemiological barriers to stop it. The mosquito vector, _Aedes aegypti_, is abundant in the Americas, and is actively transmitting dengue and chikungunya viruses. One hopes that the ministries of health in the affected areas will be on the alert for GBS cases, and share that information. - Mod.TY]
