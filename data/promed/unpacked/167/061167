The Food and Veterinary Service inspectors have taken samples from a farm in Skaista Country where African swine fever [ASF] is suspected, LETA reports.

There are more than 200 pigs on the farm, which is located in the quarantine zone for African swine fever in Kraslava Region.

The Food and Veterinary Service was notified by the farm's owner that the pigs' condition was deteriorating and several pigs were dead. All the necessary safety measures have been enforced on the farm while the samples are analyzed at laboratories.

Last weekend, several new cases of ASF were confirmed on farms in Dagda Region, Kraslava Region, and Valka Region. All the infected pigs have been incinerated by today [4 Aug 2014].

African swine fever has been found in 45 wild boars and 46 domestic pigs so far.

Agriculture Minister Janis Duklavs will be visiting the ASF quarantine area together with the Food and Veterinary Service Director General Maris Balodis and State Police officials on 6 and 7 Aug 2014.

During the visit, the minister will inspect several farms subject to bio-security measures and the places where carcasses of wild boars and domestic pigs are incinerated.

Taking into consideration that the situation has been growing worse since ASF was confirmed in Latvia on 26 Jun 2014, slaughtering pigs on a massive scale began last week in the area where a state of emergency had been announced, in line with the government's strategy for battling the disease.

The total number of pigs on Latvian farms was 350 000 last year [2013], including about 40 000 pigs in Latgale province.

As reported, ASF was 1st confirmed in Latvia on 26 Jun 2014, in the carcasses of 3 dead wild boars found just a few meters from the Belarusian border. A week later, Saema declared a state of emergency from 2 Jul until 1 Oct [2014] in Ambeli County, Bikernieki County, Demene County, Dubna County, Laucesa County, Malinova County, Naujene County, Saliena County, Skrudaliena County, Tabore County, Vecsaliena County, Viski County of Daugavpils Region; Aglona Region, Kraslava Region, Dagda Region, Zilupe Region; Kaunata County, Makonkalns County, Pusa County of Rezekne Region; Brigi County, Isnauda County, Istra County, Nirza County, Nuksi County, Pilda County, Rundeni County of Ludza Region, and Cibla Region.

On 22 Jul 2014, Saema also declared a state of emergency in Rezekne, Ludza, Aloja, Mazsalaca, Rujiena, Naukseni, Valka, Burtnieki, Koceni, Beverina, Strenci, Priekuli, Rauna, Smiltene, Ape, Aluksne, Vilaka, Balvi, Rugaji, Baltinava, Karsava, Preili and Riebini regions.

One more case of African swine fever (ASF) has been detected in Lithuania.

The virus, which causes mass death rates in pigs, was found in a farmstead in the Utena district, the Ministry of Agriculture said on Wednesday [6 Aug 2014].

According to the Ministry, the farmer's pigs were treated with antibiotics but later died due to the disease. It has been confirmed the pigs suffered a case of African swine fever.

Currently, veterinary specialists are counting pigs and taking samples for laboratory tests within a radius of 3 and 10 km. Having received the results of the tests, farmers will be recommended to slaughter pigs.

African swine fever was detected on one of Lithuania's largest pig farms last month [July 2014], sparking mass death rates in pigs. A state of emergency was declared in large areas of the country to prevent the spread of the outbreak.

Polish and Baltic officials have also drawn up plans to combat the spread of the disease.

[Lithuania submitted its follow-up report No. 2 on ASF on Wed 6 Aug 2014. The report, reporting the case above on a farm in Tauragnu parish, UTENA, is described as follows ("Affected population"):

"A dead pig (a 5-month-old male showing clinical signs similar to African swine fever) was delivered on 5 Aug 2014 to the National Food and Veterinary Risk Assessment Institute (NFVRAI) from a backyard farm (with 2 pigs). The pig had started to be sick on 29 Jul 2014 and died late night on 4 Aug [2014]. The other pig (a 5-month-old female) was clinically healthy. The State Food and Veterinary Service was immediately informed about this case, and samples from the dead pig and blood samples from the clinically healthy pig were taken for PCR and ELISA. On 6 Aug 2014, the NFVRAI confirmed African swine fever using real-time PCR and found positive results to African swine fever antibodies using ELISA. The other pig (the 5-month-old female) tested negative by PCR and ELISA. The clinically healthy pig was killed and destroyed."

Two new cases of African swine fever (ASF) have been detected in wild boar in the Podlaskie region of eastern Poland, which borders Belarus.

The notified cases of ASF in wild boar, found on 29 Jul 2014 at different locations, were found in the already infected area under proper restrictions concerning African swine fever. This area has been established in accordance with the European Union legislation, Commission Implementing Decision 2014/178/EU.

Both boar were found dead. The source of the outbreak is still unknown.

New outbreaks of African swine fever (ASF) [have been] registered in the Kaluga and Tula regions of Russia, according to a report by Russian veterinary service Rosselkhoznadzor. Both regions are located in the southwest of the country.

According to the report, samples of pathological material selected from 6 dead pigs from one of the private farms in the Mosalskiy District, Kaluga region as well as 3 dead domestic pigs from Przemysl District, Kaluga region have identified ASF [genetic material].

The disease has never been reported in Przemysl District, said the report. At the same time, in the Tula region, the [genetic material] was found in samples of a material selected from the carcasses of 5 pigs illegally buried in Povalyaeva village of the Zaoksky district.

At the same time, leading German virologist Professor Thomas Mettenlayter, director of the Federal Research Institute for Animal Health, Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI) said the recent actions of the European Union in response to the outbreaks of ASF were effective, while the same can hardly be said about Russia.

He added that all outbreaks in the EU are still reported at the border with Russia and Belarus, so it is not fair to blame Poland or the Baltic countries in not responding correctly to the ASF threat.

EU Officials from the Baltic states and Poland have agreed on measures to combat the spread of the deadly African swine fever (ASF).

Swine fever was discovered on one of Lithuania's largest pig farms this month [August 2014], causing mass death rates in pigs. Fears that the disease could spread to other farms in the Baltics and Poland have been raised, reports The Baltic Times.

Now, a Baltic-Polish task force of food and veterinary service specialists from the 4 countries will be set up to combat the spread of the disease. Agriculture ministers of Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Poland agreed to the plans after a meeting.

Latvian Agriculture Minister Janis Duklavs said: "A common position is necessary in our talks with the European Commission for co-financing to help combat the spread of the disease as well as for compensation and other support mechanisms."

Close cooperation between the Baltics and Poland is needed also to implement prevention measures throughout the region and to make sure this is coordinated at a high level, the minister added.

African swine fever in Lithuania and Poland was discovered for the 1st time at the beginning of this year [2014]. The swine fever was 1st confirmed in Latvia on 26 Jun 2014.

A week later, Saema declared a state of emergency from 2 Jul until 1 Oct 2014 in dozens of counties in Latvia.

Lina Mur, Beatriz Martinez-Lopez, Solenne Costard, Ana de la Torre et al. Modular framework to assess the risk of African swine fever virus entry into the European Union. BMC Veterinary Research 2014, 10:145 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/10/145.

"Abstract
--------
- Background: The recent occurrence and spread of African swine fever (ASF) in Eastern Europe is perceived as a serious risk for the pig industry in the European Union (EU). In order to estimate the potential risk of ASF virus (ASFV) entering the EU, several pathways of introduction were previously assessed separately. The present work aimed to integrate 5 of these assessments (legal imports of pigs, legal imports of products, illegal imports of products, fomites associated with transport and wild boar movements) into a modular tool that facilitates the visualization and comprehension of the relative risk of ASFV introduction into the EU by each analyzed pathway.

- Results: The framework's results indicate that 48 percent of EU countries are at relatively high risk (risk score 4 or 5 out of 5) for ASFV entry for at least one analyzed pathway. Four of these countries obtained the maximum risk score for one pathway: Bulgaria for legally imported products during the high risk period (HRP); Finland for wild boar; Slovenia and Sweden for legally imported pigs during the HRP. Distribution of risk considerably differed from one pathway to another; for some pathways, the risk was concentrated in a few countries (e.g., transport fomites), whereas other pathways incurred a high risk for 4 or 5 countries (legal pigs, illegal imports, and wild boar).

- Conclusions: The modular framework, developed to estimate the risk of ASFV entry into the EU, is available in a public domain and is a transparent, easy-to-interpret tool that can be updated and adapted if required. The model's results determine the EU countries at higher risk for each ASFV introduction route and provide a useful basis to develop a global coordinated program to improve ASFV prevention in the EU."
