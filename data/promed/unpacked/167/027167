14 people have been infected with anthrax in Tangail Sadar upazila. Upazila Health and Family Planning Officer Dr. Putul Roy said the affected people were among those who slaughtered and processed the meat of an anthrax infected cow on 4 Apr 2013. Also, 6 people from the 11 families that took the meat have been infected.

"On 11 May 2013, one of affected took treatment from Tangail General Hospital. On 13 May 2013, our people went to the village for diagnosis and brought all the infected people to the Tangail General Hospital," Dr. Roy said. Civil surgeon Dr. Nazrul Islam said he had also visited the area. A 16-member team from Dhaka visited the area yesterday [16 May 2013].

District Live Stock officer (DLO) Dr. Habibur Rahman said 1468 animals had been vaccinated against the disease in the last 3 days.

[I suspect that the exposure date of 4 Apr 2013 is incorrect, as this would have given a human incubation period of some 4 weeks. This is not unknown with very low levels of exposure, but that would have predicated only one or 2 human cases, not 14 involved in the butchering and meat distribution and the 6 people who bought more than they paid for. A date of 4 May 2013 is more likely.

Personally I am impressed by the veterinary response in getting just under 1500 animals vaccinated in the past 3 days. These are not big herds but are small herds of 3-12 or so animals scattered on small individual holdings. Hopefully, it has been successful in preventing further livestock cases, and thus human cases. It will be interesting to hear whether the vaccinating teams came across reports, even carcasses, of other possible livestock cases as they progressed from farm to farm.
