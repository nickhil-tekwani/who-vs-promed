The Changing Incidence of Tick-borne Encephalitis In Europe
-----------------------------------------------------------
The recorded incidence of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in Europe and Russia
has changed over the past 2 decades, but the geographical pattern of change
is heterogeneous (1). The most dramatic changes of all were the sudden
increases in 1992-3 in Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Belarus, and also in
Estonia, Germany, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. TBE cases have increased
steadily since the mid-1970s in Russia, and since the mid-1980s in
Switzerland, Sweden, and Finland. Since 1997, the first cases have appeared
in Norway (2).
Along the southern edge of the virus's range, in Slovenia, Croatia, and
Hungary, incidence has fluctuated and shown no consistent trend apart from
signs of decreasing over the past 4-5 years. In Austria, the only country
with extensive systematic vaccination coverage, TBE incidence has decreased
progressively since the early 1980s.
To understand the causes we must take a pan-European view of changing
climate and other environmental factors, socio-political systems, and public
health services, and expect to identify combinations of biological and
non-biological factors specific to each country. Continental-scale
multi-temporal data on environmental conditions, remotely sensed from
meteorological satellites, have given us predictive risk maps and allowed
insight into the climatic determinants of the rates of contact between
humans and infected ticks (3). Most obviously, development and death rates
that determine the distribution and abundance of ticks are sensitive to
changes in climate, habitat structure, and availability of hosts,
particularly the larger species, commonly ungulates, upon which all 3 life
stages of vector ticks feed.
Climate is also critical in determining the seasonality of activity. Warmer
weather in spring and autumn may permit longer activity seasons for both
ticks and humans, likely to be most important in northern regions such as
Scandinavia, where prolonged low temperatures are limiting factors for tick
development and activity. This may have contributed to the spread of ticks
and TBE to new parts of Sweden (1) and the recent appearance of cases of TBE
in Norway.
The circulation of tick-borne pathogens themselves depends on more subtle
environmental variables. We now understand that the force of TBE virus
transmission, and therefore the infection prevalence in tick populations,
depends on the degree of seasonal overlap between larval and nymphal ticks
(4). For persistent cycles, the relatively few infected nymphs must transmit
the virus to the more numerous larvae as they feed together on rodents (5).
This is associated with particular seasonal profiles of ground temperature,
which explains the focal nature of TBE despite the wider distribution of
competent ticks species, principally _Ixodes ricinus_ and _I. persulcatus_.
In some parts of Europe, climate change may disrupt the delicate balance
between tick demographic patterns and the TBE virus transmission route,
especially where increasingly warm and dry summers impose high mortality on
ticks (6). This seems to account for the decline in TBE incidence along the
southern boundary in Slovenia, Croatia, and Hungary.
Superimposed on these biological phenomena are non-biological factors that
can vary much more suddenly and are therefore likely to result in dramatic
changes in disease incidence. Most striking is the coincidence of the abrupt
1992/93 increases in TBE with the end of the communist era in eastern
Europe. This was accompanied by altered patterns in human behaviour
involving agricultural practices and the greater use of tick-infested
habitats for work, food harvest, and leisure activities.
Further complicating factors are various public health activities, including
improved surveillance, diagnosis, vaccination, awareness, and avoidance. The
history of TBE incidence in Russia illustrates the interplay of
non-biological factors well (7). High recorded incidence in the 1950s and
1960s is ascribed to expanding industries (for example, timber) in the
forest zone, together with improved diagnostics. There followed a period of
aggressive control of ticks by DDT spraying, achieving progressive decrease
in incidence until the early 1970s. Vector control then ceased, and by 1990
TBE cases were back to their 1960s level. The final upsurge over the 1990s
occurred as a greater proportion of city dwellers were exposed to ticks in
their garden plots and dachas, and as laboratory diagnosis of TBE improved
further.
Biologically, tick-borne diseases are amongst the most complex of infectious
disease systems. The observed epidemiological heterogeneity, in both space
and time, should therefore come as no surprise. Many of the above factors
are not defined by national borders, and so there have been regional shifts
in the incidence of TBE within countries as well as differential changes
between countries. Analysis on different spatial scales, local, regional,
national, and continental, will help us to disentangle the environmental
from the sociological causes. Satellites offer us one vital truly
international tool to help achieve this by revealing changing environmental
conditions over the same spatial scales.
