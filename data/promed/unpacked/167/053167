Report from an on-site team in Gabon
------------------------------------
I would agree with submitted comments that say gorillas (western lowland
gorillas in this instance) are unlikely to have been infected with Ebola
virus by eating duikers or other antelopes.
We are working on-site with personnel from the Centre International de
Recherches Medicales de Franceville (CIRMF) and Ecosystemes Forestiers
d'Afrique Centrale (ECOFAC) to survey villagers about wildlife mortalities
and contacts, and to confirm the reports by locating the carcasses where
possible.
Currently, we have verbal reports from local people of 25 gorillas seen
dead at various forested sites. Additionally, local hunters and villagers
are reporting finding dead chimps, guenons, porcupines, pangolins,
black-backed duikers, genets, rodents, a "snake", and tortoises. This in
itself is a rare observation. Local villagers and hunters say that finding
so many dead animals in a short period is unusual. From our work in Central
African forests, we concur. One group of hunters said they watched a duiker
eating or licking a dead gorilla (In zoos, duikers are known to eat small
amounts of meat if available).
Teams sent in to corroborate stories have found the remains of one gorilla
group (2 large males, 2 females, and an infant) together. At another
location, a report led us to a carcass of a adult male gorilla and samples
were collected for laboratory confirmation. In a village near the border, 4
people came in contact with a dead gorilla and collected body parts for
consumption. One of these people has died and the 3 others are ill. I have
no information about the laboratory confirmation of [infection in these
people, but 2 are reportedly recovering and the fourth apparently remains
unwell. A domestic goat living with them died bleeding from the nose.
Postmortem samples were collected from this goat. All animal samples
collected to date have been submitted to our collaborators at the CIRMF, Gabon.
To the best of our knowledge, the 4 humans mentioned above are not linked
to any of the other human cases (which appear to have direct or indirect
contact paths leading back to the illness and death of one man in Gabon).
