As lumpy skin disease has rapidly spread among cattle in 8 states of India, over 67 000 cattle have died since July [2022]. The viral disease's outbreak has prompted a massive vaccination drive in the country.

Lumpy skin disease has now spread in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, and Jammu & Kashmir.

India has begun administering the "goat pox vaccine" to all cattle in the affected states. The vaccine is "100% effective" against the lumpy skin disease, the Centre [Government of India] said.

Over 1.5 crore [15 million] doses have been administered to cattle in the affected states.

Indigenous vaccine "Lumpi-ProVacInd" for the lumpy disease has also been developed in India. Currently, 2 companies are manufacturing the vaccine.

[The 8 named states are, probably, the ones in which the virus is reported as actively circulating at present. A longer list, including India's states affected since the start of the event, late 2019, is presented in the commentary of item 2. - Mod.AS]

Over the past 24 hours, several cases [of lumpy skin disease (LSD)] have been detected in the national capital, though no deaths have been reported so far from here.

More than 170 cases have been detected among cattle in the south and the southwest of the Indian capital, Delhi's Environment Minister Gopal Rai said on Saturday [10 Sep 2022] evening. "In the past few days, symptoms similar to infection of LSD virus have been found in cattle of Delhi," he told reporters.

According to Rai, the Delhi government is taking measures to control the spread of LSD. The animal husbandry department has set up mobile veterinary clinics, a special isolation ward, and a round-the-clock emergency helpline number to combat the spread of infection, he added.

On Saturday [10 Sep 2022], Rai chaired a meeting to review preparedness and implementation of measures to arrest the virus' spread. "So far, everything is under control. Two mobile veterinary clinics are being sent to affected areas. People can also contact on helpline numbers for treatment of infected cattle," said the official.

Eleven rapid response teams have been formed for the treatment of infected cattle, which will also collect samples, and 4 teams for raising awareness among farmers and cattle herders, he added.

Taking a serious note of the evolving situation, the Indian government has asked states to boost the vaccination process in a bid to control the spread of the viral disease.

The federal government has issued an advisory for cattle owners, listing 9 key measures to contain the LSD, including proper hygiene, not moving infected cattle outside, hand sanitization by caretakers, use of disinfectants to kill mosquitoes and flies, nutritious food to infected, isolated cattle, and burying the dead cattle with salt and lime.

People should contact the emergency helpline in case the cattle is ill, consult a vet, and not try to treat the cattle on their own, the advisory said.

A month ago, federal Minister for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Narendra Singh Tomar launched the indigenous vaccine Lumpi-ProVacInd to protect livestock animals from the LSD. The vaccine is developed by the National Research Center on Equines in the northern state of Haryana in collaboration with the Indian Veterinary Research Institute, based in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.

The outbreak of the LSD was first reported in India in 2019, after which research institutes in the country had been engaged in developing the vaccine.

[India is divided into 29 states and 7 union territories. According to earlier media-based information, since the introduction of LSD into north India, late 2019, the following Indian states have become published as infected: Odisha, Kerala, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Assam, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Uttarakhand, Haryana, as well as the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Andaman & Nicobar (islands). An official update is warranted.

According to FAO's 2020 publication "LSD qualitative risk assessment & management" (see citation below), the economic impact of LSD on South, East, and Southeast Asia's countries was estimated to be up to USD 1.45 billion in direct losses of livestock and production. The document discussed the trade implications for the infected countries. For India, a prominent exporter, globally, of live cattle, buffalo, and their meat/meat products, the losses could become of very high magnitude.

Reportedly, India initially banned the use of commercial, live-attenuated LSD-homologous vaccine (LSDV Neethling strain), which is available internationally (6 known producers), preferring the development of an indigenous homologous live vaccine. When the disease re-erupted in April 2022, more than 2 years after its initial introduction, spreading widely, it was decided to use the local goat pox vaccine (GTPV Uttarkashi strain) for emergency vaccination. According to the FAO risk assessment, in Bangladesh, the GTPV vaccine was used in Chattogram and found to be effective against LSD. The paper addresses LSD vaccines on pages 29-31.
