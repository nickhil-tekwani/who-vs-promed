What is killing Argentina's right whales?
-----------------------------------------
Fatal strandings of southern right whales around Argentina's Valdes
Peninsula have soared in recent years, and worried scientists are not sure
why, the International Whaling Commission [IWC] heard on Friday [25 Jun 2010].

From 1971, when systematic monitoring began, only a relative handful of
whale deaths were reported over the next 3 decades. Starting in 2003,
however, the mortality rate began to soar: from 31 that year, to 47 in
2005, 83 in 2007, 95 in 2008, and 79 last year [2009], the IWC's scientific
committee reported. "Over 90 per cent of the deaths have been of 1st-year
calves," the scientists said.

The Valdes Peninsula is one of the most popular whale-watching venues on
the planet, attracting some 200 000 ecotourists every year hoping to see
the huge mammals -- which grow up to 17 metres (56 feet) long -- in their
element. It is also a critically important breeding and nursery ground for
right whales.

Three causes, possibly in combination, have been fingered as possible
culprits. One is reduced availability of food for adult females, notably
small crustaceans called copepods and krill. Poor feeding conditions
lengthen the normally 3-to-5 year reproduction cycles, studies have shown.
High concentrations of biotoxins and the spread of an infectious disease
are also suspects. "The fact that the strandings are happening where they
do is not that surprising because it is a breeding ground," said Vincent
Ridoux, a marine biologist with the French delegation. "What we don't know
is why they are dying," he told AFP. If females are undernourished it would
severely impact calves, which normally consume about 125 litres [33
gallons] of milk every day.

Weakening might also explain "an extremely strange phenomenon": kelp gulls
that alight on the backs of young whales at the water's surface and feed on
their backs, creating lesions vulnerable to toxins or viruses. "We don't
know to what extent they contribute to mortality, but they are the only
visible sign of abnormality," Ridoux said, adding that he was unaware of
similar cases in other whale populations. As a precaution, the ICW has
asked local authorities to try to keep the gulls at bay.

NGOs and the government have also stepped up aerial surveys to hunt for
more clues as to what is killing the whales. Scientists estimated that
there were about 3200 mature female southern right whales in 2007, double
the number 10 years earlier. The population is not considered threatened,
according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

Created in 1946, the IWC is the only international body that oversees the
management of global whale populations. Its scientific committee is charged
with studying all of the environmental impacts affecting the animals
worldwide, including toxins, noise pollution, climate change, ocean
acidification, and ship strikes so-called "by-catch" -- where whales are
snared in fishing nets set for other prey -- are perhaps the most serious
short-term threat to the marine mammals besides large-scale whaling.

From 1994 to 2006, Japan and South Korea each caught more than 1000 minke
whales in their coastal waters this way, according to government statistics.

DNA analysis suggests that the real number of whales killed in the same
waters by by-catch is likely twice as high.

[While this article suggests possible reasons for the increasing number of
right whale deaths, I am hoping that there will be a laboratory report on
toxins, pathology, or other findings that will ultimately lead to an
answer. If more information is available, ProMED-mail would appreciate it
being shared.
