Anthrax kills livestock
-----------------------
A minor anthrax outbreak, which has killed 11 animals so far, struck
Jaligere village in Doddaballapur taluk. Livestock owners said the deadly
bacteria has killed the animals. Blood tests were done at the Doddaballapur
veterinary hospital and the results confirmed the presence of the disease.
Experts said that the disease might be due to bacterial growth in the area.

One of the precautions being taken in the village is to bury dead animals
deep inside the soil, covered with heaps of mud and limestone. Farmers have
been asked to contact veterinary officials if they found unnatural
livestock deaths.

Vaccination campaigns are being taken out in 4 taluks of Doddaballapur
district. Veterinary experts said the disease is deadly and farmers must
provide accurate and quick information to the experts.

[Unfortunately the _Bacillus anthracis_ spores survive best in alkaline
soils with high calcium levels. In the old days "quick" lime was used to
speed up decomposition but over time this shifted to the use of
agricultural lime, which was ok if the carcass had not been opened
facilitating sporulation -- during decomposition the carcass develops a low
pH and thus an environment inimicable to pathogen survival. The above
events may explain why the disease is persisting in Karnataka. It is best
to incinerate carcasses. In 2003 the state government initiated a
vaccination programme in Tumkur and Kolar districts, perceived to be "high
risk" districts. - Mod.MHJ
