Bird flu found at another Tennessee farm
----------------------------------------
Avian flu has been found at another poultry farm in Tennessee. It is a
low-pathogenic form, and the flu virus is the same as that found last week
[27 Apr 2009] at another farm in the state. Tennessee and federal
authorities are investigating a Lincoln County poultry farm after tests
found a strain of avian influenza virus, according to WATE [Channel 6 TV].

The Tennessee Agriculture Department said in a statement on 4 May 2009 that
the strain poses minimal risk to human health and is not the strain
associated with human and poultry outbreaks in other countries. Officials
said the strain can cause slight illness in poultry.

A preliminary test on 1 May 2009 indicated the possibility of avian flu on
the farm. Additional testing was completed by the US Department of
Agriculture. The farm provides breeding stock for poultry farms and none of
the poultry have entered the food supply. State officials told WATE this is
the same strain found on a poultry farm in Giles County last week [27 Apr
2009] but there is no apparent connection.

[How fascinating that the strain appears to be the same yet there seems to
be no connection. I wonder if there are personnel that are the same between
these 2 operations? Are there any birds that have been traded? Is there
access to any wild avians that could have passed the virus to these
facilities? - Mod.TG
