The sale of the nation's only licensed maker of anthrax and rabies vaccine
passed its final state hurdle, with approval of a deal to sell the
state-owned laboratory to a company led by a former chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff.
A state board voted unanimously Tuesday to allow the sale to newly formed
BioPort Inc., which has bid $25 million to buy the Michigan Biologic
Products Institute. Payment would be made in a combination of cash, secured
notes, product donations and royalties.
Among those attending the State Administrative Board's meeting was retired
Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in
the Reagan administration and director of Intervac L.L.C., a pharmaceutical
investment firm based in Maryland.
The company almost certainly stands to benefit from President Clinton's
expansion of the Pentagon's anthrax vaccination program to include all 2.4
million U.S. military personnel.
Once the sale is closed, BioPort plans to negotiate with the Pentagon to
make enough vaccine for the inoculations at an estimated cost of $130
million, including funds to renovate the aging lab.
"We've got a lot of hard work ahead of us," said Crowe. "The heart and soul
of this business is the U.S. government. That is our No. 1 priority."
Crowe, 73, was the U.S. ambassador to Britain from 1994 to 1997 and served
as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1985 to 1989.
The board approval was BioPort's last state hurdle. Michigan would be
responsible for any contamination found during its environmental study of
the 60-acre Lansing site. Once that process is finished, the sale contracts
could be completed. The lab has drawn international attention as the only
source of anthrax vaccine in the nation. It opened in 1926 and is the last
state-owned vaccine lab in the United States.
Gov. John Engler said he was pleased the aging lab that for years has been
losing millions of dollars would go into private hands, where it is
expected to prosper.
Crowe's Intervac is the major investor in BioPort, with 58 percent. Other
partners are Neogen Corp., a Lansing-based food safety research and
development company, with 10 percent ownership, and the lab's managers led
by Director Robert Myers, who have a 32 percent stake, according to BioPort
documents. The offer includes $3.25 million in cash at closing, $12.1
million in secured notes, $4.6 million in rabies vaccine and immune
globulin donations to the state and $5 million in royalties over five
years. BioPort plans to keep the lab in Lansing and its 170 employees.
