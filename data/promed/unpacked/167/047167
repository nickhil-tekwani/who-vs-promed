[China is the only surrounding country to report this disease recently,
according to the OIE Handistatus web tool. The United States Animal Health
Association's Gray Book on Foreign Animal Disease
<http://www.vet.uga.edu/vpp/gray_book/FAD/Search/search.htm> describes
sheep and goat pox as "an acute to chronic disease of sheep and goats
characterized by generalized pox lesions throughout the skin and mucous
membranes, a persistent fever, lymphadenitis, and often a focal viral
pneumonia, with lesions distributed uniformly throughout the lungs.
Subclinical cases may occur." Differential diagnoses include bluetongue,
PPR or Kata, contagious ecythema, photosensitisation, insect bites,
parasitic pneumonia, and mange. - Mod.PC]
