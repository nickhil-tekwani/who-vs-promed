The [New Zealand] Ministry of Health has released its new National Syphilis Action Plan in an important step in reversing a growing number of cases of the infection.

Cases of syphilis in New Zealand have been on the rise, following a similar trend in other countries.

In 2018, New Zealand had 543 cases of syphilis, 454 in males and 89 in females. That compares to 2017 with 480 cases, and 2016 with 322. 6 years ago there were just 82 reported cases of syphilis.

"We're very concerned at the growth in numbers, particularly around the rise of congenital syphilis, when infection is spread from mother to baby during pregnancy," says the Ministry's Deputy Director of Public Health, Dr Niki Stefanogiannis. "Congenital syphilis doesn't belong in New Zealand. The numbers are too high, and it's really important we do as much as we can now."

According to the action plan, the groups most affected by syphilis are men who have sex with men (approximately 70% of all cases); Asian and Maori men, and Maori women. "These figures show how important it is that we improve equities and access to healthcare for all New Zealanders."

Actions from the plan, developed in consultation with a working group made up of representatives working in the wider sexual health community, include:
- identifying a need to raise awareness on social media and through schools to promote condom use and regular sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing;
- improving available education on syphilis for health professionals, including lead maternity carers;
- preventing congenital syphilis -- including supporting the development of new maternal syphilis guidelines and developing new educational resources for midwives;
- Ministry of Health national social marketing campaigns to promote condom use and regular STI testing;
- the Ministry working with local communities to increase awareness of STIs among high-risk populations;
- the Ministry working with the Department of Corrections to include syphilis and other STI screening in prison health checks;
- production of a new podcast about syphilis and new material about screening and STIs for primary care;
- introducing a text based STI check reminder;
- providing screening in emergency departments.

"By increasing everyone's knowledge and awareness of syphilis and promoting condom use and STI testing, we will improve our prevention and ultimately turn these numbers around," says Dr Stefanogiannis. The action plan will be reviewed annually to ensure New Zealand's approach to managing the rise in syphilis cases remains up to date.

Ministry of Health. 2019. National Syphilis Action Plan: An action plan to stop the syphilis epidemic in New Zealand. Wellington: Ministry of Health.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Syphilis has been increasing in New Zealand every year since 2012. We are now also seeing cases of congenital syphilis in New Zealand -- a condition that was very rare previously. The Ministry has developed a national syphilis action plan (the action plan) to guide a systematic and coordinated health sector response to stop the increase in syphilis.

The action plan was developed in consultation with the wider sexual health community and takes a comprehensive approach to addressing the increase in syphilis, focussing on both prevention and treatment. 4 priority areas have been identified: prevention and health promotion; testing and management; antenatal care; surveillance and monitoring.

Each priority area has a number of actions to be delivered at either a national or regional level within a short-, medium- or long-term timeframe.

[The incidence of syphilis has been on the rise in New Zealand since 2012 (https://www.health.govt.nz/news-media/media-releases/rise-syphilis-cases-prompts-calls-practise-safe-sex). Provisional data from the Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR) Ltd, indicated that the number of syphilis cases reported in 2017 had more than doubled since 2015; the highest number of cases were reported in males aged 20-39 years, particularly those in the 25-29 age group, in the Auckland and Wellington regions; nearly 70 per cent of the cases were reported in men who have sex with men (MSM) and nearly 21 per cent of these cases were also HIV positive (http://outbreaknewstoday.com/new-zealand-reports-doubling-syphilis-cases-47556/).

This is similar to reports on the rising incidence of syphilis, mainly among men who have sex with men (MSM), in many countries. However, although MSM remain the group most affected by syphilis, ProMED-mail has reported that there has also been in recent years a rising incidence among women and men who have sex with women in many countries, with an increased risk of congenital syphilis if pregnant women are affected. This pattern has also been reported in New Zealand, where for women the highest number of cases reported in 2017 was in the 20-39 years age group (https://www.health.govt.nz/news-media/media-releases/rise-syphilis-cases-prompts-calls-practise-safe-sex). The New Zealand Ministry of Health above adds that Asian and Maori men, and Maori women are among the groups most affected by syphilis. - Mod.ML
