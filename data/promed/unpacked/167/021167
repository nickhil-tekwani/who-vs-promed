Banana diseases hit African crops
---------------------------------
Food supplies in several African countries are under threat because 2
diseases are attacking bananas. Crops are being damaged from Angola through
to Uganda -- including many areas where bananas are a staple food. Experts
are urging farmers to use pesticides or change to a resistant variety of
banana where possible.

Scientists have been meeting in Tanzania to decide how to tackle the
diseases. The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research
(CGIAR) issued a statement saying that "drastic and expensive control
measures" were needed. They recommended "completely excavating entire
banana fields and treating them with pesticides, or burning the plants."

Experts say the 2 diseases -- bunchy top viral disease and bacterial wilt
-- are both spread by insects and very few varieties of banana have
resistance to them. While bunchy top stunts the growth of plants, bacterial
wilt kills off plants and makes their fruit inedible. Christopher
Chemirehreh, of the Kawanda Agricultural Research Institute in Uganda said,
"It's a big danger because the affected areas have banana as their staple
crop."

[_Banana bunchy top virus_ (BBTV; genus _Babuvirus_) only affects _Musa_
species. It causes one of the most serious diseases of banana with symptoms
of chlorosis, stunting, and death of the host plant. Besides Africa, it is
also spreading in Australasia and the Pacific Islands. BBTV is transmitted
by the banana aphid (_Pentalonia nigronervosa_), and infectious insects may
be spread on plant material. The virus is also spread with infected suckers
but cannot be transmitted by mechanical means (for example cutting tools).
Disease management is difficult and may include vector control, removal of
inoculum, use of clean planting material, and frequent scouting for new
outbreaks. Eradication of established BBTV from a planting is usually
impossible. Tolerant varieties may still support virus replication and thus
serve as pathogen reservoirs.

_Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _musacearum_ is the causal organism of banana
bacterial wilt (BBW) in central Africa (bacterial wilts due to _Ralstonia_
species are present elsewhere). It affects all banana types causing wilting
and premature ripening of fruit. An incidence of 70-80 per cent in many
plantations and yield losses of up to 90 per cent have been reported. The
pathogen survives in soil and plant debris and is mainly spread via
infected planting material, by insects, mechanical means, and contaminated
tools. A range of alternate hosts may serve as pathogen reservoirs. An
integrated approach is needed for disease management, including cultural
methods like crop rotation, use of certified clean material for replanting,
as well as phytosanitation to reduce inoculum and prevent re-introduction
and plant-to-plant spread of the pathogen.

According to CGIAR, in Africa bunchy top is now present in Ethiopia,
Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, Tanzania, Gabon, DR Congo, Congo Republic, northern
Angola, and central Malawi; and xanthomonas bacterial wilt in Ethiopia,
Uganda, Rwanda, western Kenya, north western Tanzania, and North and South
Kivu in DR Congo.
