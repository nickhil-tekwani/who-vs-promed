Poultry Disease Detected in Gonzales County: Poses No Threat to Humans or Food
--------------------------------------------
Texas animal health officials on Fri 20 Feb 2004, received laboratory
confirmation that a flock of chickens in Gonzales County is positive for
avian influenza (AI), a contagious viral respiratory infection of poultry
and birds. The officials stress there is no danger to humans or food from
the strain of AI confirmed in the flock. The flock is quarantined, and
state and federal animal health regulatory personnel are working to contain
and eliminate the infection and determine how the disease may have been
introduced.
"AI, like many other viruses, can present itself in many forms, or strains.
The AI strain from the Gonzales County flock is H5N2. The signs of the
disease in chickens indicates this virus is a low-pathogenic strain,
meaning it poses no health threat to humans and causes relatively low
mortality in chickens. There is no danger in consuming eggs or poultry
meat, and that is the most important point," said Dr. Bob Hillman, Texas'
state veterinarian and executive director of the Texas Animal Health
Commission (TAHC). The TAHC is the state's regulatory agency for
livestock and poultry health. "Whenever AI is detected, we take action, in
order to stop the spread of disease, ensure the health of other flocks, and
protect our ability to trade poultry products with other countries without
any added flock health restrictions."
"The AI strain affecting the Gonzales County flock is not the same as the
highly-pathogenic (or deadly to birds) strain, which has spread this winter
to more than 10 Asian countries and sickened about 50 persons who live with
or handle live sick birds and poultry," said Dr. Hillman. "There are many,
many strains of AI, all of which have varying degrees of ability to cause
illness in birds. It is rare for any AI strain to cause illness in humans,
even to those persons who handle live, sick birds."
In recent weeks, 2 other strains of low pathogenic AI have been detected in
the United States; the H7N2 strain was found in 2 flocks in Delaware and 4
of the 35 live chicken markets in northern New Jersey. The low-pathogenic
H2N2 strain was detected in a Pennsylvania flock. In Delaware, more than
226 farms have been tested, with no additional infection detected.
"At present, there does not appear to be any connection between the cases
on the East Coast and the infected flock in Texas," said Dr.
Hillman. "Currently, we have a team from the TAHC and the U.S. Department
of Agriculture (USDA) conducting disease investigations and tests to
determine whether other Texas flocks in the area may have been affected,
and to find the source of the disease in the infected flock." He explained
that the on-site team has several regulatory veterinarians and about a
dozen animal health inspectors from the TAHC and Texas' office of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture
"Good biosecurity practices serve as a barrier against the spread of
disease. We are urging poultry and bird owners to ensure they take
precautions to prevent the accidental introduction of AI onto a
premises. AI virus can be killed easily with a commercial disinfectant or
with a solution of 3 parts bleach and 2 parts water," Dr. Hillman
urged. "Typically, AI is transmitted from a sick chicken or bird to a
healthy one by respiratory discharge. However, the virus can be passed in
bird manure, which can be picked up on boots, shoes, equipment, or tires.
To avoid the possibility of tracking in' viruses to your farm, keep a pair
of boots or shoes to wear only on your own premises, or disinfect your
footwear before entering the farm."
Boots should be scrubbed with a long-handled brush to scrape off manure,
mud, or debris, and the bleach or disinfectant will kill viruses, bacteria,
and parasites "Tires and equipment should also be disinfected before
entering a farm where birds or poultry are housed," he pointed out. "This
is particularly important if items have been on or used at another farm
where poultry are kept."
"Poultry owners should expect their visitors to follow biosecurity rules,
too," said Dr. Hillman. "Insist that visitors disinfect their footwear ­-
or better yet, provide them with disposable shoe covers, or footwear worn
only on your place. If visitors don't want their vehicle tires sprayed
with disinfectant, ask them to park outside your gate, or outside the
perimeter of the farm.. Right now, because we know there is an infected
flock in Texas, we need to work cooperatively to prevent the potential
spread of disease."

[The affected flock was composed of approximately 7000 birds. James Grimm,
executive vice president of the Texas Poultry Federation, a trade group,
said he has been following the case since the poultry farmer sent tissue
samples to the state lab on Tuesday for testing. The state has quarantined
the farm, and the birds will be killed this weekend and probably buried on
the farm. The farm raises poultry for live markets in Houston, TX. According
to Grimm, it is possible the birds picked up the infection at the market.
Grimm said that ducks sold at the markets commonly have avian flu. - Mod.TG]
