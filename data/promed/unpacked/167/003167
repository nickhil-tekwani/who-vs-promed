Chocolate maker Cadbury today, 24 Jun 2006, insisted there was no
link between a food poisoning outbreak and the mass contamination of
their products with the same bacteria. Senior executives said their
bars were "perfectly safe" despite recalling more than a million from
store shelves.
But the British Health Protection Agency would not rule out a link
between the recall and a quadrupling of cases of the rare Montevideo
salmonella strain over the last 4 months. An HPA spokeswoman said
that if the number now dropped off, it would strongly indicate that
the confectionery was to blame.
Cadbury came under fire from the Food Standards Agency over its
failure to report the finding of salmonella when it was discovered 5
months ago. A spokesman said the agency would have expected to be
told about the problem straight away, stressing that it did pose a
"real food risk."
Meanwhile, MPs demanded an explanation about why it had taken so long
for Cadbury to bring the issue to light.
The firm announced the recall yesterday, 23 Jun 2006, caused by the
contamination from a leaking pipe at one of its main factories in
Marlbrook, Herefordshire.
Seven of its most popular brands were affected, and the public was
warned not to eat any products they may have already bought.
Matthew Shattock, the company's European president, told BBC Radio
4's Today program that the levels found at the Herefordshire plant
were well below those at which it would normally issue a safety
alert. He said out of 7000 samples taken, just 14 were found to have
minute traces, with the highest level 1/30th of the normal level for
an alert. Since then, testing had been stepped up, and in a further
17 000 samples, not a single trace of salmonella had been found, he added.
A spokeswoman for the HPA said there had been 45 cases of the
salmonella "rare strain" Montevideo over the last 4 months, compared
with just 12 over the same period in 2005, including a significant
rise among children.
There was no evidence this was linked to the Cadbury contamination,
she said. But she added: "If the number of cases reported to us does
decline, it will be stronger evidence of a link with confectionery products."
A spokesman for the FSA insisted the salmonella found in chocolate
did pose a "real food risk." He added: "We were told on Monday [19
Jun 2006] that there was a problem occurring in January 2006, and
that problem has gone on for a number of weeks before being
corrected. We would have expected them to tell us. As far as
ready-to-eat foods [such as chocolate bars], salmonella contamination
is not acceptable, and that is why we would have expected to be told
in January 2006."

Cadbury salmonella scare probed
------------------
An investigation is under way after Cadbury withdrew a million
chocolate bars which may have been contaminated with a rare strain of
salmonella.
The company says the recall - while the Food Standards Agency and the
Health Protection Agency investigate - is precautionary and that the
risk is low.
But a bacteriologist says there is no safe level for salmonella in chocolate.
The possible contamination has been traced to a leaking pipe at a
Cadbury's plant in Herefordshire in January [2006].
Samples were sent to an independent laboratory after the leak was
discovered at the Marlbrook plant, and the montevideo strain of
salmonella was identified.
Government watchdog the Health Protection Agency (HPA) confirmed the
strain and, a week ago, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) was alerted.
On Monday, Cadbury officially informed the FSA of the possible
contamination of the 7 products.
The 250g Dairy Milk Turkish, Dairy Milk Caramel and Dairy Milk Mint
bars, the Dairy Milk 8 chunk and the 1kg Dairy Milk bar are among
products affected.
The 105g Dairy Milk Buttons Easter Egg and the Freddo bar were also affected.
'Precautionary measure'
Cadbury's European president Matthew Shattock told BBC Radio 4's
Today programme the recall decision was made after the FSA revealed
there had been an increase in the number of salmonella cases this year.
"We decided to conduct a precautionary recall to reassure our
consumers and the public at large to minimise any confusion as to the
quality of our products," he said.
Salmonella is a common cause of food poisoning but the montevideo
strain is very rare.
There have been 45 cases in the UK in the last 4 months, compared
with just 12 in the same period last year.
But a Health Protection Agency spokeswoman stressed that at the
moment there was no evidence for a link between the increase in cases
and the Cadbury recall.

Mr Shattock said the firm was "absolutely satisfied" its products
were safe to eat.
"We identified a problem early. We corrected it and fixed it," he said.
Cadbury said the levels of contamination were "significantly below
the standard that would be any health problem".
It said people who had eaten one of the affected bars should not be
worried about the risks but could contact the company for a refund.
However, bacteriologist Professor Hugh Pennington of Aberdeen
University told BBC News that the only safe level of salmonella in
chocolate was "zero".
"The fat in chocolate actually preserves the salmonella from the
normal intestinal defences, so you don't have to eat very many
salmonellas to get infected.
"It's about a thousand times less than if you're eating it from
traditional sources like meats," he said.
The factory at Marlbrook generates 97 000 tonnes of milk chocolate
crumb every year.
It processes 180 million litres of fresh milk, 56 000 tonnes of sugar
and 13 000 tonnes of cocoa liquor annually in the production process.
The crumb is transported to other sites at Bournville, near
Birmingham, and Somerdale, near Bristol, to be blended with cocoa
butter and turned into milk chocolate.
A Cadbury spokesman said the company had been manufacturing chocolate
for more than 100 years and always treated public wellbeing as its
"highest priority".
The free helpline number for Cadbury is 0800 818181.
Uneaten products should be returned to Cadbury Recall, Freepost
MID20061, Birmingham B3O 2QZ, and a refund will be given.

More than a million Cadbury chocolate bars are to be removed from
shelves amid fears that they may be contaminated with salmonella.
The 250g Dairy Milk Turkish, Dairy Milk Caramel and Dairy Milk Mint
bars, the Dairy Milk 8 chunk and the 1kg Dairy Milk bar are among
products affected. The 105g Dairy Milk Buttons Easter Egg and the
Freddo bar were also affected.
The contamination was caused by a leaking pipe at Cadbury's Marlbrook
plant, near Leominster, Herefordshire.
A Cadbury spokesman said the move had been carried out "purely as a
precautionary measure. The levels are significantly below the
standard that would be any health problem, but we are taking this
measure as a precaution. If there are people who have eaten one of
these chocolate bars today, they should not worry, but they can get
in touch with us, if they are concerned, for a full refund."
Affected Chocolate Products:
Dairy Milk Turkish 250g
Dairy Milk Caramel
Dairy Milk Mint bars
Dairy Milk 8 chunk
Dairy Milk 1kg bar
Dairy Milk Buttons Easter Egg 105g

[The relatively unusual _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Montevideo has
been described in a variety of settings, including human infections
from Easter chicks and lizards as well as a neonatal nursery outbreak
in Germany. That the numbers of recognized cases of this serotype
have increased in 2006, and that the serotype was found in the
chocolate, are suggestive, but not necessarily proof, of a link
between the chocolate and the cases. Analysis of the bacteria from
the chocolate (if available) and the human cases is needed.
Additionally, interviews of the affected individuals are needed to
assess whether the chocolate was eaten.
The initial report of the chocolate recall was not posted on 23 Jun
2006, as ProMED does not usually post recalls unless there are human
cases. - Mod.LL]
