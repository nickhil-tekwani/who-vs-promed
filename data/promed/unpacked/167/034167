[In the 3-day period 17-19 Jun 2014, there have been a total of 2 new laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection and 1 death reported by the MOH of Saudi Arabia -- continuing the trend for decreasing incidence of MERS-CoV infections confirmed in Saudi Arabia. In addition, there were reports of 7 individuals listed as "recovered" -- presumably in good health and no longer MERS-CoV positive through laboratory testing performed in Saudi Arabia. One interesting observation is that all of the recovered cases had no stated history of co-morbidities, whereas the newly reported cases and the one fatality reported all had a history of pre-existing co-morbidities -- continuing the trend that risk of severe disease is markedly increased in individuals with pre-existing co-morbidities.

An Indonesian has contracted the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and is currently undergoing treatment in Abu Dhabi, a Health Ministry official said.

"An Indonesian citizen has tested positive for MERS-CoV," secretary of the ministry's directorate general of disease control and sanitation Muhammad Subhan said, as quoted by Antara news agency on Wednesday [18 Jun 2014].

The Indonesian, who is a resident of Surabaya in East Java, contracted the virus while in Saudi Arabia performing umrah (minor haj pilgrimage), he said.

"The Indonesian has not been allowed to return home after testing positive for the virus," he said.

The Health Ministry has so far detected 169 suspected cases of MERS-CoV. Of the 169 suspected cases, 161 have been declared negative, while the other 8 are being monitored.

"We will be monitoring the 8 people for the next 14 days. We have also examined samples of their blood," he said.

"Overall, no suspected case of MERS-CoV infection has been declared positive in Indonesia. Indonesia is still free from MERS-CoV," he said.

[In the absence of specific information on nationality of cases, this moderator has had significant difficulties trying to reconcile media reports with national reports, and national reports with WHO confirmation reports. The above media report suggests this is a newly diagnosed case of MERS-CoV infection in an individual from Indonesia who was performing umrah (lesser pilgrimage to the Muslim holy sites in Saudi Arabia) and is currently under treatment in Abu Dhabi, UAE. Presumably this case will be further investigated and more epidemiologic information will be available in the report from the UAE to WHO. Types of information that would be helpful would include demographic information (age/gender), locations visited, possible high-risk exposures (healthcare facility visits, camel farm visits, drinking raw or uncooked camel material, including meat, milk and urine), and contact with other known/previously diagnosed cases of MERS-CoV infection.

WHO statement on the 6th Meeting of the IHR Emergency Committee concerning MERS-CoV
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 6th meeting of the Emergency Committee convened by the Director-General under the International Health Regulations (2005) concerning Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was held by teleconference on Monday, [16 Jun 2014], from 12:15 to 16:19 Geneva time (CEST).

List of members and advisers of the Committee [list available at: http://www.who.int/ihr/procedures/emerg_comm_members_20140616/en/]
In addition to Members of the Emergency Committee, 3 expert advisors participated in the informational session only. These advisors did not participate in the formulation of advice to the Director-General.

Seven affected States Parties reporting cases of MERS-CoV or evidence of infection since the 5th meeting of the Committee were also on the 1st part of the teleconference: Algeria, Iran, Jordan, Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and United States of America.

The WHO Secretariat provided an update on and assessment of epidemiological and scientific developments, including a description of recently reported cases, transmission patterns, and the main observations of a recent WHO mission to UAE.

Affected countries gave information about recent events in their countries, including description of cases, measures taken and their concerns about the current situation.

The Committee discussed the information provided. Based on current information, the Committee indicated that the situation remains serious in terms of public health impact. However, the upsurge in cases that began in April [2014] has now decreased, and there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in communities. There have been significant efforts made to strengthen infection prevention and control measures. As a result, the Committee unanimously concluded that the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have not yet been met.

However, the Committee emphasized that the situation continues to be of concern, especially given the anticipated increase in travel to Saudi Arabia related to Umra, Ramadan and the Hajj. The Committee focused attention on the need to further analyse the hospital outbreaks to better understand where breaches in infection prevention and control are taking place, including where patients who have not yet received a diagnosis gather and wait, often under crowded conditions, such as in emergency departments and clinics. The Committee also noted that recent investigative findings increasingly support the hypothesis that camels are an important source of exposure to MERS-CoV in the community.

The Committee reiterated that its previous advice remains relevant, and that all countries should:
- strengthen efforts to implement basic infection prevention and control measures, and increase education on these measures, especially among health care workers;
- continue efforts to complete critical investigations as soon as possible, including case-control, serological, environmental, and animal studies, to better understand the epidemiology, especially risk factors; and to assess where breakdowns in infection prevention and control measures are occurring , and to share preliminary findings;
- support strengthening capacities in vulnerable countries, especially those in Africa, and that these countries, and particularly those in Africa, should take concrete action in anticipation of Umra, Ramadan and Hajj with respect to basic public health actions such as conducting surveillance for MERS-CoV, raising awareness about and implementing basic infection prevention and control measures;
- improve awareness about MERS-CoV among the pilgrims who are planning to go for Umra and Hajj, especially for those with chronic illness, and for accompanying medical delegations to be made aware of how to detect MERS, and personal hygiene and basic infection control precautions;
- continue to enhance awareness through effective risk communication concerning MERS-CoV to the general public, health professionals, and policy makers;
- strengthen intersectoral collaboration and joint activities between animal and human health sectors;
- share with WHO all relevant information needed to assess and manage MERS, in a timely manner, as required by the International Health Regulations (2005); and
- use WHO recommendations, including for groups at higher risk of infection with MERS-CoV:
-- WHO travel advice on MERS-CoV for pilgrimages [available at: http://www.who.int/ith/updates/20140603/en/]
-- Update on MERS-CoV transmission from animals to humans, and interim recommendations for at risk groups [available at: http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/MERS_CoV_RA_20140613.pdf?ua=1]
-- Assessment of potential risk factors of infection of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) among health care personnel in a health care setting [available at: http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/Healthcare_MERS_Seroepi_Investigation_27Jan2014.pdf?ua=1
-- Interim surveillance recommendations for human infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [available at: http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/InterimRevisedSurveillanceRecommendations_nCoVinfection_27Jun13.pdf?ua=1]

Finally, the Committee indicated that there was no solid information to support the use of thermal screening as a means to stop or slow the entry of MERS-CoV infections, and that resources for supporting such screening could be better used to strengthen surveillance, infection control and prevention or other effective public health measures.

Based on the Committee's advice, and information currently available, the Director-General accepted the Committee's assessment. She thanked the Committee for its work.

The WHO Secretariat will continue to provide regular updates to the Committee Members and Advisors. In view of the Committee's ongoing concerns, the Emergency Committee will be reconvened in September 2014, or earlier if circumstances require.

[Given the apparent decrease in transmission of the MERS-CoV in the region during the past 2 weeks, it is not surprising that the Emergency Committee voted not to declare the MERS-CoV current activity as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Such a declaration would carry with it recommended travel restrictions and have significant economic impact on the region. Reviewing the timeline trends of dates of onset of laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, a seasonality seems to have been present, with increases in transmission seen during the period April and May -- the 1st nosocomial outbreak occurred in Zarga, Jordan in April 2012, the 2nd "major" nosocomial outbreak occurred in Al Ahasa, Saudi Arabia in April 2013, and significantly larger nosocomial outbreaks occurred in Riyadh and Jeddah in April/May 2014. That being said, an undercurrent concern is the continued occurrence of sporadic cases, especially the observed cases in individuals who are making umrah (the "lesser pilgrimage" done throughout the year), but with an observed increase in pilgrims during the month of Ramadan (which will begin 28 Jun 2014 and will continue for 30 days until 27 Jul 2014). The Moroccan MOH is now recommended that Moroccans not perform the Hajj this year (see http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=66635) due to concerns surrounding MERS-CoV transmission. - Mod.MPP]

[4] WHO recommendations for at-risk groups - 13 Jun 2014

Update on MERS-CoV transmission from animals to humans, and interim recommendations for at-risk groups
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Over the past year [2013/2014], several investigations into the animal source of MERS-CoV have been conducted. MERS-CoV genetic sequences from humans and camels in Egypt, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia demonstrate a close link between the virus found in camels and that found in people in the same geographic area. These and other studies have found MERS-CoV antibodies in camels in Africa and the Middle East.

Preliminary results from an ongoing investigation in Qatar show that people working closely with camels (e.g., farm workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians) may be at higher risk of MERS-CoV infection than people who do not have regular close contacts with camels. In Qatar and several other countries, animals, including goats, cows, sheep, water buffalo, swine and wild birds, have been tested for antibodies to MERS-CoV, with no positive results. The absence of antibodies in these animals indicates that the likelihood of other animals having a substantial role in transmission of MERS-CoV is very low. These studies provide evidence that camels are a likely primary source of the MERS-CoV that is infecting humans.

The current pattern of disease appears to be the result of repeated introductions of the virus from camels to people, resulting in limited human-to-human transmission, but not in sustained transmission. Therefore, discovery of the routes of transmission, whether direct or indirect, between camels and people, is critical to stopping transmission of the virus. WHO is working with partner agencies with expertise in animal health and food safety, including FAO, OIE and national authorities, to facilitate ongoing investigations.

Investigation protocols and guidelines for dealing with new cases are available on the WHO website (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/).

General recommendations
-----------------------
As a general precaution, anyone visiting farms, markets, barns or other places where camels are present should practice general hygiene measures, including regular hand washing after touching animals, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with hands, and avoiding contact with sick animals. People may also consider wearing protective gowns and gloves while handling animals.

The consumption of raw or undercooked animal products, including milk and meat, carries a high risk of infection from a variety of organisms that might cause disease in humans. Animal products processed appropriately through proper cooking or pasteurization are safe for consumption but should also be handled with care, to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods. Recent studies in Qatar show that MERS-CoV can be detected in raw milk from infected camels. Whether camels excrete MERS-CoV in milk or the virus gets into the milk through cross-contamination during milking is unclear. However, if MERS-CoV is present, it will be destroyed by pasteurization or cooking. Camel meat and camel milk are nutritious products that can continue to be consumed after cooking, pasteurization, or other heat treatments. Safe alternatives should be developed to the tradition of sales of raw camel milk for direct consumption, along roadsides and farm gates.

Recommendations for at-risk groups
----------------------------------
Until more is understood about MERS, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid contact with camels, should not drink raw camel milk or camel urine, and should not eat meat that has not been properly cooked. Such recommendations should also be disseminated to travellers, tourists and pilgrims with above mentioned underlying conditions coming to the region from around the world.

Preliminary results from recent studies in Qatar indicate that people handling or working with camels are at increased risk of infection with MERS-CoV compared with people who do not have contact with camels. Until more evidence is gathered, it is prudent for camel farm workers, slaughterhouse workers, market workers, veterinarians and those handling camels at racing facilities to practice good personal hygiene, including frequent hand washing after touching animals. They should wear facial protection where feasible and protective clothing, which should be removed after work and washed daily.

Workers should also avoid exposing family members to soiled work clothing, shoes, or other items that may have come into contact with camel excretions. It is therefore recommended that these clothes and items remain at the workplace for daily washing and that workers have access to and use shower facilities at their workplaces before leaving the premises.

Camels infected with MERS-CoV may not show any signs of infection. It is therefore not possible to know whether an animal in a farm, market, race track or slaughterhouse is excreting MERS-CoV that can potentially infect humans. However, infected animals may shed MERS-CoV through nasal and eye discharge, faeces, and potentially in their milk and urine. The virus may also be found in the organs and meat of an infected animal. Therefore, until more is known about infection in animals, the best protection is to practice good hygiene and avoid direct contact with all of these. Obviously sick animals should never be slaughtered for consumption; dead animals should be safely buried or destroyed.

People who are not wearing protective gear should avoid contact with any animal that has been confirmed positive for MERS-CoV until subsequent tests have confirmed that the animal is free of the virus.

[The revised WHO guidelines for "at-risk" individuals presented above is heavily focused at recommendations for reducing exposures to camels and their products such as meat, urine and milk. While there have been many studies focused on identifying the prevalence of MERS-CoV infections in camels (most of the studies to date have been "convenience samples" and do not have information on actual prevalence in geographic areas), this moderator wonders what types of studies are being conducted on the bats in the region. The initial description of the MERS-CoV placed it phylogenetically related to a bat coronavirus (see Novel coronavirus - Saudi Arabia: human isolate 20120920.1302733 and Novel coronavirus - Saudi Arabia (16): whole genome sequence 20121114.1409556). If so, are bats on the Arabian Peninsula reservoirs for the virus, and are they another source of transmission of this virus to humans, and if so, how? Not all of the cases have a history of contact with camels or camel products, or contact with other confirmed MERS-CoV infected individuals, or contact with the health sector, during the incubation period.

The global tally of laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection remains a challenge to reconcile with the variety of sources providing information on cases, but not always sufficient information that permits reconciling between the sources. To illustrate the range in possible global case counts, according to the most recent WHO tally, as of 16 Jun 2014, there have been 701 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 249 related deaths (see MERS-CoV (01): Bangladesh, KSA, Algeria, UAE, Iran, WHO, RFI 20140616.2541707). According to the ECDC epidemiologic update, as of 4 Jun 2014, there were 815 cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by local health authorities worldwide, including 313 deaths, and in the 16 Jun 2014 weekly update, there was mention of an additional 11 cases (see http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/press/news/_layouts/forms/News_DispForm.aspx?List=8db7286c-fe2d-476c-9133-18ff4cb1b568&ID=1016 and http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/press/news/_layouts/forms/News_DispForm.aspx?List=8db7286c-fe2d-476c-9133-18ff4cb1b568&ID=1022). In contrast, as of today (19 Jun 2014), the global tally of laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection maintained by FluTrackers is 833 cases (see http://www.flutrackers.com/forum/showthread.php?t=205075).

In the last ProMED-mail update, there was a media report of a case of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection in a Bangladeshi national who travelled from the USA to Bangladesh via Abu Dhabi, UAE. According to a CIDRAP report of today (19 Jun 2014), WHO told the CIDRAP reporter that testing by a reference lab outside of Bangladesh was negative (see http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2014/06/who-mers-report-bangladesh-looks-false-alarm for details). While we await an official statement from either the Bangladesh MOH or WHO, it is a relief as the individual just transited through Abu Dhabi during 3 hours, and if positive, this would have been the 1st case of MERS-CoV in a traveller where transmission occurred during the actual travel period, either in the airport or on an airplane. - Mod.MPP]
