The District Health Office - Hadera, the veterinary services in Umm al-Fahm reported that 2 residents of the city fell ill with relapsing fever (_Borrelia_) after they stayed inside a cave in the Sharaya area. Accordingly, the veterinary services in the Umm al-Fahm municipality warn trekkers in the Al-Sharaya area not to enter the caves due to the seriousness of this disease, as the 2 injured stayed in the hospital for 5 days.

What is relapsing fever (cave fever)? A disease caused by a microscopic bacterium called _Borrelia_, which is transmitted to humans through the bites of soft ticks. Rodents are the main source of _Borrelia_ bacteria. Soft ticks live in the floors and crevices of caves and are very sensitive to the change in carbon dioxide concentration inside the cave. They wake up looking for a brooder to take a blood meal as food, leaving bacteria in the infected blood and then fall to the ground to lay eggs.

The incubation period of the disease lasts for several days, after which the disease appears in the form of a fever with a sudden and rapid rise in body temperature. The attacks are accompanied by the appearance of one or more of the following symptoms: coughing, shortness of breath, feeling sick, muscle and joint pain, and skin rash.

Umm al-Fahm is a city (population, 56 109 residents in 2019, nearly all of whom are Arab citizens of Israel), located 20 km (12 miles) northwest of Jenin in the Haifa District of Israel (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umm_al-Fahm). A map showing the location of Umm al-Fahm can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Umm+al-Fahm,+Israel.

Prompted by a ProMED post (Tick-borne relapsing fever - USA: (TX) cave workers, 2017 20180420.5759542) of several cases of relapsing fever in Texas among cave workers, Dr. Steve Berger commented that the Israeli equivalent of the disease is known as "cave fever," with most cases reported among tourists in caves. He noted that "the regional pathogen, _Borrelia persica_ is found in approximately 10% of caves and is transmitted by _Ornithodorus tholozani_, an argassid ("soft") tick. The annual incidence has remained fairly stable at 5 to 15 cases for the past 5 decades. See graph at https://www.gideononline.com/2018/04/21/cave-fever-in-the-united-states-and-israel/."

In 2000, ProMED posted a report from Dr. Itzhaki concerning occasional outbreaks of tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) among military personnel in Israel during the previous several decades, as well as cases of TBRF in tourists returning home from Israel (Borreliosis, relapsing fever, soldiers - Israel 20000423.0602). In a subsequent ProMED post, Dr. Berger reported that TBRF in Israel is most often acquired in caves and bunkers (underground bomb shelters?), the local vector, _O. tholozani_, is widely distributed in the northern highlands, coastal plain and Negev desert, and that approximately 10% of caves in Israel are infested (Borreliosis, relapsing fever - Israel: background 20000423.0607). Another report says that 30-60% of caves in Israel were found to be infested and that PCR studies of _Borrelia_ infection of _O. tholozani_ ticks collected in caves showed very variable rates, ranging from less than 2% to 40% (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X14607059). Mammalian reservoirs are not known but may be rodents (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3381401/).

Physicians should be aware of TBRF in returning febrile tourists who spent time in caves in Israel (https://www.israel21c.org/top-10-caves-of-israel/, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3367340/) or elsewhere (http://www.wemjournal.org/article/S1080-6032(11)00069-X/pdf). ProMED has also posted reports of other diseases acquired in caves, including Q fever and histoplasmosis (see See Also section below), as well as other diseases, such as rabies and leptospirosis (https://www.wemjournal.org/article/S1080-6032(11)00069-X/pdf). - Mod.ML
