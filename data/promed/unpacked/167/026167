The risk from migratory birds carrying the H5N1 virus from Africa to
Europe may be easing but countries looking to relax measures
protecting their poultry still need to be on guard, experts said on
Thursday. The spring migration involving millions of birds from
Africa to the northern hemisphere has been underway for weeks, and
yet so far there has been no recorded case of the Asian bird flu
strain in Europe linked to wildfowl from the continent.
Conservation groups say the international trade in poultry is more to
blame for spreading the virus that has killed more than 100 people,
mostly in Asia.
But [some, not all] animal health experts still believe migration is
key, saying one reason H5N1 has not spread from Africa may be that it
has largely been confined to poultry farms in the 6 African countries
to confirm cases. "We know that in Africa there may be few wild
infected birds, but a few wild infected birds can be enough to get an
outbreak," Christianne Bruschke, head of the bird flu task force at
the World Animal Health Organisation (OIE), told Reuters. "We haven't
seen outbreaks in Europe or the United States, which is very good,
but it doesn't mean it's impossible for an infected bird to fly from
Africa to Europe or North America."
The African migration season lasts until the end of May, but already
some European countries have begun easing bans on keeping their
domestic poultry flocks outside. Major poultry exporter the
Netherlands said it believed the migratory risk had now passed.
The bird flu cases found so far in Europe have been linked to
infected swans and other wildfowl displaced by extreme cold weather
around the Black Sea earlier this year. A government spokesman in
France, which has recorded more than 60 wild bird cases, said
none had come from Africa.
One country that has had no bird flu is Spain, despite fears that
migrating birds would bring the virus north from Africa. Juan Jose
Badiola, head of the Spanish Veterinary Association, said aquatic
birds that return to Spain from Africa in the spring tended to winter
on the West African coast between Mauritania and Senegal, where there
have been no cases. "The risk for Spain now is less than it was 2
months ago, but it's too early to lower our guard," he said. "This is
a highly contagious disease and it's moving west within Africa."
Conservation groups such as Birdlife International say the pattern of
the spread of the virus suggests migration is not to blame in many
cases, including those in Africa. "Recent outbreaks in Cameroon,
Egypt, India, Israel, Jordan, Niger, Nigeria and Pakistan originated
within the poultry industry," Birdlife said in a statement. "The
timing and location of these outbreaks do not match the movements of
migratory birds."
The groups acknowledge certain wildfowl species can carry the virus
but say the birds die after flying relatively short distances. Only
by transmitting the disease to other birds can the virus be passed
long distances.
And at a conference organised by the Lancet medical journal this week
in Singapore, a top flu expert also warned the scientific community
against blaming migratory birds. "We forget that there is an enormous
commercial industry with the movement of animals all the time. That,
to me, is the most obvious thing to look for," said Kennedy
Shortridge, who spent 3 decades studying influenza viruses. "Lots of
people don't realise that there's movement of poultry from one
country to another, even to Nigeria, where we've got bird flu. People
are transporting all sorts of poultry meat," he said.
The OIE says more research is needed into which species are more
susceptible to the virus and how long birds can fly with it. However,
it still believes migration is a major factor. "My firm belief is
that the migration of birds carries the virus over big distances,"
Bruschke said. "And within regions it is spread more by (trade)
movements of birds, which could be legal or illegal," she added.

[Obviously, to quote the British saying, "You pays your money and
takes your choice." Or to put it another way, as I advise my
students, "Never lie or make up data. Nature is illiterate and
therefore never reads the scientific literature. Therefore she does
not know what, according to the literature or Ministerial reports,
she should be doing and therefore does what she does, your opinions
notwithstanding." As this problem settles out, it seems to depend on
how far which species of infected birds can effectively transport
H5N1 while migrating. Commercial international transport of poultry
probably has no such restrictions but it would be nice to have
documented cases of successes and failures. In the meanwhile it would
appear that H5N1 has not (yet) been brought back to Europe from West
Africa. - Mod.MHJ]
