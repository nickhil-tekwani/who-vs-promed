BSE, imports of German beef suspended - Algeria 20000117105226

A grave error has occurred in the ProMED-mail of Monday, 17 Jan 2000,
citing the North Africa Journal, 11 Jan 00, leading to immeasurable losses
to the German livestock breeding industry. The disease under consideration
is not BSE, but the disease Bovine Herpes Virus no. 1 (BHV1), also called
Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR). I wish to point out that in cattle
born in Germany BSE has never occurred so far.
Furthermore, the cattle in question were German pedigree dairy heifers for
breeding and no imports of beef.
We would be grateful to receive a copy of the cited article in the North
Africa Journal in order to assess whether the mistake occurred through you
wrongly citing the North Africa Journal or whether the error already
occurred in the article mentioned.
We have acknowledged in principle the quarantine measures have not been
sufficient and some form of compensation would be justified, but no amounts
have, so far, been communicated to us.

[I hope that Dr. Meyn will reconsider his position. This error was not due
to Kathleen Dunleavy who forwarded the article, it was due to the misprint
in the Farmbid.com posting via the North African Journal. The article can
be found on the web site:
<http://www.farmbid.com/news/archive/2000/1/14/1268.asp>. The article was
taken from here as it is in the electronic media and therefore freely
accessed by the public. - Mod.TG
