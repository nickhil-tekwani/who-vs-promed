Finnish _Salmonella_ outbreak sickens more than 50 people
---------------------------------------------------------
The number of people in a _Salmonella_ outbreak in Finland has doubled to more than 50, according to public health officials. In July [2022], 27 people in different parts of Finland were reported to have fallen ill with _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Mbandaka infections. As of early September [2022], 54 people have been sickened in the outbreak.

Patients fell sick between [April and August 2022] and 31 of them are women. Their average age is 29 and the range is under 1 to 74 years old. Four people were hospitalized because of their infections and only 1 patient had traveled abroad before becoming ill, said the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL).

From 38 patients interviewed, 36 had eaten various chicken products before becoming ill, either at home or when eating out. The Finnish Food Authority (Ruokavirasto) and local agencies are tracing potential sources based on information given in the interviews but so far no common product has been identified.

[More cases have occurred and now chicken is suspected to be the vehicle for transmission. Utilizing good kitchen hygiene and adequate cooking of the chicken will decrease the risk of transmission. - Mod.LL
