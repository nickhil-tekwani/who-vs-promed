Abstract
Middle East Respiratory syndrome coronavirus was passaged in Vero cells up to passage 400. Next generation sequencing showed progressive deletions leading to total loss of ORF 3, 4a,4b, and most of ORF 5. The transmissibility and virulence of this deletion variant remains to be evaluated.

[Dr. Zaki 1st described the isolation of MERS-CoV, and he continues research on it in Egypt. He is confident that this 400-long passage has weakened the virus. In communications with ProMED, he indicated that RNAs from different passages were sent to Dr. Marcel Muller in Germany, and next generation sequencing demonstrated deletions in all accessory genes and that approximately 2000 base pairs have been lost on passage. One hopes that this passaged virus will lead to a vaccine candidate. We thank Dr. Zaki for communicating this work to us. - Mod.LM]

[It is well documented that viruses change with cell culture passage, either through mutation, deletions, changes in receptors, other changes. A paper just came out on another coronavirus, SADS-CoV (swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus) /CN/GDWT/2017, which was passaged in Vero cells for up to 83 passages. Of these, 4 strains were characterized following passage in which mutations in the ORF1a/b, N, S, E, M and NS3a were identified, as well as a 58bp deletion in NS7a/7b. While this deletion is certainly less dramatic than the one described by Zaki, it is nonetheless attenuated. (Y Sun et al. 2019. Virology 538:61 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2019.09.009). Others have shown that accessory genes of coronaviruses are not necessary for growth in vitro. And there are many examples of virulent virus attenuated through cell culture passage. - Mod.LK]

[Although this passaged virus well may be attenuated, it will require the 3 standard phases of testing for safety and innocuity. Given the regular occurrence of MERS cases and resulting deaths, a vaccine would be a significant contribution to public health in the regions where the virus is endemic and causing problems. Interestingly, a Phase Ib clinical trial in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has been launched to evaluate a vaccine candidate to protect people against MERS-CoV. Announced on 19 Dec 2019, this limited study will be the 1st clinical trial focused on MERS-CoV to be conducted in the KSA (see MERS-CoV (76): Qatar, Saudi Arabia, new vaccine trial, WHO 20191226.6858986). Eradication of the virus in the dromedary camel population is not possible at this time. Perhaps Dr. Zaki's passaged virus could serve as a candidate for camel vaccination. Tests would be worthwhile. ProMED-mail will be interested in reading published results of the current and any future work of Dr. Zaki's on MERS-CoV. - Mod.TY]
