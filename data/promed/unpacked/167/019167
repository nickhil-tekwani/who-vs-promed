Cases of deadly mosquito-borne Japanese encephalitis [JE] have risen nearly 5-fold in 5 years in India's northeast Assam state as a result of warming weather and changing rainfall, health experts say.

Between 2010 and 2014, the number of annual cases rose from 154 to 744, with deaths rising from 41-160, according to data from the Assam health department. The disease, which in 2009 was recorded in only half of the state's districts, now is seen in all of them.

Doctors say climate change has played a major role in the spread of the disease, which once appeared largely from May to July but now is seen as late in the year as November, as mosquitoes survive longer in warmer conditions.

Japanese encephalitis is characterized by inflammation of the brain and high fever.

"Now, the temperature ... which is ideal for breeding of the _Culex_ mosquito, is present almost until October or so, and as a result of this, the cases of the disease are increasing," said Rabindra Nath Talukdar, a senior official of the Assam health department.

"Initially, it was only an upper Assam disease ... but now it has also been detected in lower Assam districts, and (now) cases have been reported from all the 27 districts in Assam," Talukdar said.

Health department officials said changes in agricultural patterns may be affecting the rise in encephalitis cases. Warmer conditions have allowed farmers to grow more crops of rice each year, which means rice paddies with standing water offer a breeding ground for mosquitoes for a larger part of each year. "The _Culex_ mosquito breeds on water in the agricultural land, and now since there is water on the field for several more months than before, it gives more time and space for the mosquito to breed," Talukdar said.

Faced with a surge in Japanese encephalitis cases, the Assam government has announced measures to tackle the problem, including more careful monitoring of cases. Assam Health Minister Nazrul Islam described the situation as "a huge concern. I have asked the senior officials of the health department to monitor the situation carefully and to report to me on a regular basis," he said.

Faced with a growing public outcry over the disease's rapid spread, Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi has ordered officials of the Assam health department to develop a plan to control the disease.

Plans should include "setting up of an intensive care unit in each district hospital for treatment of emergency cases, along with laboratory testing units," Gogoi said. As well, "I have already asked the health department to procure laboratory testing kits for quick diagnosis of the disease, adequate vaccines and medicines for the hospitals, and also to carry out intensive fogging in the affected areas," he said.

Civil society groups and activists have, however, questioned why such steps were not taken earlier. "The data from the state health department itself shows that the disease has taken a deadly turn over the years in the state. Unfortunately, the state machinery waited for the disease to go out of control, whereas it should have taken steps to control the disease much earlier," said Sankar Prasad Rai, of the All Assam Students Union (AASU).

Several influential student groups of the state, including the All Assam Students Union and the Assam Jatiyatibadi Yuva Chatra Parishad (AJYCP), have staged protests over the government's failure to control the spread of Japanese encephalitis.

[The encephalitis picture in northeastern India is complicated. The JE virus etiology of some encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests. However, many cases go undiagnosed or JE virus infection is ruled out, and other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, have been proposed.

The above report indicates that the cases referred to in Assam are JE. Increased surveillance, coupled with timely laboratory support, is very important for any control efforts to be successful. Although delivery of JE virus vaccine to hospitals is mentioned, it is curious that no mention is made of an Assam-wide vaccination campaign, nor is there mention of campaigns in previous years. Vaccination is more likely to be more effective for prevention of JE cases than vector control, particularly with the increase in the areas of paddy rice cultivation that provide _Culex_ vector mosquito breeding sites. The virus doubtless is endemic in northeastern India. Ardeid birds [heron family] are reservoir hosts.

ProMED 1st reported JE in Assam in 1998 and has carried reports annually since 2003. It would indeed be good to develop a plan to control the disease there. Vaccination works well in other parts of India. - Mod.,JW]
