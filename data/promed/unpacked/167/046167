A plague outbreak in Madagascar has infected 1192 people since August 2017, with 124 deaths, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs [OCHA] and Madagascar's National Bureau of Risk Management and Disaster reported on [Mon 23 Oct 2017].

The majority of cases, 67 percent, were the pneumonic form of the disease, which can spread from person to person.

Plague is caused by infection with the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ and is typically spread through the bite of infected fleas, frequently carried by rats, causing bubonic plague. Symptoms include painful, swollen lymph nodes, called bubos, as well as fever, chills and coughing.

Pneumonic plague is more virulent or damaging and is an advanced form characterized by a severe lung infection that can be transmitted from person to person via airborne droplets such as through coughing or sneezing, for example. The incubation period is short, and an infected person may die within 12 to 24 hours. Both forms can be treated with antimicrobials, making early detection a priority.

Of Madagascar's 114 districts, 40 have reported cases of pneumonic plague and less than 30 percent of people who have had contact with cases can be traced, according to the UN office. Those who've been in contact might need treatment themselves and may pose further risk of spreading the infection. Cases have been reported in at least 10 cities, including the larger, more populated, cities of Antananarivo and Toamasina. But 780 individuals have been cured of their infection since 1 Aug 2017 and 6 of the affected districts have not reported new cases for 15 days, the UN report states. Despite the increase in numbers, the trend has been relatively stable, a World Health Organization representative told CNN.

Dr Charlotte Ndiaye, WHO representative in Madagascar, added that about half the deaths are occurring in the community, not health centers, according to government figures, which demonstrates that more work needs to be done to help people understand that treatment is available, and they need to go to health services as quickly as possible.

Plague is endemic to Madagascar, with an estimated 400 cases reported there every year, mostly the bubonic variety, but the current outbreak has affected more areas and started earlier than usual. It is also unusual for large urban areas to be affected, as they have been this year, the WHO previously told CNN.

The current outbreak began after the death of a man in the central highlands of the country -- a plague-endemic area -- after which the Ministry of Public Health began investigating and tracing his contacts, according to the WHO. The epidemic has garnered national and international control efforts. 8 health centers have been designated by WHO to manage plague cases and alleviate the burden on hospitals and health clinics. Last week [week of 16 Oct 2017] the International Federation of Red Cross also announced the deployment of a treatment center in the country.

WHO has also provided the medications to treat up to 5000 people and protect 100 000 people who may have been in contact with infected individuals. Both organizations have trained and mobilized thousands of volunteers. Protocols are also being proposed for safe burial practices to ensure maximum safety and protection from infection. Public schools are closed and the government has forbidden public gatherings, according to the Red Cross.

The risk of further spread nationally remains very high, WHO stated in its most recent situation report, and risk of regional spread is moderate due to neighboring islands and southern and east African countries. "The risk of international spread is low, because generally, people with plague are too sick to travel," Ndiaye told CNN in a previous report. She explained WHO is working closely with Madagascar's airport authorities to ensure control measures -- such as temperature checks and medical teams -- are in place at airports and ports to prevent the spread of infection outside the country.

[Sources reported 105 more cases of plague on 20 Oct 2017 than what has come out in the latest WHO report. There have been some irregularities in the numbers before but the number of deaths did climb. We await newer numbers.

With close to 65 percent of the cases diagnosed as pneumonic plague, the case fatality rate of about 8 percent seems quite low. - Mod.LL

A total of 30 health care students have contracted plague by intervening in the management of patients, since the beginning of the epidemic. The announcement was made by Hery Perez De Cuellar, president of the National Association of Interns inside the University Hospital Joseph Ravoahangy Andrianavalona (CHU JRA) yesterday, 23 Oct 2017. "We are weakly protected in the care of patients. The mouth covers used are those used by surgeons. The on-call blouses change only every 24 hours. And at the beginning of the epidemic, we bought ourselves this equipment," said the medical student, shocked.

These 7th and 8th year students of the Faculty of Medicine are an integral part of health personnel involved in the care of plague victims. "We receive the patients at the triage, do the tubing or the puncture for the rapid diagnostic test, and inject the patients. Sometimes we take samples from a corpse. So we are exposed to the bacteria at any time," testified these future doctors. The majority of these students are already healed, and some are still undergoing treatment. Others are on contact chemoprophylaxis.

These interns threaten to suspend their activities, if they do not have personal protective equipment. "We are not going to expose our lives to such a danger, however, knowing that other health workers receive more appropriate protection," they say.

The Ministry of Public Health denies this information. "They exaggerate. The delivery of equipment has been slightly delayed, but that's it; it arrived and was given to beneficiaries this afternoon (note: yesterday)," says a source from the ministry.

These students are not the only [healthcare] victims of this disease since the beginning of the epidemic. In 2 months, at least 2 dozen doctors, paramedics, and other health workers, have been affected and were cured.

[The following from my old friend Bob Weinstein (Kool JL, Weinstein RA: Risk of person-to-person transmission of pneumonic plague. Clin Infect Dis 2005; 40: 1166-72) summarizes what is known about person-to-person spread of _Y. pestis_. Although from 2005, it is not clear that there is much more recent data.

"Experimental data
------------------
During the Manchurian epidemic of 1910-11, Strong and Teague did experiments to characterize the airborne spread of the bacteria [7]. Agar plates were exposed for different durations at distances varying from 5 cm to 2 m from patients' mouths. All experiments were done with patients in the final stage of disease, who produced bloody sputum. Plates with visible drops of sputum were discarded. These experiments were done under extremely difficult conditions; their sensitivity to detect airborne bacteria is unknown. Only 1 of 39 plates held in front of non-coughing patients yielded positive results. The furthest observed distance of spread was 1 m (3.3 ft) (table 3). The only 2 plates that were exposed at 2 m (6.6 ft) were overgrown with other bacteria and could not be evaluated [7]. Other researchers have done similar experiments; the largest reported distance of spread varies from 50 cm to 1.12 m (1.6-3.7 ft) [6].

Discussion
----------
Pneumonic plague is perhaps the only disease for which we have to rely largely on information that is almost a century old. This information is often anecdotal, may have been subject to bias, and may not satisfy modern scientific standards. Nevertheless, I believe that the researchers of those days tried to be conscientious and professional, and that their assessments are still valuable. The historical accounts as well as the limited evidence from more recent outbreaks discussed in this article agree that pneumonic plague is not easily transmitted from one person to another. Most modern experts agree with this interpretation [9, 12], which was also strengthened by a mathematical model using data from published outbreaks that found an R0 value (that is, the average number of secondary cases per primary case) that was close to 1 [21].

Perhaps the most convincing evidence of the low risk of transmission is the absence of any documented human-to-human transmission of plague in the Untied States since 1925, long before effective antibiotics were available as prophylaxis for contacts. Antibiotic prophylaxis has been available since 1948. However, the diagnosis of plague often is delayed for several days, such as in the case of a patient in 1980 who was only diagnosed with plague 4 days after her death and after 180 persons had been in contact with her [22]. It is unlikely that post-exposure prophylaxis could have been responsible for prevention of all infections, if plague would be easily transmitted from person to person. The conclusion is that improved living conditions, better hygiene, better understanding of the disease, and a low underlying risk of infection must have been important factors for the absence of transmission.

The historical accounts I have cited show large differences in infection rates. These can probably be explained by differences in living conditions, hygiene, and observance of protective measures. There are no indications that differences in virulence or host factors could have played a role.

Transmission apparently occurs through direct contact or through inhalation of airborne droplets expelled by coughing persons. The very close contact required for transmission in clinical settings and the limited distance of spread demonstrated by experiments are indications that droplet nuclei do not play a significant role [23].

Patients in the early stage of pneumonic plague (approximately the 1st 20-24 h) apparently pose little risk [9]. This is likely because of the low counts of bacteria in their respiratory secretions and the general absence of coughing. Patients in the final stages of disease who cough sputum with much visible blood and/or pus pose the highest risk of infection.

Antibiotic medication rapidly clears the sputum of plague bacilli, so that a patient generally is not infective within hours after initiation of effective antibiotic treatment [8]. This means that in modern times many patients may not reach a stage where they pose a significant risk to others.

Simple protective measures can further reduce the risk of infection. This is evidenced by the numerous outbreaks that stopped as soon as the population at risk realized that they were dealing with a contagious disease and before public health authorities took measures to control it. The main factors preventing transmission must have included avoidance of direct contact with patients, maintenance of a greater physical distance between caretakers and ill persons, reduction of the time caretakers spent with each patient, and perhaps implementation of better hygienic practices, such as hand washing. In the Manchurian epidemics, a mask made of several layers of gauze seems to have protected almost all physicians who used it.

What precautions should health care workers take while caring for suspected pneumonic plague patients? In the case of a bioterrorist event involving plague, the health care system of a region will be easily overwhelmed, especially if strict isolation is instituted indiscriminately for many patients. Strict isolation by itself can reduce a patient's chance of recovery [24]. Therefore, it is important to carefully triage patients according to which patients should be nursed with precautions, and it is important to reevaluate precautions for patients who may no longer pose a risk. Protective measures, prophylaxis, and treatment of the patient should be commenced as soon as there is suspicion of pneumonic plague. However, the diagnosis of pneumonic plague should be confirmed by microbiological examination of respiratory secretions. If a bioterrorist event is suspected, it is also important to obtain an isolate to determine its antibiotic susceptibility, because the bacteria may have been engineered for resistance.

Recommendations have been published by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [25], the Working Group on Civilian Biodefense [2], and the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, and CDC's Hospital Infections Program [26]. All of these guidelines agree on an approach that balances the risk of person-to-person transmission with limited health care resources, and they include the following recommendations:
- implement droplet precautions for patients with suspected cases of pneumonic plague until they have received effective antibiotic treatment for 48 h (72 h of treatment is recommended in [26]);
- wear disposable surgical masks to help reduce the risk from large respiratory droplets. Because droplet nuclei are not thought to be a factor in the airborne spread of plague [2, 23], use of fitted N95 masks, full face pieces with N-/R-/P-100 filters, or powered air-purifying respirators with high-efficiency filters is not recommended.
- use standard precautions for non-pneumonic plague patients;
- monitor the body temperature of potentially exposed persons;
- consider post-exposure chemoprophylaxis for persons who have been in unprotected close contact (defined as coming within 2 m by [2] and [25] and within 1 m by [26]) with a person with pneumonic plague who has not received antibiotic treatment for at least 48 h. Doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, and cotrimoxazole can be used for prophylaxis. If possible, the choice of drug should be guided by the antimicrobial resistance profile of the isolated strain;
- Isolation of asymptomatic close contacts is not recommended."
