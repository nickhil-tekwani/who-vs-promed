Three cases of measles have been confirmed in the B.C. [British
Columbia] interior on the heels of an outbreak last month [March
2010] in the Metro Vancouver area. The Interior Health Authority said
the 3 cases are in Vernon, Lillooet and Williams Lake.

One has been traced back to overseas exposure, but health officials
say the other 2 people hadn't travelled outside their communities.
That means they can't be traced back to the measles outbreak in the
Vancouver area, in which there were 10 confirmed cases of the
disease, 8 of them from a single household.

The B.C. Centre for Disease Control said at the time it suspected
that 2 international visitors brought measles into Vancouver sometime
in February [2010] -- while the Olympics were on -- or in early March 2010.

None of the people who've gotten sick in either outbreak were fully
immunized, and health authorities are urging parents to make sure
their children's vaccinations are up to date.

[It may be that the presence of travelers from measles endemic areas
abroad are revealing inadequately vaccinated communities in the
population of British Columbia. Determination of the genotypes of the
viruses isolated from these individuals may provide an indication of
the origin of the viruses responsible for these apparently unconnected cases.
