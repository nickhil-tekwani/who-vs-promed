The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) is today (28 Jan 2015) closely monitoring 2 additional human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) notified by the Health and Family Planning Commission of Guangdong Province (GDHFPC), and again urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel. According to the GDHFPC, the 2 male patients aged 83 and 4, respectively, in Meizhou and Heyuan were hospitalised for management in critical and stable condition.

To date, 499 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been reported by the Mainland health authorities, respectively in Zhejiang (146 cases), Guangdong (137 cases), Jiangsu (63 cases), Shanghai (44 cases), Fujian (28 cases), Hunan (24 cases), Anhui (17 cases), Jiangxi (9 cases), Xinjiang (9 cases), Shandong (6cases), Beijing (5 cases), Henan (4 cases), Guangxi (3 cases), Jilin (2 cases), Guizhou (1 case) and Hebei (1 case).

[2] China: Serologic analysis H7N9

Avian Influenza A(H7N9) Virus Antibodies in Close Contacts of Infected Persons, China, 2013-2014. Ma MJ, Ma GY, Yang XX, Chen SH, Gray GC, Zhao T, et al. Emerg Infect Dis. 2014 Nov [date cited]. DOI: 10.3201/eid2104.141442

From early 2013 (1) through November 2014, over 460 human cases of laboratory-confirmed avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection occurred in China. Although human-to-human transmission of subtype H7N9 virus is not common, evidence has been reported of probable transmission among several family clusters (2), between 2 household contacts (3), and between a doctor and an infected patient (4). Taken together, these observations suggest that family members, health care providers, and other close contacts (hereafter called contacts) of H7N9-infected persons may be at risk for infection. Elevated levels of subtype H7N9 antibody among 6.7 percent of contacts during this epidemic in China [2013-2014] offer evidence that human-to-human transmission of H7N9 virus may occur among contacts of infected persons.

To determine whether unnoticed human-to-human transmission was occurring, the authors of the study took throat swabs from contacts of infected individuals and serum for serologic analysis. Their findings of elevated levels of subtype H7N9 antibody among 6.7 percent of contacts during this epidemic in China offer evidence that human-to-human transmission of H7N9 virus may occur among contacts of infected persons. ... - more

[The available epidemiological and virological information strongly indicates that most known human H7N9 infections result from direct contact with infected poultry, or indirect contact with infected poultry (for example, by visiting wet markets and having contact with environments where infected poultry have been kept or slaughtered). A minority of cases appear to have resulted from limited person to person transmission. Because H7N9 infections do not cause severe disease in poultry, this infection can spread "silently" among poultry. Under such circumstances, the exact exposure for individual cases of human infection may be difficult to establish.

Although there have been clusters* of infection (infections in people in close proximity to one another), the virus does not appear to transmit easily from one person to another, and further onward or sustained human-to-human transmission has not been reported despite investigations and follow up of cases and close contacts of cases (WHO http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/faq_H7N9/en/).

This study provides evidence that human-to-human transmission apparently may occur but is not sustained.
