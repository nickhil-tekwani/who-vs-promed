[FMD displays a seasonal pattern in Israel, though cases do not occur each year. Most cases recorded throughout the years occurred between January and May, peaking in March/April.

The distance between the 2 affected farms is about 10 km [about 6 mi]; both are adjacent to the border with south Lebanon. The region includes a dense wild boar population, which potentially can be a source of airborne viral spread; it would be interesting to sample/test some of them. - Mod.AS
