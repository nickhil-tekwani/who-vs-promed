Epidemiological comments: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 has been detected from wild birds but has not been detected from poultry except those smuggled by a passenger from Macau and intercepted at the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport in 2012. This report is the 1st reported case of HPAI H5N1 subtype (clade 2.3.4.4b) detected and confirmed in a poultry farm in Chinese Taipei. The breeding duck samples were collected by the local veterinary authority at Yilan County. Infected breeding ducks showed reduced egg production and sudden death. A total of 5010 ducks were culled, and the farm was thoroughly cleaned and disinfected on 20 Nov [2022]. Adjacent farms within 5 km [3.1 mi] radius of this farm will be taken under intensified surveillance for 3 months.

Control measures at event level
Domestic control measures applied: zoning, surveillance within the restricted zone, surveillance outside the restricted zone, stamping out, movement control, disinfection

Domestic control measures to be applied: screening

[As is mentioned in the epidemiological comments, this is the 1st reported case of HPAI H5N1 subtype (clade 2.3.4.4b) detected and confirmed in a poultry farm in Taiwan (Chinese Taipei). Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 has been detected from wild birds but not poultry.

"The 1st line of defense against avian influenza is the early detection and reporting of disease outbreaks to allow a rapid response. Putting in place accurate warning systems is thus essential to efficiently prevent and control the disease." - Mod.CRD
