The mysterious death of around 25 peacocks and a large number of other bird species, including pigeons, crows, and cranes near Khurda, has sparked fears of bird flu outbreak in the State [Odisha].

The birds were found lying dead near a water body at Madhupur village forest under Khurda Forest Division on Tuesday morning [8 Dec 2015]. Panicky villagers' informed Forest officials of Khurda and Chandaka divisions, who rushed to the spot and recovered the carcasses.

Some carcasses have been sent to OUAT [Orissa University of Agriculture and Technology] for preliminary examination. Samples would be sent to Animal Disease Research Institute (ADRI) of State Veterinary Department and National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSD), Bhopal, for determining the nature of deaths, Chandaka DFO [Divisional Forest Officer] Manoj Mohapatra said.

While the enmesh death of birds of multiple species has raised alarm, the Forest department has prima facie indicated slim chances of poisoning, both deliberate and accidental. The peacocks were resident birds with the community tolerant to their presence since years. Besides, the birds had not created any nuisance like damaging crops.

There was also no telltale sign of poisoning substances on the ground even as water samples from the water body have been sent for testing. In the event of deliberate poisoning too such a large number of birds feeding or drinking at the same time was a distant possibility, sources said.

"Nothing, however, is ruled out as yet. The cause of death will be confirmed after test reports come. An expert team from OUAT will also visit the site for ground examinations," Chandaka DFO Akshay Patnaik said.

Meanwhile, the mass bird deaths have put the officials on high alert as the forest lies on the edge of Chandaka Dompada Wildlife Sanctuary and close to the Chilika lagoon. With migratory season on and birds beginning to flock to the lake, authorities have enhanced surveillance measures to check for any unnatural behaviour or deaths. Samples will also be collected from different parts of the lagoon and sent to ADRI for testing, PCCF [Principal Chief Conservator of Forests] Wildlife Srivastav said.

Fisheries and Animal Resources department Secretary Bishnupad Sethi said an alert has been issued for Chilika and nearby forests. Community level surveillance will also be enhanced. "We are waiting for the report and all necessary steps will be taken to prevent any untoward turn," he said

[The heterogeneity of the species affected and the acuteness of the event are not necessarily indicative of avian influenza; however, this disease entity deserves to be excluded by laboratory tests. The results of the epidemiological and laboratory investigations, including toxicological tests, are requested. - Mod.AS
