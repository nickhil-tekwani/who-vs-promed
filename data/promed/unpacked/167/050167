The 5-day long Diwali [Hindu festival of lights] festivities came a nasty halt on Friday evening, 20 Oct 2017, for the families of at least 200 children in Dungarpur [Rajasthan] who suffered from food poisoning after they consumed kulfi at a fair. However almost all, except 3, were sent home after primary medical treatment. 2 children have been referred to the higher medical center, while 1 girl is still hospitalised in the district hospital. Meanwhile, the factory where the kulfi was produced has been seized and a team of health department officials have collected samples of the kulfi. According to sources, a Diwali fair had been organized At Mara Gamri village, 16 kilometers [about 10 mi] from Dungarpur district headquarter, in Ramsagra police station area. Following the incident, children were rushed to Gamri Ahara community health center from where they were further referred to district hospital.

"Around 180 children complained of vomiting and abdominal pain and were brought to the hospital," Dr Indar Lal Panchal, Principle Medical Officer at Dungarpur District Hospital told DNA. "Around 86 of them were immediately admitted to the hospital and the rest were given first aid and discharged. By Saturday evening, 21 Oct 2017, almost all of them have been discharged, as their condition improved. Only one girl is still admitted to the hospital, though her condition is normal as well, but is being kept under observation. 2 other children have been referred to higher center in Udaipur," Dr Panchal said.

The kulfi was produced at a factory situated in the industrial area of the city. On Sat 21 Oct 2017, a team of health department inspected and seized the factory and even collected samples of stored kulfi. "We have registered a case under relevant sections for further investigation. We area now awaiting results of the sample tests," said Ajay Singh Rao, SHO [station house officer], Ramsagra police station.

[The incubation period from eating the kulfi and the onset of vomiting and abdominal pain is not stated nor does the post relate whether any fever was present. It is probable that the etiology of the self-limited illnesses were related to staphylococcal enterotoxin and culture of the kulfi will reveal _S. aureus_.

Kulfi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kulfi) is a popular frozen dairy dessert from the Indian subcontinent. It is often described as "traditional Indian ice cream." It is popular throughout India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar, and the Middle East, and widely available in Indian restaurants in Australia, Europe, East Asia, and North America. It has similarities to ice cream in appearance and taste; however it is denser and creamier. Kulfi comes in various flavors, the more traditional ones are cream (malai), rose, mango, cardamom (elaichi), saffron (kesar or zafran), and pistachio. There are newer variations such as apple, orange, strawberry, peanut, and avocado. Unlike ice cream, kulfi is not whipped, resulting in a solid, dense frozen dessert similar to traditional custard-based ice cream. Thus, it is sometimes considered a distinct category of frozen dairy-based dessert. Due to its density, kulfi takes a longer time to melt than Western ice cream. The word "kulfi" is derived from the Persian word for a covered cup.

A quick recipe for mango kulfi (https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018932-quick-mango-kulfi) is:
"Ingredients
1 pint heavy cream
1 30-ounce can Alphonso mango pulp
1 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk
Zest of 1 lime
1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder
1 pinch salt

Preparation
In a large bowl mix all the ingredients until there are no streaks of color, then pour the mixture into a 9- or 10-inch loaf pan lined with plastic wrap (or individual freezer-safe ramekins). Place in the freezer, and allow to set for at least 10 hours, until frozen. Dip the outside of the pan in warm water, just long enough to release the kulfi. After you've used the plastic wrap to help you unmold neatly, throw it away. Slice and serve the kulfi immediately. If you're using ramekins, allow to sit at room temperature for a few minutes, then serve directly in the bowls."

Rajasthan (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan), literally "Land of Kings") is India's largest state by area (342 239 sq km (132 139 sq mi) or 10.4 percent of India's total area). It is located on the northwestern side of the India, where it comprises most of the wide and inhospitable Thar Desert (also known as the "Rajasthan Desert" and "Great Indian Desert") and shares a border with the Pakistani provinces of Punjab to the northwest and Sindh to the west, along the Sutlej-Indus river valley. Elsewhere it is bordered by 5 other Indian states: Punjab to the north; Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to the northeast; Madhya Pradesh to the southeast; and Gujarat to the southwest. - Mod.LL]
