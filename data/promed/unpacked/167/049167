Valencia's rice endangered by blast disease
-------------------------------------------
A high incidence of rice blast was detected in the region. The disease has
not been of much importance in the past but will damage rice yields if it
continues to increase. The current situation is due to warm temperatures,
very high humidity, and insufficient phytosanitary treatments. Areas near
the sea are most affected.

[Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Magnaporthe grisea_ (synonyms
_Pyricularia oryzae_, _P. grisea_). It is one of the most destructive
diseases of rice worldwide with potential yield losses of more than 50 per
cent. Symptoms include lesions on all parts of the shoot, stem rot, and
panicle blight. When nodes are infected, all plant parts above the
infection die and yield losses are severe. When infection occurs at the
seedling or tillering stages, plants are often completely killed. More than
50 species of grasses and sedges can be affected by different strains of
the fungus, but most strains isolated from rice can only infect a limited
number of cultivars.

Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by climatic
conditions. The disease is spread by infected plant debris, mechanical
means (including insect activity), water, and wind. Disease management may
include fungicides and cultural practices, but relies mainly on resistant
varieties. However, the fungus is highly variable and this favours the
emergence of new strains with increased virulence.
