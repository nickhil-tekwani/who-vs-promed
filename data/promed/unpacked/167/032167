Abstract
--------
Transmission of severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) between livestock and humans is a potential public health concern. We demonstrate the susceptibility of rabbits, which excrete infectious virus from the nose and throat upon experimental inoculation, to SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, investigations on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in farmed rabbits should be considered.

[The authors inoculated, in the laboratories of the Erasmus University, Rotterdam, 3 rabbits with 1 000 000 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) SARS-CoV-2 for a 21-day follow-up. Additionally, 3 groups of 3 animals each were inoculated with 10 000, 100 000, or 1 000 000 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2, and swabs were taken for 4 days before the animals were euthanized and autopsied. Results of viral tests, applied on sampled obtained in vivo or in vitro, are presented in detail. Animals inoculated with the lower doses presented less, shorter or no viral shedding. Despite the fact that no viral RNA was detected in the lungs, histological examination of the lungs of infected animals sacrificed 4 days post-inoculation (PI) revealed a multifocal mild to moderate increase in alveolar macrophages in the alveolar lumina with multifocal presence of few neutrophils (additional detail in the paper; see source URL).

They concluded: "This study demonstrates that rabbits are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. While the infection is asymptomatic, infectious virus with peak titers corresponding to about 1000 TCID50 could be detected up to day 7 PI in the nose. The minimum dose to establish productive infection was 100 000 TCID50, indicating that virus transmission between rabbits may be less efficient compared with ferrets and hamsters. The use of young, immunocompetent, and healthy New Zealand White rabbits in this study, however, may not reflect virus shedding and disease in other rabbit breeds or rabbits at different ages. Thus, surveillance studies -- including serological testing -- may be needed to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in farmed rabbits."

As reported in an earlier post (ProMED-mail. COVID-19 update (169): Netherlands (NB) animal, farmed mink, spread,
rabbit susp 20200509.7316646 -- see item 2), the initial findings of the experimental infection research, undertaken by Erasmus University in Rotterdam, which were indicative of rabbits being "sensitive to infection", led the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture/veterinary authorities to undertake screening for COVID-19 in rabbit farms. Details, as well as results of the tests performed on the collected samples, will be helpful. - Mod.AS
