This is regarding information on meningococcal disease in India and
is to inform you that in the cases of meningococcal disease that are
being reported in Delhi and Meghalaya states of the country, the
causative microorganism in both the places has been identified as
Group A meningococcus.

[_Neisseria meningitidis_ is divided into 13 serogroups, defined by
specific capsular polysaccharides, of which 4 are known to cause
epidemics: A, B, C and W135. Group A strains have caused epidemics of
meningococcal meningitis throughout the world. Serogroups A and C
predominate throughout Asia and Africa and serogroups B and C are
responsible for the majority of cases in Europe and the Americas.
Recently, serogroup W135 has been associated with meningococcal
disease amongst Hajj pilgrims and in sub-Saharan Africa. In India
serogroup A has been associated with all outbreaks of meningococcal
disease, although serogroup B and C have been detected in a few sporadic cases.
