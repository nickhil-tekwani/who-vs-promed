Philippines: Dengue Fever Alert in Iloilo Province
------------------------------------------------------
As of last week dengue hemorrhagic fever has already afflicted 28 in the
province of Iloilo, prompting health officials and Governor Niel D. Tupas
Sr. to raise a dengue alert in the province. Tupas also called on residents
to renew the practice of the "4 o'clock habit". The habit began in 1997
following the serious spread of dengue hemorrhagic fever that claimed the
lives of over 50 Ilonggos, mostly children. It calls residents to clean
their surroundings to prevent the spread of mosquitoes carrying the virus.
Provincial Health Officer Carmen Bayate calls the 4 o'clock habit "operation
kaya-kulub (upside down)," turning water catchers that are potential
breeding places upside down or draining them. Dr. Abayate reported to the
Governor that the disease had already spread to 12 towns in the period from
2 Jan to 9 Jun 2002. "This is not yet alarming considering that there are no
deaths and that on the average 2 people only fell ill monthly," noted Tupas.
During the height of the dengue epidemic 5 years ago, the Provincial
Government had to use fumigating machines to kill mosquitoes, but this was
discontinued after local authorities found the practice created more
problems. It polluted the air and hurt not just mosquitoes but friendly
organisms and people as well. It also only killed adult mosquitoes, not the
eggs which subsequently hatched [into mosquitoes to] pester people anew
within days of from the last fumigation.

El Salvador: Sixth Death Reported
--------------------------------
A 2-year-old boy here has died of dengue fever, the sixth victim of an
epidemic that has spread to 14 of El Salvador's provinces since January
2002, medical officials reported on Mon 17 Jun 2002. The boy died on Sunday
morning at a children's hospital in the capital, doctors said. More than
1200 cases of the mosquito-borne illness, most of them children younger than
12, have been documented since January 2002, medical officials said.

El Salvador: Assistance Arrives from Mexico
-------------------------------------------
A delegation of doctors from Mexico, with equipment and medicine, has
arrived in El Salvador to join the government campaign against the dengue
fever epidemic which has claimed 6 lives and infected 1301 people in the
Central American country.
The aid group from the Mexican Health Ministry's Epidemiological Vigilance
National Center, arrived on Sun 16 Jun 2002 in San Salvador, one of the 4
states which the Salvadorian government declared emergency states earlier
because of rampaging dengue. Another 27-strong task group, comprising
physicians, biologists, laboratory specialists and fumigation technicians,
is set to arrive on Monday [24 Jun 2002?] with fumigation equipment and
insecticide to be used to eliminate the nesting grounds of the _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquito, carrier and main transmitter of dengue fever.
Of the 1301 cases of dengue fever reported so far, 101 were classed as
dengue hemorrhagic fever. Last weekend 700 dengue-infected individuals went
to the Benjamin Bloom National Children's Hospital to receive medical
attention, and a similar situation was faced by other state and private
medical centers.

Situation Report: Dengue Virus Type 1 Present in El Salvador
------------------------------------------------------------
To date, 6 deaths caused by dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) have been
registered. Dengue virus type 1 has been identified in the country, which
increases the risk of a greater number of cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever.
PAHO/ELS is assisting the emergency dengue response system with 2
professionals and monitoring closely the situation.

[There is inconclusive evidence that DEN-1 following on a previous epidemic
of another dengue virus strain causes a higher rate of DHF than other
combinations. El Salvador suffered epidemics due to DEN-2 in 1987, DEN-3 in
1991 & DEN-4 in 1982. The first DHF cases appeared in the country during the
DEN-2 epidemic of 1987, 9 years after DEN-1 & 5 years after DEN-4 hit. -

The Ministry of Health of El Salvador reports 1584 cases of dengue from 1
Jan - 22 Jun 2002. This includes 1472 cases of classical dengue & 112 of
dengue hemorrhagic fever, with 5 deaths.
On Sat 22 Jun 2002 the number of suspected cases fell to 303, which was 97
less than the day before. The number of households with mosquito larvae fell
from 69 percent to 17 percent after the recent health education campaign.
El Salvador has declared a state of emergency because of the disease in the
Departments of Cabanas, La Libertad, Santa Ana & San Salvador. In the
capital the number of cases has exceeded the capacity of the principal
hospital that takes care of dengue patients.

Brazil (Goias): Number of Cases Down But Transmission Not Interrupted
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Since Jan 2002, 23 681 cases of classical dengue and 222 cases of dengue
hemorrhagic fever (DHF) were reported in the state of Goias, of which 49
were confirmed. There were 8 deaths suspected to be due to dengue -- 3
deaths were confirmed as due to DHF and 2 were due to classical dengue with
complications.
In spite of a dry season, various municipalities in Goias continue to have
transmission of dengue. The Coordinator of the State Dengue and Yellow Fever
control program, Gediselma Lima Borges, affirmed that while the number of
cases of dengue was reduced following the end of the rainy season,
transmission has not been interrupted. "At this moment it is extremely
important that the municipal directors structure the health units to ensure
that diagnosis and treatment of cases will occur when there is an increase
with the return of the rains."
She explained that the tendency, from now onwards, is that there is a
greater incidence of the more severe forms of the disease, with hemorrhagic
fever [DHF] and classical dengue with complications. This is due to several
reasons: an increase in people who have already had a prior infection,
greater mosquito density and circulation of 3 serotypes [of dengue virus].
The municipalities that continue to have dengue transmission are: Anapolis,
Aparecida de Goiania, Caldas Novas, Goiania, Guarani de Goias, Minacu, Padre
Bernardo, Rio Verde, Santa Teresinha de Goias, and Santo Antonio do
Descoberto.

Sri Lanka: Further Spread of Dengue Fever
----------------------------------------
Dengue fever has spread in Sri Lanka, with over 2000 positive cases
identified in May and 15 deaths reported, according to the Health Ministry
as of Mon 17 Jun 2002. A further 3400 suspected cases of dengue fever have
been reported from different parts of the country since the beginning of
this year, with 35 cases in Colombo city. The highest numbers of dengue
cases this year have been reported from the Gampaha district near the
capital Colombo.
In 2000 the epidemic reached its height when over 6000 suspected cases were
hospitalized throughout the country, and 35 lives were lost.
A change in weather patterns and heavy rains after a long spell of drought,
allowing mosquitoes to breed freely, is considered one of the causes for the
spread of the disease

More than 400 cases of dengue, including 57 of dengue hemorrhagic fever
(none fatal), have been notified during 2002 in Colima state, 490 km west of
the Mexican capital, mainly in Manzanillo municipality, as reported by
Beatriz Torres, District Health Secretary. This is less than the 4881
reports of classical dengue & 59 of DHF registered in 1997.
An intense campaign has checked 54 895 households, of which 27 785 had to be
treated because of larvae of the mosquito 'Aedes aegypti'. DEN-3 virus was
responsible for the epidemics of the last 3 years, but the current strain is
DEN-2.
Recently the health authorities of the southern state of Chiapas, bordering
Guatemala & one of the poorest in Mexico, reported that in the first 5
months of 2002 they had detected 38 cases of dengue, including 9 of DHF.
