Nyari N, Singh D, Kakkar K, Sharma S, Pandey SN, Dhole TN. Entomological and serological investigation of Japanese encephalitis in endemic area of eastern Uttar Pradesh, India.

Abstract
BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES:
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a mosquito borne pathogen, is one of the major causes of viral encephalitis in eastern Uttar Pradesh, India. The objective of this work was to evaluate the entomologically based virological surveillance of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in the highly endemic area of eastern Uttar Pradesh.

METHODS:
The study was carried out during September 2010 - March 2013 in Gorakhpur district of Uttar Pradesh. A total of 251 adult mosquito pools and 64 water samples containing larvae were collected from the District of Gorakhpur. Water pH, turbidity, and oxygen level were analyzed for vector breeding index (BI). In addition, 393 serum/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) suspected cases were collected from the district hospital.

RESULTS:
The various _Culex_ species found included, _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ (26 percent), _Cx. vishnui_ (22 percent), _Cx. pseudovishnui_ (21 percent), _Cx. tritaeniorhynchus_ (13 percent), _Cx. whitmorei_ (9 percent), and _Cx. gelidus_ (8 percent). Highest minimum infection rate (MIR) was calculated for _Cx. tritaeniorhynchus_ (2.32), followed by _Cx. vishnui_ (1.98) and _Cx. pseudovishnu_i (0.71). All the larvae samples were negative for JEV. The mean number larvae of _Cx. tritaeniorhynchus_ and _Cx. pseudovishnui_ was negatively correlated with pH (r = - 0.45 and r = - 0.63) and turbidity (r = - 0.30 and r = - 0.37). In contrast, positive correlation was observed in case of _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. A total of 41 clinical samples were found positive for JEV by IgM ELISA. The rainfall was significantly associated with Japanese encephalitis incidence and showed positive correlation to disease transmission (p = 0.02, r = 0.66).

INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION:
The findings showed the rapid dissemination of JEV within a population, facilitated by different species of _Culex_ in the region. As JE is a vaccine-preventable disease, an immunization programme, an effective vector control strategy, and application of standard hygiene practices in these endemic areas could result in a considerable reduction in morbidity and mortality due to JE.

[The Gorakhpur district of Uttar Pradesh state has been an active focus of JE cases annually. The above study identifies the major mosquitoes involved in transmission of the virus in this region. Vaccination is an effective measure for prevention of JEV, as the above report indicates. Vector control is more difficult, and the report does not indicate which approaches might be effective.

The report indicates that of the 393 CSF samples tested, presumably from encephalitis cases, only 41 were positive for JEV. That raises the same question that has arisen in many previous reports about the etiology of the non-JE cases. The encephalitis picture in northeastern India is complicated. The JE virus etiology of some previously reported encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests. However, many cases go undiagnosed, or JE virus infection is ruled out, and other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, lychee consumption, sun stroke, and enterovirus infection have been proposed. Ardeid birds (heron family) are reservoir hosts.
