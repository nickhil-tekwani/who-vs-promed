A new positive case of African swine fever [ASF] was discovered on 21 Oct 2019 in the Lagland camp in Arlon [Walloon municipality, Luxembourg province], in the infected area, report L'Avenir and Sudpresse [Sudinfo] on 30 Oct 2019. The results of the analysis of this boar's corpse have just reached the cabinet of minister Celine Tellier (Ecolo), in charge of African swine fever. The previous positive ASF case was on [11 Aug 2019], near Saint-Leger [Luxembourg].

This new discovery does not change anything concerning the control measures taken in early October [2019], namely a new ban on movement in the 30 000 hectares [about 74 132 acres] of infected Gaume forests.

However, this will extend for several weeks the deadline for the eradication of ASF [in Belgium]. "We can consider the virus eradicated when 12 months elapse since the last infected cadaver was discovered. With this new case, the period will be extended for a few weeks", said the spokesman for the minister, Nathalie Guilmin.

This discovery does not imply any modification concerning the zoning or measures applied.

[According to OIE's summary, the total number of ASF-infected wild boar in Belgium's south eastern province of Luxembourg, since the start of the event on 9 Sep 2018, and as of 19 Aug 2019 (last reported case) is 827 (801 were found dead and 26 were killed). With the addition of the new case, found in the Lagland military camp, the total becomes 828.

The origin of the Belgian wild boar event gave rise to several speculated scenarios regarding its origin. One of them related to the Lagland camp, where the 1st cases were located. It referred to the hypothesis that Czech, Polish, and Belgian soldiers who had been in the Baltic states -- countries where ASF already occurs -- could have brought contaminated food when arriving/returning to the Lagland military training facility. The origin of the event remains unclarified.

Belgium remains the only ASF-infected country in western Europe; see OIE's global ASF map (interactive, since 1 Jan 2016) at https://tinyurl.com/y2hzc7vu. To view the Belgian cases, click on the cluster and zoom in to the required resolution.

Recently, Danish media reported about 7 dead wild boar washed ashore at the Danish island of Aeroe (map at https://tinyurl.com/yxsldgjk). In the context of keeping Denmark free from ASF, the authorities disposed of the animals but did not check for the virus. An official veterinarian confirmed that the animals were found at different locations on the south coast of the island, and explained that "it is unlikely that the boar are of Danish origin" since, "We know that the Danish wild boar population, which is now 30-40 animals, is concentrated in southern Jutland close to the Danish-German border. So it is unlikely that these drowned animals are Danish." He further told "Pig Progress" that it does happen once or twice a year that carcasses of wild boar wash ashore in Denmark, but that it is the 1st time this has happened at Aeroe. Pig Progress' editor added: "to put things into perspective, from Aeroe to the nearest infected farm with ASF in northern Poland is over 600 km [about 373 mi] in a straight line, so just factual data make it rather unlikely that ASF would have killed these animals."
