Q fever, reported on about 55 goat farms in the Netherlands [see
commentary], has now also been reported in Belgium. In the
Netherlands, 6 people have died from the disease. The authorities in
Belgium say Q fever does not pose a major threat in Belgium, which
has a much smaller goat population. The Federal Food Safety Agency
says 2 Belgian farms have been infected.

According to the FASFC, the Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food
Chain, 2 farms have goats that are infected with Q fever: one in
Flanders and one in Wallonia. Federal Health Minister Laurette
Onkelinckx does not think the situation warrants extra measures here.
This year [2009], there have been 36 cases of people contracting Q
fever in Belgium (mostly in Flanders).

Q fever is a rare bacterial disease that can't be spread between
people and usually causes only flu-like symptoms. Many animals can
carry the bacteria, but contact with infected goats is believed to be
the main source of human infections. Most humans are infected between
February and May, when goats and sheep give birth.

Flanders is planning to take some general measures. Following a
meeting on Thursday [10 Dec 2009] between the government, farm
organisations and the union of goat farmers, Flemish Prime Minister
Kris Peeters stressed that the situation in Belgium is under control.
However, it was decided that the situation would be monitored more
closely. It was also decided to speed up work on the new vaccination
now in the making.

"It was agreed that the vaccination will be prepared as soon as
possible and in sufficient quantities," said PM Peeters. The
vaccination must be prepared before the next birthing period.

It was also decided to keep in close contact with the Dutch
authorities regarding the evolution of Q fever. Transport of goats or
equipment used for goats and goats' milk between the Netherlands and
Flanders will also be monitored very closely.

[Belgium's swift reaction to the recent detection of Q fever
infection in local goat farms is plausible, in view of the alarming
news from neighbouring Netherlands. However, it remains to be seen if
the Belgian findings indicate a new development or that they just
reflect enhanced alertness with subsequent intensified testing. _C.
burnetti_ is regarded to be present in most if not all countries
around the globe. According to Belgium's reports to the OIE, no Q
fever outbreaks have been recorded there during the years 2005-2008.
However, Belgium does not claim that the disease has never occurred;
the last year of Q fever occurrence in Belgium is claimed to be
"unknown". It will be interesting to note whether Q fever was
included in serological surveillance in Belgium in the past,
involving cattle, sheep and goats.

Are the new findings to be regarded as an "emerging disease?" If
affirmative, an OIE report is due.

Subscribers interested in detailed, updated information on the
developments in the Netherlands and the recent changes in the Dutch Q
fever control measures are referred to the 9 Dec 2009 explanatory
letter to the Dutch parliament by the ministers of Health and
Agriculture, available (in Dutch) at
<http://www.minlnv.nl/portal/page?_pageid=116,1640321&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL&p_file_id=46903>.

Recent media reports from the Netherlands may give the wrong
impression that Q fever is exclusively related to goats as animal
reservoirs of infection. Infection in other species, particularly
sheep, should not to be neglected. Reportedly, during 2008, Q-fever
outbreaks were diagnosed in the Netherlands on 7 dairy-goat farms and
one dairy-sheep farm. Further data, including a map (slide 5) showing
the high prevalence of Q-fever in sheep and goat farms during 2008,
can be seen in the May 2009 Dutch presentation available at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/q_fever0506052009.pdf>.

2009's detailed, updated information on the Q fever situation in
Dutch animals will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
