Vets have found signs the midgeborne Schmallenberg virus (SBV), which is capable of causing deformities in calves and lambs, was circulating in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, in autumn 2017.

The results have been revealed by SAC Consulting Veterinary Services (part of Scotland's Rural College), which -- in conjunction with Livestock Health Scotland with funding from the Scottish Government -- has been monitoring bulk milk samples from 50 dairy herds across the country throughout autumn.

First entering the UK on wind flows from Europe in 2011, SBV is spread by midges and affects both cattle and sheep. Initial infection can cause general symptoms of reduced appetite, a raised temperature, milk drop and scour. Some acute infections can be hard to detect -- particularly in cattle and sheep at grass.

When cattle and sheep are infected in the earlier stages of pregnancy, infection of the fetus may lead to skeletal deformities in the lambs and calves once born. Cases like this were 1st seen in southern Scotland in 2013, but the disease's profile fell in the following seasons.

In 2017, SAC Consulting's Veterinary Surveillance Network identified fetal deformities caused by SBV in southern Scotland and northern England. Cases were seen initially in lambs from mid-January 2017 and the last case was confirmed in early May [2017]. These dates suggest a potential infection window between mid-September and mid-December 2016.

George Caldow, head of SAC Consulting, said: "Each farm acts only as sentinel to SBV activity in the local area and circumstances vary from farm to farm with regard to virus spread and midge activity. The results of the study so far can, therefore, only act as a guide, but do suggest there has been some active transmission of SBV in Dumfries and Galloway in the autumn of 2017. This could potentially lead to the birth of deformed lambs and calves. However, in other areas of the country - particularly north of the Central Belt - we expect the disease risk to be much lower. Farmers concerned about potential SBV risk should speak to their vets in the 1st instance."

[Schmallenberg virus (SBV), an orthobunyavirus discovered in European livestock in late 2011 for the 1st time, causes a vectorborne disease in cattle and sheep. Its main effects in pregnant animals are abortions, premature or stillbirth, and severe fetal malformations; see references.

Following reemergence of SBV in the Netherlands and Germany in late 2014, and its apparent absence in Europe during 2015, reemergence of this teratogenic culicoides-borne virus was reported from the Netherlands and Germany in October 2016. At the same time or shortly thereafter, SBV renewed its circulation in Wales and the west of England. The dynamics of its overwintering mechanism are still in need of research.

According to accumulated information, it is very unlikely that SBV poses a risk to humans.

The laboratory results of samples from cattle in Dumfries and Galloway in the autumn of 2017 are indicative of a history of SBV circulation in the herds.

SBV may cause some abortions; its main effect is upon embryos surviving infection during certain stages of their development. The damage, if caused, becomes obvious when such foeti conclude their gestation period. Infection in susceptible cattle during early pregnancy may cause foeti death and/or -- in surviving foeti -- CNS damage (mainly hydranencephaly). SBV infection during later stages of pregnancy is expected to cause mainly arthrogryposis.

Though only cattle were sampled, it may be assumed that sheep were infected as well. In case their infection took place while already pregnant, their offspring may have been affected similarly to cattle.
