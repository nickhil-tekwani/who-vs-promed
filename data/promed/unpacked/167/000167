Nodding disease mostly afflicts children. It's called nodding disease because those who have it have a strange pendulous nodding of the head, especially when they are trying to eat certain foods or when they get cold. They also have an inability to eat and are affected by malnutrition. Nodding disease could be a systemic necrotizing vasculitis due to a mycosis infection.

The pathogen here specifically could be to be _Claviceps africana_, also called sorghum rot or sorghum ergot. Sorghum is a type of grain that is grown widely in the regions of Africa affected by the nodding disease.

Nodding disease in children develops from eating infected sorghum cereal and simply breathing the spores downwind from sorghum fields. Sorghum ergot fungi cause symptoms in animals that are similar to symptoms in children who have the nodding disease [see for instance: Blaney BJ et al. Sorghum ergot (_Claviceps africana_) associated with agalactia and feed refusal in pigs and dairy cattle. Aust Vet J. 2000;78:102-7].

Many children who have the nodding disease have stunted growth and mental retardation and other symptoms. These symptoms are very similar to ergot mold poisoning in rye.

Cattle and pigs that have eaten ergot-infected sorghum suffer from the same refusal to eat and from the same severe hypothermia experienced by children with the nodding disease.

[Food toxins have been mentioned before, but not sorghum rot as the specific course. So far, data from analysis of mycotoxins have not been released to the public. Recent reviews of mycotoxins include: Richard JL. Some major mycotoxins and their mycotoxicoses--an overview. Int J Food Microbiol. 2007;119:3-10; and Bennett JW, Klich M. Mycotoxins. Clin Microbiol Rev. 2003;16:497-516.

The suggestion that nodding disease could be a systemic vasculitis is contradicted by the normal finding in the cerebral fluid and inconsistent changes seen on MRI. - Mod.EP]
