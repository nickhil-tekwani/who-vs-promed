The [Thai] Disease Control Department [DCD] has warned parents of new hand, foot and mouth disease [HFMD] outbreaks, which are set to spread during the upcoming rainy season. HFMD outbreaks occur all year round but the largest number of cases is reported during the rainy season. In March and April 2014 alone, the rate of infection was nearly twice as high as that reported during the same period last year [2013]. It is expected that from May onwards, the number of HFMD cases could jump to as high as 5500, especially during the peak month of July.

Since the beginning of this year [2014], almost 14 000 cases have been reported, equivalent to a rate of 21.5 cases per 100 000 population. However, no deaths have been reported so far. Most HFMD cases were found in Mae Hong Son and Phetchaburi.

HFMD is a common viral illness that usually affects infants and children younger than 5 years old. Symptoms of the disease include fever, blister-like sores in the mouth, and a skin rash. There is no vaccine to protect against the viruses that cause HFMD. But children can lower their risk of being infected by often washing hands with soap and water and avoiding close contact with people with HFMD.

[Although no commercial EV71 vaccine is yet available, a recent publication suggests a vaccine may be in the offing (Li R, Liu L, Mo Z, et al. An inactivated Enterovirus 71 vaccine in healthy children. N Engl J Med 2014; 370(9): 829-37). The abstract is shown below:

"We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial involving healthy children 6 to 71 months of age in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China. 2 doses of an inactivated EV71 vaccine or placebo were administered intramuscularly, with a 4-week interval between doses, and children were monitored for up to 11 months. The primary end point was protection against hand, foot, and mouth disease caused by EV71.

"A total of 12 000 children were randomly assigned to receive vaccine or placebo. Serum neutralizing antibodies were assessed in 549 children who received the vaccine. The seroconversion rate was 100 per cent 4 weeks after the 2 vaccinations, with a geometric mean titer of 170.6. Over the course of 2 epidemic seasons, the vaccine efficacy was 97.4 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval [CI], 92.9 to 99.0) according to the intention-to-treat analysis and 97.3 per cent (95 per cent CI, 92.6 to 99.0) according to the per-protocol analysis. Adverse events, such as fever (which occurred in 41.6 per cent of the participants who received vaccine vs. 35.2 per cent of those who received placebo), were significantly more common in the week after vaccination among children who received the vaccine than among those who received placebo." - Mod.LL
