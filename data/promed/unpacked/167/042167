October is the beginning of small game hunting season in Colorado. As the number of human tularemia cases in our state continues to rise, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment reminds small game hunters to "hunt healthy" in 2014.

"We haven't seen this many tularemia cases in Colorado since the 1980s," said State Public Health Veterinarian Dr. Jennifer House. "Historically, we see cases of tularemia in hunters, and the disease is so widespread in 2014, we want to make sure our hunters understand the risks."

"In the last 10 years Colorado has averaged 3 human cases of tularemia a year," Dr. House said. "So far in 2014 we have had 11, and additional suspected cases are under investigation."

Local health departments have received numerous reports of rabbit and rodent die-offs across the state in 2014. Animals from 12 counties tested positive for tularemia, a bacterial disease that can affect small game animals. It commonly causes illness and death in rabbits and rodents such as squirrels. People can get tularemia if they handle infected animals or are bitten by ticks or deer flies.

People also can be exposed to tularemia by touching contaminated soil, drinking contaminated water or inhaling bacteria. Hunters are most at risk when skinning game and preparing and consuming the meat.

Hunters should:
- Harvest only small game that looks and acts healthy. Beware of lazy rabbits!
- Avoid hunting in areas where dead small game has been found.
- Wear gloves when handling small game animals, and wash your hands after removing your gloves.
- Cook all game meat thoroughly to 160-170 F.
- Notify your public health department or local wildlife office if you notice sick or dead rabbits or rodents.
- Symptoms of tularemia include abrupt onset of fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, joint pain, vomiting, dry cough and difficulty breathing. Other symptoms are skin ulcers, swollen and painful lymph glands, inflamed eyes, sore throat, mouth sores, diarrhea or pneumonia. Tularemia often is overlooked as a diagnosis because it is rare, and the symptoms are similar to other diseases. 9/11 people infected with tularemia this year were hospitalized for treatment.
- Anyone who becomes ill after exposure to a sick or dead animal, or after spending time in areas where sick or dead wild animals have been seen, should talk to a health care provider about the possibility of tularemia.
- Tularemia is treatable with antibiotics.

[Tularemia is typically found in animals, especially small mammals such as voles, mice, rodents, rabbits, and hares. [The bacterium] _Francisella tularensis_ is found in a wide range of animal hosts and is capable of surviving for weeks at low temperatures in water, moist soil, or decaying plant and animal matter.

Although hundreds of differing vertebrates and invertebrates can be infected with the tularemia bacillus, no more than a dozen or so are important in its ecology. Humans become infected through a variety of mechanisms including bites of infected arthropods (mosquitoes, ticks, deerflies), handling infected or dead animals, ingesting contaminated food or water, and inhaling aerosols of bacteria.

The type of exposure will dictate the form of the disease manifestation with cutaneous exposures usually resulting in the glandular or ulceroglandular forms. The type of disease in these cases is not stated. - Mod.LL
