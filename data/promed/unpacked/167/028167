[This official report to OIE by the Armenian officials fills out the details missing from the earlier press reports. All in all, in Gegharkunik 8 out of the 10 susceptible animals died with 2 of 2 sheep, and 7 of 8 cattle. There were probably some sick sheep that were missed and fortunately survived. The human & livestock cases in Shirak have yet to be reported by OIE. A typical rural situation where the herds & flocks in a village mainly consist of a few animals each. And remember that when a disease is truly sporadic the odd acute death can be overlooked and not reported, being put down to bad luck. Here once a case was noted and reported, it alerted the communities involved to be on the watch for further cases. Plus, we had 6 owners with obvious cutaneous infections.

Our thanks to Cristina for forwarding this OIE report. - Mod.MHJ
