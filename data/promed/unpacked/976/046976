[From a previous ProMED-mail post (reference below): "Although
wildlife health officials have yet to conduct tests on the dead
birds, they suspect that some of the deaths were caused by avian
chlamydiosis."]
Just a footnote. Chlamydiosis in birds is often a secondary
infection. The disease agent is opportunistic. Usually the bird's
health is already weakened due to some other condition. The bacteria
that causes chlamydiosis is ever-present in the bird population, but
often not "active." When something weakens the bird's resistance,
the organism will then take hold.
It might also be something else in the environment that is weakening
the birds, leaving them susceptible to chlamydia.
