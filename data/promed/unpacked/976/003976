There is some confusion about the number of recent deaths due to
meningococcal meningitis in Porto Seguro as reported in the 3 news releases
above.

The 3rd news release states that the deaths have been attributed to
meningococcal serogroup C. Outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis in Brazil
in the past have been both B and C (see ProMED-mail posting Meningitis,
meningococcal - Brazil 19960125.0182).

The 3rd news release also states that Bahia has experienced an increased
number of cases of meningitis this year (2009). We request more information
on this apparently ongoing outbreak of meningococcal meningitis in Bahia.

The Brazilian state of Bahia, in the north eastern part of the country, on
the Atlantic coast, can be seen on the map at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/brazil.jpg>. Porto Seguro is a
municipality in the southern part of the state with a population in 2006 of
140 000. It is located 707 km (440 mi) south of Salvador, the state
capital, and can be seen on the maps at
