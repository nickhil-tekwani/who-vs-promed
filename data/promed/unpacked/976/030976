The Russian veterinary services have reported outbreaks of classical
swine fever (CSF) to the Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).
Outbreaks were recorded in game husbandry (Znamenskoye) in Ugransky,
Smolenskaya Oblast, located west of Moscow near the border with
Belarus. The disease was found in 9 wild boars.

Apart from CSF, Russia reports ongoing outbreaks of African swine
fever [ASF]. Both diseases are similar in name and clinical signs but
have a different viral origin.
