Mystery disease claims 8 lives in Dadeldhura
--------------------------------------------
At least 8 people have died of an unknown disease in a single VDC in the
far-western district of Dadeldhura.
Several dozen people in Belapur VDC have been infected with the disease
over the last 2 weeks, reports said. The disease has symptoms like severe
headache, fever, and cough. Eight deaths have so far been confirmed in the VDC.
More than 500 others have been infected with the mystery disease in
Siddhapur, Sikash, and Dhungadh VDCs of the same district. Proper health
services are not available in these areas, reports added.
No medical team has yet reached the affected areas from the District Health
Office.

[From the description of the illness, a febrile respiratory illness,
influenza is high on the list of probable diagnoses, both in Nepal as
anywhere else in the world. But that being said, clearly more information
on the outbreak is necessary before coming to any conclusions.
Borrowing from a moderator note in a prior posting on an undiagnosed
outbreak in Nepal: "As one can see from the see also list below,
ProMED-mail reports of undiagnosed illnesses and deaths in Nepal have not
been rare. Unfortunately, what has been rare is for ProMED-mail to receive
information from knowledgeable sources in Nepal on results of epidemiologic
and laboratory investigations into these reported outbreaks and clusters."
As always, we are hoping that knowledgeable sources (either Nepal-based or
organizations that have knowledgeable sources in Nepal) might shed some
light on the above mentioned fatal febrile respiratory disease.

in the western part of Nepal not far from the border with India can be
