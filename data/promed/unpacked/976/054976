The Departmental Health Service (SEDES) of La Paz reported that an 81-year-old woman in the municipality of Apolo, north of La Paz, died on 26 Feb 2018, due to bubonic plague, confirming the 1st case of this type of disease in 2018. The head of the Epidemiology Unit of that health division, Alejandra Salas, indicated that the positive case was confirmed after a laboratory examination that led to the activation of an operation in the area, in order to interrupt the chain of transmission. "They proceeded to perform the active search for rodents that were near the houses, because these animals are usually those that have fleas and through their bite the bubonic plague is transmitted," Salas said, according to an institutional note.

The health contingent evaluated homes in the communities of Machua, Los Altos, Alto Humaca, and Suturi, where they also trained residents on the symptoms of the disease, its consequences and how to disinfect vulnerable areas with insecticides.

[_Yersinia pestis_ is endemic in parts of South America including the La Paz department of Bolivia.

Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a "bubo." Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, as appears to have happened in the report above, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of "primary" plague pneumonia. - Mod.LL
