Contained within the article was the following statement:
"If you do find a tick on your pet you can remove it with a pair of tweezers and turning counter clockwise as you pull."

Not so, the tweezers should be used on the tick as close to the patient's skin as possible and then the tick should be pulled straight back.

[I appreciate my sharp-eyed readers. ProMED-mail does not endorse an incorrect measure of removing ticks from animals. Pulling straight back, not twisting the tick, is a much better technique and will likely result in the removal of the whole tick, rather than a portion of the tick.

There were a number of readers writing with the same suggestion. I thank you all. - Mod.TG]
