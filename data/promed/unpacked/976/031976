Test results from the final chronic wasting disease (CWD) surveillance samples sent after the close of Montana's general hunting season showed 4 more deer along the Hi-Line to be positive for CWD. Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks (FWP) said in a press release on Friday [14 Dec 2018] that the 4 deer included a mule deer buck from Hill County and a white-tailed buck from Phillips County. Both deer were taken in areas with previous detections.

Additionally, 2 mule deer bucks from Sheridan County also tested positive. These are the 1st from Sheridan County. This brings the total number of positive animals found in this year's [2018] surveillance to 26 deer -- 5 from the CWD-positive area south of Billings and 21 from along the Hi-Line.

In the coming weeks, FWP officials will look back at this year's [2018] surveillance effort along the northern part of the state and determine the next steps forward in addressing CWD, including any management actions. CWD surveillance efforts will continue next year [2019] in portions of southeast Montana in FWP Region 7.

Hunters should properly dispose of carcasses. Once an animal with CWD dies, any part of the carcass can transmit the disease for at least 2 years. Safely disposing of all animal parts in solid waste landfills will help prevent the transmission of CWD.

For more information on CWD in Montana, go to <fwp.mt.gov/CWD>.

[The old adage of "seek and you will find" seems to be paying off with the surveillance of hunter-killed cervids. This report does indicate a spread of disease, as there were 2 positive animals in a new county, Sheridan County. I wish we knew how many animals taken vs the number of positive animals to make some calculation regarding the percentage of positive animals. - Mod.TG
