The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has recently detected higher than usual rates of liver inflammation (hepatitis) in children. Similar cases are being assessed in Scotland. Hepatitis is a condition that affects the liver and may occur for a number of reasons, including several viral infections common in children. However, in the cases under investigation the common viruses that cause hepatitis have not been detected.

UKHSA is working swiftly with the NHS and public health colleagues across the UK to investigate the potential cause. In England, about 60 cases are under investigation in children under 10.

Dr Meera Chand, director of clinical and emerging infections, said: "Investigations for a wide range of potential causes are under way, including any possible links to infectious diseases. We are working with partners to raise awareness among healthcare professionals, so that any further children who may be affected can be identified early and the appropriate tests carried out. This will also help us to build a better picture of what may be causing the cases. We are also reminding parents to be aware of the symptoms of jaundice -- including skin with a yellow tinge which is most easily seen in the whites of the eyes -- and to contact a healthcare professional if they have concerns."

Hepatitis symptoms include:
- dark urine;
- pale, grey-colored stool;
- Iichy skin;
- yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice);
- muscle and joint pain;
- feeling and being sick;
- feeling unusually tired all the time;
- loss of appetite; and
- abdominal pain.

An investigation is under way following reports of a number of cases of hepatitis in young children across central Scotland. Public Heath Scotland (PHS) is investigating the cause of a small number of cases of hepatitis (liver inflammation). It is aware of 11 cases of hepatitis requiring admission to hospital that have been identified in children aged between 1 and 5 years old in 4 NHS Health Board areas in Scotland (Lanarkshire, Tayside, GGC and Fife). Most cases have presented from March [2022]. The hepatitis viruses commonly associated with this condition have been excluded.

Each year around 7 or 8 cases of non A to E hepatitis (without other underlying diagnoses) are detected in children in Scotland. The number of cases in such a short period of time, combined with the geographical spread and severity of illness, in some cases, is unusual and requires further investigation. As yet, there is no clear connection between the cases and, at present, there is no clear cause. All potential causes are being explored, but infection is considered to be a more probable source this time.

Investigations are still in the early stages and work is ongoing with partners and other agencies across the UK to investigate these cases. Dr Nicholas Phin, director of public health for Public Health Scotland, said: "If you have a child who is showing signs of jaundice, where the skin has a yellow tinge and is most easily seen in the whites of the eyes, then parents should contact their GP or other healthcare professional. We are continuing to investigate these cases and will provide further updates as and when they are available."

[Of the 5 classical causes of viral hepatitis, B, C and D are basically spread by blood or body fluid exposure, which has not been reported here, leaving types A and E, which are food or water transmitted primarily. The above posts state that these appear to have been ruled out by testing, although antibody assays for hepatitis E virus can be false-negative. In Europe and North America, where yellow fever or other hemorrhagic fevers are not endemic, agents such as Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus and leptospirosis, among many others, can cause hepatitis but usually in conjunction with other signs and symptoms outside the liver. Chemical poisoning in foods or drinks bears consideration, or adulteration of other products could have occurred. It is not clear how many of the cases were icteric. If this was prominent, that is uncommon in viral hepatitis in children.

ProMED awaits more information regarding this evolving outbreak. It would be interesting to know if siblings of the cases, presumably eating and drinking the same things, were biochemically examined to assess whether there was elevation in the aminotransferase enzymes in the blood (AST, ALT), which is found in hepatitis even without jaundice. - Mod.LL
