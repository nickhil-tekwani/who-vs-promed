Wisconsin has recorded another case of eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] this year [2016]. State animal health officials say a horse from Wood County has tested positive for the disease, bringing the total number of EEE cases in Wisconsin to over a dozen.

EEE is caused by a virus transmitted by mosquitoes, and may cause encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain, and is fatal to horses in 90 per cent of cases. Symptoms in horses include depression, appetite loss, drooping eyelids and lower lip, fever, weakness, twitching, paralysis or lack of coordination, aimless wandering, circling, and blindness. The virus is not contagious between horses, but can be carried by mosquitoes from an avian, or bird, host to horses and humans.

Other EEE cases have been confirmed in Forest, Lincoln, Clark, Langlade, and Waupaca Counties.

The state health department says no EEE cases in humans have been reported in Wisconsin since 2011, which was only the 2nd case known to have occurred since 1984.

[The present extended summer weather has extended the mosquito season far into the fall (autumn), beyond the dates when we would have normally expected the 1st frosts in Wisconsin, a northern state.
