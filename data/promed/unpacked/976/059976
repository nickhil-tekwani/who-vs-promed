Food poisoning has sickened 206 NATO soldiers who ate in a German army
canteen at Mazar-i-Sharif in northern Afghanistan, defense authorities
in Berlin said Thursday, 13 Oct 2011. They said the 138 Germans and 68
military from other nations quickly had quickly recovered from the
symptoms and overall fighting strength was not affected. All had eaten
Wednesday, 12 Oct 2011, at the canteen in the ISAF regional
headquarters in Mazar-i-Sharif. The kitchen was disinfected and
preparation of meals resumed there on Thursday, 13 Oct 2011. Army
scientists were still hunting for the source of the infection.

[The specific gastrointestinal symptoms which developed in the NATO
troops are not stated but the quick recovery suggests a preformed
toxin-type illness such as staphylococcal food poisoning.

The following information regarding this entity is extracted from the
USA FDA's Bad Bug Book http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/chap3.html:

In the diagnosis of staphylococcal foodborne illness, proper
interviews with the victims, and the gathering and analyzing of
epidemiological data, are essential. Incriminated foods should be
collected and examined for staphylococci. The presence of relatively
large numbers of enterotoxigenic staphylococci is good circumstantial
evidence that the food contains toxin. The most conclusive test is the
linking of an illness with a specific food, or, in cases where
multiple vehicles exist, the detection of the toxin in the food
sample(s).

In cases where the food may have been treated to kill the
staphylococci, as in pasteurization or heating, direct microscopic
observation of the food may be an aid in the diagnosis. A number of
serological methods for determining the enterotoxigenicity of _S.
aureus_ isolated from foods, as well as methods for the separation and
detection of toxins in foods, have been developed, and used
successfully, to aid in the diagnosis of the illness. Phage typing may
also be useful when viable staphylococci can be isolated from the
incriminated food, from victims, and from suspected carriers, such as
food handlers.

A toxin dose of less than 1.0 microgram in contaminated food will
produce symptoms of staphylococcal intoxication. This toxin level is
reached when _S. aureus_ populations exceed 100 000 per gram.

Foods that are frequently incriminated in staphylococcal food
poisoning include meat and meat products; poultry and egg products;
salads such as egg, tuna, chicken, potato, and macaroni; bakery
products such as cream-filled pastries, cream pies, and chocolate
eclairs; sandwich fillings; and milk and dairy products. Foods that
require considerable handling during preparation, and that are kept at
slightly elevated temperatures after preparation, are frequently
involved in staphylococcal food poisoning. - Mod.LL]
