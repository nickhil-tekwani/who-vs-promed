New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Ndiakhat, Pout, Thies
Date of start of the outbreak: 23 Dec 2020
Outbreak status: Resolved on 7 Jan 2021
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Birds / 100 000 / 58 000 / 58 000 / 42 000 / 0

Affected population: Layers whose age range is between [9-18] months and [18-24] months. Poultry are kept in closed buildings with an automatic feed and water supply system. The poultry farm is located away from households.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds / 58 / 58 / 100 / 100
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: The disease was detected by the farm manager on 23 Dec 2020, through a drop in water consumption and the recording of high fatalities. The morbidity and mortality rates are 58% and the lethality rate is 100%. The main clinical signs observed are oedema, cyanosis, congestion of the crests and barbs and prostration.

Control measures
Measures applied: Movement control inside the country; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; quarantine; official destruction of animals products; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; stamping out; control of wildlife reservoirs; disinfection; process to inactivate the pathogenic agent in products or by-products; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: Traceability

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Dakar National Laboratory for Livestock and Veterinary Research (LNERV) (national laboratory) / Birds / Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 30 Dec 2021 / Positive
Dakar National Laboratory for Livestock and Veterinary Research (LNERV) (national laboratory) / Birds / RRT-PCR / 30 Dec 2021 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[This is the 1st time that Senegal reports highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). HPAI subtype H5N1 is endemic in some countries of the African continent.

The following information comes from a scientific article titled "Evolution of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus in Poultry, Togo, 2018," published December 2019 in the Emerging Infectious Diseases journal by the CDC:

"In 2015, highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses reemerged in poultry in West Africa. We describe the introduction of a reassortant clade 2.3.2.1c virus into Togo in April 2018. Our findings signal further local spread and evolution of these viruses, which could affect animal and human health.

"Relatively little is known about the emergence, prevalence, and circulation of animal influenza viruses in Africa. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 clade 2.2 viruses emerged in Africa in 2006 (cases were reported from Egypt, Nigeria, Cote d'Ivoire, Benin, Togo, Ghana, Sudan, Djibouti, and Cameroon), although the virus was only maintained long term in Egypt. We conducted surveillance in domestic poultry in Cote d'Ivoire, Benin, and Togo during 2008-2010 but were unable to find virologic or serologic evidence for influenza A virus circulation. Several factors, such as type of hosts, climate, and animal density, might have provided unfavorable conditions for the virus' circulation in the region.

"In early 2015, HPAI H5N1 viruses of clade 2.3.2.1c were reported in Nigeria, followed closely by detections in Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Niger, Cameroon, and Togo. These viruses could be clustered into 2 genetic subgroups; cluster WA1 viruses were detected in Ghana, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria, and Niger, and cluster WA2 viruses were detected in Niger, Cote d'Ivoire, and Nigeria. In this study, we aimed to determine the origin and evolution of HPAI A(H5N1) viruses responsible for poultry outbreaks in Togo in April 2018 in the context of viruses from surrounding countries."
