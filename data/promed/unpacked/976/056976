With the addition of 7 suspected Rift Valley fever (RVF) cases reported from Yirol East County, South Sudan, 20 suspect cases have been reported in the past month.

Of the cases, 3 are confirmed and 3 probable cases who died and had epidemiological links to the confirmed cases.

On 28 Dec 2017, the Ministry of Health of South Sudan reported a cluster of 3 severe hemorrhagic cases, which were epidemiologically linked by place (all occurred in Thonabutkok village, Yirol East County) and time (all in December 2017). Goats, sheep, and cattle in the area also showed evidence of zoonotic hemorrhagic illness.

On 19 Jan 2018, a joint Ministry of Health/WHO rapid response team arrived in Yirol East and have investigated the 2 most recent suspect cases, collected and shipped samples to Uganda Viral Research Institute (UVRI) for testing, and discussed the establishment of a mechanism for case investigation and sample collection with the State Minister of Health and partners. They also trained teams in active case finding and trained 15 local healthcare workers in RVF case management.

[Of the 7 human and 7 animal samples, 3 from humans tested serologically positive for Rift Valley fever (RVF), and one animal sample was positive. In that locality, one goat and one sheep aborted, 8 goats died, and one cow was ill (http://who.int/hac/crises/ssd/figures/south-sudan-rvf-21january2017.pdf).

In an RVF outbreak, abortions and deaths in small ruminant animals are common. People can become infected by handling abortuses, carcasses, or blood of infected animals, or by bite of infected mosquitoes. Animal handlers, butchers and veterinarians are at particular risk of infection by RVF virus.

There have been undiagnosed cases of hemorrhagic disease in South Sudan several times before. In 2016, there was an outbreak of hemorrhagic disease. Unfortunately, despite the efforts of several reference laboratories, the etiological agent of that South Sudan hemorrhagic fever outbreak was not determined. In that outbreak, several possible viruses were discarded by laboratory tests (see Undiagnosed hemorrhagic illness - South Sudan (02): addtl. information 20160625.4309572). In 1999, an outbreak of hemorrhagic disease in humans occurred in the southern part of Sudan due to infections with the bacterium _Borrelia recurrentis_, the cause of louse-borne relapsing fever.
