Saudi Health Ministry urges public to take proper precautions around camels
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
With hajj approaching [sometime between 2-7 Oct 2014], the Ministry of Health [MOH] reminds the public of the need to take precautions when dealing with camels because of the risk of contracting [Middle East respiratory syndrome] coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

Strict implementation of standard infection control measures led to dramatic decline in the number of healthcare-associated infections. Sporadic cases are expected to continue to occur as a result of exposure to secretions from camels that carry the virus without wearing a mask, gloves or protective clothing. MOH urges the public not to become complacent about the need to take proper measures to prevent exposure to this virus. In addition to the risk that unprotected exposure poses to the individual, it can put the health of others at risk, including family members and healthcare workers.

Studies have shown that MERS-CoV can be found in the mucus and saliva of infected camels, and research conducted by Saudi scientists indicates that camels play a role in the transmission of this virus to humans.

MOH has advised workers to take precautions when they interact with camels in places in like barns and slaughterhouses. This includes wearing a protective mask and gloves, as well as coveralls.

[The above reminder/recommendation is important as the time approaches when millions of Muslims will travel to Saudi Arabia to perform their Hajj (pilgrimage) to the holy sites. Since 1 Jul 2014, transmission of MERS-CoV has slowed down significantly, with a total of 15 laboratory-confirmed cases during this period (through today, 13 Sep 2014), and 10 deaths attributable to MERS-CoV infection reported. Of these 15 cases, 4 (27 percent) were in healthcare workers, suggesting nosocomial spread, although information on risk exposures of the 15 cases was not available to rule out the possibility of sporadic cases related to possible high risk camel exposures.

[As recently underlined by the ECDC (posting 20140604.2518134), "a good understanding of MERS-CoV epidemiology of camels (such as seasonal calving periods and diarrheal outbreaks) is needed to fully assess the zoonotic risk. Many gaps remain in our knowledge of the epidemiology of coronavirus infections in dromedary camels, including exact contact patterns with humans, both in the population generally and in MERS cases."

Between October 2013 and September 2014 MERS-CoV was detected in camels in Kuwait (5), Qatar (4), Oman (5) and UAE (1). Consequently they reported their observations to the OIE. In October 2012 it was detected in a bat in Saudi Arabia. It was detected also in milk samples in Qatar.

In spite of the fact that the vast majority of human cases (and deaths) come from Saudi Arabia, there is, so far, no official report on MERS-CoV in camels in the country.

The measures announced, apparently based upon information on camel infection from other countries, are highly plausible. The lack of information on camels in Saudi Arabia deserves to be remedied the earliest. Preferably, measures should be based upon solid data on the role camels play -- how, where, when -- and the virus dynamics related to them. Such knowledge may require experimental infection trials in camels. - Mod.AS]
