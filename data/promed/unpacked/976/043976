Dear Dr Blancou
Newcastle disease in the Sydney Region, New South Wales
Further to my advice of 24 December 1999, I am reporting two separate
isolated cases of virulent Newcastle disease (ND) on two small, commercial
multi-age layer farms in western Sydney, within the previously described
Cumberland Surveillance Zone encompassing the Greater Sydney region.
The first farm is at Orchard Hills, approximately 45 km west of the Sydney
central business district. There are approximately 14 000 layers on this
farm. The second farm is at Llandilo, approximately 47 km west-north-west of
the Sydney central business district. There are approximately 8 500 layers
on this farm, which is approximately 10 km north of the farm at Orchard
Hills. Both farms supply table eggs to the Sydney metropolitan area.
There has been little overt disease in either flock, with very few (one or
two) pullets on each farm showing any clinical signs suggestive of ND. The
CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory at Geelong (AAHL), an OIE
reference laboratory for ND, has confirmed the presence of virulent ND virus
by demonstration of virulent sequence at the cleavage site of the fusion
gene by polymerase chain reaction on infected brain tissue. ND virus has
been isolated from the Orchard Hills flock but it has not yet been
sequenced. Virus has not been isolated from the Llandillo flock but
isolation attempts are continuing.
The infected farms have been quarantined and movement restrictions have been
imposed on poultry and products. Vaccination of the flocks within a
three-kilometre radius of each flock is being implemented.
I shall keep you informed of additional response measures as they are
implemented, and of results of continuing surveillance, laboratory and field
investigations, as soon as possible.
Kind regards
GARDNER MURRAY
Managing Director, National Offices, and
Australian Chief Veterinary Officer
