A swine die-off is registered in Mountainous Karabagh
-----------------------------------------------------
According to the information given by the head of food safety and
veterinary agency of Armenia, Grigori Bagyan, the specialists at the
Ministry of Agriculture are currently working to investigate the origin of
the outbreak [in Nagorno-Karabagh; see map at
<http://polosbastards.com/pb/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/azerbaijan%20map.jpg>.
- Mod.AS]

Grigori Bagyan does not exclude the possibility of African swine fever
[ASF] and said that the final answer will be available only after the test
results are obtained from the reference laboratory.

The specimens are planned to be sent to the UK; alternatively, they could
also be shipped to Russia. He also said that only one focus of infection
has been registered; measures are being taken to prevent the spread of the
infection.

Up to date, ASF has been recorded in Lori and Tavush regions of Armenia;
the epidemic has passed already and caused a slaughter of 6000 pigs. It has
been said that the virus came to Armenia from Georgia.
