Isingiro veterinary workers have started a massive vaccination of
cattle in the district to prevent foot and mouth disease [FMD]
rampant in Karagwe District.
[Karagwe is one of the 6 districts of the Kagera Region of northwest
Tanzania. It is bordered to the north by Uganda, to the east by the
Bukoba Rural District, to the southeast by the Muleba District, to
the south by the Ngara District and to the west by Rwanda, which is
divided by the River Kagera, map at

"We started vaccinating animals on Saturday [5 Jan 2008] with
Kashumba Sub-county because it borders Karagwe. The disease has not
crossed into Uganda, but it's at the border," Isingiro District
Veterinary officer Dr Bruhan Kasozi told journalists on Monday [7 Jan
2008]. He said the vaccination exercise would extend to other
Uganda-Tanzania border sub counties.
Dr Kasozi said there are worries that the bi-weekly cattle market at
Lyabatuura (in Tanzania, near Kashumba) could spread the disease.
Uganda cattle dealers, despite cross border cattle regulations, evade
law enforcers and cross with animals. The police will arrest such law
breakers if found.

[Confirmation from Tanzania's Veterinary Services, preferably by way
of an OIE notification, will be helpful.
According to the data published by the World FMD Reference Laboratory
at Pirbright, FMD is known to be endemic in Tanzania, the FMDV
serotypes present being O, SAT2, A, SAT1. (see at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/africa/tan.htm>).
However, no official reports to the OIE are available on the
organization's web-site. The report should include data on the FMDV
serotypes currently involved, species and age groups involved,
vaccination status, etc. - Mod.AS]
