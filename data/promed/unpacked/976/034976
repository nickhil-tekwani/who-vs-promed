On 17 May 2009, the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture announced that
the National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory had confirmed avian
influenza among migratory birds in Qinghai province. According to the
briefing, the regional veterinary departments in Gahai found dead
migratory birds on 8 May 2009. Specimens were collected and sent for
testing. On 12 May 2009, the Qinghai Provincial Animal Disease
Prevention and Control Center detected weak positive signals for
highly pathogenic avian influenza using RT-PCR. On 17 May 2009, the
birds were confirmed to be infected with highly pathogenic H5N1 avian
influenza by the National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory. As of
yesterday [17 May 2009], 121 wild birds had died.

In response to the outbreak, access to the affected area was
restricted for disinfection and culling of backyard poultry. All 121
dead wild birds and 600 culled poultry have been processed.

At present, there has been no disruption of life. No outbreak among
poultry has been found in Qinghai province.

[An official notification on the said outbreak has been sent to the
OIE by Dr Zhang Zhongqui, Deputy Director General, China Animal
Disease Control Centre, Veterinary Bureau, Beijing, PRC on 17 May
2009. According to the report, the measures to be applied are:
"Vaccination in response to the outbreak." See, with map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8107>.

Information on the species involved in this so-called "migratory
birds" event is anticipated. An extensive outbreak in wild geese and
other wild birds was observed in Qinghai exactly 4 years ago, in May
2005. It was followed by an outbreak in neighboring Xinjiang autonomous region.

Since the appearance of the novel A/H1N1 swine-related virus in the
international arena in April 2009, the highly pathogenic avian
influenza H5N1 virus has been put, unjustifiably but not
surprisingly, somewhat outside the public spotlights. Simultaneous
circulation of both viruses may lead to serious consequences,
particularly in countries with considerable pig populations, in case
co-infection of pigs with both viruses occur, potentially followed by
virus reassortments. These may, if the worse scenario materializes,
potentially combine the infectivity in humans of the novel H1N1 with
the high pathogenicity of HPAI H5N1. China has the potential to be
the site of such development, deserving close follow-up and
effective, immediate control measures. - Mod.AS]
