Red tide and food poisoning, Editorial [Excerpted
We are being advised anew to refrain from eating shellfish because the "red
tide" scourge has returned to Manila Bay. Most varieties of shellfish,
including crabs, are scavengers of the sea and are frequently infected with
coliform organisms popularly known as red tide.
The watchword is caution: look, taste or smell before you eat.

[Most ProMED-mail readers will note that "red tide" organisms are not
coliforms, but dinoflagellate algae that flourish during warm weather
conditions. Toxins produced by these organisms are concentrated by filter
feeders, especially shellfish. The toxins can be present in the tissues of
shellfish for some time following abatement of the "red tide". - Mods.JW/ES
