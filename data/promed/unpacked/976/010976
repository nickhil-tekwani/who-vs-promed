The NPPO of Sweden recently informed EPPO of the 1st finding of blueberry rust _Thekopsora minima_ (EPPO A2 List) on its territory. The rust was detected during official surveys conducted in October 2021 on _Vaccinium corymbosum_ grown in open air in the counties of Stockholm and Blekinge.

[Blueberry (leaf) rust can be caused by the fungus _Thekopsora minima_ or _Naohidemyces vaccinii_, depending on the region; a 3rd species, _N. fujisanensis_, is restricted to Japan. The disease affects a range of plants in the Ericaceae family, including _Vaccinium_ species with crops like blueberry, bilberry, and cranberry, as well as ornamentals such as rhododendrons and heathers. Symptoms may include yellow leaf spots on the upper surfaces of young leaves, followed by orange pustules developing on leaf undersides that release the spores. In severe cases or on highly susceptible cultivars, leaves turn brown and drop prematurely, resulting in serious defoliation and potentially death of the plant.

Rust spores are spread by wind over long distances and locally by splashing rain or mechanical means. Infected plant material, including fruit and budwood, poses a high risk of spreading the disease. The rusts can overwinter on evergreen blueberry leaves or alternative hosts in milder climates. Commercial highbush varieties are most susceptible. Disease management for rusts is extremely difficult and relies mainly on timely fungicide applications, choice of crop cultivars, phytosanitation, and control of pathogen reservoirs. Crop monitoring for early discovery of infection is important so action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogens as well as build-up of inoculum.
