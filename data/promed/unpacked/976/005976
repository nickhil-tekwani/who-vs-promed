Classical swine fever outbreak in North Rhine-Westphalia
--------------------------------------------------------
Classical swine fever has been identified on a farm in Haltern in the
German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. This was confirmed by the
Minister of the Environment, Uhlenberg, to the news channel ARD.
Haltern is about 60 km east of Winterswijk [The Netherlands].
[A map of North Rhine-Westphalia, including Haltern, bordering the province
Gelderland in the Netherlands, can be found at
<http://www.supertravelnet.com/maps/index.php?
action=showmap&country=164_9011_5&language=1>.]
Since the beginning of February 2006, 72 of the more than 300 pigs on
the farm in Haltern have died. After the diagnosis of classical swine
fever, all pigs in a radius of 3 km around the pig farm must be
killed. All pigs in a radius of 10 km around the farm must be checked
on a regular basis.
Uhlenberg said that 2 pig farms in the area of the affected farm have
been identified as suspect. However, it has not been confirmed
whether animals on those farms are infected with classical swine
fever.
The German Ministry of Agriculture did not state how the animals were
infected. At the end of last year [2005], the Product Boards for Livestock,
Meat and Eggs (PVE) in the Netherlands indicated their concern about the
possible infection of wild boars. Researchers had detected antibodies to
classical swine fever virus in wild boars in The Netherlands and Germany. This
meant that the animals [had been] ill, but no longer carried the virus.
Classical swine fever is not infectious for humans.

[During 1997-98, the Netherlands suffered a major CSF epizootic; the
disease was eradicated and has reportedly been absent since March
1998. Germany has reported the presence of CSF in wild boar only,
each year for the last 10 years; spillovers into commercial farms of
domestic pigs have been uncommon.
