Diseased bighorn sheep in cross hairs
-------------------------------------------
Wildlife officials charged with saving endangered peninsular bighorn sheep
near Palm Springs (California) are considering shooting some of the animals
to prevent a disease outbreak ravaging the herd.
One or 2 sheep may have to be killed for necropsy to identify the cause of
pneumonia that recently killed 7 animals in the Santa Rosa Mountains, says
Jane Hendron of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
Also, the service and the state Department of Fish and Game may use
sharpshooters to prevent sheep from crossing Highway 74, south of Palm
Desert, and infecting a larger herd, officials say. No final decision has
been made.
Walter Boyce, director of the UC Davis Wildlife Health Center, says the
die-off has claimed old and young sheep as well as animals reared in the
wild and in captivity.
"It's what we call an all-age die-off, which fits the picture of one of
those epidemics that has the potential to go through the entire herd,"
Boyce says.
The number of peninsular bighorn sheep plunged from 1200 in the late 1970s
to 280 in 1996, but the sheep have rebounded to about 705 animals today.
The herd is threatened by human encroachment, cougars, air pollution and
disease spread from livestock.

[According to this article, there are 7 dead animals of varying ages out of
a herd of approximately 700. In such an endangered herd, where the number
of animals in the herd equals the total population, 7 dead animals may be
considered a die-off. It is understandable to kill one or 2 animals to
determine the cause of illness, but the article does not indicate what they
plan to do once the cause is known.
There is a high probability that the pneumonia may be caused by
_Pasteurella_, as has happened in other bighorn sheep. - Mod.TG]
