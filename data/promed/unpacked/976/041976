Three people are feared dead in Musoli, Kakamega county after they reportedly feasted on infected meat. The cow is believed to have been infected with the deadly anthrax.

Reports from the village indicate the 3 men decided to skin the dead animal, oblivious of the danger it posed. One of them succumbed to death soon after skinning the animal and eating part of its meat. Those [others] who ate part of the meat are also in serious condition, with some reportedly having developed swollen hands and scars on their bodies.

Public Health Officer Josephat Matikho was at the scene in the morning inspecting the carcass to ascertain the disease that killed the cow.

Anthrax, the disease suspected to have led to the deaths of the 3 young men, is an acute disease caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_. Most forms of the disease are lethal, and it affects both humans and animals. When spores are inhaled, ingested, or come into contact with a skin lesion on a host, they may become reactivated and multiply rapidly.

[Back to 2005, I can find no reports of anthrax in humans or animals in Western Province, though it must exist there to have produced these cases. It is not high in public or veterinary awareness, and thus the price being paid by these 3 careless individuals. While the incubation period is usually from 3-4 days, enteric exposure to a high dose can kill in hours.
