Corporation, doing business as Long Phung Food Products.

Recall
------
- On [Tue 20 Nov 2018], 165368 C. Corporation, doing business as Long Phung Food Products in Houston, TX recalled ready-to-eat pork products because they might be contaminated with _Listeria_.
- Do not eat, sell, or serve recalled products from Long Phung Food Products.
The full list of recalled ready-to-eat pork patty rolls is on the USDA-FSIS website [https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts/recall-case-archive/archive/2018/recall-116-2018-release].
- Recalled products are labeled with establishment number "EST. 13561" inside the USDA mark of inspection.
- Recalled pork patty rolls were produced on various dates from [21 May 2018], through [16 Nov 2018]. These items were shipped to distributors and retail locations nationwide.

Advice
------
- Return any recalled pork products to the store for a refund or throw them away. Even if some of the product was eaten and no one got sick, do not eat it. If you do not know if the pork product you purchased was recalled, ask the place where you purchased it or throw it away.
- Wash and sanitize drawers or shelves in refrigerators and freezers where recalled pork products were stored. Follow the 5 steps [at https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/communication/clean-refrigerator-steps.html] to clean your refrigerator.
- Retailers should clean and sanitize deli slicers and other areas where recalled pork products were prepared, stored, or served. Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for sanitizer strength and application to ensure it is effective.
- If you develop symptoms of a _Listeria_ infection after eating recalled pork products, contact a healthcare provider and tell them you ate recalled pork products. This is especially important if you are pregnant, age 65 or older, or have a weakened immune system.

Latest outbreak information
---------------------------
- 4 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ have been reported from 4 states.
- _Listeria_ specimens from ill people were collected from [1 Jul 2017], to [24 Oct 2018].
- 4 people have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.
- Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicates that pork products from 165368 C. Corporation, doing business as Long Phung Food Products are a likely source of the outbreak.
- On [20 Nov 2018], 165368 C. Corporation, doing business as Long Phung Food Products recalled ready-to-eat pork products because they might be contaminated with _Listeria_.
- This investigation is ongoing, and CDC will provide updates when more information is available.

General _Listeria_ information
------------------------------
- If you have eaten recalled pork products and do not have any symptoms of a _Listeria_ infection, most experts believe that tests or treatment are not needed, even for people who have a higher chance of _Listeria_.
- In general, people who are at higher risk for _Listeria_ infection should not eat refrigerated pate or meat spreads from a deli or meat counter or from the refrigerated section of a store. Avoid eating hot dogs, lunch meats, cold cuts, other deli meats (such as bologna), or fermented or dry sausages unless they are heated to an internal temperature of 165 deg F [74 deg C] or until steaming hot just before serving.
- Foods that do not need refrigeration, like canned or shelf-stable pate and meat spreads, are safe to eat. Refrigerate these foods after opening.
- Learn more about how you can take steps to prevent _Listeria_ infection.

Symptoms of _Listeria_ infection
--------------------------------
- Listeriosis can cause a variety of symptoms, depending on the person and the part of the body affected.
- Pregnant women: pregnant women typically experience only fever and other flu-like symptoms, such as fatigue and muscle aches. However, infections during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, or life-threatening infection of the newborn.
- People other than pregnant women: symptoms can include headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions in addition to fever and muscle aches.
- People with invasive listeriosis usually report symptoms starting 1 to 4 weeks after eating food contaminated with _Listeria_; some people have reported symptoms starting as late as 70 days after exposure or as early as the same day of exposure. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics.
- Pregnant women and their newborns, adults age 65 and older, and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to get sick with listeriosis.

Investigation details
---------------------
21 Nov 2018
-----------
CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) are investigating a multistate outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infections.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on _Listeria_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using a technique called whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. WGS performed on bacteria isolated from ill people showed that they were closely relatedly genetically. This means that people in this outbreak are more likely to share a common source of infection.

As of [20 Nov 2018], 4 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ have been reported from four states. A list of the states and the number of cases in each can be found on the Map of Reported Cases page [at https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/porkproducts-11-18/map.html].

_Listeria_ specimens from ill people were collected from [1 Jul 2017 to 24 Oct 2018]. Ill people range in age from 35 to 84 years, with a median age of 60 years. All 4 ill people are female, and all 4 ill people were hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Illnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 10 weeks. Please see the Timeline for Reporting Cases of _Listeria_ Infection for more details.

Investigation of the outbreak
-------------------------------------
Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicates that pork products from 165368 C. Corporation, doing business as Long Phung Food Products in Houston, TX is a likely source of this outbreak.

In interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the 4 weeks before they became ill. 4 people were interviewed and all 4 reported eating Asian-style foods. 3 ill people reported shopping at stores where Long Phung Food Products are sold.

Whole genome sequencing results of samples collected at the Long Phung Food Products facility showed that _Listeria_ identified in the facility was closely related genetically to _Listeria_ from ill people. These results provide more evidence that ill people became sick from eating contaminated pork products.

On [20 Nov 2018], 165368 C. Corporation, doing business as Long Phung Food Products recalled ready-to-eat pork products (https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts/recall-case-archive/archive/2018/recall-116-2018-release) because they might be contaminated with _Listeria_ bacteria. Recalled pork products were produced from [21 May 2018], through [16 Nov 2018]. Consumers should return them to the store for a refund or throw them away. Restaurants and retailers should not serve or sell recalled Long Phung Food products.

This investigation is ongoing, and CDC will provide updates when more information is available.

[_Listeria_-contaminated, refrigerated ready-to eat products that do not require further cooking before eating, such as smoked salmon or cold cut meats, like ham or pork, are well-recognized sources for listeriosis, due to the fact that _Listeria_ is able to multiply at refrigerator temperatures.

An epidemiologic investigation has identified 4 confirmed cases of listeriosis, in 4 states linked to ready-to-eat pork patties. Whole genome sequencing results of samples collected at the Long Phung Food Products facility showed that _Listeria_ identified in the facility was closely related genetically to _Listeria_ isolated from the ill people. On 20 Nov 2018, 165368 C. Corporation, doing business as Long Phung Food Products recalled ready-to-eat pork products. New cases of listeriosis may continue to occur due either to delays in reporting, failure to discard _Listeria_-contaminated pork patties despite the recall, and the prolonged incubation period of up to 70 days. - Mod.ML
