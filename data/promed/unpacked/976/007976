SEIZURES, SEALIONS - CALIFORNIA (3)
====================================
Subject: Seizuring Sea Lions
In regard to Dr. Woodall's questions on potential virus involvement
in seizuring sea lions:
I was an investigator into an epizootic of seizuring sea lions in
California in 1992. Additionally, I have done some retrospective analysis
of clinical data collected by The Marine Mammal Center, Sausalito CA. Our
results were presented at the Biennial Conference in the Biology of Marine
Mammals last month in Orlando. Abstract requests or specific questions may
be directed to me.
No evidence of viral involvement was found. Regularly noted lesions found
in their brains were not consistant with a viral etiology.
