The town of El Eulma has been thrown into commotion following the death the
day before yesterday [13 Oct 2010] at the Hospital of Setif of a woman aged
52. She had been admitted as an emergency with her son after drinking
polluted water from a well in the mosque Ibn Okba Nafaa.

Since last Friday [8 Oct 2010], almost 26 people residing in the same city
who consumed the same water have been admitted as emergencies to hospital
in El Eulma. These people have suffered from abdominal pain, headache, and
vomiting. Prevention services have analysed water and found it to be
polluted with dead rats in an advanced state of decomposition. The
possibility of typhoid has been ruled out. Some sources have reported that
leptospirosis, a serious disease caused by germs from these animals, has
been diagnosed in all patients who are still under observation in hospital.
The well in question has been closed, and a major information and awareness
has been initiated by the prevention services to stem any possible spread
of the epidemic.

A total of 3 people, including a child aged 7, have died during the last 48
hours, in the wilaya (province) of Setif, after having contracted
leptospirosis. This infectious disease has been transmitted by sewage from
a well located at the Okba Ibn Nafaa mosque, located in the city Bourefref,
south of the city of El-Eulma.

The dead are a woman aged 52 years, a mother of 8 children, her 22 year old
son, and another of her children, aged 7. In addition, 26 others have been
hospitalized since the beginning of the week, at the CHU (Centre
hospitalier universitaire) Saadna Abdenour, Setif. The hospital cases have
the same symptoms as the victims who died -- vomiting, diarrhea, and
stomach pain accompanied by bleeding. Tests carried out have confirmed the
cause to be leptospirosis, an infectious disease caused by bacteria, also
called "rat fever", whose transmission has occurred indirectly through
contaminated water from the well of the Okba Ibn Nafa mosque.

Residents of the city told us that the infiltration of rain water and the
presence of rats in the wells would be at the origin of this epidemic. This
situation has put the health and civil authorities on alert. Officials then
decided to close the well and reviewed the distribution system for drinking
water. Doxycycline [doxycycline is the standard oral antibiotic used to
treat uncomplicated infection that does not require hospitalization and is
also used for chemoprophylaxis of leptospirosis] was distributed to the
population of the region, which, it must be noted, has been living in fear
since the death of one of the victims of this epidemic. According to
medical sources, the duration of treatment is 10 to 15 days for routine
cases but 2 months of hospital treatment may be required in severe cases.

[Leptospirosis occurs worldwide usually as a result of contact with the
urine of animals chronically infected with one of the several hundred
serovars of the spirochete _Leptospira interrogans_. Rodents, dogs, cattle,
and pigs are the usual reservoirs for this organism. As in the current
Algerian outbreak, leptospirosis has previously been reported to be aused
by drinking contaminated well-water (see
<http://www.bt.cdc.gov/disasters/earthquakes/haiti/leptospirosis_pre-decision_brief.asp>,
and <http://www.nih.go.jp/JJID/LEC-128.html>. Most patients with
leptospirosis have a non-specific mild, flu-like illness. Some patients
develop severe disease with myocardial, pulmonary, renal, or hepatic
involvement. Multiorgan failure, thrombocytopenia, and bleeding (as
occurred in some patients in the current Algerian outbreak) may develop.
Severe infection may be fatal in 5-40 per cent of cases.

Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation
of many infections, including leptospirosis, the diagnosis of leptospirosis
cannot be made confidently without laboratory confirmation. (See prior
ProMED posts: Leptospirosis, military personnel - Australia (QLD): not
20050329.0910 and Leptospirosis - Jamaica (02) 20071018.3409.) Although the
text is somewhat confusing, it seems that the diagnosis of leptospirosis
was confirmed by laboratory tests according to the 2nd news release above.

El Eula is a city in Algeria, located some 210 miles east of the capital
Algiers. It is the 2nd-largest city in Setif Province with a population of
105 130 (1998 census). (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Eulma>). The
