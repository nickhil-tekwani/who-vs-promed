Barn at Turfway quarantined for herpes: 80 horses restricted by equine
disease as major race nears
--------------------------------------
Days before its biggest event of the year, Turfway Park yesterday announced
it had quarantined a barn with 80 horses after 3 of the animals were
diagnosed with a strain of equine herpes, a potentially fatal
neurological-respiratory disorder.
Turfway president Bob Elliston said the Florence, Kentucky track was taking
the action to ensure the well-being of its horses and horses shipping in
for Saturday's USD 500 000 Lane's End Stakes, a Kentucky Derby prep and the
most significant race on Turfway's schedule.
Turfway's actions follow guidelines for dealing with infectious diseases at
the racetrack developed in early 1994 by the University of Kentucky's Gluck
Equine Research Center in Lexington. Kentucky becomes the fourth state to
report equine herpes this year, joining Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.
In late January, an outbreak killed 10 horses at the University of Findlay
in Ohio. The disease, which comes in a variety of strains and usually
attacks the respiratory and neurological systems, can attack horses of
various ages, according to Rood and Riddle vet Bobbie Barr. "In my
experience, it either affects younger horses or older horses , and the
younger ones will survive while the older won't," Barr said.
There are just 6 weeks remaining until the Kentucky Derby on May 3, but
Churchill Downs spokesman John Asher said the track felt reassured after
speaking with state health and vet officials. "At this point there seems to
be no cause for alarm," Asher said. "We'll just follow the lead on what the
state says, just like the situation with the West Nile Virus. Right now,
we're taking no special precautions, but certainly we'd be ready to do
whatever the state says and able to do that at an instant's notice."
