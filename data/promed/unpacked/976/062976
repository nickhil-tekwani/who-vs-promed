Raw oysters, Washington
-----------------------
The number of people sickened in the past 10 days from eating raw
oysters contaminated by naturally occurring bacteria statewide has
risen to 43. It's the largest outbreak in 8 years.
In response, the state Department of Health on Thu night, 20 Jul
2006, closed to recreational harvesting a long swath along the south
shore of Hood Canal as well as 2 inlets in South Puget Sound from
which the suspect oysters came. The areas are closed to commercial
harvest of oysters for raw consumption. Growers have the option of
having product shucked and labeled, "for cooking only."
After an August 1997 outbreak, the entire Hood Canal shoreline was
closed to harvesting. This is the only harvesting closure on the West
Coast due to shellfish poisoning so far in 2006, said state
epidemiologist Dr. Jo Hofmann.
About 2/3 of those sickened had eaten commercially harvested oysters; 2 were
hospitalized, but there have been no deaths. Health officials on Thu 20 Jul
2006, also renewed their seasonal advice to consumers to cook all shellfish
before eating, no matter where they come from, and make sure oysters and clams
are cooked thoroughly. Shellfish retailers were notified of the danger, and
restaurants were advised not to offer raw oysters on their menus.
"The prudent thing to do is cook shellfish," said Nancy Napolilli,
director of the state health department's food and shellfish safety
division.
State health officials also are investigating whether recent
illnesses reported in other states, as well as Canada, are connected
to consumption of raw oysters from Washington.
The culprit is _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_, a bacterium naturally
found in seawater. But warm water temperatures, warm daytime
temperatures at low tide when harvesting is done, and possibly a
change in the strain of bacteria itself may have combined to make the
bacterium especially prevalent in 2006, Napolilli said. The state
normally gets only about 20 cases of this infection a year, nearly
always during summer months when conditions are right.
The rash of illnesses triggered the harvesting closures, and Hofmann said
there could be more. "It's possible we will see more cases because it's just
the beginning of the summer."
Kitsap County Health District officials have posted all county
saltwater beaches, warning people about the danger, and state parks
on Hood Canal also are posted. The harvest ban on Hood Canal and
Totten and Eldon inlets in the South Sound could last for weeks and
possibly longer, Napolilli said.
The state tests waters in 10 growing areas associated with Vibrio
outbreaks on a weekly basis during the summer.
Local officials also have alerted health care providers throughout
the county to report suspected cases of illness, which manifests with
symptoms of diarrhea and nausea.
County health staffers are asking seafood restaurants not to offer
raw oysters on their menus. Restaurants that serve raw oysters are
required to post warnings to diners during the danger season. Seafood
markets are not required by law to discontinue sales of raw oysters
or post warnings, but all have or will be alerted, Health District
officials said.
Raw clams, New York
-------------------
There have been reports that people in New York City became ill after
eating raw clams -- an uncommon practice on the West Coast -- and
officials are tracking the source to determine if the suspect
shellfish also came from Washington waters.

[The number of cases in Washington State has grown substantially and
the implicated harvesting areas have been closed and public alerts
given.
There is not yet any public announcement of _V. parahaemolyticus_
related to shellfish in NY State. However, it appears that at least 3
recent clusters in New York City over the past 2 months have
occurred. The posting above implicates raw clams for these clusters.
The source of the clams is as yet undetermined. - Mod.LL]
