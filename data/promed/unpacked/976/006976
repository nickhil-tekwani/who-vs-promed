Polio in Congo -- 4 Nov 2010
---------------
An acute outbreak of poliomyelitis is occurring in the Republic of
Congo, with 120 cases of acute flaccid paralysis and 58 deaths. Half
the cases have been reported in the past 10 days, with the 1st case
occurring in early October [2010]. Two cases have been confirmed to
have been caused by wild poliovirus type 1, and laboratory testing continues.

Most cases are in young adults: among those cases for which age data
is available (43) at this time, 33 are between the ages of 15-25
years. Only one is under 5 years old, 3 are between 7 and 13 [years
old] and 5 are between 26 and 58 [years old].

The outbreak is due to imported poliovirus. Congo had recorded its
last case of indigenous polio in 2000. Investigations are ongoing to
determine definitively the origins of the virus.

Nearly all cases have been reported from the port city of Pointe
Noire, with cases also reported from Dolisie (2), Kayes, Bouenza,
Brazzaville, and Mvouiti (one each).

The Government of Congo has alerted the public to the outbreak and
launched an emergency response plan, with support from key partners,
including WHO, UNICEF and the US CDC. At least 3 nationwide
vaccination campaigns are expected, using monovalent oral polio
vaccine [mOPV] and targeting the entire population. The number,
geographic extent and target age groups of further campaigns will be
determined by the Government based on the evolving epidemiology. It
is anticipated that a multi-country campaign will be required to
cover bordering at-risk areas. New cases continue to be reported every day.

It is important that countries across central Africa and the Horn of
Africa strengthen AFP surveillance, in order to rapidly detect any
poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response. Countries
should also strengthen population immunity levels to minimise the
consequences of any virus introduction. As per recommendations
outlined in WHO's International Travel and Health, travellers to and
from Angola and DR Congo should be fully protected by vaccination.

Given the recent progress achieved in Nigeria (98 percent reduction
in cases this year [2010] compared to the same period in 2009), very
high priority is being given to rapidly controlling persistent
transmission such as in Angola and stopping new outbreaks such as in Congo.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp

[On 2 Nov 2010, there was a ProMED-mail post on an outbreak of as yet
undiagnosed polio-like illness in Pointe Noire, Republic of the Congo
that mentioned 8 fatalities and 20 cases (see Undiagnosed paralytic
illness - Rep. of Congo: (PN), RFI 20101102.3973). In that report,
the newswire mentioned that the majority of cases were in teenagers
and young adults. After mentioning non-polio etiologies for acute
flaccid paralysis, this moderator had the following comment: "That
being said, the most common etiology of an outbreak of a
poliomyelitis-like illness is infection with wild poliovirus (WPV).
The observation that the majority of cases are in teenagers and
adults may well represent the accumulation of pockets of susceptibles
at older ages following the interruption of WPV transmission in the
area due to intensive National Immunization Days through the years of
the polio eradication efforts. The last reported cases of WPV
associated polio reported in the Congo were in 2000 (WPV1 date of
onset 29 Sep 2000 and WPV3 date of onset 28 Nov 2000; see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Wildpolioviruslist.aspx>)."

The above report from the Global Alert and Response unit of WHO
confirms that the etiology of this outbreak is in fact WPV and
confirms that there had not been identification of WPV-associated
polio in the Republic of the Congo since 2000.

This moderator also highlighted the seemingly high case fatality rate
(CFR): "What is unusual here is the reported CFR of approximately
either 28.6 percent or 40 percent (the article is unclear if the 8
deaths were included in the count of 20 cases or if they were in
addition to the 20 cases mentioned) ... very high for both polio and
GBS." The above WHO report reflects an even higher CFR of 48.3
percent (120 with 58 deaths). This moderator wonders if this is a
reflection of significant underreporting of cases at this early stage
in the identification of the outbreak where the most severe cases
(and fatalities) are recognized 1st, and only later will the true
magnitude of this outbreak be documented.

As mentioned in the prior ProMED-mail post (Poliomyelitis - worldwide
(25): importation related 20101104.3994), one of the challenges
facing the polio eradication effort is a rapid recognition of WPV as
the etiology of AFP cases in countries that have interrupted
transmission of the WPV years earlier, and the population and
clinicians reject polio as part of the differential diagnosis. The
above report mentions that the 1st case had a date of onset in early
October 2010 -- suggesting that time from identification of a
suspected case to confirmation in the Congo was approximately one
month -- very different from that seen in Tajikistan where the
interval was approximately 2.5 months.
