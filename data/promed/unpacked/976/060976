Health Department issues mosquito-borne illness advisory
--------------------------------------------------------
The Alachua County, Florida, Health Department has issued a
countywide mosquito-borne illness advisory following positive tests
for Eastern equine encephalitis in 2 animals on opposite ends of the county.

A sentinel chicken near the Waldo area and a horse in southern
Alachua County between Gainesville and Micanopy both tested positive
for EEE, said Paul Myers, assistant director of the Alachua County
Health Department. The horse had to be euthanized, Myers said.

Myers added that the advisory is not focused on any geographic area
and residents countywide should take precautions to protect
themselves and their animals.

Following a quiet 2009, Myers said this could be a "very dangerous
year" statewide for EEE and West Nile virus. He said weather patterns
of lengthy rain followed by dry stretches coupled with bird
migrations may make it an active year for the mosquito-borne illnesses.

Already this year, there have been 4 reported [human] deaths in
Florida from EEE -- 1 each in Wakulla and Leon counties and 2 in
Hillsborough County, including an infant in the Brandon area,
according to the state Department of Health and the St. Petersburg
Times. There were no reported [human] deaths in Florida from EEE in 2009.

West Nile Virus infection and Eastern equine encephalitis are viral
diseases that affect the central nervous system. Their symptoms [in
humans] include headache, fever, fatigue, dizziness, weakness, and
confusion, according to the Health Department. Doctors should contact
the county Health Department if they believe a patient may have a
mosquito-borne illness. Florida Department of Health laboratories
provide testing services for those physicians.

In a press release, Anthony Dennis, the director of Environmental
Health at the Alachua County Health Department, said "a few simple
steps can drastically reduce the chances of contracting a
mosquito-borne illness."

Precautions are commonly known as the "5 D's":
-- Drainage: Check around your home to rid the area of standing
water, which is where mosquitoes can lay their eggs.
-- DEET: Insect repellents containing DEET
(N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide, or N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide) are
recommended. Picaridin and oil of lemon eucalyptus are other repellent options.
-- Dress: Wear clothing that covers most of your skin.
-- Dusk and Dawn: Avoid being outdoors during these times, when
mosquitoes are most active.

Florida Agriculture and Consumer Services Commissioner Charles
Bronson has also recommended that horse owners have their animals
vaccinated against EEE this year because of the increase in the
number of reported infections. The disease is fatal in horses 90
percent of the time, according to the Florida Department of Health.

[The article mentions the horse was euthanized but does not tell us
what happened to the sentinel chicken. In all likelihood the chicken
died of the disease as birds tend to be sensitive to the encephalitis
diseases. This includes such birds as emus and ostriches as well.

Horses should be vaccinated against the disease. A single injection
contains protection against EEE and WNV. Both diseases are
transmitted from the mosquito. The disease cannot be transmitted to
humans by birds or horses but rather through the mosquito. - Mod.TG]
