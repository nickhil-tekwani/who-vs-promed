Anthrax outbreak, Pehuajo, Buenos Aires province
-------------------------------------
An outbreak of anthrax occurred during the last week of December of 2019 in the partido (county) of Pehuajo, Buenos Aires province.

The affected herd -- 550 animals in a feedlot -- had been vaccinated 6 months previously with Sterne with vaccine from 2 different sources. A total of 16 animals died, all with similar signs of sudden death and blood extravasation from their natural openings (mouth, anus, urethra, vagina). A metatarsal bone was submitted for medulla examination and cultivation, and _Bacillus anthracis_ was grown and confirmed by PCR. The facility was subjected to quarantine, movement control, and vaccination. The carcasses were subjected to the standard treatment of "tapado controlado" of being covered by weighted tarpaulins for an extended period to allow degeneration, and in due course, the bones and hides will be incinerated. The Area of Anthrax Surveillance in the province of Buenos Aires (LA-1977-2019), which monitors the 30 counties in the province, confirmed that there were 2 outbreaks in 2019 involving the counties of Olavarria and Pehuajo.

[Dr. Noseda is our reliable source for information on anthrax in Argentina, and we have known each other for many years. I asked him why these vaccinated animals became infected, and he replied, "I think there is concealment of information and unreliable data, thus the reporting delay from 30 Dec 2019 to 13 Jan 2020. They apparently used 2 different vaccine brands (they have not identified which animals were vaccinated with one or the other). I am convinced that it was not a vaccine failure; it is more likely to have been unvaccinated animals." I cannot disagree. - Mod.MHJ
