The Jefferson County Department of Health and Environment and the Colorado
Department of Public Health and Environment are investigating an outbreak
of _Escherichia coli_ O157 infections among children in the Evergreen
mountain area. Today [7 Nov 2008], the state laboratory reported that
specimens obtained from elk droppings in the Evergreen area have tested
positive for the same strain of _E. coli_ O157 bacteria that was identified
in the children.

A total of 8 illnesses have been identified among children aged 4-12 years,
6 in Jefferson County and 1 in each of Clear Creek and Park Counties.
Illness among the children has occurred sporadically throughout the summer
and early fall, beginning in July 2008 and most recently in late October 2008.

"Today's lab results tell us it is very likely the children acquired the
_E. coli_ infection from exposure to elk droppings in the environment,"
said Alicia Cronquist, epidemiologist at the state health department. "This
is a highly unusual situation, and public health officials are continuing
to investigate how the elk in the area may have been exposed."

"We want to caution the public to take precautions by maintaining good
hygiene," said Gayle L Miller, senior epidemiologist with the Jefferson
County Department of Health and Environment. Most of the ill children had
exposure to elk droppings during outdoor recreation, at local fields, parks
or around their homes.

The outbreak investigation is continuing. Local public school and parks and
recreation authorities have been informed. The epidemiological
investigation will include phone surveys of some residents in the Evergreen
area.

[Shiga toxin producing _E. coli_ are classically associated with cattle.
Other animals can also be colonized in their gastrointestinal tract with
this pathogen including pigs, sheep, deer, and elk. It is interesting in
this posting that cases occurred in 3 bordering counties. It is not stated
which of the counties harbored the "smoking" elk droppings. Cases in 3
counties suggest wide spread elk colonization with _E. coli_ O157 but
having the same genetic strain more likely suggests a common exposure such
as food or water. As examples of the association of non-cattle ruminants
and this pathogen, _E. coli_ O157 has been isolated in wild deer (1),
linked to deer meat jerky (2) and deer and elk dropping have been
suggesting to be the source of waterborne _E. coli_ O157 (3).
