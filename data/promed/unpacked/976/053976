In the space of 3 weeks, 224 cholera cases and 3 deaths have been recorded in the general hospital in Ruzizi in Sange [South Kivu Province], the chief physician of area of health has indicated Friday [17 Jan 2014]. For the physician director of the general hospital of Ruzizi in Sange, Ndugu Kanyegere, the resurgence of this disease is related to the non-compliance of the rules of hygiene by the population. He has also called on the community to "well observe the measures of food hygiene, especially the water that they drink."

[2] Cholera - Namibia (Kunene Region)

Local and international health authorities in Namibia say they are making progress in efforts to contain a cholera outbreak that has already killed 11 people and affected hundreds in the country's northern region of Kunene. The outbreak of the waterborne disease in Kunene has worsened the situation in the region that is already reeling under severe drought. Many people in the region have been grappling with food and water shortages, as well as grazing for their animals, a situation compounded by failed rains over the past 2 years. An international health official has blamed the cholera outbreak on the prevailing drought. Aid workers from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in the Ministry of Health and Social Services, the Namibian Red Cross Society, and the WHO have been battling to contain the disease since it was 1st reported in early November 2013.

Recent statistics from the Ministry of Health and Social Services indicate that 11 people have died because of the disease, while 361 have been affected, with the majority being treated at Opuwo District Hospital.

New areas in the region with increasing suspected cases are Tjiuuo, Otjithoko and Tjomauuvi villages in the region, she said, adding that the Etanga catchment area that was affected most is now stabilizing with a fewer new suspected cholera cases being reported.

Currently, 35 people have been hospitalized at the Opuwo District Hospital, and the Ministry of Health and Social Services is urging community members with cholera symptoms to seek treatment immediately.

According to UNICEF, there are between 1.4 million and 4.3 million reported cholera cases per year worldwide, resulting in 28 000 to 142 000 deaths per year among the 1.4 billion people at risk in countries in which the disease is endemic. In these countries, children under 5 account for about half of the global incidence and deaths caused by cholera.

The Etanga area, where most of the cases of this waterborne disease are coming from, lies about 100 km [about 62 miles] from Opuwo. The majority of the people in that area are from the Ovahimba tribe, which still lives a nomadic lifestyle, making it virtually impossible to construct fixed and decent housing infrastructure for them.

[4] Cholera - Nigeria (Bauchi State)

No fewer than 3 persons have been hospitalized as cholera broke out in Khandahar and Doya communities in Bauchi Local Government Area of Bauchi State. Executive Secretary of the Bauchi State Primary HealthCare Development Agency, Dr Nisser Umar, said the 2 communities lacked clean sources of water, adding that their only sources of water had been chlorinated against the spread of the disease.

He said his agency was also making effort to avert the outbreak of cholera in the entire state, adding that apart from the 3 suspected cases of cholera, no death had been recorded. Umar said, "We got information that 2 Alimajiri children and another person were cholera positive in the area but not too serious; and we immediately took them to the hospital for treatment and they have been discharged.

He added, "It was discovered that they don't have clean drinking water and we have chlorinated all the wells in the area. Also the management of water board has moved to the area to clean and repair any pipe leakages. Presently, we don't have cholera epidemic, but we are on a red alert because we are surrounded by cholera-prone states and because our environment has exposed us like any other state, we may have similar situation. So, there is a need to avert the outbreak."

[5] Cholera - Myanmar (Kachin State)
Date: Wed 22 Jan 2014

Emergency supplies of medicine are needed for an outbreak of cholera in a camp housing civilians displaced by conflict in Kachin State's Mansi Township, a health care worker has told Mizzima.

The medical in-charge of the Mine Khaung refugee camp, La Htaw Naw Lai, said on 20 Jan 2014 that more than 50 children had been diagnosed with cholera at the start of the month, but the number with the disease had since declined.

Medicine was also needed to treat an outbreak of colds in the camp, La Htaw Naw Lai said. "We are having problems because we are running out of medicine in the camp," he said. He said a charity organization in the state capital, Myitkyina, had helped to ease a food shortage in the camp by supplying bags of rice, but the refugees needed more nutrition in their diet. La Htaw Naw Lai said there was also a shortage of drinking water and adequate shelter.

The camp houses more than 700 people from 3 villages, who were forced to flee their homes late in 2013 because of fighting between government forces and the Kachin Independence Army.
