Waterborne outbreak of giardiasis in Bergen, Norway
------------------------------------------
An outbreak of [_Giardia intestinalis_ (also known as _Giardia lamblia_ -
Mod.EP)] has been identified in the city of Bergen (approximately 250 000
inhabitants), a popular tourist destination on the western coast of Norway.
Since the beginning of September 2004, the public health authorities have
been notified of 365 laboratory-verified cases of giardiasis. The majority
of the cases have had symptoms of diarrhoea and abdominal cramps. Most
cases are aged between 20-40 years, and so far few cases have been reported
among children and the elderly. Preliminary interviews with cases indicate
that a public water supply providing water to central areas of the city is
the source of the outbreak. In addition, samples taken from this water
supply have shown _Giardia_ cysts in sufficient quantities to transmit the
disease (5 cysts per 10 litres in treated water). The water treatment plant
being investigated receives surface water, and the water treatment includes
chlorination, but no efficient steps to remove [_G. intestinalis_].
The exposure period is estimated to be from the end of August 2004 until
measures were implemented on 5 Nov 2004. The public receiving their water
from the [contaminated] water supply have been advised to boil the water,
and the local water company has also redirected water from other supplies.
Possible sewage contamination from houses located on the hillside above the
water reservoir are being investigated. Hotels and other tourist facilities
have been informed and have taken necessary precautions. An outbreak
investigation including a case control study is currently being carried out
by the local health and food control authorities in Bergen. Field
epidemiologists from the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at
the Norwegian Institute of Public Health have been assisting the local
authorities. Maps of the water supply zones in Bergen and further
information can be obtained from the website of the municipality of Bergen

[Norway draws almost all its drinking water from surface sources. A survey
of raw water sources in 1998 and 1999 found 9 percent of samples containing
_Giardia_ spp. cysts and 2.5 percent containing both _Giardia_ and
_Cryptosporidium_ cysts. The study discusses the source of the
contamination and points to the number of domestic animals within the
catchment area of the water reservoirs (Robertson & Gjerde. Scand J Publ
Hlth 2001,29:200-7). - Mod.EP]
