Undiagnosed deaths, horses - Canada (Nova Scotia) 990115055823
Date: 10 Feb, 99
From: Dr. MaureenWichtel <mwichtel@Upei.CA>
[Regarding the horses in Nova Scotia that recently died mysteriously, a
veterinarian involved in the case has been so kind as to update us on the
*true* happenings on this - Mod.TG

The owner of the horses did not have expendable funds for a complete *work
up* of these animals. He brought in one horse which was dead for post
mortem, and another which was showing typical clinical signs. We thought
that he was going to leave the pony with us to let us do some diagnostics
and provide some nursing care, but when he found out that it would cost him
money, he took the pony and went home.
Our physical examination was consistent with botulism or Herpes virus
myelitis. These were our two top differentials. Post mortem examination was
unrewarding, however we did rule-out rabies and Herpes virus. All tests
(mouse inoculation, toxin assays of feed and GI cultures) were also negative
for botulism. So, as is the case with many neurologic disease cases, no
diagnosis was made. Importantly, only ONE of the six or seven horses that
died was allowed to be necropsied, so, I'm not surprised that our diagnostic
yield was low.

[Often owners don't want 1) the heartache of necropsy on their animals, 2)
it costs too much to get a complete work up, 3) on limited funds vets can
tell you a few things, such as what it is not, but without adequate
diagnostic support it is impossible to tell what it is, 4) often when a
horse dies it is VERY inconvenient in the middle of shock and grief to get a
vet out, and it may not be possible for the vet to come out - Mod.TG
