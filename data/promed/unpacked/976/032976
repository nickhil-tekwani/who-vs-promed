While bluetongue has spread with lightning pace across the country, Shumen has a case of anthrax.

An animal in Zagoriche village was euthanized a few days ago, and all cattle in Shumen have been vaccinated against anthrax. [This outbreak was reported on 22 Aug 2014 in ProMED-mail post 20140822.2714789 and was confirmed. - Mod.MHJ]. Yesterday [3 Sep 2014], it became clear that the anthrax threat had extended to Razgrad.

According to the chairman of the Association of Private Veterinary Practitioners, Dr S K Zavetskotko, Brestovene village has an outbreak of anthrax. Doctors fear that the latent danger of contamination exists in 2 villages in the area where a few years ago, it was torn with this deadly cattle disease.

The head of the regional Agency for Food Safety in Razgrad, Dr Ibrahim Yahova, confirmed that veterinary authorities are aware of the danger of anthrax in the region. He added that despite the increased workload caused by the outbreak of bluetongue, vaccination will begin against this new menace. Immunizations will start immediately and are expected to cover farms in risk areas by mid-September [2014].

In the meanwhile, the bluetongue epidemic continues and has caused severe losses because of dead animals and the suspension of all trade and cattle and sheep market closures. Veterinarians predict that as early as September [2014], there will be fewer cases of infected animals thanks to the seasonal drop in temperature, diminishing mosquito activity.

[For a map of Bulgaria, go to http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/europe/bulgaria.jpg. Razgrad is in central Ruse, and Shumen is in Varna; both provinces are in NE Bulgaria.

This report indicates that one or more additional cases of bovine anthrax have been reported in north west Bulgaria. Disease problems like company. It appears that the regional Bulgarian veterinary services are badly stretched at present. - Mod.MHJ
