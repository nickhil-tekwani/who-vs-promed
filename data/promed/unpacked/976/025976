Veterinarians are warning farmers to be prepared for an upsurge in spring of the deadly cattle parasite _Theileria orientalis_ ikeda.

The disease causes anaemia in cattle and has been a problem mainly in herds in the upper half of the North Island over the last 2 years.

But this year [2014], it spread to nearly 500 beef and dairy herds throughout the North Island.

Steve Merchant from the Veterinary Association said the warmer climate in the north encouraged cattle ticks which spread the parasite.

"What we learnt from last year [2013] was that when animals get stressed, this can go from sub-clinical to clinical, and all of a sudden there is an outbreak, so certainly spring is on watch when the pressure and stress of production starts to hit the herds, so we are very much watching this closely and being ready."

Steve Merchant said _Theileria_ could be treated successfully and that it was the more vulnerable animals that can become infected.

"You generally find the 1st 2 or 3 years [with] the populations that survive, you build up a natural herd immunity and the clinical signs aren't such an issue. So I think the bigger risks are the ones that are outside the current affected areas. I think it would be naive to think they're safe, because things travel quickly, so we definitely need to keep them on watch."

[This parasite is establishing itself and even possibly spreading.
