From: "Richard Montali" <RMONTALI@NZP.SI.EDU>

In August 1999 we diagnosed a fatal pox-like disease in 2 European red
squirrels (_Sciurus vulgaris_) at the Smithsonian National Zoo in
Washington, DC (USA). One of the squirrels originated from Europe but had
been in the collection for several years. The red squirrels had access to
an outside exhibit with potential exposure to wild gray squirrels (_S.
carolinensis_). The red squirrels were treated for fleas earlier before the
onset of the disease.
Diagnosis of the disease was based on multiple cutaneous and lymphopoietic
organ lesions containing intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies characteristic of
a poxvirus. Negative stained particles derived from the lesions and viral
cultures performed at the Southeastern Wildlife Cooperative in Georgia were
suggestive of a leporipoxvirus, which in gray squirrels causes fibromas. The
lesions in our 2 red squirrels, however, appeared more like the disease of
wild red squirrels described in the UK that is caused by a parapox virus
with periocular and mucocutaneous involvement without discrete fibroma
formation. Apparently, introduced gray squirrels have been implicated as a
carrier of parapox in the UK, but to our knowledge squirrel parapox has not
been described in North America.
We are looking for anyone interested in animal pox-like agents that might be
working with these viruses and could help us further characterize our
isolate serologically or by molecular techniques.
