Human anthrax case, Prov. de Santa Fe (San Jeronimo del Sauce)
--------------------------------------------------------------
On 4 Jul 2014, we were sent a sample for identification taken from a blood culture of a person who had died. The said patient came from a rural part of San Jeronimo del Sauce, Santa Fe [Province]. We ran all the usual tests (biochemical, innoculation, PCR) and demonstrated that it was a culture of _Bacillus anthracis_. The patient had presented with a fever, cutaneous anthrax affecting a middle finger, and axillary adenitis [swelling in the armpits], and died within 48 hours.

A retrospective epidemiologic investigation found that there had been a number of acute bovine deaths thereabouts, and the patient had harvested hides from said animals in order to make a lasso. The veterinarians in this area report that the level of bovine vaccination against anthrax is somewhere between low and sporadic.

[Santa Fe Province is in northern Argentina, on the west side of the Parana river. It is cattle country; see: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/argentina_pol96.jpg. For San Jeronimo del Sauce, go to: http://www.fallingrain.com/world/AR/21/San_Jeronimo_del_Sauce.html.

Most anthrax activity in Argentina is in the pampas, Buenos Aires Province, and so in the outer provinces there can be a lack of awareness of the local incidence and risks accruing. And in conjunction, various scavenging birds take advantage of the situation; see: Miguel D. Saggese, et al, (2007) First detection of _Bacillus anthracis_ in feces of free ranging raptors from central Argentina, Journal of Wildlife Diseases, 43: 136-141. - Mod.MHJ
