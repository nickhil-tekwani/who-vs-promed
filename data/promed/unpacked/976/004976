Myanmar reports new bird flu outbreak in private farm north of Yangon
-----------------------------------------------------
Myanmar has detected the H5N1 bird flu virus among chickens on a
private farm, an official said Wednesday [13 Jun 2007].
Than Hla, an official at the Livestock Breeding and Veterinary
Department, said the virus was detected in a small farm in Bago, 80
km [49.71 miles] north of Yangon, early this month, marking the
country's first outbreak of the deadly virus since April [2007].
"About 28 chickens died at a private poultry farm in the outskirts of
Bago starting 3 Jun 2007," said Than Hla, adding that laboratory
tests confirmed on 7 Jun 2007 that some of chickens were infected
with H5N1. About 1000 birds from the farm have been killed as a
precaution, he said. He did not specify the number of birds that
tested positive for the disease.
The livestock department has also kept a close watch on the area, he
said, adding that the outbreak remained under control because the
farm was located away from other poultry farms and residential areas.
Myanmar had reported outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu in the outskirts of
Yangon in February and April [2007] and had slaughtered more than 60
000 chickens and other birds. Before those cases, Myanmar last
reported an H5N1 outbreak among poultry in March 2006. It has
reported no human H5N1 cases.
