Anthrax in the Goulburn Valley, Victoria, Australia
---------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Anthrax incidents in the Goulburn Valley in January/February 2007
have been contained. Over a period of 6 weeks, 37 cattle died of
anthrax on 10 farms. No cases have occurred since 23 Feb 2007.
Introduction
------------
Although details are sketchy, anthrax in the Goulburn Valley area of
northern Victoria is thought to have had its beginnings in the 1880s
when anthrax-contaminated imported bone meal was used as fertiliser
on local pastures. Previous to 1997, anthrax had not been reported
from this part of the state since 1914.
A large and unusual large outbreak occurred in the summer/autumn of
1997, which affected over 80 properties. Sporadic outbreaks on single
properties have been reported occasionally since then.
The 2007 outbreak
-----------------
A small outbreak occurred in January-February 2007, which affected 37
cattle on 10 properties at 3 distinct foci. One focus, involving
multiple properties, was at Stanhope, and the other 2, each involving
single properties only, were at nearby Tatura and Wyuna. These
appear to be unrelated to the Stanhope focus.
Acute deaths in dairy cattle were reported starting from 19 Jan 2007,
on a property near Stanhope in Victoria's Goulburn Valley irrigation
area. Upon the diagnosis of anthrax, the Victoria Department of
Primary Industries (DPI) immediately instituted quarantine measures,
incineration of carcasses, and vaccination including on neighbouring
properties. Death sites were disinfected with formalin to reduce
spore contamination.
Further deaths began occurring at the end of January [2007] on nearby
properties, leading to a corresponding enlargement of the vaccinated
area. A policy was adopted of vaccinating cattle on neighbouring
properties in a ring 2-deep around infected properties, and on all
properties within 1 km. (0.62 miles) of infected properties. A total
of 8 properties were affected in this focus, with 31 cattle dying.
The last confirmed case at this focus occurred on 12 Feb 2007.
Irrigation-related earthworks may have unearthed buried spores, which
precipitated the outbreak at Stanhope, and spores may have spread
through the movement of insects, foxes, and scavenger birds. None of
the 8 farms involved have ever reported anthrax prior to this year
[2007].
At Tatura, a case of anthrax was diagnosed on a single property on 6
Feb 2007, with quarantine, incineration, and ring vaccination being
instituted as described above. Three cattle died on this property,
with the last death being reported on 12 Feb 2007. This farm had a
history of anthrax in the 1997 outbreak, and yearly vaccination was
carried out between 1997 and 2000 (as is carried out on all farms in
Victoria where anthrax is detected).
The 1st case at Wyuna was diagnosed on 18 Feb 2007; 3 died in total
with the last death on 23 Feb 2007. Again, a ring vaccination policy
was instituted. This farm had never reported anthrax prior to this
year [2007].
In addition to the vaccinations cited above, given that climatic
conditions were clearly favourable for anthrax, the Department also
decided to vaccinate cattle and sheep on all properties known to have
been infected in outbreaks since 1997.
Knackery [renderer] surveillance was quickly implemented, which
involved the screening of all livestock presenting at the local
knackery with sudden death or suggestive history of anthrax. In face
of this intense surveillance, no cases have been recorded since 23
Feb 2007. The temporary lab operated until the end of March 2007. No
stock positive to anthrax were detected at the knackery during that
period, though cases were detected on farms through farmer
notifications, indicating that the level of reporting to DPI by
farmers and veterinarians was excellent.
A total of 34 604 cattle on 218 properties have been vaccinated in
the 2007 incidents. Given that sufficient time has elapsed for an
effective level of immunity to develop in animals on infected and
at-risk properties, the situation has returned to normal. The
possibility of further sporadic cases cannot, however, be ruled out
altogether.
Comment
-------
Both the farming community and government veterinary staff in the
Goulburn Valley have become used to sporadic outbreaks in what has
now become known as the "anthrax season," hence the rapid and
comprehensive response to the outbreak.
The ability to rapidly trace cattle movements related to infected
properties was greatly enhanced by the use of NLIS (the National
Livestock Identification System). The system uses electronic cattle
identification and movement recording to trace cattle movements
through a national database.
A system of ante-mortem and post-mortem inspections at abattoirs
ensures that anthrax does not enter the human food chain. In this
particular outbreak, use of NLIS was able to rapidly show where
animals had moved to from infected properties in the weeks prior to
the outbreak.
The controls routinely instituted by DPI when anthrax is detected
ensure that animals are not presented for sale or slaughter from
affected or vaccinated herds for the appropriate periods.
In late January 2007, one knackery worker contracted the cutaneous
form of anthrax, highlighting the need for knackeries to be vigilant
in their application of biosecurity measures. The high level of
awareness by knackery workers of the risks of anthrax ensured that
timely medical attention was sought and the skin infection was
treated without complications.
Human intestinal and pneumonic anthrax are unknown in Australia.
