The United Arab Emirates [UAE] has imposed a temporary ban on imports of living cattle, their non-processed skins, and derivatives from Jordan after it reported cases of lumpy skin disease (LSD).

A resolution issued by the Minister of Environment and Water, Dr. Rashid Ahmed bin Fahad, based on reports by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), says the ban will remain in place until the epidemic in Jordan is declared clear. The resolution explains that the move was taken as part of the ministry's strategy to protect public health.

Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is an acute infectious disease of cattle and has significant economic importance due to its endemic threat to livestock, health, and the dairy industry. An outbreak could cull as much as 10 percent of the herd, while disease prevalence could reach up to 45 percent.

[While the measures undertaken by UAE in respect to LSD are in line with prevailing international animal trade requirements, it deserves to be said that Jordan has become liable to such measures due to its commendable transparency. LSD, regarded endemic in most if not all African countries, is most likely circulating at present in other Middle East countries without being identified or reported. On top of spread by infected bovines, the virus may spread by various arthropods, including mosquitoes and flies. Jordan's notification has been preceded by notifications from Israel, Lebanon, and the Palestinian authority. The disease is known to be endemic in Egypt. Its eradication is not likely to be achieved without stamping out.

It will be interesting to note whether targeted surveillance for LSD has been considered or undertaken in the Arabian peninsula, including the UAE, as well as in other regional countries from which imports to the UAE are probably allowed. - Mod.AS
