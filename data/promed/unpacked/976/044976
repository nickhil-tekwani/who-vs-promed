The report [that "concern arose when doctors discovered that the rate of
the problem appeared much higher" than that seen during the clinical
testing is incorrect.
If you do the math, you will quickly see that the rates seen during the
pre-approval phase are 5 times greater (5/10 000) than the rates observed
in the population (1/10 000). Perhaps the AP writer is including
sub-clinical cases in which case, the word "appeared" is incorrect.
As epidemiologists, it is our duty to ensure that the press does not
unnecessarily create panic in the population.

[I'll bet that what the doctors were concerned about was the increasing
number of cases. It's the word "rate" that was incorrect. - Mod.JW
