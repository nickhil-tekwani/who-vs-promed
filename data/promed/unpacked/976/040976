Dog owners have been warned to be on alert for a vomiting bug which has struck down "3 times as many" animals as normal in recent weeks -- with reports of fatalities from one vet practice.

Symptoms for the illness -- known as gastroenteritis -- include extreme vomiting, diarrhea, and blood or mucus in the animal's stools.

Vets have reported a huge rise in the normal numbers of cases, with Pentland Vet Clinic reporting that the illness had claimed the lives of some pets, leaving owners devastated.

The disease of the intestine is caused by various factors, including ingesting contaminated rubbish or faeces belonging to other animals.

The Currie-based clinic posted on its Facebook page: "There is a very nasty gastroenteritis bug doing the rounds just now, not just in our area, but across Edinburgh.

"The emergency clinics are being inundated with cases and some, sadly, have proven so severe as to be fatal.

"We would warn everyone to be especially vigilant of what your dog may be eating when off lead, and to take fresh water with you to try and avoid them drinking from puddles, ditches, or stagnant water."

Rebecca Rex, a veterinary nurse at Market Cross Veterinary Clinic, in Dalkeith, said the clinic had seen "3 times as many cases" of the seasonal illness in recent weeks, but she said things were starting to improve.

[The information included in the media report above is rather unspecific. Clinical observations, including temperature of patients and description of the excrements (hemorrhagic?), as well as laboratory test results and PM findings, are requested.

In view of the apparent wide distribution of the condition, reported from several clinics throughout Edinburgh, a common cause, infectious or otherwise (including the exclusion of pet-food involvement) deserves to be investigated by a central veterinary institution/authority.

The most common causes of infectious gastroenteritis in dogs are canine parvovirus (CPV), canine coronavirus (CCV), canine rotavirus (CRV), and _Campylobacter_ spp. - Mod.AS
