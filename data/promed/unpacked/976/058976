Environmental Health and Zoonoses Coordination reports for

epizootic in Apure State. This time the site involved is Paez town, Palo
Quemao area, located between El Amparo (Venezuela) and Arauca (Colombia).
The epizootic was corroborated by multiple witnesses, and started 10 days ago
(Tuesday, January 21, 2005). [Evidently, dead monkeys were found, but
laboratory confirmation is lacking. - Mod.JW]
Anti-yellow fever administrative [vaccination] coverage in the surrounding
towns is as
follows:
Apure state: Munoz, 182 percent, Romulo Gallegos, 114 percent;
Barinas state: Pedraza, 81 percent, Ezequiel Zamora, 135 percent, Andres
Eloy Blanco, 241 percent;
Tachira state: Fernandez Feo, 197 percent, Cordoba, 116 percent, Jun� 93
percent, Rafael Urdaneta, 129 percent.
Rapid Coverage Monitoring activities are being performed to clarify the
claims of [more than 100 percent] coverage, and preventive blockage
activities are also being performed. [Can somebody explain what preventive
blockage activities are? - Mod.JW]
