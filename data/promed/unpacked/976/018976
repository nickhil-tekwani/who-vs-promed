PAHO appoints Canadian Ronald St. John as Ebola incident manager
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Director of the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO), Dr. Carissa F. Etienne, has appointed Dr. Ronald St. John, an infectious disease expert who led Canada's SARS response, as incident manager for PAHO/WHO's coordinated response to Ebola.

PAHO/WHO is providing support to countries in the Americas to prepare for the possible introduction of Ebola in the region. The goal is to ensure the early detection of any imported case and effective containment to prevent its spread. To date, no cases of Ebola have been reported in Latin America or the Caribbean.

A Canadian citizen, St. John is a board-certified physician in preventive medicine, with post-graduate training in infectious diseases and public health. He has 35 years of experience -- including 9 as a program coordinator and division chief at PAHO/WHO -- in public health programs, legislation, and policy development. He has participated in emergency preparedness and response to communicable diseases, including SARS and HIV, in Canada, the United States, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and countries outside the Americas.

At PAHO/WHO, St. John will oversee the incident management system, established in the Organization's Institutional Response to Emergencies and Disasters plan. He will lead a team of PAHO/WHO experts and coordinate Ebola preparedness actions in PAHO member countries and with institutional partners.

Within this framework, PAHO/WHO is mobilizing expert alert and response teams starting this month [November 2014] to work with Member States in Latin America and the Caribbean to prepare for the potential introduction of cases of Ebola virus disease.... -- more

[This is excellent news. Ron is a no-nonsense public health administrator who has already been quoted on ProMED pointing out the futility of airport screening on arrival as currently practiced worldwide -- see ProMED-mail post Ebola virus disease - ex Africa (09): WHO, Spain, Australia, Canada, USA 20141009.2848352. He advocates instead screening on departure from West African airports and screening at hospitals if symptomatic on or after arrival overseas. - Mod.JW]
