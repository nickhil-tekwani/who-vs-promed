Malaria cases double in Ahmedabad in 2012
-----------------------------------------
Mosquitoes are back with their menace in Ahmedabad [Gujarat state] as the number of patients suffering from the disease [malaria] has doubled this year [2012]. The city has reported 630 cases of the disease in January-March 2012, up from 300 during same time last year [2011].

Civic body officials attribute this increase to re-occurrence of the disease and increase in areas under their surveillance. However, there is hardly any difference in number of _Plasmodium falciparum_ (Pf) but there is almost a 100 percent increase in cases of _Plasmodium vivax_ (Pv) strain of malaria.

According to IK Patel, deputy municipal commissioner, AMC [Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation] health department, re-occurrence of malaria in the last couple of months of 2011 is the reason for a surge in number of cases reported in January-March, 2012. "We have asked health officials to submit exact data of re-occurrence so that necessary action can be taken," said Patel.

Meanwhile, AMC has chalked out an action plan to combat the increased incidences of Pv malaria in the city. Around 500 people have been recruited by the civic body to conduct door-to-door survey to get a definite number of malaria cases in the city. This will increase area under surveillance of AMC from 40 percent to almost 100 percent. There will also be a substantial increase in number of patients screened from the current 30 percent after this surveillance, said sources in AMC's health department.

Apart from the vector-borne disease, a large number of people in the city are suffering from gastroenteritis, jaundice, typhoid, dengue, and cholera. However, there is 50 percent reduction in number of these cases compared to last year [2011].

[Ahmedabad is the largest city in the state of Gujarat, between Pakistan and Mumbai. _P. vivax_ is endemic and _P. falciparum_ is seen. According to the National Vector Borne Diseases Control programme (http://nvbdcp.gov.in/Doc/mal-situation-Feb12.pdf), Gujarat has reported 3095 malaria cases in 2012 of which 728 were from _P. falciparum_, with no deaths. On this background 150 cases alone in the main city, Ahmedabad, seems many. Furthermore, malaria is most probably underreported.

Ahmedabad can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of India at http://healthmap.org/r/1iSU. - Mod.EP]
