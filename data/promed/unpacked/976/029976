The citrus crop is rapidly expanding in the Province of Santa Cruz de la
Sierra, Bolivia. Citrus, mostly planted by small growers, currently
comprises approximately 15 000 ha. Sweet oranges (_Citrus sinensis_) and
mandarins (_C. reticulata_) are the main citrus-types grown primarily for
internal consumption. Recently, there has been an increase in incidence of
leprosis-like symptoms (round to elliptic lesions on the leaves, chlorotic
to necrotic lesions in young twigs, and depressed small lesions on the
fruits). These symptoms were associated with infestations by the
tenuipalpid mite _Brevipalpus_ sp.
To verify whether Citrus leprosis virus was the causal agent of the
observed symptoms, leaf and fruit samples (mostly from Valencia sweet
orange) were collected from commercial groves in El Torno, 32 km south of
Santa Cruz, and Yapacani and Colonia San Juan, 130 km northwest of Santa
Cruz. Small fragments of these samples were placed immediately in a mixture
of glutaraldehyde and paraformaldehyde in cacodylate buffer and later
processed with transmission electron microscopy at ESALQ, Piracicaba, SP,
Brazil. Some of the leaf samples were dried at 35 deg C and used for
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with primers that
specifically amplify portions of the genome of Citrus leprosis virus,
cytoplasmic type (CiLV-C) (1) at Centro APTA Citros, Cordeiropolis, SP,
Brazil. Brevipalpus sp. mites were also collected and kept in 90 percent
ethanol for further identification at the University of Florida,
Gainesville and ESALQ.
In the samples from the 3 surveyed areas, transmission electron microscopy
confirmed the presence of short bacilliform particles within endoplasmic
reticulum cisternae and electron-dense viroplasms in the cytoplasm, typical
of infection by CiLV-C (2). CiLV-C specific primers amplified DNA fragments
of expected sizes in RT-PCR from dried leaf samples that came from these 3
localities. Direct sequencing of at least 3 amplicons of each sample
confirmed the identity of the virus.
The consensus sequence of the putative movement protein gene in samples
from Yapacani and Colonia San Juan (GenBank Accessions Nos. AY960216 and
AY960215, respectively) were identical and exhibited 99 percent nucleotide
and 98 percent amino acid homology with the Brazilian isolate sequence
available at GenBank (Accession No. AY289190). The consensus sequence of
the putative replicase gene found in the sample from El Torno (GenBank
Accession No. AY960214) exhibited 96 and 93 percent nucleotide and amino
acid homology, respectively with the Brazilian isolate (GenBank Accession
No. AY289191).
Sampled mites were identified as _B. phoenicis_ (Geijskes), the known
vector of CiLV-C (2). The symptomatology, particle morphology and
cytopathology, detection by molecular methods and the association with
infestation by _B. phoenicis_, together indicate that the foliar, stem, and
fruit lesions in sweet orange observed in the Santa Cruz region were caused
by CiLV-C.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of this virus in Bolivia.

[Citrus leprosis has cost millions of dollars in damage to crops in South
America, where it is well established. Symptoms include small,
chestnut-brown spots -- commonly referred to as nailhead rust -- that
appear on fruit, leaves, and green twigs of afflicted trees. The resulting
loss of tree canopy growth combined with premature fruit and leaf drop
reduce plant productivity. Sweet orange and some mandarin varieties are
most susceptible. Entomologist Ronald Ochoa, mite expert at ARS's
Systematic Entomology Laboratory (SEL) in Beltsville, Maryland, says citrus
leprosis virus, which substantially damaged Florida's orange crop in the
early 20th century, is slowly progressing northward from its outbreak
epicenter in South America. He says the disease's presence in Central
America has raised warning flags among U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA) scientists at ARS and at the Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service (APHIS). "We all view this as a grave threat to the nation's citrus
industry," Ochoa says.
Leprosis is one of the most important citrus diseases in Brazil and likely
in other citrus-producing regions of South America. This problem is caused
by Citrus leprosis virus (CiLV) and is transmitted by mites of
_Brevipalpus_ spp. It also occurs in other South American countries. This
northbound spread of CiLV is considered a serious threat to the citrus
industry of the United States. Brazilian scientists depended upon analyses
of symptoms and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). However, accurate
assessment of symptoms require field experience and can be confused with
those caused by other plant pathogens. A region of the CiLV genome was
sequenced and used to design specific primers that recognize only CiLV.
These primers were used in RT-PCR to test more than 70 citrus plants from
different species and varieties, originating from various geographic
locations, and were shown to recognize only CiLV-infected plants. This is
the 1st report on the development of a molecular-based method for the
diagnosis of citrus leprosis. Disease management of citrus leprosis is by
control of the mite vector. According to C. A. Oliveira, most of the
currently available chemicals used to control mites are effective. Some of
the products presently recommended in Brazil are azocyclotin, cyhexatin,
hexythiazox, fenbutatin oxide, propargite and quinomethionate.
