Benin health officials announced this week 3 Lassa fever cases (2 confirmed, 1 probable) reported in the municipality of Parakou in Borgou Department in the northern part of the country.

According to local press, the head of the department of public health, Dr. Emmanuel Obolli Job, said the cases all come from the village Taberou (Nigeria) located 5 km from Tandou in the commune of Tchaourou.

Faced with this epidemiological situation, actions were carried out to inform the prefect of the department, local elected officials, and officials of the health zones of Borgou.

The health department then carried out a rapid risk assessment at Balawal 2 and broadcast awareness messages via radio stations on hygiene measures. The department developed plans for communication and the management of confirmed and probable cases, followed up contacts of the 2 confirmed cases, and routed samples of these cases to the National Laboratory for Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers in Cotonou.

Speaking on strategies to fight the spread of the virus, Dr. Emmanuel Obolli Job put special emphasis on communication and information for the benefit of the population, mass communication (social mobilization, broadcast radio messages), and sensitization of religious leaders and actors of civil society organizations. He also said that schools, markets, universities, bars and restaurants, bus stations of the communes of Borgou, and especially those that border Nigeria, will also be involved in strategies to prevent spread.

Raising awareness door to door in the commune of Tchaourou, epidemiological surveillance, and follow-up of contacts are, according to the doctor, all potential tools to be considered to fight against the virus.

"There is no danger in the department of Borgou. All steps are being taken to contain the epidemic," said the departmental director of health, Dr. Imourou Karimou Yacoubou, adding that if antiviral treatment begins early through the administration of drugs, including ribavirin, there is hope against Lassa fever.

[These cases in Benin that originated in Nigeria are not the 1st ones this year (2018). The previous Lassa fever outbreak in Benin this year occurred in February 2017 and also involved case importation from Nigeria. A previous WHO report stated that Lassa fever is endemic in bordering Nigeria, and, given the frequent population movements between Nigeria and Benin, the occurrence of additional cases is not unexpected. Strengthening of cross-border collaboration and information exchange between the 2 countries is, therefore, needed. - Mod.TY
