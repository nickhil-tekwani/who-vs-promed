Chytridiomycosis, an infectious disease that has devastated frog and
other amphibian populations overseas, was confirmed in imported pets
in Tokyo, the 1st reported case in Asia, experts said Thursday [11 Jan 2007].
The disease will not affect humans. But there is no effective measure
to eradicate chytridiomycosis once it spreads in the natural
environment, the experts said. Once in the wild, it can ravage ecosystems.
Biological experts are planning to issue an emergency joint statement
Saturday calling for stronger quarantine procedures, tougher
monitoring on sales and distribution channels and other countermeasures.
Chytridiomycosis was found in frogs imported from Central and South
America that were kept as pets in Tokyo, according to the experts.
Of the 35 pet frogs of 11 species, 14 died in November and December 2006.
Examinations conducted by Azabu University researchers confirmed on
25 Dec 2006 that the frogs died of chytridiomycosis, probably after
being infected by another frog or frogs bought in late October.
At least one frog from Latin America at a pet shop in the Kanto
region tested positive for the disease earlier this month.
The course of action now is to ensure chytridiomycosis does not
spread outdoors.
The emergency joint statement will be issued by 16 organizations,
including the Japanese Society of Zoo and Wildlife Medicine, the
Herpetological Society of Japan and World Wide Fund for Nature Japan.
The statement will call on frog keepers not to release water that
kept dead frogs into the outdoor environment. It will also call on
frog importers and sellers to ensure their frogs are not infected.
"If you find an abnormality, no matter how small it may be, I'd like
you to consult with a veterinarian," Yumi Une, an assistant professor
of Azabu University's School of Veterinary Medicine, said. "There are
steps for antisepsis and treatment, and the disease will not be
transmitted to humans. Whatever you do, please do not release
(infected frogs) outdoors."
Chytridiomycosis was confirmed in 1998 as the disease that caused a
drastic decline in Australia's frog population in the 1990s.
The disease stems from the chytrid fungus (_Batrachochytrium
dendrobatidis_) and causes sporadic deaths in some amphibian
populations and has a 100 percent mortality rate for others,
according to Australia's Department of the Environment and Heritage.
Since the Australian case, the disease has been found in areas of the
United States, Central and South America, Africa and Europe. In
Panama, for example, 48 amphibian species were infected, and their
numbers plunged by about 90 percent.
Researchers later found that chytridiomycosis had spread from west to
east at an annual rate of about 28 km after the disease 1st
infiltrated Panama in 1995.
With wild frogs wiped out in some areas in just 2 months, a project
to protect more than 20 frog species at zoos and other facilities was
initiated in Panama.
One huge problem in eradicating the disease is that chytrid fungus
can survive in water for several weeks. Experts warn that the fungus
can easily proliferate in Japan because of the country's many
mountain streams. They also are concerned that the disease will
spread among pets.

[Chytridiomycosis is a key example of an emerging infectious disease
in wildlife. The most important factor driving the emergence of such
wildlife diseases is the anthropogenic (human-borne) introduction of
pathogens into new geographic areas (pathogen pollution). The
Japanese deserve to be encouraged for their effort to confine the
disease indoors; unfortunately, this is a complex, or almost
unattainable goal.
