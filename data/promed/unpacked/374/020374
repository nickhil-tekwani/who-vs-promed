Epidemiological comments
Some cases of fever in horses started to be reported to the Israeli
Veterinary Services. Samples were taken from known sick horses and the
Veterinary Services requested immediate reports from [attending practitioners].

Positive serology to equine viral arteritis (EVA) was obtained [by] the
Equine Viral Diagnosis Laboratory in the Kimron Veterinary Institute on 2
Oct 2008. Since the disease has shown up for the 1st time in Israel,
samples were sent to Weybridge Laboratories for confirmation. In Weybridge
laboratory, samples were also positive to EVA.

At first, quarantine was imposed on initially affected farms but, on 7 Nov
2008, after receiving the requested reports, since it was observed that the
disease was spreading, the Israeli Veterinary Services put quarantine over
all the country for 96 hours, before receiving the positive results from
the reference laboratory in Weybridge.

Control measures
Measures applied
- quarantine
- movement control inside the country
- no vaccination
- treatment of affected animals (symptomatic)

Measures to be applied
- screening
- vaccination in response to the outbreak(s)

Diagnostic test results
1. Laboratory name and type: Equine Viral Diagnosis Laboratory, Kimron
Veterinary Institute (national laboratory)

2. Laboratory name and type: Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA)
(OIE's Reference Laboratory)
Tests and results
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Equidae / seroneutralization test (SNT) / 7 Nov 2008 / positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[According to the data above, it seems that the disease initially appeared,
practically simultaneously, in 4 centrally located stables in the HaMerkaz
(Center) district. The 2nd, countrywide disseminated wave, started 3 weeks
later. It may, thus, be assumed that the primary outbreak occurred at the
beginning of October 2008. Has this been preceded by the
introduction/import of equine(s) or equine semen into one or more of the 4
stables, which are rather close to each other (distance 1 to 8 km)? The
further countrywide spread may be explained by contacts within public
equestrian events; a subject for further investigation.

The rather exceptional measure adopted (96 hour countrywide standstill) can
be understood as a step to avoid further spread during possible
movements/equestrian events during the last weekend (8-9 Nov 2008). We are
told that the veterinary services are currently contemplating legislation
requiring official identification and registration of all horses in Israel.

The following text, derived from chapter 2.5.10 of OIE's Terrestrial
Manual, provides valuable background on EVA:

"Equine viral arteritis (EVA) is a contagious viral disease of equids
caused by equine arteritis virus (EAV), a positive-sense, single-stranded
RNA virus, and the prototype member of the genus _Arterivirus_, family
_Arteriviridae_, order _Nidovirales_. Epizootic lymphangitis pinkeye,
fievre typhoide, and rotlaufseuche are some of the descriptive terms used
in the past to refer to a disease that clinically very closely resembled
EVA. The natural host range of EAV would appear to be restricted to equids,
although very limited evidence would suggest it may also include new world
camelids, such as alpacas and llamas. The virus does not present a human
health hazard.

"EAV is present in the horse population of many countries worldwide. There
has been an increase in the incidence of EVA in recent years that has been
linked to the greater frequency of movement of horses and use of
transported semen.

"While the majority of cases of acute infection with EAV are subclinical,
certain strains of the virus can cause disease of varying severity. Typical
cases of EVA can present with all or any combination of the following
clinical signs: fever, depression, anorexia, leukopenia, dependent oedema,
especially of the limbs, scrotum, and prepuce of the stallion,
conjunctivitis, ocular discharge, supra or periorbital oedema, rhinitis,
nasal discharge, a local or generalised urticarial skin reaction, abortion,
stillbirths and, rarely, a fulminating pneumonia, enteritis or
pneumo-enteritis in young foals. Regardless of the severity of clinical
signs, affected horses almost invariably make complete recoveries. The case
fatality rate in outbreaks of EVA is very low; mortality is usually only
seen in very young foals, particularly those congenitally infected with the
virus, and very rarely in otherwise healthy adult horses.

"EVA cannot be differentiated clinically from a number of other respiratory
and systemic equine diseases, the most common of which are equine
influenza, equine herpesvirus 1 and 4 infections, infection with equine
rhinitis A and B viruses, equine adenoviruses, and streptococcal
infections, with particular reference to purpura haemorrhagica. The disease
also has clinical similarities to equine infectious anaemia, African horse
sickness fever, cases of Hendra virus infection, Getah virus infection, and
toxicosis caused by hoary alyssum (_Berteroa incana_). After infection, EAV
replicates in macrophages and circulating monocytes and is shed in various
secretions/excretions of acutely infected animals, in especially high
concentration from the respiratory tract. A variable percentage of acutely
infected stallions later become long-term carriers in the reproductive
tract and constant semen shedders of the virus. The carrier state, which
has been shown to be androgen dependant, has been found in the stallion,
but not in the mare, gelding or sexually immature colt. Unequivocal
evidence of the carrier state has only been found in stallions
serologically positive for antibodies to the virus. While temporary
down-regulation of circulating testosterone levels using a GnRH
[gonadotropin-releasing hormone] antagonist or by immunisation with GnRH
would appear to have expedited clearance of the carrier state in some
stallions, the efficacy of either treatment strategy has yet to be fully
established. Concern has been expressed that such a therapeutic approach
could be used to deliberately mask existence of the carrier state."
