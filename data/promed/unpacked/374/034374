Jordan reports 2 new corona virus cases
---------------------------------------
Jordan announced that it has registered 16 corona virus infections, since the virus was 1st reported back in 2012.

The Ministry of Health yesterday [27 Aug 2015] announced 2 new cases for 2 males, 78 and 48 years old, that were in direct contact with an infected person at the hospital.

The health ministry said the new cases are under an epidemiological investigation the ministry started for persons who dealt with infected people, adding that one man was in a stable condition, while the other was in critical condition.

[With the addition of these 2 cases, it makes 4 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Jordan in the past 3 days. The mention that these 2 newly confirmed cases were acquired in the healthcare environment suggests that one or both of the 2 earlier reported cases this week may have been undiagnosed in the healthcare environment for a period of time, without adequate infection control measures. Hopefully the areas of exposure did not involve overcrowded emergency rooms as seen elsewhere, so that it will be relatively easy to interrupt transmission in the affected healthcare facility (or facilities) involved. The addition of these 2 newly confirmed cases raises the number of cases reported in Jordan to 23 -- including those 7 retrospectively confirmed through serologic testing involved in the 1st MERS-CoV outbreak in April 2012 (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (31): Jordan, retro. case ID, WHO, RFI 20130617.1777989).

Jordan reports 1st coronavirus death in 2015
--------------------------------------------
- Number of deaths from coronavirus in Jordan up to 7 since 2012

The Jordanian Ministry of Health announced late on Thursday [27 Aug 2015] the death of a 60-year-old male who contracted coronavirus.

Health Ministry spokesman Hatem al-Azrai told Anadolu Agency that "the deceased man had returned to Jordan from Saudi Arabia and was placed in a hospital on Tuesday [25 Aug 2015] because of his bad condition until he died today [Thursday]."

This is Jordan's 1st recorded death as a result of the virus in 2015. Seven people have died from the virus in Jordan since 2012, according to al-Azrai.

The spokesman called on Jordanians who are getting ready to go to Saudi Arabia for the Hajj pilgrimage in September [2015] to be cautious.

On Tuesday [25 Aug 2015], the Saudi health ministry announced the registration of 6 new deaths from the virus, which has left 498 people dead since September 2012.

Also called MERS, the corona disease has been reported in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Tunisia, Jordan, Egypt and Oman.

The virus, for which no cure currently exists, is known to destroy the lungs and kidneys.

As of 12:00 noon today [28 Aug 2015] there have been a total of:
1173 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
502 deaths
606 recoveries and
65 currently active cases including 9 cases of home isolation

In the past 24 hours there have been:
2 newly confirmed cases
0 newly reported deaths
1 newly reported recovery

[reported case fatality rate: 42.8 percent]

Information on newly reported cases (2 cases):
(Both cases reported in Riyadh)
1- A 50 year old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker, currently in stable condition. No known contact with other case(s) in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.

2- A 68 year old Saudi female, non-healthcare worker, currently in critical condition. History of contact with other case(s) in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.

Information on newly reported recovery (1 case):
A 41 year old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker from Riyadh. [There was a 41 year old Saudi male from Riyadh reported on 16 and 22 Aug 2015. - Mod.MPP]

[In the past 24 hours there have been only 2 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported. Both cases were from Riyadh, one of whom did not give a history of known contact with other case(s) in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. Looking at cases reported in Riyadh, on 24 Aug 2015, 4 of the 6 newly reported cases (from Riyadh) that day did not give a history of known contact with other case(s), on 22 Aug 2015, 1 out of 7 newly reported cases did not give a history of known contact with other cases and on 21 Aug 2015, 1 out of 6 newly reported cases did not give a history of known contact with other cases. So a question that comes to mind is that with increasing numbers of cases denying known contact with other cases, is there ongoing community transmission of the virus, or are there cases appearing in other healthcare institutions that have not as yet been identified as locations with ongoing MERS-CoV transmission?

[4] Saudi Arabia, considering banning MERS contacts from Hajj - media report
Date: 28 Aug 2015
Source: Xinhua News Agency [edited]
http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-08/28/c_134566133.htm


Saudi Arabia is mulling banning those who have been in contact with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus patients from performing Hajj this year, according to local newspaper on Friday [28 Aug 2015].

This will be part of many precaution measures to ensure the Hajj season free of the contagious disease, an official from the Health Ministry told the local Al Eqtisadiya newspaper.

The ban might also cover medics from the King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh who have witnessed a limited outbreak of MERS cases.

The official said in the recent month, 71 new MERS cases have been reported, mostly in Riyadh.

The total number of confirmed MERS cases since its appearance is 1173, of which 606 have been cured and 56 are still undergoing treatment. Fatalities have risen to 502 cases since the outbreak in Riyadh.

The MERS virus can cause symptoms such as fever, breathing problems, pneumonia and kidney failure.

[This is the 2nd media report mentioning possible new restrictions aimed at reducing the likelihood of MERS-CoV transmission during the Hajj. In the past week, there was mention of possibly banning slaughtering of camels in the Hajj locales, but rather donating to organizations that would perform the ritual slaughter for donation to the poor (see MERS-CoV (114): Saudi Arabia, animal reservoir, camels, Hajj 20150823.3597358 and MERS-CoV (113): Saudi Arabia, experimental vaccine, inc. cases 20150822.3596073). This latest measure if implemented will potentially prevent healthcare workers that might be incubating a MERS-CoV infection from attending the Hajj. The complicating factor has been the identification of MERS-CoV infection in healthcare workers who have denied contact with a known case in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. A conundrum to say the least. - Mod.MPP]

[5] ECDC risk assessment 27 Aug 2015

Main conclusions and options for response
The majority of the MERS cases continue to be reported from the Middle East, and specifically from Saudi Arabia. Given the substantial number of people travelling between the Middle East and EU countries, sporadic imported cases to Europe can be expected. In addition to the Hajj, large numbers of people travel to and from the Middle East throughout the year.

When compared to previous years, the increase in reported MERS cases in August [2015] was unexpected and is mainly explained by a large, ongoing, nosocomial outbreak in Riyadh linked to one healthcare facility.

The extent to which other healthcare facilities in Riyadh are affected is unknown, as is the number of asymptomatic individuals who may be infected with MERS-CoV.

The role of hospitals as amplifiers of MERS-CoV infection is now well known, making the strict and timely application of comprehensive infection prevention and control measures all the more imperative.

Sporadic, imported cases can be expected in EU/EEA Member States, and are associated with a risk of nosocomial spread. This highlights the need for awareness among healthcare workers, early detection through functioning testing algorithms, preparedness planning and stringent infection control precautions.

Advice previously issued for travellers, including pilgrims, and healthcare workers remains valid.

Event background information
Worldwide situation
Since April 2012 and as of [27 Aug 2015], 1511 cases of MERS, including 574 deaths, have been reported by health authorities worldwide (Figure 1 and 2, and Table 1).

[Figure 1: Distribution of confirmed cases of MERS by month* and probable place of acquisition of infection, March 2012-[27 Aug 2015] (n=1 511), Figure 2: Distribution of confirmed MERS cases by place of probable infection, as of [27 Aug 2015] (n=1 511), and Table 1: Confirmed MERS cases and deaths, by country of reporting, March 2012-[27 Aug 2015] are available at the source URL.]

ECDC threat assessment for the EU
The majority of the MERS cases continue to be reported from the Middle East, and more specifically from Saudi Arabia. Due to the substantial number of people travelling between the Middle East and EU countries, and the continued circulation of the virus in camel populations causing nosocomial and family clusters in the Middle East, imported, sporadic cases to Europe continue to be expected.

When compared to previous years, the increase in reported MERS cases in August [2015] was unexpected and is mainly explained by a large, ongoing, nosocomial outbreak in Riyadh linked to one healthcare facility. As of [27 Aug 2015], there had been no decline in the weekly number of cases, indicating that the outbreak is continuing. The health authorities in Saudi Arabia have established strict control measures in the affected hospitals to contain the outbreak. The extent to which other healthcare facilities in Riyadh are affected and are linked to the outbreak hospital is currently unclear. A high-level WHO mission to Saudi Arabia is currently assessing the situation. Previous WHO missions have concluded that sub-optimal implementation of infection prevention and control procedures have contributed to outbreaks in the Middle East and South Korea.

Affected groups include patients hospitalised for other reasons, healthcare workers and patients visiting the emergency department. The role of hospitals as amplifiers of MERS-CoV infection is now well known, making the strict and timely application of comprehensive infection prevention and control measures all the more imperative. Such measures include effective triage of patients with respiratory infections for the timely detection and isolation of MERS-CoV cases, hand hygiene and the use of personal protective equipment.

The number of asymptomatic individuals (if any) who tested positive during contact follow-up in Riyadh in the current outbreak is unknown [15, 16]. The current guidance and case definition implemented by Saudi Arabia does not require systematic testing, or notification of asymptomatic laboratory-confirmed individuals [15]. However, the WHO case definitions require reporting of the latter as confirmed cases to WHO [17]. During the large 2014 nosocomial outbreak in Jeddah, up to 25 [percent] of the detected cases were asymptomatic prior to testing positive, although it is unclear how many developed symptoms later on [6] [references can be found at the source URL].

The pattern of this hospital outbreak is similar to other hospital outbreaks related to MERS-CoV in the past in terms of severity, affected age-group and fatalities. Though previous nosocomial outbreaks in Saudi Arabia have not yet been fully documented, probable factors contributing to the extent of the outbreak might be a large, overcrowded emergency department; low awareness and late case identification; poor compliance with hygiene and protection precautions and imprudent case management, with infected healthcare workers serving to spread the disease. The recent large nosocomial outbreak of MERS-CoV in South Korea has illustrated the potential for such nosocomial outbreaks in other parts of the world, following single imported cases.

In addition to epidemiological studies assessing the detailed risk factors for primary cases, rapid documentation of the nosocomial clusters in a publicly available format is still urgently needed to guide global public health preparedness and response. Furthermore, the possible role of asymptomatic MERS cases in transmitting the virus needs to be carefully assessed.

According to WHO, analysis of sequences from currently circulating viruses does not show any substantial changes that would contribute to a higher transmissibility or pathogenicity [18].

Mass gathering events such as the Hajj provide a basis for communicable diseases to spread easily among humans. In 2014, Lessler et al. made a scenario analysis with predicted number of MERS-CoV cases during and on return from the Hajj [19]. They concluded that only small numbers of people would become infected during the event, some of whom would become sick upon return to their country of residence. A specific surveillance system is in place during the Hajj to monitor various relevant diseases, including MERS-CoV [20]. Despite intensive surveillance in Saudi Arabia and in countries to which pilgrims returned after the Hajj in 2013, no cases of MERS were detected among the estimated 2 million pilgrims. In 2014, several cases detected outside of Saudi Arabia were in pilgrims returning from the minor Umrah pilgrimage, but not from the Hajj. Given the current large number of cases, many of which are linked to the current hospital outbreak in Riyadh, as well as the constant detection of sporadic cases across the country in recent months, it is possible to identify cases among pilgrims or in the healthcare facilities providing services to the pilgrims. Sporadic, imported cases can be expected in EU/EEA Member States and are associated with a risk of nosocomial spread. This highlights the need for awareness among healthcare workers, early detection through functioning testing algorithms, preparedness planning and stringent infection control precautions.

The risk of widespread transmission of MERS-CoV in the community after sporadic importation into the EU/EEA remains low.

[I highly recommend reading the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment in its entirety for an excellent summary of what has been going on worldwide with respect to MERS-CoV. The conclusions with respect to risk to the European community (EU and EEA) are applicable worldwide, provided there are good infection control procedures at healthcare facilities where importations present. The weak link for MERS-CoV control has been the nosocomial outbreaks. Key weaknesses in infection control observed have included:
- failure to ascertain and assess travel histories of individuals presenting to emergency rooms or outpatient clinics so potentially contagious individuals are in the same area as others (including those with co-morbidities presenting for their co-morbidities and accompanying family members)
- failure to implement respiratory pathogen control measures at arrival at health facility for patients with febrile respiratory diseases
- insufficient use of isolation facilities for potentially contagious individuals
- overcrowding of emergency rooms (with patients and accompanying family members)
- multi-patient wards with overcrowding (with patients and accompanying family members)

Overall, as of yesterday, 27 Aug 2015, there have been 1511 cases of MERS-CoV infection worldwide, including 574 deaths (case fatality rate 38.0 percent). According to Table 1 of the above report, 1165 (77.1 percent) of the reported cases and 498 (86.8 percent) of the deaths have been reported from Saudi Arabia.

So, with the perceived low risk of major spread from importations into the European community (EU and EEA) and presumably elsewhere, will there be a 10th meeting of the IHR emergency committee prior to the Hajj this year (21-26 Sep 2015) and if so, what will be the recommendations? - Mod.MPP]
