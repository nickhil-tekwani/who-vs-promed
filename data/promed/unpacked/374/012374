A new outbreak of cholera in the Mbale district of eastern Uganda has
killed 83. Director of Health Services Richard Othieno has blamed
the resurgence of the disease on members of a sect in Soono Parish who hid
patients from the medical patrols. Dr. Othieno did not identify the sect,
but another source said it was "Red Cross" [not THE Red Cross - DP, a
group that collects dead bodies in the belief that resurrection was imminent.
