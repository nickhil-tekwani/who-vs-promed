Two cases of rabies reported in last week
-----------------------------------------
Two Henry County [Georgia] neighborhoods are under rabies alerts after a recent outbreak. The 2 cases happened within the last week [22-29 May 2015], and in one case, 8 members of a family have to undergo rabies treatment.

Henry County Animal Control officials said there have been 4 rabies cases since February [2015], which is unusual. "Normally I start receiving these type of cases around late June or early July," said rabies control officer Vince Farah.

The latest case happened in Stockbridge on Tuesday [26 May 2015] when a dead cat tested positive for rabies. It [belonged to a family who] live in the Carriage Trace neighborhood. They said they took in the stray cat when it walked up to their door this past Christmas Day [25 Dec 2014]. Now they and their 6 children, ages 4 to 14, have to undergo rabies treatment for the next 3 weeks.

"He started following me around and just meowing a lot," [one of the family] said. "And then by Saturday [23 May 2015] and Sunday [24 May 2015] he was attacking us. He would come and cuddle up next to me and then if I reached down to pet him, he would attack me," she said. [The cat] was put to sleep and tested positive for rabies. Now their neighborhood is under a rabies alert. Theirs is the 2nd neighborhood in the last week that is under a rabies alert. On 22 May [2015], the Lake Dow community in McDonough was put on alert.

On 22 May [2015] a resident found a dead raccoon in her back yard that her 2 Brittany spaniels [had] killed. She took the raccoon to animal control and it tested positive for rabies. "I saw them in the middle of the yard with a mound of fur between them and I recognized it was a raccoon as soon as I saw the striped tail," she said. Both her dogs had been vaccinated but have to be quarantined in their back yard for 45 days. "So they have to stay in the yard and no dogs, no extra people around them or anything like that," she said.

"We have to control this outbreak, we have to keep this nipped in the bud," Farah said. Animal control put warning signs up in each neighborhood asking residents to be vigilant about their pets' behavior as well as any wildlife they see. "Their outdoor animals need to be vaccinated immediately and closely observed for the next 45 days," Farah said.

Sheep exposes 4 people to rabies in Abbeville County
----------------------------------------------------
Four people have been referred to their health care providers for consultation after being exposed to rabies in Abbeville [Abbeville County, South Carolina] by a sheep that tested positive for the disease, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control [DHEC] said.

The sheep was potentially exposed to an aggressive skunk, which was not available for testing, roughly one month ago. Three of the 4 victims provided routine husbandry care for the sheep. The 4th victim was potentially exposed on Monday [25 May 2015]. The sheep tested positive for rabies on Wednesday [27 May 2015].

"To reduce the risk of getting rabies, we recommend that people avoid wild animals acting tame and tame animals acting wild," said Sandra Craig of the health department Bureau of Environmental Health Services. "About 275 South Carolinians must undergo preventive treatment for rabies every year, with most exposures coming from bites or scratches by a rabid or suspected rabid animal. Wild animals contract the disease most often, but domestic pets and livestock can contract rabies as well.

"If you think you have been exposed to the rabies virus through a bite, scratch or the saliva of a possibly infected animal, immediately wash the affected area with plenty of soap and water. Then be sure to get medical attention and report the incident to DHEC."

In 2014, there were 139 confirmed cases of animal rabies in South Carolina. There have been 61 confirmed cases in animals statewide so far this year [2015]. The sheep is the 1st animal to test positive in 2015 from Abbeville County. Two animals tested positive in that county in 2014. The sheep is the 14th livestock animal to test positive for rabies in the state since 2002.

South Carolina law requires pet owners to vaccinate dogs, cats and ferrets. The law does not require owners of agricultural animals to vaccinate for rabies, although rabies vaccines for cows, horses and sheep have been approved by the US Department of Agriculture.

The health department strongly recommends vaccinating:
- horses, cattle and sheep that have frequent contact with humans;
- livestock that are particularly valuable;
- animals used for raw milk or raw milk product production.

Horses must be vaccinated for rabies before being taken out of state.

Anyone who sees a wild animal that seems sick should contact the local animal control office, veterinarian or wildlife rescue/rehabilitation group for help. If a wild animal is acting strangely among a herd of livestock, contact the local health department Environmental Quality Control office.

[For Henry County, Georgia, go to http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/georgia_90.jpg. It is south east of Atlanta and above the "E" in the digital map.

For Abbeville County, South Carolina, go to http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/south_carolina_90.jpg. It is in north west South Carolina and on the border with Georgia.

Cattle and horses are not infrequently afflicted with rabies; in Latin America, commonly via vampire bats. But rabid sheep are unusual. A quick search brought up 2 OIE reports from Uruguay in April 2014, of sheep apparently infected by _Desmodus rotundus_ bats (vampire bats): Rabies - Uruguay (02): (CL) bovine, ovine, OIE 20140413.2400798, and Rabies - Uruguay: (CL) bovine, ovine, OIE 20140403.2376692. As desmondontine bats do not occur in South Carolina, we can rule them out as a cause of this ovine outbreak, and revert back to a more probable raccoon contact. Virus strain identification will clarify this.

Sheep rabies is sporadically seen in Israel; see (2015): Rabies - Israel (02): (HZ) wolf, human exp susp, RFI 20150513.3359678. In Nepal in 2014; see: Rabies - Nepal: (Kathmandu) human, canine 20150323.3249257; in New York state in 2014; see: Rabies - USA (03): update, January 2015 20150125.3117212. And more -- just search on rabies AND sheep, ticking the 'Post' part of the ProMED keyword search. - Mod.MHJ
