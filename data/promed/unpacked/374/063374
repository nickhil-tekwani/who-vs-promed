Russia declared import ban on EU cattle
---------------------------------
Russia is to close its borders on 20 Mar 2012 for cattle from the European Union.

The reason is the outbreak of the Schmallenberg virus [SBV] in the EU, says the Russian veterinary service Rosselkhoznadzor. The European Commission calls the measure a disproportionate response.

Earlier, Russia had already announced an import ban on cattle from Germany and 3 other EU countries and for sheep, goats and genetic material [embryos and semen].

The Russians are worried about the continued expansion of the Schmallenberg virus within the EU. Russia is also concerned about the lacking cooperation between different EU countries. According to Rosselkhoznadzor, Russia gets too little security guarantees from the EU. The service will carry out talks with representatives of the European Commission on a solution to the problem.

[On 2 Mar 2012, the same source (Dutch agricultural newspaper Boerderij="Farm") reported the following:

"Russia, Ukraine, Morocco, Egypt and Jordan have closed their borders for Dutch breeding heifers. In addition, imports have been put in question by other countries, though not officially. A consignment of 30 breeding heifers underway to Algeria were not allowed entrance and remained in Spain, eventually sold to a Spanish party to prevent their slaughter.

"Restrictions on Dutch exports have been applied by other countries: the United States and Japan discontinued the import of bovine semen and bovine embryos. Argentina, Japan, Kazakhstan, Morocco, Ukraine and Russia have closed their borders for bovine semen. It is clear that exporters are severely affected by restrictions imposed by third countries due to the Schmallenberg virus".

Restrictions on international trade in animals and animal-derived material deserve to be installed and applied in accordance with science-based principles. Since SBV is not (yet?) included in OIE's disease list, such internationally-agreed requirements are not yet officially defined. However, on 16 Feb 2012, OIE's Scientific Commission for Animal Diseases endorsed "recommendations for safe trade", prepared by an experts ad-hoc group, addressing meat, milk, semen, embryos, live adult non pregnant animals, live pregnant animals and live newborns. For background and details, please refer to posting 20120217.1045067. The endorsed document is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Our_scientific_expertise/docs/pdf/Recommendations_for_safe_trade_Schmallenberg_virus.pdf.

According to the scientific committee's report, the recommendations for safe trade "will be updated when relevant".-Mod. AS].
