Highly pathogenic avian influenza, France
-----------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 28 Nov 2016 from Dr Loic Evain, directeur general adjoint, CVO, Direction generale de l'alimentation, Ministere de l'Agriculture, de l'Agroalimentaire et de la Foret, Paris, France

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 17 Nov 2016
Date of confirmation of the event: 26 Nov 2016
Reason for notification: new strain of a listed disease in the country
Causal agent: highly pathogenic influenza virus
Serotype: H5N8
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Marck, Pas De Calais
Date of start of the outbreak: 17 Nov 2016
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Not applicable
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Eurasian Wigeon:_Anas Penelope_(Anatidae) / 75 / 25 / 25 / 0 / 0

Affected population: on 17 Nov 2016, mortality was observed in a batch of call-ducks (_Anas strepera_ and _Anas penelope_) kept on a private body of water in the town of Marck. The samples taken in the framework of the wildlife mortality surveillance (SAGIR network) confirmed the presence of H5N8 virus on 26 Nov 2016. A 2nd batch of call-ducks (35 animals) that stayed on this body of water will be slaughtered as a preventive measure. All of the call-ducks will be destroyed this day (28 Nov 2016).

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Eurasian Wigeon: _Anas Penelope_(Anatidae) / 33 / 33 / 100 / 33
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with wild species.
Epidemiological comments: this notification concerns call-ducks; these birds are not included in the definition of poultry as per Chapter 10.4 of the OIE Terrestrial Code. Hence, this outbreak should not trigger poultry trade restrictions and does not affect France's status regarding highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). For the record, unless something new happens, France will recover its status as a country free of HPAI on 3 Dec 2016. As the episode of mortality in wildlife happened in a zone where the risk had been considered as high (Ministerial Decree from 16 Nov 2016, qualifying the risk level as regard to avian influenza), poultry farms have been subjected to extra biosecurity measures and containment ever since. An epidemiological investigation was performed, and surveillance measures have been strengthened around the outbreak.

Control measures
Measures applied: screening; disinfection/disinfestation; stamping out; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: ANSES Reference National Laboratory, Ploufragan (National laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Eurasian Wigeon / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 26 Nov 2016 / Positive
Eurasian Wigeon / virus sequencing / 26 Nov 2016 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

The location of the outbreak can be seen on the interactive map included in the OIE report at the source URL above.

[The following information came from the joint OIE/FAO press release entitled: "New avian influenza's rapid spread to Europe threatens poultry sector especially in low-resourced countries," published 24 Nov 2016, and available at http://www.oie.int/en/for-the-media/press-releases/detail/article/new-avian-influenzas-rapid-spread-to-europe-threatens-poultry-sector-especially-in-low-resourced/ and http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/267175/icode/.

[The press release above was published in 2014, not 2016. The text has been deleted. - Mod.CRD]

All avian influenza (AI) viruses can be transmitted among birds through direct contact with secretions from infected birds, especially faeces or through contaminated feed, water, equipment, and human clothing and shoes.

They are readily transmitted from farm to farm by the movement of domestic live birds, people (especially when shoes and other clothing are contaminated), and contaminated vehicles, equipment, feed, and cages. Highly pathogenic viruses can survive for long periods in the environment, especially when temperatures are low.

Several factors can contribute to the spread of all AI viruses including: the movements of people and goods, marketing practices (live bird markets), farming practices, and the presence of the viruses in migratory wild birds‚Äù (http://www.oie.int/en/for-the-media/press-releases/detail/article/questions-and-answers-on-high-pathogenic-h5n8-avian-influenza-strain-update-27112014/. - Mod.CRD]
