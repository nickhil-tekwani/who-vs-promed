Jellyfish deaths spark hunt for Australian killer
------------------------------------------------
A tiny, near-invisible box jellyfish blamed for killing 2 foreign tourists
in tropical north Australia may have gotten a bum rap, but the case has
opened a Pandora's box for marine scientists.
Until this year the sting of the peanut-sized, translucent Irukandji
jellyfish found off far north Queensland was thought to be little more
than a painful irritant. The verdict puzzled experts who knew the box
jellyfish's venom could trigger the so-called Irukandji syndrome,
causing excruciating back pain, sweating, and nausea, but not death.
Following tests, experts cleared the Irukandji jellyfish, or _Carukia
barnesi_, of one of the tourist's death, but in the process discovered
there are more undetected deadly jellyfish lurking in Australian waters,
with no antivenin available.
Jamie Seymour, a jellyfish expert with James Cook University's School
of Tropical Biology in Cairns, said the stinging cells he tested from the
deceased were a mystery. "This sting was from a jellyfish I've never
seen before. It is a totally new species and opens up the floodgates as
we just don't know what is out there," said Seymour.
Marine scientists now fear there could be, undetected in the waters off
northern Australia, up to 6 other species of Irukandji, on top of the
_Carukia barnesi_, that cause a deadly variety of Irukandji syndrome.
A tourist, aged 44, died in April 2002 when a sting received while
diving on the Great Barrier Reef brought on a rapid rise in his heart rate
and blood pressure, leading to a cerebral hemorrhage. A second tourist,
58, from Yorkshire, died in January 2002 after being stung swimming
off Queensland's Hamilton Island. The sting aggravated an existing
heart condition and no extra tests were conducted.
Authorities suspect the deaths were not the first fatalities from
Irukandji stings in Australia, just the first recorded, as symptoms after a
sting resemble decompression, a stroke or other conditions that may be
listed as the cause of death. "There is no doubt others have died from
stings but people weren't in the know until now," Dr. Peter Fenner, co-
founder of the International Consortium of Jellyfish Stings.
The first recording of Irukandji syndrome was noted in northern
Australia by a doctor during the 1940s. But the mystery set of illnesses
was not named until 1952, when it was identified by Dr. Hugo Flecker,
who traced the world's deadliest jellyfish, the _Chironex fleckeri_, a
larger relative of the Irukandji, which has killed 67 people in Australia.
He named the syndrome after the Aboriginal people of the Irukandji
tribe living at Palm Cove, about 25 km (16 miles) north of Cairns, who
for generations knew of an invisible danger in the water that could
trigger a strange sickness.
It was not until 1966 that now deceased Cairns doctor Jack Barnes
found the culprit. He spotted a tiny jellyfish, its bell measuring just one
inch across, with stinging cells on its body as well as its four 20-inch-
long tentacles. The culprit was named in the doctor's honor, _Carukia
barnesi_, and is commonly known as the Irukandji jellyfish--one of
about 15 box jellyfish known in Australia and 24 globally.
Irukandji syndrome has also been recorded elsewhere, across the
Indian and Pacific oceans, but not as often as in Queensland where
hordes of tourists a year are attracted to the pristine tropical beaches
and the Great Barrier Reef to dive and snorkel.
Every year, between November and May, about 30 people are taken to
hospital in far north Queensland suffering from Irukandji syndrome,
but a lack of research funding has hindered progress in finding an anti-
venin. But this year the numbers seeking treatment jumped to about
200 with 2 deaths, as the tiny jellyfish was washed ashore from its
usual deep waters by prevailing currents and winds, slipping through
protective nets shielding beaches.
Seymour said the deaths sparked a new interest in jellyfish, with the
federal government committing [Aust.]$56 000 for further research
which was hoped to attract private sector funds. "We desperately need
research funds because until we know what kind of jellyfish there are,
how can we produce antivenin for them?" Seymour said. "The last few
months have shown that we really know nothing about what is going
on with box jellyfish."
