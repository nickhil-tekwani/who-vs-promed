Summary
-------
Background
Since the 1st description of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), it has not been known how long patients shed the virus in respiratory secretions. Thus, we analyzed the available data on time to negative MERS-CoV test in patients with confirmed MERS-CoV infection and asymptomatic positive contacts.

Methods
Data from repeated laboratory testing of respiratory samples received at the Saudi Arabian virology reference laboratory in Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from [1 Sep 2012-30 Sep 2013] were recorded. A real-time RT-PCR test for MERS-CoV was used. Data were analyzed by origin of sample, sample type, and MERS-CoV PCR test results.

Results
26 individuals (13 patients and 13 contacts) had repeated testing done until a negative test was obtained. Most samples from MERS-CoV cases were tracheal aspirate/sputum (p = 0.0006) and most samples from contacts were nose and throat swabs (p = 0.0002). Kaplan-Meier curve analysis showed that contacts cleared the virus at a much earlier time than patients. On day 12, 30 per cent of contacts and 7 per cent of cases were still positive for MERS-CoV by PCR.

Conclusions
Contacts cleared MERS-CoV earlier than ill patients. This finding could be related to the types of sample as well as the types of patient studied. More ill patients with significant comorbidities shed the virus for a significantly longer time. The results of this study could have critical implications for infection control guidance and its application in healthcare facilities handling positive cases.

Summary
-------
Objectives
To report the experience with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection at a single center in Saudi Arabia.

Methods
Cases of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV occurring from [1 Oct 2012 2012 to 31 May 2014] were reviewed retrospectively. Information sources included medical files, infection control outbreak investigations, and the preventive medicine database of MERS-CoV-infected patients. Data were collected on clinical and epidemiological aspects and outcomes.

Results
70 consecutive patients were included. Patients were mostly of older age (median 62 years), male (46, 65.7 per cent), and had healthcare acquisition of infection (39, 55.7 per cent). Fever (43, 61.4 per cent), dyspnea (42, 60 per cent), and cough (38, 54.3 per cent) were the most common symptoms. The majority developed pneumonia (63, 90 per cent) and required intensive care (49, 70 per cent). Infection commonly occurred in clusters. Independent risk factors for severe infection requiring intensive care included concomitant infections (odds ratio (OR) 14.13, 95 per cent confidence interval (CI) 1.58-126.09; p = 0.018) and low albumin (OR 6.31, 95 per cent CI 1.24-31.90; p = 0.026). Mortality was high (42, 60 per cent), and age 65 years or older was associated with mortality (OR 4.39, 95 per cent CI 2.13-9.05; p less than 0.001).

Conclusions
MERS-CoV can cause severe infection requiring intensive care and has a high mortality. Concomitant infections and low albumin were found to be predictors of severe infection, while age 65 years or older was the only predictor of mortality.

Abstract
--------
In a paper by Saad and co-workers in this issue of the International Journal of Infections Diseases reporting on 70 consecutive patients with MERS-CoV in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, KSA, 55 per cent (39/70) were defined as health care associated. Only one of the 70 had contact with camels within 2 weeks of onset of symptoms. The authors write that "Healthcare exposure to infection was the most important risk factor to develop MERS-CoV infection.".

[In the future, ProMED-mail will bring news of new papers in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases, IJID, with focus on infections causing an ongoing outbreak. This 1st posting highlights the importance of healthcare associated transmission of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia and an IJID editorial on the same subject. The papers are proofs available from Elsevier and not yet in PubMed. - Mod.EP

In the 1st article above, Ziad Memish and colleagues showed that MERS-CoV is identifiable by PCR in nasopharyngeal specimens from contacts of more severely ill individuals. This study is a good start in addressing the question of whether asymptomatic MERS-CoV infected individuals play a role in the transmission cycle of the virus to others. In addition, the authors showed that there was prolonged virus shedding in more severely ill individuals, although at day 12, 30 per cent of contacts were still found to have identifiable virus in upper respiratory specimens.

In the 2nd article, Mustafa Saad and colleagues studied 70 consecutive patients admitted to a single institution with a diagnosis of MERS-CoV. Only one had a history of camel exposure. Of the 70 cases, 44.3 per cent were identified as community acquired and 55.7 per cent were identified as nosocomially acquired. Of interest the authors identified 8 clusters of nosocomially acquired infection, ranging from 2 to 15 cases. The largest cluster (15 cases) involved transmission in the emergency department, with 10 cases acquiring the infection from a single patient (shown in Figure 2 at the source URL above). The authors also identified 2nd generation cases but only one incident of 3rd generation transmission. The authors give a detailed analysis of the clinical syndromes and complications, and while there is mention that 81.4 per cent of the cases had co-morbidities, information on types of co-morbidities were not described in detail. - Mod.MPP]
