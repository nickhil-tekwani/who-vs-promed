Brakes put on measures to curb bird flu; no need for alarming
message, says Thaksin
---------------------
Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra put the brakes on anti-bird flu
measures tabled for cabinet approval yesterday [15 Feb 2005] out of
concern that they could send an alarming message to the public and
other countries. Government spokesman Jakrapob Penkair said the prime
minister did not want to rush measures through without full
information.
The measures, proposed by Deputy Prime Minister Chaturon Chaisaeng,
include the slaughter of 10.7 million ducks and an emergency plan to
cope with the spread of bird flu and possible human-to-human
infection [see 20050212.0481].
A meeting of experts and business groups that would be affected would
be called next week [4th week of February 2005], the spokesman said.
A Government House source said the prime minister withdrew the
proposal from consideration, because he was concerned that the
cabinet's stamp of approval, particularly the human-to-human
infection measures, could send a wrong signal that Thailand had
already had such problems. "We still have time to carefully consider
the measures," Mr. Thaksin was quoted as telling his cabinet
colleagues. "We can't afford to make mistakes, because
misunderstandings would be difficult to correct."
Mr. Thaksin was not too convinced by the information gathered by the
anti-bird flu committee chaired by Mr. Chaturon. The data from other
countries hit by the disease might not be applicable to the Thai
situation, he said. He also wanted more scientific studies and tests
into the possibility of human-to-human infection.
The prime minister also expressed doubt that it was appropriate to
slaughter the ducks when there was no clear proof that it was the
most effective way to curb bird flu. The mass culling would have a
big impact on poultry farmers, he said.

[The initial plan to cull about 2.7 million young free-range ducks
"in an effort to prevent further outbreaks and eradicate the virus
from the Kingdom (Thailand)" was described in posting 20050212.0481
and later included in the FAO review 20050216.0519. The (costly) plan
was to be discussed at Tuesday's [15 Feb 2005] cabinet meeting. The
current newswire, published subsequent to the said meeting,
illuminates the serious political and financial constraints involved.
