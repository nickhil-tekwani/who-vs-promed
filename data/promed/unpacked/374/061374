[Cases continue to be reported. In June 2016, there were a total of 46 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia, of whom 24 (52.2 percent) were asymptomatic infections identified in contacts of known MERS-CoV infected individuals, related to a nosocomial outbreak in Riyadh. 19 of the 46 (41.3 percent) newly confirmed infections were in healthcare workers, 18 in Riyadh, and 1 in Najran. Other areas reporting cases during June included Alaflaj, Alkharj, Baha, Dammam, Hufoof, Madinah Tabuk, (1 case each), Taif (2), Najran (2), Jeddah (3). A total of 13 of the 46 newly reported cases were classified as primary cases, the remaining 33 were classified as secondary contact cases.

Please note that it has been difficult to reconcile the actual number of active cases and active asymptomatic infections due to differing reporting information on case outcomes (fatalities and recoveries) than presented in the initial confirmation reports, perhaps reflecting a transferring of a patient from one hospital to another (in a different province), or a correction in age learned during the investigation, etc. Hence, I apologize if there appears to be erroneous or inconsistent information presented in the updates that we've been publishing.
