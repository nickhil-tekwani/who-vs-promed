Chronic wasting disease found in a white-tailed deer in Maryland
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) received
laboratory confirmation on 10 Feb 2011 that a white-tailed deer
harvested in Maryland tested positive for chronic wasting disease
(CWD). This is the 1st confirmed case of CWD in Maryland. A hunter in
Allegany County reported taking the deer on 27 Nov 2010 in Green Ridge
State Forest. Maryland joins 20 other states and Canadian provinces
with CWD documented in deer, elk or moose.

"Our team of wildlife professionals has been preparing for this
result for some time so we are well-informed and ready to limit the
impact of this event," said Paul Peditto, director of DNR's Wildlife
and Heritage Service. "We have sampled intensively for this disease
since 2002 and see this as an unfortunate but somewhat inevitable
outcome. The good news is that our preparation and planning ensure a
sound scientific foundation for our response to this single positive
test result. With the continued cooperation of hunters, farmers, deer
processors and landowners who have supported our monitoring effort, we
will manage this deer disease consistent with the best available
science and with minimal impact on our deer population and the people
who enjoy these great animals."

"Concerns over CWD should not stop anyone from enjoying venison,"
added Peditto, who explained that only 4 species of the deer family
are known to be susceptible to CWD: elk, mule deer, moose and
white-tailed deer. Of these, only the white-tailed deer occurs in the
wild in Maryland and there are no reported cases of transmission to
humans or other animals.

As always, hunters are advised to exercise caution and never consume
the meat of sick animals. Hunters are also advised to avoid contact
with the brain, spinal column or lymph nodes of deer -- all of which
are normally removed during the butchering process.

This is the 1st positive sample out of nearly 6800 deer tested in
Maryland since 1999. From 2002 until 2009 that sampling occurred
statewide. In 2010, sampling efforts were focused on Allegany and
western Washington counties due to the presence of positive cases in
nearby West Virginia and Virginia. West Virginia 1st detected CWD in
Hampshire County in 2005 and it was found in Frederick County,
Virginia in early 2010.

"Maryland will continue to work closely with the wildlife
professionals in our adjacent states to share information and
coordinate response efforts. However, our primary goal is to ensure
the public is fully informed and knows what we know when we know it.
We want to be certain that every interested Marylander understands
this disease and recognizes that there is no risk to people, pets or
domestic livestock. As in every other state with CWD, we will respond
appropriately while ultimately learning to live with this disease with
little impact to our wildlife or citizens," Peditto concluded.

[This represents an expansion of the disease, but Maryland seems to
be surrounded by it, and so it was only a matter of time as diseases
have no respect for borders.

However, Maryland is to be commended for not over-reacting to a
disease that has been in the US for many decades now.

The warning for hunters is appropriate. Continued surveillance is
appropriate. We hope your case rate remains low. - Mod.TG
