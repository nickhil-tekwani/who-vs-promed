Human Avian Influenza, Jiangsu Province, Dog Bite
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Jiangsu Provincial Health Bureau announced on the night of Sun 2
Dec 2007 that the Ministry of Health had confirmed a human case of
highly pathogenic avian influenza in Jiangsu, and that [the patient]
had died in hospital that day due to multiple organ failure.

In an exclusive interview with Health Times, Professor Yin Kaisheng,
attending physician for the fatal Nanjing avian influenza case,
Ministry of Health national public health emergency response
specialist, and official in charge of the Jiangsu Province Health
Bureau's Human Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Prevention Medical
Treatment Team, stated that, for the moment, it is not possible for a
SARS-like super-spreader to emerge, transmitting avian influenza from
one person to the masses. Residents don't need to panic.

Yin Kaisheng revealed that during this patient's hospitalization
there was no way to confirm [he had] avian influenza. It was the
Jiangsu Center for Disease Control's laboratory that detected that
the infection was H5N1 type avian influenza virus. Moreover, the
patient always maintained that he had no way [to contract] this
infection, and had no history of contact with poultry. It is only
known that 20 days before becoming ill [he] had been bitten by a dog,
and 20 days later [he] developed fever after drinking a little alcohol.

[The patient who died on Sun 2 Dec 2007 is presumed to be the
24-year-old man who had developed a fever and pneumonia symptoms on
Mon 3 Dec 2007. Later this man's 52-year-old father was was admitted
to hospital and was also confirmed H5N1-positive. He remains alive.
Neither father nor son are known to have had contact with diseased
fowl, but the matter is still being investigated.

Notwithstanding the father-son relationship of these 2 cases in
Jiangsu province it is premature to consider this to be an instance
of human-to-human transmission in view of the lack of information on
the source of the virus, and the absence of onward transmission. The
suggestion that the 24-year-old man's infection might be relate to a
dog bite (and/or alcohol!) is intriguing. Although domestic and wild
felines are know to be highly susceptible to H5N1 virus infection,
dogs are less so (see: Current outbreak of H5N1 in birds and other animals;
<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/avianflu/biofacts/avflu_human.html#_Summary_of_Avian_Influenza_in_Human>).


However it is possible that dogs in their role as scavengers could
mechanically transmit bird flu virus by biting. The 20-day lapse
between bite and onset of illness in this case makes this route of
transmission of disease unlikely, and there would still have to
reservoir of infected wild birds or domestic poultry in the area.
Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP]
