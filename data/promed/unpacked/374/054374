Between 1 Aug and 5 Nov 2019, Nigeria experienced an upsurge in cases of yellow fever, with 511 suspected cases in 3 states: 309 from Katsina, 162 from Bauchi, and 40 from Benue. Of the samples tested from these cases, 83 were confirmed positive (43 in Katsina, 34 in Bauchi, and 6 in Benue).

Since the beginning of the year [2019], the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) have been working with development partners to support the states to prevent and reduce the number of cases and deaths.

This year [2019], Katsina state has recorded 599 suspected cases, 43 confirmed cases, and 77 deaths among suspected cases. A mass vaccination campaign was carried out in the state in September 2019. Bauchi state has been reporting suspected cases of yellow fever mostly in Alkaleri LGA [local government area]. This year [2019], the state has recorded 183 suspected cases, 34 confirmed cases, and 24 deaths among suspected cases. Following the outbreak in Alkaleri LGA, a reactive vaccination campaign was carried out. Benue state has recorded 150 suspected cases, 6 confirmed cases, and no deaths in 2019. Vaccination campaigns have been carried out in 3 LGAs of the state this year [2019]: Vandekiya LGA in January 2019 and Oju and Ado LGAs in September 2019.

In response to the increase in cases, a multi-agency yellow fever emergency operations centre (EOC) was activated on 5 Nov 2019. Three rapid response teams (RRTs) have been deployed to Katsina, Bauchi, and Benue this week [week of Mon 4 Nov 2019] to support the outbreak response.

Working together, NPHCDA, NCDC, and development partners recently implemented yellow fever mass vaccination campaigns in Alkaleri LGA of Bauchi, 2 LGAs of Benue (Oju and Ado), and all the LGAs in Katsina. All the campaigns were implemented between September and October 2019. In total, yellow fever vaccination campaigns have been implemented in 13 of the 36 states in Nigeria and in the FCT.

Since the re-emergence of yellow fever in Nigeria in 2017, NCDC, NPHCDA, and the National Arbovirus and Vector Research Centre (NAVRC) have been working together to support states to investigate each case and respond to outbreaks.

Yellow fever virus is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. There is no human-to-human transmission of the virus. Yellow fever is a completely vaccine-preventable disease, and a single shot of the yellow fever vaccine protects for a lifetime. In Nigeria, vaccination against yellow fever is primarily through the routine childhood immunisation. Where necessary, catch-up campaigns are carried out to increase population immunity. The yellow fever vaccine is available for free in all primary healthcare centres in Nigeria as part of the routine childhood immunisation schedule. We encourage every family to ensure that children receive all their childhood vaccines.

In addition to the vaccine, the public is advised to keep their environment clean and free of stagnant water to discourage the breeding of mosquitoes and ensure the consistent use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets, screens on windows, and doors to prevent access for mosquitoes. Hikers, park visitors, and people engaged with activities in the wild especially are encouraged to be vaccinated against yellow fever. It is important to avoid self-medication; visit a health facility immediately if you feel ill.

Healthcare workers and members of the public are reminded that the symptoms of yellow fever include yellowness of the eyes, sudden fever, headache, and body pain. If you have these symptoms or notice someone in your community displaying them, please contact your nearest primary healthcare centre.

[Yellow fever cases have been occurring in various states across Nigeria this year (2019), most recently in the 3 above states. There is no indication in the above report what proportions of the population have been vaccinated in these 3 states, but clearly it is less than the ideal of 80-90%, given these cases. One hopes that the ongoing vaccinations will bring these outbreaks to a halt. - Mod.TY
