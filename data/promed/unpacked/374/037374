In Berlin, the animal disease Q fever was transmitted from sheep to laboratory staff in the summer [2021]. Up to 15 cases of infection are known to be counted in this outbreak, said Silvia Kostner, spokeswoman for the State Office for Health and Social Affairs on Friday [24 Sep 2021] and confirmed media reports. Q fever can be associated with flu-like symptoms in humans, but it can also lead to complications.

Larger outbreaks like this are rare in Berlin, said Kostner. In this case, the infection process was quickly recognized and also ended. "At no time was there a risk to the general population," added the spokeswoman. The latest human illness known to the office was at the end of July [2021].

According to the definition of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), Q fever is a zoonosis that is widespread almost worldwide - i.e., a disease that can be transmitted from animals to humans. It is caused by a bacterium called _Coxiella burnetii_. Ticks play a role in spreading among animals. The symptoms in animals are often ambiguous, and the disease is not fatal for them.

According to the RKI, about half of the cases lead to a flu-like illness if it is transmitted to humans - for example via the air or animal excretions. It can be complicated by inflammation of the lungs, liver, heart muscle, or brain. Chronic disease courses, mainly heart valve inflammation, are very rare, but feared because of the severity of the disease.

People who have close contact with animals -- for example animal keepers, butchers, veterinary and laboratory staff -- are particularly at risk. In Berlin there have been only a few cases of Q fever being transmitted to humans each year since 2016. In 2020 there were 3 cases, 2019 (2), 2018 (7), 2017 (4), and 2016 (4). Nationwide, the numbers fluctuate greatly. Since 2001 there have been between 55 and 416 registered illnesses per year with no discernible trend.

Q fever is an infection caused by _Coxiella burnetii_, an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterial pathogen. It is highly resistant to drying and heat, which enables the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment. Its survival is attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of its biphasic developmental cycle.

Q fever is a zoonosis. Domestic ungulates such as sheep, cattle, and goats serve as the reservoir of infection for humans. The organism is shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta.

Humans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms. Acute symptoms of a flu-like illness usually develop within 2-3 weeks of exposure, although as many as half of humans infected with _C. burnetii_ do not show symptoms (http://www.cdc.gov/qfever/symptoms/index.html). Although most persons with acute Q fever infection recover, others may develop chronic infection, including endocarditis (especially in patients with previous cardiac valvulopathy), chronic hepatitis, chronic vascular infections (especially in patients with vascular grafts or arterial aneurysms), osteomyelitis, osteoarthritis, and chronic pulmonary infections. Pregnant women who are infected may be at risk for pre-term delivery or miscarriage and chronic infection. Chronic Q fever is rare, occurring in less than 5% of persons with acute infection, occurring within a few months to decades after the initial symptomatic or asymptomatic infection. Post-Q fever fatigue syndrome has been reported in up to 20% of patients with acute Q fever.

Q fever is distributed worldwide, with the exception of New Zealand (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/9/1/01-0305_article). Q fever is primarily an occupational hazard for farmers, veterinarians, and abattoir workers in contact with domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats and for laboratory personnel performing _C. burnetii_ cultures and working with _C. burnetii_-infected animals (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88923/). Sporadic cases occur in people living in urban areas that are downwind from farms or abattoirs where the organisms have become aerosolized. Occasional cases follow contact with farm animals or after contact with infected pets such as dogs and cats.

Q fever is endemic in Germany (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/7/5/01-0504_article). A Q fever outbreak occurred in Canadian and US travelers to Germany, where they received live sheep cell therapy in 2014 by the same German physician. (See the following ProMED posts in the see alsos below:

Q fever - Germany: (RP) sheep cell therapy, 2014 20170416.4974554.)

Live cell therapy, not available in the US, involves injecting processed cells from organs or fetuses of nonhuman animals (for example, sheep) into human recipients to treat a variety of health conditions. At the time of the Q fever outbreak in the Canadian and U.S. recipients of live sheep cell therapy in 2014, an outbreak of human Q fever was being investigated by German authorities associated with a sheep flock that was used for production of fetal sheep cell injections by the German physician.

The circumstances by which Q fever was transmitted from sheep to "up to 15" laboratory staff in Berlin this past summer [2021] is not described in the news report above. Nor are we told the clinical status of the infected laboratory personnel. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
