In all, 886 animals have got infected with lumpy skin disease (LSD) and 22 head of cattle have died in Muktsar till 30 Jul 2022. LSD symptoms include fever, nodules on skin, watery eyes and increased nasal and salivary secretions in cattle.

Ironically, the district animal husbandry office has just Rs 25 000 [USD 314.66] to take precautionary measures. Animal Husbandry, Fisheries and Dairy Development minister Laljit Singh Bhullar on Monday [1 Aug 2022] instructed veterinary staff to intensify the campaign to tackle contagious lumpy skin disease. The district-level teams have been formed to protect the livestock. A team from North Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, Jalandhar, is also visiting the affected areas.

The cases are mainly reported in Fazilka, Muktsar, Moga and Faridkot districts. An additional amount of Rs 50 000 [USD 629.65] has been allocated for Fazilka and other districts.

Veterinary doctors and inspectors were relying entirely on symptomatic treatment. Further, the single-shot "goat pox" vaccine to tackle LSD causes prolonged morbidity in cows and buffaloes. Notably, the district has 105 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries, including a district-level polyclinic at Badal village. The district also has 19 cattle pounds and the total count of cattle stands at 229 200.

Some dairy farmers said they were paying heavy fees to private doctors as the state-run hospitals and dispensaries were not having the required vaccine. "We are running from pillar to post to buy medicines. Private doctors are charging exorbitant fees. On one hand, the rain has damaged our standing crops and, on the other, the LSD has increased our losses," said a farmer.

A dairy farmer from Sarainaga village, said, "Due to the LSD, milk production has reduced by 30%. Further, nearly 10 to 15% of the cows are infected. Six head of cattle have died at my dairy due to the LSD and 15 more are infected. First case was detected around a month [July 2022] ago at my farm, but the department concerned did nothing."

Meanwhile, Jagpal Singh Abulkhurana, general secretary, Pradesh Congress Committee, said: "A number of dairy farmers from Lambi have apprised me of the situation. The Animal Husbandry Department is not even having funds to tackle this rapidly spreading disease. The state government should immediately release funds, procure vaccine and launch a massive vaccination drive."

Jagsir Singh, deputy director, Animal Husbandry Department, Muktsar, said, "Nearly 900 animals got infected with the LSD in the district. Most of them have recovered. A total of 22 deaths have been reported so far. We don't have the vaccine and are short of medicines. We are giving symptomatic treatment to the infected animals. Dairy farmers should not panic. We are holding awareness camps in the villages."

Another senior official of the Animal Husbandry Department said, "The LSD cases have been detected throughout the state. As of now, 9000 animals are symptomatic and 46 head of cattle have died. As the post-mortem of animals was not conducted, we can't say how many cattle died due to the LSD."

[Since its initial introduction into India in late 2019, LSD has been reported to spread and seriously affect cattle in the following 8 Indian states, most of them in the north: Odisha, Kerala, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Assam, Maharashtra, Gujarat and, most recently, Rajasthan. LSD virus may have already been circulating elsewhere in India. The addition of Punjab is not surprising: the virus had been circulating in the neighboring Pakistani province of Punjab for more than 8 months. Clinical cases were initially reported to Pakistan's State Veterinary Services on 27 Oct 2021 from Bahawalpur region of Punjab province (https://wahis.woah.org/#/report-info?reportId=49953). The disease has spread further.

Biosecurity measures should be combined with methodical application of vaccination, which is essential to stop further spread of LSD and to minimise losses. At present, only live attenuated vaccines against LSD are commercially available, globally. To safeguard the safety and efficacy of the vaccine, only registered, officially approved batches should be used.

A list of the 11 most commonly used vaccines registered for use in cattle against LSD, is presented in Table 1 of the following paper: Tuppurainen E, Dietze K, Wolff J, Bergmann H, et al. Review: vaccines and vaccination against lumpy skin disease. Vaccines 2021, 9, 1136. https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9101136. - Mod.AS
