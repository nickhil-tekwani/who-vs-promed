Outbreak of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in Iran
---------------------------------------------------
TEHRAN: A deadly virus has infected 30 per cent of Iran's cattle stock and
killed 20 people since last year, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
(IRNA) reported on Fri 24 May 2002. Mohammad Mehdi Gouya, the head of the
Disease Management Center of the Health Ministry, was quoted as saying that
the 20 people who died were among more than 140 people diagnosed as
suffering from Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever.
Health officials have warned that a new outbreak was possible with hot
weather coinciding with the return of Muslim pilgrims from the annual haj
[pilgrimage] to Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Relatives of pilgrims slaughter cattle
and distribute meat among neighbors, IRNA said. Health officials say
spilled blood from slaughtered cattle can cause infections.
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever was first detected in the north eastern
Khorassan province in 1978 after entering Iran through imported cattle from
eastern states. The fever broke out in Pakistan and Afghanistan -- Iran's
eastern neighbors -- earlier this year. Doctors said 3 people died then.
The virus causing Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever -- which is found in
Africa, Asia, and eastern Europe -- is transmitted by ticks, which thrive
on sheep and cattle. Infected people can transmit the virus by blood,
saliva or droplets from sneezing. The disease causes a sharp drop in
platelet, which allow the blood to clot. Without rapid antiviral drug
treatment [intravenous ribavirin and convalescent plasma with a high
neutralising antibody titer are regarded as useful, according to Benenson,
1995. - Mod.SH] and platelet replacements, victims can bleed to death.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever occurs sporadically in China, Central
Asia, eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. In recent years there
have been small outbreaks of disease in countries bordering the Persian
Gulf in connection with traditional sheep slaughtering and butchering
practices. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus is a bunyavirus belonging
to the genus _Nairovirus_, which is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. and
related ticks. There is no evidence that there is any clinical disease in
animals other than humans, but infection in domestic animals puts the human
population at risk. There is no vaccine and protection is best achieved by
control of the vector and by strict attention to hygiene for those coming
into contact with wild and domestic ruminants. - Mod.CP]
