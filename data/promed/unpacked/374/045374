[This is a further update from Tonga -- Many thanks to both Tonga Director
of Health and WHO/CLO -- TK].
The Director of Health, Tonga, has today (20 March 1998) released the
following information:

Since January 1998 there has been a total of 131 suspected cases of dengue
fever in Tonga. Testing for antibodies has confirmed 15 serologically
(IgM) positive of 75 specimens, representing 20% of the samples tested.

There were 44 admissions since January of suspected dengue fever to Vaiola
Hospital in Nuku'alofa. There were no serious DHF cases, no DSS cases, and
no deaths. Only one case of suspected dengue fever has been reported from
an outer island, 'Eua.
The Ministry of Health is continuing with targetted mosquito control, in
particular breeding sites, and public education.
