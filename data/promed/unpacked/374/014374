More than 450 000 people all over the country have been diagnosed with diarrhea. Of them, more than 55 000 patients have been treated at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDRB). Some 23% of the patients admitted at the ICCDRB have severe diarrhea or cholera.

According to the ICCDRB and the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), diarrhea patients are common. However, the number of patients this year [2022] is higher than in previous years.

Speaking to Prothom Alo on Sunday [3 Apr 2022], the director of the Communicative Disease Control (CDC) unit of the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) said, "The incidence of diarrhea is a bit higher than normal. It has become a matter of concern." The health emergency operation center and the control room of DGHS have given a figure on the number of diarrhea patients across the country from January 2022 to March 2022. According to that figure, a total of 461 611 diarrhea patients were treated at hospitals; 2 of them died.

The highest numbers of diarrhea cases have been reported in Dhaka division, where a total of 159 247 people contracted diarrhea. The number of infected is the lowest in Barishal division. The number of infected patients in Mymensingh and Rangpur division was lower in March 2022 than in February 2022. The number of diarrhea patients has increased in the remaining divisions.

However, the people concerned say the real number of diarrhea patients is higher than the assessment of the DGHS. The DGHS only keeps account of the patients admitted to government hospitals and ICCDRB's hospital in Mohakhali. A number of patients seek treatment at physicians' private chambers, and many do not go to physicians in the event of normal diarrhea. They simply buy oral saline from the pharmacies instead of going to doctors.

More than 1000 patients have been admitted to the hospital of ICDDRB on daily basis since 16 Mar [2022]. In the first 11 hours of Sunday [3 Apr 2022], as many as 402 patients were admitted there. The hospital was crowded with patients, their relatives, physicians, nurses, other health workers, and security guards. Sometimes 4 or 5 patients were seen coming together. The patients were of all ages. In the case of a few patients, it was observed that they were being put to bed without the registration process. Even their treatment started without completing the registration process as they were critically ill. The number of patients admitted to the hospital rose 488 by 12:00 pm. That means that some 86 patients were admitted in one hour.

As the number of newly admitted patients was high, so was the number of patients recovering. Authorities say 80% of patients are being sent home within 24 hours of admission. All the patients of this hospital are being treated free of cost.

Prof Tahmid Ahmed, executive director of ICDDRB, visited the hospital before 12:00 pm. He told Prothom Alo that the health directorate has been informed about the increase in the incidence of diarrhea since the beginning of March [2022]. Asked if ICCDRB has taken any initiative to test the water in Dhaka, Tahmid Ahmed said, "We have contacted Dhaka WASA in this regard. We have suggested them increase the amount of chlorine in water."

IEDCR has sent 2 teams of health workers in Barguna and Narsingdi to identify the reason behind the diarrhea outbreak. Speaking to Prothom Alo, Prof Tahmina Shirin, director of IEDCR, said that they have also taken initiatives to test the water at certain places apart from those 2 districts. The results of tests would be sent to the disease control unit soon.

In March [2022], a total of 29 681 patients were admitted to the hospital of ICCDRB. Of them, some 23%, or 6826, were cholera patients.

According to ICCDRB, initiatives should be taken to create awareness among the people, water should be used after boiling to avoid diarrhea, people should avoid eating uncovered food near the streets, people should wash their hands with soap before and after eating, and children should not be fed with feeders. In case of diarrhea, one packet of saline should be mixed in half a liter of water, the patient should be given more liquid food in addition to saline, and the patient should not be given soft drinks or fruit juice or grapes.

[This outbreak continues to increase in Bangladesh. It is reported that some of these cases are due to _Vibrio cholerae_ but, with a reported case fatality rate of 2/461 611 (case fatality rate (<0.0004%), it is likely that most of the cases are not cholera, whose CFR is generally several logarithms [or orders of magnitude. - Mod.SH] higher than that. - Mod.LL
