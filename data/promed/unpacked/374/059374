Officials say 8 patients at Nanaimo [Regional] General Hospital [NRGH] are
currently infected with the _Clostridium difficile_ bacterium. Vancouver
Island Health Authority spokeswoman Lesley Moss said on Friday [29 Aug
2008] that a total of 57 people have become ill since April. She said there
are usually 2 to 3 cases in such a period. "As of Aug. 22, we have 8
confirmed cases in the hospital," Moss said. [As of 29 Aug 2008, 10
patients remain in the hospital
(<http://www.bclocalnews.com/news/27670654.html>).] A total of 3 people
have died since June 2008.

"The elderly are far more vulnerable than anybody else." Moss said if the
infection is caught early enough, patients respond well to treatment. The
infected patients have been segregated from other patients and are treated
by staff in gowns and gloves, she said. "We have increased our infection
control measures in the hospital in order to help control this disease,"
Moss said. "They're responding well to treatment and will be discharged
home when they meet discharge criteria."

Moss said it's not clear where the patients contracted the illness. "We
don't know if they came in with it or if they contracted it in the
facility," she said. "Lots of the general population have this bacteria
growing in their intestine and when they start on antibiotics for different
reasons this bacteria then flares up. "We don't know who has it before they
get the symptoms of the disease."

The _C. difficile_ bacterium is commonly found in hospitals and long term
care facilities. It can be spread through contact with surfaces by people
who have not washed their hands after using the bathroom, Moss said. The
infection causes swelling and irritation of the large intestine and
symptoms can include diarrhea, fever and cramps. Moss said the hospital is
being thoroughly cleaned. [Moss said epidemiologists with the BC Centre for
Disease Control were at NRGH for the entire week reviewing charts, touring
the hospital and examining patient flow and transmission in an attempt to
determine how the bacteria spread

[The news report does not say if the _C. difficile_ isolates from the 57
Nanaimo patients are genetically related, or if they are indeed
_Clostridium difficile_ ribotype 027, which characteristically
hyper-produce toxin and cause diarrhea and colitis that is associated with
increased morbidity, mortality, and poor response to antimicrobial therapy.
This particular ribotype 027 is characteristically resistant to
fluoroquinolones, the use of which is a risk factor for acquisition of _C.
difficile_-associated diarrhea and colitis due to ribotype 027.

From a prior ProMED-mail post -- Clostridium difficile, ribotype 027 - UK:
(N. Ireland) 20080207.0498:
"_Clostridium difficile_ is the most common cause of bacterial diarrhea and
pseudomembranous colitis in hospitalized patients, and antimicrobial drug
therapy is the most important risk factor associated with the acquisition
of _C. difficile_.

"Preventing the spread of _C. difficile_ in health care facilities involves
clinical and microbiologic surveillance of hospitalized patients with
diarrhea for _C. difficile_ and heightened infection control measures,
including prompt isolation of patients with _C. difficile_-positive
diarrhea or cohorting, where isolation rooms are not available, combined
with particular emphasis on hand hygiene and control of the inappropriate
use of antimicrobial agents
(<http://www.shea-online.org/Assets/files/position_papers/Cldiff95.PDF>)."

Nanaimo, with a population of about 80 000 residents, is located on the
east coast of Vancouver Island, 55 km across the Strait of Georgia from
city of Vancouver, British Columbia (see map at
<http://www.cityofnanaimo.com/>). Nanaimo is the second largest city on
Vancouver Island. Vancouver Island, about the same size as Holland, is the
largest North American Island in the Pacific Ocean. - Mod.ML]
