Typhoid has claimed 5 lives and infected some 200 others, mostly
children, in Afghanistan's central Ghor province over the past 10
days, a local newspaper reported Wed 14 Feb 2007.
The epidemic broke out in Charsada district 10 days ago, and a team
of doctors has been sent to the area to control it, daily Outlook
quoted the director of the provincial Health Department Abdul Qayum
Paknijad as saying.

An Auckland senior health professional is warning those who travel to
the Pacific to get vaccinated for typhoid. Dr. Greg Simmons, from the
Auckland Regional Health Board, says the current strain of typhoid
cases seems to have come from the Pacific Islands, especially Samoa.
He says health authorities in Samoa and New Zealand are working
together to curb any further cases and are warning travelers to take
caution.
Typhoid is becoming a problem in Fiji too, with a danger that the
number of typhoid cases there could increase because of the recent
floods. Northern Fiji's director for health, Dr. Ami Chand, says
they're also watching out for cases of diarrhea and food poisoning,
but typhoid is the priority.
