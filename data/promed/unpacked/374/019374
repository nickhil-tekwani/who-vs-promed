[1] Inequality in vaccine distribution
Date: Sun 9 May 2021

At the small hospital where Dr. Oumaima Djarma works in Chad's capital, there are no debates over which coronavirus vaccine is the best.

There are simply no vaccines at all.

Not even for the doctors and nurses like her, who care for COVID-19 patients in Chad, one of the least-developed nations in the world where about one 3rd of the country is engulfed by the Sahara desert.

"I find it unfair and unjust, and it is something that saddens me," the 33-year-old infectious diseases doctor says. "I don't even have that choice. The 1st vaccine that comes along that has authorization, I will take it."

While wealthier nations have stockpiled vaccines for their citizens, many poorer countries are still scrambling to secure doses. A few, like Chad, have yet to receive any. The World Health Organization says nearly a dozen countries -- many of them in Africa -- are still waiting to get vaccines. Those last in line on the continent along with Chad are Burkina Faso, Burundi, Eritrea and Tanzania.

"Delays and shortages of vaccine supplies are driving African countries to slip further behind the rest of the world in the COVID-19 vaccine rollout and the continent now accounts for only 1% of the vaccines administered worldwide," WHO warned [Thu 6 May 2021].

And in places where there are no vaccines, there's also the chance that new and concerning variants could emerge, said Gian Gandhi, UNICEF's COVAX coordinator for Supply Division. "So we should all be concerned about any lack of coverage anywhere in the world," Gandhi said, urging higher-income countries to donate doses to the nations that are still waiting.

While the total of confirmed COVID-19 cases among them is relatively low compared with the world's hot spots, health officials say that figure is likely a vast undercount. The countries in Africa still waiting for vaccines are among those least equipped to track infections because of their fragile health care systems.

Chad has confirmed only 170 deaths since the pandemic began, but efforts to stop the virus entirely here have been elusive. Although the capital's international airport was closed briefly last year [2020], its first case came via someone who crossed one of Chad's porous land borders illegally. Regular flights from Paris and elsewhere have resumed, heightening the chance of increasing the 4835 already confirmed cases.

The Farcha provincial hospital in N'Djamena is a gleaming new campus in an outlying neighborhood, where camels nibble from acacia trees nearby. Doctors Without Borders has helped supply oxygen for COVID-19 patients, and the hospital has 13 ventilators. The physicians also have plenty of Chinese-made KN95 masks and hand sanitizer. Still, not a single employee has been vaccinated and none has been told when that might be possible.

That was easier to accept at the beginning of the pandemic, Djarma said, because doctors all around the world lacked vaccines. That has changed dramatically after the development of shots in the West and by China and Russia that have gone to other poor African countries. "When I hear, for example, in some countries that they've finished with medical staff and the elderly and are now moving on to other categories, honestly, it saddens me," Djarma said. "I ask them if they can provide us with these vaccines to at least protect the health workers."

"Everyone dies from this disease, rich or poor," she says. "Everyone must have the opportunity, the chance to be vaccinated, especially those who are most exposed."

COVAX, the U.N.-backed program to ship COVID-19 vaccines worldwide, is aimed at helping low- and middle-income countries get access. A few of the countries, though, including Chad, have expressed concerns about receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine through COVAX for fear it might not protect as well against a variant 1st seen in South Africa. Chad is expected to get some Pfizer doses next month [June 2021] if it can put in place the cold storage facilities needed to keep that vaccine safe in a country where temperatures soar each day to 43.5 deg. Celsius (110 deg. Fahrenheit).

Some of the last countries also took more time to meet the requirements for receiving doses, including signing indemnity waivers with manufacturers and having distribution plans in place. Those delays, though, now mean an even longer wait for places like Burkina Faso, since a key vaccine manufacturer in India scaled back its global supply because of the catastrophic virus surge there.

"Now with global vaccine supply shortages, stemming in particular from the surge of cases in India and subsequently the Indian government's sequestration of doses from manufacturers there, Burkina Faso risks even longer delays in receiving the doses it was slated to get," said Donald Brooks, CEO of a U.S. aid group engaged in the COVID-19 response there known as Initiative: Eau.

Front-line health workers in Burkina Faso say they're not sure why the government hasn't secured vaccines. "We would have liked to have had it like other colleagues around the world," says Chivanot Afavi, a supervising nurse who worked on the front lines of the response until recently. "No one really knows what this disease will do to us in the future."

In Haiti, not a single vaccine has been administered to the more than 11 million people who live in the most impoverished country of the Western hemisphere. Haiti was slated to receive 756 000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine via COVAX, but government officials said they didn't have the infrastructure needed to conserve them and worried about having to throw them away. Haitian officials also expressed concerns over potential side effects and said they preferred a single-dose vaccine.

Several small island nations in the Pacific also have yet to receive any vaccine, although the lack of outbreaks in some of those places has meant there is less urgency with inoculation campaigns. Vanuatu, with a population of 300 000, is waiting to receive its 1st doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine later this month [May 2021], but it has recorded only 3 cases of coronavirus, all of them in quarantine.

At the Farcha hospital in Chad, 9 health care workers have gotten the virus, including Dr. Mahamat Yaya Kichine, a cardiologist. The hospital now has set up pods of health care worker teams to minimize the risk of exposure for the entire staff. "It took almost 14 days for me to be cured," Kichine says. "There were a lot of caregivers that were infected, so I think that if there is a possibility to make a vaccine available, it will really ease us in our work."

[According to NPR, there are 12 countries still waiting for vaccine. Also read: https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/global-covid-19-vaccine-access-snapshot-of-inequality/

"... although high-income countries only account for 19% of the global adult population, collectively, they have purchased more than half (54%, or 4.6 billion) of global vaccine doses purchased to date. Of the remaining doses, 33% have been purchased by LMICs, who account for 81% of the global adult population; an additional 13% have been purchased by COVAX. Looking by country income group, the largest disparity between doses purchased and population share is for lower-middle-income countries (37% of the global population vs. 12% of purchased doses, or 989 million doses), followed closely by upper-middle-income countries (37% vs. 18%, or 1.5 billion doses). The disparity for low-income countries is smaller (3% vs. 7%, or 263 million doses) (see Figure 1a at URL above).

"The disparity between vaccines purchased and country income level is significant but could be addressed in large part through redistribution of doses, as some high-income countries have said they would do. However, such a strategy is highly dependent on the as-of-yet unknown outcomes of several vaccine candidate trials or a significant increase in the manufacturing and production of already authorized vaccines." - Mod.LK]

[2] India: Mucormycosis
Date: Sun 9 May 2021
Source: BBC [abridged, edited]
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-57027829


On [Sat 8 May 2021] morning, Dr. Akshay Nair, a Mumbai-based eye surgeon, was waiting to operate on a 25-year-old woman who had recovered from a bout of Covid-19 3 weeks ago.

Inside the surgery, an ear, nose and throat specialist was already at work on the patient, a diabetic. He had inserted a tube in her nose and was removing tissues infected with mucormycosis, a rare but dangerous fungal infection. This aggressive infection affects the nose, eye and sometimes the brain. After his colleague finished, Dr. Nair would carry out a 3-hour procedure to remove the patient's eye. "I will be removing her eye to save her life. That's how this disease works," Dr. Nair told me.

Even as a deadly 2nd wave of Covid-19 ravages India, doctors are now reporting a rash of cases involving a rare infection - also called the "black fungus" - among recovering and recovered Covid-19 patients.

What is mucormycosis?
---------------------
Mucormycosis is a very rare infection. It is caused by exposure to mucor mould which is commonly found in soil, plants, manure, and decaying fruits and vegetables. "It is ubiquitous and found in soil and air and even in the nose and mucus of healthy people," says Dr. Nair.

It affects the sinuses, the brain and the lungs and can be life-threatening in diabetic or severely immunocompromised individuals, such as cancer patients or people with HIV/AIDS.

Doctors believe mucormycosis, which has an overall mortality rate of 50%, may be being triggered by the use of steroids, a life-saving treatment for severe and critically ill Covid-19 patients. Steroids reduce inflammation in the lungs for Covid-19 and appear to help stop some of the damage that can happen when the body's immune system goes into overdrive to fight off coronavirus. But they also reduce immunity and push up blood sugar levels in both diabetics and non-diabetic Covid-19 patients.

It's thought that this drop in immunity could be triggering these cases of mucormycosis. "Diabetes lowers the body's immune defences, coronavirus exacerbates it, and then steroids which help fight Covid-19 act like fuel to the fire," says Dr. Nair.

Dr. Nair - who works in 3 hospitals in Mumbai, one of the worst-hit cities in the 2nd wave - says he has already seen some 40 patients suffering from the fungal infection in April [2021]. Many of them were diabetics who had recovered from Covid-19 at home. Eleven of them had to have an eye surgically removed.

Between December [2020] and February [2021], just 6 of his colleagues in 5 cities - Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Delhi and Pune - reported 58 cases of the infection. Most of the patients contracted it between 12 and 15 days after recovery from Covid-19.

Mumbai's busy Sion Hospital has reported 24 cases of the fungal infection in the past 2 months, up from 6 cases a year, according to Dr. Renuka Bradoo, head of the hospital's ear, nose and throat wing. As many as 11 of them had to lose an eye, and 6 of them died. Most of her patients are middle-aged diabetics who were struck down by the fungus 2 weeks after recovering from Covid-19. "We are already seeing 2 to 3 cases a week here. It's a nightmare inside a pandemic," she told me.

In the southern city of Bengaluru, Dr. Raghuraj Hegde, an eye surgeon, tells a similar story. He has seen 19 cases of mucormycosis in the past 2 weeks, most of them young patients. "Some were so sick that we couldn't even operate on them."

Doctors say they are surprised by the severity and the frequency of this fungal infection during the 2nd wave, compared to some cases during the first wave last year. Dr. Nair says he has come across not more than 10 cases in Mumbai in the past 2 years. "This year is something different," he says. In Bengaluru, Dr Hegde had never seen more than 1 or 2 cases a year in over a decade of practice.

Patients suffering from the fungal infection typically have symptoms of stuffy and bleeding nose; swelling of and pain in the eye; drooping of eyelids; and blurred and finally, loss of vision. There could be black batches of skin around the nose.

Doctors say most of their patients arrive late, when they are already losing vision, and doctors have to surgically remove the eye to stop the infection from reaching the brain. In some cases, doctors in India say, patients have lost their vision in both eyes. And in rare cases, doctors have to surgically remove the jawbone in order to stop the disease from spreading.

An anti-fungal intravenous injection which costs 3500 rupees (USD 48) a dose and has to be administered every day up to 8 weeks is the only drug effective against the disease.

One way to stall the possibility of the fungal infection was to make sure that Covid-19 patients - both in treatment and after recovery - were being administered the right dose and duration of steroids, says Dr. Rahul Baxi, a Mumbai-based diabetologist. He says he treated some 800 diabetic Covid-19 patients in the past year [2020], and none of them contracted the fungal infection. "Doctors should take care of the sugar levels after the patients are discharged," Dr. Baxi told me.

A senior government official says there is "no big outbreak". Yet it is difficult to say why a growing number of cases of mucormycosis are being reported from all over the country. "The strain of the virus appears to be virulent, sending blood sugars soaring to very high levels. And strangely, the fungal infection is affecting a lot of young people," says Dr. Hegde. His youngest patient last month was a 27-year-old man, who was not even a diabetic. "We had to operate on him during his 2nd week of Covid-19 and remove his eye. It's pretty devastating."

[Mucormycosis is, to date, only being reported in India. ProMED requests information on whether other countries are also seeing this complication of COVID-19. It may be a matter of numbers, since the case load is so high in India that rare events will become evident. - Mod.LK]

[Mucormycosis (also called zygomycosis) is the name given to infections caused by _Mucorales_ (http://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/mucormycosis/). Pathogenic genera in the Mucoraceae family include _Absidia_, _Apophysomyces_, _Mucor_, _Rhizomucor_, and _Rhizopus_. These fungi are ubiquitous in the environment, such as in soil and decaying vegetable matter. Most human infections result from inhalation of fungal spores that have been released in the air or from direct inoculation of organisms into disrupted skin or mucosa. Although most individuals are exposed to these fungi daily, usually mucormycosis occurs in individuals with predisposing medical conditions such as immunosuppression and diabetic ketoacidosis. _Mucorales_ species are angioinvasive, causing infarction of the involved tissue, and the mucormycosis spectrum ranges from cutaneous, gastrointestinal, rhinocerebral, and sinopulmonary to disseminated and frequently fatal infections, especially in immunocompromised hosts.

Rhinocerebral mucormycosis extends from the nasal cavity to adjoining paranasal sinuses, the orbit, the retro-orbital area, and brain through bone erosion or through angioinvasion. A black eschar may be visible on nasal or palatal mucosa. Proptosis is the most common orbital sign with ophthalmoplegia and visual loss. Images of rhinocerebral mucormycosis can be found at https://bit.ly/2Q6xCjX.

The diagnosis of mucormycosis almost always requires histopathologic evidence of fungal invasion of the tissues. Culturing these organisms from an infected site is rarely sufficient to establish the diagnosis because the fungus may colonize tissue without causing infection and is a relatively frequent laboratory contaminant. - Mod.ML]

[3] Austria: test for children

Austria has come up with a COVID-19 test for children which is far less invasive and frightening than the long nose swab.

A test that looks like a small lollipop has been distributed to some kindergartens in the country. Kids will suck on the end for 90 seconds before the test is placed in a container. It takes 15 minutes to see the results from there.

Alas, the test does not come in any flavor. But it is far more comfortable for kids, especially as kindergartens prepare to re-open in the country.

Ref. Sonnleitner ST, Prelog M, Jansen B, et al. Maintenance of neutralizing antibodies over 10 months in convalescent SARS‐CoV‐2 afflicted patients. Transboundary and Emerging Diseases. First published: 07 May 2021. https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.14130

Abstract. Knowledge of the level and duration of protective immunity against SARS‐CoV‐2 after primary infection is of crucial importance for preventive approaches. Currently, there is a lack of evidence on the persistence of specific antibodies. We investigated the generation and maintenance of neutralizing antibodies of convalescent SARS‐CoV‐2‐afflicted patients over a 10‐month period post‐primary infection using an immunofluorescence assay, a commercial chemiluminescent immunoassay, and an in‐house enzyme‐linked neutralization assay.

We present the successful application of an improved version of the plaque‐reduction neutralization assay which can be analyzed optometrically to simplify data interpretation. Based on the results of the enzyme‐linked neutralization assay, neutralizing antibodies were maintained in 77.4% of convalescent individuals without relevant decay over 10 months. Furthermore, a positive correlation between severity of infection and antibody titer was observed.

In conclusion, SARS‐CoV‐2‐afflicted individuals have been proven to be able to develop and maintain neutralizing antibodies over a period of 10 months after primary infection. Findings suggest long‐lasting presumably protective humoral immune responses after wild‐type infection.

[There are many studies examining duration of IgG antibody following infection with SARS-CoV-2. The results vary from 3-4 months to more than 4 months to the study in the report above, 10 months. A study in China found that neutralizing antibody lasted in 405 of infected individuals 9 months:

"Chen Wang at Peking Union Medical College in Beijing and his colleagues took blood samples from more than 9500 people in some 3500 randomly selected households in Wuhan, China, the 1st place known to be widely affected by COVID-19 (Z. He et al. Lancet 397, 1075-1084; 2021). The team took samples at 3 separate times over the course of 2020: once in April, after the city's lockdown lifted; once in June; and again between October and December. The team tested the samples for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, which indicate that a person has been infected with the virus. The researchers found that only 7% of the population had been infected with the virus, of whom more than 80% had had no symptoms. Around 40% of the infected people produced neutralizing antibodies that could be detected for the entire study period [9 months]." (excerpted from https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00502-w).

As time goes on, we are getting a better picture of how long neutralizing antibody lasts and what titer is needed for protection against reinfection. - Mod.LK]
