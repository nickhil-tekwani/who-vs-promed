A total of 5 persons have died of an unidentified sickness in a
village in mid-western Dolpa district. Reports quoting local health
officials said several others have been infected with the disease in
Chharka village. The area is a 3-day walking distance from the
district headquarters, Dunai.

Those infected with the unknown disease complained of headache,
fever, and cough. Officials at the public health office at Dunai said
a team of medics left for the area on Sunday [15 Mar 2009] with
drugs, but they have not been able report back due to lack of means
of communication.

[The description of the symptoms of the disease is too limited to
permit a tentative diagnosis. Further information is requested from
the team of investigators dispatched to Chharka village, or from any
other informed source. Unfortunately, as revealed by the archive
material below, during the past decade reports of undiagnosed disease
in Nepal have been frequent without significant resolution.

Dolpa district can be located on the map of the districts of Nepal at
