South Korea officials said on Wednesday they were stepping up inspections of
imported Chinese freshwater fish after finding cancer-causing chemicals in
some fish sent from the country.
The Korea Food & Drug Administration (KFDA) said in a statement released on
Tuesday it had found the carcinogens malachite green and leucomalachite in
some imported Chinese carp available at a local wholesale market.
The KFDA said the fish were probably imported before 23 Aug 2005. The agency
had placed a quarantine on Chinese and Vietnamese eels since July [2005] after
finding malachite green in eel and eel-related products from those countries.
Malachite green, which has been found to be carcinogenic in rats, has been
widely used by fish farmers to kill parasites. The chemical is banned in many
countries, including China.
Earlier this month Hong Kong, which relies heavily on mainland China for food
supplies, found malachite green in eels and other freshwater fish.
China told South Korean authorities that on 12 Aug 2005 it had voluntarily
suspended its eel exports, KFDA officials said. KFDA said it had destroyed or
shipped back the contaminated eels and eel products it found and expanded its
testing of other kinds of fish imported from China.
Singapore and Japan, which import huge amounts of Chinese eels, have also
stepped up checks for malachite green.
Tokyo has warned it will consider a ban if widespread contamination is found,
while Singapore will require all eels and freshwater fish imported from China
to undergo pre-export tests.
Some biologists say there is no need to panic over the detection of malachite
green in fish, because huge amounts of contaminated eel and fish would have to
be eaten before one could develop a risk for cancer. But many also advise it
is best to play it safe.

[Malachite green is a very effective parasite/fungus control in many aquatic
environments. It penetrates deeply into fish body tissues and may be useful
against Proliferative Kidney Disease (PKD) in salmonids. Because of this deep
tissue penetration, malachite green is thought to be toxic to tetras, catfish,
loaches, and some small marine fish. It is also this deep tissue penetration
that may lead to concentrations higher than believed safe for human
consumption, because malachite green is presumed to be a carcinogen. This has
resulted in a ban on using it in the USA, except for aquarium fish. Readers
are reminded that it is banned on the presumption -- not proof -- of its
carcinogenic potential. Nevertheless, there are a number of safety
precautions to be considered when handling malachite green, such as gloves and
eye protection. - Mod.TG]
