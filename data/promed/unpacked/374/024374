[In ProMED-mail post "Rift Valley fever, livestock - South Africa:
OIE 20080607.1813" it was observed that the absence of reports of
human cases is unusual given that a 2007 outbreak spread from Kenya
to Somalia and Tanzania, killing more than 100 people in each
country. The following communication supplies data on human cases.]

Update on human cases of Rift Valley Fever in South Africa 2008
---------------------------------------------------------------
From January 2008 to June 2008, Rift Valley fever (RVF) affecting
cattle, buffalo, and goats was confirmed in a number of localities in
4 provinces in South Africa -- Mpumalanga, North West, Gauteng, and
Limpopo. To date there have been 18 laboratory confirmed human cases
identified through serology for IgG and IgM using a recombinant ELISA
[enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay] technique performed on all
high-risk persons and/or RT-PCR [reverse transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction] on those with acute symptoms suggestive of RVF. All
18 persons had close and significant contact with infected animals or
their tissues. These included a veterinary surgeon exposed during a
necropsy, 4 veterinary students and 2 technicians exposed during
necropsies, a veterinary student who examined an ill calf and 10 farm
workers who either handled infected animals or were involved in
slaughtering livestock. All patients developed fever and myalgia,
encephalitis was noted in 2 of the patients, and 5 of 6 patients
tested demonstrated minor liver dysfunction. One patient remains ill
due to an underlying illness while all the others have recovered with
no sequelae.

[Rift Valley fever virus was first identified in 1931 during an
investigation into an epidemic among sheep on a farm in the Rift
Valley of Kenya. Since then, outbreaks have been reported in
sub-Saharan and North Africa. In 1997-98, a major outbreak occurred in
Kenya, Somalia, and Tanzania, and in September 2000, RVF cases were
confirmed in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, marking the 1st reported
occurrence of the disease outside the African continent [see ProMED
archives below].

According to the WHO
(<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs207/en/>) the vast
majority of human infections result from direct or indirect contact
with the blood or organs of infected animals. The virus can be
transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during
slaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting
veterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses.
Certain occupational groups such as herders, farmers, slaughterhouse
workers, and veterinarians are therefore at higher risk of infection.
The virus infects humans through inoculation, for example via a wound
from an infected knife or through contact with broken skin, or
through inhalation of aerosols produced during the slaughter of
infected animals. The aerosol mode of transmission has also led to
infection in laboratory workers. There is some evidence that humans
may also become infected with RVF by ingesting the unpasteurized or
uncooked milk of infected animals.

Human infections have also resulted from the bites of infected
mosquitoes, most commonly _Aedes_ spp. Transmission of RVF
virus by haematophagous flies is also possible.

To date, no human-to-human transmission of RVF has been documented,
and no transmission of RVF to health care workers has been reported
when standard infection control precautions have been put in place.
There has been no evidence of outbreaks of RVF in urban areas.
