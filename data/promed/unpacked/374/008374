[Citation. Rolando Pajon, Nicole A. Doria-Rose, Xiaoying Shen et al. SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Variant Neutralization after mRNA-1273 Booster Vaccination. 26 Jan 2022. doi: 10.1056/NEJMc2119912]

To The Editor:
The highly transmissible omicron (B.1.1.529) variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is of mounting concern globally. The omicron variant carries a large number of spike mutations, including at least 15 mutations in the receptor-binding domain, which is a major target of neutralizing antibodies.(1) To assess the potential susceptibility of this variant to the mRNA-1273 vaccine, neutralization of the omicron variant by serum samples obtained from vaccinated recipients was compared with neutralization of the prototypical D614G variant and the beta (B.1.351) and delta (B.1.617.2) variants. In a pilot study, neutralization of the omicron variant after the primary 2-dose regimen of the mRNA-1273 vaccine was lower than that of the D614G and beta variants but increased substantially after a booster dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine (Figs. S1 through S3 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at <NEJM.org>).

To confirm and extend these initial findings, we evaluated omicron neutralization by serum samples obtained from participants who had received the primary 2-dose regimen of the mRNA-1273 vaccine (100 μg in each dose) in the Coronavirus Efficacy (COVE) phase 2 and phase 3 trials of that vaccine(2,3) and who had been randomly selected to receive one booster dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine (at a dose of either 50 or 100 μg), the bivalent mRNA-1273.211 vaccine (a 1:1 mix of mRNA-1273 vaccine and beta variant messenger RNAs [mRNAs], for a total dose of either 50 or 100 μg), or the bivalent mRNA-1273.213 vaccine (a 1:1 mix of beta and delta variant mRNAs, for a total dose of 100 μg) (Table S1). The characteristics of the participants, including age and sex, were generally balanced among the groups.

The neutralizing activity of these serum samples was also assessed against the prototypical D614G variant, which was dominant in the pandemic globally during the time period when the COVE trial showed that the mRNA-1273 vaccine had 93% efficacy in preventing symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019.(3) The neutralization titers against the D614G variant that were measured in the pseudovirus assay used in our study were a correlate of vaccine efficacy in the COVE trial.(4)

We found that the primary 2-dose regimen of the mRNA-1273 vaccine elicited detectable neutralizing antibodies against the omicron variant in 85% of the participants 1 month after the 2nd dose. The 50% inhibitory dilution (ID50) geometric mean titer was 35.0 times lower than that against the D614G variant (Figure 1A). Similar results were observed in live-virus focus-reduction and pseudovirus neutralization assays performed independently (Figs. S1, S4, and S5).

Seven months after the 2nd dose was administered (before the booster), neutralization of the omicron variant was detected in only 55% of the participants, and the ID50 geometric mean titers were 8.4 times lower than those against the D614G variant (Figure 1A). A booster dose of 50 μg of the mRNA-1273 vaccine, which is currently approved under Emergency Use Authorization for adults who are 18 years of age or older, was associated with ID50 geometric mean titers against the omicron variant that were 20.0 times higher than those assessed 1 month after the 2nd vaccination; these titers were 2.9 times lower than those against the D614G variant.

Neutralization titers against the omicron variant 6 months after the 3rd (booster) dose of vaccine were 6.3 times lower than the peak titers assessed 1 month after the booster injection, but the titers remained detectable in all the participants (Figure 1A). Six months after the booster, neutralization titers against the omicron variant declined faster than those against the D614G variant; however, this decline in titers against the omicron variant was similar to the decline observed in titers against the D614G variant after a 2nd dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine (by a factor of 7.8 from 1 month to 7 months) (Figure 1A). A similar decline in titers against the D614G variant after a 2nd dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine has been reported elsewhere.(5) The booster dose was associated with improved durability of neutralization of the D614G variant, which was 2.3 times lower 6 months after the booster injection than 1 month after the booster injection.

The 100-μg booster doses of the mRNA-1273, mRNA-1273.211, and mRNA-1273.213 vaccines all generated nearly identical ID50 geometric mean titers against the omicron variant (range, 2115 to 2228); these titers were 2.5-2.6 times higher than those assessed after the 50-μg booster dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine and 1.4-1.5 times higher than the peak titers against the D614G variant 1 month after the 2nd dose in the COVE trial (Figure 1B). The strong boosting of neutralization of the omicron variant was similar to the strong boosting of neutralization of the delta and beta variants (Fig. S6).

Together, these results showed that after the primary 2-dose series of the mRNA-1273 vaccine, neutralization titers against the omicron variant were 35.0 times lower than those against the D614G variant. These lower titers could lead to an increased risk of severe breakthrough infection. However, a booster dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine was associated with neutralization titers against the omicron variant that were 20.0 times higher than those assessed after the 2nd dose of vaccine, and these titers may substantially reduce the risk of breakthrough infection. The decline in neutralization of the omicron variant 6 months after the booster injection was similar to the decline in neutralization titers against the D614G variant 7 months after the 2nd dose.

The limitations of our study include small sample sets that may not reflect neutralization in diverse populations, differences in the length of time before boosting among the groups, and a lack of post-boost efficacy data. These limitations may be addressed in further studies.

[2] Readmission, death after hospital release
Date: Wed 26 Jan 2022

COVID patients at high risk of readmission, death after hospital release
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A large UK study yesterday [25 Jan 2022] in PLOS Medicine finds that COVID-19 patients released from the hospital were more than twice as likely as the general population to be rehospitalized or die within the next 10 months. They were also at nearly 5 times the risk for death from any cause.

London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine researchers led the study, which used the electronic health records of 24 673 COVID-19 patients released from the hospital from February to December 2020 and surviving at least 1 week.

The researchers compared the data with those from 123 362 demographically matched controls from the general population in 2019 and 16 058 patients released from the hospital after treatment of flu from 2017-2019. All patients were followed up for at least 315 days. The median age of COVID-19 patients was 66 years, 56% were men, and 77% were White.

The risk of hospitalization or death (30 968 events) was greater in COVID-19 patients than among controls (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.22) but somewhat lower than among flu patients (aHR, 0.95). But the odds of death from any cause (7439 events) was higher among the COVID-19 group than among controls (aHR, 4.82) and the flu group (aHR, 1.74).

Risks for poor cause-specific outcomes were greater in COVID-19 survivors than in controls and about the same or lower than among flu patients, but the COVID-19 group was more likely than the flu group to be rehospitalized or die because of their initial infection or other lower respiratory tract infection (aHR, 1.37). They were also more likely to be readmitted due to mental-health or cognitive-related issues or to die (aHR, 1.37).

COVID-19 survivors with pre-existing dementia had a particularly high risk of rehospitalization relative to the control and flu groups (age- and sex-adjusted HR, 2.47).

Lead author Krishnan Bhaskaran, PhD, said in a PLOS press release that the increased risk of further health problems after hospital release requires attention. "It is important that patients and their doctors are aware of this so that any problems that develop can be treated as early as possible," he said. "Our findings also highlight the importance of getting vaccinated, which is the best tool we have for preventing severe COVID-19 in the first place."

https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2022/01/26/covid-waves-in-2020-caused-bigger-u-s-death-rate-spike-than-1918-flu-actuaries/?slreturn=20220026230907


COVID Waves in 2020 Caused Bigger U.S Death Rate Spike Than 1918 Flu: Actuaries
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What You Need to Know
• The pandemic led to the biggest U.S. death rate increase from causes other than COVID-19 since 1936.
• The death rate in the highest-income counties increased to 736.1 deaths per 100 000 people, from 638.4 per 100 000 in 2019
• For people ages 5 through 44, increases in the death rate from causes other than COVID-19 were much bigger than the increase caused directly by COVID-19.

The 2020 waves of the COVID-19 pandemic caused the biggest increase in the overall age-adjusted U.S. death rate that the country has ever recorded, and their impact was bigger than that of the catastrophic 1918 influenza pandemic, according to a new analysis posted by the Society of Actuaries.

Jerome Holman and Cynthia MacDonald, the authors, based the analysis on data from the National Center for Health Statistics, which is an arm of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The analysis includes only pandemic mortality impact figures for 2020, not for the devastating COVID-19 waves that hit in 2021.

Holman and MacDonald found that the age-adjusted U.S. mortality rate from all causes increased by 16.8% between 2019 and 2020, after falling 1.2% between 2018 and 2019.

The 1918 flu pandemic, which killed about 500 000 of the 100 million people who lived in the United States at that time, and shaped life insurers' ideas about what an "extreme mortality event" looks like, caused an increase of just 11.7%.

COVID-19 increased the U.S. death rate both by killing people directly and by increasing the death rate from all other causes of death.

COVID-19 itself led to an 11.9% increase in the 2020 U.S. death rate, and changes in the death rates for all other causes pushed up the overall death rate by another 4.9%.

For a look at how overall age-adjusted death rates for causes other than COVID-19 changed between 2019 and 2020, see the gallery above [refer to the source URL for slideshow].

Possible Reasons
----------------
The apparent increase in the number of deaths attributed to conditions other than COVID-19 might have been partly due to choices doctors made about listing causes of death. In some cases, for example, deaths blamed on accidents or diabetes could have been caused by COVID-19.

But the pandemic might have also increased death rates from other causes by interfering with people's ability to get ordinary health care. Health insurers have repeatedly reported that decreases in spending on ordinary health care have offset spending on care for COVID-19.

In some cases, the psychological and economic effects caused by pandemic control efforts, such as moves to shut down retail businesses and encourage people to stay home, might have further increased the indirect effects of COVID-19 on mortality.

The Pandemic and Age
------------------------
Holman and MacDonald produced tables showing how the pandemic has affected the death rates for people in different age groups.

Death rates fell in 2020 for male and female babies, and for girls ages 1 through 4.

For women and girls ages 5 through 44, and for men and boys ages 1 through 44, indirect pandemic effects caused a much bigger increase in death rates than COVID-19 itself caused.

For people ages 45 through 54, the direct effects of COVID-19 led to a slightly bigger increase in mortality than the indirect effects.

For people ages 55 and older, COVID-19 itself had a much bigger effect on mortality than the indirect effects.

Because the indirect effects of the pandemic were so deadly for women ages 25 through 44 and for men and boys ages 15 through 34, their overall rates of death increased by more than 20% between 2019 and 2020.

The Pandemic and Socioeconomic Status
-------------------------------------
People with life insurance and individual annuities tend to have higher income, financial wealth and health levels than members of the general population.

Holman and MacDonald tried to tease out the effects of income and other economic factors on 2020 mortality rates by looking at the CDC's county-level 2020 mortality data.

The actuaries divided the counties into quintiles, or fifths, using data on median family income levels, unemployment rates, median home values and other factors that reflect residents' socioeconomic status.

COVID-19, and the indirect effects of the pandemic, hit people in counties in all quintiles hard, but they hit people in the less wealthy counties hardest.

In the counties in the wealthiest quintile, for example, the overall death rate per 100 000 residents increased to 736.1 in 2020, from 638.4 in 2019. COVID-19 led to 79.1 additional deaths per 100 000 lives, and other causes led to 18.5 additional deaths per 100 000 lives.

For counties in the poorest quintile, the overall death rate per 100 000 people increased to 1097.2 from 922.7, with COVID-19 accounting for 117.5 additional deaths per 100 000 lives and other causes leading to 57 additional deaths per 100 000 lives.

The figures mean that people in the poorest counties were about 33% more likely to die from COVID-19 than people in the wealthiest counties, and about 3 times more likely to die from the effects of the pandemic on all other causes of death. ... - more

[4] Long COVID
Date: Wed 26 Jan 2022

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/25/health/long-covid-risk-factors.html


New Research Hints at 4 Factors That May Increase Chances of Long COVID
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
If further study confirms the findings, they could lead to ways to prevent and treat the complex condition.

The researchers said they had found that there was an association between these factors and long COVID (which goes by the medical name post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, or PASC) whether the initial infection was serious or mild. They said that the findings might suggest ways to prevent or treat some cases of long COVID, including the possibility of giving people antiviral medications soon after an infection has been diagnosed.

"It's the first real solid attempt to come up with some biologic mechanisms for long COVID," said Dr. Steven Deeks, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved in the study.

He and other experts, along with the study authors themselves, cautioned that the findings were exploratory and would need to be verified by considerably more research.

Still, Dr. Deeks said: "They've identified these 4 major factors. Each is biologically plausible, consistent with theories that other people are pursuing, and importantly, each is actionable. If these pathways get confirmed, we as clinicians can actually design interventions to make people better. That is the take-home message."

One of the 4 factors researchers identified is the level of coronavirus RNA in the blood early in the infection, an indicator of viral load. Another is the presence of certain autoantibodies -- antibodies that mistakenly attack tissues in the body as they do in conditions like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. A 3rd factor is the reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus, a virus that infects most people, often when they are young, and then usually becomes dormant.

The final factor is having Type 2 diabetes, although the researchers and other experts said that in studies involving larger numbers of patients, it might turn out that diabetes is only one of several medical conditions that increase the risk of long COVID. ...

The most influential factor appeared to be autoantibodies, which were associated with two-thirds of the cases of long COVID, Dr. Heath said. Each of the other three factors showed up in about a third of the cases, he said, and there was considerable overlap, with several factors identified in some patients. ...

Summary:
Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) represent an emerging global crisis. However, quantifiable risk-factors for PASC and their biological associations are poorly resolved. We executed a deep multi-omic, longitudinal investigation of 309 COVID-19 patients from initial diagnosis to convalescence (2-3 months later), integrated with clinical data, and patient-reported symptoms. We resolved 4 PASC-anticipating risk factors at the time of initial COVID-19 diagnosis: type 2 diabetes, SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia, Epstein-Barr virus viremia, and specific autoantibodies. In patients with gastrointestinal PASC, SARS-CoV-2-specific and CMV-specific CD8+ T cells exhibited unique dynamics during recovery from COVID-19. Analysis of symptom-associated immunological signatures revealed coordinated immunity polarization into 4 endotypes exhibiting divergent acute severity and PASC. We find that immunological associations between PASC factors diminish over time leading to distinct convalescent immune states. Detectability of most PASC factors at COVID-19 diagnosis emphasizes the importance of early disease measurements for understanding emergent chronic conditions and suggests PASC treatment strategies. - Mod.LK]

In the past 24 hours, 52 countries: USA (727 218), France (428 008), India (288 758), Brazil (219 878), Germany (188 759), Italy (170 940), Sweden (138 985), Spain (133 553), Japan (130 669), Israel (110 532), Belgium (108 720), UK (101 603), Peru (94 097), Argentina (88 503), Turkey (77 434), Russia (74 692), Portugal (65 578), Netherlands (58 616), Poland (53 416), Australia (50 867), Sweden (50 495), Mexico (48 627), Denmark (43 719), Switzerland (43 063), Czech Republic (39 716), Romania (34 255), Austria (34 011), Kazakhstan (25 514), Norway (24 677), Ukraine (24 321), Hungary (20 174), Panama (19 722), Serbia (19 063 ), Chile (18 736), Canada (18 567), Greece (17 960), Colombia (17 889), Slovenia (17 553), Georgia (17 530), Philippines (15 647), Vietnam (15 954), Bangladesh (15 527), South Korea (14 514), Slovakia (13 837), Jordan (12 826), Pakistan (12 735), Iran (11 851), Croatia (11 812), Uruguay (11 668), Guadeloupe (10 554), Ecuador (10 516), and Lithuania (10 301) reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 11 855 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 24 Jan 2022 to late 25 Jan 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last few weeks can be attributed to the rapid spread of the omicron variant globally. The 7-day averages indicate an increasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 89 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 42 of the 89 countries are from the European region, 13 are from the Americas region, 16 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 6 from the South East Asia region, and 6 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 8.3%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 15.9%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 20.0% decrease in daily reported cases and a 25.6% increase in reported deaths.
