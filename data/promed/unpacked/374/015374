Equine virus found in Wyoming
-----------------------------
Wyoming's 1st confirmed case of equine herpes virus 1 has been found
in a Johnson County horse, state veterinarian Jim Logan said on
Wednesday [22 Jun 2011]. The horse has been isolated from other horses
on the premises and the location is under quarantine, Logan said in a
media release. Another horse from the same location was destroyed
because of signs of the virus. Diagnostic tests are pending, Logan
said.

Meanwhile, officials at the Wyoming High School Rodeo Finals in
Douglas canceled the jackpot events, said Dixie Huxtable, the state's
national director. The finals kick off Thursday and conclude Sunday
[26 Jun 2011] at the Wyoming State Fairgrounds.

"We canceled them just to keep the risks down," Huxtable said.
Jackpots are commonly held outside rodeos, allowing contestants and
all-comers to compete for cash in such events as team roping. The
elimination of the jackpot events will ensure the horses are those
already brought in by the high school contestants, she said. Huxtable
said the rodeo offers a number of precautionary recommendations such
as not allowing horses to share buckets of water.

Logan said there is little reason to cancel horse events or restrict
movement of horses other than those under quarantine since this
appears to be an isolated incident. The Johnson County incident, he
said, is not related to the Ogden, Utah, cutting horses event, which
led to a multistate outbreak in May [2011]. The disease is not
uncommon or new and has been reported in Wyoming in the past, he
said.

In addition to causing neurologic syndrome, the virus can lead to
respiratory symptoms, weak foals, late-term abortion in pregnant mares
and death. Logan and the other veterinarians in the state office were
at a meeting in Jackson on Wednesday afternoon and couldn't be
contacted for further comment.

Dr Dwayne Christensen, a Kaycee veterinarian, said he talked with Dr
Tom Berry, a Buffalo veterinarian, who reported the disease in the
Johnson County horses. He said the afflicted animals were not in a
large group of horses and apparently were isolated. Christensen said
he doesn't expect a lot of cancellations of horse events unless there
are more cases of the disease.

During the outbreak from the Ogden event, Laramie County Community
College postponed its equine classes and prohibited horses from being
brought to or taken from campus for 2 weeks as a precaution.

The Sweetwater County Events Complex also canceled some horse events
shortly after the Ogden outbreak. Candy Pendleton, the events
coordinator, said people were concerned because Rock Springs is on
Interstate 80, which connects with Utah. "We ended up closing our
facility for a little over a week and I went and disinfected all our
surfaces -- panels and doors -- as a precautionary measure," she said.
She had not yet heard of the new case Wednesday.

[With the precautions being taken to ensure an outbreak does not
occur, then there is hope this is an isolated incident.

It is nice to see that out of all the tragedies from Utah, people are
taking this disease seriously and not taking chances of having other
horses infected. - Mod.TG
