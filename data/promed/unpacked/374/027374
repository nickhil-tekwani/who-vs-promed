Avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection - WHO Update 23
--------------------------------------------------------
Situation (human) in Thailand
-----------------------------
The Ministry of Public Health in Thailand has confirmed 2 additional cases
of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection. The newly reported cases are a
2 year old boy from Suphanburi Province and a 27 year old woman from
Uttaradit Province. Both cases have fully recovered and were discharged
from hospital earlier this week. Investigations of the 2 cases have
identified contact with sick or dead chickens. The 13 year old boy, whose
infection was confirmed yesterday, died today. Altogether, 8 confirmed
cases, 6 of them fatal, have been reported in Thailand.
Clinical descriptions of Thailand's first 5 cases have been published today
[see below].

Preliminary clinical description of influenza A (H5N1) virus infection in
Thailand
-----------------------------------------------
As at Mon 9 Feb 2004, a total of 23 laboratory confirmed human cases of
H5N1 have been reported in Viet Nam and Thailand. Of these 18 (78 per cent)
have died. Previous clinical experience with avian H5N1 disease in humans
is limited to the description of 18 patients in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region of China (Hong Kong SAR) during the 1997 outbreak.
The H5N1 viruses identified in Asia in 2004 are antigenically and
genetically distinguishable from the 1997 viruses and appear to be
associated with fatal infections among poultry and also a variety of wild
bird species, which is unusual. The current report is a preliminary
clinical description of the initial 5 confirmed cases in Thailand to aid
surveillance and clinical activities.
Of the 5 laboratory confirmed cases in Thailand, 4 were in boys aged 6-7
years, all of whom were previously healthy. 4 patients reported deaths in
poultry owned by their family and 2 of these reported touching an ill
chicken. One had ill chickens in his neighbourhood and was reported to have
played near a chicken cage. None of the confirmed cases occurred among
persons involved in the mass culling of chickens.
Patients presented to hospital 2 to 6 days after onset of fever and cough.
Other early symptoms included sore throat (4), rhinorrhoea (2), and myalgia
(2). Shortness of breath was reported in all patients 1 to 5 days after
symptom onset. On admission, clinically apparent pneumonia with chest X-ray
changes was seen in all patients, with patchy infiltrates in 4 and
interstitial infiltrates in one. Diarrhoea and vomiting were not reported.
Peripheral leukocytes were normal or decreased, and 4 patients had
lymphopenia (<1000/ml). Mild to moderate elevations in hepatic
transaminases were found in 4 patients.
All patients required oxygen support and intubation an average of 7 days
(range 4 to 10 days) after onset of illness. 2 patients developed a
pneumothorax. Decreased cardiac function requiring inotropic support
developed in 3 patients after the onset of respiratory failure, and 2
patients developed renal impairment as a later manifestation. None had
documented evidence of secondary bacterial infections.
Three patients were treated with oseltamivir for 3 to 5 days late in the
course of illness. All received empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics for
community-acquired pneumonia while their cause of illness was under
investigation. 4 were treated with systemic steroids for increasing
respiratory distress and clinically diagnosed acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS) with compatible chest X-ray changes. 3 of the children died
2 to 4 weeks after symptom onset, and one child and the adult died 8 days
after onset of illness. All patients had laboratory evidence of influenza A
(H5N1) virus infection by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction;
in 3 cases the virus was isolated in tissue culture, and in 3 the viral
antigens were identified by immunofluorescent assay. [Data for each
individual patient are appended to the text in a table.]
Preliminary epidemiological summary of human avian influenza A(H5N1) virus
infection, Viet Nam, and Thailand
-------------------------------------------------
On 5 Jan 2004, the Viet Nam WHO country office reported to the Regional
Office for the Western Pacific that, since mid-October 2003, 11 children, 7
of whom had died, had been admitted to the National Hospital for
Paediatrics (NHP) in Hanoi with severe atypical respiratory illness.
On 8 Jan 2004, Viet Nam reported outbreaks on 3 farms of highly pathogenic
avian influenza (HPAI) due to influenza A/H5 viruses to the World
Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). The following day, initial laboratory
testing indicated that one child had been infected with an influenza A (H5)
virus, and preliminary field investigation of the 5 current patients
suggested a common link to sudden chicken deaths in the previous 2 months
on their own or neighbouring farms.
On 12 Jan 2004, the Government Virus Unit, National Influenza Centre, Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region of China, a WHO reference laboratory for
diagnosis of influenza viral infection, confirmed influenza A (H5N1) viral
infection in 3 patients.
As of Mon 9 Feb 2004, Viet Nam has reported 18 laboratory confirmed cases
of influenza A/H5 viral infection, including 13 deaths. Dates of onset are
available for 11 cases, the earliest being 22 Dec 2003 and the most recent
13 Jan 2004. A field investigation in Viet Nam of a family cluster
including 2 confirmed cases and an unexplained death due to acute
respiratory illness provided no conclusive evidence of human-to-human
transmission.
On 23 Jan 2004, the Thai Ministry of Public Health reported to WHO 2
laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A (H5N1) virus infection in
children. On the same day, Thailand reported an HPAI outbreak due to
influenza A (H5) virus to OIE.
As of Mon 9 Feb 2004, Thailand has reported 5 laboratory-confirmed cases of
influenza A (H5) virus infection, all of them fatal. The first date of
onset is 3 Jan 2004, and the most recent is 24 Jan 2004. There is no
reported human-to-human transmission.
Outbreaks of HPAI are currently widespread in Asia. To date, no other
countries have reported human laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A (H5).
WHO has established a standard case definition for reporting of
laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A (H5) viral infection. A confirmed
case is an individual, alive or deceased, in whom laboratory testing
demonstrates one or more of the following:
- positive viral culture for influenza A (H5);
- positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for influenza A (H5);
- positive immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) test for H5 antigen using H5
monoclonal antibodies;
- 4-fold rise in H5-specific antibody titre in paired serum samples.
Sex and age distributions of confirmed cases in Thailand and Viet Nam are
comparable by non-parametric analyses. A summary aggregated descriptive
analysis follows. Of the 23 cases, 10 (43 per cent) are female. The median
age is 13 years (mean 16 years; range 4 to 58 years). Of the 20 cases for
which outcome is final, 18 have died. In the 12 cases for which data are
available, the median time interval between onset of symptoms and death is
13 days (mean 13.5 days; range 5 to 31 days).
Preliminary conclusions
-----------------------
The 1997 outbreak of influenza A(H5N1) in Hong Kong SAR established for the
first time that highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses could directly
infect humans, with resulting illness that was fatal in 6 of 18 patients.
The viruses were not efficiently transmitted from person to person, and
human infections stopped after the culling of all chickens in Hong Kong SAR.
The current avian outbreak is far more widespread, with poultry disease
reported across much of east and south-east Asia. Direct infection of
humans with the current H5 viruses has now been confirmed at least in
Thailand and Viet Nam, raising concerns about the potential for pandemic
spread.
Despite the antigenic and genetic differences in the H5N1 viruses causing
the current Asian outbreaks, many of the clinical features of the 5 human
cases described here appear broadly similar to the earlier descriptions of
the severely affected patients from Hong Kong SAR. Disease was severe, with
pneumonia progressing over several days to respiratory failure and death in
all 5. Fever, sore throat, cough, and lymphopenia were important early
distinguishing features. Other organ involvement included mild to moderate
hepatitis, and later cardiac and renal impairment. By contrast with the
cases reported from Hong Kong SAR, gastrointestinal symptoms were not
prominent features. Because of the severity of disease and the concern for
the safety of health care personnel, the Ministry of Public Health in
Thailand recommends that hospitalized patients with suspected avian
influenza be cared for using airborne precautions wherever possible.
Empirical treatment should include broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs to
cover for the major causes of pneumonia (for example, _Streptococcus
pneumoniae_), including possible superinfection with _Staphylococcus
aureus_. Preliminary testing indicates that current H5N1 strains may be
resistant to amantadine and rimantadine. Therefore, treatment with
neuraminidase inhibitors should be initiated as early as possible after
presentation.
The effectiveness of antiviral drugs against H5N1 infections and the time
period after which these drugs will provide little or no benefit is not
known. A more detailed understanding of the pathogenesis is needed to
direct therapeutic approaches such as the use of immunomodulating drugs.
Updated recommendations for hospital infection control and treatment should
be available on the websites of WHO or the US Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC).
The epidemiology of influenza A(H5N1) in Thailand and neighbouring
countries remains incompletely described, but the confirmed human
infections have occurred in geographical areas with recognized avian
disease, and 2 of the patients reported direct physical contact with ill or
dead chickens. It is noteworthy that 4 of the 5 laboratory confirmed cases
in Thailand were 6 or 7 year old boys, perhaps identifying a group with
particular high-risk behaviours.
It will be important to conduct case-control studies in Thailand and Viet
Nam to define specific risk factors for infection and allow for the
development of strong, evidence-based public health interventions.
Control of highly pathogenic avian influenza should include surveillance
for affected flocks, aggressive culling based on international guidelines
to eradicate foci of infection, careful protection of cullers through the
use of personal protective equipment, and the use of the currently licensed
human trivalent influenza vaccine to reduce the risk of co-infection in
poultry workers and cullers, which might lead to genetic reassortment of
avian and human influenza viruses. Clinicians should be aware of the
presenting features of the current human influenza A(H5N1) disease and the
exposures of concern, so that patients can be quickly identified and
appropriately managed and health care workers protected.
