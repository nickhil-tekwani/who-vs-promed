The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated 21 Jun 2018:
- a total of 57 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, including 38 confirmed, 14 probable, and 5 suspected;
- 2 new suspected cases, including 1 in Bikoro and 1 in Iboko;
- 24 people have been cured of Ebola virus disease since the beginning of the epidemic;
- the last confirmed case dates back to 6 Jun 2018;
- the last contact will be taken from the contact list on 27 Jun 2018.

Remarks
- Negative tests are systematically removed from the summary table.
- The probable case category includes all reported deaths for which it was not possible to obtain biological samples for laboratory confirmation.
- Epidemiological analyzes have identified contacts living in nearby health areas in Bikoro and Iboko. These contacts are followed and advised to limit their movements during the entire follow-up period of 21 days.

News from the Ebola response
Vaccination
- Since the launch of the vaccination on 21 May 2018, 3268 people have been vaccinated, including 843 in Mbandaka, 779 in Bikoro, 1518 in Iboko, 107 in Ingende, and 21 in Kinshasa.

[2] Community involvement: 1st hand account
- 24 Jun 2018. PPE, 21 days, chlorine, 'treatment centres, safe burials
[Ponabona, edited]

'PPE', '21 days', 'chlorine', 'treatment centres', 'safe burials' and, most of all, 'Ebola' are words that I hoped I wouldn't hear again. I personally witnessed the unprecedented Ebola outbreak which consumed parts of West Africa between 2013 and 2016. The damage and heartbreak it caused is something that will remain with me for a long time. The impact was devastating -- Ebola killed more than 11 000 individuals and some 16 000 children lost parents or caregivers.

It was only normal I suppose, to feel a certain trepidation boarding the flight from Kinshasa to Equateur province -- the epicentre of the current outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). As the cityscape turned into lush forest far below, I wondered -- and hoped -- will this outbreak will be different? Can it be contained? Will the lessons learnt from the West African outbreak be applied here?

On touching down in Mbandaka, the capital of Equateur province, it is clear that the response is in full throttle. Schools are equipped with buckets full of chlorine so that children can wash their hands; teams are tracing 'contacts', people that infected patients may have come into contact with, to verify they don't have symptoms; health workers are visiting remote communities explaining how to stop the spread of Ebola; and temperatures are being taken at the port to make sure no one is entering the town carrying the disease.

There are 2 things that I notice straight away -- both welcome. First, the remarkable level of involvement of children in educating others. I speak to one teenage girl who is a young radio journalist and has taken to the airwaves to warn others about the dangers of the disease. In a school, I meet one boy who proudly explains how he instructs his family about the importance of handwashing and not touching others. It's a message I keep hearing repeated amongst a number of children. Second, the experimental Ebola vaccine is being rolled out in high-risk areas. I've seen numerous people patiently queuing to receive the vaccine. They're not scared, they're not stigmatised -- they are individuals who know that they may have been inadvertently exposed to the virus and are proactively trying to mitigate the risk to themselves and their communities.

Filming an Ebola outbreak is always challenging -- from both a safety perspective and an ethical one. As outsiders, we tend to focus on the deaths and to depict patients as helpless victims. Too little media attention is given to the role of the community -- probably the most important actor in countering Ebola. Men, women, and children are coming together with dignity as agents for change. It is these empowered individuals and communities who will ultimately defeat the disease on the banks of the Congo River.

This is a noteworthy, albeit brief, report highlighting how effective it is to engage children in bringing about control of the spread of Ebola virus. Communities in Latin America have taken a similar approach in trying to control a very different disease, dengue, which is mosquito-borne, by teaching the children their homes should be free of open containers with water, where _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes breed. The children bring this information home to their mothers who implement it. Involvement of the communities being affected by Ebola virus disease is similarly critical to control efforts, in this case because of the lack of trust of outsiders. For that reason, it is heartening that the vaccine has been so well accepted, especially when there is so much vaccine hesitancy elsewhere in the world. Overall, the cooperation among the multitude of institutions and the affected communities, and the dedication of health care personnel has led to a highly effective outbreak response. One can see how far the DRC has come when returning to an earlier post from the start of the outbreak [http://ponabana.com/en/ebola-a-war-for-life/ posted 31 May 2018; excerpt:
Peculiarly, when I left the airport to present myself at the UNICEF office, you could not tell that Ebola was not far away... apart from some UNICEF handwashing units and some posters, nothing led you to think of Ebola: public places were crowded; merchants travelled up and down the streets, and the taxi-motorbikes (and the taxi-bikes) were packed. Everyone went about their daily business. But since the famous Tue 8 May 2018, in the refuge of certain buildings in the city, a race against the clock was taking its course: it was necessary to implement a response plan to contain the epidemic as rapidly as possible. This is a war for life. In light of the emergency, offices and meeting rooms were transformed into crisis zones. Mod.LK]

[3] Persistence
- 22 Jun 2018. Ebola flare-ups in West Africa linked to 'persistently' infected survivors
[Healio, Infectious Disease News, edited]
https://tinyurl.com/yavhones


Researchers linked 8 flare-ups of Ebola virus disease that occurred in West Africa after the peak of the region's 2-year epidemic to survivors who became "persistently and subclinically infected" following an acute Ebola virus disease episode.

"Because scientific evidence of persistent infection and its possible consequences is now available, counseling should be prioritized, because often survivors of the West African outbreak were unaware of the risk they represented to their relatives," Ibrahima-Soce Fall, Dr Med, MPH, PhD, MSc, FFPH, regional emergencies director at WHO's Regional Office for Africa, and colleagues wrote in The Journal of Infectious Diseases [see reference below].

More than 29 000 people were infected in the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa from 2014-2016 and 11 310 died. The epidemic left behind 17 000 survivors -- the largest cohort of Ebola survivors in history, according to the researchers.

Previous studies have shown that some Ebola survivors have antibodies 40 years after recovery, and that many Ebola infections may go unrecognized.

The virus can be detected in semen up to 18 months after recovery, according to Fall and colleagues. It can persist in other bodily fluids, including breast milk and the eye's aqueous humor.

To better understand the risk for Ebola resurgence, Fall and colleagues reviewed data on 8 flare-ups in West Africa that were documented since January 2015, when the number of new cases in the region started to decline. The flare-ups occurred up to 11 months after the 1st Ebola-free status declaration was made by WHO in May 2015.

According to the researchers:
- The 1st flare-up was linked to male-to-female sexual transmission that occurred in Liberia 5 months after the male Ebola survivor was discharged from an Ebola treatment unit.
- The 1st identified case of the 2nd flare-up was a 17-year-old boy in Liberia who died more than 1 month after the country was declared free of Ebola. Investigations revealed that he was 1 of 5 confirmed cases who recently consumed meat of a slaughtered dog. However, a sample of the dog carcass was negative for EBOV. 2 additional cases were reported during this resurgence, which Fall and colleagues said may have been caused by an unidentified survivor.
-The 3rd flare-up occurred after EBOV was identified in a 9-month-old baby who died in Guinea. The strain was similar to a strain isolated from the breast milk of the baby's mother. Molecular sequencing revealed both the mother and father were undiagnosed survivors.
- The 4th flare-up was identified after officials discovered an EBOV-positive postmortem swab 50 days after the last confirmed cases were detected in Sierra Leone. The case was linked to male-to-female sexual transmission. The daughter of the deceased woman also contracted Ebola, possibly when caring for her mother. 6 additional cases were identified during this resurgence.
- Similarly, sexual transmission may have been the source of the 5th flare-up. The wife of an Ebola survivor in Guinea developed an infection that initially went unrecognized. Her brother, who also became infected, may have been exposed to EBOV while caring for her.
- The 6th flare-up occurred in Liberia 3 months after the 2nd declaration of Ebola-free status in the country. Although there was limited evidence, the 3 confirmed cases were linked to a persistently infected individual.
- Likewise, the 7th flare-up occurred 2 months after Sierra Leone was declared free of Ebola for the 1st time, but investigators could not definitively locate the source of the infection.
- The final flare-up was detected after 3 deaths in the same community were classified as probable Ebola cases. Soon after, EBOV was found in blood samples of contacts who attended funerals of the initial 3 cases. The source of the resurgence was linked to a survivor whose semen tested positive for EBOV nearly 17 months after recovery. Overall, 13 probable and confirmed cases were identified during this resurgence.

In addition to these flare-ups, Fall and colleagues warned that other events "surely happened" but went unnoticed. After reviewing these cases, the researchers said they recommend that survivors' body fluids be monitored for at least 18 months after recovery or until their fluids test negative at least twice. They also called for counseling and sexual health education for survivors, as well as the implementation of other preventive measures, such as vaccination of contacts and screening blood and semen donations.

"Working groups led by Ebola experts and coordinated by WHO are ongoing to update recommendations on how to best structure and implement such follow-up programs," they concluded.

[Because of the persistence of Ebola virus for up to 18 months in semen, it is important for healthcare workers to be vigilant for occasional cases and counsel patients and contacts when there is any possibility of virus transmission. Education on how the virus is spread and what personal measures must be taken to prevent infection [such as, behavior at funerals, sexual behavior, pursuit of wild animals as food] and how to protect oneself when a case is suspect must become common discourse. - Mod.LK]

[4] Lessons

Abstract
--------
This systematic literature review compared the epidemiological (EPI) research and the qualitative social and behavioral science (SBS) research published during the West Africa Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic. Beginning with an initial capture of over 2000 articles, we extracted 236 EPI and 171 SBS studies to examine how disciplinary priorities affected research conducted during the EVD response, with implications for epidemic response effectiveness. Building on this research, we set forth a roadmap for the closer integration of EPI and SBS research in all aspects of epidemic preparedness and response that incorporates the lessons of the West Africa EVD outbreak. Key priorities include: (1) developing the capacity to systematically quantify qualitative sociocultural variables, (2) establishing interdisciplinary collaborations to improve "risk segmentation" practices, (3) creating and pre-positioning qualitative indicators and composite sociocultural indexes for rapid deployment in outbreaks; (4) integrating novel systems with community resources; (5) developing new techniques for modeling social mobilization and community engagement; (6) prioritizing good data and complex analyses early in emergencies, and (7) learning from past experiences. Our findings support a program of action that situates data collection and analysis in real-time, recursive, integrated efforts to move community attitudes, behaviors, and responses into epidemiological research.

[While the Ebola vaccine may have contributed significantly to disruption of this current DRC outbreak, the West Africa outbreak was eventually controlled by a combination of "classic public health measures, including population surveillance, case identification and management, aggressive contact tracing, isolation, quarantine and mobility restrictions. Social mobilization and local initiatives promoted behavior change among affected populations, also contributing to epidemic containment." In this study, the investigators assessed the extent to which epidemiological (EPI) and social and behavioral (SBS) research efforts mutually provide the knowledge needed to respond to disease outbreaks. - Mod.LK
