An unknown disease has killed at least 40 cattle in Kaliganj upazila [Gazipur District] last week [week of Feb 5 2017], creating panic among the farmers.

A total of 22 cows and 18 goats were killed by the disease at Pashuram village.
Panicked cattle farmers have started selling their cattle at low prices in the local markets.

Farmer [HI] said the affected cattle 1st starts trembling and then the stomach swells up. An affected cow dies within one and a half hours, while a goat dies within 15 to 20 minutes, he added. "I lost 2 cows and a goat due to the disease," he said, adding that he sold 3 cows and 4 goats at low price out of fear of losing those.

[SA] said he lost 3 cows and 2 goats, adding that he has sent his 4 cows and 6 goats to a relative's house in a nearby village.

"My 3 cows were my only asset, but they died of the disease on [Mon 13 Feb 2017] night," said [AH].

[AI] said an unknown disease had broken out for the 1st time in the village in the middle of February in 2015 and at least 12 cattle died then, adding that the disease returned last year [2016] at the same time, and at least 23 cattle died. "The disease has come back at the same time, but it is more serious this year [2017]," he said, adding that 40 cattle have already died, and it is continuing.

"We don't know how we will save our cattle from the disease as we are not getting appropriate advice and treatment facilities from livestock officials," said Maminul Islam. "Livestock officials visited our village but they didn't give any advice on how to save our cattle," he added.

Livestock Officer Dr ASM Nasir Uddin Khan said, "We have collected samples from the affected cattle and they have been sent to the laboratory in Dhaka. We suspect it could be food poisoning."

[Though the available information on the described event is rather scarce, in particular additional clinical signs (including body temperature recordings) and PM [post-mortem] findings, the following characteristics deserve to be kept in mind during the investigation:

1. The course of the "unknown disease" is rapid;
2. It affects cattle AND goats.
3. In case the observations of one of the interviewed farmers are accurate, a similar event has been recorded during the same season in 2015 and 2016.

It will be interesting to note if the murrain is fatal in all cases (no survivals?), if it is limited to housed or grazing animals, and if other animal species, under similar conditions (and ownership?), remain unaffected.

In case the etiology includes an infectious agent, the seasonality of the event may be indicative of a vectorborne spread. In case the etiology is non-infectious, a poisonous plant, palatable to both cattle and goats, may be taken into consideration.

Results of the epidemiological and laboratory investigations are anticipated.

Kaliganj is an Upazila of Gazipur District in the Division of Dhaka, Bangladesh. - Mod.AS
