[2] Zika cross protection against dengue
Date: February 2018 [ahead of print]
Source: The Lancet Global Health 6 (2): e140-e141 DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(17)30496-5 [edited]

Guilherme Sousa Ribeiro, Mariana Kikuti, Laura B Tauro, Leile Camila J Nascimento, Cristiane W Cardoso, et al. Does immunity after Zika virus infection cross-protect against dengue?

Summary
Zika and dengue viruses are closely related flaviviruses, with immunological interactions and identical urban, mosquito-borne transmission.1 Therefore, the recent introduction of Zika virus into the Americas and large-scale exposure of a uniformly previously unexposed population could affect subsequent transmission of dengue virus. This hypothesis had been untested, largely because sufficient epidemiological data were not available from affected locations. We explored this hypothesis in Salvador, the 4th largest city in Brazil (population 2.9 million), where extensive transmission of dengue viruses 1-4 occurred before the introduction and spread of Zika virus in 2015.

[Findings]

Our findings, indicating lower frequencies of confirmed dengue virus lasting more than 2 years since early 2015 -- which are lower than at any other period analysed since 2009 -- raised the hypothesis that the 2015 outbreak of Zika virus might have inhibited transmission of dengue virus or of symptomatic infections. Because serological tests for dengue virus, especially IgM ELISA, cross-react with Zika-virus-immune serum samples, it is possible that some citywide cases diagnosed as dengue since 2015 were actually cases of Zika virus. Nonetheless, a major downward trend in dengue cases occurred after the Zika virus outbreak. Few confirmed cases of Zika virus occurred during the Zika virus epidemic, probably reflecting an initial period of inadequate diagnostics. However, there is a strong consensus that northeastern Brazil (where Salvador is located) was the epicentre for the 2015 Zika virus epidemic, and a previous investigation suggested that Zika virus was the most likely cause for the acute exanthematous illness outbreak in the same year in which around 15 000 cases were reported in Salvador by mid-2015.

Aside from sexual Zika virus transmission, the transmission cycles of Zika virus, dengue virus, and chikungunya virus rely on human amplification by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes. In our study, the proportion of patients with acute febrile illness who tested positive for chikungunya virus was highest in the 2nd half of 2015 and throughout 2016. The prolonged and increased positivity rate for chikungunya virus, an alphavirus with no antigenic relationship to Zika virus or dengue virus, suggests that the 2015-17 reduction in dengue virus infections was unrelated to changes in vector efficiency (such as lower vector populations related to weather or control), or to other non-immunological factors.

Although temporal associations do not prove causation, the strength and consistency from both enhanced surveillance and citywide data, together with the observed maintenance of high detection of chikungunya virus after the Zika virus outbreak, suggest that Zika virus infections could induce cross-protective immunity against dengue virus. Prospective studies are needed to fully assess the subsequent risk of dengue after Zika virus exposure and determine whether the putative cross-protection is long-lasting or wanes over time. More specific serological assays, such as assays used for neutralising antibodies, might also help to show this effect more conclusively. If further studies support our hypothesis, they will have direct implications for epidemiological surveillance, immunological investigations of pathogenesis, and vaccine development and assessment.

[It will be interesting to see whether this apparent cross-protection lasts over time. A question for the future is whether declining Zika virus antibodies might cross-react with but not neutralize dengue viruses and cause antibody-dependent enhancement of dengue virus infection with more serious disease. - Mod.TY]

Darwin Elizondo-Quiroga, Aarón Medina-Sánchez, Jorge M. Sánchez-González, Kristen Allison Eckert, et al. Zika Virus in Salivary Glands of Five Different Species of Wild-Caught Mosquitoes from Mexico

Abstract
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen, and _Aedes aegypti_ has been identified as the main vector of the disease. Other mosquito species in the _Aedes_ and _Culex_ genera have been suggested to have the potential for being competent vectors based on experimental exposition of mosquitoes to an infectious blood meal containing ZIKV. Here, we report the isolation in cell culture of ZIKV obtained from different body parts of wild-caught female mosquitoes (_Ae. aegypti_, _Ae. vexans_, _Cx. quinquefasciatus_, _Cx. coronator_, and _Cx. tarsalis_) and whole male mosquitoes (_Ae. aegypti_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_) in Mexico. Importantly, this is the 1st report that shows the presence of the virus in the salivary glands of the wild-caught female mosquitoes species, _Cx. coronator_ _Cx. tarsalis_, and _Ae. vexans_. Our findings strongly suggest that all the species reported herein are potential vectors for ZIKV.

[These observations are an important 1st step in exploring vector capacity of these mosquito species. The next step would be testing their relative susceptibility and ability to transmit in the laboratory. Isolation of the virus from wild-caught male mosquitoes suggests transovarial transmission, which would be an important mechanism for persistence in the mosquito population in nature. It is interesting that the virus was detected in salivary glands of wild-caught female _Cx. quinquefasciatus_. Published reports of susceptibility and transmission efficiency of this species for Zika virus are conflicting, with results ranging from refractory to fully efficient. - Mod.TY]

[4] wAu _Wolbachia_

Thomas H. Ant, Christie S. Herd, Vincent Geoghegan, Ary A. Hoffmann, Steven P. Sinkins. The Wolbachia strain wAu provides highly efficient virus transmission blocking in _Aedes aegypti_.

Abstract
Introduced transinfections of the inherited bacteria _Wolbachia_ can inhibit transmission of viruses by _Aedes_ mosquitoes, and in Ae. aegypti are now being deployed for dengue control in a number of countries. Only 3 _Wolbachia_ strains from the large number that exist in nature have to date been introduced and characterized in this species. Here novel _Ae. aegypti_ transinfections were generated using the wAlbA and wAu strains. In its native _Ae. albopictus_, wAlbA is maintained at lower density than the co-infecting wAlbB, but following transfer to _Ae. aegypti_ the relative strain density was reversed, illustrating the strain-specific nature of _Wolbachia_-host co-adaptation in determining density. The wAu strain also reached high densities in _Ae. aegypti_, and provided highly efficient transmission blocking of dengue and Zika viruses. Both wAu and wAlbA were less susceptible than wMel to density reduction/incomplete maternal transmission resulting from elevated larval rearing temperatures. Although wAu does not induce cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), it was stably combined with a CI-inducing strain as a superinfection, and this would facilitate its spread into wild populations. _Wolbachia_ wAu provides a very promising new option for arbovirus control, particularly for deployment in hot tropical climates.

Author summary
Mosquito-borne viral diseases represent an increasing threat to human and animal health globally. The mosquito species _Aedes aegypti_, a primary vector of the most significant human arboviral infections including the dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses, is highly invasive and is almost ubiquitous in tropical urban areas. Mosquito control remains the main approach for preventing and controlling outbreaks. A novel control strategy that is currently being trialed in several countries utilizes _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes artificially infected with a bacterial symbiont known as _Wolbachia pipientis_. Although many insect species harbor native _Wolbachia_ infections, _Ae. aegypti_ is naturally uninfected. _Wolbachia_ lives within host cells and is passed-on from mother to offspring, and can block virus transmission; once released it can invade and persist in host populations. Here we present the infection and assessment of 2 novel _Wolbachia_ strains in _Ae. aegypti_. We show that one of the strains, wAu, provides particularly strong blocking of dengue and Zika virus transmission and offers greater stability at higher temperatures when compared to wMel--currently the most widely used strain for field releases. These results suggest that wAu is promising option for arbovirus control, especially in hot climates.

[The results of these trials are very encouraging. Since many Zika and dengue endemic areas are tropical with hot ambient temperatures, the tolerance of the wAu strain for hot temperatures and its ability to block transmission of these viruses is a promising approach to reduce transmission and disease. - Mod.TY]

Eva Lathrop, MD, Lisa Romero, DrPH, Stacey Hurst, MPH, Nabal Bracero, MD, Lauren B Zapata, PhD, et al. The Zika Contraception Access Network: a feasibility programme to increase access to contraception in Puerto Rico during the 2016-17 Zika virus outbreak.

Summary
Background
Prevention of unintended pregnancy is a primary strategy to reduce adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes related to Zika virus infection. The Zika Contraception Access Network (Z-CAN) aimed to build a network of health-care providers offering client-centred contraceptive counselling and the full range of reversible contraception at no cost to women in Puerto Rico who chose to prevent pregnancy during the 2016-17 Zika virus outbreak. Here, we describe the Z-CAN programme design, implementation activities, and baseline characteristics of the 1st 21 124 participants.

Methods
Z-CAN was developed by establishing partnerships between federal agencies, territorial health agencies, private corporations, and domestic philanthropic and non-profit organisations in the continental USA and Puerto Rico. Private donations to the National Foundation for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCF) secured a supply of reversible contraceptive methods (including long-acting reversible contraception), made available to non-sterilised women of reproductive age at no cost through provider reimbursements and infrastructure supported by the CDCF. To build capacity in contraception service provision, doctors and clinic staff from all public health regions and nearly all municipalities in Puerto Rico were recruited into the programme. All providers completed 1 day of comprehensive training in contraception knowledge, counselling, and initiation and management, including the insertion and removal of long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs). Z-CAN was announced through health-care providers, word of mouth, and a health education campaign. Descriptive characteristics of programme providers and participants were recorded, and we estimated the factors associated with choosing and receiving a LARC method. As part of a Z-CAN programme monitoring plan, participants were invited to complete a patient satisfaction survey about whether they had obtained free, same-day access to their chosen contraceptive method after receiving comprehensive counselling, their perception of the quality of care they had received, and their satisfaction with their chosen method and services.

Findings
Between 4 May 2016, and 15 Aug 2017, 153 providers in the Z-CAN programme provided services to 21 124 women. 20 110 (95 percent) women received same-day provision of a reversible contraceptive method. Whereas only 767 (4 percent) women had used a LARC method before Z-CAN, 14 259 (68 percent) chose and received a LARC method at their initial visit. Of the women who received a LARC method, 10 808 (76 percent) women had used no method or a least effective method of contraception (ie, condoms or withdrawal) before their Z-CAN visit. Of the 3489 women who participated in a patient satisfaction survey, 3068 (93 percent) of 3294 women were very satisfied with the services received, and 3216 (93 percent) of 3478 women reported receiving the method that they were most interested in after receiving counselling. 2382 (78 percent) of 3040 women rated their care as excellent or very good.

Interpretation
Z-CAN was designed as a short-term response for rapid implementation of reversible contraceptive services in a complex emergency setting in Puerto Rico and has served more than 21 000 women. This model could be replicated or adapted as part of future emergency preparedness and response efforts.

Alec J. Hirsch, Victoria H. J. Roberts, Daniel N. Streblow. Zika virus infection in pregnant rhesus macaques causes placental dysfunction and immunopathology.

Abstract
Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy leads to an increased risk of fetal growth restriction and fetal central nervous system malformations, which are outcomes broadly referred to as the Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS). Here we infect pregnant rhesus macaques and investigate the impact of persistent ZIKV infection on uteroplacental pathology, blood flow, and fetal growth and development. Despite seemingly normal fetal growth and persistent fetal-placenta-maternal infection, advanced non-invasive in vivo imaging studies reveal dramatic effects on placental oxygen reserve accompanied by significantly decreased oxygen permeability of the placental villi. The observation of abnormal oxygen transport within the placenta appears to be a consequence of uterine vasculitis and placental villous damage in ZIKV cases. In addition, we demonstrate a robust maternal-placental-fetal inflammatory response following ZIKV infection. This animal model reveals a potential relationship between ZIKV infection and uteroplacental pathology that appears to affect oxygen delivery to the fetus during development.

Delaney A, Mai C, Smoots A, et al. Population-Based Surveillance of Birth Defects Potentially Related to Zika Virus Infection -- 15 States and U.S. Territories, 2016.

Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth defects, including microcephaly and brain abnormalities. Population-based birth defects surveillance systems are critical to monitor all infants and fetuses with birth defects potentially related to Zika virus infection, regardless of known exposure or laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection during pregnancy. CDC analyzed data from 15 U.S. jurisdictions conducting population-based surveillance for birth defects potentially related to Zika virus infection. Jurisdictions were stratified into the following 3 groups: those with 1) documented local transmission of Zika virus during 2016; 2) one or more cases of confirmed, symptomatic, travel-associated Zika virus disease reported to CDC per 100 000 residents; and 3) less than one case of confirmed, symptomatic, travel-associated Zika virus disease reported to CDC per 100 000 residents. A total of 2962 infants and fetuses (3.0 per 1000 live births; 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 2.9-3.2) met the case definition. In areas with local transmission there was a non-statistically significant increase in total birth defects potentially related to Zika virus infection from 2.8 cases per 1000 live births in the 1st half of 2016 to 3.0 cases in the second half (p = 0.10). However, when neural tube defects and other early brain malformations (NTDs) were excluded, the prevalence of birth defects strongly linked to congenital Zika virus infection increased significantly, from 2.0 cases per 1000 live births in the 1st half of 2016 to 2.4 cases in the 2nd half, an increase of 29 more cases than expected (p = 0.009). These findings underscore the importance of surveillance for birth defects potentially related to Zika virus infection and the need for continued monitoring in areas at risk for Zika.

Hongjie Xia, Huanle Luo, Chao Shan, Antonio E. Muruato, Bruno T. D. Nunes, Daniele B. A. Medeiros, et al. An evolutionary NS1 mutation enhances Zika virus evasion of host interferon induction.

Abstract
Virus-host interactions determine an infection outcome. The Asian lineage of Zika virus (ZIKV), responsible for the recent epidemics, has fixed a mutation in the NS1 gene after 2012 that enhances mosquito infection. Here we report that the same mutation confers NS1 to inhibit interferon-B induction. This mutation enables NS1 binding to TBK1 and reduces TBK1 phosphorylation. Engineering the mutation into a pre-epidemic ZIKV strain debilitates the virus for interferon-B induction; reversing the mutation in an epidemic ZIKV strain invigorates the virus for interferon-B induction; these mutational effects are lost in IRF3-knockout cells. Additionally, ZIKV NS2A, NS2B, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5 can also suppress interferon-B production through targeting distinct components of the RIG-I pathway; however, for these proteins, no antagonistic difference is observed among various ZIKV strains. Our results support the mechanism that ZIKV has accumulated mutation(s) that increases the ability to evade immune response and potentiates infection and epidemics.

Pinar Mesci, Angela Macia, Spencer M. Moore, Sergey A. Shiryaev, Antonella Pinto, Chun-Teng Huang et al. Blocking Zika virus vertical transmission

Abstract
The outbreak of the Zika virus (ZIKV) has been associated with increased incidence of congenital malformations. Although recent efforts have focused on vaccine development, treatments for infected individuals are needed urgently. Sofosbuvir (SOF), an FDA-approved nucleotide analog inhibitor of the Hepatitis C (HCV) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) was recently shown to be protective against ZIKV [infection] both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we show that SOF protected human neural progenitor cells (NPC) and 3D neurospheres from ZIKV infection-mediated cell death and importantly restored the antiviral immune response in NPCs. In vivo, SOF treatment post-infection (p.i.) decreased viral burden in an immunodeficient mouse model. Finally, we show for the 1st time that acute SOF treatment of pregnant dams p.i. was well-tolerated and prevented vertical transmission of the virus to the fetus. Taken together, our data confirmed SOF-mediated sparing of human neural cell types from ZIKV-mediated cell death in vitro and reduced viral burden in vivo in animal models of chronic infection and vertical transmission, strengthening the growing body of evidence for SOF anti-ZIKV activity.
