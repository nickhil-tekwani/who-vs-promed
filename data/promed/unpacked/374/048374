Canola virus spreading to Victoria
---------------------------------
A virus affecting more than 10 000 hectares of South Australian canola crops is making its mark in Victoria. Beet western yellows [see comment below] is an aphid-spread disease that turns green crops brown and leads to yield losses.

Birchip Cropping Group's Simon Craig says farmers are detecting the virus throughout the Wimmera and Mallee [regions of Victoria]. "Different agronomists over the last couple of days say every paddock they've inspected has got signs of the virus to varying degrees. Some paddocks might have only patches, others might see it on every 2nd plant. It's more about the number of plants affected than the total area. I would say that it would be likely that every paddock in the Wimmera-Mallee, to some degree, [is] affected."

South Australian scientists said the spread of the virus was the worst case ever seen in Australia. Farmers have detected the virus in South Australia's Lower North, Mid North and Lower Mallee regions.

Mr Craig says there's little farmers can do to treat affected crops. He says farmers should aim to kill the aphids to stop the spread of the disease.

Canola virus spreads to southern New South Wales
------------------------------------------------
It's hoped recent frosts in south-west New South Wales [NSW] will help destroy aphids that are responsible for spreading a devastating canola disease. Beet western yellows, which has attacked crops in South Australia and Victoria, has also been found in the Riverina [region of NSW].

Dr Kurt Lindbeck, NSW Department of Primary Industries, says there's little point in spraying the affected crops during winter. "While temperatures are cool, we're not going to see much aphid movement. But there is that risk, that as soon as the weather starts to warm up again, the aphids start to multiply.

"We're drawing up some recommendations and management strategies that industry can implement this coming [2014] spring." He says it's not unusual to find beet western yellows in the Riverina; however, a warm autumn and mild start to winter has contributed to higher aphid numbers and earlier rates of infection. "We know that virus infections are most damaging when they occur earlier in the growing season."

[_Beet western yellows virus_ (BWYV; genus _Polerovirus_) affects over 150 species, including crops like beets, lettuce, sunflower, cabbage, bean, pea, chickpeas, tomato, capsicum and cucumber. Poleroviruses are largely confined to phloem tissue, resulting in yellowing symptoms, but may invade non-phloem tissue when co-infecting with, for example, potyviruses. European non-sugar beet infecting strains of BWYV have been reclassified as a separate species, _Turnip yellows virus_ (TuYV), in the genus. TuYV is considered an emerging threat to European oilseed rape production. Outbreaks have been reported, for example, in the UK, and the virus is also known to occur in Australia (ProMED-mail post 20100227.0653). Thus, the current outbreak in Australia may be due to this virus, rather than BWYV.

BWYV and TuYV cause progressive yellowing and loss of plant vigour in most of their hosts. Degree of damage depends upon virulence and persistence of the virus strain, as well as susceptibility of the crop variety.

Both viruses are transmitted by several aphid vectors (including green peach aphid, _Myzus persicae_) in a persistent manner and retained when the insects moult. They have no other means of spread. Disease management may be attempted by controlling vector insects (as suggested in the stories above) and reducing the amount of available reservoir plants. Breeding programmes for TuYV resistant oilseed rape have been established in Europe (see link below).
