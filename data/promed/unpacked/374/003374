The Rift Valley Fever (RVF) outbreak which killed hundreds of people in
parts of Kenya last year [sic has been linked to a virus isolated earlier
in Madagascar. In a letter published last month in The Lancet, French
researchers say that a virus closely related to the one which caused the
Kenyan epidemic had been isolated in Madagascan cattle during a 1990 - 1991
outbreak, indicating that the Kenyan virus was not a completely new variant.
The researchers at the Institute Pasteur de Paris say that the success of
the RVF virus in spreading and adapting to different ecological conditions
called for a more stringent surveillance system to prevent the virus from
spreading further in Africa or to other continents.
During the Kenyan outbreak, more than 10 000 head of livestock were
estimated to have died. There is no vaccine available against the disease,
although the US Army Medical Research Institute (USAMRIID) has reportedly
developed one as part of a controversial programme to protect soldiers and
civilians in the event of biological warfare. USAMRIID reportedly offered
to make the vaccine available to Kenya during last year's outbreak,
provided the Kenyan government made a formal request. The institute said it
was aware that the vaccine was not a "fully validated drug." The Kenyan
government turned down the offer, with a Ministry of Health official saying
that the vaccine was not safe for widespread use.
Other epidemics of Rift Valley Fever have occurred in Egypt, Mauritania and
Madagascar. The Egyptian epidemic occurred in 1970-1978, affecting 18 000
animals, about 600 of which died.
Kenya's outbreak, which later spread to Somalia and Tanzania, was linked
to the flooding associated with the El Nino rains.

[The Kenyan variant was recovered from an area well removed both from the
coast and in time, which would suggest that this 'Madagascar' RVFv strain
is/was already well distributed in East Africa. - Mod.MHJ
