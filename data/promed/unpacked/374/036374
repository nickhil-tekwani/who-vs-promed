[China commendably submits systematic, periodic reports to the OIE on the LPAI H7N9 findings in poultry, including environmental samples. The most recent (13th) follow-up report was submitted on 28 Feb 2014 (see posting 20140302.2309272).

Details on the total number of poultry farms included in the monitoring activities, their geographic distribution, and particularly the respective locations of the 39 backyard farms and 2 commercial farms where, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, positive sera were detected, will be helpful. Have people, in contact with the said (positive) flocks, been serologically tested? - Mod.AS
