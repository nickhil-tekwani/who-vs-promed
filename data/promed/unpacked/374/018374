DENGUE RUMOR FALSE - ARIZONA, USA
=================================
This is in response to [a query by a ProMED subscriber about a]
report [heard elsewhere] of dengue in Southern Arizona:
As far as the Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) and Indian
Health Services (Southern Arizona) are aware, there are no endemic
cases of dengue in Arizona. Occasionally we'll see scattered
imported cases, but have not identified any locally acquired cases.

ADHS has recently (1994 & 1995) found populations of the dengue
vector, Aedes aegypti, in urban areas of Tucson and Nogales in
Southern Arizona. We do not have any information to suggest that
Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are in the Sells area. We have done public
education press releases on breeding control, emphasizing the need to
empty water containers and discard old tires. In some instances
media sources have confused the presence of the disease vector with
the presence of the disease. ADHS has stepped up surveillance for
both the disease and the vector in Southern Arizona, and has provided
information to physicians on diagnosis and reporting.
It is interesting to note that dengue and its vector are considered
endemic in our bordering Mexico state of Sonora. However, to our
knowledge, actual disease transmission has been limited to the
southern half of Sonora. Needless to say, dengue is of particular
interest to us, and we are maintaining active vigilance to detect its
possible presence in Arizona.
As to anybody who is reluctant to travel to Arizona because of
possible dengue, I would have to say, "Come on out, the weather is
beautiful." Dengue season, if dengue were here, wouldn't begin until
later, in the summer (when its not as much fun to be here).
