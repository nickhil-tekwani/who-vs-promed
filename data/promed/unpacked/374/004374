Soup sickens some 115 people in northwest China
----------------------------------------
Some 115 people in northwest China suffered food poisoning -- with 4 in
critical condition -- after eating mutton-and-bun soup, the official Xinhua
News Agency reported Monday.
The victims, customers at a canteen in Qianxian, a county in Shaanxi
province, were rushed to a hospital on Sunday and the shop was shut down,
Xinhua said.
A preliminary investigation showed that the soup, a local delicacy,
contained too much nitrite, which can be used as a food preservative, the
news agency said. It was not immediately clear why nitrite was used in the
soup or whether it was added intentionally. The canteen owner has been
detained by police, Xinhua said.
Some food poisoning cases in China have been blamed on cooks who put
poisons or toxic cleaning materials in food, mistaking them for salt or
other ingredients.

[Addition of nitrite leads to an attractive colour in meat products,
protects against fat oxidation and, in particular, inhibits outgrowth of
_Clostridium_ species. Nitrates and nitrites have long been used as food
preservatives/additives.
Comments on nitrites and infants (Toxic ingestion, sodium nitrite - USA
(New York) (02) 20020523.4301): "Preserved meats such as ham, lunch meats,
bacon, and hot dogs are high in nitrates and nitrites and should never be
pureed and added to baby food for young infants. Further, foods containing
these products should not be saved in the refrigerator for older infants."
Processed meats, with the exception of dry sausage (salami, pepperoni,
etc.) and dry-cured hams, use only sodium nitrite and not nitrates. The
usage level of sodium nitrite is limited in the United States in all meat
products to 156 parts per million (ppm) sodium nitrite based on meat
weight. In meat, the nitrite is bound to the myoglobin in the meat and
would therefore not be an issue in methemoglobinemia.
Methemoglobinemia is the primary adverse health effect associated with
human exposure to nitrate or nitrite. Generally, to cause
methemoglobinemia, nitrate must be converted to nitrite. But in this case
it appears too much nitrite was initially added. Nitrite causes the
oxidation of normal hemoglobin to methemoglobin, which is unable to
transport oxygen from lungs to tissues. Bacteria in the gastrointestinal
system mediate the conversion of nitrate to nitrite. Consequently the risk
of methemoglobinemia from ingestion of nitrate depends not only on the dose
of nitrate by also on the number and type of enteric bacteria. However, in
this case, the nitrite was apparently added directly.
Low levels of methemoglobin occur in healthy individuals, with typical
values ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 percent. While methemoglobinemia can be
clinically diagnosed at levels of 1 percent, methemoglobin levels up to 10
percent are generally not considered adverse. At levels above 10 percent,
methemoglobinemia causes cyanosis, and at higher concentrations, asphyxia.
