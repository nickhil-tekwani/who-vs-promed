Ghana investigates bird flu case
--------------------------------
Information reaching Joy News says the Veterinary Services Department
of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture is investigating a case of
bird flu infection in Ghana. A discovery was said to have been made
at the port city of Tema. [East of Accra, a map is available at:
http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/ghana_pol_1995.pdf>].
Joy News sources at the Veterinary Services Department say even
though initial checks suggest it might be bird flu, further checks
will be needed for a definite conclusion to be reached. According to
the sources a blood specimen is being readied for analysis at the
World Health Organisation's laboratories in Italy. Bird flu is a
deadly strain of a virus that attacks poultry and kills them after a
short period.
There is presently a ban on the importation of poultry and poultry
products including feathers into Ghana from countries that have
previously reported infections including Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Cote
d'Ivoire, Egypt and Niger.
Meanwhile a 4-day forum has been held at Jema in the Kintampo South
District of Brong Ahafo to sensitise 45 assembly members and heads of
department on the Avian Influenza. The forum, organized by the
Kintampo South District Agricultural Development Unit of the Ministry
of Food and Agriculture, would enable the participants to keep
surveillance on the disease and help in its prevention.
Mr. John Kweku Appiah, district director of the ministry, explained
that the forum was meant to reinforce public awareness about the bird
flu so they could collaborate with agricultural extension officers to
detect, prevent and control the disease. Mr. Appiah advised the
general public to properly boil and cook eggs before consumption and
advised the participants to educate their people to report symptoms
of any strange disease among their birds to the veterinary services.
Mr. Yaw Adjei-Duffour, district chief executive, expressed regret
about how the poultry industry nearly collapsed some years back
because of rumours that the disease had been detected in the country.
He appealed to the participants to help erase any wrong perceptions
about the disease in the communities. He advised the youth to go into
poultry keeping to improve their livelihood.
