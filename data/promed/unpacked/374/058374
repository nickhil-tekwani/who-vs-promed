[1] Possible cholera - Papua New Guinea (Madang)
Date: Tue 29 Jun 2010

Papua New Guineans have been sternly urged to forego all burial
rituals when handling bodies of relatives who have succumbed to
cholera. The warning is from Bogia's program manager health Camillus
Dugumi following the deaths of 15 people, some of whom are understood
to have died while mourning over their loved ones who had died from
this fast-acting sickness.

When contacted by the Post-Courier, Mr Dugumi could not state how
many of the deaths had been as a result of direct contact with the
dead but said the deaths had been recorded over a 10-day period
ending yesterday, 28 Jun 2010. He said those who had died were all
from Dugulava village on Manam Island and that 2 of them were
children.

Reports received by the Post-Courier were that the deaths were not
related to cholera as some of those who died did not present the
usual clinical symptoms of cholera including acute severe watery
diarrhea. Rather, they had complained of feeling cold from the soles
of the feet, and the sensation working its way up the legs and to the
rest of their body, including the stomach. They also complained of
feeling intense hunger and the coldness eventually getting to them
before collapsing and dying.

However, Dugumi said an outbreak of this disease [cholera? - Mod.LL]
had recently been reported on the island, especially in the affected
village, where many had just been repatriated following the Tobenam
incident on the north coast of Madang, where many Manams fleeing
volcanic eruptions were living.

[Severe cholera, although relatively rare, can cause rapidly
progressive illness with death even without diarrhea if fluid is
rapidly secreted into the bowel with severe hypovolemia occurring
prior to the onset of diarrhea. This process can be called cholera
sicca or dry cholera. - Mod.LL]

Yesterday [2 Jul 2010], Dr Nguyen Thanh Dan, Director of Ca Mau
Province Preventive Medicine Center, said 2 children who are 4 and 2
years old, siblings from Dinh Thanh commune, Dong Hai district, Bac
Lieu province, were confirmed positive for _V. cholerae_. These 2
cases are the 1st cases of cholera reported in Ca Mau province.

The same day [2 Jul 2010], Vo Huy Danh, Deputy Director of An Giang
Province Preventive Medicine center, confirmed 2 more cases of acute
diarrhea positive for _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 Ogawa. These patients were
from Vinh Thanh commune, Chau Thanh district and My Thoi Ward, Long
Xuyen City. In June 2010, An Giang province reported 10 confirmed and
1 suspected case of cholera.

[4] Cholera - Viet Nam (north)

Cholera has broken out again in the northern region, the Health
Ministry's Department of Preventive Medicine announced on 3 Jul 2010.
The National Hospital for Tropical Diseases is treating 36 people
infected with acute diarrhea, with 18 of them having tested positive
for cholera.

The hospital director, Nguyen Van Kinh, revealed that most of the
patients are from inner Hanoi. 2 patients have suffered kidney
failure because they were hospitalized too late, he noted. According
to a recent report, most of the patients with cholera consumed
unhygienic foods.

According to a recent study by the Preventive Health Department and
the Central Institute for Epidemiology, the bacterium that has been
causing cholera in Viet Nam since 2007 is growing more toxic and
dangerous. The current strain of _Vibrio cholerae_ type O1 is
different from that which caused the acute intestinal disease in Viet
Nam before 2007, adding that the new type has a far longer lifespan
in the environment. The current strain in Viet Nam is similar to the
one that caused a pandemic in Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand.

[5] Acute watery diarrhea - Cambodia (Ratanakkiri)

At least 3 deaths in Ratanakkiri province due to acute watery
diarrhea have been reported in recent days, health officials said
yesterday [4 Jul 2010], bringing the total number of people who have
died in the province since April [2010] to 32.

Tha Bunthak, deputy director of the provincial Health Department,
said officials had recorded 3 new deaths in Ta Veng and O'Chum
districts. These included a 50-year-old woman who died last Monday
[28 Jun 2010] as well as a 20-year-old man who died on Friday [2 Jul
2010].

Since April [2010], the province had recorded 1300 cases of acute
diarrhea, he said, and added that the current outbreak appeared to be
the most significant in Ratanakkiri since 1999, when 100 people died.

"Diarrhea is seriously affecting people in this province," said Tha
Bunthak, who blamed the cases on poor sanitation.

Meanwhile, Svay Rieng provincial hospital had experienced a new
outbreak of acute diarrhea, with 15 patients being admitted since
Wednesday [30 Jun 2010] with serious cases, said Kuch Sipha, the
hospital's deputy superintendent. Kuch Sipha said doctors had
concluded that the patients contracted diarrhea because of a lack of
proper sanitation that led some villagers to consume contaminated
water.

Officials with the Health Ministry's Department of Communicable
Disease Control could not be reached for comment yesterday [4 Jul
2010].

Dr Nima Asgari, a public health specialist working for the World
Health Organisation, said he did not have immediate access to
statistics for cholera or diarrhea cases nationwide.

He said, though, that he had seen a general increase in cases this
year [2010] over last year [2009]. "We do know that there is just
more going around this year [2010]; that's for sure," Asgari said.

Diarrhea outbreaks have been blamed in part on the late dry season,
when communal water sources are used frequently and clean rainwater
is not readily available.

But it was possible that improved surveillance methods were
contributing to the increase in reported diarrhea cases this year
[2010], Asgari said.

[6] Cholera - Thailand

<http://www.thaivisa.com/forum/topic/379099-dengue-and-cholera-outbreaks-in-thailand-bring-warnings-after-30-die/>


Minister Jurin Laksanawisit ordered public health officials to
monitor the spread of cholera after reports of 5 deaths. 3 cases were
in Pattani and the rest in Songkhla and Tak.

Officials reported 982 people infected by the food-borne disease
during the past 6 months [January-June 2010]. Among the infected, 708
were Thai, and 274 migrant workers.

The South region has the highest number of people infected with
cholera with 505 cases, followed by the North with 279, the Northeast
with 166, and the Central region with 32 cases.

A cholera outbreak in 2007 infected 986 people and 7 people died. The
number of infections was reduced in 2008 to 200, and in 2009 to 300
cases, with 2-3 deaths a year.

The Public Health Ministry has issued a warning to people to protect
themselves from infection by eating cooked and hot food, using a
middle spoon [a serving spoon to avoid everyone dipping their own
spoon into a communal bowl, thus spreading the bacteria], and washing
hands frequently.

For exported food products, Department of Disease Control's
director-general Dr Manit Teeratantikanont said the department had
strictly checked bacterial contamination among exports. Any food
products with bacteria contamination would not be allowed to leave
the country.

[7] Cholera, refugees - Thailand-Myanmar border

89 refugees in Mae La Refugee Camp have been infected with cholera in
2 weeks and the number of cases is increasing, a source in Mae La
Refugee Camp said on Friday, 11 Jun 2010. No deaths have been
reported.

"Since 27 May [2010], 87 refugees have been infected, and now another
2 patients arrived at the hospital," said Saw Nay Hsei, a health care
coordinator at the Mae La Camp Hospital. The disease is concentrated
in 3 areas of the camp.

As of Thu 10 Jun 2010, 72 patients had been discharged from the
hospital and 15 patients remain in the Cholera Treatment Center
(CTC), he said.

Most of the patients were infected with the disease by drinking water
collected from local wells and streams. Restaurants and food vendors
in the camp have been banned until authorities can ensure that sites
are hygienic and proper procedures are put in place.

Mae La is the largest of 7 refugee camps along the Thai-Burma
[Myanmar] border where nearly 40 000 refugees live. Most of the
refugees in Mae La Camp are Karen [ethnic minority].

According to the Mae La Camp Hospital, 28 people were infected by
cholera in 2007.

The village is over 500 km [310 mi] south of state capital Raipur.

"The deaths were reported in the past 2 or 3 days. But more
information will be available only when our medical team meets the
