An outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) has been declared in the state [Sarawak, Malaysia], with the Health Department beefing up efforts to curb the spread of the contagious disease.

In confirming this outbreak on 12 Mar 2015, Sarawak health director Datu Dr Zulkifli said most of the cases occurred in Kuching, Miri and Sibu. Kuching district had the highest cumulative cases at 787, followed by Miri (672) and Sibu (663), he disclosed. Until early March 2015, he said 631 cases of HFMD were recorded, while the cumulative figure for Sarawak stood at 3631 thus far.

"The HFMD situation in Sarawak is stable and under control, and the department is mounting efforts to curb the spread of the disease. HFMD is said to be at the outbreak level in the state if there are 365 cases reported per week for the state," Dr Zulkifli told The Borneo Post. He said this when asked about the total number of cases for a place to be declared an HFMD outbreak area. He attributed the larger population in Kuching, Miri and Sibu as among the causative factors for the higher numbers of cases recorded in these places.

Meanwhile, he stressed it is imperative for teachers in nurseries and kindergartens to monitor entry at the gates to prevent sick pre-schoolers from entering the classroom. "Teachers also need to check the children for symptoms of HFMD and have the classrooms cleaned daily."

Among the symptoms of HFMD are fever, sore throat, mouth ulcers on the inside of the mouth or sides of the tongue, rash (flat or raised spots) or small blisters on palms of hands, soles of feet, and/or buttocks, lethargy and poor appetite. He reiterated that parents need to seek immediate medical attention for their child if she or he exhibits any of these symptoms.

Meanwhile, the person-in-charge of a kindergarten here, Yii Yiew Yieng, said they had been advised by the department to take precautionary measures against HFMD since the start of 2015. Yii said that they carry out stringent checks on every preschooler before allowing them into the class and would notify parents if their children display HFMD symptoms. "We then ask their parents to seek immediate medical attention for them," she added.

Yii said they would intensify checks if they detect symptoms of HFMD among their pupils. "Since 2000, our teachers have been taking stringent measures to keep the disease at bay. They will ask children to open their mouth, including checking palms for HFMD symptoms," she added.

Meanwhile, Dr Zulkifli said no preschools in the state were closed thus far this year [2015] due to HFMD.

[Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is a common infectious disease of infants and children. The symptoms commonly observed include fever, painful sores in the mouth, and a rash with blisters on hands, feet, and also buttocks. HFMD is most commonly caused by coxsackievirus A16, which usually results in a mild, self-limiting disease with a few complications. HFMD is also caused by other enteroviruses, including enterovirus 71 (EV71), which in large outbreaks in southeastern Asia has been associated with serious complications in certain groups and may cause deaths.

HFMD mainly occurs among children under 10 years old. The usual period from infection to onset of symptoms is 3-7 days. The disease usually begins with fever, poor appetite, malaise, and frequently with a sore throat. One or 2 days after fever onset, painful sores develop in the mouth. They begin as small red spots that blister and then often become ulcers. They are usually located on the tongue, gums and inside of the cheeks. A non-itchy skin rash develops over 1-2 days with flat or raised red spots, some with blisters. The rash is usually located on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet and may also appear on the buttocks and/or genitalia. A person with HFMD may not have symptoms or may have only the rash or only mouth ulcers. In a small number of cases, children may experience a brief febrile illness, present with mixed neurological and respiratory symptoms, and succumb rapidly from the disease.

HFMD virus is contagious, and infection is spread from person to person by direct contact with nose or throat discharges, saliva, fluid from blisters, or the stool of infected persons. Infected persons are most contagious during the 1st week of the illness, but the period of communicability can last for several weeks. HFMD is not transmitted from pets or other animals. HFMD should not be confused with the different disease in animals called foot-and-mouth disease.

Presently, there is no specific treatment available for HFMD. Patients should drink plenty of water or other liquids and may require treatment of the symptoms. Health care providers are advised to treat patients according to their symptoms and to refrain from using steroids. - Mod.LL
