Benue state government, Monday [16 Nov 2020], confirmed that the strange ailment that recently claimed 20 lives in Okpeilo-Otukpa community in Ogbadibo Local Government Area [LGA] of Benue State was yellow fever. The commissioner for Information, Culture and Tourism, Mrs Ngunan Addingi who made the confirmation in Makurdi while briefing reporters at the end of the weekly State Executive Council, EXCO, meeting presided over by governor Samuel Ortom, explained that the blood samples taken to the National Reference Laboratory in Abuja confirmed the diagnosis.

The commissioner said the government had directed that the entire Ogbadibo LGA be vaccinated to prevent further spread and loss of lives in the area.

[The 20 fatal cases reported as suspected yellow fever (YF) yesterday (15 Nov 2020) have now been laboratory confirmed as YF. The earlier report indicated that the 20 cases included 19 males and a female, all aged between 7 and 40. The Benue state epidemiologist also reported that 26 people, 2 females and 24 males, had fallen ill with the sickness. He also indicated that the state is planning to initiate a yellow fever campaign (see Yellow fever - Africa (16): Nigeria (BE) susp. 20201115.7945914). One hopes that the campaign will be initiated very soon. YF outbreaks can quickly get out of hand.

YF transmission is also active in 3 other Nigerian states currently (see Yellow fever - Africa (15): Nigeria (BA, DE, EN) 20201110.7930007). - Mod.TY
