New assessment of Kawasaki disease in children in Hong Kong
-----------------------------------------------------------
HONG KONG: About 500 children in the Special Administrative Region in the
past 5 years have been stricken with Kawasaki disease, a little-understood
[disease that is the commonest cause of acquired heart disease in children
under 5, a study group has found. The group was set up this year by the
Queen Elizabeth Hospital to study local cases and problems associated with
the disease, named after the Japanese doctor who discovered it.
Dr Lee Shuk-shan, a senior medical officer at the hospital, said that among
local children with the disease, 10 to 20 per cent had developed coronary
heart disease, a lifelong affliction. She said Japan has the highest rate
of Kawasaki victims, where it affects more than 100 000 children, striking
at about the age of 1 year. The [rate is also quite high among Chinese,
but Kawasaki disease is uncommon among Caucasians. Dr Lee said the cause of
the disease is still being determined. Most children recover in 3 weeks,
but about 3 per cent die from arterial blood clots. Overseas experts
believe Kawasaki is caused by [a group B coxsackie virus, but this has not
been confirmed.
Dr Lee said Hong Kong doctors, especially pediatricians, were now more
alert to the disease than they were 5 years ago. But parents of afflicted
children often did not know about the disease and even some doctors were
not well informed. Dr Lee said that if the disease was not treated in time,
5 to 20 per cent of patients might develop coronary heart disease.

[It is still debatable whether Kawasaki disease can be regarded as an
emerging disease. Professor Kawasaki himself has written recently (Acta
Paediatr Taiwan 2001; 42(1): 8-10) that: "Because the etiology of Kawasaki
disease is still unknown, it cannot yet be called a disease entity but
[must still regarded as a clinical entity. We must await the discovery of
the etiology before we can make a definite statement whether or not
Kawasaki disease is a new disease."
On the other hand, in a recent review (Clin Exp Dermatol 2001; 26(1):
6-12), Nasr and colleagues state that:"Kawasaki disease is one of the
commonest vasculitides seen in children. It presents with prolonged fever
and a polymorphic exanthem. It is a major cause of acquired heart disease
in western society. Its exact cause is not known, but exposure to a
superantigen has been suggested as a possible aetiological factor.
Diagnosis of Kawasaki disease still relies on clinical criteria and
investigations are done mainly to exclude other diseases and to detect
early or established cardiac complications. Coronary complications can be
reduced significantly by the use of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy
combined with oral aspirin. The serious consequences of Kawasaki disease
require a heightened awareness of this condition when dealing with
childhood exanthems." - Mod.CP
