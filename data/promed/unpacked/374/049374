Cattle have tested positive for anthrax in southwestern North Dakota,
the 1st case in the state this year [2009]. State Veterinarian Susan
Keller says the case was reported along the Hettinger-Slope county
line. She says it's the 1st confirmed case in that region in several
years.

Anthrax usually appears in very wet or very dry conditions, when
dormant bacteria spores in the soil are disturbed. Animals that
consume the spores are exposed to the disease.

Keller says ranchers who find dead livestock should consult their
veterinarians before disposing of the carcasses. Keller says more than
500 confirmed animal deaths from anthrax were reported in North Dakota
during an outbreak in 2005.

We had our 1st confirmed case of anthrax this year [2009] in North
Dakota. Testing was by PCR. Animal losses occurred in New England
where 5 cows and 2 calves died. They were described as "grazing on
short pasture."

New England is in Hettinger county on the Cannonball River, an old hot
spot for anthrax in the state. We haven't had too many cases from that
region lately, but are not surprised to see it surface there again.

From my records, we had cases in southwest ND in '90, '91 and '93.
Then there was a long absence of the disease until 2007, when a single
case showed up in west central, not southwest, ND. Nothing since then.

We have had confirmed cases in that area in the past. The local
veterinarian said about 9 years ago, and our office has record of a
case in 2000 which was south quite a distance and in a different
drainage area of the county. There are always deaths that are not
necropsied, so the potential for other unconfirmed cases in the area
in more recent years (even this year [2009]) is very possible.

Calf cases are really not unusual in ND, especially in 2005. Calves
that die are not always necropsied either until the number becomes
beyond the normal death loss percentage for that herd. Cow deaths are
more alarming, but producers almost expect some death loss of calves
on pasture.

The deaths were on a harvested wheat field and the grazing of short
green re-growth, and this is what the practitioner logically assumed
caused the exposure.

The weather in ND varies dramatically from winter to spring to summer,
and this year [2009] was no exception. They may have had more rain
than normal, but some folks would tell you that now it is dry, and
they could use more. Rains are [spotty] often in that area of the state.

Yes, we have tabanid flies, and I've already visited with the
practitioner to discuss vaccination with other producers in the area.
An e-mail containing the information in [a] news release was also sent
to all veterinarians in the state.

Despite Dr. Charlie's early warnings this year [2009], I would assume
that most in the current vicinity did not vaccinate since they've not
had a confirmed case in recent years.

We continue to encourage producers to view anthrax just as they do
clostridial diseases and vaccinate if in a known endemic area.

[I spoke with Charlie Stoltenow, ND Senior Extension Veterinarian, and
very knowledgeable about this disease in North Dakota. The herd was
not vaccinated. This producer had not seen anthrax before in this
area. Because of the winter flooding in eastern ND, the pressure had
been there to get stock vaccinated, and so far it seems to be very
successful there. But in the meanwhile behind everyone's backs, this
sporadic outbreak occurred, as they do. A lesson to keep in mind about
the importance of vaccinating in the vicinity of past outbreaks, but
with a gap of some 16 years, not vaccinating for this disease is
understandable.

If the weather in SW North Dakota had been as Dr. Keller implied,
there would have been adequate tabanid flies to take advantage of
these 6 moribund cows to spread the infection to surrounding ranches,
which is why we encourage ranchers to vaccinate their stock even if
they have never seen the disease on their place; because if their
neighbour is unobservant, it will come at them over the ranch fences
on the dirty bloody mouthparts of those hungry haemophagic female
biting flies.

My good friend Mike Vickers told me some years ago of his experience
of this disease in a sporadic zone of south Texas. Yes, it occurs in
hot dry summers -- this challenging weather reduces the innate
resistance of the livestock -- but in his experience, it would occur
after a brief shower, and 10 days later he would get reports of dead
cattle and deer. Logically, the shower encourages forage growth, and
this fosters grazing in low lying areas that collect rain and have
more growth than where it drains off quickly. Grazing in these areas
includes eating soil. I have heard the same comment from others and in
the literature, e.g. Rocky Mountain Lodge in Alberta in 1999 (see
postings listed below). And to quote Charlie again: "As for weather,
we had some pretty warm temperatures leading up to this event."

If anthrax had not been seen in SW North Dakota since 1990-93 and if
this rancher had not "seen" it before on his place, it is not unlikely
that it had been occurring unobserved in the area and put down to any
of the more common diseases including clostridia, bloat, plant
poisonings, whatever. "6 adult deaths and 2 calves" triggered a
veterinarian visit and the diagnosis. Single dead cows don't. Then
there is the possibility of unobserved wildlife deaths. All of which
result in continued soil contamination.

The other puzzling fact is that they were grazing a recently harvested
wheat field. Benyamin Cherkasskiy reported that the Soviets
successfully dealt with contaminated fields (_champs maudit_ in
classical terms) by ploughing and sowing them with various crops,
grains and fescue among others -- it didn't really matter what -- and
in 2-3 years, the field would be safe for grazing livestock. Which
would suggest a source outside the field. At this time, there are no
reports of earth moving on this ranch; this can and does result in
forgotten old cattle graves being upturned and once deeply-buried
spores being in the grazing.

And lastly, if you suspect anthrax do *not* necropsy the carcass. Take
a cotton swab, and dip it in the animal's blood, and send that to your
diagnostic laboratory. An opened carcass awaiting a laboratory result
will become a monster source of anthrax spores.

I am very grateful to Susan Keller, Neil Dyer and Charlie Stoltenow
for their valuable and informed help.

New England is in SW ND, virtually at the opposite end of the state
for the usual anthrax activity in the counties on the eastern border
of ND. To see a map of North Dakota, go to:
