Thailand suspects new outbreak of bird flu
-----------------------------------------------
Thailand suspects a new outbreak of bird flu at a farm in a central
province where thousands of chickens have died, the deputy agriculture
minister said on Tue 6 Jul 2004.
"I have received reports that there are suspected bird flu cases in
Ayutthaya province, and the result of lab tests will be confirmed in the
next couple of days,'' Newin Chidchob told reporters. "It is possible that
the outbreak will return.''
An outbreak in Ayutthaya would be the 2nd since the government declared, on
14 May 2004, that it was all but certain that Thailand was free of the
disease following widespread outbreaks earlier in 2004.
An isolated outbreak in northern Chiang Mai province in late May 2004 also
raised alarms. The deadly strain of bird flu that swept through 10 Asian
nations earlier in 2004
killed, or forced the cull of, more than 100 million poultry. It killed
more than 37 million birds in Thailand alone, where it also jumped to
humans and killed 8 people.
An additional 16 people died in Vietnam.
Chickens at the afflicted farm in Ayutthaya began to die about 2 weeks ago
[last 2 weeks of Jun 2004], farm owner Veera Sripramong said. Officials
from the local Livestock Office visited his farm and told him to cull all
of his 43 000 chickens.
"They ordered me to kill all chickens, but I don't have enough manpower, so
I will do what I can,'' Veera told The Associated Press in a telephone
interview.
He said about 7000 chickens have died during the past 2 weeks.
Chalit Seenimanomai, the chief of the Livestock Office in Ayutthaya, said
that, by law, all chickens in a radius of 3 miles around the affected farm
would have to be destroyed. Fortunately, there are no other farms in that
area, he said.
Small-scale outbreaks of bird flu also have been reported in neighboring
Vietnam during the 3 months since the country declared itself free of the
disease.
Thailand was about to declare itself completely free of bird flu earlier in
2004 but held off, after a warning by the World Health Organization that
such a declaration would be premature.
