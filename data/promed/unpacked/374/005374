Annual report of the Australian Meningococcal Surveillance Programme, 1997
- The Australian Meningococcal Surveillance Programme. Commun Dis Itell
1998;22:205-211.
Abstract: The National _Neisseria_ Network (NNN) has undertaken
meningococcal isolate surveillance by means of a collaborative laboratory
based initiative since 1994. The phenotype (serogroup, serotype and
serosubtype) and antibiotic susceptibility of 343 isolates of _Neisseria
meningitidis_ from invasive cases of meningococcal disease were determined
in 1997. Ninety six percent of the invasive isolates were serogroup B or C.
Serogroup B strains predominated in all States and Territories and were
isolated from sporadic cases of invasive disease. Phenotypes B:4:P1.4 and
B:15:P1.7 were prominent.
Serogroup C isolates were most often encountered in New South Wales,
especially in adolescents and young adults, and in that State were nearly
as numerous as serogroup B strains. C:2a:P1.5 was the most frequently
encountered phenotype and C:2b:P1.2 strains were also distributed widely. A
number of clusters of cases of serogroup C disease were noted, mainly with
phenotype C:2a:P1.5. About three-quarters of all isolates showed decreased
susceptibility to the penicillin group of antibiotics (MIC 0.06 to 0.5
mg/L). Three isolates showed reduced susceptibility to rifampicin and one
was chloramphenicol resistant.
