The New York City Department of Health has issued a new vaccination recommendation for men at risk of contracting a serious and potentially deadly strain of meningitis.

The outbreak of meningitis among gay men has sickened 4 people already this year [2013], increasing the number of cases to 17 since 2012, according to city health officials. 7 fatalities have been reported in the city since 2010.

"Once you get infected the time from being infected to being horribly sick and possibly dying is very short," Deputy Health Commissioner Dr Jay Varma told WCBS 880's Alex Silverman on Wednesday [6 Mar 2013]. "We've had several cases who have been actually found dead in their apartment before they'd even gone to see a medical provider. So that is, to us, absolutely terrifying."

But now the city says all men who are intimate with other men they've met on a website, or an app, or at a bar, or a party need to get vaccinated now. "We think that people who are in these risk groups should be taking this very, very seriously," said Varma. "Probably all of us have people that fall potentially within this risk group. Vaccination is the best defense. I urge all men who meet these criteria -- regardless of whether they identify as gay -- to get vaccinated now and protect themselves from this disease before it is too late," added Health Commissioner Dr Thomas Farley.

Symptoms of meningitis are: high fever, headache, stiff neck, and rash that develop rapidly upon onset, according to the health department. Symptoms may appear 2 to 10 days after exposure, but usually within 5 days. Anyone experiencing these symptoms is advised to seek immediate medical care.

Men who meet the vaccination criteria are urged to get the shot from their health care provider. Health Department clinics are also offering the meningitis vaccine to those who cannot get the shot from a doctor.

[The news release above is an update on the outbreak of invasive meningococcal disease among men who have sex with men (MSM) in New York City that was reported last year [2012] in a ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (02): (NY) fatal, MSM 20120929.1315676.

_Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of invasive meningococcal disease (meningitis and sepsis), is transmitted from person to person via droplets of respiratory secretions mostly from asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers of the microorganism. It is estimated that between 10 to 25 per cent of the population carry _N. meningitidis_ at any given time, and the carriage rate may be much higher in epidemic situations. Close and prolonged contact (such as kissing, sneezing, and coughing on someone), living in close quarters or dormitories (military recruits, students), sharing eating or drinking utensils, etc. facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period for meningococcal meningitis is 4 days, ranging between 2 and 10 days (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/). Invasive meningococcal disease carries a high mortality rate if untreated. Even with early and appropriate treatment, patients can die within 24-48 hours.

At least 13 serogroups, based on polysaccharide capsular antigens, have been described: 5 serogroups (A, B, C, Y, and W-135) most commonly cause human disease. Molecular epidemiology has revealed that most cases of invasive meningococcal disease are caused by only a few clonal lineages, whereas the genetic diversity is higher in meningococci recovered from healthy carriers (Claus H, Weinand H, Frosch M, Vogel U: Identification of the Hypervirulent Lineages of _Neisseria meningitidis_, the ST-8 and ST-11 Complexes, by Using Monoclonal Antibodies Specific to NmeDI. J Clin Microbiol. 2003 August; 41(8): 3873-6; available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC179822/). However, less virulent strains have been reported to cause invasive meningococcal disease in immune-compromised HIV-infected patients (Ferreira de Andrade C, Cotrim da Cunha D, Cavalcanti V, de Filippis I: Fatal meningococcal meningitis in a HIV-infected patient caused by serogroup C _Neisseria meningitidis_ belonging to the non-hypervirulent clonal complex ST-60 (cc60). Braz J Infect Dis 2011; 15 (2): 178-80; available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1413-86702011000200017).

We are not told in the news report above or in previous news reports if there is any link among the 17 cases, other than they were men who have sex with men. A prior health department news release said that 4 men who died also were HIV infected. Serogroup C _N. meningitidis_ accounts for most US outbreaks (Woods CW, Rosenstein NE, Perkins BA: _Neisseria meningitidis_ outbreaks in the United States 1994-1997 (Abstract). In: Proceedings of Annual Meeting of IDSA. 12-15 Nov 1998. Denver, Colorado. Alexandria (VA): Infectious Disease Society of America; 1998). However, we are not told the serotypes of the meningococcal organisms involved in this outbreak in New York City; or if the serotypes were the same, or whether the isolates have the same genotype.

We are also not told the CD4 counts in the patients who had HIV co-infection. Severely immunosuppressed patients with HIV infection and a low CD4 cell count of less than or equal to 200/mm3 are likely to be at greater risk of developing invasive meningococcal disease (Domingo P, Suarez-Lozano I, Torres F, et al: Bacterial Meningitis in HIV-1-Infected Patients in the Era of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 2009 Aug 15; 51(5): 582-7; available at http://www.researchgate.net/publication/26279285_Bacterial_meningitis_in_HIV-1-infected_patients_in_the_era_of_highly_active_antiretroviral_therapy).

The primary method for preventing sporadic meningococcal disease is chemoprophylaxis with antibiotics, such as rifampin, ciprofloxacin, or ceftriaxone, of close contacts after a case is identified. The risk of acquiring meningococcal disease is 500-800 times greater among close contacts than among the total population (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm). Close contacts of patients are considered to be household members, day-care center contacts, and other persons directly exposed to the patient's oral secretions. Administering chemoprophylaxis to persons who are not close contacts of patients usually is not recommended. Neither oropharyngeal nor nasopharyngeal cultures for _N. meningitidis_ are useful in deciding who should receive chemoprophylaxis.

A mass vaccination campaign has been used to control invasive meningococcal disease outbreaks in the USA (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2738498/) and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has released recommendations for the use of meningococcal vaccine to control outbreaks of serogroup C meningococcal disease (CDC. Control and prevention of serogroup C meningococcal disease: evaluation and management of suspected outbreaks: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). MMWR Recomm Rep. 1997 Feb 14; 46(RR-5): 13-21; available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm).
