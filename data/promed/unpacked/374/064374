I have read the message posted by Dr. Ronald Gold. I would like to point out
some clarifications of the problem:
1. The Cuban BC vaccine was tested in Iceland with another biological made in
Norway under supervision of CDC and WHO.
2. To my knowledge, the vaccine confers cross immunity as it was demonstrated
in Brasil, Argentina, Colombia among others.
3. It would be extremely useful that any questions about this vaccine be
submitted to Instituto Finlay, La Habana, Cuba; in order to get the most
specific and accurate information about this topic. In fact, this vaccine,
according to some publications has the greatest efficacy rate (>84%).
4. The e-mail address of Instituto Finlay is
<finlayci@infomed.sld.cu>
