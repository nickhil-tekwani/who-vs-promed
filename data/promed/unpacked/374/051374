Feds Prepare for Smallpox Quarantine
--------------------------------------
ATLANTA -- Federal health officials are quietly making plans for
quarantining Americans who might be exposed to a highly contagious smallpox
patient, addressing sensitive questions of how to hold people, possibly
against their will, in case of a bioterror attack.
The planning, still in draft form, addresses complex logistical and policy
questions, including where people would be kept while waiting for officials
to confirm a smallpox case and, if necessary, administer vaccinations.
``It's not pretty to think through these type of doomsday scenarios, but
it's important to start to put yourself there and imagine things unfolding
if you want to anticipate how to react,'' said Dr. Marty Cetron, a
quarantine expert at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Within the next few weeks, the plan will be circulated among top federal
officials and others involved in the preparation, said Cetron, who
co-chairs a CDC working group on the issue.
The group began with this scenario: Officials get word that an
international flight is headed for the United States with a
smallpox-infected passenger aboard. The case would be fairly easy because
the people would be in one place and health officials wouldn't have to
track them down.
Still, if the passengers weren't held for treatment, CDC experts estimate
that a plane filled with 500 people including one with smallpox could
result in dozens, maybe hundreds, of sick people, including passengers on
the plane who got sick and the people they would infect.
The vaccine is only effective within 4 days of someone being exposed to
smallpox, so if people leave the scene it would be difficult to find them
in time.
Under the plan, officials would stress that people would be better off
staying in quarantine because that's where the vaccine and other
medications would be available. That's a big change from past centuries,
when people in quarantine were written off, Cetron said.
"All the goodies will be delivered inside the box," he said. "It's a
fundamental difference to spend as much, if not more attention, on
monitoring and preserving the health on the people inside the box."
Once planning is complete for this scenario, the CDC group plans to tackle
more complicated situations, such as a smallpox patient in a sports stadium
or an infected person wandering through an airport.
Smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980, but samples of the deadly virus
still exist in both the United States and Russia. Bioterrorism experts
consider the possibility of a smallpox attack one of the most frightening,
albeit unlikely, threats because one infected patient could infect many others.
Routine immunizations against smallpox in the United States ended in 1972,
meaning many Americans have no protection against the disease. Federal
officials are now considering vaccinating as many as 500 000 health care
workers and emergency personnel who would be first to see any smallpox
case. But because the vaccine carries significant risks, including death,
officials do not want to resume mass vaccinations, a point President Bush
made Monday.
"I worry about calling for a national vaccination program and that it could
cause a loss of life," Bush said at a White House news conference.
Rather, the plan is to vaccinate others only if they are exposed to the
virus, or exposed to someone who is exposed. Another alternative, one
endorsed Monday in a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences, would be mass vaccinating all Americans if a smallpox case
emerged. The authors of that study predicted significantly fewer people
would die using a mass vaccination strategy.
The airliner scenario is not entirely fictitious. In December 2001, a
flight from Taiwan bound for Newark, N.J., was delayed for about 4 hours in
Seattle after an anonymous tipster told U.S. Customs Service agents that a
passenger had smallpox. It turned out to be a hoax, but the situation
provided a real-life example of how people on the plane reacted.
"People got really scared because they sat there on a plane for 2 hours
without any idea what was going on," said Kristy Lillibridge, an
epidemiologist who is part of the CDC working group.
The draft CDC plan calls for taking the airplane to a hangar or another
facility where passengers can get off without going into the airport, she
said. The suspicious passenger would be isolated from the others, but
everyone would be kept in quarantine while officials did tests to determine
if the passenger was in fact infected with smallpox.
Still unresolved: how long to keep people if a smallpox exposure is
confirmed. Options include one to 2 days, or long enough to give the shots;
7 days, long enough to see if the vaccination worked; or 17 days, when no
one would be contagious anymore.
"It is such a sensitive topic. Those kinds of decisions, to actually use a
quarantine, will be made at very high levels," Cetron said.
Other elements of the plan, officials said, include:
--If possible, diverting the flight to one of 8 international airports
where the CDC has quarantine operations in place, or to another airport
where the local public health authorities are prepared to handle the case.
--Creating clear messages and announcements to deliver to passengers,
including those that would be read by the pilot while they are still on the
plane.
--Providing beds, restrooms, food and access to medication for anyone in
quarantine.

[After the incident with the case of chickenpox on the flight from Taiwan
to Newark, the need for a protocol for management of such an eventuality
was highlighted. This article poses the possibility of quarantine of all
passengers to prevent potential spread if smallpox is the etiology. In the
not-so-distant past, quarantine was not felt to be a practical option,
especially for vaccine-preventable diseases. Given the high level of
susceptibility of the general population to smallpox now, in the
post-vaccination era, and given the high mobility of individuals,
revisiting quarantine as an option is not far-fetched. The incubation
period for smallpox ranges from 7-19 days; if a case is confirmed on an
airline flight, logistics for the quarantine of all passengers for an
average of 21 days will have to be developed. Not a simple scenario.
The CDC website has interim response plans for isolation and quarantine
measures in the event of re-introduction of smallpox. These are draft
documents and can be viewed by following the links on:
<http://www.bt.cdc.gov/DocumentsApp/Smallpox/RPG/index.asp>
According to Chin's Control of Communicable Diseases Manual (17th edition,
2000), the definition of quarantine is: "Restriction of the activities of
WELL persons or animals who have been exposed to a case of communicable
disease during its period of communicability (i.e., contacts) to prevent
disease transmission during the incubation period if infection should
occur. Absolute or complete quarantine: The limitation of freedom of
movement of those exposed to a communicable disease for a period of time
not longer than the longest usual incubation period of that disease, in
such manner as to prevent effective contact with those not so exposed." In
contrast, isolation refers to: "separation, for the period of
communicability, of INFECTED persons or animals from others in such places
and under such conditions as to prevent or limit the direct or indirect
transmission of the infectious agent from those infected to those who are
susceptible to infection or who may spread the agent to others." - Mod. MPP]
