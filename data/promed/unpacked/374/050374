Re: H5N6 Highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus: Republic of Korea

The Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency of the Republic of Korea and the OIE/FAO/EU International Reference Laboratory at APHA-Weybridge, UK have characterized a novel emerging highly pathogenic avian influenza A(HPAI) (H5N6) virus isolated from both wild birds and domestic poultry in the Republic of Korea. There was one case of H5N6 HPAI in a broiler duck farm in Jeonbuk province. In addition, one H5N6 virus was isolated from wild birds on Jeju Island. Phylogenetic analyses of a representative of these viruses showed that it was different from previously circulating Korean H5N6 viruses in the 2016-2017 winter season. All genes except the neuraminidase were of the "European H5N8 HPAI lineage" that emerged last winter and continues to be detected in some European countries.

The neuraminidase N6 is most similar to the H5N6 reassortant virus isolated from chickens in Greece in late 2016, which had acquired a neuraminidase gene from the Eurasian low pathogenic avian influenza A virus lineage circulating in wild birds. Although the Greek strain is genetically the closest relative, it has been noted that there are genetic changes between these strains and one H5N6 variant cannot therefore determine risk for the whole lineage. Indeed, the Korean isolate has 2 mutations which might confer altered susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors.

These analyses demonstrate continued circulation of this H5 lineage in multiple geographic regions and likely wild-bird mediated spread.

Although from the sequence analyses, this virus does not currently pose a zoonotic risk, heightened vigilance should be maintained globally for potential spread from wild birds to poultry. The results also demonstrate the complex genetic evolution of these H5 clade 2.3.4.4. viruses that will likely confer different phenotypic properties in a range of hosts, potentially including humans.

[We are very grateful to the source who provided the above information.

The leading role of migrating birds and their contacts with poultry, in the creation and dissemination of new avian influenza reassortants - including zoonotic ones - becomes steadily clearer and recognisable. See also discussion in 20170918.5324107. The most recent European country in which a new reassortant of HPAI H5N6 virus (of the European H5N8 lineage) has been detected, is the Netherlands.

China is, so far, the only country in which human infections by HPAI H5N6 have been recorded. From 2014 to 7 Dec 2017, 17 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported to the WHO by China's mainland health authorities, including 6 deaths. - Mod.AS]
