An anthrax outbreak has aggravated a looming food crisis in eastern
Ethiopia, agriculture officials told IRIN on Monday. Some 11 cases have
been confirmed in Fentale - in the East Shewa area of Oromiya Region -
which, according to the UN Emergencies Unit for Ethiopia (EUE), is one of
the areas most affected by drought.
The district head of the agriculture ministry in Fentale, Biruk Wolkeba,
says thousands of cattle have been immunized to prevent the bacteria
spreading. "Anthrax is a problem during droughts," said Biruk. "It means we
have to be extra careful and check the animals." Biruk said the outbreak
occurred 2 months ago and that 17 530 cattle were immunized. But he warned
that further cases of anthrax were suspected. "If the cattle are weak from
drought, which these animals are, then this will only make the situation
worse," he told IRIN. "The community knows the signs of anthrax very well
and will alert us."
The current anthrax cases were discovered in 2 of the 18 peasant
associations (PAs) that make up Fentale. The 2 PAs where the bacteria were
found -- Benti and Kobo -- border the Awash National Park. Biruk said that
wild animals in the park, such as warthogs, are often infected with the
bacteria.
"Anthrax is common in Ethiopia," he added. It can be treated and prevented
from spreading as long as you catch it early."
The anthrax outbreak comes as the EUE warned that a food crisis is looming
in parts of Ethiopia. It said that the Afar Region, Fentale district in
East Shewa and neighbouring zones of Oromiya Region were most affected.

[If they have their cattle immunized it should not get out of control. But
as Biruk Wolkeba states, malnutrition can significantly impact resistance
and sometimes result in cases in vaccinated stock. The African wildlife
national parks, while they bring in foreign eco-tourists with their money,
are often reservoirs for this disease. Livestock neighboring the park
boundaries are at risk for a number of diseases which may be well
controlled elsewhere in the country. If the boundaries are more notional
than real, i.e., the fencing is weak, livestock are sometimes grazed inside
the park, which increases the risks further. So far it looks as though the
agricultural ministry is on top of the problem. - Mod.MHJ]
