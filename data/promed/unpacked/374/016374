Queensland and northern New South Wales growers need to be vigilant for
stripe rust detection in grain crops following July's cool, wet climatic
conditions. Queensland Department of Primary Industries (DPI&F) officers
are issuing the alert after stripe rust infestations have been reported
from central and southern NSW, and more recently at northern centres of
Moree and Walgett.

DPI&F wheat industry development officer, Ann-Maree Bach, says the NSW rust
infestations have an important bearing on disease management for northern
growers. "Early stripe rust detection should raise industry-wide concern
and growers may need to plan for control strategies," she said. "Stripe
rust infections as early as this could lead to serious economic losses."

Ms Bach said recent weather is providing optimum conditions for stripe rust
infection, and growers need to be aware of the potential threat that it may
pose on their properties. "It is critical this season [2008] that growers
in Queensland begin monitoring for stripe rust and other foliar disease,
such as yellow spot, before growth stage 30 to allow enough time to protect
the plant before damage is done to the flag leaf," she said.

Ms Bach said the earlier the infection the more damage the disease could
cause. "The most damage is caused when the flag leaf and the 2 leaves below
(the primary factories for yield and quality of the wheat plant) are
infected," she said. "If stripe rust is present, fungicide management may
be required on properties that have wheat varieties with stripe rust
ratings less than "Moderately Resistant (MR)."

[Wheat stripe rust (also called yellow rust) is caused by the fungus
_Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_ and occurs worldwide mostly in
cooler climates. It causes yellow leaf stripes, stunting of plants, and
reduced grain number and size on developing heads. Yield losses may vary
from 40 up to 100 per cent. It affects wheat, some barley varieties,
triticale (wheat/rye hybrids), and a number of grass species. Spores are
wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. The fungus
needs living plants to survive between seasons, it cannot survive on seed,
stubble, or in soil. Volunteer plants may generate a "green bridge"
providing inoculum to infect new crops.

Disease management strategies include the use of resistant varieties,
fungicide applications and control of volunteer wheat plants. Since the
fungus interferes with seed development, infection early in the crop cycle
is more damaging than infection after seed fill has concluded. Early
discovery of infection at any stage of the crop cycle is important so
action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up
of inoculum.

The Australian Cereal Rust Control Program monitors the occurrence of
cereal rust pathotypes each year and in 2003, for example, 6 pathotypes of
stripe rust were identified throughout Australia. New strains are emerging
worldwide (see previous ProMED-mail posts below) which may overcome major
stripe rust resistance genes used in wheat breeding and potentially pose
serious problems to farmers.

Yellow spot (also called tan spot) is caused by the fungus _Pyrenophora
tritici-repentis_. It survives in wheat and occasionally triticale stubble.
Severe yellow spot may result in short, spindly plants with reduced
tillering and root development. Where conditions are favourable, plants may
be fully defoliated soon after flowering.
