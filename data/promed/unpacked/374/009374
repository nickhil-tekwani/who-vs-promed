As a veterinarian licensed in Oregon, I received this notice from the Oregon State Public Health Veterinarian:

Canine Influenza virus (CIV): 3 transferred dogs test positive at the Oregon Humane Society.

On Thu 20 Jun 2019, the Oregon Humane Society reported 3 dogs tested positive for H3N2 canine influenza. These dogs were part of a larger 2nd chance transfer from a shelter in Oakland, CA, and no one was aware of infected dogs until after the transfer took place. Testing was done by University of Wisconsin; further genetic mapping will be conducted by Cornell University. These dogs had not yet been in contact with any other shelter dogs and were further quarantined once notified of exposure to positive dogs. The group of dogs are now at an off-site facility for further quarantine and continued treatment.

The Oakland, CA animal shelter has reported an outbreak of canine flu among their dogs. Soon after the positive results were available, the Oakland shelter warned dog owners to steer clear of their facility. "55 of the shelter dogs have contracted CIV, but since it is a contagious disease, all of them are probably affected even if they are not showing signs yet.

Dogs at-risk include but are not limited to those visiting dog parks, dog-daycare, dog shows, grooming, boarding, travel (car, air, etc.), and rescue animals. Dogs with pre-existing heart disease or lung disease, senior dogs, and brachycephalic breeds are also at a significant risk.

These at-risk dogs should be vaccinated with an initial 2-dose series of a bivalent vaccine, 2-4 weeks apart. Full adaptive immune response does not occur until 7-10 days after the 2nd vaccine. Boosters should be given annually. In cases where dogs have not received their boosters within 18 months of their last influenza vaccine, the initial 2-dose series should be repeated. CIV vaccine reduces clinical signs severity, degree of infection, illness, and viral shedding of infected dogs.

If your patient is at risk of contracting kennel cough (_Bordetella sp_, parainfluenza, or others), it is recommended your patients also be protected against canine influenza.

Canine influenza is a voluntarily reportable disease in Oregon. Reporting confirmed cases helps us better understand the spread of this virus.

[Per a source known to ProMED, there are also additional cases of H3N2 canine influenza that have recently been identified in San Francisco, San Jose, Santa Cruz, Mountain View, CA, and Portland, OR as well. It's unclear whether the other California cases are also related to the cases from the Oakland, CA shelter.
