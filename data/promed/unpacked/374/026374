Mango growers of Krishnagiri district are protesting by bringing samples of infected mango flowers to the Horticulture Department, as a fungal infection is ravaging their annual crop. This is the 3rd consecutive year of infection. Due to good rainfall, mangos had flowered well. But they are now slowly being destroyed by a fungal disease, according to a local association of mango growers. They expect less than 10% of production in 2022 due to the disease.

The famers want guidance and advice from the Horticulture Department on how to prevent infection. Currently, giving advice is left to private fertiliser dealers. The growers underline the need for guidance from the department and also demand compensation for crop loss.

[Mango (_Mangifera indica_) is one of the most important fruits worldwide. A number of fungal and some bacterial diseases affecting the crop have been reported in the region, including anthracnose, mildews, leaf and stem blights, diebacks, and root rots. Many of these pathogens are favoured by humidity. Furthermore, wounds due to insects, weather, or other mechanical damage may provide easy entrance points for infection.

Anthracnose, which is considered the most important disease of mango, is present in India and the region (e.g., ProMED post 20210708.8502890). It is caused by fungi in the genus _Colletotrichum_ and is favoured by humid conditions during early flowering. Besides leaf, fruit, and twig symptoms (see previous ProMED posts in the archives and links below), infection may lead to blight and necrosis of flowers, which can be completely destroyed. While this may be the disease referred to above, reliable diagnosis of any pathogen(s) involved in the reported problems is needed to be able to design appropriate management strategies for local conditions.
