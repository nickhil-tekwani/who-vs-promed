This year's [2008] 1st P1 [poliovirus type 1] wild polio virus strain
[WPV1] has been isolated in Delhi. [A 14-month-old girl] from
Darbangia colony in Kirti Nagar area is the victim.

The daughter of a rickshaw-puller, the girl's family migrated from
Bihar just 6 months ago. She was supposedly administered 10 doses of
oral polio vaccine [this is highly unlikely - Mod.MPP] in the last 2
national immunization rounds in January and February this year [2008].

Till now this year [2008], 106 polio cases have been isolated in
India, but all of them have been P3 [poliovirus type 3] strains. This
is the 1st P1 polio case in Delhi after August 2006.

P1 has been India's major enemy, with the global advisory committee
on polio giving top priority to its eradication. The Union health
ministry successfully contained its spread in 2007 with just 36 cases.

For the 1st time since 1999, the number of P3 cases had outnumbered
the number of infections caused by the P1 strain. P1 travels faster
and infects more children, which is why the emphasis was placed on
eradicating type 1 1st.

P3 is a very slow moving virus with low virulence.

P1 causes paralysis in one out of every 200 children as compared to
P3, which causes paralysis in one out of every 1000 infections.

Health ministry sources told TOI that a polio vaccination round is
scheduled to take place in Delhi this month [March 2008]. But states
can undertake an emergency mop-up operation whenever a P1 strain
crops up.

Polio has been crippling India, with 864 cases in 2007 compared to
676 cases in 2006. This made finance minister P Chidambaram allocate
Rs 1042 crore [USD 258 million] just for polio in the Union Budget
for 2008-09, most of which will be spent to contain the virus in
Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.

Bihar, which reported 193 fresh cases of the crippling disease in
2007, has been exporting polio strains across India. An alarmed
health ministry has now marked 72 blocks in Bihar as high risk. These
blocks or the ones adjacent to them accounted for 3/4ths of the total
polio cases in the state in the past 5 years. In 2007, 90 percent of
P1 cases were found in these blocks.

According to experts, polio immunisation activities are being
intensified in these blocks. A special immunization drive was
conducted on 13 Jan 2007 in these 72 blocks.

A ministry official told TOI: "We have been trying to contain P1,
which is more virulent, and have met with success. That led to an
increase in incidence of P3 cases. Bihar also saw the worst floods in
the past 30 years in August [2007], which badly hit the immunisation
rounds of August and September [2007]. We have, however, conducted 2
rounds of vaccination against P3 in October and December [2007].
Another round is planned for March [2008]."

"During the last meeting of the Indian Expert Advisory Group on polio
on [19 Dec 2008], several goals were set. Among them was to sustain
immunity against P1 virus all across India. The highest priority of
the programme is to rapidly improve supplementary immunity activity
in high-risk blocks of Bihar to prevent re-infection in polio-free
areas," an official said.

[According to the polioeradication website, as of 26 Feb 2008 there
have been a total of 111 confirmed cases of polio due to wild virus
infection worldwide since the beginning of 2008, compared with a
total of 19 cases confirmed during the same period in 2007. Of these
111 cases, 82 were in India, compared with 7 cases confirmed during
the same period in 2007. The date of the most recent case is 3 Feb
2008, with 23 new cases reported during the week preceding the date
of report (26 Feb 2008), suggesting there is an upsurge in polio
activity in India. According to that update, no cases of wild
poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) have been reported for 2008 as yet (see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp>).
The date of onset of the most recent case of WPV1 infection is listed
as 31 Dec 2008, so it has not been that long a period of WPV1-free
status in the country (see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casecount.pdf>.)
The mention that it is the 1st WPV1 case identified in Delhi since
August 2006 has one speculating, since the case's family is from
Bihar, that they are probably living in an area with other more
recent migrants from Bihar, where WPV1 is known to still be
circulating.

As a reminder, in recent years, the polio eradication effort has
switched to the use of monovalent oral poliovirus vaccine (mOPV)
using the vaccine virus type 1 to interrupt transmission of the then
predominant WPV1 circulation in the country. The resurgence of WPV3
as a predominant type in circulation serves to validate that the
widespread use of mOPV1 was successful in interrupting transmission
of WPV1 in most of the country. The clear challenge ahead will be the
interruption of WPV3 circulation without jeopardizing the
interruption of WPV1 circulation.
