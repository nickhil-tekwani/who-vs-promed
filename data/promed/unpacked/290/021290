Whooping cough [pertussis], a highly contagious infectious disease that can be prevented with vaccination in children, resurfaced in Bogota and this year [2012] has already caused the deaths of 23 children younger than 5 years. The District Department of Health [SDS by its Spanish initials] confirmed that this number almost doubles the 14 fatal cases recorded in 2011. Most of the victims were younger than one year, according to SDS epidemiologist Patricia Arce.

The National Institute of Health [INS by its Spanish initials] in turn reported that between January and September 2012, 589 cases of pertussis were confirmed in Bogota, 21 percent of all cases diagnosed in the country. Bogota is 2nd to Antioquia, with the most confirmed cases, mostly in children under 5 years.

The concern of health authorities is that pertussis is easily transmitted by saliva droplets when you cough or sneeze.

In Bogota, most sick children were infected by their parents. "Newborns are most susceptible to infection because their immune system still does not have enough defenses against disease," explained Arce.

Some health experts questioned the reemergence of pertussis, since a vaccine has been available for 50 years, and there are teams in the city which supposedly visit households to identify children requiring completion of their vaccination schedule. [But many were in children who were too young to be vaccinated. - Mod.JW].

Pertussis is caused by the bacterium _Bordetella pertussis_. It is transmitted by the respiratory route, has an incubation period of 6 to 20 days, and can last an average of 7 weeks or more. It begins with a catarrhal phase, and its characteristic symptom is persistent cough or wheezing with noise, which makes breathing difficult. In children, it can lead to breathing difficulties that last [for several] seconds, making them turn blue or purple and requiring urgent care.

[2012 has been a dramatic year for pertussis throughout most of the world. Although there is some evidence for genetic changes in the strains, it is clear that the less reactogenic acellular pertussis vaccine has a shorter length of protection than the older whole cell, killed vaccine.

As is reported in this posting, much of the morbidity and mortality with this infection is in infants less than one year of age, especially less than 6 months, when they are not yet protected by active immunization. To protect this susceptible cohort, all care givers should have been given a TDap booster, and the pregnant mother should also be immunized in the 2nd or 3rd trimester to transplacentally provide maternal antibody. - Mod.LL
