MALARIA - HAITI, CANADA EX HAITI (02): COTES DES ARCADINS

The first 2 patients mentioned in the 8 Nov 2005 posting have been shown to
have _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria, as proven by blood smears examined in
Canada (patient 1, parasitemia up to 9.5 per cent) and in Haiti and the
Unites States (patient 2, low parasitemia, between 0.002 and 0.4 per cent,
probably due to previous treatment).
The fatal illnesses in these 2 patients were striking by the severity of
their clinical presentation (multiorgan failure, hypotension, cyanosis of
extremities, disseminated intravascular coagulation/DIC), but were entirely
compatible with severe malaria. Potential contribution by other pathologies
(such as dengue and leptospirosis) is currently being investigated in
laboratories in Haiti, Canada, and the US.
The Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP) of Haiti is currently
conducting epidemiologic investigations in Port-au-Prince and in Cotes des
Arcadins, the beach area visited by these 2 patients approximately 2 weeks
before their first symptoms. In the University Hospital in Port-au-Prince,
of 260 febrile patients seen during the past 4 weeks, 12 (4.6 per cent)
were found to be smear positive for malaria, and at the Canape-Vert
hospital, of 359 specimens examined, 15 (4.2 per cent) were found to be
positive for malaria. These figures are comparable to the slide positivity
rate of 3.0 per cent (all _P. falciparum_) found among 1065 febrile
patients seen during a country-wide survey in June 2005. An ongoing,
non-systematic survey of private physicians in Port-au-Prince detected one
recent death from malaria (5 year old child), and another patient with
cerebral malaria, a 38 year old man who is currently recovering.
In Cotes des Arcadins, the MSPP is conducting active case detection with
presumptive treatment of all febrile patients. During the period 6-9 Nov
2005, 91 persons who had fever or a history of fever were treated;
examination of these patients' blood smears, at the MSPP reference
laboratory, showed that 52 per cent were infected with _P. falciparum_.
This elevated positivity rate suggests an alarmingly high transmission of
malaria in the area of Cotes des Arcadins. Accordingly, the MSPP is
conducting in that area intensive control interventions that include active
surveillance; treatment and follow-up of febrile patients; identification
and treatment/destruction of mosquito breeding sites; and (under
consideration) other vector control and personal protection measures.
None of the patients in Port-au-Prince or Cotes des Arcadins had severe
hemorrhagic manifestations, or other manifestations incompatible with
malaria. While the investigations are still in their early stage, we have
seen no indications that a new disease has emerged in Haiti, but we have
detected an unusually high transmission of _P. falciparum_ in the area of
Cotes des Arcadins. We are actively assessing whether more virulent forms
of _P. falciparum_ malaria might be present, and whether altered drug
sensitivity might play a role. _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria remains an
important public health problem in Haiti, and the MSPP is working actively
with its partners towards improved surveillance and control of the disease.
Visitors to Haiti should take all necessary precautions to avoid acquiring
malaria, including chemoprophylaxis and personal protection against
mosquito bites.

[ProMED-mail thanks Drs Marie Denise Milord and Myrtha Louissaint for
providing a thorough explanation of the previously unexplained deaths in
Haiti, reported by ProMED-mail on 8 Nov 2005. As pointed out in the
message, malaria continues to be a serious problem in Haiti, and travellers
should take necessary precautions including chemoprophylaxis. - Mod.EP]
