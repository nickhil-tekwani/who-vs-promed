Have you considered the effects of toxicants available to kill
nuisance birds available to pest control companies? This looks a lot
like the effects of some of these.

Avitrol is a an avicide commonly used by food plants or buildings
trying to rid themselves of pigeons. Whoever is applying it may be
using too much. Often there are corn bits on roofs in the area. The
birds act like they have been doing drugs, like people on LSD; the
distressed flying patterns send signals to the other pigeons.
However, the other pigeons do not always catch on, and someone may
become impatient and add too much.
In many states you have to get a permit from the conservation
department. If so, they may be able to help identify the source.

[An avicide is a likely possibility. Avitrol is the commercial name
for 4-aminopyridine. It is available as a grain or powder bait in
various concentrations. The baits vary depending upon the species to
be controlled. Grain, corn, and bread have proven effective. Avitrol
is considered an avi-repellent (bird repellent). It does have a
restricted use status. It is EPA-registered for control of crows,
pigeons, grackles, starlings, sparrows, cowbirds, gulls, and
blackbirds in and around structures and agriculture fields. It causes
individual members of a flock of birds to make sounds and signs of
physical distress that act to repel the remainder of the flock.
Avitrol works primarily by producing an adverse effect in birds that
feed upon it. The effects vary, depending on the quantity of Avitrol
consumed, the condition of the birds, and the bird species. They can
be classified as follows: 1) There is no visible or audible
response. The bird leaves the area. This effect occurs at high
bait dilution rates so that the bird ingests only a small amount of
treated bait. Mortality is very low. 2) The bird may utter
distress calls, flap about, fly in an unusual manner, or otherwise
show effects. You can expect some of these birds to die, perhaps up
to 10 percent. 3). The bird shows an intensification of effect
Number 2. The reactions are violent and vigorous, and the bird
eventually becomes incapacitated. A high percentage of these birds
die. This effect is caused by high dosage rates of treated bait or
by birds having low resistance.
Birds affected by Avitrol will usually react within 5-15 minutes and
often continue to "demonstrate" for 30 minutes or longer. "Downed"
birds either die or recover within 1-15 hours .
