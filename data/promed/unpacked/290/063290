Mad Cow Feed Recall, USA, Albertville, AL, 16 Jun 2006; Feed Recalled
Over Mad Cow Violation
-----------------------------------------------
Livestock feed ingredients shipped to 9 states may have been
contaminated with cattle remains in violation of a 1997 ban to
protect against mad cow disease, a manufacturer said Tuesday [20 Jun 2006].
H.J. Baker & Bro. Inc. said it was recalling 3 livestock feed
ingredients, including 2 used to supplement feed given to dairy cows.
A sample tested by the Food and Drug Administration was positive for
cattle meat and bone meal, said Mark Hohnbaum, president of the
Westport, Connecticut-based company's feed products group.
"This is very concerning to us. This isn't something that happens to
us. We are very serious about food safety," Hohnbaum said. Mad cow
disease is only known to spread when cows eat feed containing brain
and other nerve tissue from infected cattle. Protein from cattle was
commonly added to cattle feed to speed growth until the ban largely
outlawed the practice.
Cattle tissue may have contaminated 2 feed ingredients given to dairy
cows -- Pro-Lak and Pro-Amino II -- made by H.J. Baker between August
2005 and June 2006. The 3rd of the recalled ingredients, Pro-Pak with
Porcine Meat and Bone, was mislabeled. It is used in poultry feed.
The company announced the recall in the wake of ongoing FDA
inspections of its Albertville, Alabama plant, Hohnbaum said. The
inspections have found manufacturing and clerical issues, he added.
The company shipped the ingredients to feed manufacturers and dairy
farms in the following states: Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi and Tennessee. The company
is notifying its customers of the voluntary recall. It does not know
how much of the feed ingredients it sold, Hohnbaum said.

[The company is already notifying its customers. Furthermore, the
company does not know how much feed was contaminated, so they are
likely being very cautious and notifying customers, although they may
not have had animals exposed.
It is likely the company does not know how much contamination each
batch of feed received.
Customers should be forewarned that even if an animal consumes some
of this feed, it does not mean it is sure to come down with Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE). It takes a certain amount of
infective material being consumed as well as certain conditions
within the animal for BSE to develop.
What is intriguing about this event is that, though the FDA will fine
the feed manufacturer, on-farm mixing of feed that may contain
prohibited material does not find its way onto the FDA radar screen.
There have been multiple cases of farm-site feed mixing with
confirmation of prohibited material being in the feed, and the feed
being fed to cattle. When this apparent oversight was brought to the
attention of the FDA, the reply was that they [the FDA] did not
believe they had jurisdiction over the farm, only the manufacturers.
Since the FDA could not demonstrate a prion to a court of law, they
did not see how they could prosecute a case of farm-site feed mixing.
Clearly, had the international team that surveyed the situation in
the US during 2004 known of this approach, their recommendations may
well have been different.
Without adherence to the feeding rules, cases of BSE in the United
States will likely continue to occur on a sporadic basis. - Mod.TG]
