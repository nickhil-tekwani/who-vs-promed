A horse property in southwest Kansas is under quarantine following confirmation of 6 cases of equine infectious anemia in horses. The infected horses on the property in Finney County will be euthanized because there is no cure and there is a risk the animals may infect other horses.

The Kansas Department of Agriculture's Division of Animal Health was told this month [August 2017] of the initial positive test for the disease, also known as Swamp fever. The horse facility was quarantined and all the exposed horses were tested, with 5 additional positive cases detected. The remaining horses at the facility will be observed and retested in 60 days.

Equine infectious anemia is most commonly spread by biting flies and ticks, or sometimes through the shared used of blood-contaminated instruments or needles. The disease does not affect people, but it can be spread to horses, mules and donkeys.

The virus attacks the immune system, with signs including bleeding in mucus membranes and a gradual loss of condition and muscle weakness. Other signs include fever, depression and anemia. Infected horses can run a low-grade fever or become lethargic, but often there are no clinical signs. Infected horses continue to carry the virus and can be the source of further infections, hence the protocol to euthanize infected animals.

All infected horses, including those who have no signs, are carriers of the disease. There is no vaccine or treatment.

There are typically a small number of cases in the United States every year, although the disease is common in other parts of the world. The disease is controlled in the US by regular testing before horses are allowed to travel across state lines and/or to shows.

The pathogen causing the disease is categorized as a lentivirus: it contains genetic RNA material, which it uses to produce DNA. This DNA is then incorporated into the genetic makeup of infected cells.

The disease was first identified in France in 1843 and first tentatively diagnosed in the United States in 1888.

[This seems like a lot of animals to euthanize from one facility and surely horse owners and the facility managers are immensely affected.

How sad that this disease continues and there is no vaccine for it. We pour millions into other research projects, some of which seem to have little usefulness, but why no vaccine?

"Under natural conditions, the most important mode of transmission of equine infectious anemia (EIA) is by the transfer of virus-infective blood by blood-feeding insects between horses in close proximity. Virus is found free in the plasma or cell associated, principally in monocytes and macrophages of infected animals. Although infection is considered primarily blood borne, all tissues and body fluids are potentially infectious, especially during episodes of clinical disease when viral burdens are high. Transmission of EIA by biting flies is purely mechanical; the virus does not replicate in the vector. The chance of transmission of EIA is directly proportional to the volume of blood retained on the mouthparts of the insect after feeding. In that respect, horse flies, deer flies, and to a lesser extent, stable flies are likely the most efficient vectors. It is also because they are capable of triggering host defensive behavior that interrupts feeding and results in their seeking a new susceptible host to complete their blood meal."

Fly control is very important, in the barn and on the animal.

Currently there is no vaccine for EIA in the US. There is a vaccine developed in China and used in other places (see: Equine infectious anemia - USA (04): (KY) unlicensed vaccine 20150915.3645562).
