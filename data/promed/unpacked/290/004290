According to the press service for Rospotrebnadzor (federal agency for protection of consumer rights and human wellbeing), 36 persons have contracted CCHF in the Stavropol region. In 58 per cent of cases patients contracted infection via tick bites while caring for animals and other agricultural work.

As of 15 Jul [2015], more than 7600 humans have sought medical aid after tick bites this year. This is 50 per cent more than for the same period last year [2014] when 276 persons were hospitalized with suspicion of CCHF.

So far 6363 hectares [15 723 acres] have been treated against ticks including resort areas, summer camps, and pastures.

[CCHF is endemic and occurs frequently in the Stavropol region. ProMED-mail reports multiple cases nearly every year (see archives listed below). The number of CCHF cases has increased from 29 on 30 Jun 2015 to 36 so far this year. Increased risk of CCHF virus infection in southern Russia is attributed to high humidity and warm weather, which favor tick abundance (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150709.3498303).
