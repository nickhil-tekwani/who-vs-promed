Former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter were poisoned by a military-grade nerve agent of a type developed by Russia, Theresa May has told MPs.

The PM (Prime Minister) said it was "highly likely" Russia was responsible for the Salisbury attack.

The Foreign Office summoned Russia's ambassador to provide an explanation.

Mrs. May said that if there is no "credible response" by the end of Tuesday [13 Mar 2018], the UK would conclude there has been an "unlawful use of force" by Moscow.

The chemical used in the attack, the PM said, has been identified as one of a group of nerve agents known as Novichok.

Mrs. May said: "Either this was a direct action by the Russian state against our country, or the Russian government lost control of its potentially catastrophically damaging nerve agent and allowed it to get into the hands of others."

She said Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson had told the ambassador Moscow must provide "full and complete disclosure" of the Novichok programme to the international body of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).

Mrs. May said the UK must stand ready to take much more extensive measures, and these would be set out in the Commons on Wednesday [14 Mar 2018] should there be no adequate explanation from Russia.

Retired military intelligence officer Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter, Yulia, 33, were found slumped on a bench in Salisbury city centre on Sun 4 Mar 2018. They remain in a critical but stable condition in hospital.

Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who fell ill attending the pair, remains seriously ill, but has been talking to his family.

Mr Skripal was convicted by the Russian government of passing secrets to MI6 in 2004 but was given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a "spy swap."

Home Secretary Amber Rudd will chair a meeting of the government emergency committee Cobra on Tuesday [13 Mar 2018] to discuss the latest developments in the case.

What are Novichok agents? The name means "newcomer" in Russian, and applies to a group of advanced nerve agents developed in secret by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s.

One chemical -- called A-230 -- is reportedly 5 to 8 times more toxic than VX nerve agent, which can kill a person within minutes [This may be Novichok A-230. - Mod.TG].

Some are liquids, others are thought to exist in solid form. Some are reported to be "binary weapons," meaning they are typically stored as 2 less toxic chemicals, which, when mixed, react to produce the more toxic agent. One variant was reportedly approved for use by the Russian military as a chemical weapon.

Designed to escape detection by international inspectors, their existence was revealed by defectors.

Addressing the Commons following a meeting of the government's National Security Council, Mrs. May said: "This attempted murder using a weapons-grade nerve agent in a British town was not just a crime against the Skripals. It was an indiscriminate and reckless act against the United Kingdom, putting the lives of innocent civilians at risk."

She told MPs the positive identification of this chemical agent was made by experts at the UK's Porton Down laboratory. She said Russia has previously produced the agent and would still be capable of doing so.

The decision to point the finger at Moscow was also based on "Russia's record of conducting state-sponsored assassinations and our assessment that Russia views some defectors as legitimate targets for assassinations," the PM added.

A former Russian spy and his daughter were poisoned by a chemical that is part of a group of nerve agents known as Novichok, UK Prime Minister Theresa May has said.

Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia remain critically ill after the attempted murder in Salisbury on 4 Mar 2018.

The chemical was identified by experts at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) at Porton Down.

What do we know about this group of military-grade nerve agents?

They were developed in the Soviet Union.

The name Novichok means "newcomer" in Russian and applies to a group of advanced nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s.

They were known as 4th-generation chemical weapons and were developed under a Soviet programme codenamed "Foliant."

In 1999, defence officials from the US travelled to Uzbekistan to help dismantle and decontaminate one of the former Soviet Union's largest chemical weapons testing facilities.

According to a senior defector, the Soviets used the plant to produce and test small batches of Novichok. These nerve agents were designed to escape detection by international inspectors.

They are more toxic than other agents. One of the group of chemicals known as Novichoks -- A-230 -- is reportedly 5-8 times more toxic than VX nerve agent.

"This is a more dangerous and sophisticated agent than sarin or VX and is harder to identify," says Professor Gary Stephens, a pharmacology expert at the University of Reading.

VX agent was the chemical used to kill the half-brother of Kim Jong-un last year [2017], according to the US.

A number of variants of A-230 have been manufactured. One of these experimental chemicals -- A-232 -- was reportedly used by the Russian military as the basis for a chemical weapon, known as Novichok-5.

"One of the main reasons these agents are developed is because their component parts are not on the banned list," says Professor Stephens. "It means the chemicals that are mixed to create it are much easier to deliver, with no risk to the health of the courier."

Some can take effect very quickly. The Novichoks were designed to be more toxic than other chemical weapons, so some versions would begin to take effect rapidly, on the order of 30 seconds to 2 minutes.

The main route of exposure is likely to be through inhalation, though they could also be absorbed through the skin. However, in powder form, an agent might take longer to act.

The symptoms are similar to those of other nerve agents. It is thought Novichok agents have similar effects to other nerve agents. This means they act by blocking the messages from the nerves to the muscles, causing a collapse of many bodily functions. Symptoms include white eyes, as the pupils become constricted, convulsions, drooling, and, in the worst cases, coma, respiratory failure and death. These agents primarily cause a slowing of the heart and restriction of the airways, leading to death by asphyxiation.

Some Novichok variants have been specifically designed to resist standard nerve agent antidotes.

If a person is exposed to it, their clothing should be removed and their skin washed with soap and water. Their eyes should be rinsed, and they should be given oxygen.

[Nerve agents are a class of chemicals designed to block the mechanisms by which nerves transfer messages. The disruption is caused by the blocking of acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme catalyzing the breakdown of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter is blocked. The acetylcholine builds up, causing the nerve to continue to fire, thus, constant stimulation of a muscle or organ.

Among lethal CW agents, the nerve agents have had an entirely dominant role since the Second World War. Nerve agents acquired their name because they affect the transmission of nerve impulses in the nervous system. All nerve agents belong chemically to the group of organo-phosphorus compounds. They are stable and easily dispersed, highly toxic and have rapid effects both when absorbed through the skin and via respiration. Nerve agents can be manufactured by means of fairly simple chemical techniques. The raw materials are inexpensive and generally readily available.

It was not until the early 1930's that German chemists observed that organo-phosphorus compounds could be poisonous. In 1934, Dr Gerhard Schrader, a chemist at IG Farben, was given the task of developing a pesticide. Two years later a phosphorus compound with extremely high toxicity was produced for the 1st time. According to contemporary regulations, discoveries with implications had to be reported to the concerned authorities, which was also done with Schrader's discovery. This phosphorus compound, given the name tabun, was the 1st of the substances later referred to as nerve agents.

A factory for production of the new CW agent was built and a total of 12 000 tonnes of tabun were produced during the years 1942-1945.

At the end of the war the Allies seized large quantities of this nerve agent. Up to the end of the war, Schrader and his co-workers synthesized about 2000 new organo-phosphorus compounds, including sarin (1938). The 3rd of the "classic" nerve agents, soman, was 1st produced in 1944. These 3 nerve agents are known as G agents in the American nomenclature. The manufacture of sarin never started properly, and up to 1945, only about 0.5 tonne of this nerve agent was produced in a pilot plant.

Immediately after the war, research was mainly concentrated on studies of the mechanisms of the nerve agents in order to discover more effective forms of protection against these new CW agents. The results of these efforts led, however, not only to better forms of protection but also to new types of agents closely related to the earlier ones.

By the mid-1950's a group of more stable nerve agents had been developed, known as the V-agents in the American nomenclature. They are approximately 10-fold more poisonous than sarin and are thus among the most toxic substances ever synthesized. Until now. The Novichok variants are believed to be much more toxic than the V-agents.

Most chemical ammunition can be described as unitary, which implies that it contains one active ready-to-use CW agent. Binary technology implies that the final stage in the synthesis of the nerve agent is moved from the factory into the warhead, which thus functions as a chemical reactor. Two initial substances which are stored in separate containers are mixed and allowed to react and form the nerve agent when the ammunition (bomb, projectile, grenade, etc.) is on its way towards the target.

Until the actual moment of use, the ammunition contains only relatively non-toxic initial substances. It is, therefore, considered to be safer to manufacture, store, transport and, finally, destroy. However, some critics question whether this practically untested type of new ammunition is reliable. The technique for mixing substances in bombs and rockets is complicated and requires space. The reaction has to be controlled (e.g., the temperature) and the process should preferably take place without solvents.

In 1991 Iraq declared to the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) a different binary munitions concept. According to this, the munitions were stored containing one component. Shortly before use, the munitions were opened, and the 2nd component was added. Thus, the reaction began even before the munitions were launched.

Binary components for the 3 most common nerve agents (are the following:
- Sarin: methylphosphoryldifluoride + isopropanol. The isopropanol is included in a mixture with isopropylamine which binds the hydrogen fluoride generated.
- Soman): methylphosphoryldifluorid + pinacolylalcohol.
- VX-2: O-ethyl O-2-diisopropylaminoethyl methylphosphonite + sulphur.

When exposed to a low dose of nerve agent, causing minor poisoning, characteristic symptoms are increased production of saliva, a running nose and a feeling of pressure on the chest. The pupil of the eye becomes contracted (miosis) which impairs night-vision. The accommodation capacity of the eye is also reduced so that short-range vision deteriorates, and the victim feels pain when he tries to focus on an object nearby. This is accompanied by headache. More unspecific symptoms are tiredness, slurred speech, hallucinations and nausea.

Exposure to a higher dose leads to a more dramatic development and symptoms are more pronounced. Bronchoconstriction and secretion of mucous in the respiratory system leads to difficulty in breathing and to coughing. Discomfort in the gastrointestinal tract may develop into cramp and vomiting. Involuntary discharge of urine and defecation may also form part of the picture. The discharge of saliva is powerful, and the victim may experience running eyes and sweating. Symptoms from the skeletal muscles are very typical. If the poisoning is moderate, this may express itself as muscular weakness, local tremors or convulsions.

When exposed to a high dose of nerve agent, the muscular symptoms are more pronounced. The victim may suffer convulsions and lose consciousness. To some extent, the poisoning process may be so rapid that earlier mentioned symptoms may never have time to develop.

Muscular paralysis caused by nerve agents also affects the respiratory muscles. Nerve agents also affect the respiratory centre of the central nervous system. The combination of these two effects is the direct cause of death. Consequently, death caused by nerve agents is a kind of death by suffocation.

However, the Novichok agents seem to affect the victim much more quickly than any of the previous mentioned agents.

Atropine. and an oxime which directly reacts with the cause of the injury, i.e., nerve agent-inhibited acetylcholinesterase. The oximes functions as a reactivator which restores the enzyme to an operational condition. Oximes have a poor penetration capacity into the brain and thus mainly work in the peripheral nervous system.
