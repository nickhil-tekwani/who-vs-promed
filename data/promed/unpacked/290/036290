An avian flu epidemic has erupted in northern Italy, prompting a
mass slaughter of more than two million birds.
"The illness, which broke out last month, mainly affects turkeys,''
said Giovanni Ballarini, director of the veterinary department of the
University of Parma.
He said poultry breeders were forced to slaughter the birds and
disinfect their habitats as it was not viable to vaccinate them due to
their short lifespan.
Rita Pasquarelli, director of the National Poultry Union,
representing the poultry industry, said almost 2 million birds had
died or been slaughtered in Lombardia province and about 300 000
had died or been slaughtered in Veneto. "There are about 37
affected areas in Lombardia, some 21 in Veneto, one in Sardinia
and one in Friuli-Venezia Giulia,'' she said.
She said the sanitary authorities were taking all the necessary
steps to tackle the epidemic. "All the birds have to be slaughtered. It
is the only way to deal with the problem,'' she added. She said
authorities would have a clearer idea in 2 to 3 weeks of whether or
not they were stamping out the illness.
