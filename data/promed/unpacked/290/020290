As the entire health machinery is engaged in containing the dreadful Nipah virus, monsoon related fever has begun to rise. Japan encephalitis (JE), malaria and dengue have started reporting and JE has already claimed a life. Of the 3 JE cases reported An Azhiyoor native (age 62) died on [30 May 2018].

"Japanese encephalitis is a mosquitoborne viral infection developing the symptoms of fever, headache and seizures causing inflammation to the brain; people should be cautious against this," said district medical officer Dr V Jayashree. A team from the Entomology Zonal Office in Thiruvananthapuram had visited Azhiyoor after the JE death.

Mavoor gram panchayat had organised a one-day house visit at its 18 wards educating people to destroy the mosquito breeding spots through squad works.

[The number of JE cases in Kerala state has increased by one in the past week, with one death. The JE virus transmission season has begun in India. Although a vaccine is available, there is no indication that the 3 patients had been vaccinated or whether a vaccination campaign is planned. Because vector control is difficult and expensive, vaccination is a more effective preventive measure.

Frequently, in reports of JE cases in India, acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) of undefined etiology is often mentioned with JE cases, a minority of those hospitalized. In the above 2 cases, AES is not mentioned nor is there an indication that their JE virus etiology was laboratory confirmed.
