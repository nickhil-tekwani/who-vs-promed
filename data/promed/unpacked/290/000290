Bluetongue restrictions lifted from 5 Jul 2011
----------------------------------------------
Great Britain will be officially reclassified as bluetongue [BTV]
free from 5 Jul 2011, after 2 years without a case of the disease.

The move means that restrictions on exporting sheep and cattle from
Great Britain will be lifted.

Bluetongue free status will mean that animals exported from Great
Britain to bluetongue free countries, mainly the Republic of Ireland,
won't require vaccination, or need to meet any other bluetongue
requirements.

However, it also means farmers will not be allowed to vaccinate their
stock against the disease after 5 Jul 2011.

Farm minister Jim Mr Paice said: "This is great news for farmers --
and it's an achievement by farmers too. This is the result of a strong
and successful partnership between government, farmers, and vets to
eradicate this serious disease.

"There have been no new cases of bluetongue in Britain for 2 years,
but farmers and vets need to remain vigilant and continue to be
careful of animals they import."

It had been hoped that Great Britain could move to BTV free status
but still retain the option to vaccinate were the disease risk status
to change. But under EU law, once a country is declared bluetongue
free, livestock keepers are no longer able to vaccinate.

The government has said it is pressing for changes to be made at
European level to allow farmers to use vaccination even when
bluetongue zones are not in place.

A testing system will be maintained for animals imported into the
country from high-risk countries.

[The mentioned desire to allow continued vaccination in spite of
being declared BTV free, should be understood in view of GB's wish to
facilitate exports to BTV infected EU countries, where -- albeit
theoretically -- susceptible ruminants are potentially exposed to
infection. - Mod.AS]

Abstract
--------
Following a request from the Commission, the Panel on Animal Health
and Welfare was asked to deliver a Scientific Opinion on:
1) the expected prevalence (design prevalence) under different
circumstances, and,
2) an updated scientific assessment of the size of the relevant
geographical area for the purpose of monitoring and surveillance
programmes for bluetongue.

A systematic literature review and a review of monitoring and
surveillance data from European Union Member States was performed in
order to estimate the prevalences observed in the Member States. The
prevalences observed in areas that have been infected for several
years were slightly lower than the design prevalence of 2 percent
currently used for monthly testing of sentinel animals, but much lower
than the design prevalences of 20 percent and 10 percent for annual
surveys in populations of unvaccinated and vaccinated ruminants,
respectively. Currently there is no scientific evidence that suggests
an optimal size of the relevant geographic unit for BTV monitoring and
surveillance, since it depends on many factors, including the goal of
the surveillance programmes. Early warning based on passive
surveillance will take place irrespective of the size of the
geographical unit but, when based on active surveillance, it is best
targeted at regions considered at risk for introduction, using small
geographical units, a high sampling frequency and sample size.

For estimating the impact of interventions on the prevalence of
infected animals, smaller areas result in more precise estimates of
the prevalence and also take better account of local differences. For
establishing freedom from infection, smaller areas result in lower
design prevalence for a region as a whole and take better account of
local differences in infection dynamics.

BTV-8 invaded northern Europe (Netherlands, Belgium, Germany) in fall
2006, spreading southwards in 2007; during 2007-2008, 5-digit number
of cases, particularly in cattle, were recorded, with France being the
most severely affected country. BTV-1 was later diagnosed as well,
spreading from Spain northwards into France.

A map of Europe showing the restricted zones as of 5 May 2011,
according to the distribution of the various BTV serotypes, is
available at
http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/bt_restrictedzones-map_2011.jpg.


Since 2009, a striking decline in the number of outbreaks was noted;
this is mainly attributed to the control policy adopted by the EU,
namely a combination of mass vaccination with restricted animal
movements throughout Europe. It will be interesting to check if
climatic changes have also had their share in the decline.
