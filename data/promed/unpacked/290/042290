[1] CDC & WHO Press Briefings on EVD
Date: 2 Sep 2014

Today [2 Sep 2014], the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] both held press conferences (unfortunately, at the same time) on the Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa. Both carried similar messages.

The EVD outbreak in West Africa is moving faster than the response currently being mounted against it. A concerted international effort is needed now to defeat this epidemic, with the implied threat that we either deal with it now in Africa, or we risk having to deal with it for years to come around the globe.

CDC director Dr Thomas Frieden painted a grim picture in his update on the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, saying that the epidemic was "spiraling out of control", but stressed there was still a "small window of opportunity" to contain it.

A transcript and audio file should be posted on the CDC Media website, hopefully later today [2 Sep 2014], with links to videos of the WHO/UN briefing.

[2] Nigeria: new case
Date: 2 Sep 2014
Source: Nigerian Eye [abridged, edited]
http://www.nigerianeye.com/2014/09/ebola-update-another-ebola-case-in-port.html


One of 3 people taken to the Ebola virus quarantine centre in Oduoha, Emohua Local Government Area of Rivers State, has tested positive for the disease. The latest case, an elderly woman, contracted the virus in Good Heart Hospital, the health facility where the doctor who treated a Nigerian ECOWAS diplomat [contact of index case Sawyer from Liberia] died last week. The 2 others -- a doctor and a pharmacist -- tested negative. Even though they had been released from the centre, another round of tests will be carried out to reconfirm their status. ...

Amidst fear of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) spreading in Nigeria, the federal government is increasing its capacity to curtail the spread of the virus, the health minister said on Mon [1 Sep 2014].

The minister of health, Onyebuchi Chukwu, revealed on Monday [1 Sep 2014] during the 2nd emergency National Council on Health meeting on the EVD outbreak in Nigeria, which was held in Abuja, that the federal ministry of health has steadily been increasing capacity to diagnose EVD.

Mr Chukwu said the virus can now be diagnosed at the following locations: NCDC Laboratory, Asokoro, Abuja; NCDC Laboratory at LUTH, Lagos; NCDC Laboratory at University College Hospital, Ibadan; Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital Irrua, Edo State; Virology Laboratory of Redeemers University, Ogun State; the Irrua-based mobile laboratory, which has now been relocated from Enugu to Port Harcourt.

He stated that plans were at an advanced stage to enable the following laboratories: NCDC Laboratory at Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, Kano; NCDC Laboratory at UPTH, Port Harcourt, while the federal ministry of health plans to procure additional mobile laboratories to be based in the following locations: Abakaliki, Port Harcourt, Bauchi, Jos and Sokoto. ...

The minister further revealed that Nigeria has indicated interest to participate in the clinical trials for Ebola virus disease vaccines, adding that the country has also applied for experimental drugs such as TKM-Ebola: "The Treatment Research Group (TRG) has been working hard to identify experimental drugs like Zmapp and also to make recommendations to government on further research on these drugs as well as vaccines for EVD treatment and prevention. Following the TRG's recommendation and in consultation with NAFDAC and NHREC, Nigeria has indicated interest to participate in the clinical trials for 2 candidate EVD vaccines and is considering a 3rd that may be added to the list. We have also applied for experimental drugs such as TKM-Ebola.

"The TRG has submitted a detailed profile and brief on the oral antiviral agent which the Japanese Government has offered to make available to affected countries through the WHO. We are now considering the profile and brief to enable us to reach a final decision on making it available to our patients."

Liberia: nurses strike
----------------------
2 Sep 2014: (Reuters/AFP) Nurses on strike at Monrovia hospital are demanding protective equipment which they say has not been provided. [They are] demanding higher salaries as well as protective equipment against EVD. At the John F. Kennedy hospital in Monrovia, the nurses sought personal protective equipment, hazmat-style suits that protect against the spread of the disease, reports AFP.

Kaduna governmentt confirms there's a suspected case of Ebola at ABU.
2 Sep 2014: (PT) The Kaduna state government has confirmed that there is indeed a suspected case of Ebola virus disease in the state. ...
Premium Times had reported that a 19 year old law student at the Ahmadu Bello University was suspected to be down with the deadly Ebola virus in Kaduna and was on admission at the Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital, (ABUTH). As indicated in the report, Bilyaminu Umar, spokesperson for ABUTH, confirmed the development. But no sooner than our report was published, the spokesperson to the minister, Mr Nwomeh, took to the social media to say the story was false. "The Kaduna report is totally untrue," Mr Nwomeh tweeted.

But the [Kaduna] state commissioner of health, Dr Thot Dogo, has now confirmed the development to Premium Times. Mr Dogo said in a telephone interview: "That case is a case of a student who took ill; we are just suspecting the ebolavirus. So, we have taken his blood sample for test. ... The patient is on isolation in Zaria. By tomorrow [3 Sep 2014] in the afternoon, the result will be ready from Lagos. We have already gone there after the ABUTH authorities alerted us, and our rapid response team took the blood sample. He has been at the hospital for about a week now. It's only fever. But I think he developed rashes with redness of the eyes. So, we are just taking precautions. ..."

2 Sep 2014: (St Catharines Standard) There is only a remote possibility a patient in quarantine at the Niagara Health System's St Catharines Hospital [Ontario] was infected by the deadly ebolavirus, but doctors are taking no chances. The NHS has released few details about the patient -- including the person's gender, age, city of residence or nationality -- who was placed in isolation on Mon [1 Sep 2014]. The patient went to the St Catharines emergency department with flu-like symptoms after having recently traveled from the heart of the EVD outbreak in West Africa. The NHS declined to say which West African nation the person had visited. The outbreaks are in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.

[5] Harvests threatened

Residents of the West Point slum in Monrovia, Liberia received food aid on 21 Aug 2014. The EVD outbreak is putting food harvests in West Africa "at serious risk", the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) warns. It has raised a special alert for Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the 3 countries worst affected. Rice and maize production will be particularly affected during the coming harvest season, says the FAO. The food shortages are expected to worsen in the coming months. ...

In Monrovia, Liberia, a recently conducted rapid market assessment indicates that prices of some food items have increased rapidly, for example, in Monrovia's Redlight Market, the price of cassava went up 150 per cent within the 1st weeks of August [2014]. ...

"Even prior to the Ebola outbreak, households in some of the affected areas were spending up to 80 per cent of their incomes on food," said Vincent Martin, head of the FAO's Dakar-based Resilience Hub, which is coordinating the agency's emergency response. "These latest price spikes are effectively putting food completely out of their reach," he added.

To meet short-term food needs, the FAO has jointly approved an emergency programme with the UN's World Food Programme to deliver 65 000 tonnes of food to the estimated 1.3 million people affected by EVD over 3 months.

The depreciation of national currencies in Sierra Leone and Liberia in recent months is expected to exert further upward price pressure on imported food commodities. ...

"The ebolavirus is circulating in Central African wildlife, but conditions are perhaps not met for an epidemic to arise in the Central African Republic, the director of the Pasteur Institute of Bangui, Emmanuel Nakoune Yandoko, said on Mon 1 Sep 2014. "We captured animals such as rats, bats, monkeys and sibissi [giant cane rats, a national delicacy]. We sought ebolavirus, and we found it in the spleens of these animals," said Emmanuel Nakoune. ...
