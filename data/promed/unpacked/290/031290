The death toll from Haiti's cholera epidemic rose to 1603 on Thu 25 Nov
2010, up from 1415 just 2 days previously, according to the health ministry.

The outbreak has infected 69 776 people since it was 1st detected in
mid-October 2010, of whom 29 871 have been hospitalized, it said. To date,
146 have died of the virulent diarrheal disease in the destroyed capital of
Port-au-Prince, where more than a million people have been living in
sprawling tent cities since a January 2010 earthquake.

Officials fear the disease could spread quickly there because residents
have little access to proper sanitation. There have been isolated cases
beyond Haiti's borders, 4 in the neighboring Dominican Republic and 1 in
Miami, Florida.

[2] USA (Florida) ex Haiti

Health officials late Thu 25 Nov 2010 were investigating the possibility
that a passenger suffering from cholera arrived at Miami International
Airport on a flight from Haiti.

The man, whose name was not released, was a passenger on an American
Airlines flight sometime after 6 pm, sources told The Miami Herald. He was
said to be ill during the flight and told airline officials he was a doctor
who had been treating patients in Haiti and believed he had contracted the
disease.

A spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta
said that she could not confirm a suspected case of cholera in Miami.
Neither could Rob Hayes, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Health
in Tallahassee. If the cholera case were to be confirmed, it would be the
1st in Miami-Dade County and possibly the 3rd in Florida.

Earlier in Nov 2010, a Collier County woman who had returned from Haiti was
found to be suffering from the disease. She has recovered. A 2nd case is
suspected but has not been officially confirmed.
