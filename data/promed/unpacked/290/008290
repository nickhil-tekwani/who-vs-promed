Following the 3 confirmed Classical Swine Fever (CSF) outbreaks in the UK's
largest outdoor pig breeding company, MAFF has now decided to slaughter all
pigs on the company's 6 other nursery pig rearing farms and to restrict and
test the company's 6 finishing pig farms. The farms are scattered over 3
counties of the United Kingdom.
The company whose farms are infected is one of the pioneers of multi-site
swine production systems in the UK, which are designed to reduce
transmission of enzootic diseases by early weaning of pigs from the
breeding farm to a series of remote locations. Disease transmission from
older finishing pigs to young growing pigs (weaners) is avoided by having a
series of separate finishing farms. This approach was developed by Dr. Tom
Alexander of Cambridge University and Prof. Hank Harris of Iowa State
University (see <http://www.pighealth.com/multi-site.htm>) and has become
very popular in the last few years.
The drawback, however, of having so many interconnected farms is being seen
in this outbreak of a serious exotic disease.

Three farms in East Anglia were placed under quarantine amid fears they had
been hit by an outbreak of classical swine fever (CSF) threatening the
already struggling British pig farmers.
Vets from the Ministry of Agriculture were urgently tracing all recent
movements of pigs from the Norfolk farm, tracking down the lorries [trucks
used to move them and any subsequent consignments carried in the same
lorries. Any farms found to have received pigs face similar restrictions
while tests are carried out.
The fear is that the disease will already have spread. "If we can hold the
outbreak at this level we will have got off lightly," Elliott Morley, the
junior Agriculture Minister, said.
"We all remember how it hit the Dutch a couple of years ago," Mr. Morley
said. That epidemic led to the slaughter of a million pigs at a cost of
more than Â£1.5 billion.
Swine fever is a highly contagious viral disease passed on between animals,
in food, or between farms on the boots or tires of visitors and their
vehicles. Control is by slaughtering all pigs on an affected farm, whether
or not they have the disease.
The virus is harmless to human beings but can survive for very long periods
in frozen meat or in cured meats such as ham. Pigs, which are omnivorous,
can catch it from left-over scraps of pork in their food. [An excellent
reason to be sure scraps are thoroughly cooked before feeding. - Mod.TG
Ministry vets will also be trying to work out how the disease reached
Britain. There were many outbreaks on the [European Continent in 1988, but
at present the only CSF reported in the EU are a few cases in Germany.
Contaminated semen used for artificial insemination is a possibility and is
suspected of having caused the Dutch outbreak. Feed containing pig meat is
another possibility, as the virus can survive for years in frozen meat.
In continental Europe, the growing population of wild boar - now reckoned
to be at least a million strong in France and Germany alone - acts as a
reservoir for the virus. There are wild boar in Britain, originating from
escapes from specialists farms, but their numbers are in the hundreds, too
few to have any effect, and they have not been reported in East Anglia. The
Kent-East Sussex border and Dorset are the centers of Britain's wild boar
population.

The swine holdings, one in Norfolk, and one in Essex, will now have to
slaughter all 2 850 of their pigs. A farm in Suffolk had to slaughter all 3
500 of its pigs after becoming the first in the UK to be hit by the disease
for 14 years.
The affected holding in Norfolk is a breeding farm, and supplied pigs to
the farms in Essex and Suffolk. The Essex farm was near Colchester, while
the one in Norfolk was in the Thetford area.
A ministry spokesman said the pigs would be tested during the day to
determine which ones had the disease for valuation purposes. Slaughtering
the animals was expected to begin tomorrow.
Under European Union regulations, all pigs on infected farms must be
slaughtered and their carcases destroyed. Compensation is paid at 50
percent of the market value for infected animals and 100 percent of market
value for non-infected animals.
