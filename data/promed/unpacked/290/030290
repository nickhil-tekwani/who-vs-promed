["The top 10 countries globally in measles outbreaks are:
Yeman 1744, Nigeria 920, India 892, United Republic of Tanzania 875, Pakistan 707, Democratic Republic of Congo 582, China 466, Angola 460, Brazil 455, Burundi 375 [provisional data based on monthly data reported to WHO (Geneva) as of early December 2020. Data covers May 2020-October 2020. Reported measles case numbers are usually lower than actual numbers, so the number of cases in each country is likely higher than shown above.]

"COVID-19 is increasing the risk of measles outbreaks. Almost 41 countries have already put off, or may put off, their measles campaigns for 2020 or 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic." (https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/measles/data/global-measles-outbreaks.html)

"Measles cases and deaths surged worldwide last year [2019] to the highest number of cases in 23 years, says a report from the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

"COVID-19 has disrupted vaccine coverage in many countries and may lead to a further increase in cases and deaths from measles and other vaccine preventable diseases.

"Measles cases declined globally from 2010 to 2016 but have increased since then. In 2019 there were 869 770 cases of measles, the highest number since 1996, and an estimated 207 500 deaths, a 50% increase since 2016. The report called the numbers "a significant step backward." (Tanne JH. Measles cases and deaths are increasing worldwide, warn health agencies BMJ 2020; 371: m4450 https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4450).
