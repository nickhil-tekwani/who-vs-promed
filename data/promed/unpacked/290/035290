Outbreaks of the cattle disease nodular dermatitis [lumpy skin disease] were 1st recorded on the territory of the Orenburg oblast in July of this year [2017]. The 7 affected districts were Tashlinsky District (2 named villages), Sol-Iletsky District (3 villages), Novosergievsky District (1 village), Akbulaksky District (1 village), Ileksky District (1 village), Orenburg District (1 village) and Belyaevsky District (1 village). In the 10 affected locations, quarantines including restrictive measures were implemented.

The veterinary department of the Ministry of Agriculture and the food and processing industry of the Orenburg region took timely preventive and control measures to protect the livestock. Currently, the quarantine has been removed from affected holdings in the districts Novosergievsky, Tashlinsky and Ileksky. In the remaining locations, the quarantine measures will remain in force up to 30 days after the date of recovery or slaughter (destruction) of the last case on the premises.

[The continued spread of LSD in the 3 Russian provinces along Kazakhstan's western and northern borders is visually apparent in OIE's interactive map at http://tinyurl.com/y7y5xhf2 (click on the cluster, then zoom in). Since the start, on 5 Jun 2017, of the current LSD epizootic in Russia's provinces bordering Kazakhstan (the Saratovskaya, Samarkanskaya and Orenburskaya oblasts), 36 outbreaks have been reported as of 24 Aug 2017.

According to media reports and direct information from reliable sources, LSD is, most likely, currently circulating in western regions of Kazakhstan (Atyrau, probably also Aqtobe and West Kazakhstan) without being officially confirmed or duly reported to the OIE. The following information has been received in reponse to yesterday's (30 Aug 2017) RFI (see 20170830.5282993). - Mod.AS]

[2] Kazakhstan, vaccines applied, compensations to farmers.
Date: Thu, 31 Aug 2017
From: A reliable source known to ProMED who preferred to remain unnamed


In response to ProMED-mail's RFI in 20170830.5282993:

1. Two vaccines are being applied in Kazakhstan to protect cattle against LSD:
a. A Russian sheep pox vaccine (effectiveness under question) with unknown dosage;
b. Neethling homologous live attenuated vaccine Lumpivax (MSD Animal Health). This vaccine is produced in South Africa.

The information on a Kenyan vaccine as being applied in Kazakhstan is not confirmed.

2. In the absence of official diagnosis of LSD, farmers will not be entitled to receive compensation. However, in Kazakhstan, they may diagnose "pasteurellosis," and people will get their compensation that way. In such case, one will not know whether the actual case was related to LSD or another etiological disease agent.

[ProMED-mail is indebted to the submitter of the above information.

The comment on pasteurellosis (sometimes termed as hemorrhagic septicaemia), which is often a secondary infection, as a potentially substitutional diagnosis is rather concerning (see 20160717.4350687, 20160722.4362368, 20160723.4365082).

Kazakhstan's compliance with OIE standards, the quality of its national Veterinary Services for a timely and accurate diagnosis of suspected animal diseases, which is essential for their control, prevention and official notification; and the appropriateness of the country's veterinary legislation have been visited in the framework of OIE's PVS Pathway (see http://www.oie.int/support-to-oie-members/pvs-pathway/). Following visits of OIE's experts missions, comprehensive evaluation reports of the visited countries are issued, indicating and allowing required improvements or, ideally, confirming the satisfactory prevailing situations.

Out of the 131 missions already implemented, 33 countries have opted to waive the confidentiality of their evaluation reports and/or follow-up reports, which have thus become available on OIE's website at http://www.oie.int/support-to-oie-members/pvs-evaluations/oie-pvs-evaluation-reports/ and http://www.oie.int/support-to-oie-members/pvs-evaluations/follow-up-pvs-evaluations/).

The following 5 Central-Asian countries have been PVS-evaluated: Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Kyrgyzstan's report is publicly available. - Mod.AS
