Weeks after an outbreak of canine flu hit states across the country, Georgia now has its 1st confirmed case. The case was confirmed in metro Atlanta, and that has officials concerned that the pet has been in contact with other dogs in the area.

Veterinarians like Doctor Arhonda Johnson say the virus is very serious, even deadly. "Dogs can die from this," says Johnson. "There's a mild form, and there's a severe form, and it depends on what accompanies the disease. If they get pneumonia or a bacterial infection, they can die from it."

Johnson is urging dog owners to not wait until the last minute. The Georgia Veterinary Medical Association isn't sure how severe the case is here. We're told swab samples were taken from the dog to the University of Georgia where it was confirmed. Now the state is waiting to see whether it's linked to the cases in Chicago.

There are some signs you can look for in your pet to determine whether they have canine influenza: One obvious sign is if they're coughing. Other signs include nasal discharge, which could be accompanied with fever or pneumonia.

Your veterinarian can best help you identify whether these are signs of a canine flu. "Be proactive; don't let an epidemic start here; vaccinate and be done with it," said Johnson.

"If something happened to him, it would be horrible, so it's very important to me," [the dog's owner said]. "Doctor Johnson tells me they'll know more about this particular case on Wednesday [20 May 2015] when the results are back in. Canine flu vaccine shots cost USD 65.00.

[This article does not tell us which strain of canine influenza is present. It alludes to this being the new, more virulent strain of H3N2.

There is a vaccine available for the H3N8 strain; however, it is currently unknown whether the vaccine will provide protection from the new H3N2 strain. Preventative advice remains the same for the H3N2 (2004) strain [as for the H3N8 strain]. However, extreme vigilance regarding socializing of your canine pet is needed. Dog parks, doggie day care, grooming facilities, and kennels are places to be cautious of. A dog may be incubating this virus and capable of passing it to another dog before the owner recognizes the problem. The virus needs about 2-5 days incubation before clinical signs are obvious.
