A 46-year-old Asian elephant at the Saint Louis Zoo, has tested positive for tuberculosis, according to Zoo officials.

Veterinarians and the elephant care team at the Zoo are preparing to start the elephant on an appropriate treatment regimen, they said.

The Saint Louis Zoo said it has informed the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Missouri Department of Agriculture and other local agencies about the elephant's test results. Zoo officials said that she does not pose an exposure risk to Zoo visitors.

"Because the Saint Louis Zoo is dedicated to caring for animals, our established protocols have allowed us to detect this early and take necessary steps for this elephant," Dr. Luis Padilla, director of animal health at the Zoo, said in a statement. "Elephants with tuberculosis can be treated."

The Zoo routinely and proactively tests all of its elephants for tuberculosis as part of its comprehensive health monitoring program, officials said. The elephant was diagnosed through a combination of blood tests and a trunk culture, which is a part of the Zoo's regular veterinary care for elephants, the statement said.

In 2011 and 2012, the Zoo diagnosed and successfully treated another elephant for tuberculosis.

The elephant is not showing any symptoms at this time, according to officials. She will begin treatment with antibiotics and will remain with her family for social support.

Throughout her treatment, all of the other elephants in her family will be monitored regularly.

The elephant 1st came to the Saint Louis Zoo in July 2001, at age 29.

[Tuberculosis (TB) caused by _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ or _Mycobacterium bovis_ has recently re-emerged as an important infectious disease in zoo animals, particularly captive elephants. While TB has been recognized as a disease of elephants for over 20 centuries, increasing numbers of elephant TB cases have been reported in the past 2 decades. It has been reported that about 3 percent of captive elephants in the United States are infected with _M. tuberculosis_.
