Local Measles outbreak warning
---------------------------
Wiganers who have not had their measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccinations are being urged to do so. The plea from health authorities comes against the backdrop of a measles outbreak in the North West. Since the start of 2012, 440 cases have been confirmed in the region although the vast majority of the outbreaks have been in Merseyside. Greater Manchester has had only 15 confirmed cases with Wigan borough accounting for just two.

According to the Health Protection Agency, the Ashton, Wigan and Leigh area was amongst the highest in the country for the number of children before the age of two having their first dose of the MMR vaccine. But a HPA spokesperson warned that teens and young adults that missed out on being vaccinated when they were children remain at risk.

Measles can be passed on from spending as little as 15 minutes in the same room as a person with the virus. Anyone who is unsure as to whether they have been vaccinated are asked to contact their GP to confirm. Dr Rosemary McCann, Interim Director from the Greater Manchester Health Protection Unit said: "I can't stress enough the importance of parents in Wigan making sure their children have both doses of the MMR vaccine, which gives children life-long protection. "Parents of young children clearly value the protection that MMR provides but there are still too many children, teenagers and young adults who are not vaccinated who remain vulnerable. It's not too late for these groups. They should speak to their GP practice staff and arrange to be vaccinated now, especially with the new educational year fast approaching for students. "It's more important than ever to make sure vaccinations are fully up to
date."

Merseyside is suffering from the worst measles outbreak in the area since 1988 with 413 of the North West's confirmed cases in Cheshire and Merseyside. Cumbria and Lancashire have had 12 cases. A further 173 cases are still under investigation which means figures could still increase. There have been no deaths reported as a result of the current outbreak in the North West although some cases have resulted in serious illness requiring intensive care.

Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa witnesses sudden upssurge in measles cases
--------------------------------------------------------
The number of measles cases in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) is rapidly increasing and posing a threat to its population. However, since a majority of the population has been vaccinated against the fatal disease, questions are being asked as to why there has been a sudden emergence of such a large number of cases.

A total of 4048 cases have been reported in the first five months of this year across the province, with 1276 cases in Peshawar, 642 in DI Khan, 579 in Malakand, 352 in Swat and 180 in Bannu, according to data collected by the expanded programme on immunisation (EPI) in K-P. Appallingly, a majority of patients who tested positive for measles had been vaccinated against the virus for one to five years, leading many to suspect that the routine vaccinations were either ineffective or expired.

Out of 4084 cases in the province, 3029 children were administered vaccinations while the remaining 1019 were either outside vaccination coverage or their parents were not aware of the importance to provide them timely vaccinations. Dir Upper, Dir Lower and Lakki Marwat are the three districts where not a single child was vaccinated while a small number of vaccinations were reported in Bannu, Kohistan and Shangla districts. Officials believe that since the government provided vaccination free of charge, the coverage area in K-P managed to vaccinate most children. The officials claim that the recent emergence of cases was due to a poor diet, lack of awareness, poverty, low immunity levels and non-availability of clean drinking water.

The provincial health department only runs a mass campaign to vaccinate children against measles whenever there is a spike in the number of cases in the province, the official added. While Pakistan's struggle to eradicate polio is well known since authorities launched a major awareness campaign through print and electronic media, billboards, brochures, and sermons in mosques, measles which is also a preventable illness has been given no such coverage in the government's expanded programme on immunisation.

"No child from a rich family has been found positive for measles or polio and other diseases and it only hits poor families, which shows that they are deprived of basic necessities of life including proper food, drinking water, knowledge of cleanliness, and awareness of diseases," an official of the health department said, requesting anonymity.

The official went on to add that vaccination alone could not prevent measles since a poor diet, unclean drinking water and low immunity levels cancel out the effect of vaccinations even if they are administered several times. "Most drinking water pipelines are laid alongside the sewerage system and thus potable drinking water is contaminated which causes many fatal diseases," the official said, adding that the government needed to facilitate less-privileged people to improve living standards. Deputy Director EPI, K-P Dr Jan Baz Afridi told The Express Tribune that the programme would sanction an awareness campaign in their strategy against measles, adding that most cases were due to negligence of parents.

"We have provided injections of all diseases to all major hospitals of the province where the residents can get them without charge, but cases are still reported from many districts which shows that parents are not aware of such a facility," Dr Afridi said.

Measles outbreak: Ten UCs declared worst hit
--------------------------------------
District government and health department officials declared 10 union councils (UCs) [in Upper Dir] as worst affected by the measles outbreak. Briefing DCO Muhammad Ali Shah during a meeting, Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) Coordinator Dr Muhammad Gul said that the outbreak started two months ago. Later on, the DCO directed the department to start an anti-measles drive in these UCs and report to the DCO by 01 Sep 2012.

The Emergency [Officer] in charge at District Headquarters Hospital (DHQ) Hospital Dr Sahib Gul told The Express Tribune that more than 2000 patients with measles have been registered in the hospital since June, adding that none of them were vaccinated. However, no casualty [fatality] had yet been confirmed. Dr Gul said that two UCs, Jabar and Palam, were the worst hit areas. He complained that the government had launched a campaign but was not able to complete it.

District Supervisor for Vaccination Behre Karam said that they launched a campaign to provide immunisation against measles before June in which nearly 50% of the population, especially children under seven, were vaccinated.

"We will once again start the vaccination campaign after August 15 in the UCs to eradicate the disease. Before, we were not able to reach all the areas due to shortage of funds," he added. Karam further said that so far two children had died of measles in UC Kotki.

Measles case confirmed in Durham [Ontario]
-------------------------------------
The Durham Region Health Department has confirmed a local case of measles. "Although measles infection in our community is rare, the virus that causes it still circulates," says Regina Elliott, with the health department. "Individuals may be susceptible to measles if they were born after 1970 and have not received two doses of vaccine that protects against measles." Adults born prior to 1970 are assumed to have natural immunity to measles and do not need to be vaccinated.

Children are recommended to get two doses of the measles vaccine -- one at age one and another between ages four and six. Adults born after 1970 who only had one dose of the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine or do not know if they received the second dose, should receive another.

Measles virus is spread easily from person to person through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or by having direct contact with nose and throat secretions. Less commonly, it can also be spread through contact with articles freshly contaminated with nose and throat secretions. Measles symptoms include fever, runny nose, cough, drowsiness, irritability, soreness and redness of the eyes and small white spots in the mouth. A red blotchy rash appears on the third to seventh day, beginning on the face and spreading down the body.

Measles is contagious for four days before and four days after the start of the rash.
