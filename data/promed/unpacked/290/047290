A day after a farmer died due to suspected food poisoning and nearly 69 others fell ill, the police here [in Nashik, Maharashtra State] have registered offences against 2 caterers and an official of a pesticide producing company where the victims had a meal, an official said today [Thu 9 Nov 2017].

After eating the food served yesterday [Wed 9 Nov 2017] at Umarale village in Nashik district, where the private company had organised a seminar on tomato crops, at least 70 farmers had complained of vomiting and giddiness.

They were taken to different hospitals for treatment, Nashik's civil surgeon Suresh Jagadale said last night [Wed 9 Nov 2017].

Later, one of them, [AK] a 41-year-old victim, died, he said, adding the exact cause of his death was yet to be ascertained.

Samples of the food served to the farmers were sent for examination, Jagadale had said.

Following the incident, the Dindori rural police in Nashik late last night [Wed 9 Nov 2017] registered offences against the 2 caterers and the regional crop manager of the pesticide producing company under IPC sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and 328 (causing hurt by means of poison), Dindori police station in-charge Rajesh Shirsath said. An investigation was ongoing into the incident, he added.

Meanwhile, the health of farmers, who were admitted to Nashik Civil Hospital, a rural hospital in Dindori taluka and 3 private hospitals in the city, was improving, police said.

[There are very few symptoms mentioned except vomiting and giddiness. Yet, giddiness has several definitions: 1 - a sensation of whirling and a tendency to fall or stagger; dizziness or 2 - a state of excitable frivolity. If we consider giddiness as frivolity, then there are very few pesticides producing frivolity and vomiting.

However, if we take giddiness to mean dizziness, then other pesticides come to mind. But, if these are the only 2 signs, the possibilities become rather scant. We are only told of those 2 signs. Likely there were others which may have been ascertained by hospital staff.

Those 2 symptoms could fit a number of pesticides. But there would be other symptoms as well. Without more information, speculation could be quite wide. - Mod.TG
