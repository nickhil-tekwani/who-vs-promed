Altogether 12 people have died of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in Assam this year [2018].

Among the deaths, 3 were confirmed as Japanese encephalitis (JE) and another was caused by scrub typhus. But the Assam health department said it could not identify what really led to the deaths of the other 8 persons though they all showed symptoms of AES.

Health department officials said this year [2018], 29 Japanese encephalitis cases and 149 AES cases have been reported in Assam. A majority of the cases are from Dibrugarh which recorded 17 Japanese encephalitis cases and 51 AES cases.

The National Health Mission official in Guwahati, Umesh Phangso, said, "It is a national problem. It is difficult to diagnose the disease."

In Assam, 10 districts, namely Dhemaji, Tinsukia, Golaghat, Dibrugarh, Sivasagar, Jorhat, Lakhimpur, Sonitpur, Barpeta, and Odalguri have a high prevalence of JE and AES.

"The Dibrugarh-based Regional Medical Research Centre this year [2018] named 5 districts from the 10 "most prevalent" ones.

Those 5 districts are Tinsukia, Dibrugarh, Sivsagar, Jorhat, and Lakhimpur. We have given more stress in those 5 districts to control the disease," Phangso said.

Among the 3 deaths due to Japanese encephalitis, 2 persons, including a minor, had been vaccinated. Phangso said the 2 persons who died in Dibrugarh were vaccinated in 2016.

"We have ordered an inquiry. It could be that the vaccination was not carried out properly," Phangso said.

In 2017, nearly 17 percent of the deaths in the state was because of Japanese encephalitis. Of the 604 cases of confirmed last year [2017], 87 patients died.

Phangso said according to experts, all those cases may not be Japanese encephalitis but could be some other disease. Japanese encephalitis is most prevalent from May to September.

[The Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) transmission season is just beginning in northeastern India, including Assam state. As is often the case, a minority of AES cases are due to JEV infections. It is difficult to explain the deaths of individuals vaccinated against JEV in 2016. If the vaccine is killed virus, protective immunity may be of shorter duration than live, attenuated vaccines would provide. The etiology of AES has been unclear but debated in the past decade. A recent publication of investigations conducted during the 2014 and 2015 AES outbreaks indicated that scrub typhus, caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, was the etiology in about 60 percent of those AES cases. In the report above, there is just one case of scrub typhus.

As noted in many earlier posts, the determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. Various etiological agents have been proposed in recent years as responsible for AES cases. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, lychee fruit consumption and scrub typhus (_O. tsutsugamushi_). Recently, scrub typhus has been implicated in many AES cases. One hopes that these findings may stimulate prospective studies by ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) and other scientists as the season for occurrence of encephalitis cases in children is now beginning in northeastern India and many cases of encephalitis in children are likely to occur again this year (2018).
