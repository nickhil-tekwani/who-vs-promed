Outbreak of 'peste des petits ruminants' in Morocco
---------------------------------------------------
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is
helping Morocco deal with an outbreak of peste des petits ruminants
(PPR) that threatens to kill millions of sheep and goats and could
possibly spread to neighbouring countries. The outbreak has largely
affected sheep, with 133 outbreaks in 29 provinces so far.

PPR is a viral and very contagious disease of domestic goats and
sheep and small wild ruminants. It is transmitted through close
contact between animals. In its acute form it is characterized by
high fever, discharges from the eyes and nose, sores in the mouth,
lesions of the mucous membranes, laboured breathing, and diarrhoea.

Mortality rates can reach 80 percent in acute cases. In "super acute"
cases the mortality rate is 100 percent, with affected animals dying
in the 1st week. This is the 1st ever occurrence of the disease in
Morocco, which indicates that PPR has now crossed the natural barrier
of the Sahara and poses a risk to North Africa.

The origin of the outbreaks is currently unknown, but it is possible
the disease was introduced through the movement of live, infected
animals. For North African countries, the control of animal movements
over borders is difficult, especially in the southern part of the
region where herders follow a nomadic lifestyle. Morocco's sheep
population is 17 million and its goat population is 5 million. These
animals play an important role in supporting the livelihoods of
millions of families.

With the holy month of Ramadan having begun in September, and the Eid
Al-Adha celebration in December, trading in livestock, particularly
sheep, will increase markedly in North Africa. Without proper control
mechanisms, this could accelerate the spread of the virus, the FAO
warns. These outbreaks can lead to serious economic losses,
aggravated by imposed sanitary measures, controls on livestock
movements, and trade restrictions. Risk is also high for southern
European countries that maintain close trade relations with Morocco,
Spain in particular.

"In the event that the present scenario evolves to higher mortality,
the livelihoods of the affected herders would severely be at risk.
The economic impact might not be as great as in the case of
rinderpest in cattle, but the social impact would be greater,
considering the role played by small ruminants in the social life of
the affected communities," warned FAO Chief Veterinary Officer Joseph
Domenech.

Responding to a request for assistance from Moroccan authorities, the
FAO fielded a rapid response mission by the FAO/OIE's Crisis
Management Centre - Animal Health (CMC-AH) from 12-21 Aug 2008. The
team assisted with the establishment of urgent measures to control
and limit the spread of the disease.

The FAO's Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases (ECTAD)
convened an urgent 2-day meeting of all Chief Veterinary Officers
from the Maghreb region on 28-29 Aug 2008 in Tunisia. They agreed to
assist Morocco in its efforts to fight the PPR outbreak and requested
that the FAO help Moroccan authorities prepare an emergency
preparedness plan, ensure its implementation, and enhance
coordination among the veterinary services of the Maghreb and with
the veterinary services of neighbouring southern European countries.
The FAO is now mounting an urgent regional technical cooperation
project in response.

Prevention and control measures for PPR recommended by the FAO
include animal movement control, institution of quarantine on
affected or suspect farms, and medical prophylaxis (vaccination
around field outbreaks and in high risk areas). Regarding the
situation North Africa, the UN agency is also recommending that
countries:

- Review and revise animal disease emergency and contingency plans.
- Raise awareness and inform veterinarians, producers and the
different governmental services about PPR, its risks, and clinical
signs.
- Promote the prompt reporting of suspected cases to the authorities.
- Reinforce epidemiological surveillance in the zones of high risk.
- Improve inspection of sheep and goat flocks and institute animal
movement control procedures. The control and management of livestock
markets and the surveillance of suspected cases are of paramount
importance to contain the spread of the disease.

[Morocco has submitted to the OIE, so far, 4 follow-up reports on its
PPR situation, following the initial, immediate notification
submitted on 23 Jul 2008. See their summary and a map at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=7212>.

A special issue of "EMPRES WATCH," in English and French, dedicated
to PPR, has been prepared by the staff of the FAO's Emergency
Prevention System (EMPRES) for Transboundary Animal Diseases;
available at
<http://www.fao.org/docs/eims/upload//247342/aj120e00.pdf>. The
7-page document includes a useful, detailed review, illustrations,
maps and background information, as well as the details of 12
PPR-vaccine producers world-wide. The following text, derived from
the review, deserves attention:

"In the zones where the PPR is enzootic, the most severely affected
animals are those from 4 to 18-24 months of age. The infected animals
excrete large quantities of virus through nasal fluids, tears, saliva
and feces. Coughing and sneezing contributes to viral spread. The
animals in the immediate surrounding environment contract the virus
through respiratory channels. Water, food, mangers, watering holes,
and areas soiled by the viral materials represent other sources for
viral contamination, even though the virus will not persist for a
lengthy period of time in an exposed environment".

Though PPR virus mostly spreads only by close contacts between
infected and susceptible animals, neighboring countries, as well as
the South-European countries which maintain close trade and tourism
ties with Morocco, should exercise alertness and be prepared for the
possible need to identify suspected cases and test them. - Mod.AS]
