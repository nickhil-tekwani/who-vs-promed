and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.

Epidemiological comments: The USDA Animal and Plant Inspection
Service (APHIS) and the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) are
conducting a comprehensive epidemiological investigation of the event.
As of 19 Oct 2009, the summary of events is as follows:
- 2 Oct 2009: a 7-year-old Quarter Horse mare was presented ill to a
local veterinary hospital. A blood-borne pathogen was subsequently
suspected and the horse was placed in isolation and initial
diagnostic samples taken.
- 12 Oct 2009: the 7-year-old Quarter Horse tested positive for
equine piroplasmosis (_Theileria equi_) at the Texas Veterinary
Medical Diagnostic Laboratory.
- 13 Oct 2009: as part of a foreign animal disease (FAD)
investigation 31 horses epidemiologically linked with the index
animal were tested for equine piroplasmosis. Ticks were collected
from five horses for testing/speciation.
- 13 Oct 2009: a quarantine was placed on all horses on the premises
by the TAHC.
- 19 Oct 2009: the NVSL confirmed equine piroplasmosis (Theileria
equi) in the initial 7-year-old Quarter Horse and the 31 initial
epidemiologically linked horses.
- 19 Oct 2009: 96 additional epidemiologically linked horses were
tested for equine piroplasmosis. Results are pending.
- 19 Oct 2009: the tick investigation on the premises is continuing
and preliminary results of tick testing/speciation are pending.

Control measures
Measures applied: control of arthropods; quarantine; disinfection of
infected premises/establishment(s); dipping/spraying; vaccination
prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

[The report indicates that 96 epidemiologically linked animals are
currently being tested. The results from those tests will provide a
better picture of how extensive this outbreak actually is but
hopefully, environmental and management conditions have not changed
and the outbreak will remain isolated. In any case, the key to
resolving the outbreak and preventing further reoccurrence is to
prevent tick infestation, which is always the primary challenge in
any tick borne disease.

clinical, pathological, and diagnostic summary can be found in the
