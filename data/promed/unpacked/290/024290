An outbreak of a rare disease which kills rabbits in days has prompted
vets to urge owners to get their pets vaccinated.

Eastgate Vets have found 4 cases of viral haemorraghic disease (VHD)
in the last 2 weeks in the Mildenhall area [Suffolk].

Matt Wright, nurse at Eastgate, said he had never previously seen a
case of VHD in his 10-year career. "It's a horrible disease. The
rabbit will get sick, then will start to bleed before collapse and
death," he said.

Despite VHD being untreatable, Mr Wright said owners can get a
vaccination for the disease, which costs around BP 20 [USD 31]. [For

[Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) is a highly contagious and acute
fatal disease of the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_), caused
by a calicivirus (genus _Lagovirus_).

A similar disease, termed European brown hare syndrome (EBHS), has
been described in the hare (_Lepus europaeus_). Its aetiological agent
is a different species of lagovirus, antigenically related to the RHD
virus (RHDV).

RHD is characterised by high morbidity and high mortality (70-90
percent), and spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect
transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival, or oral
routes. Transmission of RHD is facilitated by the high stability of
the virus in the environment. The incubation period varies from 1 to 3
days, and death usually occurs 12-36 hours after the onset of fever.
The clinical manifestations have been described mainly in the acute
infection and are nervous and respiratory signs, apathy, and anorexia.
Clear and specific lesions, both gross and microscopic, are present.
There is primary liver necrosis and a massive disseminated
intravascular coagulopathy in all organs and tissues. The most severe
lesions are in the liver, trachea, and lungs. Petechiae are evident in
almost all organs and are accompanied by poor blood coagulation. In
rabbits younger than 4-5 weeks, the RHDV infection course is
subclinical.

The information above was derived from OIE's Terrestrial Manual
(chapter 2.6.2); the disease is one of the 2 lagomorph diseases
reportable to the OIE. The following vaccination guidelines are
derived from the same source:

"Most vaccine manufacturers recommend a single basic vaccination, with
yearly booster. Normally, a 1-ml dose is inoculated subcutaneously in
the neck region, or intramuscularly.The first injection should be
given at 2–3 months. In those units with no history of disease,
where the anamnesis for RHD is negative, it is advisable to vaccinate
only the breeding stock. Considering the high restocking rate in
industrial rabbit farms, the usual vaccination programme is to
administer the vaccine to all breeders, independently of their age,
every 6 months. This should ensure that all animals get at least one
vaccination per year. Booster
vaccination is strongly recommended to ensure a good level of
protection, although experimental data indicate that protection
usually lasts for a long time (over 1 year).

"Given the short life-cycle (approximately 80 days) of fattening
rabbits and their natural resistance to the disease until 35–40 days
of age, vaccinating these rabbits is not necessary if the situation on
the farm is normal, i.e. good biosecurity measures are applied and
there are no outbreaks of the disease in the area. Following an
outbreak of RHD, even if strict hygiene and sanitary measures are
adopted, including cleaning and disinfection, safe disposal of
carcasses and an interval before restocking, it is strongly
recommended to vaccinate meat animals at the age of 40 days, because
the incidence of re-infection is very high. Only after several
production cycles is it advisable to stop vaccination of meat animals.
To verify the persistence of infective RHD inside the unit, a
variable number of rabbits, starting with a small sentinel group,
should not be vaccinated.

"Given that immunity starts after about 7–10 days, vaccination could
also be considered a quite effective post-exposure treatment. In some
situations in particular it may be included in the emergency
strategies applied when RHD occurs on those farms having separate
sheds and where good biosecurity measures are regularly applied.
Indeed, better results in limiting the diffusion of the disease and
reducing economic losses could be obtained by using seroterapy through
the parenteral administration of anti-RHDV hyperimmune sera, which
produces a rapid, but short-lived, protection against RHDV infection.

Vaccine should be stored at 2–8°C and it should not be frozen, or
exposed to bright light or high temperatures".

RHD was 1st reported in 1984 in the People's Republic of China.
Currently, it is endemic in East Asia, Europe (including the UK), and
Oceania. Outbreaks have also been recorded in Central America (Mexico
and Cuba), USA, Saudi Arabia, West and North Africa. It appeared
recently for the 1st time in Canada. - Mod.AS]
