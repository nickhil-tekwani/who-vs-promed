Diphtheria in visitors to Africa
A case of cutaneous diphtheria has been reported in a 19 year old man who
returned to the UK at the end of June after spending several months in
Tanzania and other parts of Africa. A toxigenic strain of _Corynebacterium
diphtheriae_ var mitis was isolated from a small, deep leg wound. The
patient had been given a booster dose of diphtheria vaccine before
travelling to Tanzania. Apart from the leg wound his general health was
good.
He was treated with erythromycin and his close contacts were swabbed - a
booster dose of diphtheria vaccine was given to those with a history of
vaccination, but who had not had a booster in the past year. Contacts who
had no history of vaccination were treated with a course of erythromycin
and started on a primary course of diphtheria vaccine. A toxigenic strain
of _C. diphtheriae_ var mitis was isolated from the nasopharynx of two
asymptomatic contacts, who had travelled in Africa with the index case. All
isolates were referred to the PHLS Streptococcal and Diphtheria Reference
Unit for toxigenicity testing, further characterisation and molecular
typing. The three strains were found to be indistinguishable by molecular
typing.
Between 1993 and 1997 12 cases of infection due to imported toxigenic
strains of _C. diphtheriae_ were identified in England and Wales, of which
6 had cutaneous lesions. Cutaneous lesions are a major source of diphtheria
in tropical countries and although they are less likely to give rise to
toxic symptoms than pharyngeal infections, cutaneous diphtheria is readily
transmissible to close contacts who should be given prophylaxis according
to published guidelines.
