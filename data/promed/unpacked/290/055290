Testing of specimens from suspected Marburg virus disease victims has begun in Kabale District at the isolation centre set up at Rushoroza Health Centre III. The district health officer, Dr Patrick Tusiime, yesterday [28 Oct 2012] confirmed the development, saying donors from the United States Centres for Disease Control are funding the programme. "A field laboratory for testing samples from suspected victims has started operating. This will save us time and logistics that we have been spending to transport the samples to the Uganda Virus Research Institute in Entebbe," Dr Tusiime said. He said 8 patients are currently admitted at the isolation centre in critical condition, and the total number of people that got in close contact with the Marburg virus disease victims in Kabale district has increased from 198 to 204.

He said 2 more victims that died on Sat 26 Oct 2010 in their homes have been buried under strict supervision of epidemic experts in Muko and Maziba sub-counties. "The relatives of the deceased said they were bleeding from the nose, were vomiting, and had high body temperature," he said.

Student nurses from the Kabale School of Comprehensive Nursing and Kabale Health Institute have been temporarily stopped from going to the wards at Kabale Regional Referral Hospital for nursing practice to reduce congestion of health workers at the ward that might result in spread of the virus.

The Ministry of Health declared an outbreak of the Marburg virus in Kabale last week after 5 people were confirmed to have died of the disease. So far, 7 people have died as a result.

[Since the previous report posted earlier today (29 Oct 2012), the number of fatalities remains 7, whereas the number of people under surveillance has increased from 198 to 204. The availability of diagnostic testing on site in Kabale is a welcome development that should eliminate some of the ambiguities and ultimately aid the containment of the outbreak. - Mod.CP]

Seasonal Pulses of Marburg Virus Circulation in Juvenile _Rousettus aegyptiacus_ Bats Coincide with Periods of Increased Risk of Human Infection. [Authors: Amman BR, Carroll SA, Reed ZD, Sealy TK, Balinandi S, et al.]

Abstract:
-----------
Marburg virus (family _Filoviridae_) causes sporadic outbreaks of severe hemorrhagic disease in sub-Saharan Africa. Bats have been implicated as likely natural reservoir hosts based most recently on an investigation of cases among miners infected in 2007 at the Kitaka mine, Uganda, which contained a large population of Marburg virus-infected _Rousettus aegyptiacus_ fruit bats. Described here is an ecologic investigation of Python Cave, Uganda, where an American and a Dutch tourist acquired Marburg virus infection in December 2007 and July 2008. More than 40 000 _R. aegyptiacus_ were found in the cave and were the sole bat species present.

Between August 2008 and November 2009, 1622 bats were captured and tested for Marburg virus. Q-RT-PCR analysis of bat liver/spleen tissues indicated about 2.5 percent of the bats were actively infected, 7 of which yielded Marburg virus isolates. Moreover, Q-RT-PCR-positive lung, kidney, colon and reproductive tissues were found, consistent with potential for oral, urine, fecal or sexual transmission. The combined data for _R. aegyptiacus_ tested from Python Cave and Kitaka mine indicate low level horizontal transmission throughout the year. However, Q-RT-PCR data show distinct pulses of virus infection in older juvenile bats (about 6 months of age) that temporarily coincide with the peak twice-yearly birthing seasons. Retrospective analysis of historical human infections suspected to have been the result of discrete spillover events directly from nature found 83 percent (54/65) of events occurred during these seasonal pulses in virus circulation, perhaps demonstrating periods of increased risk of human infection. The discovery of 2 tags at Python Cave from bats marked at Kitaka mine, together with the close genetic linkages evident between viruses detected in geographically distant locations, are consistent with _R. aegyptiacus_ bats existing as a large meta-population with associated virus circulation over broad geographic ranges. These findings provide a basis for developing Marburg virus disease risk reduction strategies.

Author Summary:
--------------
Marburg virus, like its close relative Ebola virus, can cause large outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever with case fatalities nearing 90 percent. For decades, the identity of the natural reservoir was unknown. However, in 2007, Marburg viruses were isolated directly from Egyptian fruit bats (_Rousettus aegyptiacus_) that inhabited a Ugandan gold mine where miners were previously infected. Soon after, 2 tourists became infected with Marburg virus after visiting nearby Python Cave, a popular attraction in Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda. This cave also contained _R. aegyptiacus_ bats (around 40 000 animals). These events prompted a long-term investigation of Python Cave to determine if, 1) _R. aegyptiacus_ in the cave carried infectious Marburg virus genetically similar to that found in the tourists, and 2) [to determine] what ecological factors might influence virus spillover to humans. In the study, we found that, 1) approximately 2.5 percent of the bat colony is actively infected at any one time and that virus isolates from bats are genetically similar to those from infected tourists, and 2) specific age groups of bats (juveniles around 6 months of age) are particularly likely to be infected at specific times of the year that roughly coincide with historical dates of Marburg virus spillover into humans.

The above research further implicates fruit bats as the source of the virus responsible for the sporadic outbreaks of the highly lethal Marburg virus in the human populations of West Africa. The availability of on-site diagnostics is a significant development that should accelerate the containment of Marburg disease outbreaks. - Mod.CP
