We had a clear outbreak situation in May, 1993 at the University of
Connecticut which was quite different from the situation as described in
Rhode Island. In a 72 hour period there were 3 cases of Group A
meningococcal septicemia/meningitis among students who had no known common
contacts. This led us to conclude that the bacterium was circulating
widely in the community.
Over the following week a campaign was mounted in which nearly 12,000
University of Connecticut students/staff/faculty were immunized (the key to
the success of the campaign which occurred during exam period over Mother's
Day weekend appeared to be the free Ben & Jerry's ice cream we handed out
to all individuals post-vaccination!). No more cases developed. All three
students made a full recovery and returned to school the following semester.
Each year there are about 20 reported cases of invasive meningococcal
disease in Connecticut. What made this unique was the time-space cluster.

I would be interested in knowing what Rhode Island's meningitis rates are
for the past six years, or just last year. If these eleven cases are not
considered as an outbreak then why the mass immunization initiative? I
guess it's what you are used too. For an example, Georgia has had, on an
average, 97 cases of meningitis over the past six years with a mortality
rate of 7%. It's well known that there is a 5-10% mortality rate with this
infection. Last year Georgia reported 104 cases and 12 deaths, this is
expected, no mass immunization indicated! So I guess it's what you expect.
If Rhode Island expected only one or two cases for the entire year, and
have eleven within the first two months of the year then they need to be
concern.

[The data were a bit unclear from the news reports that I summarized last
evening, but there is some indication that Rhode Island experienced only 2
cases of meningococcal meningitis "last year". There is also an indication
that during 1996-1997 approximately twice as many cases were seen as
compared to 1994-1995. That's fragmentary at best, perhaps someone with
the real numbers could enlighten us. - Mod.ES
