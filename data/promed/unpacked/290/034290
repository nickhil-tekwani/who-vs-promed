Transboundary animal diseases on the rise: FAO and OIE strengthen cooperation
--------------------------------------------------
In response to an increase in transboundary animal diseases, the World
Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and FAO have decided to strengthen
their collaboration.
Animal diseases spreading between countries, such as foot-and-mouth disease
and avian influenza, are often having a severe economic and social impact,
the 2 agencies said in joint statement today.
FAO and OIE called upon countries and donors to invest more in the control
of contagious transboundary animal diseases. Such animal diseases are on
the rise as a result of international trade and the movement of people and
animals.
"Animal diseases that cross borders need an immediate and effective
regional or international response," the 2 agencies said.
FAO and OIE have decided to set up a global information and early warning
system on highly contagious transboundary animal diseases.
"In an emergency situation, the rapid distribution of information and an
improved coordination between countries is essential to control contagious
diseases. This will help to protect people against diseases of animal
origin and prevent the risk of diseases spreading into other countries,"
FAO/OIE said.
The new FAO/OIE agreement, signed on 24 May 2004, clarifies the areas of
competence of the 2 agencies and will improve synergies.
While OIE is a body that collects official information provided by
countries, sets standards and guidelines and issues recommendations on
safety of international trade of animals and animal products, on animal
health and zoonoses, FAO advises countries on good agricultural practices,
disease control and eradication methods.
Both agencies assist countries in building their surveillance and early
warning systems.

[This is an encouraging, positive step forward, probably precipitated by
the major epizootics in recent years and finally boosted by the current
HPAI panzootic in Eastern Asia. ProMED-mail warmly applauds the endeavor to
strengthen the needed synergy between the FAO and the OIE and consequently
to provide assistance, especially to developing countries, in improving the
performance of their disease surveillance and reporting systems. This step
is also well-timed with OIE's contemplated changes in the animal disease
notification system. (ref 20040516.1319). - Mod.AS]
