Patients recalled for HIV & hepatitis B tests
-----------------------------------------------
Hundreds of patients treated by a health care worker diagnosed with
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus are being
recalled. Letters have been sent to 1185 people treated in the West
Midlands and Southampton over the last 6 years. A NHS spokeswoman
said it was "highly unusual" to have a health worker contract both
infections. No patient who has had contact with the worker has been
diagnosed with the infections, but there is a "small risk" of
transmission, the spokeswoman said.
Nearly all the patients contacted were treated in the West Midlands,
with 24 people in the Southampton area also being notified. The
recalled patients are being asked to call confidential help lines and
to attend clinics for blood tests. The worker in question worked in
orthopedics at Redditch's Alexandra Hospital, Kidderminster Hospital,
the Orthopedic Hospital in Birmingham, and Evesham Community
Hospital. A spokeswoman for the West Midlands Strategic Health
Authority said the worker had no symptoms and was unaware of the
infections. The symptoms were picked up by a recent occupational
health assessment. Since that time, the worker has not been involved
in any work that may place patients at risk.
Regional public health director Dr. Rashmi Shukla said: "This is a
highly unusual, if not unique, set of circumstances, in that the
healthcare worker is infected with both HIV and hepatitis B virus.
Hospitals have sent letters directly to all the patients who may be
affected. There is no recorded case of transmission of HIV from an
infected health care worker to a patient in the UK, and the chance of
an infected health care worker passing hepatitis B virus to a patient
is low. However, there is a chance of infection, and I would
recommend patients to take the tests if they have received a
notification letter."
Dr. Sue Ibbotson of the Health Protection Agency said that, following
national guidelines, the worker would have been screened for
hepatitis B virus infection when employed by the NHS [National Health
Service]. But she said no such guidelines existed for HIV screening.
New staff are asked whether they fall into a high risk category for
the virus. If they do, they are tested, but this test is a one-off,
and is not repeated regularly during their employment, she added.

[The risk of transmission is remote in view of the specialty of the
healthcare worker involved and the absence of transmission of HIV
infection in a healthcare setting in the UK previously. However,
there is always a 1st time, and the recall of patients for HIV and
hepatitis B tests is a prudent measure. - Mod.CP]
