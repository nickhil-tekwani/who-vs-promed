The San Joaquin County Mosquito and Vector Control District's (district) mosquito surveillance system has detected the invasive yellow fever mosquito (_Aedes aegypti_) in the Brookside area of Stockton. "With this find, this invasive mosquito has survived the winter and continues to populate," said Aaron Devencenzi, public information officer of the district. "The yellow fever mosquito is very difficult to control, so public call-ins are very important."

_Ae. aegypti_ is a small (about one-quarter inch; 5mm) black and white mosquito that bites aggressively during the day. The public can help prevent the spread of these invasive mosquitoes by calling in daytime-biting mosquitoes to the district. The district will continue surveillance efforts by placing traps used to collect adult mosquitoes and mosquito eggs. Additional efforts may include the district's staff conducting door-to-door inspections of the residential area near the recent _Ae. aegypti_ detection.

_Ae. aegypti_ is not native to California. It has become established in some areas of southern and central California. Since 2019, it was found in San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Sacramento, and Placer counties. _Ae. aegypti_ can transmit several viruses, including dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and yellow fever. _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes do not currently transmit these viruses in California.

The public's help is crucial in controlling the spread of this mosquito population. _Ae. aegypti_ lays its eggs just above the water line in small containers and vessels that hold water, such as dishes under potted plants, birdbaths, ornamental fountains, tin cans, or discarded tires. Residents should inspect around their yard and outside their homes and dump out even the smallest amount of standing water. Be sure to clean and scrub bird baths and pet watering dishes weekly and dump the water from overflow dishes under potted plants. Also, remove any unnecessary containers and trash around properties.

Residents experiencing mosquito bites during the day should report them immediately to San Joaquin County Mosquito & Vector Control District at (209) 982-4675, 1-800-300-4675, or <www.sjmosquito.org>.

[The above report indicates that _Aedes aegypti_ has survived the cool winter months in San Joaquin County. The seasonal low temperatures there are 39 deg F (4 deg C), so these mosquitoes can survive in shelter places and resume breeding with the onset of warmer weather. The above report does not indicate how abundant this mosquito is in the areas where it was recently found. Should an individual viremic with dengue, chikungunya, or Zika virus infections come to this area, ongoing transmission would require relatively abundant population of this vector mosquito.

_Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes have been detected in an increasing number of California localities over the past 4 years. Once well established, this mosquito is difficult to eradicate. Control requires considerable continuous effort. A recent report describes automated processes to rear and release millions of competitive, sterile male _Wolbachia_-infected _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes, and use of these males in a large-scale suppression trial in Fresno County, California. In 2018, 14.4 million males were released across 3 replicate neighborhoods encompassing 293 hectares [724 acres]. At peak mosquito season, the number of female mosquitoes was 95.5% lower (95% CI, 93.6-96.9) in release areas compared to non-release areas, with the most geographically isolated neighborhood reaching a 99% reduction. This work demonstrates the high efficacy of mosquito sterile insect technique in an area 9-fold larger than in previous similar trials, supporting the potential of this approach in public health and nuisance-mosquito eradication programs (see Invasive mosquito - USA: (CA) control 20200408.7197860). - Mod.TY
