[It has been reported that] scientists have discovered a simple way to
dramatically reduce the risk of people getting sick from _E. coli_-tainted
beef: Change what cattle eat for a few days before they're slaughtered.
The story quoted USDA microbiologist James Russell, who did the study while
stationed at Cornell, as saying, "It's a way of attacking the problem long
before the animal reaches the slaughterhouse, the meat reaches the
supermarket or the meat is prepared by the consumer. We're very hopeful"
the result will be far fewer sick Americans.
Robert Buchanan of the Food and Drug Administration, lead scientist for the
Clinton administration's food safety initiative, was quoted as saying,
"This looks to be a relatively inexpensive, potentially important
intervention that farmers can do." And it would save farmers money. "Hay is
a lot cheaper than oats," Buchanan noted.
Gary Cowman, quality assurance chief for the National Cattlemen's Beef
Association was quoted as saying, "We think it's a major breakthrough. It's
something very, very practical."
But there are still questions to be answered, he cautioned, including
whether abruptly changing a cow's diet from starchy grain to fibrous hay
overnight would cause digestive problems. Cowman said more research should
settle those concerns within a year.
