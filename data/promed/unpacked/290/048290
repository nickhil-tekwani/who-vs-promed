SQUIRREL BRAINS, SOURCE OF INFECTIOUS AGENT? (02)

Just a small reminder that the expected number of CJD cases in the US should
be (and probably is) some 250 per year. Collecting cases for "squirrel brain
eaters" over several years (perhaps effectively over 10 yrs) gives you circa
2500 cases in total. If consumption is rather more common than one might
expect (i.e., a lot of hunters do it) then these numbers may be nothing more
than chance.
On the continent of Europe consuming brains is very common and often regarded
as a delicacy. Indeed my grandmother always gave her young (city-bred)
grandchildren pig's brains on toast as a pick-me-up when they arrived after
the long journey. She got this from her French grandmother. They looked
(ugh!) dreadful, but actually tasted delicious (refusal was not an option,
believe me). Probably full of essential fatty acids too. Anyway, there
doesn't appear to be any greater incidence of CJD in Europe, than in the US.
One should be cautious of jumping [hopping?] to conclusions.
Also a reminder that, at least in the UK, squirrels are known to eat birds
eggs. It might be wrong to assume they are exclusively vegetarian, most
rodents seem to be happy to eat any meat they come across.

So, 5 people diagnosed as having CJD reported that they has eaten squirrel
brains! I guess that just about proves it, doesn't it? Of course, I'd bet
that there are some cynics out there who might wonder whether they also drank
coffee, which, after all, is reported to exert a neuropharmacological effect
in some people. Has anybody every determined just how many CJD sufferers
drank coffee? Or how many CJD sufferers did not eat squirrel brains? In my
country there are no squirrels. We do however drink coffee and we also
report cases of CJD. Scary stuff, eh?

[Oz' own King James I (1566-1625) said, "He was a bold man who first
swallowed an oyster." and Sophia Loren said, "Everything you see, I owe to
spaghetti". Stu's right. I was thinking of putting together a "Roadkill
Cookbook" as a fund raiser for ProMED-mail but thought better of it. Given
that we all have more to do than to continue this apparently irrelevant
string, let's just cut it here. -- Mod CHC]
