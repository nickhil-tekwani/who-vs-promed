The 1st ever diagnosed case of chikungunya in New Caledonia was
confirmed Friday [25 Feb 2011] by the authorities of the French
Overseas Territory. They reported that the patient recovered today.
The patient whose age and sex were not disclosed was infected during a
trip to Indonesia.

"The victim recovered but it is indeed the 1st local case of
chikungunya in New Caledonia", explained the Dr. Jean-Paul Grangeon,
chief of service of the health department for the government of New
Caledonia. "Since 2005, 3 other cases were diagnosed in La Reunion,
but they were no longer contagious upon their arrival on the [New
Caledonia] territory. This time, the patient showed the 1st signs on
the plane upon returning and the virus was present in his blood when
he arrived", he added.

The local authorities are concerned about the virus. "Because of the
important risk of an outbreak in a population totally free from the
disease and not vaccinated it is essential that the population
strictly follows orders on how to destroy the mosquito breeding
sites," insists the government.

Chikungunya is a virus similar [in its transmission, not its taxonomy
- Mod.TY] to the dengue virus, transmitted by the same vector, the
_Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, quite common in New Caledonia. After an
incubation of 4 to 7 days in average, the clinical signs are very
close to those of the dengue: high fever accompanied by pains in the
joints and the muscles, headaches and often skin rash. There may be
severe forms, hemorrhagic or that can impair other organs requiring
hospitalization.

A serious outbreak of chikungunya hit La Reunion 5 years ago. Between
December 2005 and December 2006, 266 000 people were infected with the
virus on this island and 250 died.

[There is justifiable concern about the introduction of chikungunya
virus into an environment where the mosquito vector is abundant.
Apparently, there was no additional ongoing transmission of the virus
on New Caledonia. Unfortunately, this report does not indicate where
in Indonesia the infection was acquired.
