[According to WHO the situation for malaria in
Georgia started to deteriorate beginning from mid
1990s. The peak of the morbidity occurred in
2002, when 473 local cases were registered. The
incidence of malaria between 1998 and 2002
increased 30 fold. The situation improved in
2007, when only 24 cases registered after
preventive measure were taken. Currently the
highest risk of malaria exists in the neighboring
regions with Armenia, Azerbaijan and also in the
lowlands of Kolkhida. - Corr.BA]

[The term "tropical malaria" implies that the
cases are due to _Plasmodium falciparum_.
Transmission of _P.falciparum_ requires an
average 24 hour temperature of 20 deg C [68 deg
F] and transmission in Georgia is therefore not
possible in the winter.

The WHO regional Office for Europe, Centralized
Information System for Infectious Diseases
(CISID) reports the following number of
autochthonous malaria with no information on
species
(<http://data.euro.who.int/cisid/Default.aspx?TabID=224577>):
1990 Â– 1995: no cases reported
1996: 3
1997: 0
1998: 14
1999: 35
2000: 244
2001: 437
2002: 473
2003: 308
2004: 254
2005: 154
2006: 58
2007: 24
