Johnston County Hams is recalling approximately 89 096 pounds of ready-to-eat ham products that may contain _Listeria monocytogenes_, according to the United States Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). The recall was announced after several people fell ill and one died.

The recall includes products that were produced between 3 Apr last year [2017] and 2 Oct this year [2018]. "The epidemiologic investigation identified a total of 4 listeriosis-confirmed illnesses, including one death, between 8 Jul 2017, and 11 Aug 2018," the recall announcement said.

Among the products recalled include:
- "Johnston County Hams, Inc. Country Style Fully Cooked Boneless Deli Ham;"
- "Ole Fashioned Sugar Cured Old Dominion Brand Hams Premium Fully-Cooked Country Ham" with sell-by dates between 10 Apr and 19 Sep 2018;
- "Padow's Hams and Deli, Inc. Fully Cooked Country Ham Boneless Glazed with Brown Sugar;"
- "Premium Fully Cooked Country Ham Less Salt Distributed By Valley Country Hams LLC" with sell-by dates from 10 Apr 2018, through 27 Sep 2019, and;
- "Goodnight Brothers Country Ham Boneless Fully Cooked."

The labels of the potentially tainted products can be found here [see source URL]. The recalled products have the establishment number "EST. M2646" inside the USDA mark of inspection. The recall came after the FSIS was notified that a person was ill with listeriosis on 27 Sep [2018] after consuming a ham product produced at Johnston County Hams.

Officials said that "working in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state public health and agriculture partners, FSIS determined that there is a link between the _Listeria monocytogenes_ illnesses and ham products produced at Johnston County Hams."

According to the FSIS, consumption of food contaminated with _L. monocytogenes_ can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

"Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, there can be serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems."

[The epidemiologic investigation has identified 4 confirmed cases of listeriosis, including one death, between 8 Jul 2017 and 11 Aug 2018. Whole genome sequencing of isolates from 2 deli ham product samples collected at the Johnston County Hams, Inc. facility in 2016 and in early 2018 has been reported to show that _Listeria monocytogenes_ identified in deli ham both years was closely related genetically to _L. monocytogenes_ from outbreak patients (https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts/recall-case-archive/archive/2018/recall-084-2018-release).

_Listeria monocytogenes_ is able to multiply at refrigerator temperatures. _Listeria_-contaminated, refrigerated ready-to eat products that do not require further cooking before eating, such as smoked salmon or cold cut meats, such as ham, are recognized potential sources for listeriosis. - Mod.ML
