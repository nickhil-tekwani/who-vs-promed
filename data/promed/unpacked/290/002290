WHO statement on the meeting of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee concerning the international spread of wild poliovirus
WHO Statement: 5 May 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Emergency Committee convened by the Director-General under the International Health Regulations (2005) [IHR (2005)] was held by teleconference on Monday [28 Apr 2014] from 13:30 to 17:30 Geneva time (CET) and on Tuesday [29 Apr 2014] from 13:30 to 19:00 Geneva time (CET).

Members of the Emergency Committee and expert advisors to the Committee met on both days of the meeting. [The list of committee members can be found at http://www.who.int/ihr/procedures/emerg_comm_members_2014/en/]. The following affected States Parties participated in the informational session of the meeting on Monday [28 Apr 2014]: Afghanistan, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Israel, Nigeria, Pakistan, Somalia, and the Syrian Arab Republic.

During the informational session, the WHO Secretariat provided an update on and assessment of recent progress in stopping endemic and imported polioviruses and the international spread of wild polioviruses in 2014 as of [26 Apr 2014]. The above affected States Parties presented on recent developments in their countries.

After discussion and deliberation on the information provided, and in the context of the global polio eradication initiative, the Committee advised that the international spread of polio to date in 2014 constitutes an 'extraordinary event' and a public health risk to other States for which a coordinated international response is essential. The current situation stands in stark contrast to the near-cessation of international spread of wild poliovirus from January 2012 through the 2013 low transmission season for this disease (that is, January to April). If unchecked, this situation could result in failure to eradicate globally one of the world's most serious vaccine preventable diseases. It was the unanimous view of the Committee that the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have been met.

At end-2013, 60 percent of polio cases were the result of international spread of wild poliovirus, and there was increasing evidence that adult travellers contributed to this spread. During the 2014 low transmission season there has already been international spread of wild poliovirus from 3 of the 10 States that are currently infected: in central Asia (from Pakistan to Afghanistan), in the Middle East (Syrian Arab Republic to Iraq), and in Central Africa (Cameroon to Equatorial Guinea). A coordinated international response is deemed essential to stop this international spread of wild poliovirus and to prevent new spread with the onset of the high transmission season in May/June 2014; unilateral measures may prove less effective in stopping international spread than a coordinated response. The consequences of further international spread are particularly acute today given the large number of polio-free but conflict-torn and fragile States which have severely compromised routine immunization services and are at high risk of re-infection. Such States would experience extreme difficulty in mounting an effective response were wild poliovirus to be reintroduced. As much international spread occurs across land borders, WHO should continue to facilitate a coordinated regional approach to accelerate interruption of virus transmission in each epidemiologic zone.

The over-riding priority for all polio-infected States must be to interrupt wild poliovirus transmission within their borders as rapidly as possible through the immediate and full application in all geographic areas of the polio eradication strategies, specifically: supplementary immunization campaigns with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), surveillance for poliovirus, and routine immunization. The Committee provided the following advice to the Director-General for her consideration to reduce the international spread of wild poliovirus, based on a risk stratification of the 10 States with active transmission (that is, within the previous 6 months) as of [29 Apr 2014].

States currently exporting wild poliovirus
------------------------------------------
Pakistan, Cameroon, and the Syrian Arab Republic pose the greatest risk of further wild poliovirus exportations in 2014. These States should:
- officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency;
- ensure that all residents and long-term visitors (that is, greater than 4 weeks) receive a dose of OPV or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) between 4 weeks and 12 months prior to international travel;
- ensure that those undertaking urgent travel (that is, within 4 weeks), who have not received a dose of OPV or IPV in the previous 4 weeks to 12 months, receive a dose of polio vaccine at least by the time of departure as this will still provide benefit, particularly for frequent travellers;
- ensure that such travellers are provided with an International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis in the form specified in Annex 6 of the International Health Regulations (2005) to record their polio vaccination and serve as proof of vaccination;
- maintain these measures until the following criteria have been met: (i) at least 6 months have passed without new exportations and (ii) there is documentation of full application of high quality eradication activities in all infected and high risk areas; in the absence of such documentation these measures should be maintained until at least 12 months have passed without new exportations.

Once a State has met the criteria to be assessed as no longer exporting wild poliovirus, it should continue to be considered as an infected State until such time as it has met the criteria to be removed from that category.

States infected with wild poliovirus but not currently exporting
----------------------------------------------------------------
Afghanistan, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Iraq, Israel, Somalia, and particularly Nigeria, given the international spread from that State historically, pose an ongoing risk for new wild poliovirus exportations in 2014. These States should:
- officially declare, if not already done, at the level of head of state or government, that the interruption of poliovirus transmission is a national public health emergency;
- encourage residents and long-term visitors to receive a dose of OPV or IPV 4 weeks to 12 months prior to international travel; those undertaking urgent travel (i.e. within 4 weeks) should be encouraged to receive a dose at least by the time of departure;
- ensure that travellers who receive such vaccination have access to an appropriate document to record their polio vaccination status;
maintain these measures until the following criteria have been met: (i) at least 6 months have passed without the detection of wild poliovirus transmission in the country from any source, and (ii) there is documentation of full application of high quality eradication activities in all infected and high risk areas; in the absence of such documentation these measures should be maintained until at least 12 months have passed without new exportations.

Any polio-free State which becomes infected with wild poliovirus should immediately implement the advice for 'States infected with wild poliovirus but not currently exporting'. The WHO Director-General should ensure an international assessment of the outbreak response is undertaken within 1 month of confirmation of the index case in any State which becomes newly infected. In the event of new international spread from an infected State, that State should immediately implement the vaccination requirements for 'States currently exporting wild poliovirus'.

WHO and its partners should support States in implementing these recommendations.

Based on this advice, the reports made by affected States Parties and the currently available information, the Director-General accepted the Committee's assessment and on 5 May 2014 declared the international spread of wild poliovirus in 2014 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The Director-General endorsed the Committee's advice for 'States currently exporting wild polioviruses' and for 'States infected with wild poliovirus but not currently exporting' and issued them as Temporary Recommendations under the IHR (2005) to reduce the international spread of wild poliovirus, effective 5 May 2014. The Director-General thanked the Committee Members and Advisors for their advice and requested their reassessment of this situation in 3 months, particularly as the criteria for discontinuing these measures could for some States extend beyond the 3 months validity of these Temporary Recommendations.

[This is now the 3rd health event that has led to meetings of the IHR Emergency Committee. The other 2 topics were influenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (http://www.who.int/ihr/ihr_ec/en/) and MERS-CoV (http://www.who.int/ihr/ihr_ec_2013/en/). A necessary step for continuation of the goal of polio eradication.

In a discussion with a colleague last week, this moderator mentioned the probable need for a major coordinated international push to interrupt transmission of the wild poliovirus (WPV) in Asia, the Middle East, and in Africa simultaneously. Unfortunately, unlike smallpox where there were very few to none asymptomatic carriers of the smallpox virus, so silent transmission was not a significant issue, infection with poliovirus leads to paralytic disease for an average of 1 individual out of every 200 infected individuals (the actual range cited in the literature ranges from 1 in 50 to 1 in 1000), so that for every paralytic case that is identified through acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance, there are an average of 199 others who are infected with the WPV and are continuing to transmit the virus to susceptible contacts.

A good "case study", illustration of the challenges of asymptomatic infections is the situation in the Middle East -- a WPV genetically similar to those circulating in Pakistan was identified in sewage samples in Egypt in late 2012. No paralytic cases were identified associated with this WPV in Egypt. Several months later, sewage samples in Southern Israel were found to have WPVs, also genetically related to those circulating in Pakistan. Again, no paralytic cases were associated with these WPV isolates. During the course of 2013 and continuing into 2014, WPVs were identified in sewage samples travelling northward throughout Israel and in the Gaza strip and West Bank. Again, no paralytic cases were identified associated with these WPV isolates. In late 2013, paralytic cases were identified in Syria (which borders with northern Israel); the WPV associated with these cases in Syria was genetically related to those circulating in Pakistan. In early 2014, a paralytic case was identified in Iraq, again, a WPV was identified that was genetically related to those circulating in Pakistan. This 12 month history following WPV isolates not associated with clinical illnesses that were identified until the 1st paralytic cases were identified several countries distant from where the 1st isolates were found is a good example of how the WPV can travel silently and cover significant geographic territory before its presence is "announced" through a paralytic case appearing.

A question one asks is how much environmental sampling for WPVs is ongoing in African countries that have theoretically been WPV free (defined as no AFP cases from whom WPV has been identified). Another example of this type of silent circulation of the WPV was seen in September 2010 when there was a case of WPV associated paralytic disease in Uganda. The WPV identified was genetically related to a WPV that had been isolated from a paralytic case in the Turkana area of North West Kenya in February 2009. In that instance, the WPV had been silently circulating in the region for 19 months before it was identified in another paralytic case.

In reviewing the measures proposed by the IHR Emergency Committee, this is the 1st time that proof of recent vaccination with one of the childhood vaccines is being mandated for individuals coming from known "exporting" countries, and recommended for those coming from known infected countries. One wonders if a collateral action that polio free countries will take is to mandate vaccination at arrival for those travellers who do not have proof of recent vaccination against polio -- an action that countries used to take with respect to cholera vaccination and are still taking with respect to yellow fever vaccination.

One hopes that the international effort will be able to overcome the barriers to conducting vaccination activities in the areas of civil strife, and overcome the barriers of misinformation and anti-vaccination propaganda disseminated in these areas. - Mod.MPP]

Highlights of the week
----------------------
- The World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General, Dr Margaret Chan, is convening an Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations to advise on whether the current developments on the spread of poliovirus constitute a public health emergency of international concern and, if so, whether temporary recommendations are needed to reduce the risk and consequences of international spread. The Committee began consultations on [28 Apr 2014], and is expected to deliberate for several days.
- In Nigeria, the Expert Review Committee on Polio Eradication and Routine Immunization (ERC) convened in Abuja from [23-24 Apr 2014], to review the current polio epidemiology in the country. The ERC concluded that as a result of significant programme improvements including significant decline in WPV cases and increase in the quality of supplementary immunization activities (SIAs), the next 8 months are the most important period in Nigeria's polio eradication programme. Waning political support during the upcoming election season, insecurity and complacency are now the major risks to achieving success. Through continued programme progress during the upcoming election season, continued accountability, improvements in SIA quality, and access to children in insecure areas, Nigeria can achieve success in 2014. See 'Nigeria' section for more information.
- WHO published its updated vaccination recommendations for travelers from polio-infected countries in its publication International Travel and Health (polio-related section on pages 33-35). These updates were endorsed at last month's [March 2013] meeting of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE). Polio vaccination recommendations for travelers from polio-infected countries should apply to all residents and visitors of all ages, who spend more than 4 weeks in the country. Resident travelers from polio-infected countries should have received one documented additional dose of OPV or IPV a minimum of 4 weeks and a maximum of 12 months before each international travel. Travelers embarking on last minute/urgent travel that cannot be postponed should receive one dose of OPV or IPV before departure if they have not received a documented dose of polio vaccine within the past 12 months.
- One new cVDPV2 case has been reported in the past week from Africa. The case is currently under cross border investigation to determine country of onset (Nigeria or Cameroon).

Afghanistan
-----------
- No new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week. The most recent WPV1 case had onset of paralysis on [25 Feb 2014], from Muhmand Dara district in Nangarhar province, Eastern Region. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2014 is 3, and 14 for 2013.
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2013 remains 3, with the most recent cVDPV2 case in March 2013 from Kandahar province, Southern Region.
- Nationwide supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) using bivalent OPV were held this week ([20-29 Apr 2014]), with further campaigns in high-risk areas planned for May [2014].

Nigeria
-------
- One new WPV1 case was reported this week from Kano with onset of paralysis on [24 Mar 2014] bringing the total number of WPV1 cases for 2014 to 2 (both in Kano). The total number of WPV1 cases for 2013 is 53.
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2014 is one, and for 2013 is 4. The most recent cVDPV case had onset of paralysis on [9 Feb 2014] (from Damboa, Borno).
- Meeting last week [23-24 Apr 2014] in Abuja, the ERC concluded that as a result of significant programme improvements, a window of opportunity for eradicating polio exists between May and December 2014.
- In particular, the ERC noted the significant decline in wild poliovirus (WPV) cases, with only 1 WPV case reported this year (compared to 13 for the same period in 2013). WPV type 3 has not been detected in more than 17 months (since November 2012). The genetic biodiversity of transmission has been reduced to one remaining endemic cluster.
- This reduction in cases is associated with a significant increase in the quality of supplementary immunization activities (SIAs), monitored through Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS). Almost 90 percent of Local Government Areas (LGAs) in the 11 high-risk states achieved coverage of at least 80 percent during the recent IPDs. This compares to less than 65 percent of LGAs in these same states achieving the same level of coverage just 12 months ago.
- In virtually all high-risk states (except Borno), overall population immunity to type 1 polio has now increased to more than 80 percent, though sub-state gaps remain, in particular in key areas of Borno, Kano, and Yobe. The proportion of under-vaccinated children (less than 3 doses) in high-risk states has been reduced to less than 5 percent.
- Waning political support during the upcoming election season [national elections will take place in February 2015], insecurity, and complacency are now the major risks to achieving success.
- SIA improvements must be sustained consistently, from campaign to campaign.
- Specific plans should be developed to ensure the support of the Presidency, state governors, Local Government Area (LGA) Chairpersons, and traditional leaders.
- National and state Emergency Operations Centres (EOS) must be maintained.
- Special strategies for insecure areas must be fully implemented, including:
- Permanent vaccination posts at major transit posts
- Special campaigns to reach internally-displaced persons
- Using lessons learned from other high-risk states, including improving the quality of operations in accessible areas of Borno and Yobe
- Strengthened cross-border coordination should be implemented, given prolonged circulation of WPVs and circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) in neighbouring countries and areas.
- The SIA schedule will now be optimized, to ensure rapid eradication of both WPV1 and cVDPV type 2, and subnational surveillance further strengthened.
- All states will develop and maintain emergency preparedness and response plans for polio, enabling state-wide and immediate mop-up campaigns for the detection of any new poliovirus.
- Through continued programme progress during the upcoming election season, continued accountability, improvements in SIA quality, and access to children in insecure areas, Nigeria can achieve success in 2014.
- The most recent nationwide Immunization Plus Days (IPDs) took place on [12-14 Apr 2014], using a combination of bivalent and trivalent OPV. Subnational IPDs in northern Nigeria are planned for May and June [2014].

Pakistan
--------
- 5 new WPV1 cases have been reported in the past week (from North Waziristan, South Waziristan, Federally Administered Tribal Areas-FATA, Gadap, greater Karachi, Sindh, and Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa-KP), bringing the total number of WPV1 cases for 2014 to 54. The most recent WPV1 case had onset of paralysis on [6 Apr 2014] (from North Waziristan).
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [2 Apr 2014] (from North Waziristan). The total number of cVDPV2 cases is 45 for 2013, and 10 for 2014.
- North Waziristan is the district with the largest number of children being paralyzed by poliovirus in the world (both wild and cVDPV2). Immunization activities have been suspended by local leaders since June 2012. It is critical that children in all areas are vaccinated and protected from poliovirus. Immunizations in neighboring high-risk areas are being intensified, to further boost population immunity levels in those areas and prevent further spread of this outbreak.
- The densely populated Peshawar valley is considered to be the main 'engine' of poliovirus transmission, alongside North Waziristan, due to large-scale population movements through Peshawar from across this region, and into other areas of Pakistan. The quality of operations must be urgently improved in Peshawar, and immunization activities urgently resumed in North Waziristan.
- The only WPV1 cases reported outside FATA/KP in 2014 are from the greater Karachi area, where vaccination coverage gaps remain.

Central Africa
------------
- In Equatorial Guinea, no new WPV1 case was reported this week. The total number of WPV1 cases reported from Equatorial Guinea for 2014 is 3. NIDs took place last week, with further campaigns planned for May [2014]. The cases are linked to an ongoing outbreak in neighbouring Cameroon.
- In Cameroon, an analysis of outbreak response conducted so far indicates overall quality has been insufficient to interrupt poliovirus transmission. Due to subnational surveillance gaps, further undetected transmission cannot be ruled out.
- Outbreak response continues to be affected by serious gaps in quality. Given the continuation and expansion of virus transmission, additional emergency outbreak response is being planned and implemented.
- Focus will be on improving the quality of supplementary immunization activities (SIAs), in preparation, implementation and monitoring. Microplans will be strengthened, including through conducting local-level micro planning workshops. Social mobilization activities are being scaled up and targeted. A new accountability framework mechanism will be developed to increase ownership at all levels. Independent monitoring will be systematically rolled out across the country.
- Urgent efforts are underway to rapidly improve the quality of surveillance so that the full extent of the outbreak can be determined and tracked. Focal points are designated at all notification sites, and active searches conducted. Clinician training will be re-instigated, and AFP case definition criteria re-disseminated across the network.
- On [17 Mar 2014], WHO elevated the risk assessment of international spread of polio from Cameroon to very high, due to continued and expanding virus circulation in the country, gaps in surveillance and influx of vulnerable refugee populations. Outbreak response is also being implemented in Equatorial Guinea, with emergency campaigns also conducted in Central African Republic, Gabon, and the Republic of Congo.

Horn of Africa
--------------
- No new 2014 WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent case in the region had onset of paralysis on [5 Jan 2014], from Somali region in Ethiopia. It is the only reported case in the Horn of Africa in 2014.
- The total number of WPV1 cases in the Horn of Africa is 219 since the beginning of the outbreak in April 2013 (194 from Somalia, 15 from Kenya, and 10 from Ethiopia).
- Outbreak response across the Horn of Africa is continuing. Recommendations from the recently held Horn of Africa Technical Advisory Group (TAG) are now actively being incorporated into outbreak response planning. The TAG had underscored that the initial response to the outbreak was appropriate, however expressed grave concern that gaps in SIA quality and surveillance remained in key infected areas of the region.
- In particular, the TAG expressed concern at critical quality gaps in implementation in key areas of Ethiopia. The group recommended that infected countries should focus efforts on high-risk and infected areas, by conducting high-quality SIAs no more than 4 weeks apart.

Israel and West Bank and Gaza
-----------------------------
- WPV1-positive samples have been detected by environmental surveillance in Israel since [3 Feb 2013] and continue to be detected in 2014 (13 positive samples collected this year [2014], the most recent of which was collected on [16 Mar 2014]; in 2013, 134 positive samples were collected).
- Since 2005, only inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) has been used for routine childhood immunization in Israel. To interrupt WPV1 transmission, a nationwide supplementary immunization activity (SIA) with bivalent OPV targeting children less than 10 years of age was conducted from August to October 2013.
- Following a consultation with the country's immunization advisory group, the Israeli Ministry of Health has decided to re-introduce OPV into the national routine immunization schedule. However, no additional supplementary campaigns with OPV are being planned.
- Positive environmental samples have also been detected in West Bank and Gaza Strip, the most recent positive sample was collected in the Gaza Strip during the week of [5 Jan 2014].
- SIAs in West Bank and Gaza Strip were conducted [8-15 Dec 2013] and [8-15 Jan 2014].

Middle East
-----------
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week from the Middle East. The most recent WPV1 case in the region was from northern Baghdad, Iraq, with onset of paralysis on [10 Feb 2014].
- The total number of WPV1 cases reported from the Middle East is 37. In Syria, 36 cases are reported (35 in 2013 and 1 in 2014) with the most recent date of onset of paralyses on [21 Jan 2014]. In Iraq, 1 case is reported with onset of paralysis on [10 Feb 2014] from northern Baghdad.
- WHO and UNICEF are committed to working with all organizations and agencies providing humanitarian assistance to Syrians affected by the conflict. This includes vaccination of all children no matter where they are, whether in government or contested areas, or outside Syria.
- In the Middle East, a comprehensive outbreak response continues to be implemented across the region. The WHO/UNICEF Strategic Plan for Polio Outbreak Response in the Middle East outlines the action plan for Syria and neighbouring countries in response to the circulation of wild poliovirus following importation.

West Africa
-----------
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent case in the region was due to WPV1 from Tahoua province in Niger with onset of paralysis on [15 Nov 2012].
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week from Niger. The country has reported a single case of cVDPV2 in 2013, with onset of paralysis on [11 Jul 2013]. Genetic sequencing has shown that the virus is related to that seen in Cameroon, Chad and Nigeria (Borno).
- Multi-country, synchronized campaigns were held on [25-28 Apr 2014] in Benin, Burkina Faso, and Niger, with further multi-country activities planned for May [2014].

[While there are a total of 7 more cases reported since the last Global Polio Eradication Initiative update was published (16 Apr 2014), there had been 4 cases reported from Afghanistan in the last post, one of which has been removed from the count; so in fact, there have been 8 newly confirmed cases in this interval -- 7 of them in Pakistan and one in Nigeria. The reports on the vaccination responses in Central Africa are disconcerting as results have been suboptimal for interruption of transmission of the WPV.
