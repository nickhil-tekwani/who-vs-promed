Asian Mosquito Poses Deadly Health Threat
-----------------------------------------
A nationwide search has been ordered at ports and used-tire depots for an
Asian mosquito that is posing a new health threat in Britain. The Asian
tiger mosquito, _Aedes albopictus_, has been found as close as Normandy and
is known to survive in Italy, Belgium, and Albania. Specialists suspect it
is already in Britain and that it will be able to survive because of
climate change. It is likely to have been brought into Britain in used
tires brought from the Far East for re-treading. The mosquito likes tires
because water collects in the treads, where it lays its eggs. Last year
Britain imported 12 million tyres from the Far East.
An agency spokesman said the mosquito was likely to be in Britain but it
was not known if it represented a risk. "There is no evidence that it has
transmitted diseases in France and Belgium. We need to check for its
presence and work out if it can survive here. If it can, we believe it is
likely to be an urban rather than a rural mosquito," he said.
The mosquito is known to carry 23 different arboviruses [arthropod-borne
viruses belonging predominantly to the families _Bunyaviridae_,
_Flaviviridae_, and _Togaviridae_], as well as a worm, the parasitic
_Dirofilarria_, which gets into the lungs and can cause severe lung damage.
