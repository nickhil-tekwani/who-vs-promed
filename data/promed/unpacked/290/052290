MALARIA, RESISTANT - VENEZUELA
==============================
Source: an extended article by Vanessa Davies in El Nacional; Caracas, 2 April
1997

Without much fanfare, the MSAS (Ministry of Health and Social Assistance)
reported that last year Venezuela had 34,467 cases of malaria. For this
year until 15 March, 9,856 cases were reported--an increase of 104.6% over
the same period of last year.
Although the reported number of malaria deaths is low (143 deaths of
patients over the age of 4, or 1-5%), it obscures the true number of
fatalities, according to Alexis Rodriguez, Director of the Institute of
Tropical Medicine (IMT) of the UCV (Central
University of Venezuela).
Lack of effective control has permitted a flourishing of mosquitos that has
been
enhanced by the prolongation of the rainy season. The malaria epidemic is
particularly grave in the states of Bolivar and Sucre where mosquitos are
endemic. In addition, malaria is extending toward Anzoategui, Guarico, Delta
Amacuro and the south of Monagas.
The _Anopheles_ mosquito is growing seemingly out of control, and another
species, _A. alimanus_ (which [was previously] nearly exterminated) has
returned. Also present are: _A. darlinghi_ in Bolivar, and _A.
nuneztovaris_ in Tachira and Barinas. _A. aquasalis_ has been introduced in
the state of Sucre by miners from neighboring states. (These are often
illegal precious metal mines in Amazonas.)
Results of research by Rodriguez and collaborators has shown that
_Plasmodium falciparum_, present in the state of Bolivar, is resistant in
20% of cases to
chloroquine and Fanzidar, medications offered by the National Health
Service. A surprise discovery by Rodriquez in the miners is the
introduction of illegal antimalarial drugs which are taken in insufficient
dosage to effect a cure, but on the contrary, promote the growth of
resistant strains. Healthcare coverage of the miners is often very poor,
characterized by irregular medical visits. Rodriguez emphasized the
requirement to deliver healthcare where it's needed.
