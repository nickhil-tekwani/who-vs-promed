Last Wednesday, 19 May 2010, 4 persons lost their lives following an
outbreak of cholera at Ibwa community in Gwagwalada Area Council of
the Federal Capital Territory. Council Chairman, Alhaji Zakari Angulu
Dobi, said 2 persons died on the 1st day of the outbreak of the
epidemic last week, while another 2 died the following day at the
community's health centre.

According to him, on receiving information on the outbreak, the
council authority immediately sent additional drugs to the affected
community in order to control the epidemic. He said the report he
received indicated that 118 people were affected by the epidemic,
including children, who were treated.

The council boss urged residents of the community to report cases of
such diseases on time rather than engage in self medication, adding
that the council will refurbish the community's bore-hole in order to
support the existing water sources.

[2] Cholera - Uganda (Tororo)

An outbreak of cholera following frequent floods in eastern Uganda
has left 6 people dead and dozens more admitted in hospital, local
authorities said on [Sat 22 May 2010].

"Since the outbreak of the deadly disease early this week, cholera
has now killed 6 people in 2 sub counties of Mulanda and Kirewa,"
Emmanuel Osuna, the district local council chairman told Xinhua on
the phone.

The outbreak in Tororo district, eastern Uganda, was a result of
recent flash floods that ravaged parts of the mountainous area
following torrential rains, local officials said.

"We have so far received about 50 cases in the main hospital. It has
forced the district authorities to set up reception centers that will
handle emergencies as the medics struggle to treat them amidst
scarcity of the drugs in the hospital," said Osuna.

The floods destroyed the latrine facilities, contaminating drinking
water and posing a grave health threat to the local communities.

The cholera epidemic in Moroto District has spread out to 40
villages, authorities have said. About 220 cases and 5 deaths have
reported since the outbreak was detected on 16 Apr 2010.

According to the World Health Organization's 'health action in
crisis' officer in charge, Mr Innocent Komakech, 20 to 25 cases of
cholera are diagnosed each day at the treatment unit in Moroto
District.

"About 48 patients are admitted in the wards. The treatment units are
congested and we are preparing to create new units across the
district," Mr Komakech told Saturday Monitor on [Thu 20 May 2010].

He said the sub-counties of Nadunget, Rupa, and North, East and South
divisions in Moroto municipality have been hit the hardest by the
outbreak.

"There a risk of the epidemic spreading out to other parts of
Karamoja region if not checked properly," he said.

Martin Eyura, the district health officer said, "Latrine coverage in
Moroto is still very low at 10 per cent with most of the latrines not
utilized.

[4] Diarrhea - Angola (Luanda)

During the 1st 4 months of the year [2010], 1101 cases of acute
diarrhea were treated at the Rangel Health Center, in the
municipality of the same name, in Luanda province, 100 more than
during the same period of 2009. According to Adelaide Auguste Paulo,
nurse supervisor of the Rangel Health Center, in January [2010], 268
people consulted the center, 400 in February, 184 in March, and 250
in April. In her opinion the picture is preoccupying, since 9 cases
are taken care of daily, but she hopes to see a reduction in the
number of cases because of the dry period, when there are no floods
or stagnant water accumulating on the streets.

She emphasized that the lack of the sanitation of the environment and
the lack of attention of some parents to the medical advice are the
base of the frequent epidemic. The municipality of Rangel has an
estimated population of 700 000 inhabitants distributed in the
communes of the Marcal, Nelito Soares, and Rangel.

Peth Lou, one of the local administrative units situated east of
Wanyjok, headquarters of Aweil East County, Northern Bahr el Ghazal

East of Madhol and west of Tokyep village from where 10 people mostly
children are reportedly caught by watery diarrhea.

people before its confirmation by the local ministry of health.

week with records showing that 12 suspected patients were admitted at

[6] Cholera - Kenya (Rift Valley, Coast)
Date: Mon 10 May 2010

A fast-spreading outbreak of cholera has killed at least 10 people in
West Pokot [Rift Valley province] and Kilifi [Coast province]
districts, in what the government said on 10 May 2010 was the worst
epidemic since the onset of the current rains.

Public Health Minister Beth Mugo confirmed that 8 people had died in
West Pokot and that her ministry had dispatched officers to
flood-prone regions to sensitize residents on ways to prevent the
scourge.

Elsewhere, 2 children from Matsangoni village, Kilifi are feared to
have died of the water-borne disease while 4 people had been admitted
to health centers there.

"For almost a year, we have not had any cholera outbreak in Kisumu,
Nyanza which is the traditional area of cholera. That shows that we
are really controlling the disease," Mrs Mugo observed.

In 2009, Kenya faced one of the worst cholera outbreaks in a decade
and at least 122 people died as a result of the epidemic sweeping
across the country. A total of 10 940 cases were reported from the
outbreak, which began in December 2008.
