Although you've provisionally closed this string, here is some additional
information that may still be of interest:
1. The northwestern U.S. hamburger outbreak in 1994 was traced back to
collateral lots of beef which carried E. coli O157:H7 cfus/g of 1/g,
suggesting an infectious dose possibility of fewer than 100 organisms in a
burger. However, no recovery was made from actual product eaten.
2. The San Francisco salami outbreak in 1995 was traced back to remaining
finished product samples with counts so low that compositing five 25g
[samples to give a single 125g sample gave negative results, but individual
samples showed positive results. This resulted in USDA requiring a larger
sample size detection limit for dry sausage (125g vs. 25g. in burgers).
This also suggested the possibility of an infectious dose as low as 10
organisms. Again, however, these results were from collateral samples,
although this time from the same lot.
3. Challenge studies in infant pigs show 1,000 organisms generates consistent
infections, so this appears to be a firm upper limit on the lowest infectious
dose. [Perhaps we need an Infectious Dose 50? -- Mod CHC
4. All reported EHEC pathogenic strains of E. coli are among the most acid
tolerant, consequently little destruction occurs in the stomach. Also note
US and Australian outbreaks in low pH (4.6-5.0) dry sausage.
Consequently, it currently seems the infectious dose for E. coli O157:H7 is
below 1,000 cfu, and may be as low as 10-100 cfu.
