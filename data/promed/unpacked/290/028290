[From a previous post: From the time that state officials believe the cows
were exposed to the poison until the dairy was shut down on Monday, about
18,000 gallons of milk were shipped from the dairy to processing
facilities, Hidalgo said.
That milk was processed into about 700,000 pounds of butter and 3 million
pounds of dried milk.
The 18K (18 thousand) gallons of milk only weigh about 144K (144 thousand)
pounds but the output product is reported to be 3.7 million pounds. Perhaps
the volume of milk should have been 18 million gallons, but how does that
square with the size of the herd in question?

The 18,000 gallons of contaminated milk referred to in part [2 of this
posting is roughly 150,000 pounds. The possibility of this yielding
"700,000 pounds of butter and 3 million pounds of dried milk" is
preposterous. Someone at the Modesto Bee must have slipped a few decimal
places.

milk would inform us. - Mod.TG
