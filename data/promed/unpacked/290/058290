On 12 Aug [2020], health officials reported a Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) case in Senegal. The case was detected as part of the epidemiological surveillance system in the country. The patient is a 27-year-old woman living in the Pikine district in Dakar.

At the time of diagnosis, she presented with a fever with hemorrhagic signs (gingivorrhagia [bleeding from the gums], metrorrhagia [irregular uterine bleeding]). Investigations by a multidisciplinary team are ongoing to document this outbreak.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is a widespread disease caused by a tick-borne virus (_Orthonairovirus_) of the Nairoviridae family. The CCHF virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40%.

Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks, and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites. Although a number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_ are the principal vector.

The CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Human-to-human transmission is possible.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne disease caused by the arbovirus Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), which is a member of the _Nairovirus_ genus (family Bunyaviridae). CCHF was first recognized during a large outbreak among agricultural workers in the mid-1940s on the Crimean Peninsula. After a short incubation period, CCHF is characterized by a sudden onset of high fever, chills, severe headache, dizziness, and back and abdominal pains. Additional symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and neuropsychiatric and cardiovascular changes. In severe cases, hemorrhagic manifestations, ranging from petechiae [tiny red or purple spots due to bleeding under the skin] to large areas of ecchymosis [bruising], develop.

Numerous genera of Ixodid ticks serve both as vector and reservoir for CCHFV; however, ticks in the genus _Hyalomma_ are particularly important to the ecology of this virus. In fact, occurrence of CCHF closely approximates the known world distribution of _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks.

The disease now occurs sporadically throughout much of Africa, Asia, and Europe and results in an approximately 30% fatality rate. Previous seroprevalence studies have highlighted that CCHF is focally endemic throughout Senegal and neighboring countries.

Sporadic human infections may be expected in people with regular contact with livestock in endemic areas, but these are preventable through use of repellents, protective clothing, and gloves to prevent tick bites, and by avoiding contact with blood and body fluids of livestock.

To prevent outbreaks of CCHF, public awareness campaigns aimed at the populations most at risk -- livestock farmers, butchers, and health personnel -- must be conducted, and the epidemiologic alert systems must be strengthened. In addition, conditions that enhance maintenance of the virus in nature and its transmission to humans must be better understood so adequate control measures can be developed. - Mod.UBA
