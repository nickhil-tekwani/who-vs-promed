Uige
----
The internment of cases linked with cholera, in the provincial
hospital of Uije, dropped over the last days from 20 to 15 cases per
day, the hospital director Oscar Paulo has told Angop.
The official has attributed the reduction of the cases in the local
hospital to fact the residents stick to the preventive measures,
advised and supervised by health services. The constant rains in the
region mainly account for the spread of cholera across the northern province.
Huambo
------
The cholera outbreak that has already caused 25 deaths out of the 269
recorded cases, continues to spread in the peripheral quarters of Huambo City.
The spokesman of the provincial health board, Issac Kassenge, said
that during the last 48 hours new cases were recorded in the
localities of Canhe, Canata, Camussamba, Bom Pastor, Calundo Chiva and Benfica.
This recent outbreak has mostly killed adults.

An IRC emergency team is responding to a serious outbreak of cholera
in DR Congo. Over the past 2 months the 7-person team has provided
almost 4000 liters of cholera treatment drugs, 3000 sacks of oral
re-hydration salts and over 40 treatment beds to affected people in
South Kivu province. The team also installed 3 fresh water containers
of 10 000 liters at the Bukavu provincial hospital and the Panzi
hospital in South Kivu. Other equipment, including buckets, blankets
and gloves were provided to hospitals and other responding agencies.
"Reported new cases have almost doubled over the past few weeks,
rising from 315 during the last week of November 2006 to over 800
during the first week of December 2006," said Christopher Rae,
program coordinator for the response team.
The outbreak is being attributed mainly to the lack of potable water
in the region. During the rainy season, filth and waste from
unsecured latrines is often washed into unprotected water sources,
severely contaminating the water used by local residents.

A cholera epidemic in Niger which broke out in September 2006 has
claimed 79 lives and about 1200 cases have been reported in the
country, the health ministry said on Sun, 24 Dec 2006.
The West African country's 2 biggest cities, Zinder & Maradi, as well
as Diffa in the southeast, have been the most affected by the
epidemic. Heavy rain had triggered major flooding in the region of
the cholera outbreak, where sanitary conditions are precarious.
The flood affected more than 43 000 people and left about 10 000
homeless, according to the UN. The WHO sent medical teams and
medications to fight the cholera outbreak.

The number of Fremont County residents diagnosed with shigellosis has
increased to 78 and state health officials are emphasizing the need
for prevention. The current outbreak has particularly affected
preschool and elementary school children. At least 16 children have
been hospitalized in recent months, the Wyoming Department of Health reports.
"The size and duration of this outbreak are rare for our state," said
Kelly Weidenbach, surveillance epidemiologist with the health department.
Dr. Tracy Murphy, state epidemiologist at the Wyoming Department of
Health, said that if prevention measures aren't followed, the
outbreak will continue to spread.
"Shigellosis is very easy to spread to others, and people with
diarrhea should stay home until the diarrhea has completely stopped
so that they do not transmit the infection," Murphy said. "It is
especially important for parents to keep children who are sick home
from school or day care."
