Adamantane Resistance Observed in Current H3N2 Influenza Viruses
-----------------------------------------------
With the flu season reaching its peak, 2 drugs typically prescribed
to fight the virus will be ineffective this season and should not be
prescribed, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced
on Sat 14 Jan 2006. The CDC found in tests that the antiviral drugs
adamantadine and rimantadine were ineffective 91 percent of the time
against H3N2 influenza, the dominant strain this season. However, 2
other antiviral drugs, Tamiflu and Relenza are still effective, said
CDC Director Dr. Julie Gerberding. Amantadine and rimantadine are
older, less-expensive and less commonly prescribed drugs.
There has been a global trend toward drug resistance, but Gerberding
said health officials didn't expect the resistance "to be quite as
dramatic so soon." "We don't know exactly why resistance has risen to
these drugs," Gerberding said, adding that the [H3N2] influenza virus
may have mutated, but there is no evidence to support that. "Flu
constantly evolves, and we are always one mutation away from drug
resistance." There is no "magic bullet" to prevent drugs from
becoming ineffective against certain flu strains, she said.
There is plenty of Tamiflu and Relenza for this flu season, because
the CDC stockpiled the drugs in case of an influenza pandemic, Gerberding said.
[Seasonal] influenza is widespread in Arizona, Texas, New Mexico,
Nevada, California, Oregon and Colorado. The season, which can begin
as early as October and stretch into May, typically is most
widespread in December, January and February.

2 Common Flu Drugs Ineffective Against Current H3N2 Virus
-----------------------------------------------
Federal health officials yesterday [14 Jan 2006] advised physicians
not to use 2 common and long-standing influenza drugs, because nearly
all the virus in current flu outbreaks in the United States is
resistant to them. The elimination of amantadine and rimantadine from
clinical use leaves practitioners with only 2 licensed influenza
antivirals, Tamiflu and Relenza. Relenza is largely unavailable,
however, because of supply shortages.
Resistance to amantadine and rimantadine has been climbing,
particularly in Asia, in recent years. It has taken a huge leap this
year [2006] in the United States for reasons that are unclear. 2
years ago, 2 percent of circulating flu viruses here were resistant
to the 2 drugs, which are known as adamantanes. Last flu season, 11
percent were resistant. This season, 91 percent of virus samples
tested since 1 Oct 2005 -- 109 out of 120 -- are
adamantane-resistant, said Nancy J. Cox, head of the influenza branch
at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The CDC made the announcement yesterday [14 Jan 2006] in an
urgently-called news conference. Flu season is heating up, and
outbreaks have been reported in nursing homes in New York, Illinois
and several other states. The adamantane drugs are commonly
prescribed to prevent infection in elderly or chronically ill people
at high risk for complications from the infection, including death.
"We really wanted to let clinicians know so they could treat their
patients appropriately," Cox said.
In the 1st week in January [2006], 7 states reported "widespread" flu
activity; 11 reported "regional;" 9, including Virginia, reported
"local;" 21 states, including Maryland (plus the District [of
Columbia]), reported "sporadic;" and 2 reported none. "These drugs
were the mainstay of influenza therapy," said Anne Moscona, a
pediatrician at Weill Cornell Medical Center and an expert in
antiviral drugs. She said the demise of amantadine and rimantadine is
not entirely unexpected. "The evolution of virus in this direction
has been inevitable. I think 91 percent resistant is probably a
higher level than was anticipated," she said. Adamantane resistance
is also rising in Europe, although flu-surveillance labs there have
not released their figures, Cox said. In Asia, resistance increased
from 2 percent in 2001 to 27 percent in 2004, with some countries
reporting much higher rates. In China's last flu season [2004-2005],
74 percent of virus samples were resistant to the adamantanes.
There are 2 ways drug resistance can increase rapidly. Flu virus can
undergo a spontaneous mutation that makes it resistant to a drug.
There are 5 places in the influenza virus genome where the
substitution of a single nucleotide or "letter" can confer resistance
to both adamantane drugs. This resistant strain can then, purely by
chance, become the dominant one during a flu season.
Alternatively, using an antiviral drug during an infection --
particularly if the dose is inadequate -- can put evolutionary
"pressure" on a virus to develop resistance. About 30 percent of
people who take amantadine once they are infected with influenza will
end up excreting drug-resistant virus from their throats, Moscona said.
Which of these mechanisms was responsible for the jump in adamantane
resistance is uncertain. In recent years, however, drug-resistant
strains have been found widely throughout China, even where
antivirals are rarely used, suggesting that chance may be an important factor.
The season's dominant strain of flu virus eventually disappears as it
runs out of victims; it is replaced by a new strain. Consequently, it
is possible that some future flu strains may be once again
susceptible to the drugs. The new development makes it even more
imperative that people who are prescribed Tamiflu (also known as
oseltamivir) take it at the right dose for a full course, Moscona said.

CDC Health Alert
------------
CDC Recommends against the Use of Amantadine and Rimandatine for the
Treatment or Prophylaxis of Influenza in the United States during the
2005-06 Influenza Season
-----------------------------------------------
Recent evidence indicates that a high proportion of currently
circulating Influenza A viruses in the USA are resistant to these medications
While the primary strategy for preventing complications of influenza
infections is annual vaccination, antiviral medications with activity
against influenza viruses can be effective for the prophylaxis and
treatment of influenza. 2 classes of antivirals are currently
available: the M2 ion channel inhibitors (i.e., the 2 adamantanes
amantadine and rimantadine) and the neuraminidase inhibitors (i.e.,
oseltamivir and zanamivir). The neuraminidase inhibitors are
effective for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A and B,
while the adamantanes are only active against influenza A viruses.
This alert provides new information about the resistance of influenza
viruses currently circulating in the United States to the
adamantanes, and it makes an interim recommendation that these drugs
not be used during the 2005-06 influenza season. Amantadine is also
used to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and should continue
to be used for this indication.
Viral resistance to adamantanes can emerge rapidly during treatment,
because a single point mutation at amino acid positions 26, 27, 30,
31, or 34 of the M2 protein can confer cross-resistance to both
amantadine and rimantadine. The transmissibility of
adamantane-resistant viruses is not impaired by any of these amino
acid changes. A recent report on the global prevalence of
adamantane-resistant influenza viruses showed a significant increase
(from 1.9 percent to 12.3 percent) in drug resistance over the past 3
years. In the United States, the frequency of drug resistance
increased from 1.9 percent in 2004 to 14.5 percent during the 1st 6
months of the 2004-05 influenza season.
For the 2005-06 season, 120 influenza A (H3N2) viruses isolated from
patients in 23 states have been tested at CDC through 12 Jan 2006;
109 of the isolates (91 percent) contain an amino acid change at
position 31 of the M2 protein, which confers resistance to amantadine
and rimantadine. 3 influenza A(H1N1) viruses have been tested and
have demonstrated susceptibility to these drugs. All influenza
viruses from the United States that have been screened for antiviral
resistance at CDC have demonstrated susceptibility to the
neuraminidase inhibitors.
On the basis of available antiviral testing results, CDC is providing
an interim recommendation that neither amantadine nor rimandatine be
used for the treatment or prophylaxis of influenza A in the United
States for the remainder of the 2005-06 influenza season. During this
period, oseltamivir or zanamivir should be selected if an antiviral
medication is used for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza.
Testing of influenza isolates for resistance to antivirals will
continue throughout the 2005-06 influenza season, and recommendations
will be updated as needed. Annual influenza vaccination remains the
primary means of preventing morbidity and mortality associated with influenza.
Additional information about the prevention and control of influenza
is available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/flu>.
Specific information regarding the use of the neuraminidase
inhibitors is available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/antiviral>.
These websites will be updated as new information becomes available.

[It should be noted that these observations and advice relate to the
human influenza A and B viruses circulating in the northern
hemisphere responsible for seasonal outbreaks of influenza in the
human population. They do not apply to the H5N1 avian influenza virus
responsible for the current outbreak of avian influenza in Eurasia.
The gene sequence of 2 isolates of avian H5N1 influenza virus
obtained from human victims, determined recently at the NIMR Mill
Hill, London, indicated that these viruses are sensitive to both the
neuraminidase inhibitors (Tamiflu and Relenza) and the M2 ion channel
inhibitors amantadine and rimantadine. - Mod.CP]
