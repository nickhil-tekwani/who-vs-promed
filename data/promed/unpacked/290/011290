South Sudan finds no sign of feared [ebolavirus infection] outbreak
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Health officials said they had found no evidence to back up reports
of a suspected outbreak of the deadly Ebola haemorrhagic fever in
south Sudan, suggesting locals may have made it up to draw doctors to
the underdeveloped area.

South Sudan's army this month [October 2009] said 20 soldiers and 3
of their wives had died of a haemorrhagic illness feared to be [an
ebolavirus infection] in barracks in the remote Western Bahr
al-Ghazal region, news that sparked widespread concern in the territory.

The south's health ministry told Reuters on Wednesday [21 Oct 2009]
it had since visited the area and found no signs of the disease. "Our
team went there and they did not find any cases ... They did not find
any deaths as was reported ... They concluded there was no Ebola
haemorrhagic fever outbreak," said Atem Nathan the ministry official
charged with investigating the outbreak. Nathan said that the reports
were likely a cry for help for more medical care by people living in
the war-ravaged area. "It is the lack of services that turns into
these rumours," he said, adding that during the Sudan's long
north-south civil war, communities sometimes made up outbreaks to
attract humanitarian assistance to their areas.

South Sudan's army said the director of its medical corps had also
visited the barracks and reached the same conclusion. "It seems that
the report by both the local county administration and the SPLA (the
southern Sudan People's Liberation Army) command about the deaths of
the 23 soldiers [that is, 20 soldiers and 3 of their wives] was
something to draw attention to the acute lack of medicine in Raja
County," said SPLA spokesman Kuol Diem Kuol. "They have succeeded.
Now medicines are being taken there." South Sudan ended a 2-decade
civil war with the north in 2005, but still has little health
infrastructure and few medical staff.

The World Health Organisation says Ebola haemorrhagic fever, one of
the most virulent viral diseases known to mankind, was discovered in
south Sudan and the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo in
1976. Some strains have a death rate of 25 to 90 percent. A 2004
outbreak of [ebolavirus infection] killed 7 people in the south.
Health officials say there is still no known cure for the disease,
which is spread through bodily fluids, including blood.

[The news that Ebola haemorrhagic fever has not reappeared in Sudan
is welcome, and the initiative of the local population in using the
rumour to improve their circumstances is a satisfactory outcome.
