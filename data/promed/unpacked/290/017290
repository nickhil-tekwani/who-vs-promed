Mysterious yellow canopy syndrome spreads further south
-------------------------------------------------------
A mysterious sugar cane syndrome has spread further south in Queensland. Yellow canopy syndrome (YCS) has a serious impact on sugar cane yields.

Sugar Research Australia (SRA) has discovered symptoms in a sugar cane crop near Maryborough [around 250 km (155 mi) north of Brisbane], which are similar to the same yellowing seen in crops in northern sugar cane growing areas. The disease was first observed in Far North Queensland.

SRA, industry representatives and growers met to discuss the outbreak and establish a wider monitoring program in the area. Dr Frikkie Botha, SRA, said there was no need for farmers to panic. "This is disappointing news for the local industry, but it is not unexpected," he said.

YCS is extremely unpredictable; sometimes the crop recovers with minimal impact, while in other paddocks YCS can become a recurring problem. It is proving to be a frustrating challenge for the researchers working to pinpoint its cause.

"We have not yet identified any biological agent," Dr Botha said. "We've screened extensively for bacteria and fungi. We have tried to screen for some viruses, but that's certainly now the focus." Researchers have previously ruled out transmission by insects and plant stress may be a contributing factor.

While other diseases can show similar symptoms, YCS is not seen anywhere else in the world.

[Yellow canopy syndrome (YCS) of sugarcane is only reported from Queensland and does not resemble any known diseases of the crop. It appears to spread southwards, but its means of transmission are unknown. Next to cane fields, similar symptoms have also been observed in grasses, which are therefore suspected as potential disease reservoirs. Transport restrictions on the movement of cane between districts have been introduced in an attempt to limit the spread of YCS, and some cane varieties have been reported to be more susceptible than others.

Research to find a possible cause is ongoing in Australia. So far, herbicides, insects, nutrient deficiency, or toxicity, as well as known viral, bacterial, or fungal diseases have been largely eliminated from further consideration. YCS can be induced experimentally in healthy plants and an infectious cause is considered likely, but environmental stress has not been ruled out as a potential contributing or triggering factor. Accurate diagnosis of a cause will be essential for providing control strategies.

YCS has started to impact cane productivity in Queensland, but it is difficult to estimate its rate of spread and potential economic impact in the longer term.
