France reported 4 new cases of mad cow disease, including the first detected
under a testing scheme for all cattle aged over 30 months destined for the
food chain. The first case found by the testing program, which the French
Government launched earlier this month, involved an animal born in 1995 in
the Ain region of eastern France. The findings brought to 10 the total
number of cases of mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy,
found this year in France. A total of 162 cases were found in 2000.

Mad Cow Crisis Has Asia Within Its Reach
----------------------------------------------
LONDON: Indonesia, Thailand, Taiwan and Sri Lanka may become the next
victims of mad cow disease after buying potentially tainted animal feed from
Britain at the height of the UK epidemic, scientists said on Wed 24 Jan
2001. Britain, which banned the feeding of crushed animal carcasses to
cattle in 1986, exported much of its stocks of feed to Europe and beyond
until a decade later, when the trade was ended.
Scientists suspect the use of meat and bone meal in feed has spread BSE, and
so UK export data may hold a key to which countries are threatened by it.
"The countries that stick out because they were importing animal feed at the
height of our [UK epidemic in the 1990s are Indonesia, India, Thailand,
Taiwan and Sri Lanka," said scientist Iain McGill, who worked at Britain's
farm ministry at the height of the BSE crisis.
McGill noted that other EU countries hit by BSE had also exported meal and
bone meal. Indonesia started importing general feedstuffs from Britain in
1991, with the largest consignment of over 20 060 tons in 1993, compared
with less than 6 tons into badly-hit Germany that year, UK customs data
showed. Thailand, Taiwan and Sri Lanka imported lesser tonnages, but the
quantities increased in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
Scientists said the spread of the disease depended on how much meat and bone
meal was included in animal feed, and how much was fed to cattle -- but the
figures did show the potential reach of BSE. "You would expect the first
cases (in Asian countries) within 3 or 4 years but it really depends on how
much they are recycling on their own," McGill said, referring to the
practice of using domestic cattle carcasses in feed. "If they are recycling
either within a species or between species ... then you might expect a peak
round about now or in the next few years -- and that depends on looking for
it."
For the United States, the risk from European feed is low, but the country's
beef industry may not be safe, McGill said. "The United States imported just
under 20 000 kg [a mere 20 tons (of UK feed) in 1989 when the epidemic
started to get going but was not at its peak, so there would be a pretty low
risk," he said. But circumstantial evidence suggested that a similar disease
in US mink might have been caused on farms where they had been fed cattle
remains. "They were recycling ... so if they had an undetected case of the
disease ... they could be more exposed from their own 'BSE' rather than from
Europe."

Illegal Trade Could Let "Mad Cow" Disease Into Russia
------------------------------------------------------
MOSCOW: Russia faces a threat posed by the illegal import of meat possibly
contaminated with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), Deputy Health
Minister Gennady Onishchenko said Thursday. His warning came after
veterinary authorities seized a 2-ton cargo of French beef suspected of
having been contaminated and illegally imported via eastern Russia. The
seizure happened in the far eastern city of Magadan, RIA Novosti reported.
Although officials had not yet detected any instance of BSE in Russia, there
was a serious danger from "the criminal import of meat in regions
contaminated by false export certificates," said Onishchenko. Mikhail
Kravtsov, the head of the agriculture ministry's veterinary department, told
journalists that beef imports were "systematically controlled at the borders
by veterinary and customs officers."
Russia has banned the import of beef from Britain, several parts of France
and other European countries. The import of all but fish-based animal feed
for livestock had also been banned, while the use of home-grown equivalents
has been outlawed since 1990, he added.
Kravtsov said that one side-effect of the financial crisis the industry had
suffered since the Soviet era had been to eliminate one of the key sources
of BSE from Russia's food chain. "We didn't have the money to buy the
animal-feed products, and our poverty was fortunate, because as a result we
do not have BSE," he added. The only Russian laboratory equipped to detect
cases of BSE had been set up in Vladimir, southeast of Moscow, in 1998.
Russia has already banned beef imports from Britain and Portugal, as well as
from certain parts of France and Ireland.

Portugal, Spain, Italy & Belgium
---------------------------------------
LISBON, Portugal: Slaughterhouses across Portugal began killing the first of
50 000 cattle Thursday in an effort to purge herds of BSE. Hoping to keep
infected beef from entering the food chain and to reassure jittery
consumers, Portuguese officials ordered the slaughter of cattle older than
30 months at a rate of 3000 a week.
Meanwhile, in Spain, where beef sales have plummeted by a third since the
first case of BSE was announced in November 2000, according to the
Agriculture Ministry, 2 more cows were diagnosed with the disease Thursday.
Spain's total is now 9.
In Italy, farmers took to the streets Thursday to demand more government aid
after a second suspected case of BSE turned up.
Belgian authorities also reported the country's third case of mad cow
disease.
