On 16 Aug 2012, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) was notified of 2 patients at a Denver metropolitan area acute-care hospital who had positive respiratory cultures for carbapenem-resistant _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ during July-August 2012. PCR [polymerase chain reaction] testing performed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified these organisms as producing the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM) enzyme, the 1st identified in Colorado. A 3rd patient with NDM-producing carbapenem-resistant _K. pneumoniae_, admitted to the same hospital in May 2012, was identified through review of microbiology records.

The hospital has performed multiple rounds of surveillance rectal cultures for CRE [carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae] in units where case-patients had been located. One round of surveillance cultures, performed on 26 Sep 2012, identified 5 additional patients colonized with the NDM-producing _K. pneumoniae_, for a total of 8 case-patients identified in 5 separate units. No new case-patients have been identified since 26 Sep 2012, despite multiple point prevalence surveys in affected units. It is unclear at this time how this organism was introduced into the facility.

Case patients had been cared for at several other health-care facilities in Colorado before and after their positive cultures. Point prevalence surveillance cultures were recommended for patients at 2 other facilities: a rehabilitation unit in an acute-care hospital, and a long-term acute-care hospital, that received patients with the NDM-producing organism from the affected acute-care hospital. A collaborative investigation between the involved hospital, local public health agencies, CDPHE, and CDC is ongoing.

[ProMED-mail was 1st alerted to this outbreak of carbapenem-resistant (NDM) _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ at a Denver metropolitan area hospital by Valerie Sloniker (<sloniker@vvmc.com>). In personal communication, Dr Bamberg says that the klebsiella isolates are highly related by genetic testing. Environmental cultures performed did not yield the outbreak organism. The investigation is still ongoing, but for now, it is still unclear how the organism was introduced into or subsequently spread within the hospital.

Since the 1st report in 2009 (Yong D, Toleman MA, Giske CG, et al. Characterization of a new metallo-beta-lactamase gene, _bla_NDM-1, and a novel erythromycin esterase gene carried on a unique genetic structure in Klebsiella pneumoniae sequence type 14 from India. Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2009;53:5046-54), cases involving NDM-producing Enterobacteriaceae have been reported worldwide. CDC reported that New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase NDM-1 was 1st detected in the United States in 2010
(http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5924a5.htm) in 3 patients who received recent medical care in India. The gene that encodes this beta-lactamase (_bla_NDM-1) was found in _Escherichia coli_, _Klebsiella pneumoniae_, and _Enterobacter cloacae_. _Bla_NDM-1 confers resistance to all beta-lactam agents except aztreonam (a monobactam antimicrobial); but these 3 isolates, as has been the pattern frequently, were aztreonam resistant, presumably by a different mechanism. The _bla_NDM gene is usually linked to other genes that confer resistance to multiple other classes of antibiotics so that NDM-positive isolates are usually susceptible only to tigecycline, colistin, and polymyxin B.

In June 2012, CDC reported that a total of 13 cases of NDM had been reported in the United States (Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae Containing New Delhi Metallo-Beta-Lactamase in Two Patients -- Rhode Island, March 2012 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) June 22, 2012 / 61(24);446-448. Available at:
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6124a3.htm?s_cid=mm6124a3_e). _Bla_NDM is carried on a plasmid, a mobile genetic element, which facilitates its spread to other Enterobacteriaceae and other genera of bacteria. Bacteria carrying _bla_NDM can colonize the gastrointestinal systems of humans for prolonged periods and once introduced can spread through contamination of water sources, hands of health care personnel, and environmental surfaces (fpr example bed rails, IV poles, computer touchpads, and equipment used to monitor vital signs such as stethoscopes, blood pressure cuffs, etc.) within health care facilities (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6124a3.htm?s_cid=mm6124a3_e).

Infection control interventions aimed at preventing transmission of carbapenemase-producing isolates include recognition of carbapenem-resistant _Enterobacteriaceae_ when cultured from clinical specimens, placement of patients colonized or infected with these isolates on contact precautions, including the use of dedicated devices for monitoring vital signs, assurance of high rates of hand hygiene compliance, minimizing the use of invasive devices, limiting unnecessary antibiotic exposure among hospitalized patients, and, if NDM is identified, conducting point prevalence surveys or active-surveillance testing among patients on the affected hospital or skilled nursing facility units to identify patients carrying carbapenemase-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CDC. Guidance for control of infections with carbapenem-resistant or carbapenemase-producing _Enterobacteriaceae_ in acute care facilities. MMWR 2009; 58: 256-60. Available at:
