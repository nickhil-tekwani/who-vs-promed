Summer hasn't even started, but tickborne illnesses are already causing problems in Middle Tennessee. Local pets are getting sick due to cytauxzoonosis, a disease spread by ticks.

Experts say the disease starts in bobcats, who pass it to ticks, and they then spread it to domestic cats. It is often in fatal in cats, and at least one Bellevue family's cat recently died from the disease. Veterinarians recommend that you watch your cats carefully.

"If your cat seems lethargic or feels warm, then you can't get it to a veterinarian early enough, because, certainly with this disease, the earlier the intervention, hopefully, the better the outcome may be," said veterinarian Dr Marc Bercovitch.

Veterinarians say the best way to keep your cats safe is to keep them indoors at all times and regularly check for ticks.

[Cytauxzoonosis, caused by _Cytauxzoon felis_, was 1st reported in the USA in 1976; since then, it has become an important emerging infectious disease in domestic cats. _Cytauxzoon_ species are protozoan parasites classified within the family Theileriidae, along with _Theileria_ spp and _Gonderia_ spp. More recent molecular characterizations of these organisms have resulted in some dispute about the taxonomic status of _Cytauxzoon_ spp, but its multiplication by schizogony in mononuclear phagocytes (macrophages), rather than lymphocytes as for _Theileria_ spp, is a strong argument for maintaining its classification in a separate genus.

The domestic cat has been considered an aberrant or dead-end host given the acute and fatal course of disease; however, there are reports of domestic cats surviving natural infection with and without treatment. The bobcat (_Lynx rufus_) is the natural host, typically experiencing subclinical infection and maintaining chronic parasitemia. _C. felis_ infection has been reported in several other wild felids, such as cougars and panthers, in the absence of overt disease; however, a few lions and tigers have been reported to succumb to illness.

Recent studies demonstrated that _C. felis_ can be transmitted by the lone star tick, _Amblyomma americanum_. The distribution of this tick parallels the distribution of cytauxzoonosis in domestic cats much more closely than does the distribution of the other competent vector, the American dog tick, _Dermacentor variabilis_. Cytauxzoonosis is typically diagnosed during April through September, which correlates with climate-dependent seasonal tick activity. Cats living near heavily wooded, low-density residential areas, particularly those closest to natural or unmanaged habitats where both ticks and bobcats may be in close proximity, are at the highest risk of infection. Experimental infections have been induced with parenteral injection (subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, and intravenously) of tissue homogenates from acutely infected cats. However, infection was not induced when these tissues were administered intragastrically or when noninfected cats were housed together with infected cats in the absence of arthropod vectors.

Onset of clinical signs for cats infected with _C. felis_ usually occurs 5-14 days (about 10 on average) after infection by tick transmission. Nonspecific signs include depression, lethargy, and anorexia. Fever and dehydration are the most common findings on a physical examination; body temperature rises gradually and can reach as high as 106 F [41 C]. Other findings include icterus, lymphadenomegaly, and hepatosplenomegaly. In extremis, cats are often hypothermic, dyspneic, and vocalize as if in pain. Without treatment, death typically occurs within 2-3 days after peak in temperature.

At necropsy, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, enlarged lymph nodes, and renal edema are usually observed. The lungs show extensive edema and congestion with petechial hemorrhage on serosal surfaces and throughout the interstitium. There is progressive venous distension, especially the mesenteric and renal veins and the posterior vena cava. Hydropericardium is often seen with petechial hemorrhage of the epicardium.

When 1st described, mortality of _C. felis_ infection was reported to be nearly 100 percent. A study of _C. felis_ in northwestern Arkansas and northeastern Oklahoma indicated survival of natural infection in 18 cats with and without treatment; these cats seemed less sick initially, did not have temperatures greater than 106 F [41 C], and never became hypothermic. Similar sporadic reports in other areas exist. Some hypotheses for survival of these cats include atypical route of infection, innate immunity in certain cats, increased detection of carriers, decreased virulence with strain attenuation or occurrence of a new strain, dose of infectious inoculum, and timing and type of treatment.

Historically, attempts to treat this disease with a variety of antiparasitic drugs (parvaquone, buparvaquone, trimethoprim/sulfadiazine, sodium thiacetarsamide) have met with little success. Six of 7 cats were successfully treated with diminazene aceturate (not approved in the USA) or imido-carb dipropionate (2 mg/kg, IM, 2 injections 3-7 days apart). Most recently, a case series (n=22) reported survival of 64 percent of cats treated with a combination of atovaquone (15 mg/kg, PO, tid for 10 days) and azithromycin (10 mg/kg, PO, sid for 10 days) and supportive care.

Supportive care, including IV fluid therapy and heparin (100-200 U/kg, SC, tid), should be instituted in all cases. Nutritional support via an esophageal or nasoesophageal feeding tube is recommended and also facilitates the administration of oral medications (atovaquone and azithromycin). Oxygen therapy and blood transfusions should be administered when necessary. Anti-inflammatory drugs may be warranted in cases with unrelenting fever; however, the use of NSAID is contraindicated in cats with azotemia or dehydration. Once a diagnosis is achieved and treatments have begun, minimal stress and handling are recommended. Recovery, including resolution of fever, is often slow and may take as long as 5-7 days. Patients that survive have a complete clinical recovery, including the resolution of hematologic and biochemical abnormalities within 2-3 wk. Some survivors remain persistently infected with piroplasms and may represent a reservoir of infection.

Routine application of a tick preventive is recommended; however, disease has occurred in cats despite this treatment. Keeping cats from areas likely to be infested with the tick vector (that is, indoors only) is considered the best method of prevention.

Cats can unwittingly carry the tick indoors. If the household is a multiple animal household, then even dogs could carry some of these ticks into the home and to the cat.
