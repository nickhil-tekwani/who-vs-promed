Three more cases of suspected bird flu were reported at Telsang village
recently. Villagers were gripped with tension. The Health Department and
other departments concerned were not handling the matter satisfactorily,
they said. APCC member Mahesh Kumtalli said the District Health Department
should take the matter seriously and immediately send specialists to the
village.
Taluk medical officer Kulkarni advised the villagers to drink boiled or
filtered water. He asked them to keep their personal and surrounding
premises clean. Interestingly, no district authorities have visited the
place yet, suspected to be in the grip of the deadly avian influenza.
It may be recalled that 25 people suffering from fever were reported to
have symptoms of bird flu and were rushed to the Primary Health Centre in
Telsang village on Thur 20 Apr 2006.

The report is ambiguous, but presumed to describe human cases of avian
influenza. It should be stressed, however, that there has been no
confirmation of human cases of avian influenza anywhere in India, and this
report should be treated with extreme caution until more evidence is
forthcoming. - Mod.CP]

The country does not have any human case of avian influenza so far and the
death of a doctor who had supervised culling operations in the affected
area of Nandurbar and Jalgaon in Maharashtra was not due to avian influenza
infection, the government said today. "There is no human case of avian
influenza in India so far," health secretary P Hota told PTI.
Blood samples from the Akola-based doctor, who was suspected to have died
of avian influenza, were sent for testing to the National Institute of
Virology, Pune, [Maharashtra], he said and added that results of all 3
tests were negative for avian influenza virus. However, people should be
cautious and vigilant about the threat of bird flu, he said. The doctor was
suffering from high fever for some time.

[Positive confirmation of the final diagnosis of the unfortunate doctor's
condition would be appreciated and reinforce the negative outcome of the
avian influenza virus infection tests. A map of India, showing the location
