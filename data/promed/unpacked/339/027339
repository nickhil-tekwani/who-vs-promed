A 5th person has died in Greece due to an infection called West Nile
virus, while the number of infected people has risen to 77, reported
the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KEELPNO). According
the KEELPNO director, Yorgos Saroglu, the latest victim is a man of
85 years, from the region of Central Macedonia in northern Greece.

Today [19 Aug 2010], 13 new infections were reported, leading to
fears that the spread of the virus could continue until late
September 2010 at a rhythm of between 5-10 new infections per day,
the Greek official said.

The West Nile virus, which is transmitted through mosquito bites,
causes encephalitis.

In regions which have been affected by the virus, blood donations and
transfusions have been banned, although the government says that
hospitals have sufficient reserves. The Ministry of Health in Greece
has also enacted a temporary ban on the donation of blood by people
who were in the north of the country in recent weeks.

[The only feasible measure to prevent human cases is to avoid
mosquito bites, as has been done by "fight the bite" campaigns in the
USA. Equine animals can be vaccinated. Interestingly, no equine cases
have been reported in the outbreak yet, nor have dead wild birds such
as corvids been mentioned.
