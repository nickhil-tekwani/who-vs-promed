Newly-released data reports growing numbers in sexually transmitted diseases in Kansas. State data show that syphilis rates have more than doubled statewide over the past 4 years. The Wichita Eagle reports that 145 syphilis cases were reports in Kansas in 2014, compared to 58 cases that were reported in 2011. In Kansas, men were 3 times more likely to have syphilis than women. The disease was most common among 20- to 29-year-olds. African-Americans were more likely to have syphilis than other groups. Not-yet-finalized Sedgwick County data show that local HIV cases are also growing. The number of cases is on track to surpass the county's previous record-high.
