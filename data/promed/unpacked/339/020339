A 29 year old woman died of [a] hantavirus [infection] in the Concepción Regional Hospital. The patient had been sent from Lebu, Arauco province, where she become infected since her residence is located near rural sectors of the area.

The Chief of the Patient Critical Care Unit of the hospital, Leontina Ferreira, explained that the multiorgan failure that the patient suffered was not manageable. The woman was connected to an ECMO [extra-corporeal oxygenation] machine, the latest technology that has allowed to save the lives of 6 patients affected by hantavirus [infections with cardiopulmonary syndrome] in this hospital, but her condition was too deteriorated [to save her], added the Hospital Director Sergio Opazo.

To date [Tue 25 Apr 2017], 10 people have been admitted to the Guillermo Grant Benavente Hospital, 3 of whom have been managed with just mechanical ventilation and the remaining 6 with ECMO. This case is the only one who has died so far.

[The report above does not indicate if the hantavirus etiology of her disease was laboratory confirmed or if the diagnosis was based on clinical criteria. Although reports of this and the previous cases that have occurred in the Los Lagos region provided no information about the circumstances under which the hantavirus infection might have been acquired, in the current case the woman lived in a rural area, habitat of the rodent that may well have been the source of her infection. The other cases also may have been due to exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta in this environment. Cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly frequently in this endemic region.

Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, including the Los Lagos region, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and if it does is only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg.
