[The outbreak of cholera in Cuba was 1st reported in the eastern province of Granma in July 2012 (Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update 2012 (23): Cuba (GR) RFI Archive Number: 20120702.1187070), and, subsequently, cases spread to the western part of the island to include the Greater Havana area. The origin of the outbreak strain was thought to be from Cuban medical personnel who traveled to Haiti to help in the outbreak there.

2 earlier cases of cholera were acquired in Cuba in travelers returning to Italy and the UK during 2015 (Public Health Agency of Canada: Travel Health Notice: Cholera in Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti and Mexico. Updated 20 Mar 2015; http://phac-aspc.gc.ca/tmp-pmv/notices-avis/notices-avis-eng.php?id=111; Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (24): Americas 20150703.3480336). These were not reported from Cuba to PAHO. - Mod.LL]

[2] Cholera - Tanzania (Dar es Salaam and Morogoro regions)
Date: Fri 28 Aug 2015

The World Health Organization and the Tanzanian Ministry of Health are stepping up efforts to contain and discover the source of a cholera epidemic that so far has killed 8 people and infected more than 400 others.

WHO data indicates that the fast-spreading epidemic broke out in the Dar es Salaam and Morogoro regions nearly 2 weeks ago; the Dar es Salaam region has been most adversely affected with 354 cases and 7 deaths.

WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier tells VOA the outbreak caught health officials by surprise. "The spike is an unusual spike right now because it jumped in short time from a few hundred cases to the 404 cases," he said. "Yet cholera is endemic in Tanzania, so, as such, it is not a worrying situation, but it needs to be addressed."

After assessing needs on the ground in affected areas, WHO officials have begun procuring laboratory reagents for diagnosis. Lindmeier also says the agency is outfitting 5 operational treatment centers in the affected region with medical supplies and chemicals to treat water and disinfectants. WHO officials have said they see no connection between the current outbreak and a prior, more serious outbreak in western Tanzania's Kigoma region, which borders portions of Lake Tanganyika and Burundi.

"The cholera outbreak in Kigoma region reported between May and July [2015], related to the refugees coming from Burundi at that time, has been brought under control, with no new cases from that area for nearly a month," Lindmeier said.

The epidemic among refugees resulted in more than 4800 cases and claimed dozens of lives.

As of 16 Aug 2015, a total of 1600 cholera cases including 45 deaths (CFR 2.8 percent) have been reported in Juba and Bor Counties in Central Equatoria and Jonglei States.

In Juba County, 1470 cases including 44 deaths (CFR 2.99 percent) have been reported. In Bor, 130 cases including one death (CFR 0.77 percent) have been reported from Malou in Makuach Payam and other areas within the county. Kator, Rejaf, Northern Bari, Gondokoro, and Munuki are the most affected areas in Juba County, with attack rates (cases per 10 000) of 252, 221, 167, 26.7, and 26.6, respectively. Makuach is the most affected area in Bor and has registered an attack rate (cases per 10 000) of 33.

A total of 18 new cholera cases were reported in Juba on 16 Aug 2015 with the majority originating from Gondokoro, Jebel Dinka, and Gumbo Shirkat. During week 33 of 2015 (week of 16 Aug 2015), most of the cholera cases in Juba originated from Gondokoro; Gurei, Lemon Gaba, and Mangatain, Jebel Dinka, and Gudele in Northern Bari; Gumbo in Rejaf; Nyakuron and Jebel Kujur in Munuki; Kor William in Kator; and Buluk and Tongping in Juba (Figures 1.1 and 3). During week 33 of 2015, the most affected areas in Juba County were Gondokoro, Northern Bari, Kator, Rejaf, Munuki, and Juba, which registered attack rates (cases per 10 000) of 15.5, 14.5, 8.8, 7.0, 1.2, and 0.9 respectively.

Within Juba County and its most affected areas of Juba, Northern Bari, Munuki, Rejaf, and Kator, children under 10 years and young adults aged 20-34 years are the most affected, while in Makuach, Bor County, children under 10 years are the most affected. Out of the 1464 cholera cases with known gender in Juba, 637 (44 percent) were female, while 827 (56 percent) were male, while in Bor, 75 (58 percent) of the cases were females, while 55 (42 percent) were males.

The probable risk factors fueling transmission include: residing in a crowded IDP camp with poor sanitation and hygiene; using untreated water from the water tankers; lack of household chlorination of drinking water; eating food from unregulated roadside food vendors or makeshift markets; open defecation/poor latrine use; and attending/eating food at a funeral.

A total of 324 (90 percent) of the samples have been RDT positive, while 46 (41 percent) have been confirmed by culture after the National Public Health Laboratory isolated _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 Inaba. Most of the culture-confirmed cases have been reported from Juba.

Seven stool samples were shipped to the Central Public Health Laboratory in Uganda for testing. _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 serogroup Inaba was isolated from one of the samples, while 6 samples tested negative for cholera but were positive for nonpathogenic _Escherichia coli_. Three isolates were confirmed as positive, and 3 tested negative on repeat testing in Uganda, thus confirming earlier test results by the National Public Health Laboratory.
