Nuclear disaster software tracks disease
-----------------------------------------------
A computer model designed to track nuclear fallout in the aftermath of the
Chernobyl disaster has proved crucial to the Government's efforts to
predict and prevent the spread of the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) epidemic.
The software has allowed scientists to draw up a unique "footprint" for
each outbreak, showing the direction and distance over which the virus can
disperse on the wind.
The maps -- which take account of weather conditions and local geographical
features -- have been used to decide the size and shape of "firebreak"
zones in which healthy animals must be culled to prevent infection.
The model works by calculating the amount of virus likely to be present
around an infected farm, and shows 3 zones of risk. In the "prime risk"
area, normally no more than 1 mile away in the direction of the wind, there
are between 1.0 and 5.0 units of virus present.
A unit value of 1.0 or higher is enough to create a significant danger of
infection. Professor David King, the Government's chief scientific adviser,
said new outbreaks were confirmed on farms every day because the virus
could be carried up to 60 miles on the breeze.
"Pigs are 100 times more infectious than other livestock. They could send a
huge plume into the air capable of being carried for 100 kilometers," he said.

WASHINGTON: Federal emergency officials are preparing for a US outbreak of
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), a prospect seen as highly likely. About 75
federal officials from agencies ranging from the US Agriculture Department
(USDA) to the CIA met to review plans for addressing an outbreak of the
highly infectious animal virus. The group included officials from the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Army's biological warfare
office, the Coast Guard, the Interior Department, and the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).
FEMA official Bruce Baughman said the plans call for treating an outbreak
much the same as a natural disaster, in which states take primary
responsibility and call on federal resources as needed. "We are certainly
treating it like it's a probable likelihood," he said.
Others present at the meeting said the chances the disease will spread to
the US were described as very high, fueling an intensive planning effort.
Until now, the government has focused in its public statements on efforts
to keep the disease from reaching the United States.
Officials described arrangements for earth-moving equipment to bury
thousands of animal carcasses, and the drafting of emergency orders could
suspend some environmental regulations to allow quick burial of afflicted
livestock.
Inquiries about the government's assessment of the risk of a US outbreak of
the disease were referred to Cliff Oliver, who is heading emergency
response plans for the USDA.
USDA spokesman Kevin Herglotz described the meeting as a standard planning
session and said his department does not believe an outbreak is inevitable.
FMD affects pigs, cattle and other cloven-hoofed animals, including llamas,
alpacas, camels, and even elephants, but is not generally harmful to humans.
The US has not had a case of FMD since 1929. In England, the current
outbreak began in February and quickly spread.
Cases also have been confirmed in the Netherlands, France, and Ireland.
Recent outbreaks have occurred in Saudi Arabia, Argentina, South Korea, and
Taiwan.
The US government has added hundreds of inspectors at airports and ports in
an effort to keep the disease out, but the battle is made more difficult by
booming global travel and trade.
