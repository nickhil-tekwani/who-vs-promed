Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Claims 4 More Lives
---------------------------------------------------
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) has once again struck the
interior parts of Baluchistan, as 4 nomads including a baby have fallen
prey to the disease in past few days. The new cases have been reported in
Baden Tingi, a far-flung village of Qila Saifullah district. The epidemic
is also reported in the areas near the Pakistan-Afghan border.
The latest victims of CCHFV infection include 3 adult [family members] and
a young child who died within 3 days of the [appearance of symptoms]. It is
relevant here that medical facilities are not available in this remote
region, and as a consequence the death toll may rise in the near future.
Contrary to government claims, no medical team has yet arrived in the area
to ascertain the gravity of the epidemic and treat affected patients.

[Several cases of presumptive CCHFV infection were treated in Quetta in
early to mid-May involving individuals from several locations near the
Pakistan-Afghan border. Clinical samples were sent to South Africa for
laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis, but the outcome has not been
reported. These new cases of presumptive CCHFV infection may indicate
expansion of the initial outbreak, or alternatively reflect a seasonal
increase of tick activity over the whole region. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic
fever can be contracted both by tick-bite and by direct contact with the
blood and body fluids of infected domestic animals or human patients.
Consequently nosocomial infection is not uncommon, especially where disease
is not recognized and there are no facilities for precise diagnosis. - Mod.CP]
