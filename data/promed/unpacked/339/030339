More than 80 people are ill in France due to a _Salmonella_ outbreak linked to a meat product from Italy. A spokeswoman from Sante Publique [Public Health] France told Food Safety News that 83 people had been infected by _Salmonella_ Typhimurium and 13 of them needed hospital treatment.

Coppa of the brand Di Vittorio supplied by Castelli France, founded in 1991 and based in Marseille, was recalled last week. Sliced or whole coppa sold between 17 May 2019 and 8 Jul 2019 country-wide was part of the recall. Consumer complaints led the French supermarket Intermarche to alert authorities and withdraw the Italian charcuterie from the sale. Authorities told people who still have the products not to consume them and to take items back to the place of purchase.

The foodborne outbreak is suspected to be caused by _Salmonella_ Typhimurium in coppa from Italy, with raw material from France and Germany. Both men and women aged between 18 to 84 years old are ill while 7 children are also sick. The 1st patient was reported at the start of June [2019] and the last so far was early July [2019]. Those ill come from 5 different regions in the country.

Customer complaints were reported to the French General Directorate of Food (DGAL) and then Sante Publique France, the country's public health agency. Collective food poisoning was reported by health professionals to the Regional Agencies of Health (ARS). Patients were asked about food consumption before illness onset and _Salmonella_ strains isolated from their stools have been sent to the National Reference Center of Salmonella at the Institut Pasteur for typing.
