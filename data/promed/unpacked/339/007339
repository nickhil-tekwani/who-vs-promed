Fever kills 2000 pigs in Adjumani district
-----------------------------------------------
Over 2000 pigs have died of African swine fever in Adjumani district
in the last week [1st week January 2006]. Dozens of rotting carcasses
on Thursday [5 Jan 2006] lay in the villages, while many other pigs
were being given out to the residents to eat.
The Veterinary Officer in charge of the Eastern zone, Dr. Christopher
Dratele, confirmed the report to Daily Monitor on Friday [6 Jan 2006].
"It's true the disease has hit the area, and our department is trying
hard to contain the pandemic from spreading further. Our farmers have
lost many animals," he said.
Dratele said the worst affected sub-counties include Pakelle, Dzaipi
and Ofua, where over 1500 pigs had been reported dead in the last 5 days.
"This type of disease spreads very fast, especially if proactive
measures are not taken in time by the farmers. We have been advising
them to keep their pigs indoor to avoid catching the disease, since
it can even be spread through eating the bones of the dead animals," he said.
Dratele said they were still tracing the origin of the epidemic that
kills about 100 pigs in the affected areas on a daily basis. He
blamed the residents for failing to carry out proactive measures to
curb the disease.
Meanwhile, the veterinary department in the district has already put
a quarantine on pigs and their products from leaving the district.

[African swine fever (ASF), which is rather endemic in Uganda, is an
infectious disease of domestic and wild pigs that affects animals of
all breeds and ages, and which is caused by a virus that produces a
range of syndromes. The ASF virus is the only member of the
_Asfarviridae_ family.
Acute disease is characterized by high fever, hemorrhages in the
reticuloendothelial system, and a high mortality rate. Infectious
virus can survive for several months in fresh and salted dried-meat
products. The disease is not zoonotic. - Mod.AS]
