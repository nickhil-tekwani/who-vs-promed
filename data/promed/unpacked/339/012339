Iowa regulators Tuesday afternoon, 13 Feb 2018, issued a consumer advisory for chicken salad bought from Fareway stores. The food has been implicated in multiple cases of salmonellosis across the state, according to the Iowa Department of Public Health. A press release states that Fareway voluntarily stopped the sale of the chicken salad and pulled it from store shelves after being contacted by regulators. None of the chicken salad has been sold to the public since Fri 9 Feb 2018.

The chicken salad is produced and packaged by a 3rd party for Fareway, according to the release. People who purchased chicken salad from Fareway should throw it away, according to the release.

Fareway Stores, Inc. is a retail grocery store chain based in Boone, Iowa, with most of its stores in the upper mid-west of the USA and unrelated to the Fairway Markets in the New York City area.

Iowa, the Hawkeye state, is located in the Midwestern part of the USA and can be seen on a map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa. In colonial times, Iowa was a part of French Louisiana and Spanish Louisiana; its state flag is patterned after the flag of France. After the Louisiana Purchase, people laid the foundation for an agriculture-based economy in the heart of the Corn Belt. - Mod.LL
