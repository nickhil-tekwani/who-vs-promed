ALCOHOL CONTAMINATION, FATAL - RUSSIA, LATVIA, BELARUS

The current series of poisonings by alcohol substitutes can be seen
as a sporadic problem: probably a large amount of technical spirit
[crude ethanol spirit containing various chemical impurities] has
quickly been distributed across Russia and neighboring countries.
Now, villains will sell, sick citizens will survive, and law
enforcement departments will catch whomever they can. Then
consumption of substitutes will return to its former habitual level,
un-remarked by the authorities, where 30 000 - 40 000 people die from
it per year.
Russia
------
Pskov: a state of emergency was declared the day before yesterday [25
Oct 2006] in the Pskov region in connection with mass alcohol
poisoning. There are already 442 patients with the diagnosis "toxic
hepatitis;" 15 have died. [Map at:

Latvia
------
In the Latvian city of Prejli [Preili], 54 persons have been poisoned
by illegal alcohol, and 6 have died -- see ProMED ref. below. [Map

Belarus
------
In the Oshmyanskiy district of Grodnenskiy region, 33 people were
hospitalized with a preliminary diagnosis of adulterated alcohol
poisoning. They are being treated for toxic hepatitis in the
therapeutic and infectious diseases department of Oshmyanskiy
district hospital. One elderly woman has died. Laboratory tests are
being carried out to confirm the diagnosis.
According to physicians, the hospitalized patients are in the 30-60
year age range, and not all of them are chronic alcoholics. Police
are investigating the source of the alcohol. [Map at:

Historical
-----------
Similar "epidemics" have happened earlier in Russia:
*January - March 2004 in the Krasnoyarsk region
*January - July 2005 in Kostroma
*August - September 2006 in the Belgorod, Voronezh and Tver regions.
There have been hundreds of victims.
It is tempting to blame this epidemic of alcohol poisoning on the new
situation in the legal alcohol market, which has been thrown off
track by the import ban on Georgian and Moldavian wines. But Russians
drink adulterated alcohol not because Georgian wine has disappeared
from the shops or vodka is sold adulterated. The statistics are sadly
stable: deaths from poisoning by poor quality alcohol in Russia run
about 40 000 per year.
According to patients, they bought vodka from visiting vendors
trading from motor vehicles. But it would be an illusion to believe
that the buyers do not know that the sellers are deceiving them.
Consumers will easily make a drink from bath liquid or window cleaner
fluid, it is much cheaper than buying vodka in the shop.
The profitability of counterfeit vodka is known to be very high.
Taxes are twice the cost price. Demand is great for 2 simple reasons:
alcohol is a drug, and there is no money for expensive, quality
alcohol. To cope with the demand is difficult and costly, special
programs for the rehabilitation of alcoholics are necessary. To cope
with the supply is also difficult, due to the high profitability of
the business. The present "fire-fighting" measures like checks of
vending machines on streets and inspections of shops will not produce
a long-term result.

[From the maps, it is clear that the problem is not restricted to
European Russia (west of the Urals) and its neighbors there, but
extends as far east as Irkutsk, on the trans-Siberian railway. Other
countries and continents have periodically reported similar
outbreaks; see ProMED archives below. - Mod.JW]
