Sea lions getting sick in leptospirosis outbreak
-----------------------------------------
An outbreak of a bacterial infection that can effect humans and animals is
making sea lions sick along the Central Coast. A disease called
leptospirosis is being blamed for making more than 100 sea lions sick in
less than 2 months.
The Marine Mammal Center in Moss Landing has taken in 120 sick sea lions in
the past 6 weeks. The head of the center says that about a third of the sea
lions are dying of the illness. Statewide, the center says about 45 percent
of the sea lions rescued this year [2004] have been diagnosed with
leptospirosis. That's up from less than 5 percent last year [2003].
Humans can become sick with the disease by swallowing contaminated food or
water, or, by contact through open sores and cuts [Leptospires have been
known to penetrate intact mucosa in the conjunctiva, etc., as well. -
Mod.PC]. The Centers for Disease Control says lepto can be treated in
humans with antibiotics.

[Although the ProMED-mail reference on unexplained deaths in Harbor Seals
(see below) provides a passing mention of a previous outbreak of
leptospirosis in sea lions in the 1980s, the article above doesn't provide
many details on the epidemiology of the current outbreak.
Leptospirosis, aka Weil's disease or swineherd's disease, is the most
common zoonotic disease in the tropics. This is a classic zoonosis, as the
organism is maintained in a wide variety of animal hosts, both domestic
animals as well as wildlife, but human to human infection is extremely
rare. Disease has been reported in the following species: humans, cattle,
horses, swine, dogs, rats, deer, squirrels, foxes, skunks, raccoons,
opossums, sea lions, reptiles, frogs, field mice, voles, shrews, and hedgehogs.
An infected animal's renal tubules harbor the bacteria and shed the
organisms for months. The environment is contaminated with infected urine,
and subsequent transmission often occurs by contact with water, food, or soil.
Leptospirosis has classically been thought of as an occupational zoonosis
affecting agricultural workers, such as sugar cane cutters, rice field
workers, farmers, or veterinarians. However, this disease can be considered
a re-emerging problem, as it is increasingly being seen in outbreaks in
recreational settings: a triathlon in Illinois infecting almost 400 people
and an "eco-challenge" in Malaysia sickening 68 people. Furthermore, we
have seen several recent outbreaks due to floods. - Mod.PC]
