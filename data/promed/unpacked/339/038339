10 new cases detected in Guzo & Santa Marianita. Quarantine declared.
Chimborazo: Foot & mouth disease affects 50 bovines
----------------------------------------------
Riobamba: the number of bovines affected by FMD has increased from 40 to 50
in Chimborazo. The Servicio de Sanidad Agropecuaria (SESA) says that the 10
new cases are in El Guzo (Penipe) & Santa Marianita (Guano).

On 8 Oct 2002 the executive director of Conefa, Medardo Lazo, inspected the
area & ordered the disinfection of Camal de Diorama & the center of the
cattle market, situated at the exit to Chambo. In addition, the vaccination
campaign continues. In Chimborazo there are 140 000 head of cattle. It is an
Amerindian community where the recommendation to vaccinate depends on the
interest of local chiefs in spreading it in the Qichua language.
