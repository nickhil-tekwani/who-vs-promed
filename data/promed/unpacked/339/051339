The International Animal Health Code of the OIE (Office International des
Epizooties/ International Animal Health Organization, 12 rue de Prony 75017
PARIS FRANCE; FAX (33) 01 42 67 09 87) is requiring in its article 3.1.5.9
about frozen dog semen and rabies that the donor male shall not show clinical
signs of rabies during the 15 days after collection (addition made in 1995).
The OIE is recognized by the WHO (World Trade Organization) [That is what the
original message said; however, it should be either "WHO (World Health
Organization) or "WTO (World Trade Organization) -- Mod CHC] to be the
international standard organization for animal health. Furthermore any
veterinarian knows that there is no excretion of virus, even in saliva, prior
to the 10 days before the animal dies. That is why, as a safety measure, it
is usually compulsory to observe any biting dog (in a country where rabies
occurs) for at least 15 days after the bite. If the animal dies within this
period it's brain must be sent for analysis for rabies. If not, the dog
could not excrete the virus the day of biting.

Steve...Quoted from the MERCK VETERINARY MANUAL re: rabies: "hematogenous
spread can occur, but is rare".
I guess a person can make of that whatever they want to vis a vis spread via
body fluids. As a matter of fact, now that I'm thinking of it, there is a
case on record where a person contracted rabies when he received a corneal
transplant from a donor who died of the disease (misdiagnosed as a stroke)!!

[Lots of words but it appears there are no data. Not usually much semen in a
cornea. String cut. -- Mod CHC]
