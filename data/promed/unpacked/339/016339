[In posting 20050122.0233, the moderator remarked: "It would be interesting
to compare the Tasmanian observations and pathologic findings with the
neoplasms described 20 years earlier in 18 Tasmanian devils that were
necropsied at the San Diego Zoo; see Griner LA., (1979). Neoplasms in
Tasmanian devils (_Sarcophilus harrisii_). JNCI 62(3):589-95."

Re: PRO/AH/EDR> Undiagnosed deaths, Tasmanian devils - Australia
-----------------------------------------------
In response to the moderator's comment regarding Dr. Griner's Tasmanian
devil cases at the San Diego Zoo, it is difficult to make direct
comparisons, since we have not seen any of the facial tumor cases from the
current outbreak. However, reviewing Dr. Griner's report and some of the
cases we've had here over the years, there seem to be few similarities.
Most of the neoplasia cases we've had in Tasmanian devils have been
adenocarcinomas of the mammary, thyroid, and perianal glands. We haven't
seen any cases that primarily involved the head or face, and none that were
suspected to be of neuroendocrine origin. So I'm afraid our cases don't
offer much insight into what is now occurring with the wild population, but
we certainly wish our Tasmanian colleagues all the best in their
investigations.
