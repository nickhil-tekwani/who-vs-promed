Dengue outbreak alarms Zambo officials
-----------------------------------------------
Despite the city government's continuing anti-dengue campaign, the number
of cases continues to increase, and health officials are alarmed that the
number of dengue fever cases is already reaching "outbreak" proportions.
City Health Officer Rodel Agbulos said on Monday [30 May 2005] that 289
dengue cases were registered in his office between January and 1 May 2005,
up from 40 cases over the same period last year. It was an increase of 298
percent.
Agbulos said the places that have a high number of dengue cases this year
[2005] are the health districts of Santa Maria, Baliwasan and Sangali.
He met on Monday [30 May 2005] with the dengue-control team to come up with
measures to contain the problem, and he sought the help of concerned
government agencies to curb the incidence of the disease.
Agbulos would also re-activate the barangay dengue brigade to intensify the
anti-dengue campaign.
According to Medicine Net.com, the website of the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, dengue fever is an acute viral infection caused by
a bite from the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito. The primary form of dengue fever
is characterized by a skin rash and a high fever with severe headache and
muscle pain. Other symptoms may include chills, diarrhea and vomiting.
Bouts of extreme exhaustion may last for months after the initial symptoms.
The Department of Health reports thousands of dengue cases each year. In
June last year [2004], the health department reported that a total of 2332
dengue cases were admitted to sentinel hospitals nationwide from 1 Jan to
15 May 2004, with 16 deaths.
The DOH National Epidemiology Center (NEC) reported a 58 percent decrease
in the number of cases this year [2005] compared with the same period in 2003.
According to the NEC's mid-year report last year [2004], the regions with
the highest number of cases were Metro Manila, Central Luzon, Bicol and
Eastern Visayas. The ages of cases ranged from one month to 75 years old,
with 46 percent (535) of the cases belonging to the one-year-to-9-years age
group.
Health officials usually note an increase in dengue cases during the rainy
season, and the DOH repeatedly warns the public to bring a suspected dengue
case to the nearest hospital for early diagnosis.

Thailand warns of more major dengue outbreaks
----------------------------
Thailand said on Thursday it feared more major outbreaks of dengue fever, a
sometimes fatal disease with so far has killed 16 people this year.
In tropical Thailand, where mosquitoes are a familiar pest in every home,
dengue has so far infected 10 390 people this year, of whom 16 have died.
It infected 2687 people during the week of 22-28 May [2005] alone, of whom
2 died, the Health Ministry said.
"Dengue fever this year has a tendency to be more severe than last year,
possibly because of the cycle of the outbreaks, erupting every 2 years, is
reaching its peak this year," Health Minister Suchai Charoenrattanakul said
in a statement.
"As Thailand is now in the rainy season, we would like to urge all 12
million households to be careful."
The mosquito-born disease, for which there is no vaccine and no specific
treatment, killed 176 of 114 800 infected people in 2002.
Symptoms include high fever, severe headaches, backache, joint pain, nausea
and vomiting, eye pain and rashes.

During the rainy season, there is a higher frequency of _Aedes aegypti_ bites
-----------------------------------------------
The 1st case of dengue hemorrhagic fever has been reported in Orotina. It
is a 28-year-old woman who was referred to Monser Sanabria Hospital in
Puntarenas. Dengue fever is becoming more prevalent. For the same time
period in 2004, 2679 cases of dengue fever were reported, and we already
have 3560 cases for 2005.
Summer time was the ideal time to eliminate mosquito breeding places, and
we have to act rapidly these days, since _Aedes aegypti_ may be closer than
we imagine.
Last year, 11 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever occurred, and no deaths
were reported. Limon and Pacifico Central areas are the favorite breeding
places for the mosquitoes.

A campaign is announced for dengue fever prevention in Guatemala because of
the upcoming rainy season
-----------------------------------------------
Official sources said last Tuesday [17 May 2005] that Guatemala's
Government will start next Thursday a nationally-based campaign for dengue
fever (both classic and hemorrhagic forms) prevention. This disease usually
strikes the country during the rainy season, and it caused 9 deaths last year.
The campaign will involve the delivery of information regarding dengue, as
well as fumigation and rubbish and water recipient elimination, since the
latter serve as breeding places for the mosquito that acts as a vector for
dengue fever, said Dr. Mario Gudiel, Director of the Health Care Integrated
System.
The officer explained that during 2005, 1106 dengue fever cases, and only 3
cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever, were reported throughout the country,
but there have been no deaths.
Meanwhile, during 2004, 6000 dengue fever cases, and 30 cases of dengue
hemorrhagic fever, were reported, and there were 9 deaths.
According to the Meteorology Institute, winter season has already started
in Guatemala, and it will last for 5 months.

There is an increase in the number of patients with dengue fever
-----------------------------------------------
Most people affected by the disease are children. That is why the City
Council schedules community activities, as well as fumigation and the
delivery of educational material regarding dengue, malaria, leptospirosis, etc.
This campaign will be carried out in high risk areas and in some other
provinces.
