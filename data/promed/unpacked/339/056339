Viral Conjunctivitis Outbreak in Dagupan City
--------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of viral conjunctivitis, or sore eyes, in Dagupan City,
northern Philippines, has puzzled local doctors as this is not the
season for such an epidemic outbreak, reported the Philippine News
Agency (PNA) on Sat 11 Sep 2004.
PNA quoted Dr. Leonardo Carbonnel, assistant city health officer in
Dagupan City, as saying that the spread of viral conjunctivitis could
be due to a possible shift from the normal epidemiology of the
disease owing to environmental degradation [contamination of water
supplies?]. He said in a radio interview that he was surprised to
[discover that] there are so many people afflicted with sore eyes
when it is not summer yet. Confirming that conjunctivitis is a summer
disease, it is taking medical practitioners by surprise that the
disease is raging this rainy season, which usually sees the outbreak
of such diseases as gastroenteritis and dengue, he said. The summer
season in the Philippines covers the period from February to April,
during which time diseases such as sore eyes and chickenpox break out.
But Carbonnel assured those afflicted with sore eyes that viral
conjunctivitis is not fatal, and can be cured within 7 days unless
the patient is further infected. He called on people to be careful,
because if they touch anything held by an infected person, chances
are that they may also get conjunctivitis, a very contagious disease
whose transmission is very fast. People can wash their eyes with soap
and lukewarm water, he said, advising people to develop the habit of
washing their hands frequently with clean water and soap if they
cannot afford to buy an alcohol-based [disinfectant].
He also said that since many people have conjunctivitis in Dagupan
City, people should avoid crowds and those already infected should
stay at home.

[Viral conjunctivitis is associated with infection by several types
of adenoviruses or enteroviruses. Readers are referred for further
details to a comment on adenoviral-related conjunctivitis by
Professor Niklas Arnberg (Department of Virology Umea University
SE-90185 Umea Sweden) in connection with a recent outbreak of
conjunctivitis in China (see: Conjunctivitis - China (Hainan) (02):
background 20040902.2446 ). Conjunctivitis as a consequence of
enteroviral infection might be more likely during summer months due
to greater likelihood of exposure to sewage-contaminated water. -
