The Iowa Department of Agriculture is confirming a new case of the bird flu in Bremer County.

This [backyard flock] is the 2nd confirmed case of HPAI in Bremer County, Iowa. The 1st case was in a commercial turkey flock on 20 Apr [2022].

Officials say flock owners should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds and report sick birds or unusual deaths to state officials.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has been confirmed in 2 more Wisconsin turkey flocks, while the virus has also been confirmed in a new county in Pennsylvania, according to the latest information from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).

In addition, new HPAI cases were confirmed in commercial turkey flocks in Minnesota and South Dakota, but information regarding those cases so far is limited.

Wisconsin:
Two new cases of HPAI were confirmed in commercial turkey flocks in Wisconsin on 3 May [2022].

Both flocks are located in Barron County. The larger of the 2 flocks contained 47 200 turkeys, while the other housed 19 300.

These cases were confirmed just days after avian influenza was found in another Barron County flock, with that one involving 110 700 turkeys.

To date [4 May 2022], Wisconsin has had 6 cases of HPAI in commercial poultry in 2022. Four of those occurred in Barron County.

Pennsylvania:
APHIS reported 2 new cases of HPAI in Pennsylvania, both of which are in Berks County. One of the affected premises was identified as a commercial duck breeder and involved 29 500 birds. The other was described as a commercial duck meat bird operation, but APHIS has not yet disclosed the size of that flock.

These are the 1st HPAI cases in Berks County. Previously, all of the state's cases were in Lancaster County. Those included 4 layer operations, one duck operation, one broiler breeder pullet flock, and one broiler flock.

The total number of birds affected by HPAI in Pennsylvania currently stands at 3 874 700.

Minnesota:
A new case of HPAI was reported by APHIS and the Minnesota Board of Animal Health, which involved a commercial turkey flock in Lyon County. However, neither agency reported the size of the flock.

This is the 1st detection in Lyon County, but there have been 57 cases in commercial poultry flocks in Minnesota this year [2022], with the total number of birds being affected approaching 3 million.

South Dakota:
APHIS reported a new case of HPAI in a commercial turkey flock in Beadle County, South Dakota, but the flock size has not yet been disclosed.

This is the 4th case in Beadle County. There have been 36 cases of HPAI in commercial operations in South Dakota in 2022, with the majority of those being turkey operations.

[3] Minnesota: statewide, all birds
Date: Thu 5 May 2022

https://knsiradio.com/2022/05/05/sixty-eight-sites-in-minnesota-reporting-bird-flu-infections/


The Minnesota Board of Animal Health says there are now 68 sites in Minnesota reporting highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) infections.

The board says 2.72 million birds have been affected across 22 counties.

There are 35 sites across Benton, Kandiyohi, Meeker, Morrison, and Stearns counties affecting backyard flocks and commercial meat, breeder, and egg operations. When a bird flu infection has been identified, the flock is depopulated to prevent sick animals from entering the food supply. There is a low risk of humans contracting avian influenza. Experts say poultry and poultry products are safe to consume.

It's not just commercial and backyard flocks affected. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources says it is coordinating with the US Department of Agriculture's Plant and Animal Health Inspection Service to conduct surveillance for HPAI in wild birds. Officials with the University of Minnesota Raptor Center say there have been more than 5 dozen [60] confirmed cases among raptors. That included great horned owls, a barred owl, bald eagles, and a turkey vulture. All but one with a positive test died or was put down. Songbirds, crows, and geese are also being sickened.

The latest outbreak was 1st discovered in Minnesota on 25 Mar [2022].

[4] Wisconsin (Sauk, Pierce counties): backyard flock
Date: Sun 8 May 2022

https://www.wispolitics.com/2022/datcp-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-identified-in-sauk-pierce-counties/


The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCP) has identified cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in backyard flocks in Pierce and Sauk counties. Birds on both sites will be depopulated to prevent spread of the disease.

Eleven counties in Wisconsin have been confirmed with HPAI in domestic flocks. Flock owners are encouraged to continue practicing strong biosecurity measures to protect their birds from the virus. This includes washing hands, disinfecting equipment, restricting access to birds, and separating new birds from existing flocks for at least 30 days. Poultry owners are asked, when possible, to keep their birds indoors.

DATCP also encourages poultry owners to register their premises. State law requires all livestock owners register where their animals are kept, and registration helps animal health officials communicate with flock owners during disease outbreaks.

To report increased mortality or signs of illness among domestic birds, contact DATCP. Signs of HPAI include

- sudden death without clinical signs;
- lack of energy or appetite;
- decrease in egg production; soft, misshapen eggs;
- purple discoloration of wattles, comb, and legs;
- difficulty breathing;
- runny nose, coughing, sneezing;
- stumbling or falling down; and
- diarrhea.

[5] Colorado (Weld County): commercial layers

https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/avian-influenza-weld-county/73-1f51dfc4-1de5-48bb-ae7d-09c917658d05


The state veterinarian has issued a quarantine order for poultry in parts of Weld County after a deadly bird disease was detected at a facility there.

According to a report from the Colorado Department of Agriculture, the State Veterinarian's Office received a report of an unusually high number of chickens dying at a commercial egg-laying operation in Weld County on 28 Apr [2022].

The detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), a type of bird flu, was confirmed by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory the next day [29 Apr 2022], the report says.

The facility houses 1.36 million birds and produces eggs for food, according to the report. Euthanasia of the chickens began on 1 May [2022].

People who don't directly interact with birds are unlikely to catch the virus, and properly cooked poultry is still safe to eat, experts say.

The quarantine order is intended to limit the movement of birds in and out of the area, the report says.

HPAI virus strains are extremely infectious and often fatal to chickens. They can spread rapidly from flock to flock.

[HPAI] has been detected in 4 Colorado counties: Weld, Pitkin, Montrose, and La Plata. It has affected 1.42 million commercial chickens and 74 backyard poultry, according to the report. Before the Weld County detection, the largest operation to be affected was a 60 000-bird flock in Montrose County.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , this avian flu strain can be deadly to humans, but these infections only occur when people have close contact with sick birds, and it's rare for the disease to spread from human to human. No cases of HPAI in people have ever been reported in the US.

The state veterinarian's office has asked all poultry and bird owners to take measures to keep the disease out of Colorado's domestic poultry.

Commercial and backyard poultry owners in Weld County are encouraged to report the status of their flocks here.

[Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) continues to sweep the deadly avian virus across the continent. The number of birds having been euthanized or dying from this virus is in the many millions. Clearly this is impacting availability of poultry products and increasing prices on many levels. Wild birds are also being affected.

It is paramount to protect your birds, including our wildlife birds. If you own birds -- even as a small operator -- biosecurity is a very high priority. Live it, breathe it, practice it. - Mod.TG
