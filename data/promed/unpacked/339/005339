Ho Chi Minh City is gearing up to stop the spread of dengue fever.
Since early this year [2011], the city has experienced 9000 cases of
dengue fever, up 1.6 times from a year earlier [2010], including 6
deaths. According to the health sector, prolonged rain is ideal for
mosquitoes to spread the disease.
