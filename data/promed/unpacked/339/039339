Four wards in Wellington Hospital have been isolated to try to stop the
spread of a dangerous "superbug". The unprecedented move comes after a jump
in cases of the drug resistant bug methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus
aureus_ (MRSA). There has been a 50 percent rise in the number of cases of
MRSA, which is resistant to standard drugs, at Capital Coast Health since
February, with 121 people affected since June last year.
MRSA has been associated with two deaths in New Zealand. It resists almost
all antibiotics and it is dangerous to people in hospital who are already
unwell.
Infectious diseases physician Tim Blackmore says the number of cases of
MRSA are still small, with only about three or four patients currently
affected. He says patients and relatives are having to wear gloves for
normal patient contact in four areas - the intensive care unit, and a
medical, surgical and heart ward.
