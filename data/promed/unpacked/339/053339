RE: Influenza-associated rash - USA: Request for Information (Archive Number: 20150318.3238651)

In response to the ProMED-mail post from the US CDC regarding cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza with measles-like rash, we would like to highlight a case series of morbilliform and other rash presentations also due to influenza B during the spring of 2014 that we recently reported in Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses (Skowronski et al. 2014, available open access from: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/irv.12296/full).

In this case series, we provide photo illustrations and describe investigations into several reports of various rash presentations (localized and generalized) with laboratory-confirmed influenza B during school outbreaks of influenza-like illness in a rural community of British Columbia, Canada, undertaken in the context of a documented measles outbreak occurring elsewhere in the province. We review the few other reports of rash associated with influenza A and B in the published literature, and postulate possible biological mechanisms to explain this uncommon feature of influenza infection in the absence of other etiologies.

Although the causative role or mechanisms for influenza B in morbilliform or other rash presentations remain uncertain, we look forward to further information from our US colleagues to add to this interesting observation.
