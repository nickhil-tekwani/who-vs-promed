Southern Taiwan heightens alert against dengue fever
----------------------------------------------------
Taiwan has so far reported 18 cases of imported dengue fever, but no local
cases. The government has activated its dengue fever awareness mechanism,
with central and local governments joining hands to check the outbreak of
the mosquitoborne disease.
The Executive Yuan's service center in southern Taiwan urged heightened
alert yesterday against dengue fever and asked passengers returning from
Indonesia and Vietnam to keep tabs on their own health.
In view of the continued spread of dengue fever in South East Asia, and
with the situation in Indonesia and Vietnam especially serious, the service
center invited related government agencies to a dengue fever prevention
meeting in Koahsiung, southern Taiwan, yesterday.

[Dengue activity appears to have peaked in some provinces but is still on
the rise in others such as Kota (City) Palembang, and Aceh - ProMED-mail]

Dengue fever in Indonesia - update 3
---------------------------------
From 1 Jan to 4 Apr 2004 a total of 52 013 mainly hospitalized cases of
dengue and 603 deaths have been registered with the Indonesian Ministry of
Health. The overall case fatality rate this year [2004], particularly in
Jakarta, has been lower than in previous years ( see previous report
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_03_29/en/>).
Dengue occurs every year in Indonesia, but this year [2004] the number of
cases has been unusually high in at least 12 of 32 provinces of the country
(see map at URL above). Compared with the same period last year [2003], the
number of cases has doubled. Provinces in Java including Jawa Barat, Jawa
Tengah, and Jawa Timur have been particularly severely affected, with more
than 35 per cent of the cases reported from DKI-Jakarta. More than half of
Indonesia's 212 million people live in Java.
Although the total number of monthly reported cases has continued to
increase in March as compared with January and February [2004], the weekly
reporting in the provinces shows that the outbreak has peaked in
DKI-Jakarta, Bali, and Nusa Tenggarah Barat in mid-March. In other
provinces reporting fewer cases, the dengue activity appears to have peaked
in some as in the Papua provinces of Merauke and Sorong, but is still on
the rise in others as in Kota (City) Palembang, and Aceh. DEN-3 appears to
be the predominant circulating virus, but Den- 4, Den-2, and Den-1
serotypes have also been confirmed in samples taken from patients in
DKI-Jakarta.
The Ministry of Health has set up rapid response and surveillance teams to
update and analyze the data from all provinces to guide appropriate action.
The national government is providing free hospital care to those patients
presenting with symptoms of dengue and without adequate financial resources.
The local health authorities are conducting intensive vector control
activities and, with the assistance of larval field inspectors, are
mobilizing the communities to eliminate unwanted containers in which _Aedes
aegypti_, the mosquito vector of dengue, breeds. WHO is assisting the
Ministry of Health with laboratory diagnosis.

Alert on dengue
---------------
Official report has it that there is a dengue epidemic. The national lab
has diagnosed 137 people with the disease and 175 questionable cases that
are being examined currently. The authorities are talking about an alarming
situation.
The contagious diseases sector of the National Health Administration is
currently very busy tackling the spreading disease. A so-called outbreak
team was formed to watch and combat the epidemic. The _Aedes aegypti_
mosquito spreads the dengue virus. Recurrence of the disease might cause
severe hemorrhage that can be deadly.

Defenseless against dengue
--------------------------
Dengue threatens to strike Dhaka off guard as the health ministry, health
department, and Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) are in apparent inaction to
fight a repeat of the deadly outbreak that killed 193 people on record
since 2000.
Dengue turned epidemic in 2001 and 2002. About 12 000 people have been
infected and hospitalized since 2000, the year dengue struck Bangladesh for
the 1st time. According to the control room at the health department, 136
people died of dengue in 2000, 36 in 2001, and 21 in 2002 in Dhaka. How
many people were killed last year [2003] is not known.
Dengue, [which usually] breaks out in May and rages full-blown [for the
next] 3 months, is still a major threat to public health but has been
ignored over the last 2 years. "The prevalence of dengue peaks at the
beginning and at the end of the monsoon," a DCC entomologist said.
The DCC has no surveillance and runs short of adulticide and larvicide to
spray in city wards. "Examining and purchasing chemicals takes a lot of
time, a minimum of 2 months, but the DCC has not made any decision yet, "
he said. Entomologist Manzur A Chowdhury says information on the _Aedes_
population this year is not available. The disease-control institute
carried out small-scale surveys in some DCC wards in 2001 and 2002 in the
wake of the dengue outbreak. "No more surveys have been done since," a
source in the institute said.

trend in reported cases over the last weeks.
The accumulated morbidity rate is 38.7 per 100 000 population (increased,

report on ProMED-mail (see reference below). There is a decrease of 2
states -- from 10 to 8 -- with greater incidence than the national average.
