Suspected acute haemorrhagic fever in the Republic of the Congo 13 May 2005
----------------------------------
Between 27 Apr [2005] and 11 May 2005, 9 suspected cases of acute
haemorrhagic fever have been reported in Etoumbi (8) and Mbomo (1) in
Cuvette Ouest Region. All cases have been fatal. A total of 52 contacts are
being monitored in Etoumbi and Mbomo.
The Ministry of Health, the WHO Regional Office for Africa, and Medecins
Sans Frontieres-Holland are in the field to assess the situation and to
collect clinical samples for diagnosis. These will be tested by the Centre
International de Recherches Medicales de Franceville (CIRMF), Gabon.

New outbreak of Ebola virus is feared in Congo Republic
-------------------------------------------------------
9 people have died in the Congo Republic since late April [2005] from what
appears to be an outbreak of the Ebola virus, the 2nd episode of a deadly
hemorrhagic fever to strike the region this year, a spokesman for the World
Health Organization said on Friday [13 May 2005].
The latest outbreak is taking place as the Congo Republic's southern
neighbor, Angola, battles an epidemic of Marburg virus, a hemorrhagic fever
closely related to Ebola. So far, 280 people have died in that epidemic,
which has yet to be contained [8] weeks after the virus was 1st identified.
Health officials in 2 Congolese cities already have mobilized to battle the
suspected outbreak of Ebola, which has repeatedly surfaced in central
Africa in the past 5 years. Epidemiologists are tracking 52 people who had
contact with those who died, the officials said.
"We don't have lab confirmation yet," Dick Thompson, the medical officer
for the World Health Organization, said on Friday [13 May 2005] in a
telephone interview from Geneva. "But it has all the features of an Ebola
outbreak."
Ebola and Marburg are considered to be 2 of the world's deadliest viral
diseases. Victims suffer high fevers, diarrhea, vomiting, and often severe
internal bleeding that can lead to a catastrophic drop in blood pressure.
While both diseases can be treated, about 50 to 90 per cent of the victims
in Africa die.
Health authorities in the Congo Republic have moved rapidly to investigate
and curb the disease. Mr Thompson said the quick response suggested that
the nation's health authorities were learning how to deal with such
episodes on their own.
The deaths occurred between 27 Apr [2005] and 11 May [2005] in Etoumbi and
in Mbomo, a town 440 miles north of the capital, Brazzaville, and the site
of a previous Ebola outbreak in late 2003. Mr Thompson said the 1st victims
were hunters who probably had come in contact with dead monkeys in the bush.
The Marburg epidemic in Angola has proved particularly hard to contain.
Typically, international medical experts who had spent 8 weeks battling an
epidemic of hemorrhagic fever would be preparing to leave the remaining
work in the hands of local and national authorities, according to Mr
Thompson. But the World Health Organization has no plans yet to withdraw
its team of more than 20 people from Uï¿½, the northern Angola province
that is the center of the outbreak.

[As most outbreaks and cases of Ebola hemorrhagic fever have occurred and
been treated in Africa, a blanket statement as mentioned in the above
newswire -- suggesting that there would automatically be a lower case
fatality rate if the cases occurred outside of Africa -- is based on
speculation and supposition most likely related to the observation that the
1st outbreaks of Marburg fever occurred simultaneously in Germany and the
former Yugoslavia (1967) among laboratory workers handling African green
monkeys from Uganda. There were 31 cases with 7 deaths (case fatality rate
(CFR) 23 per cent. A cluster of 3 cases were treated in South Africa (1975)
with 1 death (CFR 33 per cent). A major outbreak occurred in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (1998-2000) with 154 cases and 128 deaths (CRF 83 per
cent)(<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/marburg/factsheet/en/>).
In contrast, there was one outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever among
primates from the Philippines in a facility in Virginia, USA (1989-1992,
1996), with no human cases reported, and low pathogenicity of the virus

In the above reports there is mention of one new case having been
identified since the last ProMED-mail posting (see below). Official
confirmation of Ebola hemorrhagic fever still awaits results of laboratory
studies. - Mod.MPP]
