Subject: Outbreak sparks import ban [China]
South China Morning Post, Internet Edition, 3 Apr 97
Beijing has banned the import of pigs, cattle and sheep from Taiwan. The
import ban was issued on Tuesday by the [Chinese] Ministry of Agriculture,
the China Daily said.
The move prohibits the direct or indirect import of pigs, oxen and sheep, as
well as their by-products. It followed Taiwan's decision to reject offers
from the mainland to help fight the outbreak.
The [Chinese] ministry reiterated its willingness to supply vaccines to Taiwan.
[Some readers might remember that the Taiwanese officials traced the source
of the FMD infection to pigs smuggled into Taiwan from southern China. MHJ]
