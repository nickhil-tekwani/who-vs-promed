The Mongolia National Center for Zoonotic Disease reported on their Facebook page [https://www.facebook.com/nczd.gov/?fref=ts] of an additional suspected human bubonic plague case in western Mongolia. The case is a 37-year-old man from Tsetseg soum, Khovd province and is currently hospitalized in critical condition.

It is reported the patient ate marmot meat. Since the beginning of 2020, 13 human plague cases have been reported (9 suspect and 4 confirmed).

[Plague is caused by _Yersinia pestis_. Plague appears to be more prevalent this year (2020) in Mongolia. It is not clear that person-to-person spread has occurred.

Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a "bubo". Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream, which can occur even without a clear bubo. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of "primary" plague pneumonia. A quarantine would be required with contact tracing and even prophylactic antimicrobials if the index case or cases actually had plague pneumonia.

Plague is endemic in Mongolia. Marmots such as the Tarvaga, the Tarbagan or Mongolian marmot, _Marmota sibirica_, a large rodent related to the American woodchuck (_M. monax_), are thought to be significant zoonotic reservoirs for _Y. pestis_ in Eastern Asia. The name marmot comes from French "marmotte", from Latin _mures monti_ "mountain mouse".

While foodborne transmission of _Y. pestis_ has been described (such as Leslie T, et al. Outbreak of gastroenteritis caused by _Yersinia pestis_ in Afghanistan. Epidemiol Infect. 2011; 139(5): 728-35; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20663260), it is far more likely that the bubonic plague cases were acquired via the bites of infected fleas. - Mod.LL
