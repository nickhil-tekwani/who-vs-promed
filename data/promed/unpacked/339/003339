Flanked by close-up photographs of the enemy and maps of its movements,
Gov. Gray Davis declared war Thursday on a beetle-like insect that is
spreading the Pierce's Disease pathogen, devastating vineyards in Southern
California, and threatening the state's $33 billion wine industry. It
already has wiped out nearly a third of wine grape vineyards in the
Temecula area south of Los Angeles.
Davis, meeting with some of the top grape growers and wine makers, said he
would immediately sponsor legislation to provide $6.9 million in state
funds each year for the next two years to escalate the state's efforts
against the tiny insect - the glassy-winged sharpshooter - and would seek
another $7.1 million in federal funds. The money would be used for research
into both eradication of the bug and finding a cure for the bacterial
disease it spreads.
The insect is damaging crops by infecting plants with Pierce's Disease. The
disease is caused by a bacterium that kills plants by preventing them from
absorbing water and nutrients. Because of the bug's voracious appetite - it
consumes huge amounts of sap a day, the equivalent of a 150-pound human
drinking 4300 gallons of liquid - and its ability to travel relatively long
distances, it has the potential of spreading Pierce's Disease more
extensively than ever before, they warn.
While the disease has existed in California for a century, the
glassy-winged sharpshooter is new to the state. And it seems particularly
attracted to grapevines, according to experts. The insect was discovered in
the Temecula area in 1997, and by 1999 its impact in the area was huge,
wiping out nearly a third of local vineyards. Damage has been estimated at
$6 million, according to Bob Wynn, head of pest prevention for the
California Department of Food and Agriculture and coordinator of the
state's war on the insect.
The glassy-winged sharpshooter has infested eight Southern California
counties. A lone sharpshooter was found in a trap in Lodi, but none have
been detected since.
This month state officials began an experimental project of treating crops
in the Temecula area. The bug likes to lay its eggs in the leaves of citrus
trees. The nymphs feed on the leaves of the tree until old enough to fly
away, and infest other crops. Citrus is not susceptible to Pierce's
Disease. Last week 160 acres of citrus trees were sprayed with a "soft"
pesticide aimed at killing the glassy-winged sharpshooter without harming
beneficial insects, Wynn said. Next week, a systemic insecticide will be
applied to the ground over about 1,600 acres of citrus trees in the area in
an effort to kill the insects' young, he said.
A few Northern California growers have suggested a quarantine of some
agricultural products and ornamental plants from Southern California, but
state officials and most growers say the idea is premature because it is
unknown how the sharpshooter is travelling, whether naturally or on produce
or ornamental plant shipments. Nurseries in California have begun a
voluntary detection effort.
"California's table, raise and wine grape industries must be protected from
the insects and bacterium that have the potential to destroy portions of
that industry," the governor said.

[The bacterium that causes Pierce's Disease is _Xylella fastidiosa_.
According to Alexander Purcell, University of California (Berkeley), the
glassy-winged sharpshooter has become locally abundant in Riverside and San
Diego counties. Vineyards within a mile of citrus or avocado groves are at
greatest risk. Management of the disease includes reducing numbers of
glassy-winged sharpshooters and removal of diseased vines as soon as
possible after appearance of Pierce's Disease. - Mod.DH
