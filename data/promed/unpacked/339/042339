Rocky Mountain spotted fever - USA (Indiana): alert 2000.2934
Date: Tue, 25 Jul 2000 13:39:45 -0500
From: James Howell <Jhowell@isdh.state.in.us>

There were 62 confirmed (CDC Case Definition) RMSF cases reported to the
Indiana State Department of Health for the years 1990-1999 (mean 6.2/yr,
range 1-12). The mean age of cases was 30.4 years of age with a range of
<1 to 82 years of age. During this ten year period cases have occurred as
early as March (1) and as late as November (2), but the majority occur
during the months of May, June, and July (38,61%). To date in 2000, one
RMSF case has been confirmed. The principle vector is _Dermacentor
variablis_, a common and widely distributed tick species in Indiana.
_Amblyomma americanum_ is present in several counties in the southern and
southwestern part of the state.

[It looks like the weather pattern cited in the last posting has not
produced a larger than expected number of cases this year to date. This
thread is cut. - Mod.ES
