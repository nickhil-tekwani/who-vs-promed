Chattanooga experiencing canine influenza outbreak, some places now requiring vaccines
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Veterinarians and shelters say there is a canine influenza outbreak in Chattanooga.

This is leading to some places requiring dogs to be vaccinated before they can stay there.

The Humane Educational Society for Chattanooga says, "We've discovered through testing that the canine coughing we're seeing is specifically due to canine influenza. Unfortunately, it was brought to us through animal surrenders and we are now dealing with the aftermath."

The Humane Education Society says canine influenza spreads through:
*Direct contact.
*Coughing, barking, and sneezing.
*Contaminated objects such as clothing, kennel surfaces, bowls, collars and leashes.
*People handling and moving between infected and non-infected dogs.
*Signs range from mild to severe: persistent coughing, sneezing, nasal or eye discharge, lethargy and reduced appetite and fever.

To prevent canine influenza, HES recommends:
*Talking to your veterinarian about your dog's risk of exposure and if the canine influenza vaccine is right for them.
*Avoid exposing your dog to sick dogs,
*If there's an outbreak in your area, avoid taking your dog to places where other dogs gather.
*If your dog shows signs of illness, isolate them from other dogs and take them to the vet.
*Wash your hands after handling any dog.
*Don't share equipment or toys between sick and healthy dogs.
*HES is still conducting adoptions and say these animals deserve to have a home where they can be free from the threat of canine influenza or recover comfortably in a loving home environment.

If the dog you would like to adopt is one who has canine influenza, HES will walk you through it and give you the medication to make the pup healthy again.

Marissa Schulman is the Medical Director at Riverview Animal Hospital.

Schulman says the canine disease is spreading rapidly but there are precautions you can take.

"Keep your dog at home and maybe not board them. Maybe not go to doggy daycare or go to the dog park. It is probably not a bad idea to limit exposure," says Schulman.

Dr. Schulman says the canine influenza vaccine is on backorder. So in the meantime she recommends you call your vet to check availability.

Tuesday [4 Oct 2022] we went to Barkmore Pet Hotel & Daycare to speak with the owner Heather Frost about this outbreak.

"It's hitting so hard. It's very contagious. If your dog is not vaccinated with the 2 shot series, they're at risk of getting it", says Frost.

[It's important to note that as with the human flu vaccine, canine influenza vaccine does not reduce the risk of your dog being infected. Vaccination does reduce the risk of death/severe disease, and may reduce the duration of shedding. - Mod.JH]

She says they are requiring dogs to be vaccinated before they can be boarded at Barkmore.

Canine flu concerns cause dog event cancelations
------------------------------------------------
The Inaugural Bark in the Boro, which is an event for dogs, was set to be held at Middle Tennessee State University this weekend. However, organizers announced it will be rescheduled to allow time for the current canine flu outbreak to subside.

The canine flu is highly contagious, and it can spread through droplets in the air or by coming in contact with surfaces the germs are living on. Your dog's risk of catching it is mainly determined by where you live and your dog's lifestyle.

Gallatin animal hospital sees many sick dogs as canine flu concerns increase. Dr. Allen Craig, veterinarian at Lebanon Animal Hospital, told News 2 while he's heard the canine flu is widespread in places like Mt. Juliet and Bowling Green, Kentucky, he hasn't seen it too often in his office.

"If your dogs are around other dogs, that's where they're going to catch it," Craig said. "If your dog stays at home and does not have exposure to other dogs, then they're at a pretty insignificant risk."

Signs of the canine flu include a cough, runny nose, fever, fatigue, and sometimes loss of appetite. Elderly dogs are at a greater risk of developing pneumonia from the canine flu, according to Craig. When dogs catch the illness, the veterinarian said they often don't show signs for the 1st 5 to 7 days, but they can still spread the infection to other dogs.

The main way to protect your pup is to get them vaccinated against the canine flu, especially if they're elderly or spend time around other dogs. The H3N2 strain has caused the most trouble in Middle Tennessee, but Craig recommends vaccinating your dog against both strains of the canine flu.

["The H3N8 equine influenza virus has been recognized in horses for more than 40 years. In 2004, the H3N8 influenza virus or 'flu' appears to have 'jumped' from horses to dogs. The virus had mutated into a form known as canine influenza virus (CIV) which is highly infective for dogs. At first, veterinarians thought the H3N8 canine flu would be quite lethal. Fortunately, like the human flu virus, it kills very few healthy individuals. Since its detection in 2004, H3N8 canine influenza has been detected in most states. The disease was discovered by Dr. Cynda Crawford from the University of Florida, and she estimated the H3N8 strain kills between 1% and 5% of dogs contracting it, with most of the deaths being in dogs having serious concurrent illnesses. That's nothing to sneeze at. The 1918 Spanish flu had a mortality rate of only 2%.

"In March of 2015, a new strain of influenza in the United States was identified (H3N2) in Chicago during an outbreak of respiratory illness. Prior to this, the H3N2 strain of canine influenza had only been identified in Asia after jumping from birds to dogs. After its initial detection, cases of H3N2 influenza were reported in many states and a few provinces in Canada. The strain was even detected in a group of shelter cats which were exposed to infected dogs. A more recent outbreak was reported by the University of Florida's College of Veterinary Medicine in May 2017. By mid-June [2017], H3N2 infections had been reported in many other states, including the Carolinas, Texas, and Illinois. The severity of H3N2 may be greater than other respiratory infections, especially in those dogs with higher risk of infection. Similar to H3N8 infection, the risk of mortality with H3N2 infection is low.

"Currently, there are approved CIV vaccines in the United States and Canada. Vaccination against canine flu should be considered for any at-risk breed, dogs with heart or respiratory conditions, dogs that travel or show, and those having extensive contact with other dogs (e.g., those that are boarded, go to dog parks, shows, etc).

"The signs of canine influenza are similar to the human flu: cough, runny nose, and fever. The most common clinical sign associated with canine influenza is a cough that does not respond to antibiotic or cough suppressant therapy and lasts 10-21 days. This cough may be productive ('moist') or non-productive ('dry'), and it may be associated with reduced appetite and lethargy. The majority of dogs infected with canine influenza will display mild clinical signs. Dogs infected with the H3N2 strain of canine influenza appear to be at greater risk of developing more severe clinical signs.

"The CI virus is virtually identical to other respiratory infections such as kennel cough. In fact, many cases of CIV may be mistaken as kennel cough or other infections in the canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) complex because of these similarities. Because of the difficulty in distinguishing canine influenza from CIRD, any dog with these clinical signs should be seen by a veterinarian.

"Older dogs and dogs with heart and respiratory conditions are at particular risk for CIV. Dogs with short, flat faces (brachycephalic breeds), such as Boston terriers, boxers, Pekingese, pugs, and shih tzus, are also at higher risk."

"Due to its similarities to other respiratory infections, canine influenza cannot be diagnosed on clinical signs alone. If a veterinarian sees a dog within the 1st few days of the onset of clinical signs, a nasal swab for a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can be submitted to a veterinary diagnostic lab. If the PCR test is positive, the dog most likely has CIV. After 4 days of illness, PCR results are less likely to be accurate (there may be false-negative results). At this stage, blood testing for CIV antibodies should be performed. This type of testing, called serology, involves comparing antibody levels 2-3 weeks apart. If antibody levels rise significantly over this period, it indicates active CIV infection. Your veterinarian may also wish to run other diagnostics such as blood work and radiographs to assess the severity of infection.

"Any dog suspected of having the CIV should be tested to determine if the disease is spreading in your area. If there are confirmed canine influenza virus cases in your area, consult with your veterinarian and consider vaccinating your dog."

"It is important to note the CIV vaccine cannot completely prevent the disease. It may, however, reduce the severity and duration of clinical signs associated with infection. This is especially important in at-risk dogs and to help reduce the spread of outbreaks.

"Talk to your veterinarian to determine if vaccinating against canine influenza is right for your dog.

"As with nearly all viral infections, treatment is largely supportive. It is important that your pet be kept in a warm, dry area away from other dogs, fed a high-quality diet, and kept well hydrated during illness. Good nutrition and husbandry are crucial in ensuring that dogs mount an adequate immune response and can help promote faster recovery. Dogs affected with a mild form of canine influenza will often develop a secondary bacterial upper respiratory infection. These dogs typically have a thick green mucous discharge from their nose and benefit from broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. Dogs that develop pneumonia may require hospitalization, intravenous fluids and medications, and potent broad-spectrum antibiotics. Most dogs fully recover from canine influenza within 2-3 weeks. It is important to consult with your veterinarian to determine the best course of treatment. Dogs exposed to the virus should be isolated for 4 weeks to prevent further spread.

"Virtually 100% of dogs exposed to CIV will become infected. For this reason, it is important that owners of dogs diagnosed with the virus keep them away from other dogs. This includes trips to the groomer or dog parks and contact with other dogs during walks and in kennels. Clothing, equipment, floors, and hands should be thoroughly cleaned with soap and water after contact with any dog with signs of respiratory illness." (https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/canine-influenza-the-dog-flu)

Owners should heed the warning and get their pets vaccinated. Activities with other dogs around such as play dates or visits to the groomers, dog parks, or boarding facilities make it critical for the owner to get their dog vaccinated. Prevention is much easier on the pet, the pet parent, and the finances of the pet parent. - Mod.TG
