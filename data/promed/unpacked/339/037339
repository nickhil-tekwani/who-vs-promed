The number of patients who died due to the outbreak of an unknown disease in Haladikunda [Haldikund] village under Temrupalli Panchayat of Mathili block increased to 6 after the death of [MM] of the village.

After complaining of fever and swelling of hands and legs, [MM] was rushed to the hospital. However, he succumbed on the way.

Mathili Community Health Centre doctor Amiya Kumar Swain confirmed 6 deaths while the villagers are alleging 11 deaths in the last 10 days.

Five of them have died of kidney disease. On Friday [9 Sep 2022], a special team reached the village and investigated the situation, said the doctor.

However, 15 people have been advised to go to the hospital. Four critically ill have already been admitted to the hospital.

According to the information, an unidentified disease is reportedly taking many lives in the district. Affected patients are complaining of sudden swelling of hands and legs following high fever leading to the deaths in 3 to 4 days.

Sources said instead of getting treated at the hospital, the locals prefer getting treated by village quacks, which is said to have worsened the situation.

Notably, Mathili police on Friday [9 Sep 2022] arrested one [NM] after a complaint was lodged by Haldikund villagers against him, allegedly for the death of a villager who was getting treated under him. [NM], a native of Salimi village, is allegedly a practitioner of quackery.

An unidentified disease has claimed 6 lives including 5 men and 1 woman and affected more than 10 people within 10 days at Haldikund [Haladikunda] village under Mathili block of Malkangiri district in Odisha.

According to reports, the symptoms of the unidentified disease include swelling of legs followed by fever. The infected persons are not going to the hospitals for treatment. Rather, they are depending on witchcraft to find cure to the unknown disease.

After being informed about the incident, a medical team was sent to the village to attend the patients, but the villagers refused treatment from the medical team.

The medical team, however, is examining the sample of water and food consumed by the people from the affected area.

Meanwhile, [NM], a fake quack, has been nabbed by the local police for duping money from the villagers in the name of treatment. Besides, police forwarded him to the court after registering a case against him.

[3] Odisha state, India (Malkangiri district): chronic alcoholism
Date: Mon 12 Sep 2022
Source: The New Indian Express [edited]
https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2022/sep/12/chronic-alcoholism-causes6-deaths-in-haldikund-in-odisha-2497399.html


Chronic alcoholism is the reason behind 6 deaths in Haldikund [Haladikunda] village of Malkangiri's Mathili block. Malkangiri Collector Vishal Singh said the 6 villagers had suffered damage to kidneys and liver due to a rise in creatinine levels, which was a result of chronic alcoholism.

On Sunday [11 Sep 2022], chief district medical officer (CDMO) Prafulla Nanda accompanied by a health team visited Haldikund and took stock of the situation.

"During my visit, I found that one [RB] (50), who succumbed on 6 Sep [2022], used to feed liquor to her 4-year-old son [SB] regularly. [SB] has also developed swelling on his legs and hands like his mother," Nanda told TNIE.

The health team examined 10 villagers, including [SB], who have swelling on their legs and hands. All of them were referred to the district headquarters hospital for further evaluation and treatment, the CDMO informed.

Sources said a number of villagers are suffering from chronic alcoholism in Haldikund. Flourishing illicit country liquor manufacturing units in Haldikund and the reluctance of villagers to visit doctors because of their belief in superstition have aggravated the situation.

Excise officials had raided the village on Saturday [10 Sep 2022] and seized illicit country liquor. After testing, it was found that the liquor's pH value was 5, which was acidic and, hence, not suitable for consumption, Nanda said, adding that the villagers are mixing battery powder, urea, and ammonia to manufacture the illicit liquor.

"While creatinine level is rising in villagers due to consumption of the illicit liquor, the albumin level is decreasing, and the imbalance is causing damage to the kidney," said the CDMO.

The blood test reports of 43 villagers revealed that creatinine level was high, which is the reason for the damage to the kidney and liver.

The health team collected a litre of liquor from the village, which will be sent for further test, Nanda added. Mathili IIC Surya Prakash Nayak said police are trying to locate the liquor manufacturing units operating in the village.

A day after Malkangiri reported death of 5 villagers due to an unknown disease, 3 persons of Kandikiguda village in Boipariguda block of Koraput district on Saturday [10 Sep 2022] succumbed after developing similar symptoms, like swelling of feet, hands, and face. Soon, a 7-member team of the Health and Family Welfare department rushed to the village to take stock of the situation.

Sources said, 7 days back, a few residents of the village had developed swelling in feet, hands, and face. The affected villagers received treatment from local quacks and later from health staff, but 2 of them succumbed to the disease.

On Friday [9 Sep 2022], some villagers took an affected person to Boipariguda community health centre (CHC), and he was later shifted to Jeypore district headquarters hospital after his condition deteriorated. He died while he was being taken to Koraput MCH for further treatment at night.

The village is surrounded by Ramgiri forests, and the local CHC is around 50 km [31 mi] away. Worse, the road connecting the village to the block headquarters is damaged. Sources said 10 more persons are suffering from the unidentified disease, and all of them have been taking the help of quacks for treatment. The exact number of people suffering from the disease, however, can only be ascertained after the health department conducts a survey.

Koraput CDMO Arun Padhi said the cause of the deaths can be ascertained only after the disease is identified and the team submits its report. He said 2 more medical teams from Boipariguda and Ramgiri have also been rushed to the affected village. The village, with a population of 194, has 45 households. Last year in August and September [2021], 6 people from the village had died after developing similar symptoms.

Death toll in Malkangiri village goes up to 6
---------------------------------------------------
One more person succumbed to an unknown disease in Haldikund [Haladikunda] village under Mathili block on Saturday [10 Sep 2022], taking the toll to 6. The deceased was identified as [IM] (40). A medical team comprising medicine specialists and microbiologists visited the village and collected blood and urine samples from 43 locals. Panic has gripped the village after the unknown disease claimed 6 lives in the last 15 days. CDMO Praful Nanda told TNIE that [IM] was missing for the last 3 days and hiding in a village disari's house. Samples of alcohol consumed by the deceased have also been collected from the village and sent for test. "The villagers are not willing to visit the hospital and doctors. I will visit the village on Sunday [11 Sep 2022]," he said. Meanwhile, Mathili IIC Surya Prakash Nayak blamed the villagers' belief in superstition for the incident. "The police will launch a special drive to eradicate superstition from the area," he added.

[While this toxin or disease is undiagnosed at the moment, there are a few things that have not been addressed in these articles. The most recent article [item 3] reports kidney and liver disease with elevated creatinine levels and chronic alcoholism. The generalized swelling described in these patients could thus reflect nephrotic syndrome and other consequences of kidney and liver failure including malnutrition. However, the acute cluster of cases, occasional reports of fever, and involvement of preschool and school-age children would not be characteristic of chronic ethanol abuse. The articles do not indicate a time frame of illness. How fast did the clinical signs appear and how long until death?

Illegal homemade liquor in India may contain battery acid (sulfuric acid) and other harmful substances. I also wonder if the acute toxicity could be due to consumption of methanol or ethylene glycol instead of ethyl alcohol. We are not told if the liquor contained methanol or if methanol was ingested. There is no mention of vomiting, and generally with ethylene glycol toxic ingestion there is often accompanying vomiting.

It would be helpful, perhaps, to know what these individuals were treated with by their local quack. This article does not indicate if the local quack, or medicine man, so to speak, caused symptoms to worsen, or perhaps the individual seemed to recover before succumbing.

It is also concerning that a cluster of similar cases has appeared in the Koraput district of Odisha [item 4], which is about 120 km [75 mi] from Malkangiri district. In addition, in August [2022], several people died from an unknown disease in the Kalimela area of the Malkangiri district, and some sources said the unidentified disease is spreading from the Mathili area. This makes me wonder if perhaps this is an industrial chemical in the water.

Hopefully a more thorough investigation will shed some light on this situation. ProMED would appreciate any additional information from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.TG
