Today [19 May 2021], the Florida Department of Health in Orange County (DOH-Orange) advises residents there has been an increase in mosquito-borne disease activity in areas of Orange County.

Several sentinel chickens in one flock have tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) infection. The risk of transmission to humans has increased, however, chicken flocks do not correlate to the risk of EEEV infections to humans.

Orange County Mosquito Control and DOH-Orange continue surveillance and prevention efforts. The Department reminds residents and visitors to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes and to take basic precautions to help limit exposure.

To protect yourself from mosquitoes, you should remember to "Drain and Cover": DRAIN standing water to stop mosquitoes from multiplying.
- Drain water from garbage cans, house gutters, buckets, pool covers, coolers, toys, flower pots, or any other containers where sprinkler or rain water has collected.
- Discard old tires, drums, bottles, cans, pots and pans, broken appliances, and other items that aren't being used.
- Empty and clean birdbaths and pet water bowls at least once or twice a week.
- Protect boats and vehicles from rain with tarps that don't accumulate water.
- Maintain swimming pools in good condition and appropriately chlorinated.
- Empty plastic swimming pools when not in use.

COVER skin with clothing or repellent.
- Clothing: wear shoes, socks, and long pants and long sleeves. This type of protection may be necessary for people who must work in areas where mosquitoes are present.
- Repellent: apply mosquito repellent to bare skin and clothing.
- Always use repellents according to the label. Repellents with DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, 2-undecanone, and IR3535 are effective.
- Use mosquito netting to protect children younger than 2 months old.

Tips on repellent use:
- Always read label directions carefully for the approved usage before you apply a repellent. Some repellents are not suitable for children.
- Products with concentrations of up to 30 percent DEET (N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide) are generally recommended. Other US Environmental Protection Agency-approved repellents contain picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, 2-undecanone, or IR3535. These products are generally available at local pharmacies. Look for active ingredients to be listed on the product label.
- Apply insect repellent to exposed skin, or onto clothing, but not under clothing.
- In protecting children, read label instructions to be sure the repellent is age-appropriate. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), mosquito repellents containing oil of lemon eucalyptus or para-menthane-diol should not be used on children under the age of 3 years. DEET is not recommended for children younger than 2 months old.
- Avoid applying repellents to the hands of children. Adults should apply repellent first to their own hands and then transfer it to the child's skin and clothing.
-If additional protection is necessary, apply a permethrin repellent directly to your clothing. Again, always follow the manufacturer's directions.

COVER doors and windows with screens to keep mosquitoes out of your house.
- Repair broken screening on windows, doors, porches, and patios.

For more information on what repellent is right for you, consider using the Environmental Protection Agency's search tool to help you choose skin-applied repellent products:

The Department continues to conduct statewide surveillance for mosquito-borne illnesses, including West Nile virus infections, eastern equine encephalitis, St Louis encephalitis, malaria, chikungunya, and dengue. Residents of Florida are encouraged to report dead birds via the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission's site - (http://legacy.myfwc.com/bird/default.asp).

[EEEV is endemic in Florida and cases in horses and occasionally people occur annually. There has already been an equine case this year (2021) in Volusia County, Florida. As the report above indicates, the finding of EEEV infected sentinel chickens indicates that the virus is being actively transmitted currently in Orange County, Florida. Residents in or visitors to the county should heed the preventive measures indicated above. These measures are prudent not only in Florida but elsewhere in the eastern and mid-western US states where the virus has been transmitted historically. The 2020 transmission season was particularly active with cases in both human and equine animals. Although there is not a commercially available vaccine for humans, there is one for equine animals and owners should have vaccinated their animals already. - Mod.TY
