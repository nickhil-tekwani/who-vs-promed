The Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks (KDWP) has announced the
1st confirmed case of chronic wasting disease (CWD) found in a deer
taken during a 2010 deer season. The animal was the only one of 90
tested by KDWP as of 8 Dec 2010 to show a "presumptive positive"
result. [Likely this statement should say: The animal was the only
one to show a presumptive positive of the 90 tested by KDWP, as of 8
Dec 2010.] Samples of deer tissue taken by KDWP are sent to the
K-State Diagnostic Veterinary Lab in Manhattan for preliminary
testing. If the K-State lab determines the sample is a presumptive
positive, the sample is then sent to the National Veterinary Services
Lab in Ames, Iowa, for confirmation.

This deer was a 3 1/2-year-old male taken in Decatur County by an
archery hunter on 7 Nov 2010. Because samples from the January
whitetail antlerless only seasons have yet to be collected, complete
results of testing won't be available until March 2011. Last year,
2738 animals were tested for CWD, including 17 elk, 289 mule deer,
and 2428 white-tailed deer, and 4 unknown species. Of those samples,
15 were confirmed positive.

Annual testing is part of an ongoing effort by KDWP to monitor the
prevalence and spread of CWD. The fatal disease was 1st detected in a
wild deer taken in Cheyenne County in 2005. 3 infected deer were
taken in Decatur County in 2007, 10 tested positive in 2008, and 15
in 2009, all in northwest Kansas.

CWD is a member of the group of diseases called transmissible
spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). Other diseases in this group
include scrapie in sheep and goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE or Mad Cow Disease) in cattle, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in
people. CWD is a progressive, fatal disease that results in small
holes developing in the brain, giving it a sponge-like appearance
under the microscope. An animal may carry the disease without outward
indication but in the later stages, signs may include behavioral
changes such as decreased interactions with other animals,
listlessness, lowering of the head, weight loss, repetitive walking
in set patterns, and a lack of response to humans. Anyone who
discovers a sick or suspect deer should contact the nearest KDWP office.

There is no vaccine or other biological method that prevents the
spread of CWD. However, there is no evidence that CWD in the natural
environment poses a risk to humans or livestock. Still, precautions
should be taken. Hunters are advised not to eat meat from animals
known to be infected, and common sense precautions are advised when
field dressing and processing meat from animals taken in areas where
CWD is found. More information on CWD can be found on KDWP's website,
<http://www.kdwp.state.ks.us> or at the Chronic Wasting Disease
Alliance website, <http://www.cwd-info.org>.

[It is likely that we will see more reports of CWD in several states.
The fall hunting season has either finished or is winding up shortly.
This does not seem to represent an expansion of the disease but
rather a notification that the disease has not disappeared. - Mod.TG]
