Montpellier Cedex 5, France. Plant Dis. 88:681, 2004; published on-line as
D-2004-0401-01N, 2004. Accepted for publication 17 Mar 2004.
In June 2003, symptoms of stunting and leaf curling resembling symptoms of
tomato leaf curl disease, as well as reductions in yields, were observed on
tomato plants in the western (Combani and Kahani) and eastern (Dembeni,
Kaoueni, and Tsararano) regions of Mayotte, a French island in the Comoros
Archipelago located in the northern part of the Mozambique Channel.
The whitefly, _Bemisia tabaci_ (_Gennadius_), was observed colonizing
tomato plants and other vegetable crops at low levels. Overall, 13 leaf
samples with symptoms were collected from tomato plants among the 5 regions
and tested for the presence of begomoviruses using a PCR assay with 2 sets
of degenerate primers designed to amplify 2 regions of the A component of
begomoviruses.
Primers MP16 and MP82 amplify an approximately 500-bp fragment located
between the intergenic conserved nonanucleotide sequence and the first 200
bp of the coat protein (CP) gene (2). Primers AV494 and AC1048 amplify the
approximately 550-bp core region of the CP gene (3). 6 leaf samples, one
from Combani, 3 from Dembeni, and 2 from Kahani, gave a PCR product of the
expected size with both sets of primers. No PCR products were obtained with
degenerate primers designed for begomovirus DNA B or beta.
The approximately 500- and 550-bp PCR products from one sample each of
Combani (EMBL Accession Nos. AJ620912 and AJ620915, respectively), Dembeni
(EMBL Accession Nos. AJ620911 and AJ620914, respectively), and Kahani (EMBL
Accession Nos. AJ620913 and AJ620916, respectively) were sequenced. For the
489-bp sequences obtained with the MP16/MP82 primer set, the 3 isolates had
90 to 95 percent nucleotide identity (DNAMAN; Lynnon BioSoft, Quebec).
The most significant sequence alignments (NCBI and BLAST) were with
begomoviruses; 80-83 percent nucleotide identity was obtained with the
Tomato yellow leaf curl Morondava virus (TYLCMV) isolates from Madagascar
(EMBL Accession Nos. AJ422123 and AJ422124), 80 to 82% nucleotide identity
was obtained with the South African cassava mosaic virus (SACMV) isolates
(GenBank and EMBL Accession Nos. AF155806 and AJ422132), and 79-81 percent
nucleotide identity was obtained with the East African cassava mosaic
Malawi virus (EMBL Accession No. AJ006460). For the 522-bp sequences
obtained with the AV494/AC1048 primer set, 95 to 97% nucleotide
identity was shown between the 3 isolates.
The most significant sequence alignments were also with begomoviruses;
TYLCMV isolate Morondava (EMBL Accession No. AJ422125) with 86-88 percent
nucleotide identity, Tomato yellow leaf curl virus isolates (GenBank and
EMBL Accession Nos. AF105975, AJ489258, AB014346, AF024715, AF071228, and
X76319) with 86-87 percent nucleotide identity, and SACMV isolate M12 (EMBL
Accession No. AJ422132) with 85-86 percent nucleotide identity.
According to the current taxonomic criteria for the provisional
classification of a new begomovirus species, nucleotide sequence identity
in the core region of the CP <90 percent (1), the tomato begomovirus from
Mayotte is a new species and is provisionally named Tomato leaf curl
Mayotte virus.

[The provisional designation of Tomato leaf curl Mayotte virus leaves room
for further characterization of the virus and a final decision of the
International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses regarding its taxonomy.
The agricultural sector on Mayotte is divided into subsistence farming and
farming for export. Subsistence farming, which provides the staples making
up 75 percent of the islanders' diet, consists of coconuts, cassava,
bananas and rice. Small quantities of fish and meat are also consumed.
Mayotte is not self-sufficient and must import a large portion of its food
requirements, mainly from France. Exports are mainly ylang-ylang (perfume
essence), vanilla, copra, coconuts, coffee, and cinnamon. - Mod.DH]
