EU acts to contain bluetongue outbreak
---------------------------------------------
Europe has introduced measures to halt the spread of the bluetongue virus,
which can be fatal to sheep. In the Netherlands, Luxembourg and large areas
of Belgium and Germany, an export ban is now in place for cows, sheep and
goats, so the Netherlands is no longer the only country with a stringent
policy on bluetongue. It should be emphasized that bluetongue is not
dangerous to humans.
On Monday [21 Aug 2006], European agricultural experts imposed a ban on the
transport of cows, sheep and goats within a radius of 20 km around farms
where bluetongue has been diagnosed. In other words, the animals are not
allowed to leave the farms. The export ban is in effect over a radius of
150 km around the infected farms. In this area, animals can be taken to
slaughterhouses under strict security regulations, but may not be exported
abroad.
The export ban will initially apply for one week. This is to give experts
the opportunity to resolve a number of questions surrounding the outbreak
of bluetongue. For example, it's still not clear which variant of the virus
is involved, which makes it impossible to find a suitable vaccine. They
also want to know how a disease previously only known in southern Europe
managed to reach northwest Europe in the 1st place.
What is known at present is that a family of small mosquito-like flies,
known as biting midges or no-see-ums, transmit the virus by sucking blood
from an infected animal and biting a healthy one.
Stringent measures are needed now that the virus has spread to the
countries surrounding the Netherlands, with bluetongue now having been
diagnosed on farms in Belgium and Germany.
These measures are nothing new in the Netherlands. Late last week, as soon
as the disease was identified, Dutch Agriculture Minister Cees Veerman
imposed a nationwide export ban for sheep, goats and cows. He emphasized
how important it was that other countries should not lose confidence in the
quality of Dutch livestock.
Neighboring countries did not adopt the same policy, although the 1st
incidence of bluetongue was at a sheep farm in the far south of the
Netherlands in Kerkrade, near the border with Belgium and Germany. This
meant that sheep, cows and goats were allowed into the Netherlands from
Belgium and Germany but not in the opposite direction, despite the fact
that the chance of infection in those countries was just as great.
The Dutch farmers' and growers' organization LTO was disappointed by these
measures and pointed out that farmers would lose a great deal of money if
they were unable to the export their livestock. The LTO estimates that the
ban on exporting cattle alone represents losses of 5 million euros [USD 6.4
million] a week. Once again, the organization complained, the Netherlands
was falling over itself to make a good impression in Europe. A number of
politicians also thought Mr. Veerman had gone too far.
Now that other EU member states have also taken steps against bluetongue,
Minister Veerman looks to have been vindicated. But not everyone agrees.
The livestock exporting firm Nammen Schaap comments:
"It indicates that the minister was initially too strict with the sector.
In a way, he has been reined in a little. We know now that we'll have to
take it easy for a week, but there's a real chance that in a week's time,
exports can get back to normal again."
In any case, the nationwide export ban doesn't seem to have been such a bad
idea, now that more possible cases have been reported in Woerden and Sneek,
in the center and north of the Netherlands [see item 3 further].
Minister Veerman can understand the farmers' frustration, but stands by his
policy:
"I understand it's disappointing for some people, but on the other hand, we
know you can't be cautious enough when it comes to animal diseases. We're
talking about 4 days now that exports have been halted. Let's hope the
reports from Sneek and Woerden are false alarms. And don't forget, the
European Commission has given us discretion to lift the export ban in the
course of the week."
For now, Dutch farmers will just have to pray that cold weather comes as
soon as possible. That will kill the midges and mean the disease will have
been defeated in a purely natural way, for the time being.

Bluetongue detected for the 1st time in Northern Europe
-----------------------------------------------
Dutch, Belgian and German Authorities have officially notified the World
Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) of the occurrence of an outbreak of
bluetongue in sheep on their territory. The notification reports are
available on the OIE website:
<http://www.oie.int>.
According to the 1st report sent by the Dutch on 18 Aug 2006, the outbreak
affected a farm in the province of Limburg. Bluetongue was confirmed by
laboratory investigations. The source of the infection is currently under
investigation.
Intensive surveillance activities conducted by Dutch as well as Belgian and
German authorities revealed additional affected farms in proximity to the
index case.
Dutch, as well as Belgian and German authorities have taken classical
disease control measures, such as zoning and movement control and
continuous surveillance within the country. Further screening will be
continued to determine the extent of the outbreaks.
Bluetongue is an insect-borne viral disease to which all species of
ruminants are susceptible. The disease poses no danger to human health. It
was 1st described in South Africa, where it has probably been endemic in
wild ruminants from antiquity, but has since been recognized in most
countries in the tropics and sub-tropics. The global distribution of the
disease comprising the endemic areas of bluetongue has traditionally been
accepted to be between the latitudes of approximately 50oN and 35oS. [see
comment]. Aside from the endemic areas, since 1999, there have been reports
of outbreaks of bluetongue in Greece, Italy, France (Corsica) and Spain
(Balearic Islands). Cases also occurred in Europe in Bulgaria, Croatia,
Macedonia, Kosova and Yugoslavia (see OIE website).
Bluetongue occurs mostly during periods of high temperature and rainfall
and usually disappears with the 1st frost or severe cold weather.
The 1st occurrence of the disease in the Netherlands signifies the most
northern locality where the disease has ever been diagnosed.
An emerging disease is defined as a new infection resulting from the
evolution or change of an existing pathogen or parasite resulting in a
change of host range, vector, pathogenicity or strain. Occurring for the
1st time in the northern part of the European hemisphere, bluetongue may be
considered as an emerging disease in this area.
Globalization, the change in weather patterns, and the increase in speed
and volume of international transport, as well as passenger travel, are
known factors that could favor the spread of pathogens and the emergence of
disease.
The rapid detection and response as well as the excellent collaboration
demonstrated by the veterinary authorities in the Netherlands, Germany and
Belgium during this emerging disease have been crucial for the containment
of spread and the development of all disease control measures.
Although the source of infection of this outbreak is still under
investigation, the OIE highlights the importance of having effective
veterinary services. The ability to detect early and respond rapidly to an
unexpected event such as this is dependent upon the effectiveness of a
national surveillance system and transparency in reporting. Veterinary
services are guarantors of animal health and, by association with zoonotic
diseases, public health.

[Until 1998, BTV strains have been identified in many tropical and
temperate areas of the world from a latitude of approximately 40oN (or,
according to some investigators, 42oN) to 35oS. The disease has since
spread northwards, the most northerly affected location (to the best
knowledge of this moderator), prior to the current incursion into the
Netherlands being reported by Yugoslavia in the region of Sebac (44o43'N)
in September 2002.
There is, however, one exception: occasional incursions of bluetongue have
occurred in the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia, Canada, since 1976.
The last official identification of BTV there was notified to the OIE in
October-November 1998, when BTV11 was isolated from 2 bovines out of a
sentinel herd of 7. Previously, incursions were detected in the same
location in late August 1987 and in September 1988. The site is situated 16
km north of 49oN (which is the border with the USA; see map at
<http://www.winesnw.com/images/BC_MainOkanaganMap.gif>).
The Okanagan Valley has been defined as a separate zone within Canada so
that the rest of Canada can maintain bluetongue-free status according to
international standards. - Mod.AS]

Source: Letter of the Dutch Minister of Agriculture, Nature and Food
Safety, Dr. C.P. Veerman, to the parliament, 22 Aug 2006 [excerpts,
translated from Dutch, edited]
<http://www9.minlnv.nl/servlet/page?_pageid=106&_dad=portal30&_schema=PORTAL30&p_item_id=129707>

This is an update of the bluetongue situation further to a previous letter
of 18 Aug 2006.
Up to this moment [Tue 22 Aug 2006], bluetongue has been confirmed on
almost 20 Dutch farms. These include sheep as well as cattle farms, all
within the 20-km zone established on 18 Aug 2006 in south Netherlands.
In addition, there are several [other] suspected farms where, momentarily,
investigations are being carried out by the Food and Consumer Product
Safety Authority (VWA). This relates, in addition to farms in south
Netherlands, also to one sheep farm in the vicinity of Sneek and suspected
cattle on a [pre-export] collecting enterprise [farm] in Woerden. The
initial lab results of samples from the sheep farm in Sneek, tested by CIDC
[Central Institute for Animal Disease Control], Lelystad, are not
unambiguous; new samples will be tested by CIDC as well as by the European
reference laboratory at Pirbright (UK). No results are yet available from
the cattle in Woerden.
Tracing-back investigations have revealed that previous contacts might have
taken place between the Woerden farm and the infected area in south
Netherlands. There are no indications on such contacts relating to the
suspected sheep farm in Sneek. Final lab results from both farms are
expected within a few days.
In my previous letter, I have explained to have banned exports in wait for
the results of the investigations into possible spread of the virus into
other parts of the Netherlands. The fact that there are suspected cases in
northern areas underlines the importance of the said steps. The European
Commission as well has regarded this measure as reasonable.
In view of the consequences of this measure for the exporting sector, great
efforts are being made to obtain the information which might enable
reconsidering the export ban as early as possible. In case further spread
to the north is not confirmed and no extension of the infected zone is
observed, the export ban will be terminated at the earliest. Such a
decision is also dependent upon the results of the rapid surveillance
activities ("quickscan") for the presence of the virus in sheep and cattle,
undertaken in northern territories, and the tracing-back investigations.
The decision on the matter might be expected before the end this week.
Alongside the tracing-back investigations and the contemplated rapid
virological surveillance ("quickscan"), efforts are invested in the
performance of the obligatory, extensive epidemiological survey. This
includes studies into the distribution of the BT vectors (_Culicoides_
species) in the Netherlands and the rate of their infection. The survey is
carried out by our own investigators assisted by bluetongue experts from Italy.

The Dutch decision to voluntarily suspend all exports of ruminants upon the
initial diagnosis of bluetongue, in wait for final diagnosis --
particularly subtyping -- and for the results of the rapidly implemented
epidemiological surveillance to evaluate the route and extent of
transmission, deserves to be highly praised. It is helpful in preventing
possible spread to target markets, enables the timely application of
additional precautionary measures and safeguards the future and good name
of exported Dutch livestock and products.
Today, 23 Aug 2006, the permission to export ruminant sperma, ovi and
embryos from the BT-affected areas in the Netherlands has been renewed by
the ministry, provided they had been derived prior to 1 May 2006.
Results of the initiated Dutch surveillance, and the outcome of pending
laboratory investigations -- mainly in the reference laboratory, and
particularly regarding the serotyping of the causal agent -- are urgently
anticipated. - Mod.AS]

Bluetongue prevention measures stepped up
-----------------------------------------------
The EU today [21 Aug 2006] agreed to trade restrictions to control the
spread of bluetongue, following positive laboratory test results for the
disease. All exports of cattle, sheep and deer from Belgium and the
affected regions of the Netherlands and Germany will be prevented. In
addition, the countries have imposed Protection Zones and Surveillance
Zones around the infected farms.
Bluetongue does not affect humans but is highly infectious in sheep. The
virus is known to occur in Mediterranean EU countries, but it is thought
that the warm weather this summer [2006] has allowed the biting midges,
which transmit the disease, to survive further north.
Defra has also announced today [21 Aug 2006] testing and additional
surveillance on all recent imports from affected countries into the UK.
Debby Reynolds, Chief Veterinary Officer for the UK has urged sheep and
cattle keepers to remain vigilant for the signs of the disease, and take
biosecurity measures.
She said: "These cases of bluetongue are a significant development for
farming in North West Europe. Anyone who keeps sheep, cattle, deer and
goats should be on the alert for abnormal behavior or illness and report it
to the State Veterinary Service. There is also an obligation to report
recent imports of animals to the UK. "This is normally considered to be a
disease which mainly affects sheep, but, unusually, we have received
reports of cattle displaying signs of illness."
Notes to editors
The disease is characterized by fever that may last for several days.
Increased respiration and hyperemia of the lips, mucous linings of the
mouth and nose and eyelids, accompanied by excess salivation and frothing,
follow. Nasal discharges are common. There is sometimes edema (abnormal
swelling) of the head and neck. The hyperemia and edema may result in
lameness. Animals can lose condition rapidly, including muscle
degeneration. Infection during pregnancy may result in abortions and
congenital abnormalities.
