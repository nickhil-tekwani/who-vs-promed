[The location of the outbreak can be seen on the interactive map included in the OIE report at the source URL above.

"African horse sickness (AHS) is caused by a virus of the family _Reoviridae_ of the genus _Orbivirus_. There are 9 antigenically distinct serotypes of AHS virus (AHSV) identified by virus neutralization, but some cross-reaction has been observed between 1 and 2, 3 and 7, 5 and 8, and 6 and 9. No cross-reactions with other known orbiviruses have been observed.

AHS is endemic in the central tropical regions of Africa, from where it spreads regularly to Southern Africa and occasionally to Northern Africa. All serotypes of AHS occur in eastern and southern Africa. Only AHS serotype 9, 4 and 2 have been found in North and West Africa from where they occasionally spread into countries surrounding the Mediterranean.

A few outbreaks have occurred outside Africa in the Near and Middle East (1959-63), Spain (1966, 1987- 90), Portugal (1989), Yemen (1997) and the Cape Verde Islands (1999). But recent northward expansion of the main African vector (Afro-Asiatic species _C. imicola_) and bluetongue virus into the Mediterranean Basin of Europe now threatens that region and beyond to AHS" http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/AFRICAN_HORSE_SICKNESS.pdf.

In May 2014, Mozambique reported 3 outbreaks of AHS in the province of Maputo (where the current outbreak is located) - see posting 20140509.2461397. According to the final report, the event was resolved on 30 Sep 2014. The serotype was not typified. The event summary and map are available at, http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=15212. - Mod.CRD
