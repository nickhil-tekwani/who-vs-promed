Canterbury Public Health officials are urging the community to get vaccinated after a 3rd case of measles is confirmed in Canterbury.

An 18-year-old woman is the 3rd case in a fortnight to be diagnosed with the highly contagious virus.

The woman visited Christchurch hospital's emergency department on Sat [10 Feb] and Sun [11 Feb] so anyone who was in the waiting room at the weekend is urged to contact their GP's for vaccination.

Mayor Beng Climaco has declared a measles outbreak in Zamboanga City in view of the 1343 percent increase in measles cases recorded from [1 Jan-1 Feb this 2018].

This, based on Executive Order [EO] BC 333-2018 issued 9 Feb 2018 per recommendation of the City Health Office [CHO].

The EO directs the CHO through Officer-in-charge Dr Dulce Amor Miravite to "institute, undertake and implement preventive and proactive measures to effectively address" the outbreak.

The CHO has recorded 101 suspected measles cases during the 1st 4 months of the year [2018] representing a 1343 percent increase in the number of cases as compared to the same period last year [2017]. The number of cases is above the outbreak threshold level, thus, the declaration.

Dr Miravite said 49 percent of those with suspected measles were males while 51 percent were females. At least 34 of the 101 cases belong to the 1-5 years age group.

The highest proportion of cases have no history of immunization, it was noted.

Mayor Climaco said the Local Government Code mandates every local government unit to promote the health and safety as well as to preserve the comfort and convenience of their inhabitants, "thus the need to issue an order declaring a Measles Outbreak in the city.

Meanwhile, Dr Miravite said the CHO in partnership with the DOH [Department of Health] would intensify measles immunization activities to children aged 6 months-59 months starting 19 Feb 2018, through the different health centers in the city.

Aside from the catch up immunization, the CHO is also intensifying advocacy to encourage parents to submit their children to immunization amidst the Dengvaxia scare.

The CHO suspects 2 possible reasons for the increase in measles cases in the city, 1) the cases recorded were obtained in other places, and 2) there is low immunity in Zamboanga City.

Barangay [smallest administrative division in the Philippines] Sangali recorded the most number of measles cases at 16, followed by Calarian with 10 cases; Arena Blanco with 6 cases; Busay (Sacol Island), San Jose Cawa-cawa, Sta Catalina, and Sta Maria with 4 cases each; Camino Nuevo, San Roque, Sinunuc, and Tumaga Tumaga with 3 cases each; Canelar, Cawit, Guiwan, Lumbangan, Lunzuran, Mercedes, Putik, and Tugbungan with 2 cases each. Another 24 other barangays listed with 1 case each, according to the CHO.

The ARS [Regional Health Agency] recommends that all néo-aquitains check their vaccination status.

According to the last count on [6 Feb 2018], the measles epidemic has infected 213 people in Nouvelle-Aquitaine region since the beginning of November 2017, mainly in [the departments of] Vienne and Gironde.

The ARS also reports that 57 patients were hospitalized, more than a quarter of those infected.

"90 percent of cases of measles were not or were poorly vaccinated (2 doses are necessary to be protected)" says the regional health agency, which encourages all New Aquitaine to verify their vaccination [status].

Since the beginning of the epidemic, [cases of] patients have been reported on the Bordeaux [Gironde department] campus and then in primary schools in the city.

Poitou-Charente, several people were infected in Poitiers [Vienne department], and in Limoges [Haute-Vienne department], a case has been recently confirmed.

"Since November 2017, the departments of Gironde and Vienne have been the most affected, but isolated cases of measles can appear anywhere and initiate an epidemic," says the ARS, which also reports some cases in Charente-Maritime, Deux-Sèvres, Dordogne, Landes, and Pyrénées-Atlantiques.

[4] France (Poitiers, Vienne): fatality

Health authorities in south western France, which has been hit by a measles epidemic, have reminded the public of the dangers of the virus after a young woman died this week.

The young woman died in hospital in the city of Poitiers, in the Vienne department [New, the regional health authority (ARS) in Bordeaux announced on Tue [13 Feb 2018].

According to hospital authorities the 32-year-old woman had not been vaccinated against the virus. She was admitted to hospital on [1 Feb 2018] and quickly transferred to intensive care but not did survive.

The Nouvelle-Aquitaine region of western and south western France has been hit by an epidemic of measles since November [2017], which has resulted in 269 confirmed cases, of whom 66 were admitted to hospital for treatment [a jump from 213 cases reported in the previous post from 6 Feb 2018]. Around one quarter of those admitted to hospital were treated in intensive care [see map at URL above and see post above [1] regarding outbreak in Nouvelle-Aquitaine].

Those figures represent a jump by around 50 percent in the number of measles cases since [24 Jan 2018], the last time authorities released data.

French health authorities said the death of the woman underlined the importance of being vaccinated against measles and asked the public to check their medical records to make sure they were.

"It's the only way to stop the epidemic," they said reminding the public that "there is no cure for the disease" which is highly contagious.

"Measles is not a benign disease, especially for children and can lead to respiratory and neurological complications that can have serious consequences," said the regional health authority (ARS) in a statement.

The hospital in Poitiers believes at least 5 people hospitalized there contracted the virus by coming into contact with another patient.

Hospital chiefs have not enforced a rule that all members of the public entering the emergency wards must wear a mask. Some 54 members of staff have had to be vaccinated.

Authorities are worried that the rate of vaccinations in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region is too low to cope with the epidemic. It is believed between 70 and 81 percent of the public are vaccinated but the level recommended by the World Health Organisation is 95 percent.

In France, children are vaccinated against measles, mumps, and rubella when aged between 12 and 18 months. A new law in France makes it obligatory for children to be vaccinated against 11 diseases.

[5] Ireland (Limerick, Dublin)

HSE [Health Service Executive] urge people to get MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine as number of cases expected to increase further.

The latest measles outbreak has worsened, with 10 cases of the disease in Limerick and 1 in Dublin, according to HSE.

The HSE's Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HSPC) has warned that it expects the outbreak to increase as a number of possible cases continue to be investigated.

The outbreak, which began in Limerick city in January [2018], is being tackled by the HSPC's measles outbreak control team, which offers advice on controlling the spread of the disease.

Measles is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus which usually results in a high fever and rash. It can also lead to blindness, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) or death, according to the World Health Organisation.

The best way to protect against measles is to be fully vaccinated with 2 doses of the MMR (Measles-Mumps-Rubella) vaccine. HSE staff in Limerick have been offering free MMR vaccinations in an effort to stem the spread of the disease.

Any person experiencing measles symptoms is advised to stay at home, not go to school or work, and to contact their GP. Babies younger than 12 months or people who have not been vaccinated with 2 doses of the MMR vaccine, as well as those with weakened immune systems, are most at risk of catching the disease.

More than 100 cases of measles have been reported across Europe this winter [2017-2018], leading to travel warnings for those who are not vaccinated.

The measles outbreak in Ireland follows news that the national uptake for the meningitis vaccine and vaccine against tetanus, diphtheria, and whooping cough [pertussis] fell last year [2017].

The uptake for the Tdap (tetanus, low-dose diphtheria, and acellular pertussis) vaccine among 11-14 year olds fell by 3 per cent in the 2016-2017 academic year to 85.5 per cent.

The Tdap vaccine was introduced to schools on a phased basis from September 2011 and extended to all areas from September 2012. It is offered to students in 1st year of secondary school and their age equivalents in special school and home schooling programmes.

Similarly, the national uptake for the MenC (meningococcal group C) vaccine also fell by 3 per cent to 83.9 per cent last year [2017].

The MenC vaccination along with a booster vaccine is recommended to children of 12-13 years and was introduced to schools in September 2014.

The Workers' Party has called for the introduction of a mandatory vaccination scheme for all children who use shared childcare and education schemes including crèches, play facilities and public and private schools.

Cllr Éilis Ryan warned that "misleading falsehoods about side effects associated with vaccinations" had led to a downturn in the numbers of parents availing of childhood vaccination schemes.

"We should not underestimate the danger of this trend," said Cllr Ryan. "Last November [2017], a baby died in the midlands from whooping cough. In this day and age, it is a scandal for any child to die from a preventable disease."

"In 2015, no country in the EU-17 had a tetanus/whooping cough vaccination rate below 90 per cent," she said. "For Ireland to fall as low as 83.5 per cent is therefore a major downturn. When vaccination rates drop below 90 per cent, the 'herd immunity' benefits to infants and children who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons begin to drop off."

The Oklahoma State Department of Health [OSDH] and the Cleveland County Health Department are investigating a confirmed case of measles in Norman located in Cleveland county. This is the 1st confirmed case in Oklahoma since 2015.

Measles was identified in a person who had returned to Oklahoma after international travel. Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease and spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus may remain airborne up to 2 hours in a room after the person with measles has left an indoor area.

Based on collected information about the measles case during the time they were contagious, public health officials want to alert anyone who visited the locations in Norman [listed at the source URL above] about potential exposure to the measles virus:

The OSDH is collaborating with officials of these organizations to identify persons that may have visited the mentioned locations to inform them of their exposure and provide recommendations.

Persons are protected if they are immunized with 2 doses of a measles-containing vaccine after the 1st birthday, or if they were born during or before 1957.

Those who think they may have been at risk of exposure should review their immunization records and contact the Cleveland County Health Department; their local county health department; or the OSDH epidemiologist-on-call, 24/7/365 availability.

Persons who are susceptible to measles usually develop symptoms about 10 days after exposure with a range of 7-21 days. Symptoms of measles begin with a mild to moderate fever, runny nose, red eyes, and cough. A few days later, a rash appears starting on the face spreading to the rest of the body accompanied by a fever that can reach up to 105 deg F [40.6 deg C]. Measles can lead to pneumonia and other complications, especially in young children and adults over 20. The disease can also cause serious problems in pregnant women and those with weakened immune systems.

Individuals that were exposed and are not experiencing symptoms of illness do not need to be evaluated by a healthcare provider. Those who experience symptoms of illness suggestive of measles should contact their health care provider before presenting for care to discuss instructions for check-in and registration.

People with measles can spread the virus up to 4 days before the onset of the rash and until 4 days after the rash starts. Measles can be prevented with the measles vaccine (usually given in combination with rubella and mumps, called MMR vaccine), and is recommended for all children at 12-15 months of age and again at 4-6 years of age. If a person has not received a 2nd dose of the vaccine between 4-6 years of age, the booster dose may be given at any age thereafter. 2 doses of vaccine normally provide lifelong immunity.

[The common thread through these posts is that unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated individuals are becoming infected with measles virus. It is also clear measles can lead to serious disease. - Mod LK]
