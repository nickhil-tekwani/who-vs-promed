Virus threatens coconuts in Bicol, Aurora, Quezon
-------------------------------------------------
The Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) reports that the coconut industry
will lose some USD 1.4 million in revenues because of a disease plaguing
coconut farms in the Bicol region, parts of Aurora and Quezon provinces and
Eastern Samar.
PCA Administrator Danilo Coronacion said they are now addressing the
problems caused by "cadang-cadang", which affects coconut trees. The PCA
has imposed a quarantine on affected areas and formed teams to address the
problem.
Coronacion noted that the disease is endemic in the whole of Bicol and
spread over Quezon provinces including Polillo Island, its boundary with
Aurora and Homohonhon Island in Eastern Samar. He said the lumber and
fruits coming from these affected areas should be isolated in safe sites,
as cadang-cadang is a highly contagious disease that can spread easily from
one coconut tree to another.
PCA records showed there are about 500 000 hectares of coconut trees
already afflicted by cadang-cadang. Because of the disease, the Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong, and Taiwan have all imposed a ban on coconut
products from the Philippines.
Cadang-cadang," which comes from a Bicol term "gadan-gadan" meaning dead or
dying, is a premature decline and death of coconut and palm trees in the
Philippines associated with viroid infection.

[The causal agent of cadang-cadang disease is coconut cadang-cadang viroid
(CCCVd), the type species of the Cocadviroid genus. A related species,
coconut tinangaja viroid (CTiVd), shares about 65 per cent overall sequence
with CCCVd. Both cause lethal infections in coconut, causing death within
10 years of diagnosis. Coconut production on Guam is practically
non-existent following the death of 30 million trees in the period from
1950 to 1980. Incidence of the disease is about 30 per cent. There is some
evidence that CTiVd is seed-transmitted at very low levels. In the
Philippines, the disease occurs in the central region (southern Luzon,
Samar, Masbate, and smaller islands within a zone about 600 km x 300 km).
Disease management requires use of sterilized pruning tools to avoid spread
of the viroid. - Mod.DH]
