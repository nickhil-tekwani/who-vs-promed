ANTHRAX, HUMAN, WILDLIFE - KYRGYZSTAN (NORTH)

I'd like to provide information from the Republican Center for
Quarantine & Especially Hazardous Diseases on a human case of anthrax
case in Kyrgyzstan.
The case is a 40-year-old man living in the "1st May" village in the
Sokuluk rayon, Chui oblast (North Kyrgyzstan). On 12 Apr 2007, he
went fishing in Kazakhstan on the Chu river in the Phurmanovka area.
On the way back home, he came across a saiga [antelope, presumably
dead]. The man butchered the saiga. The meat seemed to be bad, and he
poured oil (petroleum) over it and set fire to it. On 26 Apr 2007, he
received a diagnosis of cutaneous anthrax.

[While one might quibble gently about an uncertain long incubation
period, the history is patently clear. This area of Kyrgyzstan is
commonly afflicted with anthrax in the livestock. Our thanks to
Asankadyr for this report.
