Ontario is experiencing an increase in the number of cases of _Salmonella
hartford_. The Ontario Central Public Health Laboratory (CPHL) has
confirmed 40 cases since July 8, 1998. The CPHL is reporting between 5 and
8 cases per day (excluding weekends); a substantial increase over the
normal expectation of 0 to 4 cases per July from 1994 to 1997. The age
distribution is 3 cases (<1 year of age), 8 (1 to 4 years), 3 (5 to 9
years), 2 (10 to 14 years), 1 (15 to 19 years), 5 (20 to 29 years), 13 (30
to 39 years), 2 (40 to 49 years), 1 (50 to 59 years, and 1 (> 60 years
old). The cases are province-wide. A questionnaire is being administered to
all cases.
Preliminary investigations have identified that chicken has been consumed
by most cases; however, the chicken consumed is in a variety of formats and
retailed from different food premises. Further analysis is pending.
