It is not just anthrax which killed 16 elephants at Similipal Tiger Reserve (STR) in the past 2.5 years. Contrary to claims by officials at Similipal, information obtained under RTI [Right To Information] revealed that out of the 16, only 5 died due to anthrax.

Blood samples of all 16 elephants were sent for test at the Animal Disease Research Institute in Phulnakhara, Cuttack, out of which 11 turned out to be negative, the RTI pointed out. Of the 5 positive cases, 3 were from STR and 2 from Baripada forest division. This indicates that 11 elephants didn't die due to anthrax and poaching -- by electrocution trap or poisoning -- could be the reason behind their deaths. The RTI, filed by the Wildlife Society of Odisha (WSO), suggested that in 70 per cent cases tests for anthrax returned negative. "The ADRI [Asian Development Research Institute] data seem realistic. Had the anthrax spread, as is being claimed by the forest department, it could have been an epidemic. It could have spread to the cattle in the nearby habitation area and other prey animals. But there has not been a single instance of anthrax spreading to other animals," WSO secretary Biswajit Mohanty said.

Despite repeated attempts, officials at Similipal Tiger Reserve could not be reached for their response. WSO data revealed that the forest department claimed deaths of 16 elephants in STR between December 2014 and [25 Mar 2017]. Since 2010, 84 elephants have died in STR out of which only 26 deaths are attributed to poaching (both poisoning and use of weapon). The official record claimed 40 deaths as natural and 18 for unknown reasons.

Sources said the deaths of at least 39 elephants (within a span of 14 months -- between April 2015 and [12 Jun 2016]) could be discovered only after a week. Out of 39, 6 deaths came to the department's notice only after a month and 3 deaths after 4 months. The decomposed carcasses were not in a state that the cause of deaths could be ascertained.

The 39 carcasses were found in Keonjhar, Nayagarh, Cuttack, Sambalpur, Dhenkanal, Angul, Deogarh, Kandhamal, Sundargarh, and Mayurbhanj districts. STR is in Mayurbhanj.

[Five out of 16 is still a significant number of anthrax deaths, even though the Animal Disease Research Institute in Phulnakhara has shown up the attempted minimisation of the poaching in the area by initially claiming that they were all "anthrax." Both are significant problems though it must be admitted that elephant poaching is the major cause of severe elephant population losses, whether in India, elsewhere in Asia, or in Africa.

Anthrax testing of long dead elephant carcasses will come up with false anthrax negatives due to the decomposition pH of the carcass. With due respect to our Indian colleagues and cognizant that accessing the nasal cavity in an elephant carcass whether fresh or long dead is not easy and might present risks, I would like to suggest that an attempt be made to sample the nasal bones in such carcasses. I believe that they will discover anthrax positive cases among these carcasses. This would allow a better appreciation of where anthrax is and where it isn't. This will provide better information for improved surveillance and control.
