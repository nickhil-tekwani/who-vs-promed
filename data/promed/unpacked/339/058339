Yellow fever in Burkina Faso - WHO Update
-----------------------------------------------
As of Tue 1 Jun 2004, the Ministry of Health of Burkina Faso has reported
no new cases of yellow fever in Bobo-Dioulasso district (see previous report:
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2004_05_11/en/>
or ProMED-mail "Yellow fever - Burkina Faso (02) 20040514.1307").
However, there is a high risk of a major urban outbreak of yellow fever in
Bobo-Dioulasso in the immediate future. The rainy season is just beginning,
and the vector for yellow fever virus in an urban setting, _Aedes aegypti_,
is already present in the district.
Bobo-Dioulasso, with a population of 740 192, is densely-populated, and
vaccination coverage against yellow fever is low. The district is also a
busy crossroads for population movements across West Africa.
For these reasons, WHO strongly recommends a mass-vaccination campaign in
Bobo-Dioulasso as soon as possible.
