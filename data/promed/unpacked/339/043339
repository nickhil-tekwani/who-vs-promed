The World Health Organization (WHO)-Liberia Country Office has notified the National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL) of 2 confirmed cases of Marburg hemorrhagic fever in Gueckedou, the Republic of Guinea. The patients are a 46-year-old male and a female (age unknown) who were both residents of Temessadou, a sub-prefecture of Gueckedou. The Guinean Health Authorities were alerted by community members of Koundou Lengo Bengou, which is 54 km [33.5 mi] away from Gueckedou. This is the 1st time Marburg, a highly infectious disease that causes haemorrhagic fever, has been identified in the country, and in West Africa.

Gueckedou, where Marburg has been confirmed, is also the same region where cases of the 2021 Ebola outbreak in Guinea as well as the 2014-2016 West Africa outbreak were initially detected.

Marburg, which is in the same family as the virus that causes Ebola, was detected less than 2 months after Guinea declared an end to an Ebola outbreak that erupted earlier this year [2021].

Efforts are underway to find the people who may have been in contact with the patient. As the disease is appearing for the 1st time in the country, health authorities are launching public education and community mobilization to raise awareness and galvanize support to help curb widespread infection.

Liberia joins the [WHO] to applaud the alertness and the quick investigative action by Guinea's health workers. The potential for the Marburg virus to spread far and wide means we need to interrupt its transmission.

Gueckedou prefecture borders Liberia from Foya District, Iofa County, and there are active socio-economic activities across the 3 countries (Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea).

With the aforementioned notification, Liberia has heightened cross-border surveillance to quickly detect any cases, with all neighbouring counties on highest alert. The Ebola control systems are in place in Liberia, and the health sector is finalizing the Marburg Preparedness and Response plan.

Marburg is transmitted to people from fruit bats and spreads among humans through direct contact with the bodily fluids of infected people, surfaces and materials.

Illness begins abruptly, with high fever, severe headache and malaise. Many patients develop severe haemorrhagic signs within 7 days. Case fatality rates have varied from 24% to 88% in past outbreaks depending on virus strain and case management.

Although there are no vaccines or antiviral treatments approved to treat the virus, supportive care - rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids - and treatment of specific symptoms, improves survival. A range of potential treatments, including blood products, immune therapies and drug therapies, are being evaluated.

In Africa, previous outbreaks and sporadic cases have been reported in Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, South Africa, and Uganda.

Some key facts of Marburg haemorrhagic fever (MVD):
- Marburg virus disease (MVD), formerly known as Marburg hemorrhagic fever, is a severe, often fatal illness in humans.
- _Rousettus aegyptiacus_, fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family, are considered to be natural hosts of Marburg virus.
- The Marburg virus is transmitted to people from fruit bats and spreads among humans through human-to-human transmission.
- The Marburg virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever in humans.
- The average MVD case fatality rate is around 50%.
- Case fatality rates have varied from 24% to 88% in past outbreaks depending on virus strain and case management.
- Community engagement is key to successfully controlling outbreaks.
- Early supportive care with symptomatic treatment improves survival.
- The incubation period (interval from infection to onset of symptoms) varies from 2 to 21 days.

[The male case is doubtless the same one that was posted on 11 Aug 2021 (see Marburg virus disease - Guinea (02): (GU) conf, WHO 20210811.8585938). The female case is a new, 2nd person infected with the virus. Although these are the 1st confirmed human infections with this virus in West Africa, this virus was found previously in neighboring Sierra Leone in 5 Egyptian rousette, or fruit bats (_Rousettus aegyptiacus_) (see Marburg virus disease - Sierra Leone: bat 20200125.6916732 and citation below).

The above reports provide no information about the source of the virus that infected these 2 individuals.

The virus has been present in the general area and, unfortunately, ended up in a man and a woman in Guinea. Health authorities in both Guinea and Sierra Leone would be prudent to increase surveillance and ensure that laboratory support was adequate to make a timely diagnosis. The advice from WHO, above, should be heeded for preventive measures in healthcare facilities and to avoid wildlife practices that risk transmission to humans. - Mod.TY
