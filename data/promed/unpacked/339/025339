Confirmatory tests show that 4 cows in a Colorado dairy herd have tested
positive for bovine tuberculosis (TB). The ongoing investigation by the
Colorado Department of Agriculture and the United States Department of
Agriculture began in March 2010, when internal lesions were discovered on a
Southern Colorado cow at a slaughter facility. Subsequent tracing and
testing has led to the discovery of the additional positive cattle.

Bovine tuberculosis causes internal lesions in infected animals. It is
spread primarily by respiratory aerosols being exhaled by infected animals
and can then be inhaled by animals or humans.

Meat from the infected animals did not enter the food chain; commercially
sold milk is pasteurized, killing bacteria with heat, so there is no public
health concern when consuming pasteurized dairy products.

Livestock owners with questions can contact the State Veterinarian's Office
at (303) 239-4161.

[Bovine tuberculosis (TB) is caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_. While there
are other _Mycobacterium_ spp, _M. bovis_ and _M. tuberculosis_ are among
the most important, as these tend to move between animals and people.

Disease caused by mycobacteria often develop very slowly and may take
months to years to develop. These bacteria grow very slowly and only
replicate every 12-20 hours. While the pathogenic species (those which can
cause disease) such as _M. tuberculosis_ and _M. bovis_ can infect a human
or an animal, often the individual does not know that he has been infected.
In humans, those infected but without active disease can be treated to
prevent disease from occurring. To prevent other animals from being
infected, a diseased animal must be culled from the herd.

The disease primarily affects the respiratory tract but can also spread to
other parts of the body. The primary route of transmission is the exchange
of respiratory secretions between infected and uninfected animals. This can
be achieved through nose-to-nose contact or by the inhalation of aerosol
droplets that have been exhaled by an infected animal. Animals may also
become infected with _M. bovis_ by ingesting the bacteria. This could occur
by ingesting feeds that have been contaminated with _M. bovis_ by other
infected animals. Carnivores may become infected with bovine TB by eating
infected carcasses.

Various factors affect the efficiency in which _M. bovis_ is spread within
a cattle herd. The number of infected animals shedding the organism, as
well as the number of susceptible animals present within a herd can have an
impact on the transmission of the bacteria. For example, the more animals
within a herd that are shedding _M. bovis_, the greater the chance of an
uninfected animal coming into contact with an infected animal. The animal
density of a herd also influences the efficiency of _M. bovis_
transmission. Transmission of _M. bovis_ among animals housed in
confinement facilities may be greater because of close contact. Cattle
infected with bovine TB may shed bacteria in their feces, urine, and milk,
but these are felt to be a minor source of bacterial transmission.

Environmental contamination with _M. bovis_ may play a role in the spread
of bovine TB. Survival of _M. bovis_ in the environment is primarily
affected by exposure to sunlight. Reports on the length of survival of _M.
bovis_ vary from 18-332 days at temperatures ranging from 54-75 deg F
(12-24 deg C). Under laboratory conditions, _M. bovis_ has been isolated
for up to 8 weeks from various feeds kept at 75 deg F (24 deg C) and 14
weeks from various feeds kept at 32 deg F (0 deg C). Under field
conditions, however, it is difficult to isolate _M. bovis_ from pastures
grazed by animals known to be infected with bovine TB.
