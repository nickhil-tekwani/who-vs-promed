The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 7 Oct 2018:
- A total of 181 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, 146 confirmed and 35 probable.
- Of the 146 confirmed, 80 died and 50 are cured.
- 21 suspected cases are under investigation.
- 4 new confirmed cases, 2 in Beni and 2 in Butembo.
- 2 new confirmed cases, including 1 in Beni and 1 in Butembo.

News of the response
Epidemiological surveillance
----------------------------
- For several days, we have seen an upsurge in the number of confirmed cases in the city of Beni, which confirms the assessment that infected people who have escaped follow-up and vaccination are beginning to develop the disease. However, the increase in the number of alerts reported in the city of Beni reflects the strengthening of surveillance.
- The factors contributing to this situation are mainly misinformation, non-collaboration of the population with the response teams, and insecurity. More than 2 months after the declaration of the epidemic, the community continues to prevent the safe and dignified burial, and at-risk contacts still refuse vaccination and 21-day follow-up.
- According to new forecasts, the number of cases reported in the city of Beni could exceed the number of cases in Mabalako, the epicenter of this epidemic, which has already reported 91 cases including 65 deaths. In view of the situation, a series of administrative measures will be taken by the urban authorities of Beni to reinforce the respect by the population of the rules imposed by the health emergency. In addition, the Beni Ebola treatment center (ETC), which currently has 16 beds, will be expanded to accommodate at least 60 patients, additional doses of vaccines have been ordered, and additional epidemiologists will be deployed for alerts investigations.

Vaccination
-----------
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 15,114 people have been vaccinated, including 5250 in Beni [North Kivu], 4,289 in Mabalako [North Kivu], 1,663 in Mandima [Ituri], 1,392 in Katwa [North Kivu], 1,100 in Butembo [North Kivu], 434 in Bunia [Ituri], 355 in Tchomia [Ituri], 270 in Masereka [North Kivu], 240 to Komanda [Ituri], 121 to Oicha [North Kivu].

News of the response
Cross-border meeting for East African states
--------------------------------------------
- A delegation from the Democratic Republic of Congo was invited to participate in the cross-border meeting between East African countries from 2-4 Oct 2018 in Entebbe, Uganda.
- The purpose of the meeting was to improve cross-border collaboration in disease surveillance, preparedness and emergency response in East Africa. The discussions focused on the measures to be taken to prevent the spread of the current Ebola epidemic in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri.
- Participating countries worked to develop an action plan to strengthen their cross-border surveillance, emergency preparedness and disease response mechanisms, with clear roles and responsibilities for the various parties present.
- The meeting brought together participants from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, Burundi, South Sudan, Tanzania, Kenya, and Rwanda.

[Continuing community noncompliance and resistance in Beni, even though it is due to a small minority of affected individuals and families, has led to concerns that the number of cases there (57 total as of 7 Oct 2018) could surpass those of the outbreak epicenter in Mabalako (91 cases). Plans to increase the capacity of the existing Beni ETC by fourfold (from 16 to more than 60 beds -- more than the total number of Beni cases so far) is a dramatic consequence of this concern. The Beni ETC has been co-managed and staffed with ALIMA (Alliance for International Medical Action), but this report does not indicate where additional staffing will come from, and whether additional see-through patient isolation units that were introduced by ALIMA (see Ebola update (82) 20180905.6008197) will be deployed. - Mod.LXL

[2] International donations
- Sat 6 Oct 2018. Russia allocates over USD 60 million to fight Ebola in Africa
[TASS Russian News Agency, abridged, edited]
<tass.com/society/1024816>

Russia has allocated more than USD 60 million to fight Ebola in Western Africa, Russian Presidential Special Representative for the Middle East and Africa Mikhail Bogdanov said in his address to a session of the World Public Forum - Dialogue of Civilizations.

Currently, Moscow is actively assisting Africans in healthcare and medicine, he said.

"Russia has donated a total of USD 100 million to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria," said Bogdanov, who is also a deputy foreign minister.

"We continue providing assistance in the fight against the Ebola virus disease. For the purpose, Russia has allocated more than USD 60 million to eradicate this dangerous disease in Western Africa," he said.

- Fri 5 Oct 2018. UK gives Uganda GBP 5.1 million [about USD 6.7] to fight Ebola
[New Vision, Uganda, abridged, edited]
https://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1487062/uk-uganda-51m-pounds-fight-ebola
[Byline: Cecilia Okoth]

The United Kingdom government has provided Uganda with funds amounting to GBP 5.1 million pounds (about UGX 25 billion) meant to fight Ebola.

While visiting the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) on Fri 5 Oct 2018, UK's Minister for Africa Harriett Baldwin announced additional funds to be channeled towards tackling Ebola.

"Most topical at the moment is the outbreak of Ebola. The work that you are doing here is very important in terms of the quick turnaround of the diagnosis and finding out where the spread of the virus is happening," Baldwin stated.

"As you know, there is now an experimental vaccine for Ebola that has been deployed for the 1st time this year [2018] and the kind of work that is happening here is saving lives every day," she said.

Due to the prevailing outbreak of Ebola in DRC, Uganda has intensified surveillance and preparedness response in the high risk districts. Thermo scanners have been installed at Entebbe International Airport to screen all passengers coming in from DRC.

[The UK and Russian governments are to be commended for these financial commitments to combat Ebola in Africa. However, TASS reports that Russia's allocation is for Western Africa, so it is not clear what portion if any of those funds will go to help fight the current outbreak in the DRC, which is generally considered part of Central Africa.

The UK donation is not for the DRC, but for neighboring Uganda, a former British colony. Last week WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus reported to the UN Security Council [3 Oct 2018] that "To date, we have pledges for USD 8 million out of a request for USD 33 million for this critical work." (see Ebola update (105) 20181005.6072036).

In the original DRC MOH National Response Plan that was issued only a few weeks after the current North Kivu outbreak was declared, the total budget was estimated at about USD 44 million, based on certain key assumptions (for details, see Ebola update (75) 20180823.5981519). Financial figures are as important as epidemiological numbers in an international public-private Ebola outbreak response, so it would be very informative to have an agency or organization track the various financial commitments and uses thereof on a publicly available website. - Mod.LXL]

[3] Novel PPE suit
Date: Sat 6 Oct 2018
Source: American Journal of Infection Control [edited]
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2018.08.014


ref: Garibaldi BT, Ruparelia C, Shaw-Saliba K, et al. A novel personal protective equipment coverall was rated higher than standard Ebola virus personal protective equipment in terms of comfort, mobility and perception of safety when tested by health care workers in Liberia and in a United States biocontainment unit. Am J Infect Control. 2018. Available online 6 Oct 2018
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
----------
During the 2014-2016 Ebola virus epidemic, more than 500 health care workers (HCWs) died in spite of the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). The Johns Hopkins University Center for Bioengineering Innovation and Design (CBID) and Jhpiego, an international nongovernmental organization affiliate of Johns Hopkins, collaborated to create new PPE to improve the ease of the doffing process.

Methods
-------
HCWs in Liberia and a US biocontainment unit compared standard Médecins Sans Frontières PPE (PPE A) with the new PPE (PPE B). Participants wore each PPE ensemble while performing simulated patient care activities. Range of motion, time to doff, comfort, and perceived risk were measured.

Results
-------
Overall, 100% of participants preferred PPE B over PPE A (P less than .0001); 98.1% of respondents would recommend PPE B for their home clinical unit (P less than .0001). There was a trend towards greater comfort in PPE B. HCWs at both sites felt more at risk in PPE A than PPE B (71.9% vs 25% in Liberia, P less than .0001; 100% vs 40% in the US biocontainment unit, P less than .0001).

Conclusions
-----------
HCWs preferred a new PPE ensemble to the Médecins Sans Frontières' PPE for high-consequence pathogens. Further studies on the safety of this new PPE need to be conducted.

[Although difficult to quantify, at least some of the Ebola infections accidentally acquired by healthcare workers (HCW's) are due to mishaps in the arduous process of doffing contaminated PPE suits. The novel PPE suit described in this article was designed by the Johns Hopkins affiliates above in response to an Ebola Grand Challenge competition sponsored by the USAID and other US governmental agencies during the 2014-2016 West African epidemic to develop innovative approaches for Ebola health care worker activities. In addition to convenient rear pull tabs that promote faster removal, the suit also has a large clear face mask that allow both HCW's and their patients to better see each other. It also comes with a belt-worn battery-powered personal air conditioner unit that blows dry filtered air into the suit, enhancing HCW comfort (although such units may not be feasible or affordable in certain resource-limited regions).
