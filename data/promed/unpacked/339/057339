RUBELLA - CANADA EX NETHERLANDS (02): DUTCH DATA

Some background on the ongoing outbreak of rubella in the Netherlands up
through 10 May 2005:
There have been 299 lab-confirmed cases of rubella, one of whom had been
vaccinated (1 dose of vaccine, whereas normal schedule for MMR is one dose
at age 14 months and a 2nd dose at age 9 years); 22 cases in pregnant
women, 9 of whom were in the 1st trimester of pregnancy.
The epidemic is occurring in a religious community that refrains from
vaccination. The estimated total size of this population is 300 000 people,
but the number of families that totally object to vaccination is
decreasing. An earlier rubella epidemic occurred in this community in the
mid-1990s. It is difficult to estimate the number of susceptibles among
this community.
There were 7 cases reported in individuals not vaccinated for "other than
religious objection". We have an increasing number of "critical" parents,
similar to the antivaccination lobby. No cases were reported from that type
of non-vaccinated individuals.
Rubella surveillance is laboratory-based, however, so most cases are not
reported, because they are never lab-confirmed. Underreporting by labs is
zero. With large numbers of asymptomatic infections, and large numbers of
not confirmed symptomatic cases, we are doing some guesswork on the real
situation.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Drs Hahne and van Steenbergen for their
prompt contribution, giving the background on the rubella outbreak in the
Netherlands that appears to be related to the reported outbreak of rubella
in Canada. In addition, Dr van Steenbergen reminded this moderator that
there was a 2nd polio outbreak among this same population group that
rejects vaccinations based on religious beliefs in 1992/1993, and a measles
outbreak in 1999/2000. Some background references on the current outbreak
and prior outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases among the population
group referred to in this and the prior posting are listed below. The
sobering information above is that there were 9 cases of rubella among
women in the 1st trimester of pregnancy, the high-risk period for
congenital rubella syndrome.
