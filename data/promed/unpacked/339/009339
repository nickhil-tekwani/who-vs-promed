Health authorities have declared an epidemic of dengue in the Federal
District due to the registration of 30 to 50 cases per day in the
metropolitan area.
Since the beginning of the year there have been 1,693 cases of dengue of
which 1,083 are classical and 610 are hemorrhagic.
The information was revealed by the Director General of Health of the
Federal District, Jose Leon Uzcategui, who admitted that there are still
unreported cases, due on the one hand to a lack of reporting by private
clinics, and on the other to a confusion by many that the symptoms are a
typical viral infection when in reality they are dealing with classical
dengue.
He noted that two weeks ago there began an intense spraying effort to
eliminate [mosquito breeding grounds in the metropolitan area. The major
effort has been in the areas of Coche, La Pastora, the old highway of La
Guaira [Guajira?, La Vega, Sucre, Catia La Mar, El Valle and Santa
Rosalia. School children have also been brought into the campaign to
decrease mosquito propagation.
[The Director General said "spraying is only being done by ground since
experience has taught us that aerial spraying doesn't affect mosquitoes in
the air. In addition, we have learned that aerial spraying increases cases
of allergy and bronchial asthma in the population. The insecticide also
ends up on plants such as the palm tree."
Uzcategui noted the good news that in the last four weeks, there has been
no case of cholera reported.

[Three thoughts: (1) To me at least, this sounds like a disaster. Nearly
1,700 cases in a year indicates that Caracas will not run out of
susceptibles any time soon. That 36% of cases have hemorrhagic
manifestations indicates a hyperendemic situation with regard to dengue in
the area. Under reporting guarantees these are minimum numbers. (2) Can
anyone provide further information regarding the statement that bronchial
asthmas and allergies can result from aerial spraying of insecticides? (3)
Dengue viruses certainly are well-adapted, aren't they? It appears they
will be with us for some time. Much innovative research is necessary;
increased public education is critical. - Mod.CHC
