Dear moderator,
We are about to see an onslaught of uninformed persons weighing in on
the importance of laboratories in disseminating diseases to
surrounding communities. I would like to hear persons with data
(1st-hand experience or published reports) concerning escape of a
human or veterinary pathogen from a research laboratory with
resulting disease in the community. This information is very
important in striking a balance between the great benefits that
accrue from a vigorous research and surveillance effort and the
reflex of some to severely limit the study of pathogens.
Let me start with a short list that most would agree on without
further discussion:
Human
- Smallpox 1978 and other experiences
- Influenza 1977, China - escape inferred from sequence stability and
almost certainly correct
- SARS 2004, Beijing - limited secondary transmission, no objective
results of circumstances as yet released
Veterinary
- FMD outbreaks
- The recent Thailand avian influenza outbreak
I have some experience with the human pathogens, and it is remarkable
-- and important for all to keep in mind -- how few community
infections have occurred. The number of infections among laboratory
workers directly involved with the infectious agent is larger,
although greatly declining in the last 2 decades because of improved
laboratory containment.
I am also impressed with the small number of "escapes" of veterinary
pathogens that my very limited experience has identified.

[The smallpox incident in 1978 that CJ is referring to was a
laboratory accident in Birmingham, England, that resulted in one case
of smallpox with 3 deaths -- the case of smallpox died, the case's
father died of a heart attack and a senior laboratory person (the
laboratory director?) committed suicide.
The below responses are summaries of a rather lively discussion the
above email elicited among the ProMED-mail moderator group. - Mod.MPP]
[None of 290 other contacts, all of whom were preventively vaccinated, became
ill. Ref: Fenner F, Henderson DA, Arita I. Smallpox and its eradication.

Restriction of work with various infectious agents appears to be an
increasing and worrisome trend in the U.S. and elsewhere these days.
The intent is undoubtedly well-meaning, but the results could be
disastrous for research and researchers and for medical progress in
general.
The idea, as I understand it, is that there are people out there who
mean to do harm using biological weaponry. No doubt this is a
possibility, but the goal of restrictions is being justified to
encompass more than simply the possibility that a single individual
or group of individuals intends to insert a gene in an otherwise
harmless organism or virus and disseminate this hybrid or chimera in
a subway or football stadium. The national paranoia has been
expanded to worries that established laboratories will inadvertently
let loose a plague of some sort. This will have malignant
ramifications.
No doubt, controls must be in place regarding the handling and
containment of potentially dangerous organisms and viruses, but that
has always been the case. Institutional, local, state, and national
rules and regulations for handling these agents have been established
for many years and, for the most part, been successful. Very
isolated instances of "escapes" and mishandlings are known, but I
know of no published reports of widespread community disease
resulting from "escape" of an agent from a research laboratory. If
there are such data, they should be publicized, rather than
concealed. If there are no such data, then why the sudden concern?
Perhaps it is that people unfamiliar with research have -- because of
recent events -- been made aware of the possibilities. But these
people surely are not the ones who should be making informed
decisions regarding subjects about which they know nothing --
decisions made on political, rather than scientific bases.
Limiting the study of pathogenic agents (what's not a potential
pathogen in this age of immunodeficiency and molecular manipulation?)
to 100 laboratories, then to 25, then to 10, then to none at all, is
a scenario that will certainly destroy the scientific establishment
and remove the U.S. from the forefront of modern medicine and other
sciences.
Before this political football is kicked around even more, I suggest
that researchers organize a formal forum to discuss these crippling
possibilities and to then take action to preserve intellectual
momentum, so that we can continue to be prepared for the challenges
that inevitably lie ahead.

Sabia virus lab infection
(a) The 1st lab infection was in a lab technician involved in
isolating and identifying the prototype strain in Brazil (1992 or
1993?). No spread to other lab or hospital staff was seen.
Lisieux T, Coimbra M, Nassar ES, Burattini MN, de Souza LT, Ferreira
I, Rocco IM, da Rosa AP, Vasconcelos PF, Pinheiro FP, et al. New
arenavirus isolated in Brazil. Lancet. 1994 Feb 12;343(8894):391-2.
(Virus Service, Adolfo Lutz Institute, Sao Paulo, Brazil.)
(b) In 1994 a tube containing concentrated Sabia virus, the
arenavirus that is the agent of Brazilian hemorrhagic fever, broke in
a centrifuge at the Yale Arbovirus Research Unit. The centrifuge did
not have screw-top caps on the buckets, so the contents of the tube
were sprayed around the interior of the machine. The researcher
cleaned it up as best he could, but became infected. While in the
incubation period of the disease, before feeling very ill but
probably already infectious, he attended a conference in the USA
attended by a large number of people. Not one of them became
infected, and neither did any of the staff who attended him at the
hospital during his illness. He made a full recovery. Ref. Ryder RW,
Gandsman EJ. Laboratory-acquired Sabia virus infection. N Engl J
Med. 1995 Dec 21;333 (25):1716.
However, bear in mind that the number of labs working on infectious
agents has exploded in the last 30 years, with huge numbers of
students-in-training compared with the "good old days," with the
chances of sloppy technique skyrocketing, viz. the SARS lab
infections.

(a) Early to mid-1960s outbreak of FMD a few miles from the Animal
Virus Research Institute at Pirbright, UK, in a ?dairy herd, when the
former was doing experiments on birds possibly transmitting virus and
the infected animals were in a loose box (stable) one side of an open
courtyard, and target animals on the opposite side. I am copying to
Alex Donaldson so he can fill in the details.
(b) The other was from an offshore Danish FMD research institute that
affected a herd some kilometers away in ?Norway, about the same time.
Present institutional construction has dealt with any such risks
today.
It has been claimed that the present CWD problems can be laid at the
door of CoSU vet school, because the cases 1st occurred there and
"spread" outwards. A more honest assessment would be that healthy but
affected animals were held in an unnaturally high density with other
deer, which facilitated an existing but unrealised problem to display
itself to an informed scientific audience of pathologists and
wildlife clinicians.
CJ Peters is totally correct, in that the opportunity costs of
present restrictions, much less future ones, are far too high in
relation to the resulting slowed progress of research and development
of new ideas. We have had some one hundred years of medical and
veterinary research, with only a handful of accidents -- but with an
unbelievable yield of beneficial scientific advancement in disease
understanding, treatment, and control. We should always take
reasonable care, but let's not get paranoid about the risks.
