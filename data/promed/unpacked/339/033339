_Mycosphaerella fijiensis_, Causal Agent of Black Sigatoka of _Musa
spp._ Found in Puerto Rico and Identified by Polymerase Chain
Reaction.

Black Sigatoka, also known as black leaf streak, is caused by
_Mycosphaerella fijiensis_ Morelet (anamorph _Pseudocercospora
fijiensis_ (Morelet) Deighton). It is the most significant disease of
bananas and plantains (_Musa spp._) because most of the economically
important cultivars of exported and staple commodities are highly
susceptible. The Caribbean is one of the few regions of the world
where black Sigatoka is not widespread. Black Sigatoka has been
reported in the Bahamas, Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica (2). Yellow
Sigatoka, caused by _M. musicola_ Leach (anamorph _P. musae_ (Zimm.)
Deighton), has been recognized in Puerto Rico since 1938-1939 (3). In
August 2004, symptoms resembling black Sigatoka were first observed
in Anasco, Puerto Rico by extension personnel from the University of
Puerto Rico. Since black and yellow Sigatoka produce similar disease
symptoms, a survey was conducted in the western banana- and
plantain-production region of Puerto Rico to confirm the presence of
black Sigatoka. Leaf samples were collected from production fields
near the towns of Las Marias, Maricao, and Anasco. Single-ascospore
isolates were recovered using the discharge technique from moistened
pseudothecia in necrotic lesions that were inverted over water agar,
and ascospores were transferred to potato dextrose agar. The isolates
were subcultured in potato dextrose broth for mycelium production.
DNA was isolated from mycelium with the FastDNA kit (Q-Biogen,
Irvine, CA) for 19 isolates. Internal transcribed spacer as well as
the 5.8s rDNA regions were polymerase chain reaction amplified with
primers specific to _M. fijiensis_ or _M. musicola_ (1).
Amplification products (approx. 1100 bp) were observed for 18 of the
19 isolates, 6 of which were _M. fijiensis_ and the remaining 12 were
_M. musicola_, while the positive controls for both species were also
amplified with the respective primer pairs. _M. fijiensis_ was
recovered from production fields close to all three towns. The source
of _M. fijiensis_ in Puerto Rico is unclear, but it may have
originated from introduced leaf material and/or wind-dispersed
ascospores from neighboring countries. The presence of black Sigatoka
in Puerto Rico will most likely increase production costs where
fungicide applications will be needed to maintain yields. The
USDA-ARS, Tropical Agriculture Research Station is the official _Musa
spp._ germplasm repository for the National Plant Germplasm System.
As such, efforts are underway to introduce and evaluate black
Sigatoka disease-resistant clones that can satisfy local and export
market criteria.

[The tropical fruit crop plant banana, _Musa acuminata x
paridasiaca_, develops symptoms of the disease black sigatoka, also
known as black leaf streak, when infected by the fungus
_Mycosphaerella fijiensis_. This article reports the 1st detection
of the pathogen in Puerto Rico, but the source is unclear. It is
noteworthy that the USDA-ARS, Tropical Agriculture Research Station,
which is the official Musa spp. germplasm repository for the National
Plant Germplasm System, is located in Puerto Rico. The introduction
of this pathogen will be of some concern to them and their projects,
but also an opportunity to test new varieties. Infected banana trees
produce smaller leaves than normal, their fruit ripens prematurely (a
serious impediment to export sales), and fruit yield is reduced. The
related yellow sigatoka disease is not as severe, although it infects
plantains, dessert and cooking bananas. Disease management involves
application of protectant fungicides or systemic chemicals. There is
a tendency for resistance or tolerance to systemic fungicides to
develop over time, and this is being countered by use of
broad-spectrum, protectant fungicides. The frequency of application
and the amounts of fungicides used on banana and plantain globally to
manage this disease are unusually high for a crop plant/disease. The
authors note that fungicides will now be used in Puerto Rico to
maintain yields. There is an intensive international initiative to
develop resistant hybrids for the more long-term effort to thwart
black sigatoka. The crop is intractable to genetic improvement by
classical methods, since most cultivated _Musa spp._ are triploids
and, therefore are almost completely sterile.
