The best protection against Q fever infection is vaccination of those at risk (abbatoir workers, vets, agricultural workers). In Australia most vet students are vaccinated prior to commencing their studies, and abbatoir workers are strongly encouraged to become vaccinated.

Domestic cats and dogs have also been unrecognised intermediate hosts, spreading Q fever to veterinary staff assisting at surgical procedures. I don't know if there is a vaccine available in the USA. If not, it would seem to me to be an opportunity missed to protect those most at risk from an infection that can cause considerable morbidity and has significant occupational health and safety implications.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Rob Boughton for his comments.

Although protection for at-risk workers can be provided by Q fever vaccination, no licensed vaccine is available in the United States; a vaccine for use in animals has also been developed, but is not available in the United States (http://www.cdc.gov/qfever/prevention/index.html).

An Australian company makes a Q fever vaccine (Q-VAX) composed of formalin-inactivated suspension of _Coxiella burnetii_ organisms, which had been grown in the yolk sacs of embryonated eggs (http://www.csl.com.au/docs/39/836/Q-Vax_PI_V4_TGA-Approved-17%20January%202014.pdf). In Australia, Q fever vaccination is recommended for those working in "at-risk" occupations such as abattoir workers, farmers, stockyard workers, shearers, animal transporters, and others exposed to cattle, camels, sheep, goats and kangaroos or their products (including products of conception), veterinarians, veterinary nurses, veterinary students, professional dog and cat breeders, agricultural college staff and students, wildlife and zoo workers (working with high-risk animals) and laboratory personnel handling veterinary specimens or working with the organism; workers at pig abattoirs do not require Q fever vaccination (http://www.immunise.health.gov.au/internet/immunise/publishing.nsf/Content/handbook10-4-15).

If the person has a positive history of previous infection with Q fever, vaccination is contraindicated; in others, serum antibody determination and skin tests must be done before vaccination to exclude those likely to have severe local or systemic hypersensitivity reactions to the vaccine resulting from previous unrecognized exposure to the organism (http://www.immunise.health.gov.au/internet/immunise/publishing.nsf/Content/handbook10-4-15). Q fever vaccine is not routinely recommended for children aged less than 15 years of age and pregnant or breastfeeding women because safety of the vaccine in these situations has not been established. Revaccination is not indicated due to the possibility of severe hypersensitivity reactions. - Mod.ML]
