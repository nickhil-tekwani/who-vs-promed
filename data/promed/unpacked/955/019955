People are being warned not to eat donairs
distributed by an Edmonton company over _E. coli_
contamination, after several illnesses were
reported by public health officials. The
Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Athena Donair
Distributors Ltd. are warning donair
establishments and restaurants in Alberta not to
use or sell Athena Donair Distributors Ltd.
donair cones described below because the product
may be contaminated with the _E. coli_ O157:H7
bacterium.
The affected product is Athena Donair
Distributors Ltd., Raw Donair Beef Loaf Cones,
sold frozen in cases, containing 2 9-kg. donair
cones, bearing the UPC 7 75151 88802 8 and the
batch number 144. This product may have been sold
directly from Athena Donair Distributors Ltd.,
Edmonton, Alberta. There have been several
reported illnesses associated with the
consumption of this Product, CFIA said in a news
release.
Food contaminated with _E. coli_ O157:H7 may not
look or smell spoiled. Consumption of food
contaminated with this bacteria may cause serious
and potentially life-threatening illnesses.
Symptoms include severe abdominal pain and bloody
diarrhea. Some people may have seizures or
strokes and some may need blood transfusions and
kidney dialysis. Others may live with permanent
kidney damage. In severe cases of illness,
people may die.
The manufacturer is voluntarily recalling the
affected product from the marketplace. The CFIA
is monitoring the effectiveness of the recall.

[The donair is a Mediterranean-style pita-bread
sandwich of uncertain provenance. It is similar
to a gyro, except that the meat is beef, not
lamb, and the sauce more resembles honey mustard
salad dressing than the cucumber dill of
tzatziki. While it most likely came from Greece,
Turkey, or Lebanon, the donair has achieved
ubiquity in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and other parts
of Canada starting in the 1970s. - Mod.LL]
