The initial test of a 61 year old woman in central Thailand who fell ill
with bird-flu-like symptoms showed positive for avian influenza, Thai
officials and local media reported Thursday [3 Aug 2006]. The patient in
Lop Buri Province's Sa Bot district fell ill with bird-flu-like symptoms
soon after her backyard chickens all suddenly dropped dead, the Thai
newspaper the Nation said. She had initially tested positive for avian
influenza and was being treated in an isolation ward pending confirmation
from laboratory tests, said Dr Charn Tantiwa-raporn, director of Ban Mi
Hospital, where the victim was admitted on Tuesday [1 Aug 2006].
After being notified about the case, provincial livestock authorities
rushed to the woman's home to check for bird flu. District chief Somsak
Intra-watana said he had ordered an urgent cull of all poultry in the
province after being notified by the livestock authorities. This district
did not have many chicken farms and most of the poultry were fighting cocks
and native hens, he said. Although denying the existence of bird flu in Sa
Bot district, provincial livestock chief Jintana Danwiwatporn said experts
were coordinating with other agencies in dealing with hundred of thousands
of migratory birds. Along with warning against cooking and eating sick
poultry, the Public Health Ministry was distributing some 100 000 manuals
designed to educate the public about bird flu and ways to prevent
infections, said Dr Narongsak Ungkhasuwaphala, the Ministry's deputy
permanent secretary.
Meanwhile, Anutin Charnveerakul, caretaker deputy health minister, stated
that as of Wed 2 Aug 2006, 144 patients from 24 provinces, mostly in
northern Thailand, had been put on the watch-list for bird flu. Two more
suspected human cases were found in Phichit Province, where the 1st case of
human bird flu was recently confirmed. Phetchabun Province also reported 4
cases and Phitsanulok 3 cases.

A 9 year old girl, suspected of having bird flu, was pronounced dead on
Thursday [3 Aug 2006], one day after being admitted to a hospital in this
central province, according to a health official. The body of the girl was
kept at the hospital awaiting a lab test to determine if she was infected
with bird flu. The girl suffered from fever, sore throat, and severe cough
for 2 days. She was rushed to the hospital after having breathing
difficulties. Her family raises about 20 fighting cocks. Provincial health
officials had inspected her house and nearby areas although none of the
fighting cocks died of any unknown cause.
In the northern province of Nan, [another] 4 suspected bird flu cases were
reported and officials are waiting from their lab test results. Meanwhile,
agriculture and cooperatives minister Sudarat Keyuraphan said Thailand
would jointly discuss with officials of neighboring countries on measures
to control bird flu disease. The ministry will also hold a meeting of
livestock officials in 21 at-risk provinces on Saturday [5 Aug 2006] to
thrash out measures to prevent bird flu.

[The Thai Ministry of Health website regularly lists the number of people
under observation for possible avian influenza virus infection, together
with the number of suspected and confirmed cases. As of 29 Jul 2006, there
have been a single confirmed case and 80 cases "under observation." None
was assessed as "suspected"; see,
<http://thaigcd.ddc.moph.go.th/AI_case_report_060729.html>.
The 144 "suspected" cases referred to in the first report should be
considered as "under observation."
It is unclear whether the surviving 61 year old patient or the deceased 9
year old girl in Lop Buri province have been diagnosed as potential avian
influenza virus infection cases on the basis of laboratory testing or
merely on symptomology. Until further information becomes available,
neither case should be ranked yet as a "suspected" case.
