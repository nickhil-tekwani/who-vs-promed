Three cows that were struck down by an outbreak of Salmonella that killed 2 other animals are 'improving by the day'. The heifers are continuing to receive around the clock medication and care at the Spittal Pond farm, and dairy famer, [HK], is hopeful that they will make a full recovery.

[HK], whose father owns the dairy herd, said: "They are not 100 percent yet. But they are getting better by the day. They are still being given medication to help rehydrate them, but this will take time. The vet is still visiting them twice a day and doing what needs to be done. All the other animals are fine."

The 5 affected cows were part of herd of 10 new cows that arrived from Pennsylvania [USA] last month [May 2013] to provide fresh blood [new genetics, as these would be unrelated to the rest of the herd - Mod.TG] to [HK's] herd.

The new animals had been kept in isolation, so there is no risk to the rest of the herd or the public milk supply.

A leading world expert on _Salmonella_ told the Bermuda Sun that it was rare for the bacteria to have fatal consequences for cows.

Dr Aaron White said: "This case shows how important it is for new animals to be kept separate from the herd when they arrive." Dr White, a research scientist for the Vaccine and Infectious Diseases Organisation (VIDO) at the University of Saskatchewan [Canada] has spent the last 15 years studying _Salmonella_. He added: "It seems that the appropriate response has been followed by the farm.

"The only danger would have if the new cows had been put together with the dairy herd and shed the _Salmonella_ on to another animals. "All it takes is for the illness to shed onto the hay or feed and another animal can become infected.

"If they have been isolated properly there should be no concerns."

Salmonellosis is a bacterial disease with a rising prevalence in the cattle industry. It is most common in dairy calves one to 10 weeks of age, but can also be seen in adult dairy cows and beef cattle. Salmonellosis has a serious economic impact on the cattle industry worldwide. Livestock mortality, treatment costs, abortions, reduced production, discarded milk, and reduced consumer confidence, all contribute to the cost of salmonella to cattle industries.

Fecal contamination of feed and water from shedding cattle to naive cattle is the most common source and route of infection. The article does not tell us how these cattle became infected. They may have become infected en-route or at their location prior to shipment to Bermuda. Contaminated milk, contaminated processed feeds, and improperly cleaned calf-feeding equipment can also serve as sources of infection. Ravens, opossums, pigeons, rats, and mice can also serve as carriers or vectors.

The top 2 most common isolates from cattle at the US National Veterinary Services Laboratories are _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhimurium and _S._ st Dublin. Once ingested, salmonellae colonize and multiply in the intestine resulting in acute infection. Typical clinical signs of acute salmonella enteritis include fever and severe watery diarrhea with subsequent rapid onset of dehydration. The diarrhea is usually putrid and may contain blood and mucus. Salmonellae produce toxins that can contribute to gut damage and have systemic effects. If sufficient damage occurs to the intestinal lining, the bacteria may enter the bloodstream, resulting in septicemia, and the bacteria can spread to the brain, lungs, joints, uterus (causing abortion in pregnant cows), and other organs.

Cattle can be chronically infected and serve as carriers within the herd without exhibiting clinical signs. It has been reported that one carrier cow can shed one billion salmonellae a day in the feces.

Salmonellosis is also a significant public health concern. Humans and other animals can become infected from consumption of contaminated drinking water, raw dairy and milk products, and undercooked meat products.

Treatment generally consist of fluids and electrolytes, antimicrobial drugs, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

The use of antibiotics for salmonella enteritis without septicemia (bacteremia) is controversial. The population of normal intestinal bacterial microflora may be altered and there is also the possible development of antibiotic resistance by salmonella organisms.

Prevention should involve 2 approaches, the 1st being decreasing the chances of exposure to the organism and the 2nd being increasing resistance in cattle.

Critical control points to decrease exposure risks in dairy cattle are:
- Have herd serotested and cull carrier cows.
- Quarantine and serotest replacement stock.
-Isolate sick cows. Use only antimicrobials approved by your veterinarian.
- Avoid wet areas, provide dry loafing areas, clean and disinfect calf pens and maternity area between calves.
- Use clean flush water. Use only water from milking parlor.
- Check feed commodities for salmonella. Store and handle feed properly.
- Control infected rodents and birds.
- Do not allow rendering trucks access to feed or animal areas. Do not use front-end loaders for manure or to haul dead animals and then haul feed with them.
- Avoid prophylactic use of antibiotics.

It is recommended that producers consult with a veterinarian before instituting a treatment, prevention, or control program.
