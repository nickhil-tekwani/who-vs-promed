[Both of the above posts state that 15 of the 18 provinces were
affected. A previous cholera update on ProMED (20060825.2393)
contained a posting which said that the other 3 provinces (Cunene,
Moxico, and Lunda Sul) had cases, but numbers were not given. A map

[3] Cholera - Uganda (South Kivu)

On 6 Jan 2006, the local authorities of Uvira officially declared a
cholera outbreak in Uvira, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Uvira,
together with Fizi, were the territories of South Kivu Province most
affected by the epidemic. Nine weeks after the onset of the epidemic,
948 cases had been registered -- 215 in the 2 health zones of Fizi
and 733 in Uvira alone, with 13 deaths.
Many factors contributed to the outbreak and its spread in the
various health zones; these included limited access of the
populations to drinking water, lack of latrines or poor condition of
the existing ones and low levels of implementation of individual or
collective hygiene. Access to potable water was limited by the
incessant power shut-offs occurring in Uvira which at times lasted a
whole week, thereby making it impossible for the water supply company
to satisfy the population's needs. People were consequently left with
no other option but to get water from unsecured sources such as
rivers, lakes and swamps.
Generally, cholera affected the eastern provinces of DRC, as the
situation in some territories was characterized by insecurity linked
to attacks by armed groups, resulting in internal displacements.
Moreover, Congolese refugees continued to return home and newly
repatriated people were regularly registered in primary centers that
were set up in the Uvira and Fizi territories. Poor access to potable
water in the centres and surrounding areas increased the risk of
cholera infection as well as by other preventable diseases such as
malaria, respiratory diseases, and diarrhea.
