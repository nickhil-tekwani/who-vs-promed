A rare mosquito-borne disease that can be fatal to humans killed a horse in Luzerne County earlier this month [September 2012], state officials said.

Eastern equine encephalitis virus, which the state Department of Environmental Protection [DEP] says is transmitted by 5 species of mosquitoes, was reported in a 3-year-old miniature horse stabled in Luzerne County, state Department of Agriculture spokeswoman Samantha Elliott Krepps said. Krepps refused to name the municipality where the horse was stabled, saying, "That's a confidentiality issue."

She did, however, claim there was no immediate danger: "We have not quarantined any area. I can tell you that," she said.

Veterinarians report cases of diseases carried by mosquitoes to the Department of Agriculture. In this case, the veterinarian reported a sudden onset of ataxia -- loss of muscle coordination -- in the horse 2 Sep 2012, Krepps said. The horse went into seizures and died the next day [3 Sep 2012], she said.

Krepps said tests for rabies and West Nile virus were negative, and the department determined the cause of death was eastern equine encephalitis. Although different from West Nile virus, eastern equine encephalitis is also transmitted through mosquito bites. People don't catch it from infected animals or each other, but there is no [human - Mod.TG] vaccine against or treatment for the disease.

DEP Spokeswoman Colleen Connolly said eastern equine encephalitis can be fatal to humans in 30 percent of cases. The good news is the virus is rare: since 1964, there have been only 2 human cases in Pennsylvania, she said.

The last time an animal contracted eastern equine encephalitis in the state was in 2011 in Lancaster County; the previous case before that was in 1995 in Dauphin County, Connolly said.

She said DEP would work with existing West Nile programs in Luzerne County to inspect the area for mosquitoes that can transmit eastern equine encephalitis.

Surveillance so far indicates there is not a high number of the mosquito species, Connolly said.

"We're not going to take any risk here," she said. "If our biologist finds high numbers of these 5 species, we'll take action." That would likely include spraying to reduce the mosquito population, Connolly said.

She said DEP reminds people to wear bug spray, get rid of standing water, and be careful outside.

[Mosquitoes transmit the disease. Horses cannot transmit the disease to people or to other horses. Therefore, there is no need to quarantine the area. This disease is transmitted by mosquitoes.

All horses should be vaccinated against this disease. Horse owners should use fly and mosquito spray labeled for horses. This is an additional layer of protect (and comfort) for your horse.

There is no vaccine against EEE for humans.
