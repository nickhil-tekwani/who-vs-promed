Bull diagnosed with anthrax in southern Finland
-----------------------------------------------
A young bull in Orimattila in southern Finland was diagnosed with
anthrax late on Thursday [18 Sep 2]. The previous documented anthrax
infection was in 2004 at the same farm, which has about 20 head of
dairy cattle.

The province's head veterinarian was alerted to the farm to establish
the source of the contagion and order decontamination measures.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett

[The 2004 outbreak was ascribed to silage contaminated with soil. The
farm's previous outbreak had been in 1988. The cause of this
recurrence has yet to be determined but it might be simply from
having let vaccination cease and normal grazing exposure to
contaminated soil from the 2004 outbreak. We look forward to hearing
what they discover. - Mod.MHJ]
