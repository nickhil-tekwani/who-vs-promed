Local veterinarians are cautioning dog owners about a highly contagious canine influenza seen in the region.

Your dog just came from the kennel or a dog show, bringing home a cough, runny nose, or even a fever. It could be simple kennel cough, a catch-all name for bacterial and viral upper respiratory infections in canines.

But it could also be canine influenza, a relatively new illness caused by a virus closely related to an influenza that affects horses.

A recent spate of local cases has veterinarians talking about the disease and how to help dog owners.

Dionne Ferguson, DVM, DACVIM, practices at Veterinary Referral and Emergency Center in South Abington Township. While the center has seen no confirmed cases, they have received calls from referring veterinarians noting a recent increase, she said.

"The biggest concern is that it is a new virus -- pretty much no dogs have antibodies," Dr Ferguson said.

In January 2004, 22 racing greyhounds at a Florida racetrack developed a fever and cough, according to a 2005 paper in the peer-reviewed journal Science. 14 of those dogs began recovering after 10 to 14 days, but 8 died from hemorrhages in the respiratory tract.

Scientists compared the virus's DNA with other influenza viruses affecting pigs, birds, and humans. The closest match was the H3N8 equine influenza virus, meaning the virus likely jumped from horses to canines.

From June to August that year [2005], disease outbreaks spread to 14 race tracks in Florida, Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, West Virginia, and Kansas. In 2005, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified it as a "newly emerging pathogen in the dog population."

Because the virus is only a decade old in dogs, mothers don't pass down antibodies to their pups, Dr Ferguson said. Around 80 to 90 percent of those exposed will contract the virus, even if they don't show symptoms, she said.

"It's similar to flu in people where it's the very young and the old that are most severely affected," she said.

About 5 percent of dogs who get sick will develop severe symptoms, which can include pneumonia, said Doug Ayers, VMD, who practices at Northeast Veterinary Referral Hospital in Plains Township.

A kennel in New York recently brought a van full of 6 sick dogs to the hospital, he said. One had already died. Suspecting canine influenza, the hospital did not even let the dogs out of the van, he said.

Instead, they directed them to the Animal Health Diagnostic Center at Cornell University, where the 1st isolation of the virus was done in cooperation with the University of Florida.

This "high morbidity, low mortality" virus "probably is popping up more than we know," Dr Ayers said. "It's extremely contagious," he said. "Dogs at risk are dogs that are going to be exposed to places where there are many animals."

A vaccine is available, but as with the human influenza vaccine, it's not 100 percent effective at preventing infection, Dr Ferguson said.

Though they have not typically pushed vaccines, Northeast Veterinary Referral Hospital recently sent a fax around to local veterinary clinics "to at least start warning people that maybe it's reasonable for those with a high exposure level to be vaccinated," Dr Ayers said.

The "canine influenza virus" is an influenza A(H3N8) influenza virus (not a human influenza virus) that was originally an equine (horse) influenza virus. This virus has spread to dogs and can now spread between dogs.

The number of dogs infected with this disease that die is very small. Some dogs have asymptomatic infections (no symptoms), while some have severe infections. Severe illness is characterized by the onset of pneumonia. Although this is a relatively new cause of disease in dogs and nearly all dogs are susceptible to infection, about 80 percent of dogs will have a mild form of disease.

In order for this disease to reach "pandemic" status, it would have to involve more than a few counties. By definition, a pandemic involves a communicable disease that is spread over a large region. When discussing human disease it is generally thought to encompass large masses of land, such as several countries and even continents.

Treatment largely consists of supportive care. This helps the dog mount an immune response. In the milder form of the disease, this care may include medication to make your dog more comfortable and fluids to ensure that your dog remains well-hydrated. Broad spectrum antibiotics may be prescribed by your veterinarian if a secondary bacterial infection is suspected.

If you take your pet to a dog park, a boarding kennel, or play dates, then it is advisable to ask your veterinarian about the approved vaccine for your canine pet.

To date, there is no evidence of transmission of canine influenza virus from dogs to people and there has not been a single reported case of human infection with the canine influenza virus.

However, human infections with new influenza viruses (against which the human population has little immunity) would be concerning if they occurred. Influenza viruses are constantly changing and it is possible for a virus to change so that it could infect humans and spread easily between humans. Such a virus could represent a pandemic influenza threat. For this reason, CDC and its partners are monitoring the H3N8 influenza virus (as well as other animal influenza viruses) along with instances of possible human exposure to these viruses very closely. In general, however, canine influenza viruses are considered to pose a low threat to humans. As mentioned earlier, while these viruses are well established in horse and dog populations, there is no evidence of infection among humans with this virus.
