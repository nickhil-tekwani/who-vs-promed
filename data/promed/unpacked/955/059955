--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The news of fatal leptospirosis in France is distressing because it could/should have been prevented with chemoprophylaxis. Once its enzootic prevalence in known (as in France with about 800 human cases annually), any planned activity, like cleaning of a canal, should be after a single dose of doxycycline, 200 mg. That is sufficient for the single exposure. This is routine in India with wide distribution of human leptospirosis, especially after monsoon rains and flooding of roads. Although not scientifically documented, we all know that it works very well. If contact with water bodies is repetitive, like for watersports or a canal-cleaning campaign, the dose must be repeated. The protection from one dose lasts a few days. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says one week but we prefer shorter intervals of 2-3 days.

The CDC Yellow Book advises for travelers the following: "Travelers who might be at an increased risk for infection should be educated on exposure risks and advised to consider preventive measures such as chemoprophylaxis; wearing protective clothing, especially footwear; and covering cuts and abrasions with occlusive dressings. Limited studies have shown that chemoprophylaxis with doxycycline (200 mg orally, weekly), begun 1-2 days before and continuing through the period of exposure, might be effective in preventing clinical disease in adults and could be considered for people at high risk and with short-term exposures" (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/travel-related-infectious-diseases/leptospirosis).
