Re: Avian influenza, potential spread by smuggled birds
-----------------------------------------------
The 28 smuggled birds from Indonesia seized at the CKS Airport in Taiwan on
2 Nov 2004 were euthanized in accordance with the relevant law and sent to
the Animal Health Research Institute (the national veterinary laboratory)
the next day for testing. The result of real-time RT-PCR for avian
influenza H5 was negative. Your readers should be informed that Taiwan is
still a Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza-free country.

[Posting 20041207.3247 included a news item about customs officials in
Taipei who, reportedly, found 28 parrots packed into PVC pipe in a piece of
hand luggage that had been carried from Indonesia, "a country grappling
with H5N1 flu." ProMED-mail asked: "Have these birds been tested for H5N1
in Taipei?" The current detailed and clear reply reflects Taiwan's
efficient animal-health control system and commendable transparency.
A low-pathogenic, H5N2 avian influenza virus had been detected on 2 farms
in Taiwan during January 2004. The outbreak was promptly eradicated by the
application of stamping-out policy without vaccination. According to their
last follow-up report to the OIE,
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_48.HTM#Sec3>,
an extensive targeted surveillance has not detected any evidence of the
virus since 9 Mar 2004. - Mod.AS]
