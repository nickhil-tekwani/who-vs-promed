Disease outbreak in Banks Island muskox
------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of erysipelas has killed at least 100 muskox on North Western Territory (NWT)'s Banks Island.

Wildlife officials say preliminary lab results suggest erysipelas bacteria are causing the deaths. The disease is typically found in livestock such as pigs. This is the 1st time the disease has been seen in muskox in the NWT.

"Some of them have had evidence of their feet were thrashing and stuff, also their stomachs were still full, which indicates it was a fairly rapid onset of the disease," said Marsha Branigan, a manager of wildlife management with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources in Inuvik.

Branigan is encouraging people in Sachs Harbour, the only community on the island, to report any carcass sightings.

She's also cautioning people not to hunt sick animals, or hunt or drink water near them.

Humans can contract the illness but they can be treated with antibiotics. Symptoms include throbbing or itchy hands.

[_Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae_ is a nonmotile, non-sporulating, non-acid-fast and Gram-positive slender rod belonging to the family Erysipelotrichaceae that has been isolated from many species of birds and mammals. Pigs and birds are believed to be the most important animal reservoirs of _E. rhusiopathiae_. It is well recognized to be the primary pathogen of swine erysipelas and erysipeloid in humans, as well as a sporadic cause of diseases in domestic and wild animals. This might be the 1st report of the disease in muskox.

The musk ox or muskox (_Ovibos moschatus_), a member of the Bovidae family, is a mammal of the Arctic region noted for its strong odor and thick coat. The strong odor is given off by the males primarily and is used for attracting females during mating season. Generally this animal lives in the Arctic regions of North America but there are populations of the animal in Norway, Sweden, and areas of Siberia.
