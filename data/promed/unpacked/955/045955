Farmers along the Naab River in the upper palatinate region of Bavaria may no longer irrigate their potatoes and tomatoes with river water. The Naab upwards from where it joins the Danube is contaminated with _Ralstonia solanacearum_, bacteria that cause dangerous slime rots of those crops.

The pathogen spreads quickly and destroys potato and tomato crops. It is, therefore, classified as a quarantine disease by the European Union. Affected farmers will suffer serious yield losses, as well as financial burden due to mandatory fallow periods, as well as the necessity of extensive cleaning of machinery and storage areas.

According to the state agricultural authority Landesamt fuer Landwirtschaft, the origin of the contamination is unknown. The ban on the use of river water is indefinite. It will only be revoked once several consecutive water samples have been found to be free of the bacteria.

[Members of the _Ralstonia solanacearum_ (Rs; previously _Pseudomonas solanacearum_) species complex affect more than 200 plant species, including many important crops. The various races and biovars are active under different climatic conditions and in different hosts. The Rs complex has been included in the A2 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

A number of races and biovars cause bacterial wilt (BW; also called southern BW) of tomato and brown rot (also called bacterial wilt, slime rot) of potato, major diseases of these crops. These pathogens can also affect other solanaceous crops. Symptoms on tomato include wilting of leaves, root rot and death of the plant. In potato, yield losses are mostly caused by tuber rotting, before or after harvest.

The bacteria are spread by mechanical means (including insect activities), contaminated equipment, infected plant material, soil and water. They can survive in soil on plant debris or roots of hosts. Some solanaceous weeds and volunteer crop plants may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management is difficult, relying mostly on exclusion from new areas and use of certified clean planting material. Some cultural methods (such as crop rotation), control of pathogen reservoirs and phytosanitary measures may be used. Biological control is being investigated. Tomato varieties with some genetic resistance/tolerance exist, but may not be suitable for all regions. Potato cultivars with levels of genetic resistance are available for certain growing conditions.
