Viet Nam on Friday [2 Jul 2021] confirmed its 1st outbreak of H5N8 avian influenza at a chicken farm in the northern province of Quang Ninh.

Samples from the farm in the province's Ha Long City tested positive to the virus a day earlier, the agriculture ministry said in a news release.

It said the tests were conducted after around 200 chickens had been found dead at the farm last month [June 2021].

"H5N8 not only kills poultry but also infects humans without leaving symptoms," the head of the province's animal health department, Tran Xuan Dong, said.

The authorities had taken measures to prevent the disease from spreading further, it said, without elaborating.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said last week [week of 21 Jun 2021] the risk of human-to-human spread of the H5N8 strain of bird flu appears low, after 7 people in Russia contacted the virus but were asymptomatic [see comment below].

H5N8 outbreaks were reported last year [2020] in poultry or wild birds in Britain, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Germany, Hungary, Iraq, Japan, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, and Russia, according to the WHO.

[The mentioned A(H5N8) human infection in Russia was published in Eurosurveillance on 17 Jun 2021 (ref 1). The abstract follows.

"This study presents the isolation of influenza A(H5N8) virus clade 2.3.4.4b from a poultry worker during an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N8) among chickens at a poultry farm in Astrakhan, Russia in December 2020. Nasopharyngeal swabs collected from 7 poultry workers were positive for influenza A(H5N8), as confirmed by RT-PCR and sequencing. The influenza A(H5N8) virus was isolated from one of the human specimens and characterised. Sporadic human influenza A(H5)2.3.4.4. infections represent a possible concern for public health." Subscribers are referred to Mod UBA's comments in 20210606.8426576.

The 1st recorded HPAI H5N8 outbreak in poultry in Viet Nam, likely introduced by wild birds, is yet to be reported to the OIE.

It will be interesting to note if surveillance in wild birds is operational in Viet Nam.
