The Ministry of Agriculture has confirmed the outbreak of cassava brown steak virus in Luapula, Northern, and North-Western provinces.

Minister of Agriculture Michael Katambo says official surveys have established the existence of the disease. [He] says [it] is a threat to food security because cassava is the 2nd most important food crop after maize. [He] has advised farmers to plant disease-free materials and avoid sharing cassava cuttings.

Mathias Tembo, Zambia Agricultural Research Institute, disclosed that the disease could have originated from neighbouring countries.

[Cassava brown streak (CBS; also called root rot) disease can be caused by Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) and the more recently identified Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (both genus _Ipomovirus_). It is considered a threat to the whole of sub-Saharan Africa, where the crop is a major factor in food security. Symptoms may include leaf chlorosis, stem necrosis, and yellow/brown corky necrosis in the starch-bearing tissue of roots. Leaves may appear healthy even when the roots have rotted away. Total crop losses of 20-80 percent have been reported, and losses in individual root weight of up to 70 percent have been observed in susceptible cultivars.

The virus is transmitted by the whitefly vector _Bemisia tabaci_ (a serious crop pest in its own right) and is spread to new areas by infected cassava cuttings. Disease management includes pathogen exclusion, removal of infected plants, use of virus-free seed tubers for planting, and vector control. However, these measures may be difficult to implement in developing countries. Resistant varieties are being developed for specific local requirements.

Recent outbreaks of CBSD appear to indicate a westward spread of the viruses (ProMED-mail post 20130508.1698543). CBSV is a particular threat to new crop varieties developed with resistance to Cassava mosaic disease (CMD; caused by a number of species and strains in the genus _Begomovirus_ and transmitted like CBSV). A new CBSV strain adapted to higher altitudes has emerged in eastern Africa and is affecting additional CMD-resistant cultivars (ProMED-mail posts 20100525.1735 and 20120706.1191742).

Joint management of both diseases has become a major challenge in the region and globally (ProMED-mail post 20110829.2643) since development of crop varieties with stable resistance to multiple viruses is particularly difficult (ProMED-mail post 20090709.2463). The different viruses can be expected to mutate independently, resulting in a range of changing combinations of strains, and different crop varieties are likely to be needed that are geared towards local viral populations.

Several of Zambia's neighbouring countries, including Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, Malawi, and Tanzania, have previously reported CBS on their territories (for example, ProMED-mail posts 20130508.1698543, 20110318.0857, and 20140306.2316298). Consequently, the outbreak reported above is unfortunately not suprising. The suggestion that the disease was introduced from Zambia's neighbours seems plausible, but considering the wide distribution at the current time, this may not have been a recent event.
