Long COVID may be the cause of unexplained cases of hepatitis in children around the world in recent months, Israeli researchers from Schneider Children's Medical Center, Rabin Medical Center-Beilinson Hospital, Rambam Medical Center and Tel Aviv University found in a study recently published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition. A total of 12 cases of unexplained acute hepatitis in children have been reported so far in Israel.

The Israeli scientists who conducted the study noted that liver injury has been recorded in adult patients with severe coronavirus infections and that children can be affected with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) as a result of COVID-19, which can injure the liver. Post-COVID-19 liver injuries have been increasingly reported among adults as well.

The new Israeli study analyzed the cases of 5 patients who were hospitalized in Schneider Children's Medical Center in 2022 due to liver injury. All 5 patients had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 before presentation of symptoms.

The 1st patient, a 3-month-old infant, was hospitalized for acute liver failure 21 days after being diagnosed with COVID-19. Eleven days later, he underwent a liver transplant. The infant was negative for adenovirus, SARS-CoV-2, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex virus.

The 2nd patient, a 5-month-old patient, was hospitalized with a fever, jaundice and an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly) and his condition deteriorated, leading to him needing a liver transplant. He tested positive for both adenovirus and SARS-CoV-2. After the transplant, he tested positive for CMV as well.

The 3rd patient, a previously healthy 8-year-old boy, tested positive for the novel coronavirus before experiencing liver injury. About 130 days after his COVID-19 diagnosis, he arrived at the hospital with abdominal pain, vomiting and jaundice. He was not found to be infected with adenovirus.

The 4th patient, an 8-year-old boy, began experiencing abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea and jaundice about 90 days after being diagnosed with COVID-19. He was not found to be infected with adenovirus.

The 5th patient, a previously healthy 13-year-old boy, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after presenting with weakness, diarrhea, jaundice and abdominal pain. Fifty-three days after testing positive, he arrived at the hospital with vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, hepatomegaly and liver injury. During his hospitalization, he needed to undergo a liver transplant. After the operation, he tested positive for CMV and adenovirus.

The patients analyzed by the study had asymptomatic or mild presentation of COVID-19 before the onset of liver issues, while among adults most patients who experienced liver issues had been in the ICU for a prolonged period while suffering from severe cases of COVID-19.

Other studies conducted around the world have also found that some COVID-19 patients suffer from liver issues weeks or even months after being diagnosed with COVID-19.

The scientists noted that while many of the unexplained acute hepatitis cases around the world have also tested positive for adenovirus, this may not be the cause for the liver issues as adenovirus usually causes severe hepatitis in immunocompromised patients and these patients were healthy before experiencing hepatitis.

The scientists analyzed samples of the livers of the patients to see if there were signs that adenovirus had caused the damage to the organ, but did not find any antigens indicating adenoviruses or any features suggesting hepatitis caused by an adenovirus. A number of other analyses of the liver tissue of other cases from around the world also failed to find any signs of liver damage caused by an adenovirus.

A number of possible mechanisms may cause liver injury during acute disease and after recovery from COVID-19, including direct viral damage, injuries caused by an aberrant immune response, restricted blood flow (ischemia), increased blood clotting (hypercoagulability state) and drug-induced injuries.

As none of the patients in the study had severe cases of COVID-19, the scientists stated that this suggested that the liver injury may have been caused by direct viral damage caused through the ACE2 receptor to which the SARS-CoV-2 binds and enters the cell.

Another possible mechanism that could have caused the liver damage is if the immune system either underreacted or overreacted to the infection. Autoimmune and auto-inflammatory diseases such as MIS-C have been reported in both children and young adults with long COVID-19, which could lead to liver disease.

Inflammation and an unusual immune response could also have impaired the health of the patients and led to disease in predisposed individuals. The 2nd patient in the study had a systemic inflammatory syndrome called secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), which could support the theory that the liver injury was caused by an immune-mediated mechanism.

The scientists concluded that the most likely causes of the acute hepatitis were either a post-infection immune reaction like MIS-C or an abnormal immune response to the novel coronavirus which primed the body for other infectious agents like adenovirus.

In early April 2022, the UK reported an increase in acute hepatitis cases with an unexplained cause among previously healthy children. Since then, about 700 probable cases of unexplained acute hepatitis have been reported from 34 countries, according to the World Hepatitis Alliance. The WHO assesses the global risk from the unexplained hepatitis cases as moderate.

Of the cases, at least 38 have required transplants and 10 have died. Since the cases were first reported, the WHO and US CDC have posited that an adenovirus may be the cause, as some of the affected patients were also found to be infected with an adenovirus. In England, 68% of cases tested positive for adenovirus.

"In terms of how worried we should be about this outbreak, it's the 1st time so many cases of severe acute hepatitis have been seen," said Dr. Philippa Easterbrook, technical lead of the incident team at WHO headquarters, at the World Hepatitis Summit last week. "A proportion of cases have developed liver failure, required transplantation or resulted in death. It has to be taken seriously. An important step at the moment is to understand its cause."

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is set to publish the preliminary findings of a epidemiological study into the acute hepatitis cases on 16 Jun 2022.

A pre-print study by researchers from KU Leuven (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.08.22276091v1.full) found 9 cases of unexplained acute hepatitis from September 2021 to April 2022, when high levels of both adenovirus and SARS-CoV-2 were circulating among the general population in Belgium. No cases of unexplained acute hepatitis were found in earlier timeframes checked by the researchers.

The researchers from KU Leuven stressed that their observations "do not confirm or exclude the possibility that adenovirus or SARS-CoV-2 infections are contributors to the rise in acute hepatitis cases in children." They added that if either or both viruses do contribute, then their findings show that only a small minority of infections are likely to lead to severe hepatitis, as there were only a few hospitalizations due to hepatitis while there was a high rate of community transmission of both viruses.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
--------
"Objectives: SARS CoV-2, the novel coronavirus responsible for coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has been a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Gastrointestinal and hepatic manifestations during acute disease have been reported extensively in the literature. Post-COVID-19 cholangiopathy has been increasingly reported in adults. In children, data are sparse. Our aim was to describe pediatric patients who recovered from COVID-19 and later presented with liver injury.

"Methods: This is a retrospective case-series study of pediatric patients with post-COVID-19 liver manifestations. We collected data on demographics, medical history, clinical presentation, laboratory results, imaging, histology, treatment, and outcome.

"Results: We report 5 pediatric patients who recovered from COVID-19 and later presented with liver injury. Two types of clinical presentation were distinguishable. Two infants aged 3 and 5 months, previously healthy, presented with acute liver failure that rapidly progressed to liver transplantation. Their liver explant showed massive necrosis with cholangiolar proliferation and lymphocytic infiltrate. Three children, 2 aged 8 years and one aged 13 years, presented with hepatitis with cholestasis. Two children had a liver biopsy significant for lymphocytic portal and parenchyma inflammation, along with bile duct proliferation. All 3 were started on steroid treatment; liver enzymes improved, and they were weaned successfully from treatment. For all 5 patients, extensive etiology workup for infectious and metabolic etiologies were negative.

"Conclusions: We report 2 distinct patterns of potentially long COVID-19 liver manifestations in children with common clinical, radiological, and histopathological characteristics after a thorough workup excluded other known etiologies."

We still await large-scale serological data on recent SARS-CoV-2 in the entire cohort of children fitting the WHO definition of severe hepatitis, hopefully with a control group of children without the hepatitis. It remains unclear what the underlying etiology is, and multiple etiologies are possible, which might be suggested by the 2 different types of illnesses described above. The latest UKHSA data are to be released tomorrow, 16 Jun 2022, and more extensive data from the USA cases are awaited. - Mod.LL]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In November 2021, CDC was notified of a cluster of previously healthy children with hepatitis of unknown etiology evaluated at a single USA hospital (1). On 21 Apr 2022, following an investigation of this cluster and reports of similar cases in Europe (2,3), a health advisory was issued requesting US providers to report pediatric cases of hepatitis of unknown etiology to public health authorities. In the USA and Europe, many of these patients have also received positive adenovirus test results (1,3). Typed specimens have indicated adenovirus type 41, which typically causes gastroenteritis (1,3). Although adenovirus hepatitis has been reported in immunocompromised persons, adenovirus is not a recognized cause of hepatitis in healthy children (4). Because neither acute hepatitis of unknown etiology nor adenovirus type 41 is reportable in the USA, it is unclear whether either has recently increased above historical levels.

Data from 4 sources were analyzed to assess trends in hepatitis-associated emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations, liver transplants, and adenovirus stool testing results among children in the USA. Because of potential changes in healthcare-seeking behavior during 2020-2021, data from October 2021-March 2022 were compared with a pre-COVID-19 pandemic baseline. These data do not suggest an increase in pediatric hepatitis or adenovirus types 40/41 above baseline levels. Pediatric hepatitis is rare, and the relatively low weekly and monthly counts of associated outcomes limit the ability to interpret small changes in incidence. Ongoing assessment of trends, in addition to enhanced epidemiologic investigations, will help contextualize reported cases of acute hepatitis of unknown etiology in American children.

Data in this report were obtained from the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP), the Premier Healthcare Database Special Release (PHD-SR), the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN), and Labcorp, a large commercial laboratory network. NSSP collects electronic health data from EDs in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, representing 71% of nonfederal EDs in the USA. ED visits associated with hepatitis of unspecified etiology among children aged 0-4 and 5-11 years during January 2018-March 2022 were identified via International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) discharge diagnosis codes (3); data were queried on 26 May 2022 and restricted to facilities with high data quality and consistent reporting during 2018-2022. Data on hospitalizations associated with hepatitis of unspecified etiology were obtained on 25 May 2022 from PHD-SR, which includes inpatient records from approximately 1000 hospitals. Hospital admissions among children aged 0-4 and 5-11 years during January 2019-March 2022 were identified using the same ICD-10-CM codes as were used for ED data. Data on pediatric liver transplants were obtained on 20 May 2022 from the national registry managed by OPTN; these included monthly counts of liver transplants performed among patients aged <18 years in the United States during January 2017-March 2022, for whom the primary diagnosis at time of transplant was acute hepatic necrosis of unknown etiology. Labcorp data, accessed on 6 Jun 2022, included deidentified results for all stool specimens tested for adenovirus types 40/41 (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes [LOINC] code 82209-8) among children aged 0-4 and 5-9 years during October 2017-March 2022.

Weekly numbers of ED visits during October 2021-March 2022 were compared with a prepandemic baseline (January 2018-February 2020) using a modified Farrington Method (5). Monthly hospitalizations and liver transplants during October 2021-March 2022 were compared with those for the same months (January-March and October-December) during the calendar years 2017, 2018, and 2019, as available, using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Data on hospitalizations and liver transplants during January 2020-September 2021 were excluded from each respective baseline because of possible impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Monthly stool specimen results are presented as total tests (all specimens with a negative or positive result) and percentage positive for adenovirus types 40/41. The percentage of stool specimens testing positive for adenovirus types 40/41 during October 2021-March 2022 was compared with that during the same months (October-March) of 2017-2018, 2018-2019, and 2019-2020, to minimize potential effects of seasonality. Analyses were conducted in R (version 4.1.1; R Foundation). This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.

Compared with a pre-COVID-19 pandemic baseline, no increase in weekly ED visits with hepatitis-associated discharge codes was observed during October 2021-March 2022 among children aged 0-4 or 5-11 years (Figure 1 [for figures, see source URL - Mod.LL]). During January 2019-March 2022, a median of 22 (range = 9-29) and 10 (range = 4-19) hepatitis-associated hospitalizations among children aged 0-4 and 5-11 years, respectively, were recorded each month (Figure 2) (Supplementary Figure, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/118245). No significant changes were detected in the number of hepatitis-associated hospitalizations during October 2021-March 2022 compared with the same months before the COVID-19 pandemic among children aged 0-4 years (22 and 19.5, respectively, p = 0.26) or 5-11 years (12 and 10.5, respectively, p = 0.42). A median of 4 (range = 0-10) liver transplants occurred among persons aged <18 years each month during January 2017-March 2022 (Figure 2) (Supplementary Figure, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/118245). No significant increase in the number of monthly liver transplants was observed during October 2021-March 2022 (5) compared with the same months during 2017-2019 (4) (p = 0.19). During October 2017-March 2022, the monthly number of adenovirus tests ranged from 184 to 1759 among children aged 0-4 years and from 140 to 725 among children aged 5-9 years (Figure 3). Among both age-groups, the number of adenovirus tests was highest in March 2022. During October-March in 2017-2018, 2018-2019, and 2019-2020, the monthly percentage of specimens positive for adenovirus types 40/41 ranged from 5% to 19% among children aged 0-4 years and from 3% to 14% among children aged 5-9 years. After a decrease in testing volume and percentage positive during April 2020-September 2021, the percentage of specimens positive for adenovirus types 40/41 during October 2021-March 2022 returned to, but did not exceed, prepandemic levels in both age-groups.

Discussion
----------
Data from 4 large administrative databases were analyzed to assess trends in pediatric hepatitis and percentage of stool specimens positive for adenovirus type 40/41. These data indicate that neither outcome has recently increased above pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Although this ecologic analysis cannot conclusively confirm or refute a potential association between pediatric hepatitis and adenovirus, it provides useful context for the ongoing investigation.

Data from 2 large electronic health record systems and the liver transplant registry did not indicate an increase in pediatric ED visits or hospitalizations associated with hepatitis of unspecified etiology or pediatric liver transplants in the USA. Historical data on pediatric hepatitis from other countries are also limited. Although the UK has observed increases in hepatitis among children aged 1-4 years when comparing 2022 with previous years (6), data from multiple other European and non-European countries have been inconclusive (7,8).

The percentage of specimens positive for adenovirus types 40/41 among children aged 0-4 and 5-9 years did not appear to increase above prepandemic historical levels, although the total number of specimens submitted for testing has increased over time. The UK has reported an increase in the number of adenovirus-positive stool specimen test results among children aged 1-4 years compared with prepandemic levels. However, UK data on testing volume, and thus percentage positive for adenovirus, are currently unavailable (6).

The findings in this report are subject to at least 7 limitations. First, although liver transplants are well-documented, cases of hepatitis of unknown etiology are not reportable in the USA. This analysis assessed trends using electronic health data on pediatric hepatitis of unspecified etiology as a proxy, but the exact baseline remains unknown, as does the accuracy and completeness of the diagnostic codes used for identification. Second, data on hospitalizations and liver transplants have up to a 2- to 3-month lag between outcome and report; March 2022 data might be underreported. Third, the COVID-19 pandemic likely affected observed patterns during the analysis period because of its effects on healthcare-seeking behavior (9) and infectious disease epidemiology during 2020-2021, and these patterns might still be normalizing. Prepandemic data are limited to 2017-2019, and it is not known whether these data represent a reliable baseline. Fourth, although NSSP and PHD-SR capture a large number of ED visits and hospitalizations, respectively, they do not cover the entire US population, nor do they represent the same catchment areas. Similarly, Labcorp data represent only one large laboratory network and are not deduplicated to the patient level. The extent to which changes in testing volume might be due to changes in laboratory market share or test-ordering practices could not be determined, although the percentage of positive test results should not be substantially affected. Fifth, although the Labcorp assay cannot distinguish between adenovirus types 40 and 41, nearly 90% of adenovirus detections in American children with gastroenteritis are type 41 (10). Sixth, cases of acute hepatitis of unknown etiology are generally rare; thus, small changes in incidence might be difficult to detect and interpret. Finally, these results are intended to provide an overview of trends in pediatric acute hepatitis of unspecified etiology and adenovirus types 40/41 in the USA and cannot be used to infer or disprove a causal link between these 2 illnesses.

These analyses, based on 4 data sources, did not indicate a recent increase in hepatitis-associated ED visits or hospitalizations among children aged 0-11 years, liver transplants among children aged 0-17 years, or percentage of specimens positive for adenovirus types 40/41 among children aged 0-9 years in the USA compared with pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. The potential role of adenovirus in the etiology of the newly reported hepatitis cases is unknown; ongoing investigations are assessing this hypothesis along with the possible role of other factors, including current or past infections with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. It remains unknown whether the recently reported cases represent a novel etiology of pediatric acute hepatitis or a previously existing phenomenon that is now being detected. The rarity of this outcome makes it difficult to detect small changes, and pandemic-associated disruptions in healthcare-seeking behavior and infectious disease epidemiology might still be normalizing. Ongoing assessment of trends in addition to enhanced epidemiologic investigations will help contextualize reported cases of acute hepatitis of unknown etiology in American children.

[This analysis could be interpreted that the recent reports of severe hepatitis in children in the USA do not represent an increase over baseline, but as noted in the discussion a number of limitations of the report exist. Until a good confirmed explanation of the etiology of these recent cases is established, little more related to overall incidence can be said. - Mod.LL]

A mysterious hepatitis outbreak affecting children across the USA is now in Maine. The Maine CDC says the child was hospitalized with serious liver illness and is recovering. The CDC says there is no known cause for the infection, similar to infections in children reported in several other states.

Maine CDC Director Dr. Nirav Shah says hepatitis with no known causes is rare in children, and parents should look for symptoms, including fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, stomach pain, vomiting, dark colored urine, light-colored stools, joint pain and yellowing of the skin.

Fewer than 10 children in Georgia have been diagnosed with pediatric hepatitis, State Epidemiologist Cherie L. Drenzek said at the state Board of Public Health's monthly meeting Tuesday [14 Jun 2022].

The pediatric hepatitis outbreak began in Alabama in October 2021. So, far 245 children in the USA have had the mysterious disease. Most needed to be hospitalized and 9 have died.

"(The CDC) is casting a really wide net to look at what potentially could be involved, other cofactors, previous infections," Drenzek said. Some staff members at Atlanta children's hospitals are helping with the studies, Drenzek added.

Prior to this outbreak, public health officials did not closely track hepatitis in children, so it's hard to determine whether the recently identified cases are much higher than typical rates, Drenzek said. She emphasized that the disease remains very rare.

[Except for the UK data, no epicurves have been produced to best assess which of the newly reported cases are truly new or just found retrospectively.

Until a definitive cause is found, it remains to be shown how many of the reported cases are due to the same etiology and how many subclinical or mild cases have occurred. The lack of clusters of cases is not easily explainable, but genetic differences in individuals may be playing a role.

An example of this related to SARS-CoV-2 infection is illustrated by the following report:

Abstract
--------
"Clinical outcome upon infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ranges from silent infection to lethal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We have found enrichment in rare variants predicted to be loss-of-function (LOF) at the 13 human loci known to govern Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)- and interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)-dependent type I interferon (IFN) immunity to influenza virus in 659 patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia relative to 534 subjects with asymptomatic or benign infection. By testing these and other rare variants at these 13 loci, we experimentally defined LOF variants underlying autosomal-recessive or autosomal-dominant deficiencies in 23 patients (3.5%) 17 to 77 years of age. We show that human fibroblasts with mutations affecting this circuit are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. Inborn errors of TLR3- and IRF7-dependent type I IFN immunity can underlie life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with no prior severe infection."

Dr. Casanova, the senior author on this paper, has published many articles showing that subtle genetic changes can be associated with more severe disease due to a variety of pathogens. - Mod.LL]
