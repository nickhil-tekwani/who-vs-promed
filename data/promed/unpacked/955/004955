Due to a "catastrophic" disease outbreak in corn crops, Ontario farmers say they will likely need help. "We are facing one of the most severe outbreaks of DON that we have ever seen, and some areas of the province are being hit especially hard," Markus Haerle, Grain Farmers of Ontario, said. The situation is "at a catastrophic level at this point, [and] it is only getting worse."

DON is a type of vomitoxin caused by Gibberella Ear Rot. Health Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) regulations limit the level of vomitoxin. Crops with levels above the accepted limit cannot be sold as livestock or human feed. There are limited alternatives, including the ethanol industry. As a result, the grain is often unsellable.

Farmers in Iowa and elsewhere in North America are finding increased levels of a plant toxin known as vomitoxin in corn. Grain buyers can reject shipments that contain it or even fine farmers. Wet weather this [2018] autumn caused the fungus to develop while delaying harvests, Iowa State University's Charles Hurburgh said. Livestock and ethanol producers need to blend corn that contains vomitoxin with corn that does not when toxin levels are high.

Smithfield Foods has detected vomitoxin in corn in Iowa and Nebraska, where it is not normally a problem. Ethanol plants in Michigan and Ohio also are testing corn for the toxin and charging farmers penalties if their loads contain too much. In upstate New York, farmers are feeding dairy cattle with millfeeds -- a byproduct of wheat flour milling -- instead of contaminated corn.

Alltech, a Kentucky-based feed supplement company, had tested 45 samples of this year's [2018] U.S. corn harvest and found 80 per cent contained vomitoxin. That is about average, they said, but expected further testing to reveal bigger problems. More samples have not been examined yet because of the rains that delayed harvesting. "It's going to get worse," they said.

[Several species of fungi originally classified in the genus _Fusarium_ are causing a number of diseases or disease complexes in grain crops. The diseases include head blights, stalk rots, seedling root rots and ear rots of wheat, maize, barley, rye, oats, and other crops. Pathogens affecting these hosts may be different phylogenetic species or strains, which are often limited to particular regions of the world. While some of the pathogens have now been re-classified into different genera, the associated diseases are often still collectively referred to as 'fusarium diseases'.

For maize, _Gibberella zeae_ (previously _Fusarium graminearum_) causes an ear rot ("red" ear rot), but other fungi from the 'fusarium disease' group may be responsible for different ear, stalk, and kernel rots. Maize ear rots are often associated with insect damage to ears or kernels which provides easy entrance points for the fungi.

Depending on the fungal species or strains involved, as well as on environmental factors during plant growth and grain storage, fusarium diseases may also contaminate the grain with mycotoxins, for example DON (also called vomitoxin), which can seriously affect livestock. The total crop may be lost if grain is rejected because of toxin levels.

The fungi persist and multiply on infected crop residues. During moist weather, spores of the fungi are windblown or splashed onto the heads of cereal crops. Stress conditions and lesions caused by other fungi or insects are known to increase susceptibility of host plants. Disease management generally includes timely fungicide applications, crop rotation with non-hosts, and crop varieties with reduced susceptibility. Use of certified clean seeds is essential.

New fungal strains are emerging worldwide, and continued breeding for new resistant varieties is needed to stay ahead of pathogen evolution. Re-emergence of some of the fusarium diseases thought to be driven mainly by changes to climate and agronomic practices has been reported (for example, ProMED-mail post 20100726.2497). In Canada, the emergence of a new fusarium head blight (FHB) strain of wheat with increased mycotoxin levels has been reported earlier (ProMED-mail post 20091210.4211).
