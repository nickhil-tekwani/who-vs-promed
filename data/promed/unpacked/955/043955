["Across Europe, HPAI continues to be reported in domestic poultry and non-poultry species, including wild birds."

"Between 7 Nov and 6 Dec 2022, there has been a total of 299 HPAI H5N1 events reported by the WOAH in domestic poultry and non-poultry including wild birds across Europe. Of these, 129 outbreaks were reported in domestic poultry in: Belgium (1), Czech Republic (1), Denmark (1), France (46), Germany (6), Hungary (45), Italy (20), Moldova (1), the Netherlands (4), Norway (1), the Republic of Ireland (2) and Russia (1). The remaining 170 events were reported in non-poultry/wild birds in: Austria (1), Belgium (29), Denmark (5), France (50), Germany (28), Italy (21), North Macedonia (1), Norway (3), Poland (1), Portugal (1), Republic of Ireland (3), Romania (4), Russia (2), Serbia and Montenegro (2), Slovenia (2), Spain (13), Sweden (2) and Switzerland (2)."

"The number of outbreaks of HPAI in poultry farms each week across Europe has increased over the last 4 weeks, however the number of cases in wild birds appears to have decreased over the same time period. It is important to note that wild bird surveillance methods may differ between countries and may contribute to the variability in the number of wild birds reported each week".
