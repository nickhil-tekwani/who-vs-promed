Malaria increases in Kyrgyzstan
----------------------------------
According to the Epidemiology Surveillance Department (ESD) of
Kyrgyztan, 156 cases of malaria have been recorded as of 11 Aug
2003, among which were 106 in Batken oblast, 7 in the City of
Bishkek, and 1 in the City of Osh.

According to ESD, a number of factors account for the current
epidemiologic situation, such as large-scale migration of the
population, economic relationships with neighboring Central Asian
countries where malaria is endemic (such as Tajikistan), and lack of
funding for insecticides against malaria transmitters.

Because of the complicated situation regarding malaria, a regional
office of WHO has been opened in Osh. 500 kilograms of
insecticides were given to Kyrgyzstan by WHO, and in June 2003,
those insecticides were used against mature mosquitoes in southern
parts of the country.

A biologic method is also being used in the fight against malaria;
gambusia is a small fish that feeds on the larval form of mosquitoes.

The French non-governmental organization "Akted" is distributing
health information on malaria prevention among the population of
Batken oblast. However, the humanitarian aid received thus far is not
sufficient to achieve complete protection from malaria. There is an
acute lack of insecticides, laboratory equipment, and diagnostic
agents.

[The highest potential for malaria exists in the southern regions of
the country, including the Osh, Batken, and Jalal-Abad areas,
primarily due to the many rice plantations [where the vectors breed].
Malaria vectors in these areas include several species of
Anopheles: _An. pulcherrimus_, _An. superpictus_, _An.
hyrcanus_, _An. martinius_, _An. claviger_, and _An. messeae_.
The malaria situation deteriorated in Kyrgyzstan beginning with an
outbreak during the transmission season of 2002. By mid-October
of that year, 2267 autochthonous malaria (_P. vivax_) cases had
been reported. In 2001, the total number reported was 15 (Source:
<http://www.who.dk/eprise/main/WHO/Progs/MAL/NewsEvents/20020827_2>).

Roll Back Malaria statistics show that malaria was eradicated in
Kyrgyzstan in 1959. However, from 1986 onwards, as a result of the
importation of malaria by ex-service military upon return from
Afghanistan, some local cases were registered. In 1986 and 1987,
14 and 10 autochthonous malaria cases (respectively) were
detected. In 1988, there were 21 cases due to local transmission,
with 11 registered in the Batken district, which borders Tajikistan and
Uzbekistan. In the years that followed (including 1995), only imported
cases were reported. In 1996, after 7 years with no locally
transmitted cases, the first case of autochthonous malaria was
registered in the Panfilov district. Since then, despite the
reduction in imported malaria, there has been a rise in the number of
autochthonous malaria cases. - Mod.EP]
