Rate of echinococcosis in Karachayevo-Cherkesovo 22 times higher than in
Russian Federation
--------------------------------------------------
High rates of the dangerous parasitic infection echinococcosis have been
observed in Karachayevo-Cherkesovo. The Chief of the parasitology
department, N. Melihkhova, reported that the incidence rate of
echinococcosis is 22 times higher than in the Russian Federation. Though
the Ministry of Public Health in Karachayevo-Cherkesovo is not taking any
extraordinary measures, specialists claim that if there are no organized
centers for diagnosis and treatment of echinococcosis, there is the danger
that the disease could spread.

[We presume that the message concerns _Echinococcus granulosus_ (hydatid
disease). The main host is the dog; adult larvae live in the intestine and
infective eggs are shed in feces. Humans and other animals -- in Russia,
especially sheep -- can be infected by ingestion of eggs, which develop
into the larval stage typically in the liver. The larval stage is
characterized by cysts filled with fluid. The diagnosis is by ultrasound or
other scans and detection of specific antibodies. - Mod.EP]
