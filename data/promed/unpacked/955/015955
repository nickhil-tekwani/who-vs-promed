Summary, week 11/2013
---------------------
During week 11/2013, consultation rates for influenza-like illness (ILI) and/or acute respiratory infection (ARI) continued to decline throughout most parts of the WHO European Region, with most countries reporting medium activity. A few countries in the east, however, reported increasing clinical outpatient activity. The percentage of sentinel specimens testing positive for influenza has started to decline overall, but remains high in several countries. While pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B co-dominate in northern and western Europe, A(H1N1)pdm09 is the dominant virus in the central and eastern parts of the Region. The number of hospitalizations due to severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) decreased slightly in week 11/2013, but some eastern countries reported increased influenza-positivity rates among SARI cases, in line with increases in ARI/ILI consultation rates.
Virological surveillance for influenza
-------------------------------
During week 11/2013 a total of 4821 specimens tested positive for influenza, with 2783 (58 percent) positive for influenza A. The proportion of influenza A viruses has continued to decrease since week 03/2013, when it was 76 percent of influenza-positive specimens.

As in previous weeks, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 remained the dominant type A virus in the Region: of 1639 subtyped, 1016 (62 percent) were A(H1N1)pdm09 and 623 (38 percent) were A(H3N2). Since the beginning of the season (week 40/2012), 78 182 influenza viruses from sentinel and non-sentinel sources have been detected and typed. Since week 47/2012, influenza A has been the most commonly detected virus: cumulatively, 51 113 (65 percent) were influenza A and 27 069 (35 percent) influenza B (Fig. 2b).


Of the 32 806 influenza A viruses that have been subtyped, 23 002 (70 percent) were A(H1N1)pdm09 and 9 804 (30 percent) were A(H3N2). In addition, the lineage for 4065 influenza B viruses has been determined: 3720 (92 percent) belonged to the B/Yamagata lineage and 345 (8 percent) to B/Victoria.

Circulation of influenza viruses in week 11/2013 remained diverse across the Region, with more northern and western countries reporting the dominance of influenza B or co-circulation of influenza A and B. Influenza A was reported as the dominant virus mainly by countries in eastern and central Europe, as well as in Greece, Ireland and the United Kingdom (England, Wales and Northern Ireland).

Virus strain characterizations
------------------------
For the 2012/2013 northern hemisphere influenza season, the WHO recommends inclusion of A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like, A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2)-like and B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like (from the B/Yamagata lineage) viruses in vaccines (see more at the WHO headquarters web site). For the recommendations for the 2013/2014 northern hemisphere influenza season (see the WHO headquarters web site).

Monitoring of susceptibility to antiviral drugs
--------------------------------------
Cumulatively since week 40/2012, 12 countries (Denmark, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, the Russian Federation, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) have screened 967 viruses for susceptibility to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir. Of the 442 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses tested, 433 showed susceptibility to both drugs while 9 viruses (2 percent) carrying the neuraminidase H275Y amino acid substitution, causing resistance to oseltamivir, were detected. Of these 9 viruses, one from the Russian Federation was detected in a hospitalized patient not exposed to oseltamivir through treatment; 2 viruses from the United Kingdom were detected in outpatients not exposed to oseltamivir through treatment; and 6 viruses were detected in hospitalized immunocompromised patients exposed to oseltamivir through treatment (one from Denmark, 2 from Germany, 2 from the Netherlands and one from Switzerland).

The 233 influenza A(H3N2) viruses tested showed susceptibility to both drugs. Of the 292 influenza B viruses tested, 291 showed susceptibility to both drugs; one virus showing reduced inhibition for oseltamivir, and normal inhibition for zanamivir, was detected in the United Kingdom in an outpatient without exposure to antiviral treatment. There is no indication of the spread of resistant viruses.

The 44 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 19 influenza A(H3N2) viruses screened for susceptibility to adamantanes were found to be resistant.

Outpatient surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI) and/or acute respiratory infection (ARI)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A few countries, mainly in the eastern part of the Region, reported increasing influenza activity for week 11/2013 (Map 4). In week 11/2013, only 1 (Bosnia and Herzegovina) reported high intensity, in contrast to 4 countries during week 10/2013. At the same time, most countries continued reporting widespread/regional circulation of influenza.

Of the countries that have established epidemic thresholds, 4 (the Czech Republic, France, Israel and Kazakhstan) reported ILI/ARI consultation rates below their national threshold levels.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
---------------------------
Based on the data presented by countries reporting on RSV, the positivity rate peaked in week 52/2012, after which the number of detections has continued to decrease gradually.

[During the same period influenza activity in North America and Mexico continued to decrease overall. The proportion of influenza B has increased in the United States of America (USA), but influenza A(H3N2) still remained the most commonly detected virus. The season in the USA has been more severe than any since 2003-4, as reflected in numbers of pneumonia and influenza deaths, and the burden has been greatest in individuals over the age of 65 years. Activity in Mexico has also decreased over the past several weeks since peaking in mid to late January.
