A monkey at the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (NBACC) at Fort Detrick [Maryland, USA] tested positive for the bacteria that cause tuberculosis [_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_], according to a news release from the agency.

The animal, a crab-eating macaque, was the same species as 5 other monkeys found with the tuberculosis bacteria at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID). That agency, also at Fort Detrick, identified the disease among the animals and one human caretaker earlier in April [2018].

No human employees at NBACC have tested positive for tuberculosis, according the release. Staff members who come into contact with laboratory animals are tested for the disease every 6 months.

The agency has informed its employees of the test results. It also informed the Frederick County Health Department, the Maryland Department of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

The monkey was one of 2 macaques kept together at the agency [NBACC] since 2012 and used for training purposes.

Unlike one of the macaques at USAMRIID, which was identified through a neck lesion, the monkey at NBACC showed no outward signs of disease.

The monkey and its cage-mate were tested as a precaution after USAMRIID announced that animals had been found with tuberculosis, according to the release.

The macaques had previously been screened for the disease through a skin test, but NBACC also tested the animals with an IgG serum blood test, a more recent and sensitive diagnostic method.

Only one of the macaques at NBACC tested positive for tuberculosis bacteria. The agency could not determine whether the monkey had contracted the disease at an earlier date and recovered or whether it had latent tuberculosis, during which the disease is present, but inactive in the body.

Both animals were euthanized as a precaution, according to the release. Necropsies will be performed at a later date.

NBACC and USAMRIID obtain laboratory animals from different suppliers, but tuberculosis is not unheard of among primates imported to the United States for research.

Previous studies have found that the tuberculosis skin test, long used as a screening method for lab animals, is not effective at detecting latent cases of the disease.

USAMRIID will also incorporate IgG serum screens into its testing plan for crab-eating macaques, according to spokeswoman Caree Vander Linden. The agency is still testing other laboratory monkeys and human employees. Those tests should be concluded by the middle of May 2018, Vander Linden said.

Primates imported into the U.S. for research are subject to strict quarantine and medical requirements, according to the CDC. Monkeys must be quarantined for 31 days after their arrival at the importer's quarantine facility.

Each primate must also have 3 consecutive negative tests for tuberculosis infection, given at least 2 weeks apart, before being released from quarantine, according to a statement from the agency.

[Both the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (NBACC) and U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) are located in Frederick, Maryland. Frederick, a city in western Maryland, can be found on a map at: https://www.google.com/maps/place/Frederick,+MD.

The following is a description of the NBACC from their website (https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/national-biodefense-analysis-and-countermeasures-center): "The National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (NBACC) is a one-of-a-kind facility dedicated to defending the nation against biological threats. Its work supports intelligence assessments, preparedness planning, response, emerging threat characterization, and bioforensic analyses. It is the 1st national laboratory created by DHS, and the capabilities within the facility did not exist prior to the Amerithrax attacks of 2001.

"Since its inception, NBACC and its staff of more than 150 dedicated employees have filled critical shortfalls in our scientific knowledge of biological agents needed to defend the public from acts of terrorism."

The following is a description of the USAMRIID from their website (http://www.usamriid.army.mil/aboutpage.htm): "Since 1969, USAMRIID has served as the Department of Defense's (DoD) lead laboratory for medical biological defense research. While our core mission is to protect the warfighter from biological threats, we also investigate disease outbreaks and threats to public health. Research conducted at USAMRIID leads to medical solutions -- therapeutics, vaccines, diagnostics, and information -- that benefit both military personnel and civilians. USAMRIID is a subordinate laboratory of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command."

ProMED-mail previously reported that one of the macaques at USAMRIID died and was found to have tuberculosis at autopsy. At the time, several other laboratory macaques tested positive for latent tuberculosis.

We are now told in the news report above that a macaque at NBACC also tested positive for latent tuberculosis. NBACC and USAMRIID are said to obtain laboratory animals from different suppliers.

We are told above that research laboratory macaques are routinely screened for tuberculosis by the CDC quarantine facility and must have 3 consecutive negative tests at least 2 weeks apart before being released from quarantine; the usual screening method is the tuberculin skin test (TST). But NBACC also tested their macaques with an "IgG serum blood test, a more recent and sensitive diagnostic method," the implication being that the previous TSTs may have been falsely negative, so that tuberculosis may have been present in the macaques before their arrival at the facilities. The type of serum test is not stated, but perhaps is the Interferon Gamma Release Assay or IGRA.

USAMRIID and NBACC say that they will now incorporate the "IgG serum testing" into an ongoing testing plan for macaques and apparently for the employees. It is hoped that the results of the serum tests, and results of concurrent TSTs for comparison, will be available in the near future. - Mod.ML]

[Infection of animals with normally human strains of _M. tuberculosis_ is not that unusual. In the days of rampant human HIV, stockmen would infect dairy cows. An infection of a laboratory monkey raises all sorts of questions of biosecurity. - Mod.MHJ
