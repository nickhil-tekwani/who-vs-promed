Mystery shrouds post-operative complications of women after delivery at the Gynaecology Department of Mata Kaushalya Hospital [located in Patiala, Punjab, India]. One such case is of a 25 year old woman, who lost her life during treatment at the Government Rajindra Hospital [Patiala] after she was referred from the Government Mata Kaushalya Hospital [Patiala].

Last week [week of 26 Jul 2021], a woman with similar symptoms was referred to the PGIMER, Chandigarh [Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) is a public tertiary care university hospital in Chandigarh (capital of Punjab and Haryana), which caters to patients from all over Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, and Haryana (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir_(union_territory)) - Mod.ML]. A health condition of anuria, wherein kidneys stop producing urine, is continually being reported in post-delivery cases of young women.

Sources informed that around 5 cases with similar symptoms had already been reported within 15 days. After the unusual postoperative complications, the department had to shut the operation theatre (OT) for 72 hours last week. To mitigate the source of infection, insecticide was sprayed in the labour room, ward, and the OT.

The hospital authorities also checked laundry, drugs, and other things at the department. However, they were still clueless about how the infection was spreading. Dr Aarti Pandove, senior medical officer, Mata Kaushalya Hospital, said, "We have been trying our best to identify the problem. We have already checked everything. However, we have not been able to identify reasons so far." Dr Pandove further said that they were in contact with the PGIMER, Chandigarh, in this regard.

Two of the 5 women, who showed similar symptoms, were found positive for scrub typhus, the sources added. Scrub typhus, known as bush typhus, is a disease caused by bacteria called _Orientia tsutsugamushi_. It spreads among people through bites of infected chiggers (larval mites). However, the hospital authorities claimed that only one patient was found positive for scrub typhus.

Meanwhile, a health official said, "An inquiry should be conducted into the death of a woman and other cases to avoid any further loss of life in the future."

[We are told in the news report above that 5 post-partum women presented within the past 15 days with similar symptoms. They were thought to have an "infection" that was accompanied by "anuria". They were also said to be "post-operative", although the specific operation is not disclosed. Perhaps they had a Caesarean section. One of the 5 patients has died.

One or 2 of the 5 postpartum patients were diagnosed as having scrub typhus, but we are not told how the diagnosis was made. The Weil-Felix test is commonly used to make the diagnosis of rickettsial infections, including scrub typhus, in resource-limited areas where more current diagnostic methods are not available (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559225/). The Weil-Felix test is an agglutination reaction based on the fact that certain serotypes of _Proteus_ bacteria display antigenic cross-reactivity with _Rickettsia_ species. This test has largely been replaced due to its low sensitivity and specificity with new serological techniques. For example, false positive results have been seen in 54% of healthy volunteers and 62% of non-rickettsial fever patients with the Weil-Felix test (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23763648_Validity_of_the_Weil-Felix_test_in_the_diagnosis_of_acute_rickettsial_infections_in_Sri_Lanka).

The gold standard for diagnosis of rickettsial infections is indirect immunofluorescent IgG antibody assays of paired serum samples (one taken during the acute phase of the disease and one taken 2 to 4 weeks later in the convalescent phase) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559225/). Results from a single acute serum sample are unreliable, as it takes 7-10 days for IgG antibody to be detectable, and antibody will be present in a high percentage of healthy people in an endemic region like India.

Infection that occurs soon after childbirth is known as puerperal or postpartum sepsis. Group A streptococcus (GAS, _S. pyogenes_) is an important cause of outbreaks of puerperal sepsis and can occur when GAS is introduced into the uterus by contaminated hands or surgical or delivery instruments. Other organisms, such as Gram negative bacilli, Group B streptococci (_Streptococcus agalactiae_), and _Staphylococcus aureus_, can cause puerperal sepsis. A fall in urinary output (oliguria) suggests severe sepsis, as a consequence of acute kidney injury, possibly a result of bacteremia. Perhaps this outbreak is due to the infusion of a contaminated intravenous solution. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
