[This is the 2nd part of the daily update following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on selected countries of interest.
To reduce the size of these posts, there will be changes over the coming days. The tables will be reduced but are available at the source URLs and will be referred to in the summaries of daily changes for each country. Countries that have almost interrupted transmission and have been lifting restrictions (China, South Korea) and have lessons to learn as they attempt to prevent explosive 2nd waves will continue to be profiled. We will attempt to select countries from each region when feasible. - Mod.MPP]

[According to the report above, in the past 24 hours there have been 5 newly confirmed cases in China, all imported. No new deaths were reported. 6 new cases were reported in Hong Kong, none in Macau or Taiwan. A total of 1768 imported cases have been reported. The imported cases were 4 in Shanghai municipality and 1 in Sichuan province. There have been no new deaths reported for several weeks, further supporting a reduced level of cases in the country.

There were 3 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals in the past 24 hours, 2 imported. There was 1 case of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The previous report of a conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic was on 1 Jun 2020 when 2 conversions were reported. Prior to that a single case was reported on 18 May 2020 (COVID-19 update (194): China, S Korea, countries w/ high local trans, Italy phase 2 20200519.7352327).

Recurrent questions are, what is the total number of asymptomatic cases? What is the total number of symptomatic cases that converted to symptomatic? What is the proportion of asymptomatic imported cases that have been linked to transmission chains resulting in outbreak clusters?

The previous day's (3 Jun 2020) 24-hour change was 321 cases and 71 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are also in decline.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country (see table at http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4856_1_file.pdf), in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont, and Liguria. These 4 provinces combined today (4 Jun 2020) account for 83% of reported newly confirmed cases (a decrease from 84.7% reported yesterday 3 Jun 2020) in the past 24 hours. Lombardy again reported the most newly confirmed cases in the 24 hour period (84), and the only province reporting more than 50 new cases. 16 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (9 provinces reported no new cases), another 4 provinces reported fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission.

The top 5 provinces by cumulative case count are Lombardy, followed by Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Tuscany. The top 5 provinces by number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours are Lombardy (84), followed by Piedmont (24), Liguria (21), Emilia-Romagna (18), and Lazio (11).

Italy is now 31 days post phase 2 initial opening up, and 15 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up. All eyes are now on Italy as lockdown restrictions are phased out.

[4] Iran: 164 270 total cases, 8071 deaths

Iran on Thursday [4 Jun 2020] witnessed a record daily rise in COVID-19 cases amid the continuing resurgence of the coronavirus pandemic, while China delivered another batch of medical aid to help Syria fight the COVID-19. The total number of COVID-19 cases surged to 164 270 in Iran with 3574 new ones reported. The death toll in Iran, the highest in the Middle East, climbed to 8071 after 59 more deaths were reported.

So far, 127 485 patients in Iran have recovered and 2569 others remain in critical condition, said Kianush Jahanpur, head of Public Relations and Information Center of the Ministry of Health and Medical Education.

Some Iranian officials warned that a 2nd wave of infections might be underway. In an article published on Iran's daily Arman Melli, Minister of Health and Medical Education Saeed Namaki criticized some people for "ignoring health protocols in domestic flights and in the holy shrines." The minister also blasted some officials for trying to picture a "normalization of situation" in the country despite the raging coronavirus pandemic.

[As of 4 Jun 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 164 270, including 8071 deaths, an increase of 3574 cases and 59 deaths since 2 Jun 2020, an increase in daily newly confirmed cases from 3134 newly confirmed cases and a decrease in deaths from the 70 deaths reported in the preceding 24 hour period. Iran has started relaxing restrictions on a more widespread basis in the country. With the increasing daily case reports almost approaching the prior peak in late March-early April 2020, it is clear there is now a 2nd wave most likely due to too early lifting of restrictions.

The daily number of newly confirmed cases has reached an all-time high since the epidemic began in Iran.
