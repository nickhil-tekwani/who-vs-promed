Yelm Community Schools (YCS) has experienced an increase in student absences likely linked to the norovirus, which is a gastrointestinal illness. YCS Superintendent Brian Wharton sent out an email to the district's families this week urging parents to keep their children at home if they display symptoms of the illness, which include a sudden onset of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramping and/or fever.

"At the end of last week, we noticed an increase in student absences related to gastrointestinal illness," stated the email. "Thurston County Public Health and Social Services has advised us that norovirus is likely causing the illness, although other disease-causing organisms, including COVID-19, may be responsible."

Norovirus is a "very contagious virus that causes vomiting and diarrhea," according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s website. "Anyone can get infected and sick with norovirus. You can get norovirus from having direct contact with an infected person, consuming contaminated food or water, or touching contaminated surfaces and putting your unwashed hand in your mouth."

If a person's child experiences symptoms, they can return to school once they are diarrhea-free for 48 hours, fever-free without medication for 24 hours, and following a school administered rapid test for COVID-19, according to the email.

Wharton also noted that as a precaution, the district has thoroughly cleaned the impacted school according to COVID-19 health and safety guidelines. "We appreciate your cooperation and remind students to check Google Classroom for missed assignments when home ill," stated the email.

[Norovirus can be transmitted by:

- Eating food or drink liquids that are contaminated with norovirus,
- Touching surfaces or objects contaminated with norovirus and then putting your fingers in your mouth, or
- Having direct contact with someone who is infected with norovirus, such as by caring for them or sharing food or eating utensils with them.

The 1st sign of norovirus is usually a sudden sick feeling, followed by forceful vomiting and watery diarrhea. Some people may also have a raised temperature (over 38 C/100.4 F), headaches, stomach cramps, and aching limbs. Symptoms usually appear 1 or 2 days after exposure to infection, but they can start sooner. Most people make a full recovery within a few days. Apart from the risk of dehydration, the illness is not generally dangerous, and there are usually no long-lasting effects from norovirus infection.

Yelm is a city in Thurston County, Washington, in the west-central part of the state. The word "Yelm" is said to come from the Coast Salish word shelm or chelm, meaning "heat waves from the sun," referring to heat mirages (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yelm,_Washington). - Mod.LL
