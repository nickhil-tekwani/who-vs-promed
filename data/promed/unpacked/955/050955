In Cochabamba, 4 [canine] rabies cases were reported in just one day,
2 in the Avenida Petrolera area, one in the Tiquipaya municipality,
and the other in the Maica area. In the case of the dogs with rabies
in the Avenida Petrolera, in the Cercado municipality, one of them
attacked its owner who is now under observation and treatment to avoid
possible fatal consequences.

The [official] responsible for the rabies program in the departmental
[state or province equivalent] Health Services (SEDES), Libertad
Lujan, stated that from January to date [2011], there is a total of 67
canine rabies cases and the death of a girl with human rabies who died
this past April [2011].

As for the 4 new [canine] cases registered in the Avenida Petrolera,
Tiquipaya y Maica, attacks by dogs with rabies signs were reported in
Avenida America, north of the city of Cochabamba. "The Zoonosis Unit
is following up with the hunt for rabid dogs; meanwhile the patient
who was bitten is receiving treatment to avoid health complications. A
dog with rabies signs attacked 6 people near Avenida America and
another 2 dogs bit occasional passersby in the bus station and the La
Pampa market," she added. Lujan stated that [the] Zoonosis [Unit]
completed its work of trapping animals to block the related [rabies]
focus, although she recommended that the population be careful of dogs
suspected of having rabies. She mentioned that no cases had occurred
for a long time in Maica, making it necessary to declare a health
emergency to avoid an explosive outbreak of the disease in dogs as
well as in humans.

According to Lujan, to avoid the spread of the fatal disease in humans
and dogs, this Sun 2 Oct 2011, from 8:00-16:00 hours, a vaccination
campaign will begin for more than 600 000 dogs, which is the estimated
canine population in the city and provinces of Cochabamba.

[The rabies problem in both dogs and humans continues in Cochabamba
department in this year (2011) (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20110821.2543). The decision to launch a massive canine vaccination in
the department is prudent. One hopes that this effort will provide a
high degree of coverage of the canine population there.

An aggressive vaccination campaign will be more successful in halting
rabies spread than culling stray dogs would be. Canine rabies cases
have also bee reported in Oruro, La Paz, and Santa Cruz departments
this year (2011). - Mod. TY]
