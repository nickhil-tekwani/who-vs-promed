Experts of the International Scientific Working Group on Tick-Borne
Encephalitis (ISW-TBE) have been warning of the dangers of tick-borne
encephalitis (TBE). Now, hikers are among those in danger, because
tick [numbers] have been climbing higher.

The year 2008 marked the 1st time that ticks infected with the TBE
virus were detected at more than 1500 meters above sea level, one of
the consequences of global warming. The ISW-TBE has been calling for
vaccination against TBE to become a standard preventive measure for
everybody traveling to endemic regions.

For travelers, failing to undergo preventive vaccination may have
far-reaching consequences. TBE, a viral disease transmitted by ticks,
affects the central nervous system. Its diverse forms of expression
range from minor neurological dysfunction to impaired concentration,
depression, severe paralysis, or even death.

"Since 1990, more than 157 500 cases of TBE have been registered in
Europe, corresponding to 8755 cases annually. Its climatic conditions
make Austria a high-risk country for TBE. Because vaccination
coverage in Austria is exceptionally high, the number of TBE cases
has come down from 677 in 1979 to 86 in 2008," explains Professor
Jochen Suss, Friedrich-Loffler-Institute, Jena. "At a European
level," says Professor Pier Luigi Lopalco from the European Centre
for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), "TBE is not yet a
notifiable disease. However, we have been working to raise awareness
of the dangers of TBE to motivate people to get vaccinated." Once
infected, there is no [specific] treatment available.

[According to the CDC Special Pathogens Branch website, tick-borne
encephalitis (TBE) is a human viral infectious disease involving the
central nervous system. The disease is most often manifest as
meningitis (inflammation of the membrane that surrounds the brain and
spinal cord), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), or
meningoencephalitis (inflammation of both the brain and meninges).
Although TBE is most commonly recognized as a neurologic disease,
mild febrile illnesses can also occur. Long-lasting or permanent
neuropsychiatric sequelae are observed in 10-20 percent of infected
patients. TBE is caused by tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), a
member of the family _Flaviviridae_. A closely related virus in Far
Eastern Eurasia, Russian spring-summer encephalitis virus (RSSEV), is
responsible for a similar disease with a more severe clinical course.

Ticks act as both the vector and reservoir for TBEV. The main hosts
are small rodents, with humans being accidental hosts. Large animals
are feeding hosts for the ticks, but do not play a role in maintenance
of the virus. The virus can chronically infect ticks and is
transmitted both transtadially (from larva to nymph to adult ticks)
and transovarially (from adult female tick through eggs). TBE cases
occur during the highest period of tick activity (between April and
November), when humans are infected in rural areas through tick bites.
Infection also may follow consumption of raw milk from [infected]
goats, sheep, or cows. Laboratory infections were common before the
use of vaccines and availability of biosafety precautions to prevent
exposure to infectious aerosols. Person-to-person transmission has not
been reported. Vertical transmission from an infected mother to fetus
has occurred.

TBE is an important infectious disease in many parts of Europe, the
former Soviet Union, and Asia, corresponding to the distribution of
the ixodid tick reservoir.
