15 people were injured when a stray cow attacked them near a bus
stand in the Indian state of Goa. This happened on Wednesday morning
last week [14 Jul 2010]. The incident occurred when the people, who
were standing near the bus stand, were attacked by the cow, which
went wild. The Bicholim Municipal Council (BMC) employees along with
the members of Animal Rescue Squad Bicholim caught the cow, which
died later due to rabies. It was learned later that the cow had been
bitten by a rabid dog.

Residents of Bicholim have requested BMC authorities to keep control
over the menace of stray cattle and dogs in its jurisdiction.

[The clinical features of rabies are similar in most species, but
there is great variation between individuals. Two clinical forms of
the disease are recognised: furious and dumb (paralytic) rabies. A
higher proportion of dogs, cats, and horses exhibit the furious form
than is the case for cattle, other ruminants and rodents and similar
laboratory animal species. In this instance, the affected cow
displayed signs of the furious form of rabies. It is unclear whether
the cow, a sacred animal in India, died as a result of the disease or
was euthanised.

The extent of the injuries sustained by the 15 people at the bus
station is not stated, but it is presumed that they all received
post-exposure prophylaxis by administration of anti-rabies
immunoglobulin and anti-rabies vaccination.

In a study of rabies in southern India, Nagaraja et al (Infect.
Genet. Evol. 2009 Sep;9(5):976-82) concluded that canine rabies
strains isolated in southern India were distinguishable from rabies
virus isolates from northern India and in other parts of the world.
Nonetheless, canine rabies virus variants are the major circulating
rabies viruses, and the control of canine rabies would result in
overall reduction in the burden and incidence of rabies in India.

[Human exposure to rabies in cattle is, in most cases, the result of actions
by their handlers rather than aggressive behavior of the animals, which is
rare. In cattle, laryngeal paralysis can cause a change in vocalizations,
including an abnormal bellow, and pronounced difficulty in swallowing,
leading their handlers to suspected an obstruction of their
pharynx/esophagus and try checking their mouth to remove the (virtual)
obstructing object. This is how these humans are exposed to infection. It
will be interesting to note if brain material of the suspected cow was
laboratory tested. - Mod.AS]
