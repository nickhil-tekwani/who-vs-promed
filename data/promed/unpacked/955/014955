Epidemiological summary
-----------------------
The Zika outbreak started in October 2013 in French Polynesia and it is estimated that more than 30 000 cases have sought medical care with Zika-like symptoms there. The outbreak has since spread to other areas including a territory belonging to Chile. Public health control measures, including increased surveillance and the promotion of measures to avoid mosquito bites, have been implemented in the affected territories.

Health authorities in French Polynesia have reported a concurrent significant increase in neurological syndromes and autoimmune illnesses. There is a simultaneous dengue outbreak in the region. The cause of the complications and their possible links with [Zika virus] ZIKAV or dengue virus infections are being investigated. No neurological complications have been reported to date in the other affected areas.

ECDC assessment
---------------
ZIKAV infection continues to spread to new areas in the Pacific. There is a risk for the disease spreading further both in the Pacific and to the countries of the Americas where the _Aedes_ mosquito is present, and for sporadic imported cases in Europe from endemic areas. Vigilance must be enhanced towards imported cases of ZIKAV infection in the EU Member States and EU overseas countries and territories and outermost regions, in particular where effective vectors are present. Early detection of cases is essential to reduce the risk of autochthonous transmission. Clinicians and medical travel clinics should be aware of the situation in the Pacific islands and include ZIKAV infection in their differential diagnosis.

There is no available vaccine against ZIKAV infection. Travellers can protect themselves by preventing mosquito bites.

ZIKAV infection is a mild illness and has not been known to have neurological complications. The reported complications in French Polynesia are not confirmed to be caused by ZIKAV infections. However, there is a temporal association with the simultaneous outbreaks of ZIKAV and dengue [DENV]. It is important to determine the cause of this increase and a possible association with the ongoing transmission of DENV-1, DENV-3, and ZIKAV.

[Zika virus transmission continues in French Polynesia and New Caledonia and most recently, Easter Island. Given mobility of people around and from the islands, it would not be surprising if Zika virus appears in other localities.
