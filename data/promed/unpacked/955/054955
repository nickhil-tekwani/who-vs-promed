Norwalk-like Virus Outbreak Closes 7 Wards at Hull Royal Infirmary
------------------------------------------------------------------
Hull Royal Infirmary has suspended admissions to 7 wards and cancelled
non-urgent surgery following the outbreak of "winter vomiting" disease.
About 60 patients and 23 members of staff have reported symptoms of the
gastrointestinal virus [Norwalk-like virus] since Fri 31 May 2002. All are
said to be recovering well from the illness, which is described as "mild but
contagious." One ward at Castle Hill Hospital in Cottingham has also stopped
admitting any new patients.
The Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust said in a statement: "The
virus, which is very common in the community, causes diarrhoea and vomiting
for 24 to 48 hours. It is a mild but contagious illness that is spread by
air and contact. All appropriate infection control procedures are in place
and the hospital's infection control team is closely monitoring the
situation. Non-urgent operations will be cancelled for the rest of the
week."

[As mentioned in prior comments, one wonders if there is something
different about this year's strain of Norwalk-like virus (NLV), perhaps an
increased virulence (lower infective dose necessary). Or perhaps there is
just increased surveillance this year for hospital closures.
I donÂ´t remember another year in the past 4 with so many hospital closures
due to NLV (or other gastroenteritis outbreaks). This, combined with the
outbreak in British troops in Afghanistan (which included medics as well)
suggests that something different is going on here with the strain of NLV in
circulation in the UK. Perhaps this latest strain is less easily transmitted
through droplet/aerosolization, which would explain the sudden "bursts" of
the outbreak (common source) that then quietly disappear due to reduced
person-to-person secondary transmission. Or the reverse: perhaps primary
transmission is through droplet/ aerosolization; so it circulates for a week
or so (very rapidly) until it burns out (explaining the high attack rate in
hospital staff, especially the medics responsible for the transport of cases
medivac'd from Afghanistan). These outbreaks seem to burn out fairly quickly
(the average outbreak described seems to have a life-span of approximately
7-10 days) but this may be only an anecdotal impression. - Mod.MPP]
