SWINE FEVER THREATENS W. AFRICAN PIG POPULATION-FAO
Feb. 16 /98
ROME -- The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) was cited as saying
today that a serious outbreak of African Swine Fever threatens to wipe out
the pig population of Cape Verde and action is urgently needed to help
prevent the disease spreading to other West African countries.
FAO animal health expert Kris Wojciechowski, just returned from Cape Verde,
was quoted as saying, "If the disease spreads throughout the country, almost
all the swine population could perish. This would be a real catastrophe
because pork makes up half the meat produced by the country and is a basic
element in the food security of the poor segments of the population."
The story notes that there is no vaccine against African Swine Fever, a
highly contagious viral disease of domestic pigs which can cause 100 percent
mortality in initial widespread outbreaks.
The only defence against its spread is to destroy all the swine in the
infected area under sanitary conditions and to quarantine pig farms in
neighbouring regions, according to FAO.

[Unfortunately, this report tells us nothing more than that FAO reads and
sometimes acts on OIE reports. One can hope that the veterinary
investigators will find out how the infection reached the islands and how it
managed to become so established necessitating the potential draconian
response. - Mod.MHJ
