At least 12 dolphins were found dead on the beaches of Achill Island [County Mayo] over the past 2 days [31 Jan-1 Feb 2013].

Most of the common dolphins had died recently and were washed up on Keel Strand, Dookinella, and Keem Bay.

The local council has buried some of the creatures, according to the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group's [IWDG] spokesperson John O'Shea.

Although a biopsy would be required to figure out exact cause of death, recent storms may have been a factor. "While there are occasionally live strandings involving groups of dolphins, it is very unusual in this country to see this number of dead dolphins washed ashore over a 10 km [6.2 mi] area," the IWDG said in a statement online.

O'Shea said a pod of dolphins is currently situated in quite shallow water between Achillbeg and Cloch Mor.

[It seems that no post mortem exam was carried out, and therefore the chances of unveiling the cause of death are remote. Mass strandings of cetaceans are considered to be due to a complex set of variables in which behavioral factors are probably important. In these phenomena, there are interactions of physical conditions (weather, tides, currents, coastline) and biological conditions (predators, feeding, disturbance of echolocation, and disease).

A known infectious cause of death in dolphins is infection by dolphin morbillivirus (DMV).
