No anthrax found in exposed UNM labs
-----------------------------------------
No anthrax was found in the rooms where a anthrax-positive research
rabbit lived at the University of New Mexico, the State Department of
Health said this morning [22 Nov 2007]. Swabs taken Friday [16 Nov
2007] from rooms exposed to the laboratory rabbit, exposed to a wild
strain of anthrax, showed no traces of the bacteria, said department
spokeswoman Deborah Busemeyer.

Still, 2 employees who had contact with the rabbit were given
antibiotics that are used to treat infections caused by exposure to
anthrax, which can be passed from animal to human.

About 20 UNM laboratory workers were also to be given antibiotics as
a precaution, said Sam Giammo, a UNM Health Sciences Center spokesman.

[We apologize for the late reporting of this event but Thanksgiving
casts a long shadow.

Environmental swabs would not be expected to show anything in a
properly run laboratory animal facility; i.e., it would be clean.
However one should note that this summer we tried out a commercial
anthrax spore test kit in 4 US states and 3 Canadian provinces and it
totally failed to come up with a single positive in situations where
B. anthracis was demonstrated by the US Navy field ELISA test kit and
by culture. So until more details are made available as to how this
facility was tested, we can only take their results on face value.
Other enquiries have revealed that the 2 veterinarians given
antibiotics were from the NM Dept of Agriculture diagnostic
laboratory. Bureaucratic caution might recommend treating these 2,
though proper necropsy protocols would prevent any real exposure, but
the reasons for treating the 20 other staff evade me at this time.
The nature of the forensic and epidemiologic investigations into this
event are awaited. - Mod.MHJ]
