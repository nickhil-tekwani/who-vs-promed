Miyazaki government begins disposal of 12 000 chickens due to bird flu
-----------------------------------------------
The Miyazaki prefectural government on Sunday [14 Jan 2007] began
disposal of some 12 000 chickens at a poultry farm in the
southwestern Japan prefecture, after a large number of fowl there
were confirmed to have died from avian influenza.
The local government mobilized about 150 workers to dispose of all
the chickens at the farm in the town of Kiyotake, including about
3800 already dead, under the law to prevent infectious disease in livestock.
The chickens, to be killed with carbon dioxide, will be put in bags
and incinerated, while the farm will be cleaned and disinfected. The
work is expected to be completed in about 3 days.
The prefectural government plans on-site inspections of 16 other
chicken farms located within 10 km of the farm concerned to check for
any signs of the spread of avian flu.
The Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry said Saturday [13
Jan 2007] that the cause of the large number of chicken deaths at the
farm had been confirmed to be avian influenza.
The Miyazaki prefectural government the same day announced that the
type of bird flu virus had been identified as H5. The National
Institute of Animal Health in Tsukuba, Ibaraki Prefecture is testing
to determine whether the virus is the virulent H5N1 strain.
