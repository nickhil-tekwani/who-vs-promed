[The following information was obtained from The Center for food security & Public Health, Iowa State University, Fact Sheet on Eastern, Western and Venezuela equine encephalomyelitis: http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/easter_wester_venezuelan_equine_encephalomyelitis.pdf:

"Eastern, Western, and Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis are mosquito-borne, viral infections that can cause severe encephalitis in horses and humans. Some of these viruses also cause disease occasionally in other mammals and birds. No specific treatment is available, and depending on the virus and host, the case fatality rate may be as high as 90 percent.

The Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) complex contains at least 6 viral subtypes, I to VI. Subtype I, the Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus (VEEV), is divided into 5 antigenic variants or serovars, AB to F. Some of the other 5 subtypes also have official species names; subtype II is known as Everglades virus, subtype III as Mucambo virus, and subtype IV as Pixuna virus.

VEE complex viruses are divided into epizootic (or epidemic) and enzootic (or endemic) groups.

The epizootic viruses, which are amplified in equines and are responsible for most epidemics, are found in VEEV subtypes I-AB and I-C. The remaining viruses, including VEEV I-D, VEEV I-E and variants in subtypes II-VI are enzootic (sylvatic) subtypes. These viruses are generally found in limited geographic areas, where they usually occur in natural cycles between rodents and mosquitoes. The enzootic subtypes are typically nonpathogenic for horses and are not amplified in this host; however, in 1993, an enzootic I-E variant was responsible for an outbreak of VEE among horses in Mexico.

Epizootic VEE viruses (VEEV I-AB and I-C) are found in South and Central America. Most VEE epidemics occur in northern and western South America, but some may spread into adjacent countries, including the U.S. Enzootic VEE viruses have been found in Mexico, parts of the U.S., and South and Central America.

Enzootic VEE viruses usually cycle between mosquitoes in the genus _Culex_ and sylvatic rodents or marsupials. Birds are involved in a few cycles. Humans and horses are incidental (dead end) hosts for the enzootic subtypes.

In humans, VEE is usually an acute, often mild, systemic illness. The clinical signs may include fever, chills, generalized malaise, severe headache, photophobia and myalgia particularly in the legs and lumbosacral region. Coughing, sore throat, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea may also be seen. Approximately 4 percent of children develop mild to severe encephalitis; neurologic disease occurs in less than one percent of symptomatic adults. VEE usually resolves within 2 weeks, with acute symptoms subsiding after 4 to 6 days, and deaths are rare. In pregnant women, this disease can affect the fetus; fetal encephalitis, placental damage, abortion/stillbirth or severe congenital neurologic anomalies may be seen. Infections caused by enzootic VEE strains may be less virulent than those caused by epizootic viruses.

The Cayo District is the largest in Belize. It is located on the western side of the country, which borders Guatemala. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayo_District. A map of Belize can be seen at http://www.ephotopix.com/image/north_america/belize_political_map.gif.

In 2013, Guatemala reported 18 outbreaks on VEE; see Guatemala's OIE 2013 annual report at http://tinyurl.com/n7w6p5o. - Mod CRD
