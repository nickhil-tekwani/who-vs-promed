Six cases of mumps have been diagnosed in the Kimberley [in Western Australia].

"Most of the cases have been in children from 8-13 years, but we have had an adult case in the Broome area," according to the senior public health nurse. She said that mumps is not common in the highly vaccinated Kimberley population. "We haven't had a case of mumps in the Kimberley since 2009, other than a few cases in the detention centres, so this is unusual." The last outbreak started 8 years ago and infected 153 people. "This was a prolonged mumps outbreak in a vaccinated Aboriginal population. So we're concerned that we may see something similar in 2015," Ms Eastwood said.

Mumps is a virus spread via respiratory droplets and is regarded as highly infectious. "The symptoms of mumps are fever, mild chest illness, headache, and the cardinal sign is swelling of the salivary glands, lumps behind and below the jaw, and pain near the ear when chewing." While mumps typically resolves after 7-10 days, complications may include infections of the coverings of the brain, pancreatitis, permanent deafness, and painful testicular swelling.

Although the Kimberley population is highly vaccinated, it is thought that immunity declines after 5 years, making infection possible. "People who have been vaccinated who get mumps are not as unwell as people who haven't been vaccinated," the public health nurse stated.

Rates of infection by mumps have decreased by 90 per cent since vaccination was [developed] in 1967. "The rates before infection used to be 250 per 100 000 people. And that mainly occurred in children. And after the vaccination program, that's dropped to about 0.4 in a 100 000. But it just shows how infectious mumps is," said the public health nurse. The vaccine is being used as a booster to try to prevent a wider outbreak in Kimberley. "We're offering contacts of cases an additional vaccine [dose] to boost their immunity and try to control the spread of the disease."

Health authorities are asking those infected to help stem the spread of the virus. "If you have mumps, stay away from school, work and social gatherings. Tell people you've been in contact with [over] the week before that you have mumps, and tell them to go to the doctor if they get symptoms," she said.

The public health nurse said that simple hygiene is the best way people can avoid infection from the mumps virus. "Handwashing is a good way of stopping the spread of mumps, and don't share saliva by sharing eating utensils, cigarettes or kissing."

[The Kimberley is one of the 9 regions of Western Australia. It is in the northern part of Western Australia.

Mumps is a contagious disease that is caused by mumps virus. Mumps typically starts with a few days of fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite, and is followed by swelling of salivary glands. Anyone who is not immune from either previous mumps infection or from vaccination can get mumps. Before the routine vaccination was introduced, mumps was a common illness in infants, children and young adults.

Mumps is no longer very common, but outbreaks continue to occur, most commonly where people have had prolonged, close contact with a person who has mumps, such as attending the same class, playing on the same contact sports team, or living in the same accommodation with someone who has mumps. - Mod.CP
