Officials have started pulling all the fish from the lake in Banff National Park where the deadly fish parasite that causes whirling disease was 1st detected in Canada, in a bid to stop its spread.

Whirling disease now infects entire Oldman River basin, including Waterton Lakes National Park.

The disease predominantly affects trout and whitefish and can cause them to swim in a whirling pattern and die prematurely.

Whirling disease was 1st detected in Canada when it was found in Johnson Lake in August 2016, but has since been detected in the entire Bow River and watershed and the Oldman River basin in Alberta.

The ambitious measure at Johnson Lake is the best strategy to try to stop the disease from spreading into nearby Two Jack Lake and Lake Minnewanka, says Banff National Park resource conservation manager Bill Hunt. "There's only 10 core populations in all of Banff National Park for westslope cutthroat [trout]," he said. "These are some of the last pure strains of westslope anywhere in the world, and so protecting those and making sure that we do as much as we can reasonably from being severely impacted by whirling disease is a pretty high priority." Hunt says because of the whirling disease, the fish will be euthanized and disposed of safely.

The disease is caused by the microscopic parasite _Myxobolus cerebralis_.

Infected fish can also exhibit skeletal deformities and their tails can turn a darker colour, even black.

The disease is not harmful to humans and the CFIA said there are no health concerns for people using the infected bodies of water or eating infected fish.

Hunt said he expects Johnson Lake will be restocked in a couple of years if the project proves to be successful.

[Whirling disease affects salmonids (i.e. trouts, salmon, grayling, whitefish). The etiologic agent, _Myxobolus cerebralis_, is a myxosporean parasite (Phylum Cnidaria) was introduced to the United States from Europe in the 1950s.

It needs to infect a tubificid oligochaete (_Tubifex tubifex_, a kind of segmented worm) to complete its life-cycle (in fact, _T. tubifex_ is the definitive host of _M. cerebralis_, and fish are intermediary hosts). Infection by the parasite in fish does not always lead to development of the disease or to population losses. However, this can occur under certain circumstances and whirling disease has been associated with major fishery losses and economic costs.

The impact on wild salmonid populations is associated with the lineage of _T. tubifex_ present in the area, as some are more prone to be infected.

Whirling disease cannot infect humans, mammals, or fish that are not members of the salmonid family. - Mod.PMB
