A _Mycobacterium abscessus_ outbreak among lung transplant patients at a single hospital was traced to new building construction and its tainted water supply, researchers reported here.

_M. abscessus_ infections were confirmed in 39 recently hospitalized lung transplant patients, the source of which was traced to 12 tap water supply locations in the ward, prompting the use of sterile water and a new antibiotic prophylaxis regimen, including imipenem and inhaled amikacin, to manage the outbreak, Arthur W Baker, MD, MPH, of Duke University, and colleagues presented at IDWeek.

"A new medical tower that had largely ICU beds and began to serve patients in late 2013...lead to an amplification event where the concentration of _M. abscessus_ grew past a certain threshold, but those isolates were present before the construction and opening of the building," Baker said at IDWeek -- the joint meeting of 4 medical organizations with an interest in infectious illness -- the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the HIV Medicine Association (HIVMA), the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA), and the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS).

"_Mycobacterium abscessus_, and all rapid growing mycobacteria, can be problematic for hospitals, because they're ubiquitous in the environment. They're in the soil, they're in the water supply, and I think it's always a concern when you're building a new building -- potential contamination of the water to patients who could be at risk to acquire infections," Kimberly Hanson, MD, of the University of Utah, who was not affiliated with the study, said in an interview with MedPage Today. "I think it's something hospitals should consider and physicians should be aware of and alert to that new cases of environmental organisms in their compromised host could signal hospital outbreak."

From August 2013 through May 2014, the incidence rate was 3.9 cases per month, but that rate dropped back down to an average of 1.0 case per month after the implementation of intervention in June 2014 through March 2015 (incidence rate ratio 0.26, 95 percent CI [confidence interval] 0.13-0.51, P less than 0.0001).

In 92 percent of the patients, _M. abscessus_ was first isolated in the respiratory tract.

On average, the lung transplant patients were 64, age range 22-75, and the number of days from transplant surgery to date of 1st positive culture was 13 (interquartile range 7-46). In 90 percent of the patients, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was the source of the first positive culture. 4 other sources -- endotracheal aspirate, pleural fluid, abdomen, and blood -- provided the 1st positive culture in one patient each.

During the investigation for the source of the contaminant, the researchers determined that there was no evidence of a pseudo-outbreak in the microbiology lab, or contamination of the bronchoscopes or bronchoscopy suite.

The researchers took cultures from environmental biofilms from 73 water sources in the hospital. These included patient room faucets and showerheads, ward faucets, and ice machines. Out of those 73 source environmental cultures, 12, or 16 percent, grew _M. abscessus_.

In all 12 of the environmental isolates, and 10 of the 13 clinical isolates, a unique genotypic profile -- type VI erm gene and C-to-T mutation at base pair 207 of the rpoB gene was identified.

4 of the 10 clinical isolates, and 8 of the 12 environmental isolates, were indistinguishable by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis.

The implementation of sterile water for all hospital lung transplant patients in June 2014 included eliminating ice and tap water use for oral care, gastric/nasogastric tube flushes, speech therapy evaluation, consumption, and bathing.

And a new antibiotic prophylaxis regimen of imipenem and inhaled amikacin was implemented, which lowered the incidence rate from 4.2 cases per month to 0.9 cases per month (incidence rate ratio, 0.2, 95 percent CI 0.1-0.4, P less than 0.001). Baker said that this was a return to the pre-outbreak incidence rate.

The hospital also made engineering changes to the new medical tower to decrease concentration of _M. abscessus_ at the hospital tap water outlets, Baker said.

Baker said that a limitation to the study was the inability to determine the relative impact of sterile water protocol and perioperative antibiotic changes, as they were introduced simultaneously.

[_Mycobacterium abscessus_ infection in lung transplant recipients is uncommon. In a survey of 31 transplant centers, of 5200 lung transplants recipients, post-transplantation _M. abscessus_ infections occurred in the pulmonary allograft in 12 (0.23 percent), in skin/soft tissue in 3, or both in 2 (Chernenko SM, Humar A, Hutcheon M, et al: _Mycobacterium abscessus_ infections in lung transplant recipients: the international experience. J Heart Lung Transplant. 2006; 25(12): 1447-55; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17178340).

The news report above describes an outbreak of _M. abscessus_ infection in 39 recently hospitalized lung transplant recipients in a 10-month period at a North Carolina hospital, the source of which was traced to tap water supply locations in the ICU, which prompted the use of sterile water and a new antibiotic prophylaxis regimen. However, even having an average of 1.0 case of _M. abscessus_ infection per month in the 10 months after the implementation of intervention in June 2014 through March 2015 seems excessive.

The following has been mostly extracted from my comments in prior ProMED-mail posts below:

_Mycobacterium abscessus_ (formerly _M. chelonae_ subspecies _abscessus_) is an acid-fast bacillus that is part of a grouping separate from _M. tuberculosis_ complex that are known as non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) (http://www.cdc.gov/hai/organisms/mycobacterium.html). NTM differ among themselves on the basis of in vitro growth rate, colonial pigmentation and rapid molecular diagnostics. Non-pigmented, rapidly growing mycobacterial species (RGM) produce mature growth on agar plates within 7 days of incubation and include the _M. fortuitum_ complex and the _M. chelonae-abscessus_ group. The _M. abscessus_ subset includes _M. abscessus_ sensu stricto, _M. massiliense_ and _M. bolletii_. (Pigmented, intermediately growing NTM require 7-10 days to produce mature growth on agar plates and include _M. marinum_ and _M. gordonae_. Slowly growing NTM, which require more than 7-10 days to produce mature growth on agar plates, include _M. kansasii_ and the _M. avium/intracellulare_ complex.)

NTM are environmental mycobacteria, found in water and soil, that can form biofilms on the inner surfaces of drinking water distribution systems, constituting a risk for certain patients both by microaspiration or by inhalation of aerosols. Water from these systems can also contaminate medications and medical instruments. Outbreaks of infections due to RGM are generally related to subcutaneous injection of substances contaminated with the bacterium or through invasive medical procedures employing contaminated equipment or implanted devices. Infection can also occur after accidental injury where the wound is contaminated by soil. In immunocompromised patients, RGM also cause disseminated infection.

_M. abscessus_ in particular is capable of colonizing the respiratory tract and cause serious lung infections in persons with various chronic lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, where it has been a contraindication to lung transplantation (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053249806003263). _M. abscessus_ pulmonary infections can be severe and especially difficult to treat because of the resistance of _M. abscessus_ to many antibiotics. The few drugs that have in vitro activity against _M. abscessus_ include clarithromycin, azithromycin, aminoglycosides, cefoxitin, tigecycline, and imipenem. Recommendations are to combine clarithromycin with at least one other drug, such as an aminoglycoside (usually amikacin) or perhaps one other injectable drug such as cefoxitin or imipenem, depending on results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing (http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/01/30/jac.dkr578.full).

The total duration of therapy usually recommended is 6 to 12 or more months (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/42/12/1756.full). Localized disease typically responds to 6 months of therapy in immunocompetent hosts, and lung or disseminated infections can require over 6 months of therapy. Surgical resection in patients with areas of focal severe bronchiectasis and/or cavitary pulmonary disease, aimed at decreasing the mycobacterial load and removing a reservoir of infection, when combined with multidrug antibiotic therapy, has been reported to result in more prolonged microbiologic responses (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/52/5/565.long). - Mod.ML
