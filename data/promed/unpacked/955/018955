The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship (IDALS) continued to respond to probable cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza in commercial poultry farms last week.

"A week ago, we had 2 sites," said Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Bill Northey during a 30 Apr 2015 conference call with reporters. "Now we have 7 counties and 17 sites impacted as of today [1 May 2015]."

On 27 Apr 2015, IDALS reported 5 probable cases of HPAI in commercial poultry farms in Osceola, O'Brien and Sioux counties. These joined 3 confirmed cases of the disease in Sac, O'Brien and Buena Vista counties announced earlier.

On 29 Apr 2015, IDALS responded to 4 probable cases of HPAI in commercial poultry farms in Buena Vista and Kossuth counties.

On 30 Apr 2015, IDALS responded to 5 additional cases in commercial poultry farms, 3 in Buena Vista County and one each in Sioux and Clay counties.

State officials have quarantined all the premises. The 27 and 29 Apr 2015 cases have been confirmed positive, and all birds on the property will be euthanized to prevent the spread of the disease. If initial tests are confirmed for the 30 Apr 2015 cases, the birds on these properties will be euthanized as well.

These sites were announced on 27 Apr 2015:
Osceola County 2 - Pullet farm with an estimated 250 000 birds.
O'Brien County 1 - Commercial laying operation with an estimated 240 000 birds.
O'Brien County 2 - Commercial laying operation with an estimated 98 000 birds.
Sioux County 1 - Commercial laying operation with an estimated 1.7 million birds.
Sioux County 2 - Commercial laying operation with an estimated 3.8 million birds.

Initial testing showed all 5 sites positive for H5 avian influenza, and additional confirmatory testing from the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames showed the farms are positive.

The sites announced on 29 Apr 2015 were:
Buena Vista 2 - Turkey farm with an estimated 50 000 birds.
Buena Vista 3 - Turkey farm with an estimated 40 000 birds.
Buena Vista 4 - Commercial laying operation with an estimated 63 000 birds.
Kossuth County - Chicken breeder farm with an estimated 19 000 birds.

Initial testing showed all 4 sites positive for H5 avian influenza. Additional confirmatory testing from the APHIS NVSL showed the farms are positive.

These sites were announced 30 Apr 2015:

Buena Vista 5 - Commercial laying operation with an estimated 5.5 million birds that experienced increased mortality.
Buena Vista 6 - Turkey farm that has experienced increased mortality. An estimate on the number of birds at the site is still pending.
Buena Vista 7 - Turkey farm that has experienced increased mortality. An estimate on the number of birds at the site is still pending.
Sioux 3 - Commercial laying operation with an estimated 84 000 birds that has experienced increased mortality.
Clay - Commercial laying operation that has experienced increased mortality. An estimate on the number of birds at the site is still pending.

Initial testing showed all 5 sites positive for H5 avian influenza. Additional confirmatory testing is pending for the 30 Apr 2015 sites from APHIS NVSL in Ames.

Rembrandt Enterprises, one of the nation's largest egg producers, confirmed the Buena Vista 5 operation is its Rembrandt facility, according to the Des Moines Register. The company said its egg-laying facilities in Thompson and Renville, Minnesotta have not been affected.

The Center for Disease Control and Iowa Department of Public Health consider the risk to people from these HPAI H5N2 infections in wild birds, backyard flocks, and commercial poultry to be low, Northey said. No human infections with the virus have ever been detected, and there is no food safety risk for consumers.

"I ate eggs today, and in the coming days, I'll have extra eggs and turkey in solidarity with the industry and the challenges it is going through," Northey said.

He urged all bird owners, whether commercial producers or backyard flock owners, to continue to practice good biosecurity, prevent contact between their birds and wild birds, and report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to state/federal officials, either through their state veterinarian at (515) 281-5321 or through USDA's toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593.

As IDALs receives final confirmation, updated disease information will be posted to the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship's website at http://www.iowaagriculture.gov/avianinfluenza.asp.

Last week, U.S. Senate and House Agriculture Committee leadership called for emergency assistance to be released to poultry and egg producers whose flocks suffered losses due to HPAI H5N2 infections.

Agriculture Committee Chairmen Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., and Rep. K. Michael Conaway, R-Texas, and ranking members Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., and Rep. Collin Peterson, D-Minn. sent a letter to the Office of Management and Budget emphasizing the urgency in which the Secretary of Agriculture be approved to utilize his emergency Commodity Credit Corporation transfer authority to help mitigate the spread of HPAI and limit the economic damages it causes to poultry farmers whose flocks become infected with the disease.

"We urge you to ensure that your agency takes all necessary steps to guarantee that it not impede USDA's immediate response to this emergency," the letter stated.

The letter said that the virus has affected nearly 100 farms in over a dozen states requiring the depopulation of approximately 8 million birds in agriculture production across the country.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced on 29 Apr 2015 that it is awaiting test results to determine the cause of deaths for American coots and lesser scaup collected 2 weeks ago from Pools 9 and 10 of the Mississippi River. The waterfowl are being tested at the National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin. Officials do not suspect avian influenza.

The United States Department of Agriculture confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza in 8 additional turkey flocks on Wed 29 Apr 2015. It also announced that 3 presumptive positive flocks were also detected.

The presumptive positive flocks include 2 in Kandiyohi and one in Meeker County. If confirmed, this would bring the number of affected flocks in Kandiyohi to 25 and to 7 in Meeker County. The presumptive positive in Meeker County is a flock of 72 400 turkeys. At this point there are 67 farms in 19 counties known to be affected in Minnesota.

The virus was 1st confirmed in Pope County on 5 Mar 2015. The affected farm has now completed the composting of the birds and is working on cleaning and disinfecting the barns, the Minnesota Board of Animal Health reported.

It also noted that the Minnesota National Guard has completed its water delivery mission. A sufficient force of private contractors is in place to provide water for the foaming operations used to euthanize birds on affected farms.

The bird flu virus that has been spreading across Midwest turkey and poultry farms was confirmed to have been found at a large egg-laying facility in Jefferson County last Wednesday.

The latest outbreak of the highly pathogenic H5N2 strain has been identified at one of Daybreak Foods Inc.'s egg-laying facilities in the county that houses 800 000 hens. All of the remaining birds will be killed to prevent any spread of the disease.

Authorities have stressed there has been no risk to public health and no danger to the food supply from the avian flu outbreak because the sick birds show signs and die quickly.

The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection spokeswoman Raechelle Cline says initial tests show it's an H5 virus, but results are still pending to confirm whether it's the same H5N2 virus that has struck commercial poultry farms across the Midwest.

Earlier last Wednesday, the agency reported an H5 infection in a flock of 87 000 turkeys in Chippewa County. Hormel Foods Corp. confirms that that facility is owned by its Jennie-O Turkey Store division.

All birds in the 2 flocks -- the 4th and 5th cases in the state -- that haven't died from the flu will be killed. The latest discovery raises the number of Wisconsin cases to 5.

Reports indicate that the Daybreak Foods flock is the 2nd largest chicken flock to be infected since the outbreak started in late 2014. The largest is an Iowa farm with 5.3 million egg-laying hens.

"This is a catastrophe for both the turkey and the egg industries," Daybreak Foods Inc. President William Rehm told Bloomberg Business on Wednesday [29 Apr 2015] after his company's farm in Jefferson County was infected by bird flu. "Some U.S. Department of Agriculture veterinarians are starting to believe the virus is spreading from particulates in the air."

Officials are investigating how the virus entered the flock and might not have answers for some time. Daybreak Foods, based in Lake Mills, reportedly found evidence of the virus on Tuesday [28 Apr 2015] during routine inspections, and the USDA confirmed avian influenza, Rehm told Bloomberg.

"We have put up the best biosecurity parameters to defend our facilities against the disease," Rehm said.

The company has facilities with 13.5 million hens in Iowa, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin, which includes another operation -- Creekwood Farms -- in Jefferson County.

The avian influenza virus found in the flocks likely is the highly contagious H5N2 strain. The virus' 1st appearance in Wisconsin was in a commercial chicken egg-laying facility in Jefferson County on 12 Apr 2015, the 1st time the virus was found in a chicken flock in a 7-state outbreak affecting Midwestern states.

A total of 200 000 chickens are in the process either of having died from the disease or being disposed of. Cline explained that the 1st site has not been identified as a matter of disease management and containment.

"It is not a matter of not wanting to tell people what's going on," she said. "If people go out there and take it (virus) home, we've got a bigger problem, and we just don't want that to happen."

Sites within the quarantine zone are not permitted to have poultry or poultry products moving off site. Cline said that in some cases, a site could be granted a special permit. She was not aware of any such situation at this time in Jefferson County.

Multiple outbreaks of avian influenza have occurred most recently in Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Arkansas, the Dakotas, and Kansas, leading to the depopulation of more than one million turkeys and chickens since January 2015.

The H5 avian influenza virus was 1st detected in Wisconsin at a commercial chicken flock in Jefferson County on Mon 13 Apr 2015, which led to the depopulation of more than 200 000 egg-laying chickens, which still is ongoing.

"Resources were already spread thin with all of the detections spread throughout the Midwest," Cline said. "The more cases we have, the more it puts a strain on the resources we have."

Since the original Wisconsin outbreak, 3 additional flocks were detected in Barron, Juneau and Chippewa counties, bringing the total of birds destroyed to nearly 400 000 in Wisconsin.

The flu also was found in a turkey farm of 126 000 turkeys in Barron County and a small, mixed-bird backyard flock of 40 mixed breed birds in Juneau County.

"We have actually been successful in depopulating the Barron and Juneau county flocks," Cline said. "Now we will be moving the Barron County crew and equipment to the Chippewa County site."

Cline anticipates depopulation is expected to go quickly once the process is started. "You just never know, things are very fluid when dealing with situations like this," she said. Cline noted that the Daybreak site was within the surveillance zone of the original Jefferson County site that had the disease.

For any outbreak, facilities or locations with any poultry on their premises within a 6.2-mile radius are notified and have their birds undergo testing procedures.

Prior to the findings at the Daybreak Foods site, all other birds within the surveillance zone around the original Jefferson County outbreak almost had been completed. "All of the birds had been tested on the surrounding properties," Cline said.

To expedite the additional testing process, those sites already tested during the initial outbreak will be excluded. However, she said the newly identified quarantine area likely will not be tested until next week.

"Usually, the 1st sign of this virus is sudden death and a higher mortality without any clinical signs of illness at all," Cline said.

Dr. Paul McGraw, Wisconsin state veterinarian, already issued a ban on poultry movement to shows, exhibitions and swap meets in Jefferson, Juneau and Barron counties. Chippewa County was added to the ban on Wednesday [29 Apr 2015] morning. Per the order, the ban extends through 31 May 2015.

Jefferson County Fair Park officials are encouraging all poultry exhibitors to continue signing up for the Jefferson County Fair. Although currently the fairgrounds are under quarantine from having any poultry on site due to proximity to the original outbreak, no indication has been given that the poultry show would not be permitted to go on at the fair in July 2015.

"Bird flu should not be taken lightly, and its containment is vital to the health of our communities and our agricultural economy," U.S. Rep. Ron Kind said. "We need a multi-agency collaborative approach to eradicating this disease, and that's why I'm in close contact with the USDA, Wisconsin DATCP and local authorities to monitor the response and to ensure the necessary measures are being taken. I encourage everyone to avoid contact with sick or dead poultry or wildlife and to report any sick birds to state and federal officials."

Meanwhile, Cline reminded all state residents that the avian influenza virus strain currently detected in Wisconsin and the other states presents low risk to public health. Poultry meat and egg products in the marketplace remain safe to eat. As always, both wild and domestic poultry should be cooked properly.

Backyard poultry owners and other poultry producers are encouraged to practice good biosecurity, and to take steps that prevent contact between their birds and wild birds. Owners are encouraged to monitor their flocks closely and report sick or dead birds to DATCP at 1-800-572-8981.

As the USDA confirmed the infection in 3 more Iowa facilities, the total number of Iowa birds affected by avian flu was fast approaching 10 million.

The 1st infected flock was at a commercial turkey farm in Buena Vista County. Then, more than 5 million hens were to be euthanized after bird flu was found at a commercial egg-laying facility in Osceola County. The facility was quarantined, and the birds had to be euthanized to prevent the spread of H5N2 avian influenza.

Days later, state authorities were testing 4 more probable cases of bird flu at commercial poultry farms in Osceola, O'Brien and Sioux counties. The USDA confirmed those cases, bringing the total to 8 commercial farms with a total of 9 816 900 birds infected with H5N2 avian influenza.

Iowa appears to be hardest hit, with a total of 15 453 273 birds affected in 13 states as of 30 Apr 2015, according to the USDA.

Iowa legislators joined together to send a letter to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack asking for timely updates on the spread and impact of bird flu, including the affect it will have on commercial flocks as well as poultry and egg consumers.

"Since December 2014, the United States Department of Agriculture has confirmed several cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5 in the Pacific, Central, and Mississippi flyways (or migratory bird paths). The disease has been found in wild birds as well as in a few backyard and commercial poultry flocks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers the risk to people from these HPAI H5 infections to be low. No human cases of these HPAI H5 viruses have been detected in the United States, Canada, or internationally," the USDA statement said.

Report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to the USDA by calling 1-866-536-7593.93.

[Iowa is indeed hard hit. It is probably the largest egg producer in the country, producing one in every 5 eggs consumed across the country, or roughly 20 percent of all eggs.

Most of these states have declared emergency status and are seeing both state and federal assistance in quelling outbreaks, disposing of terminated birds and eliminating potentially contaminated litter. This is no small or inexpensive task for Iowa or any of the other affected states.
