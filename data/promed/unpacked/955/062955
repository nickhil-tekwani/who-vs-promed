Marburg virus has been detected in Egyptian rousette bats (_Rousettus aegyptiacus_) in Sierra Leone. This is the 1st time that evidence of active Marburg virus infection has been found in West Africa, and was made before the detection of any known Marburg virus disease illnesses or deaths in people. This fruit-eating bat species is found throughout much of Africa and prefers to roost in subterranean caves and mines.

These findings were jointly reported to the Government of Sierra Leone by 2 independent research teams, one led by Njala University with support from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Viral Special Pathogens Branch, and the USAID-PREDICT project led by the University of California, Davis and the University of Makeni.

To date [21 Dec 2018], 5 Marburg virus-positive Egyptian rousette bats have been detected. These bats were sampled by the 2 teams near caves in 3 different locations including Moyamba, Koinadugu, and Kono districts. These bats are the known reservoir of Marburg virus in east and central Africa with virus detected in bats in Uganda, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Kenya, and South Africa.

The government of Sierra Leone and international partners are engaging district and local communities to convey what is known about Marburg virus, and how to live safely with bats, especially in and around caves and mines. Engagement with local communities has occurred throughout these projects from their initial phases. Meetings with communities to share plans and answer questions about Marburg virus and especially how to reduce the risk of exposure to the Marburg virus and other zoonotic pathogens are ongoing.

The discovery of Marburg virus in West Africa nearly 2700 km [1678 miles] west of the previously recognized endemic area and prior to any known human cases demonstrates the impact of proactive One Health-based approaches to disease surveillance to discover potential health threats before they spill over from animals to people and initiate disease outbreaks.

A joint scientific publication among the discovery partners is in preparation, but in light of the high-consequence and highly transmissible nature of Marburg virus infection in people, it was determined that rapid public notification was essential.

People should not attempt to kill or eradicate bats in response to this discovery. While bats have been implicated as reservoirs for a number of infectious pathogens, they play important roles as providers of ecosystem services through pollination of native and agricultural crops, reduction of insect pests that also spread disease and damage crops, and consumption of mosquitoes and other pests that feed on people and livestock. Killing or disturbing bats in their natural habitat could actually increase the risk of transmission of Marburg virus, as has been seen in Uganda previously (Amman et al. Emerg Infect Dis 2014;20(10):1761-4) and with rabies virus throughout the world.

Marburg virus was co-discovered in Sierra Leone by the Njala University (https:njala.edu.sl) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<www.cdc.gov>) and the UC [University of California] Davis (http://www.onehealthinstitute.net) and the University of Makeni (http://unimak.edu.sl/wordpress), as part of the PREDICT-USAID-funded project (http://www.predict.global).

[As mentioned previously, detection of the virus in these bats in Sierra Leone, west Africa, serves as a warning not only in that country and in Uganda, but in other countries where this bat is found. Health care providers need to be aware of this when attending patients with hemorrhagic fevers.

Uganda has reported the majority of Marburg virus infections in bats and in humans. There have been sporadic cases of Marburg virus disease in Uganda in the past.

The virus undoubtedly remains endemic in bats in Sierra Leone as well as in Uganda, and one hopes that public education will result in less human contact with bats there.
