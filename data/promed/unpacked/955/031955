Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, Russian Federation (update)
---------------------------------------------------------
On 26 July [1999, the Ministry of Health reported that Crimean-
Congo haemorrhagic fever had been confirmed by laboratory
tests. A total of 65 cases has been reported, with 6 deaths (3 of
which were among children). Of those admitted to hospital, 44 have
been discharged and 21 are still undergoing treatment.
There have been no new cases since 22 July [1999, and the
epidemic is localized.
Transmission appears to have occurred mainly through reservoirs
in the environment (ticks).

[This official report does not say how many of the cases were lab
confirmed. The WHO report dated 22 Jul 1999 (ref. 03 above)
said: "On 1 July 1999, WHO was notified that the Ivanovsky
Institute of Virology had confirmed 4 cases of Crimean-Congo
haemorrhagic fever (see the WHO fact sheet on CCHF)."
This new report does not say if any more than those 4 have been
confirmed, & does not clarify whether there is adequate "clinical or
epidemiological information to support a link" with the "32 similar
cases in the Volgograd city area" (same ref.) -- Mod.JW
