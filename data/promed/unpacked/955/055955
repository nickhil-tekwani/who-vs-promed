State health officials document increase in tularemia
--------------------------------------------------
Massachusetts public health officials have confirmed 8 cases of tularemia
on the island of Martha's Vineyard in 2005, the highest number since 2000,
when 15 people were diagnosed. The report raises the number of confirmed
tularemia cases to 37 since the summer of 2000 and marks the 6th successive
summer that the rare disease has been documented on the Island.
Dr. Frederic Cantor, the public health veterinarian for the state
department of public health (DPH), said 3 of the 8 cases have been
confirmed as pneumonic tularemia, a form of the disease that affects the
respiratory tract and is caused by inhaling airborne tularemia bacteria.
While rare in other parts of the nation, pneumonic tularemia has been
documented in increasing numbers on the Vineyard in recent years. Health
officials continue to urge people who work outdoors to wear respirators
rated at N-95 or higher to filter out potentially harmful particles. Dr.
Cantor said none of the 3 victims of pneumonic tularemia appeared to have
been wearing masks when they were infected.
"Most of these again seem to have exposure to outdoor activities in terms
of landscaping, caretaking and gardening. I think part of the issue is, are
all these people not wearing masks and why?" he said. "That seems to be a
risk factor and most of the people seem not to be wearing masks."
Dr. Cantor said the DPH is examining a possible 4 additional cases of
tularemia. At least 2 of this year's confirmed cases were other types of
tularemia, which can be spread by handling infected material, such as
animal carcasses or by bites from dog ticks, known to carry the disease. 3
of the 8 cases are still unclassified, Dr. Cantor said. One has been
confirmed as tickborne, and the 1st case of the year, contracted in Apr
2005 by a Vineyard landscaper, was oropharyngeal, indicating that the
affected glands were in the man's throat. While the pneumonic form of
tularemia is the most common type seen on the Island, Dr. Cantor said the
other cases in 2005 point to the fact that the disease can be spread a
variety of ways.
Tularemia has been documented on the Island since the 1930s, when some
hunters began contracting the disease, also sometimes known as rabbit fever
because rabbits primarily carry the disease. The 1st major outbreak of
pneumonic tularemia occurred in 1978, when 15 people were infected, 7 of
them from one home in Chilmark. A Chilmark man died in the summer of 2000
after contracting the disease.
Tularemia usually affects about 200 people a year nationwide, putting the
Island at the foreground for study in the medical community. Since the 1st
outbreak in 1978, the high number of tularemia cases has baffled public
health officials and fueled numerous studies. Researchers first traveled to
the Island after the 2000 outbreak, including investigators from the
Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the DPH, and Harvard and Tufts
universities. The teams concluded that landscapers were most at risk, but
so far they have been unable to conclusively locate areas where the risk
for tularemia is the greatest.
"There is work that's still being done on the Island," Dr. Cantor said,
"There may be areas that are likely hot spots but we can't really ascertain
that."
Sam Telford, an associate professor of infectious diseases at Tufts
University, has been coming to the Island since 2000 once a month during
the spring and summer to collect dog ticks and examine the wild animal
population as part of a tularemia study. Mr. Telford told the Gazette in
Jun 2005 that the number of infected dog ticks has remained the same in the
last 2 years. Mr. Telford's study shows that Squibnocket and Katama have
higher rates of infected ticks than other parts of the Island.

[Human infection with _Francisella tularensis_ continues to be a problem on
Martha's Vineyard, a 100-square-mile island off the southern coast of Cape
Cod, MA. A significant number of the cases are pneumonic, occurring in
landscapers and gardeners, related to the aerosolization of infective
bacteria.
Telford (mentioned in the posting) and colleagues (1) have investigated the
genetic diversity of _F. tularensis_ obtained from Martha's Vineyard
ticks. Between 2001 and 2003, 0.7 percent of 4246 dog ticks (_Dermacentor
variabilis_) harbored the tularemia bacillus, and there was a degree of
genotypic diversity suggestive of long-standing enzootic transmission of
the infection on the island.
The authors review information regarding the island's tularemia, which
appears to have been a relatively recent introduction into
Massachusetts. They state that prior to 1937, only one case of the
infection was recognized, related to contaminated rabbit meat from the
midwestern USA. In 1937, however, more than 20 000 cottontail rabbits from
the midwestern states of Missouri and Kansas were introduced into the
mainland state and Martha's Vineyard for sporting purposes (2). Cases
began to occur starting several years later.
