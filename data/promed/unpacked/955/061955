As many as 36 new patients complaining fever were reported in Sikrauli village of Kakori area in the state capital [Lucknow] on Wednesday [6 Nov 2013]. With this, the total number of people in grip of a fever touched 236. Health officials now say that the cause of trouble is simple viral fever. Chief medical officer [CMO], Lucknow, Dr SNS Yadav said possibility of typhoid or any other vector-borne disease has been ruled out. "Lab reports have confirmed viral fever," he said.

The fever outbreak caught the attention of health officials on Sunday evening [3 Nov 2013] when they received a [text message] stating that more than 50 per cent of the 10 000 residents of Sikrauli village were in the grip of a mystery fever. The message sent alarm bells ringing and a health team was rushed to the village to take stock of the situation. The team comprising CMO and additional CMO (vector-borne diseases control) camped in the village.

[This report adds little to the initial report of 6 Nov 2013 (ProMED-mail archive no 20131107.2043745), except that typhoid and vector-borne pathogens have been eliminated by laboratory tests. That would exclude chikungunya or dengue virus infections, but many other possibilities remain. The number of individuals affected is unclear. This and the previous report stated that half of the 10 000 village residents were infected, but the report above also indicates that the total number is 236. ProMED remains interested in receiving additional information about test results and new cases as this information becomes available.
