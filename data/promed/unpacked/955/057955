[2] Canada - imported cases among travellers
Date: 7 Jul 2015
From: Michael Drebot <Mike.Drebot@phac-aspc.gc.ca> [edited]


Imported chikungunya cases among Canadian travellers, 2014 and 2015
-----------------------------------------
For the year 2014, a total of 429 confirmed cases of imported chikungunya disease have been documented among returning Canadian travellers. As of 1 Jul 2015, an additional 91 confirmed and over 100 probable imported cases have been detected.

Confirmed cases were documented based on reactivity on a CDC based in-house IgM ELISA and positive viral neutralization titres and/or presence of viral RNA in clinical samples. Probable cases are designated as IgM ELISA positives.

Approximately 4000 suspect case samples were submitted to the National Microbiology Laboratory for testing in 2014 and 2015. This is a sharp increase compared with past years, in which total submissions averaged 200 samples per year. From 2008 to 2013, the average number of imported cases identified among Canadians totalled 10-15 cases per year. This is a highly significant increase in yearly totals for Canadians infected by the virus and not surprisingly corresponds to the ongoing outbreak in the Americas. The majority of Canadian provinces have documented at least one imported case of chikungunya with most of the cases involving travellers from the provinces of Ontario (57 per cent) and Quebec (30 per cent).

Although travel histories were only available for 1/3rd of the patients identified in 2014, the vast majority of individuals (93 per cent) with documented travel information did travel to the Americas, particularly the Caribbean. Countries in the Americas in which Canadian travellers were presumably exposed to the virus include: Aruba, Barbados, Colombia, Dominica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Martinique, Puerto Rico, St Lucia, St Martin, Trinidad and Venezuela. Caribbean countries also made up the majority of the travel histories for cases identified early in 2015 (January to March). However, during the past several months, an increasing portion of cases have involved travel to Central and South America and included countries not listed above, such as Panama, Nicaragua, Ecuador, and Brazil. Most of the cases involving travel outside the Americas were identified among Canadians who had visited countries in Asia (5 per cent); however, imported cases involving Africa and the Pacific-Oceania regions were also documented.

Currently, the proportion of laboratory-identified cases among patients clinically suspected of chikungunya disease has dropped from almost 20 per cent in late 2014 and early 2015 to less than 10 per cent in the past several months (March-June 2015). These data reflect trends currently observed in the Caribbean where outbreak activity has decreased. However, imported cases continue to be recognized among Canadians travelling to endemic areas where the virus is circulating, and preventative measures should still be emphasized to avoid exposure.

Of interest, 26 per cent (112/429) of the cases identified in 2014 were found to be viremic using PCR-based diagnostic procedures. At this time, the probability of local transmission is very low due to the absence in Canada of the primary mosquito vectors that transmit the virus (_Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_). However, the expansion of _A. albopictus_ to southern regions of Canada is a possibility in the future if factors such as climate change contribute to its establishment.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Drebot and colleagues for this submission. It provides a comprehensive overview of the imported chikungunya fever cases in 2014 and so far in 2015. Of particular interest is the substantial proportion (26 per cent) of their patients sampled who were viremic. This illustrates again the relative ease with which CHIK virus can be transported over long distances. Should viremic individuals land in a locality with significant populations of vector mosquitoes (unlike Canada), there is real risk of initiation of ongoing transmission.

--------------------------------------
Abstract
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquitoborne arthralgic alphavirus that has garnered international attention as an important emerging pathogen since 2005. More recently, it invaded the Caribbean islands and the Western Hemisphere. Intriguingly, the current CHIKV outbreak in the Caribbean is caused by the Asian CHIKV genotype, which differs from the La Reunion LR2006 OPY1 isolate belonging to the Indian Ocean lineage. Here, we adopted a systematic and comparative approach against LR2006 OPY1 to characterize the pathogenicity of the Caribbean CNR20235 isolate and consequential host immune responses in mice. Ex vivo infection using primary mouse tail fibroblasts revealed a weaker replication efficiency by CNR20235 isolate. In the CHIKV mouse model, CNR20235 infection induced an enervated joint pathology characterized by moderate edema and swelling, independent of mononuclear cell infiltration. Based on systemic cytokine analysis, localized immunophenotyping, and gene expression profiles in the popliteal lymph node and inflamed joints, 2 pathogenic phases were defined for CHIKV infection: early acute (2 to 3 days postinfection [dpi]) and late acute (6 to 8 dpi). Reduced joint pathology during early acute phase of CNR20235 infection was associated with a weaker proinflammatory Th1 response and natural killer (NK) cell activity. The pathological role of NK cells was further demonstrated as depletion of NK cells reduced joint pathology in LR2006 OPY1. Taken together, this study provides evidence that the Caribbean CNR20235 isolate has an enfeebled replication and induces a less pathogenic response in the mammalian host.

[The differences in virus replication and the induced immunoresponsiveness from infection between the La Reunion and Caribbean CHIKV isolates is of interest. Assuming that these isolates behave as similarly as the virus populations in each of these localities from which they came, it would be of interest to compare clinical disease resulting from each to see whether disease on La Reunion was more severe than that occurring in the Caribbean outbreak. - Mod.TY]

[4] Two types of persistence
Date: Thu 2 Jul 2015

On the basis of our clinical experience, 2 types of persistent post-chikungunya fever rheumatic disorders can be distinguished. Approximately 95 per cent of patients who still have pain beyond 3 months after acute infection have varied musculoskeletal features but not polyarthritis and have substantial improvement with prolonged administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (strictly limiting the use of glucocorticoids), analgesics, and local treatment, including physiotherapy. In contrast, the conditions of the other 5 per cent of patients meet the criteria for chronic inflammatory rheumatism (rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, or unclassified polyarthritis), with a potentially destructive course, and require disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (such as methotrexate), as recommended by rheumatologists. These 2 distinct post-chikungunya fever profiles need to be distinguished in the assessment of therapeutic trials or biomedical studies, because the underlying immune and viral mechanisms (including antigen clearance and replicative sanctuaries) are likely to differ between them. An understanding of post-chikungunya fever pathogenesis is essential to improve therapeutic strategies for millions of affected patients worldwide.
