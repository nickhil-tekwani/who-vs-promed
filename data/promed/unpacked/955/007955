I would like to inform you that we now carry updated measles situation in
Japan on our website in English. It will be updated regularly.

[The updated information as of week 21 (from 21 to 27 May 2007) from the
above link is presented below - Mod.MPP]
Infectious Disease Surveillance Center, National Institute of Infectious
Diseases, Tokyo, Japan
---------------------
Sentinel Surveillance:
Between 1 [Jan 2007] and 27 May 2007, a total of 1121 measles cases from
3000 pediatric sentinels have been reported nationwide. 657 cases of them
(59 per cent) were reported from southern Kanto area including Saitama,
Tokyo and Chiba. Age distribution is characteristic; fewer cases are seen
among 0 to 4 years old (N=426, 38 per cent) than in average year (55 to 67
per cent) and more cases are reported from 10 to 14 years old (N=358, 32
per cent) than in average year (5 to 15 per cent).
In 21st epidemiological week (from 21 to 27 May [2007]), 215 new cases from
pediatric sentinels have been reported from 27 prefectures in Japan; 108
cases from southern Kanto area, 35 cases from northern part of Japan
including Miyagi and Hokkaido. This was the highest number of cases
reported per week in 2007.
Regarding adult measles (cases of 15 year old and older), between 1 [Jan
2007] and 27 May 2007, a total of 387 cases have been reported from 450
hospital sentinels; 139 cases from Tokyo, 45 cases from Kanagawa, 40 cases
from Miyagi and 34 cases from Saitama. The numbers of reported adult cases
were also highest since the surveillance system started in 1999. Cases
reported from southern Kanto area are increasing continuously. This report
also indicates that the outbreak is spreading to the northern part of Japan.
From the result of hospital sentinels, 33 per cent (N=129) of cases are
among 20 to 24 year old, 23 per cent (N=90) are among 25 to 29 year old,
and 21 per cent (N=83) are among 15 to 19 year old. Roughly 91 per cent
(N=352) of them were reported from the group under 35 years old.
School closure:
According to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, between 1 [Apr
2007] and 26 May 2007, a total of 103 schools were closed completely (78)
or partially (25) due to measles outbreak. 64 of them were high schools
(33) or colleges/ universities (31). About 70 per cent of them were
reported from Kanto area including Tokyo.
Severity of the epidemic:
A total of 3 cases of encephalitis related to measles have been reported in
2007; one in the teens and the others in the twenties.
Virus isolated:
According to the local public health laboratories, all of the sequenced
measles viruses (N=21) have been identified as D5 strain.
Public health measures:
* Information regarding the recent situation of measles epidemic has been
rapidly provided to the public.
* Public sensitization has been conducted regarding the importance of the
vaccination, especially to the people who are at highest risk (those who
have had neither measles infection nor vaccination in the past). Routine
vaccination, especially the 1st dose, was enhanced.
* As of 16 May 2007, 37 out of 131 local governments nationwide reported
that they have started notifiable surveillance system for measles cases.
* 500 000 doses of measles-containing vaccine and 600 000 diagnostic kits
will additionally be supplied to health care facilities and diagnostic
laboratories by the end of June 2007.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr Nobuhiko Okabe for sending on the links
to official information on the status of the measles outbreak in Japan, and
to commend the Japanese government for their efforts in making this
information available in English for wider access to this official
epidemiologic information.
From the above information it seems clear that the population of
susceptibles are among the older individuals who either missed getting any
measles containing vaccine during the routine childhood immunization
activities, or are those who may have had one dose of measles vaccine at
the recommended early childhood age, but have not had a 2nd follow-up dose
as now recommended in the routine immunization schedule in Japan. A similar
challenge that many other countries have faced once the vaccination
coverages of the childhood populations have increased.
According to the above data, during the period 1 Jan 2007 through 27 May
2007, there were a total of 1508 cases of measles reported through 2
sentinel reporting systems (pediatric sentinels and adult hospital
sentinels). Of these, 1121 were less than 15 years of age (74 per cent).
Overall, 426 (28 per cent) were in the less than 5 year old population, the
group that was most often involved in measles outbreaks in the pre-vaccine
era. Of note is that overall, 387 cases (26 per cent) were in the over 15
year old population, a group that does not routinely present to the health
sector for "childhood" vaccinations. The observation that 91 percent of the
adult cases (defined as over 15 years of age) were in those less than 35
years of age, suggests that the susceptible population in Japan includes
those individuals born later than 1972. (the musings of a former EPI --
Expanded Programme on Immunizations -- epidemiologist who enjoys the
occasional number crunching).
The D5 strain of measles virus had been endemic in Japan in the past.
According to Riddell MA and colleagues (Review of the temporal and
geographical distribution of measles virus genotypes in the prevaccine and
postvaccine eras. Virology Journal 2005; 2: 87, available at
<http://www.virologyj.com/content/pdf/1743-422X-2-87.pdf>) "Genotype D5 is
endemic in Cambodia and has been associated with measles cases detected in
the Americas, the UK, Germany and Australia. Epidemiological investigations
have identified Japan and Thailand as the main sources for these
importations. Until recently both genotype D3, and genotype D5 were endemic
in Japan [refs 26,29-31 found in bibliography of paper page 8]. However,
recent evidence suggests that these genotypes may no longer be predominant
in Japan [ref 32 - found in bibliography of paper page 8]."
Of note in the above summary is the spread of the measles activity to
northern parts of the country, with Hokkaido being the most northerly of
the prefectures in Japan. Because there has been significant circulation of
measles virus in schools (including universities), as the summer season
approaches and school vacations begin, the risk of further geographic
expansion (both within Japan as well as internationally) related to
travelling infected students exists (as seen by the recent imported cases
among a school group travelling to Canada).
