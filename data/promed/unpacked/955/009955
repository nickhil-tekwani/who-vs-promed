The Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed one imported case of monkeypox infection in Singapore, involving a Nigerian national who arrived last month [April 2019] for a workshop. The 38-year-old man tested positive for the rare viral disease, which is primarily transmitted to humans from animals, on Wednesday (8 May [2019]), said the MOH on Thursday [9 May 2019]. It is the 1st case of monkeypox reported here.

He is currently in an isolation ward at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), and is in stable condition.

Meanwhile, 22 of 23 individuals who have been identified as close contacts of the patient are also under quarantine as a precautionary measure. One of the close contacts, a workshop participant, had left Singapore on 5 May [2019] before the patient was diagnosed. He has reported to the MOH that he remains well with no symptoms.

"Nonetheless, as a precaution, MOH has informed the public health authority in his home country," said the ministry. The MOH added that while it is possible for the disease to be transmitted between humans, the risk of spread is low.

The MOH offers the following precautions to take when travelling to areas affected by monkeypox in central and western Africa:
- Maintain a high standard of personal hygiene, including frequent hand washing after going to the toilet, or when hands are soiled.
- Avoid direct contact with skin lesions of infected living or dead persons or animals, as well as objects that may have become contaminated with infectious fluids, such as soiled clothing or linens (e.g., bedding or towels) used by an infected person.
- Avoid contact with wild animals, and consumption of bush meat.
- Returning travellers from areas affected by monkeypox should seek immediate medical attention if they develop any disease symptoms (e.g., sudden onset of high fever, swollen lymph nodes and rash) within 3 weeks of their return. They should inform their doctor of their recent travel history.

Before coming to Singapore, the man attended a wedding in Nigeria, where he may have consumed bush meat -- a possible source of transmission of the monkeypox virus. Bush meat, the meat of wild animals hunted and sold for food, is a popular source of protein in some parts of Africa where meat from domesticated animals is scarce or expensive.

Upon his arrival on 28 Apr [2019], he stayed at Hotel 81 Orchid in Geylang. In the following 2 days, he attended a workshop at the Samsung Hub in Church Street, in the Central Business District.

On 30 Apr [2019], he developed fever, muscle ache, chills and skin rash. Between 1 and 7 May [2019], the man reported that he stayed in his hotel room most of the time. On 7 May [2019], he was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital by ambulance and referred to NCID.

Subsequently, the MOH identified the people who had come into close contact with the man, including 18 participants and trainers who attended the same workshop; one worker at the workshop venue; and 4 hotel staff. They have since been assessed by NCID and offered vaccination to prevent the disease or reduce the severity of symptoms, said the ministry.

"As a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined and monitored for 21 days from their date of exposure to the patient," said MOH. Those who develop symptoms will be treated at NCID, and all others who came into contact with the man and have a low risk of being infected are being put under active surveillance, and will be contacted twice daily to monitor their health status, the ministry added. MOH's investigation and contact tracing operations are ongoing.

Common symptoms of the disease are fever, headache, muscle ache, backache, swollen lymph nodes and skin rash. In its statement, the MOH said monkeypox is usually self-limiting, with most patients recovering within 2 to 3 weeks.

"In some cases, however, the virus can cause serious complications such as pneumonia, sepsis, encephalitis (brain inflammation) and eye infection with ensuing loss of vision," added the statement. "There have been reported mortality rates of 1% to 10% during outbreaks, with most deaths occurring in younger age-groups."

Transmission of monkeypox mainly occurs when a person comes into close contact with infected animals, usually rodents, through the hunting and consumption of bush meat. It added that transmission of the disease between humans is possible but limited, as a person is infectious only when he has symptoms, particularly skin rash.

"Transmission typically occurs from close contact with the respiratory tract secretions or skin lesions of an infected person, or objects recently contaminated by an infected person's fluids or lesion materials," it added.

[This is not the 1st time that a human monkeypox (MPX) virus infection has been imported into another country from Nigeria. In 2018, 2 cases of MPX virus infection were imported into the UK with an additional case ensuing from local transmission from the 2nd patient. The 1st monkeypox case involved a male Nigerian naval officer who was attending a training course at a naval base in Cornwall in southwestern England. The 2nd patient was a UK man who returned to the country from a 22-day vacation in Nigeria on 4 Sep 2018. A 3rd imported case was an Israeli who lived and worked in the Port Harcourt area of Rivers state in southern Nigeria (an endemic MPX region). The man got sick about a week after his return to Israel from Nigeria.

MPX virus is endemic in Nigeria and has been actively transmitted this year (2019). Since the beginning of the outbreak in September 2017, 311 suspected cases and 7 deaths have been reported in 26 states in Nigeria. MPX virus transmission is currently occurring over a broad geographic area in Nigeria. This outbreak has been unusual. Rather than sporadic or rare cases, there have been over 100 cases scattered over a large geographic area since 2017 and again this year (2019). The reasons for this relatively sudden appearance are not clear. Perhaps there has been an epizootic of MPX virus infections among its rodent hosts, with spillover to people.

Monkeypox is an orthopoxvirus infection and is related to smallpox. The disease can also be confused with chickenpox, which is caused by an unrelated virus.

Non-human primates are not monkeypox virus reservoirs. The main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp., an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents (genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_).
