Influenza activity declining in the WHO European Region
-------------------------------------------------------

Summary
-------
- This issue is based on data reported in week 11/2011 [14-20 Mar
2011] by 46 [of the 53] Member States in the WHO European Region.
- Influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory infection (ARI)
activity has passed recent peaks in 38 countries of the Region.
- Sentinel hospitalizations for severe acute respiratory infections
(SARI) are generally declining, but remain above pre-season levels in
some countries.
- 33 percent of sentinel specimens from patients with ILI and/or ARI,
and 40 percent of specimens from sentinel SARI patients tested
positive for influenza.
- Pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 and influenza B continue to
co-circulate in the Region.

Current situation -- week 11/2011 [14-20 Mar 2011]
--------------------------------------------------
During week 11/2011 [14-20 Mar 2011], 23 countries reported a low
intensity of influenza and 17 countries reported medium intensity.
Among 40 countries reporting on the geographical spread of influenza,
a majority reported either sporadic (20) or local (9) activity, while
10 reported either regional or widespread activity and one country
reported no activity. The impact of influenza on health care systems
was low in 21 and moderate in 4 of the 25 countries reporting on this
indicator.

Clinical data also suggest decreasing influenza activity in much of
the WHO European Region. Of the 39 countries reporting on consultation
rates for ILI and/or ARI, 21 countries reported decreases and 38 have
passed apparent peaks in ILI or ARI clinical activity.

Data from sentinel hospital-based surveillance for SARI were received
from 10 countries (Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Malta,
the Republic of Moldova, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, and
Ukraine). During week 11/2011 [14-20 Mar 2011], sentinel SARI
hospitalizations were higher than the previous week in the Republic of
Moldova and Romania but remain below previously observed peak levels
for this season. In Armenia, Georgia, Serbia, and Ukraine, SARI
hospitalizations have decreased compared to recent weeks, but they
still remain above pre-season levels. SARI hospitalizations were
stable and generally low in Kazakhstan, Malta, and the Russian
Federation. In the 5 countries (Georgia, Kazakhstan, Romania, the
Russian Federation, and Ukraine) testing 10 or more sentinel SARI
specimens, the percentage testing positive for influenza ranged from
15 percent in Kazakhstan to 58 percent in Ukraine.

Virological situation -- week 11/2011 [14-20 Mar 2011]
--------------------------------------------------
Pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 was reported to be dominant in 9
countries and co-dominant with influenza B in 10 countries. Influenza
B was dominant in 6 countries.

Sentinel physicians collected 912 respiratory specimens, of which 298
(33 percent) were positive for influenza virus: 89 (30 percent) were
influenza A and 209 (70 percent) were influenza B. Of the influenza A
viruses, 82 were subtyped: 68 (83 percent) as pandemic A(H1) and 14
(17 percent) as A(H3). In the 15 countries testing 20 or more sentinel
specimens, influenza positivity ranged from 0 percent in France to 88
percent in Georgia, with a median of 31 percent (mean: 35 percent). In
addition, 1707 non-sentinel specimens were reported positive for
influenza: 1117 (65 percent) influenza A; and 590 (35 percent)
influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 999 were subtyped: 968 (97
percent) as pandemic A(H1) and 31 (3 percent) as A(H3).

Out of 155 sentinel SARI specimens collected during week 11/2011
[14-20 Mar 2011] (data from 9 countries), 62 (40 percent) tested
positive for influenza: 37 (60 percent) were influenza A; 25 (40
percent) were influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 23 were
subtyped and all were pandemic A(H1).

Cumulative virological update -- weeks 40/2010-11/2011 [4 Oct 2010-20
Mar 2011]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 80 531 influenza virus detections was reported during this
period, of which 57 673 (72 percent) were influenza A and 22 858 (28
percent) were influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 45 626 were
subtyped: 43 997 (96 percent) as pandemic A(H1), 1628 (4 percent) as
influenza A(H3), and 1 as influenza A(H1).

From week 40/2010 [4-10 Oct 2010] to week 11/2011, 1400 out of 4424
sentinel SARI specimens (32 percent) tested positive for influenza. Of
these influenza viruses, 770 (55 percent) were influenza A and 630 (45
percent) influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 505 were subtyped:
464 (92 percent) as pandemic A(H1) and 41 (8 percent) as influenza
A(H3).

Since week 40/2010, 3699 influenza viruses have been characterized
antigenically: 1837 were A(H1) pandemic A/California/7/2009
(H1N1)-like; 1615 were B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (B/Victoria/2/87
lineage); 113 were A(H3) A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like; 133 were
B/Florida/4/2006-like (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage); and 1 was
B/Bangladesh/3333/2007-like (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage). Based on the
genetic characterization of 519 influenza viruses, 215 belonged to the
pandemic A/California/7/2009 A(H1N1) clade; 10 belonged to the
pandemic A/Christchurch/16/2010 A(H1) clade; 46 belonged to the
pandemic A/Hong Kong/2213/2010 A(H1) clade; 41 were reported as A(H1)
pandemic not attributed to group category but belonging to the
recently emerged A/England/142/2010 subgroup characterized by S185T
substitution in the HA; 11 belonged to the A(H3) clade represented by
A/Perth/16/2009; 7 belonged to the A(H3) clade represented by
A/Victoria/208/2009; 30 belonged to the subgroup represented by A/Hong
Kong/2121/2010 in the A/Victoria/208/2009 A(H3) clade; 19 belonged to
the B/Bangladesh/3333/2007 clade (Yamagata lineage); and 140 to the
B/Brisbane/60/2008 clade (Victoria lineage).

Since week 40/2010, 8 countries (Germany, Ireland, Italy,
Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, and the UK) have screened
1444 viruses for susceptibility to the neuraminidase inhibitors
oseltamivir and zanamivir. The UK analysed most of the viruses
screened (735). Out of the 1333 pandemic A(H1N1) 2009 viruses that
were tested, 1291 were sensitive to both inhibitors and 42 viruses
(3.2 percent) carried the NA H275Y mutation. These 42 viruses were
resistant to oseltamivir but remained sensitive to zanamivir. 4
influenza A(H3N2) viruses were tested and found to be sensitive to
both inhibitors. All of the 107 influenza B viruses tested for
susceptibility to oseltamivir and the 96 tested for susceptibility to
zanamivir were found to be sensitive. All 178 pandemic influenza
A(H1N1) 2009 viruses and 2 A(H3N2) viruses that were screened for
susceptibility to adamantanes were found to be resistant.

Comment
-------
ILI and ARI consultation rates continue to decline throughout most
parts of the WHO European Region with all countries reporting medium
or low activity during week 11/2011 [14-20 Mar 2011]. Significant
influenza activity continues in some places however. The overall
percentage of sentinel ILI, ARI, and SARI specimens testing positive
for influenza has declined from about 40 percent in previous weeks to
33 percent in week 11/2011 [14-20 Mar 2011]. The percentage of
sentinel specimens testing positive was highest in weeks 4 and 5 [24
Jan-6 Feb 2011] (46 percent) and corresponded to the peak of clinical
influenza activity, which occurred during weeks 4 to 6 in 26 out of 40
countries. Influenza B and pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 co-dominate
in the Region.

[In brief: influenza is now in decline over most of Europe.

geographical spread, and impact) and the dominant virus as assessed by
each of the countries. This information can be accessed by clicking on
