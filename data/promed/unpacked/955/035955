From February 2006 to 10 Oct 2006, the WHO Regional Office for South-East
Asia has reported 151 districts in 8 states/provinces of India affected by
chikungunya fever (see below). The affected states are Andhra Pradesh,
Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat,
Madhya Pradesh, Kerala and Delhi. More than 1.25 million suspected cases
have been reported from the country, which 752 245 were from Karnataka and
258 998 from Maharashtra provinces. In some areas reported attack rates
have reached 45 percent.
A team from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, health officials
from Kerala and staff from the WHO India Office and Regional Office for
South-East Asia investigated the outbreak in Kerala [see Chikungunya -
India (10): Kerala 20061013.2931, below]. They carried out clinical and
epidemiological examinations of suspected cases in hospitals and at home,
and collected clinical samples. An entomological survey revealed high
densities of _Aedes albopictus_ in the affected areas as well as in areas
not affected by the disease.
For personal protection, individuals should take measures to protect
themselves against the bites of the mosquitoes which transmit the virus
(including _Aedes aegypti_), which are active during the daytime.
Elimination of breeding sites can contribute to the reduction of mosquito
densities. As a result, a key recommendation from the investigation team is
for urgent vector control measures coupled with an intensive awareness
campaign in the community. Health care staff at all levels, government
officials and nongovernmental organizations are called upon to assist in
this information and health education campaign. The
Communication-for-Behavioural Impact methodology has been successful in
mobilizing affected populations for vector control activities.

[This WHO report provides a good summary of chikungunya cases in India to
10 Oct 2006 and a comprehensive idea of the extent and intensity of the
chikungunya epidemic there. It will be interesting to have more detail on
the mosquito vector control efforts as they progress.
