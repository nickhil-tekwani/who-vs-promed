Outbreak of viral disease examined; one death
---------------------------------------------
AJK (Azad Jammu & Kashmir) health authorities on Sat 20 May 2006 said they
were examining the outbreak of a deadly viral disease in a mountain
village, after 7 members of a family suspected of having been infected were
taken to Islamabad for specialized treatment, adding that one of them
perished on the way.
District health officer [for] Muzaffarabad, Dr Sardar Mahmood Ahmed Khan,
told Dawn that on Saturday [20 May 2006] morning, 3 victims, a 40 year old
man and his 2 sons -- 9 and 7 years old -- came to a field hospital of the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Dhanni village with
complaints of fever and bleeding. Dhanni is around 40 km north east of here
along the Neelum Valley road, and the victims are said to be from the
nearby Nauseri village.
Dr Khan said that ICRC officials sent the victims to Muzaffarabad, from
where they were taken to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS),
Islamabad for "further investigation and specialized treatment." The father
died on the way to the PIMS, while his sons were admitted there, he said.
The DHO said that the victims were suffering from fever and hematuria and
had developed hemorrhagic spots on their bodies, which was why health
authorities suspected an outbreak of the contagious Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in their area.
CCHF is caused by infection with a tickborne virus. Doctors say its onset
is sudden with initial signs and symptoms including headache, high fever,
back pain, joint pain, stomach pain and vomiting. Red eyes, a flushed face,
a red throat, and petechiae (red spots) on the palate are common.
The DHO said later in the afternoon that 4 other members of the same family
-- the father's 35 year old wife, 28 year old sister-in-law, 4 year old
daughter, and 18 month old son -- were also taken to Muzaffarabad and sent
to the PIMS.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is a tick-transmitted virus disease which
is prevalent throughout Pakistan, and the inhabitants of rural areas are
most at risk. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a member of
the genus _Nairovirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_, a family of segmented
genome negative-sense RNA viruses. CCHFV is the cause of a zoonotic disease
that for many years was recognized only in Central Asia and eastern Europe,
but is known now to be present throughout Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.
In recent years, CCHFV-associated disease has been particularly prevalent
in countries bordering the Persian Gulf, where traditional sheep
slaughtering and butchering practices continue. The virus is maintained by
a cycle involving transovarial and transstadial transmission in _Hyalomma_
spp. and related ticks. The larval and nymphal ticks become infected during
feeding on small mammals and birds and the adults during feeding on wild
and domestic ruminants. Infection of wild and domestic ruminants results in
abundant production of CCHFV. Remarkably, there is no evidence of clinical
disease in animals other than humans, where the outcome can be a severe
hemorrhagic fever.
The circumstances surrounding the suspected outbreak of CCHFV infection in
the North West Frontier Province are not stated. Further information would
be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
