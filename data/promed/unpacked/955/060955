The Japanese veterinary authorities have reported that no further outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza have taken place.

According to follow-up report no. 1 sent to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), culling of susceptible animals started on 13 Apr 2014 and was completed on 14 Apr 2014.

Carcasses of destroyed birds and contaminated materials were buried and farm premises were disinfected.

These control measures were completed on 16 Apr 2014. Movement restrictions (3 km [about 1.9 mile] radius around the affected farm and the related farm) and shipping restrictions (3-10 km [about 1.9-6.2 mile] radius around the affected farm and the related farm) are continuing.

There are 3 farms/premises rearing poultry within the movement restriction zones and they are under surveillance.

A total of 17 disinfection stations were established in and around the restriction zones.

On 15 Apr 2014, the National Institute of Animal Health (NIAH) confirmed that the isolated virus is highly pathogenic to birds, based on genetic sequencing.

On 17 Apr 2014, the NA subtype was confirmed as N8 by NIAH.

On 15 Apr 2014, virus isolation and virus sequencing tests were carried out, and on 17 Apr 2014, a haemagglutination inhibition test (HIT) was conducted. All tests resulted positive.

The source of the outbreaks still remains inconclusive.
