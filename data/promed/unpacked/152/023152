[The following is the main body of the telebriefing comment by Dr. Lyle Petersen, Director, Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, USA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. - Mod.TY]

"As of 28 Aug 2012, a total of 48 states have reported West Nile virus infections in people, birds or mosquitoes. Only Alaska and Hawaii have reported no West Nile virus activity; 43 states have reported at least one human case of West Nile virus disease. CDC received reports of 1590 cases of West Nile virus disease in people, including 66 deaths. Of these, 889 (56 per cent) were classified as neuroinvasive disease, such as meningitis or encephalitis; and 701 (or 44 per cent) were classified as non-neuroinvasive disease. These numbers represent a 40 per cent increase over last week's report of 1118 total cases, 629 neuroinvasive disease cases, and 41 deaths. The 1590 cases reported thus far in 2012 is the highest number of West Nile virus disease cases reported to the CDC through the last week in August since West Nile virus was 1st detected in the United States in 1999. More than 70 per cent of the cases have been reported from 6 states, which in descending order are Texas, South Dakota, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Michigan. Nearly half of the cases are from Texas.

We cannot accurately predict how many human cases will be reported this year [2012]. However, based on current reports, we think the numbers may come close to or even exceed the total number reported in the epidemic years of 2002 and 2003, when about 3000 cases of neuroinvasive disease and more than 260 deaths were reported each year. Because cases of West Nile fever (or "non-neuroinvasive disease") are very underreported, we think that cases of neuroinvasive disease are the best measure of the severity of the epidemic. From what we've seen in West Nile epidemics in previous years, we expect that this year's epidemic will peak in mid to late August 2012. The incidence of infection may peak earlier in southern states than in northern ones.

And now I'd like to say a few words about Hurricane Isaac and the question of how it might affect the spread of West Nile virus. Previous experience has shown that floods and hurricanes do not typically result in increased transmission of West Nile virus. Thus, we expect Hurricane Isaac will likely have no noticeable effect on the current West Nile epidemic. Nevertheless, small increases in the numbers of West Nile cases were noted in some areas of Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina. These were thought to be due to increased outdoor exposure that occurred when houses were severely damaged and during recovery efforts. CDC has reached out to health departments in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee to alert them of the situation and offer assistance. In light of the ongoing risk for West Nile virus infection, it's important for people to protect themselves from mosquito bites.

We encourage everyone to use insect repellent when you go outdoors, wear long sleeves and pants. Use air conditioning if possible. Empty stands water from items outside your home, such as gutters, kiddie pools and birdbaths. In response to this year's [2012] outbreak, CDC works closely with state and local health departments particularly in areas hardest hit by the epidemic. As I noted earlier, nearly half of this year's West Nile virus cases have occurred in Texas. A majority of the cases there have been in the Dallas area. CDC has had the privilege of working with the Texas department of state health services in Dallas County and other county departments to help protect people from the West Nile virus.

[The USA CDC, in collaboration with state health departments, is tracking new cases of human West Nile virus infection. It will be interesting to see whether hurricane Isaac has any effect on vector mosquito populations and subsequent transmission to humans and equine animals. No mention is made of equine case numbers in the above report, but they are available at the site below.

West Nile virus activity is surging in southern Ontario, and the province may be on track to equal its worst year ever in terms of total cases, an official with Public Health Ontario said Wednesday [29 Aug 2012].

"It's near impossible to predict what the future holds for West Nile virus in the next number of weeks," said Dr. Colin Lee, acting medical director of communicable diseases at Public Health Ontario. "But what it would be fair to say is that there will be mosquitoes still infected with the West Nile virus likely till at least mid-September [2012]."

Public Health Ontario reported that as of Tuesday [28 Aug 2012], there have been 82 people who have been confirmed or are deemed probable West Nile cases in the province this year. That's higher than any comparable period in Ontario since 2002, the province's worst West Nile year on record. In 2002, Ontario recorded 186 West Nile virus cases by the end of August 2002. By the time the 2002 season was over, 394 cases were recorded.

With several weeks of mosquito activity likely ahead and a long incubation period for the disease, this year's [2012] case count could approach that territory. "I think that's certainly possible, that we could reach what we did in 2002," Lee said.

The incubation period -- the time from infection to manifestation of symptoms -- can be as long as 14 days with West Nile infection. That means people being infected now may not come to light for several weeks. It could easily take that amount of time for people who are going to become severely ill to develop symptoms, seek medical care, get tested and then receive a test result.

So far this year [2012], 4 other provinces have reported cases: Quebec, 11; Manitoba, 9; Alberta, 4 and Saskatchewan, one.

The epicentre of Ontario's outbreak is Toronto, where there have already been 44 confirmed cases, and 18 people have been hospitalized with the disease, Toronto Public Health said Wednesday [29 Aug 2012].

So far this year [2012], there have been no fatal cases in Canada.

The confirmed and probable cases are only a fraction of the true number of infections, Lee noted. With West Nile virus, about 80 per cent of people who are infected don't develop symptoms.

The remaining 20 per cent will become ill, but most will have flu-like complaints -- fever, headache, body aches -- which can last for a few days or even some weeks. Lee said most of those people don't seek medical care; the U.S. CDC estimates between 2-3 per cent of people who develop West Nile fever end up being diagnosed.

But about one out of every 150 people infected with the virus go on to develop severe disease, which requires medical care. Their symptoms can include high fever, muscle weakness, numbness, even paralysis.

A portion of the people who develop West Nile virus neurological syndrome do not make a full recovery.

Ontario officials were expecting this year [2012] could be a bad one for West Nile, Lee said. "Given the early start to summer this year and the number of early hot days and the number of mosquito pools that were positive (for virus) at the beginning of summer, we somewhat expected that we would have a larger-than-usual amount of people infected with West Nile [virus]," he said.
