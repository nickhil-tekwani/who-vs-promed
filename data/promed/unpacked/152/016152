The next 10 days or so will be crucial in the fight against the bird flu
virus [influenzavirus A H5N1, government sources said yesterday. As the
slaughter of more than 1.4 million birds was completed, the sources pledged
quick action if the virus spread to other poultry. One official said they
had formulated four scenarios after the first case of bird flu in May:
1. The first was for an isolated case;
2. The second envisaged a ''cluster of cases'' which was also quickly over;
3. The third was for a situation where there were hundreds of cases, but
the outbreak was contained; and
4. The last, and worst, scenario was for the disease to become a world
epidemic.
"If there is an outbreak here, it will spread around the world in one to
two months," she said. "I believe we are now at the second scenario ... but
the next 10 days or two weeks will be crucial."
Test results from 400 samples taken from poultry on Monday, during the
first day of the mass cull, will be available next Tuesday. Initial
results on pigeons showed that none had the virus, she said. "If no more
new cases are found in the next two weeks, we can say the first cluster of
cases is over." Work would then continue to trace the origin of the virus
and its development. "At present, we will stick to our earlier assessment
that the efficiency of the human-to-human transmission is weak," she said.
The Government had already formulated comprehensive plans, but had decided
not to disclose details to avoid causing panic. Details would be given to
Provisional Legislative Council members next week. It is understood [that
places which attracted large crowds would be closed if no vaccine was ready
to battle a massive outbreak of bird flu. The contingency plan and the
mass slaughter of 1.4 million poultry are expected to be part of a special
H5N1 briefing by health and agriculture officials to Executive Councillors
tomorrow.
Deputy Director of Health Dr. Paul Saw Thian-aun said the Government would
decide this month whether to produce the vaccine, depending on factors such
as the possibility of human-to-human transmission. But he said mass
production would take at least five to six months to prepare. Dr. Saw told
Provisional Legislators yesterday that the contingency plan has been
prepared to cope with a scenario in which bird flu developed into an
epidemic, but no vaccine was available. "Under such a plan, we would have
to depend on the use of amantadine in the treatment of cases," he said.
Meanwhile, the outbreak of the bird flu has provoked Thailand's Bangkok
International Airport to impose checks on [Hong Kong visitors. The
mainland [China will issue a notice over the next two days to stop Hong
Kong visitors carrying poultry into China.
