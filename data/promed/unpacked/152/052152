[1] Coconut mite, red palm weevil - India (Goa)

Pests eat into coconut yield in Bicholim
----------------------------------------
The considerable drop of about 40-50 per cent of coconut yield this year
[2010] in Bicholim [subdistrict] have become a matter of deep concern to
agriculturists and coconut growers. Zonal agriculture officer Pradeep Malik
said the major factor that has affected yield is mite attack, which leads
to hardening of the outer cover, reduces the size of a coconut, and affects
the pulp inside. He said potash fertilisers have proved to be effective to
fight mite attack.

About 2500 hectares [approx 6200 acres] of land is under coconut
cultivation in Bicholim. The total [average] coconut yield was about 200
000 nuts which may fall this year [2010], Mr Malik said.

The coconut trees are also attacked by red palm weevils, locally called
'ronto'. However, the use of thymate, oiled karanj cake, and oiled neem
cake can keep the ronto off the coconut plants, Mr Malik observed. If the
coconut plants are infested by ronto, the plant dies slowly as ronto
attacks inside the stem of a palm and cannot be detected at an early stage.

[2] Coconut leaf beetle - Philippines (Southern Leyte)
Date: Tue 13 Apr 2010

<http://ricgor.blogspot.com/2010/04/brontispa-infestation-now-affects-10.html>


Brontispa infestation now affects 10 southern Leyte towns
---------------------------------------------------------
_Brontispa longgissima_, or coconut leaflets infestation, has now affected
10 municipalities of this province, and the pest has damaged around 600 000
coconut trees in the region.

OPAG (Office of the Provincial Agriculturist) has suspected that germinated
nuts [used] as planting material have been infected with brontispa. Mostly
non-bearing trees that were newly planted were affected. [It is suggested
that] there is a great probability that the pest has its source in Bicol
[region]. Coconut leaf pests can be carried by any type of vehicle. Another
presumption is that the coconut seeds distributed from nurseries somewhere
in Leyte allegedly have mother palms from Bicol.

Albert Esclamado, Committee on Tourism, considered the infestation a "very
serious matter" that would have an adverse effect to the livelihood of an
estimated 80 per cent constituents in this province who are relying on
coconut products. [It has been decided] to take immediate action by a
massive information campaign, the prohibition of movement of palm
seedlings, the establishment of check points, the implementation of a Plant
Industry Special order and the provision of funds.

[Coconut mite (CM)
------------------
The eriophyid coconut mite (_Aceria guerreronis_) is one of the worst
arthropod pests of the coconut palm. It occurs in many coconut growing
areas and attacks the young fruits. The mites build up into large
populations but can only be seen with a magnifying lens, the largest stage
being around 250 micrometers. CM is spread by wind, and colonisation takes
place shortly after flower fertilisation peaking on 3-6 month old nuts.
Numbers then start to decline sharply. A dramatic extension to CM
distribution occurred in 1990 when it was found, for the 1st time, in
Tanzania, India, and Sri Lanka. It has not yet been reported from the South
Pacific.

CM breeds under the perianth (flower envelop) of the coconut. The 1st sign
of damage is a white streak on immature fruit resulting from chlorosis of
the cells. The damaged cells eventually become suberised and hence appear
brown. As the nut grows the cells around the damaged area multiply creating
stress, which results in the development of deep fissures. In extreme
cases, 80 per cent of the surface of the maturing nut is affected. The
application of boron and neem cake is said to be effective.

Red palm weevil (RPW)
---------------------
The red palm weevil (_Rhynchophorus ferrugineus_) is a relatively large
beetle 2 to 5 cm long with a rusty red colour. 1st information on RPW was
published in India in 1891, and it is now a very important economic pest of
coconut, oil, and date palms. From tropical Asia the pest has spread to
Africa and Europe and has been reported in 2009 in the Caribbean.

RPW usually infests palms younger than 12 years. The adult causes some
damage through feeding on the leaves, but the female lays around 200 eggs
on new growth at the base of the crown. The larvae excavate holes up to a
meter long into the trunk and can kill the plant. Several generations can
be inside a trunk feeding. The total life cycle is 7-10 weeks. The crown of
the palm wilts due to damage to the vascular tissue, but this usually only
becomes obvious long after the trunk has been infested, and by this time
the tree is dying. Sounds of the larvae burrowing and chewing can be heard
by placing one's ear to the trunk. Electronic listening devices are used
occasionally for detection of the pest.

Control of RPW is through insecticides poured, with the aid of a funnel, 5
cm above the infested area. Since the weevil prefers to lay its eggs in
softer tissues, avoiding mechanical damage to plants can help to reduce
infestation, as can tarring of wounds. Also, mechanical damage to mature
leaves should be avoided.

Coconut leaf beetle (CLB)
-------------------------
The coconut leaf beetle (_Brontispa longissima_) is nocturnal and around
7.5-10 mm long. It is distributed throughout the Indonesian and Pacific
area north to Taiwan. The adult male is smaller than the female. Larvae and
adults remain in the unopened leaflets moving out only to mate or to infest
other palms. CLB is only capable of short flights of a few hundred meters.
Eggs hatch in 3-7 days to form larvae, which undergo 6 instars within 30-50
days. The whole life cycle takes 3-9 weeks. Larvae chew on leaflets at the
spear (youngest emerging) leaf causing longitudinal white streaks of dead
tissue. As the leaf expands the leaflets curl and turn brown giving a
characteristic scorched, ragged appearance. Control is by various
insecticides. However 2 parasitoids of CLB, _Tetrastichus brontispae_ and
_Asecodes hispinarum_, have been used successfully in biocontrol. Use of
the entomopathogenic fungus _Metarhizium anisopliae_ also appears promising.
