Some 20 horses have died in the past 2 months, as a consequence of a
presumed outbreak of equine encephalitis which agricultural producers
on the east coast of Falcon [state] have not been able to control.
This was the report from Williams Muskus, secretary of the Cattle
Producers Association of the Laurencio Silva municipality, who also
underscored that the situation has caused alarm among the population
and the agricultural producers of the area. "We request that the
authorities in charge undertake [efforts] as quickly as possible to
solve this situation that is causing anxiety among Falcon residents."

For his part, Juan Mendoza, veterinarian and animal producer of the
east coast of Falcon [state], indicated that they still await results
from the Veterinary Research Institute (IVV), "perhaps out of fear or
because they are not allowed to, they do not tell us about what
killed the horses; it seems to us if the animals died of equine fever
[encephalitis] they must inform us so that this disease does not
reach people who work in the countryside and deal with them directly."

Mendoza stated that until now, he just has information about the 20
horses that died; however, the number of deaths might have been lower
due to the application of vitamins [?], expired vaccines [?], which
did not permit the spread of the epidemic, or because the pertinent
tests were not available [and cases were not diagnosed] .

"We must remember that this disease [virus] can be transmitted to
human beings. Although no [human] cases have yet been reported, the
situation alarms us, because the health authorities have not said
anything, or even come to us to be apprised of the situation," [he said].

[If this is, indeed, a small outbreak of Venezuelan equine
encephalitis (VEE), there is reason to be concerned. Historically,
VEE has sporadically caused massive outbreaks in Venezuela with
thousands of equine cases, with equine case fatality rates in South
America reaching up to 80 percent. During these outbreaks, there have
also been many human infections. The human case fatality rate has
been less than one percent but morbidity rates can be high, with so
many acute cases that hospitals have been filled. It would be of
interest to know if the recent severe flooding in Falcon state over
the past 2 months has increased or decreased the populations of
mosquitoes that transmit VEE virus. There is an effective vaccine
against VEE virus infections for equine use.

There were conflicting reports about the occurrence of VEE in horses
in Venezuela in early July 2010, that was refuted by the Minister of
Agriculture after earlier reports appeared in the popular press. The
last officially reported VEE outbreak in equine animals was in 2004.
There was, however, a VEE outbreak along the Caribbean coast of
neighboring Colombia in July and August 2010. ProMED-mail would be
interested in receiving confirmation (or not) of the etiology of
these cases, and of any new cases (equine or human) occurring in the
Falcon area.
