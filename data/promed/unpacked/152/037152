Scientific opinion on African swine fever (EFSA Panel on Animal Health
and Welfare)
-------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
The risk that African swine fever virus (ASFV) remains endemic in the
Trans- Caucasian Countries (TCC) and the Russian Federation (RF) is
moderate, while the risk of its spread in these regions is high. The
resulting risk of introduction from these regions into the EU is
moderate, most likely through food waste.

The risk of ASFV remaining endemic in wild boar and the consequent
introduction into the EU was considered low in the TCC and moderate in
the RF, mainly due to the higher population density in the RF and the
connected wild boar populations to the EU from the RF. Within the EU,
mainly domestic pigs in the free range (FR) and the limited
biosecurity sector (LB) are likely to be exposed to ASFV via swill
feeding, with low risk. Once infected, the risk of spread from the LB
and FR sectors prior [to?] detection is high, mainly due to movement
of pigs, people,and vehicles and moderate from the High Biosecurity
(HB) sector.

The risk of endemicity in domestic pigs is considered negligible in HB
and low in LB since the implementation of control measures is
effective. The risk of endemicity in the FR sector is moderate due to
wild boar contact, non-compliance with yhe animal movement ban and
difficult access to all individual pigs. The risk of ASFV becoming
endemic in the wild boar population in the EU is moderate, in
particular in areas with connected wild boar populations.

Because of their long life, ticks of the _Ornithodoros erraticus_
complex can be important in maintaining local foci of ASFV, where pigs
are kept under traditional systems. Ticks do not play an active role
in the geographical spread of the virus. Wild boar have never been
found infested because they do not rest inside burrows potentially
infested by ticks.
