It was just a small tick on her foot, just part of working in the woods, the woman thought. "My husband took it off with a pair of tweezers, didn't think anything else about it," she said. Then weeks later, she woke up in the middle of the night swollen with hives and unable to breathe. "They said I was probably 20 minutes from dying at that point, so it was scary, one tick," she said.

Eventually, doctors figured out the woman had developed a severe food allergy. That lone tick bite left her completely unable to eat red meat. "It's actually called the unintentional diet," she said. "This is to the point that if I didn't make those changes, I'd die."

Doctors are seeing more and more of this rare allergy, which is actually not against the meat, but a sugar on red meat called alpha gal. "It's very new. This disease is really first described in 2008," allergist Dr James DeAngelo said.

Alpha gal is also in the saliva of the biting tick, which is how the allergy starts. All mammals carry the sugar, except primates. Humans are primates, and therefore react against the sugar in other mammalian meat. Steaks and burgers could cause a problem, but not chicken or fish.

"It's also dose dependent. Unlike the peanut allergy, where even a little drop can cause a reaction, in this case, it's very hard to reproduce. In other words, the person has to consume enough beef to produce an allergic reaction, and then you have to wait, [up to 8] hours afterwards to confirm the reaction," Dr DeAngelo explains.

The Lone Star tick is seen mostly in the eastern and south eastern USA. Its area is expanding and includes Pennsylvania. Dr DeAngelo says local tick analysis has not shown any in Allegheny County, though residents have found the tick on themselves, but it's thought to be brought from other areas.

The allergy can be confirmed with blood tests, though these aren't FDA [Food and Drugs Administration] approved yet, and could be a big out-of-pocket expense. There are no shots or tablets available for densensitization. But the allergy can be self-limited. "Fortunately, it does go away. In the majority of the cases, if the person avoids future tick bites, it will gradually diminish over time," DeAngelo said.

If you've been spending a lot of time outdoors and have suddenly developed an allergy to red meat, you may want to check yourself for ticks. The Lone Star tick can set off a potentially life-threatening red meat allergy. That's what happened to an outdoorsman and arborist from Tulsa, Oklahoma. He told CBS Tulsa affiliate KOTV that he didn't remember any ticks biting him, but a severe allergic reaction after eating a taco last fall prompted him to seek medical attention. "Itching, hives, sweating, couldn't breathe, throat closed up," he recalled the terrifying reaction.

Doctors can be slow to recognize the problem, and the man's trip to the ER failed to provide him with answers. After a 2nd reaction to eating a cheeseburger a few days later, the avid carnivore went to an allergy clinic for testing. "They said, oh, well, you're allergic to red meat. And I asked, I said, Are you sure you're looking at the right person? Because that's what I've lived on my whole life. And they said, Yeah, this is you," he said.

The Lone Star tick, found in the south and the eastern half of the USA, carries a sugar called alpha-gal that humans don't have. This sugar is also found in red meat, beef, pork, venison, rabbit, and some dairy products. When the tick bites, it can trigger a person's immune system to create antibodies to the sugar that, in turn, cause their body to reject red meat, setting off a serious allergic reaction.

And, because the slightest cross contamination could be fatal, dining out can become a matter of life and death for those affected. The man is now restricting his diet to "fins" and "feathers," just fish and poultry. "Seafood's not bad, but there's only so many ways you can cook chicken and turkey," he said laughing.

This man, and others affected by the allergy, have reason to hope for a time when they can reintroduce red meat into their diets. Doctors have yet to confirm whether the allergy is permanent, and there is a chance some people will grow out of it. But, be warned, if you get another tick bite, the allergy will return along with the severe symptoms.

Though this patient's reaction occurred almost immediately, the symptoms can take up to 8 hours to show after ingesting red meat in some cases. Allergic reactions can be treated with antihistamines to ease itching. In case of an extreme reaction, the patient carries a medicine kit with an epinephrine shot.

[It seems that in some tick-endemic areas, this association is being increasingly recognized. One relevant study was published in 2011 [Commins SP, James HR, Kelly LA, et al. The relevance of tick bites to the production of IgE antibodies to the mammalian oligosaccharide galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose. J Allerg Clin Immunol. 2011;127: 1286-1293.] The abstract can be found in ProMED-mail: Lone star tick - USA: link to meat allergy 20120623.1178567.

It has been known for several decades that an immunological reaction occurs to tick salivary antigens in animals fed on by the tick. Indeed, a large amount of research has been published regarding the protection of humans and animals from tickborne diseases by immunization with tick antigens which may block the ability of the tick to transmit infection (for a review, see: Lee R, Opdebeeck JP. Arthropod vaccines [in: New vaccines and new vaccine technologies, Lutwick LI (editor)]. Infect Dis N Am. 1999;13: 209-226).

This study came about related to the monoclonal antibody cetuximab, which is specific for epidermal growth factor receptor and was approved for use in treating cancer in 2005. Subsequently, it became clear that a significant number of treated patients were experiencing severe hypersensitivity reactions during their 1st infusion of this monoclonal antibody. Those reports appeared to be restricted to an area of the southeastern USA, including Tennessee, North Carolina, Arkansas, Virginia, and the southern half of Missouri. In 2007, a detailed investigation of serum antibodies established that these reactions were occurring in patients who had preexisting IgE antibodies specific for the glycosylation on the Fab fragment of the monoclonal antibody. The relevant oligosaccharide was found to be galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal), which is a blood group substance of non-primate mammals.

Of note, the known distribution of the immediate reactions to cetuximab was similar to the areas with high prevalence of Rocky Mountain spotted fever and human ehrlichiosis. The authors of the paper became aware of patients who thought that reactions to red meat started after receiving multiple tick bites and were informed that several allergists had reported to their local allergy meetings about patients who had become allergic to meat after experiencing multiple tick bites.

Diseases linked to _A. americanum_ include erlichiosis, tularemia and STARI (Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness, http://www.cdc.gov/stari/disease/). Pictures of the lone star tick, including one of engorging female _A. americanum_ ticks, can be found at: http://www.tickinfo.com/lonestartick.htm.

It is increasingly clear that the same delayed (3-6 hours) IgE mediated hypersensitivity from meat can be associated with other ticks such as _Ixodes holocyclus_ in Australia (1) and _I. ricinus_ in Sweden (2) and Spain (3); and not only can beef be an issue, but also lamb, pork and game (1). Additionally, alpha-gal has been identified in the gastrointestinal tract of ticks (2). The curious delayed nature of a usually rapid onset immune reaction may be explained by the slower absorption of the alpha-gal expressing glycoproteins transported with dietary triglycerides (4).
