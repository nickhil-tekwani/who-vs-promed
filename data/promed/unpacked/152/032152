China's animal feed tainted with melamine
-----------------------------------------
The industrial chemical melamine is commonly added to animal feed in
China to make it appear higher in protein, state media reported
Thursday [30 Oct 2008], in what appeared to be a tacit admission by
the government that contamination is widespread in the country's food
supply.

The practice of mixing melamine into animal feed is an "open secret"
in the industry, the Nanfang Daily newspaper reported, describing a
process of repackaging melamine scrap into an inexpensive product
called "protein powder," which is then sold to feed suppliers.

The Web sites of the official Xinhua News Agency and the Communist
Party mouthpiece People's Daily newspaper also carried the story, in
a rare move publicizing information that reflects poorly on the
country -- especially given recent food safety scandals involving
contaminated Chinese dairy products and eggs.

City fish food checked for melamine content
-------------------------------------------
Shanghai will carry out full-scale checks on feed used in the
fisheries industry due to fears that the widening melamine-tainted
food scandal may spread to seafood. Shanghai's Livestock Office said
yesterday [30 Oct 2008] that the checks would cover more than 100
feed producers in the city. Further inspections on seafood would
start if any food given to fish was found to be contaminated with
melamine.

The level of protein is a key element in determining food standards
in China. Melamine raises protein readings but not the protein
content. The chemical is a banned animal-feed additive, according to
a notice issued by the Ministry of Agriculture in July 2007.

The Shanghai Evening Post yesterday cited an industry insider as
saying that adding melamine in feed is a common practice as producers
seek to raise protein readings at less expense. The chemical, used to
make plastics, paint and adhesives, has been used in the feed
industry for at least 5 years, the insider told the evening
newspaper. The source added that cows, sheep, poultry, pigs and fish
had been given food containing melamine. Soft-shelled turtles and
eels were also on the melamine list, especially in southern China,
the paper said.

Melamine waste residue is sold by its producers for between 600 yuan
(US$87) and 800 yuan a ton to animal feed firms. Those companies then
add the melamine residue to feed and sell that feed for up to 4000
(US$580) yuan a ton on the market, according to the newspaper.

Feed factory representative arrested in tainted eggs scandal
------------------------------------------------------------
The legal representative of a feed factory has been arrested after
melamine was found in its products, according to Dalian Hanwei
Enterprise Group, a producer of eggs that contained an excessive
amount of the industrial chemical in its products, Beijing News
reported today [30 Oct 2008 ].

Han Wei, president of Dalian Hanwei, said the unidentified legal
representative of Shenyang City-based Xinmin Mingxing Feed Factory
was in police custody, according to the report.

The Hong Kong government found Dalian Hanwei's eggs contained
melamine because chickens were fed with tainted grain from Xinmin
Mingxing, Han was cited as saying. "The chemical was 1st discovered
during a check on grains by the company," Han told the newspaper.

Dalian Hanwei later issued a national recall of the problematic eggs
because "leaking water tainted the feed in the store house," the
report said. [A rather unlikely story. Even if the water was heavily
contaminated with melamine -- and where did that come from? -- the
feed would have had to be thoroughly soaked to have reached a level
of contamination high enough to pass through the chickens it was fed
to into their eggs. Soaked feed goes moldy quickly and cannot be sold
through normal channels. - Mod.JW]

On 22 Oct 2008, the Liaoning Province Animal Health Bureau ordered
its subordinate departments to examine and register feed products
made by Xinmin Mingxing Feed Factory. The bureau stated on its Web
site that it would not talk to media.

Dalian Hanwei Enterprise Group has been in business for 26 years and
is the biggest producer of eggs and egg products in China. It owns 4
egg farms, 3 of which are specifically for export. Tainted eggs
produced by Dalian Hanwei Group were 1st reported in Hong Kong on
Saturday [25 Oct 2008].
