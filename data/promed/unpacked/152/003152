Newcastle disease A160
----------------------
One new outbreak of Newcastle disease A160 was initially detected in
poultry near the town of Meredith, Victoria on 8 May 2002. The estimated
date of first infection is 18 Mar 2002
About 250 000 animals are susceptible and egg production has fallen by up
to 40 per cent in 4 to 6 weeks. Between 500 and 1000 deaths have occurred
over the same period. None of the poultry has been destroyed or slaughtered.
The outbreak has occurred in a poultry layer (egg production) enterprise
comprising of 9 atmospheric-controlled sheds, each shed containing between
22 000 and 25 000 birds.
The Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) in Geelong, Victoria made
the diagnosis, using serology, virus isolation, and DNA sequencing;
immunohistochemistry and intracerebral pathogenicity index results pending.
The causal agent is virulent Newcastle disease (ND) virus of Australian
origin (amino acid sequence of F cleavage site RRQRRF and a 9 amino acid
extension at the HN gene, indicating that the virus is identical, or almost
identical, to the 1999 Mangrove Mountain isolate of virulent ND virus of
Australian origin).
The mode of introduction to to the farm is unknown. Epidemiological
investigations are continuing. There has been no evidence of spread of
Newcastle disease from the infected property.
In mid to late March 2002 an enterprise near Meredith, western Victoria,
about 75 km west of Melbourne, experienced a significant decrease in egg
shell quality in 2 of 9 sheds. Over a period of 4 weeks, egg production
declined and 4 other sheds experienced a mild increase in mortality, but
within normal industry limits. Records of routine ND serology of the
enterprise show that there was no recent evidence of infection with any ND
virus before late March 2002. On 8 May 2002, upon suspicion of possible
virulent ND, diagnostic samples were despatched to AAHL, where a virulent
sequence was confirmed on 9 May. The suspect flock was quarantined on 8
May, with subsequent implementation of movement controls and restricted
area (RA or infected zone) of about 3 km and a control area (CA) of about
10 km around the affected property. Both areas are legally defined by the
use of Local Government Area boundaries. There are no other commercial
poultry farms within the RA, and only 5 broiler farms within the CA, all of
which show no evidence of ND.
Further epidemiological investigations are under way to attempt to identify
the source of the outbreak. At this time there are only 2 commercial layer
farms known to have had any links to the infected farm. Birds on both of
these farms remain healthy with no clinical or serological evidence of ND,
with results of further laboratory tests pending. At that time 4 very small
non-commercial or 'backyard' layer flocks in Victoria that received birds
from the index farm were placed in quarantine, with precautionary
destruction of all 380 birds in these flocks. The response plan developed
by Victoria and approved by Australia's Consultative Committee on Emergency
Animal Diseases (CCEAD) and the National Management Group on 13 May 2002,
aims to eradicate of virulent ND virus infection associated with this incident.
This will be achieved by a stamping-out policy with the maintenance of
strict quarantine and movement controls to prevent any spread of the
disease, detailed and targeted monitoring and surveillance programs to
determine the presence and distribution of ND viruses, disposal of infected
and contaminated products and materials as necessary, and intensive
clean-up and decontamination of the infected premises.
Destruction of birds is scheduled to take 5 days, beginning on 14 May 2002,
with disposal by deep burial on-site. The rest of Victoria and Australia
outside of the CA continues to remain free of ND. No additional quarantine
or movement restrictions have been imposed by other Australian States and
Territories, beyond those imposed by Victorian authorities. The
Commonwealth Government and Victorian Government have created websites to
provide current information on this incident (follow links from:
<http://www.affa.gov.au/> and <http://www.nre.vic.gov.au/>, respectively).
A summary of Australia's past experience with ND and ND viruses follows.
Virulent ND virus first occurred in Australia in 1930 and 1932. Then, and
in a subsequent outbreak in 1932, the disease was successfully eradicated
by a slaughter-out policy. In 1966, an avirulent strain of ND virus,
designated as V4, was identified. V4 virus and other avirulent strains have
since spread through much of the poultry industry in most states, except
for Western Australia. Some avirulent strains now also occur in some
species of wild birds. During the 1990s, strains of ND virus emerged that
were associated with mild disease. Some strains were found to have gene
sequences (at the fusion gene locus associated with virulence) that were
close to those that occur in virulent ND viruses. In September 1998, a
virulent ND virus emerged on a mixed layer and broiler farm at Deans Park,
western Sydney, New South Wales (NSW).
Genetic sequencing showed that this virus had originated from an endemic,
avirulent ND virus of Australian origin, and was distinctly genetically
different from ND viruses that occur overseas. In April 1999, a further
outbreak occurred at Mangrove Mountain on the NSW Central Coast, just north
of Sydney.
This outbreak was shown to be caused by an Australian-origin virulent ND
virus similar to the Deans Park virus. During investigations, several other
ND viruses with genetic sequences very close to those of virulent viruses
were also identified for the first time -- these are considered to be
precursor viruses to virulent ND viruses of Australian origin. Each of
these outbreaks was stamped out. In early 2000, further cases of ND due to
virulent ND virus of Australian origin occurred in western Sydney and
Tamworth, NSW. The Tamworth property was depopulated but it was decided
that a survey was needed to help define the distribution and type of ND
viruses circulating in Australia before taking response action on the
properties in western Sydney.
A national survey for ND virus was undertaken in the last quarter of 2000.
The survey sampling strategy was designed to ensure comprehensive coverage
of all sectors of the Australian commercial poultry industry. No isolates
of virulent ND virus were detected; no isolates with nucleotide sequence or
deduced cleavage sequences related to the viruses associated with the
outbreaks in NSW were detected; all viruses detected were V4 vaccine virus
or V4-like viruses, genetically remote from virulent ND virus.
Subsequently, birds on 5 remaining premises in Western Sydney from which
virulent ND had previously been isolated were destroyed in early 2001.
Six months after this stamping-out response had been completed, Australia
was able to meet international standards for being free of virulent ND, and
this status was regained in October 2001. An ongoing ND vaccination program
is in place in the Sydney and Tamworth areas as a risk management measure.
Until this latest incident in Victoria, there had been no outbreaks of ND
or isolations of virulent ND virus in Australia since February 2000.

Newcastle disease A160: update
------------------------------
A total of 182 000 poultry at the poultry layer (egg production) enterprise
near the town of Meredith, Victoria have been destroyed. See above for
further details of the enterprise and diagnostic methods used.
The causal agent is virulent Newcastle disease (ND) virus of Australian
origin (amino acid sequence of F cleavage site RRQRRF and a 9 amino acid
extension at the HN gene, indicating that the virus is identical, or almost
identical, to the 1999 Mangrove Mountain isolate of virulent ND virus of
Australian origin; ICPI 1.61).
The mode of introduction to the farm remains unknown. There has been no
evidence of spread of Newcastle disease from the infected property.
Stamping out on the one infected farm is continuing. At close of business
23 May 2002 around 182 000 of an estimated 250 000 birds had been
destroyed, with the balance due to be completed by 25 May 2002. Cleaning
and disinfection operations will then start. All surveillance has been
negative. This includes the small number of poultry flocks within the 10 km
CA (surveillance zone), the few in-contact farms, and other poultry flocks
in Victoria and the rest of Australia. Victorian authorities have begun
issuing permits for voluntary vaccination of Victorian poultry flocks as
part of a risk minimisation strategy for ND. The rest of Victoria and
Australia outside of the CA remains free of ND.
No additional quarantine or movement restrictions have been imposed by
other Australian States and Territories, beyond those imposed by Victorian
authorities.
