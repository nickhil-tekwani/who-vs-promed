[The CCHF virus is tickborne and can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. High mortality rates are observed only if there are hemorrhagic manifestations of the disease; in general, up to 80 per cent of infections are asymptomatic (Vorou R, Pierroutsakos IN, Maltezou HC. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. Curr Opin Infect Dis. 2007; 20(5): 495-500; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17762783).

The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter.

The above report does not elaborate on the occupational or exposure history of the patients. However, the majority of cases have been reported in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, butchers, veterinarians and on account of exposure in health care facilities among health care workers who are in contact with suspected CCHF cases.

The health and veterinary (including entomologists/vector control) sectors need to work together on formulating awareness messages to reach the susceptible groups in the general public, especially the high risk groups, in order minimize exposures. - Mod.UBA
