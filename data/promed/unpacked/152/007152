A warning has been issued following a surge in people being bitten and scratched by flying foxes infected with a virus like rabies. A spike in the number of incidents in the Newcastle area has led New South Wales health experts to issue a bat attack alert. The extremely hot weather seen across Australia this is week is making the bats irritated and aggressive, the ABC reported.

Authorities say the number of bites and scratches is unprecedented, with public health physician David Durrheim telling ABC News: "The 7 [cases] that we have had in the last 2 weeks is certainly higher than we've seen in comparative periods." Dr. Durrheim is advising people in the region to avoid all contact with the animals, and to assume all bats carry the rabies-like virus Australian bat lyssavirus.

The public health doctor said the risks that come with being attacked by a bat should not be underestimated. "The clinical symptoms are almost just as awful as rabies, and once the disease starts it can't really be effectively treated, and almost everyone dies," Dr. Durrheim said.

According to Dr. Durrheim, the flying foxes can also take ill in the hot weather conditions and fall from trees, becoming entwined in wires or other places. People who try to assist them will then end up getting scratched or bitten.

[Australian bat lyssavirus is a potentially lethal zoonotic virus. It was 1st identified in 1996 and has been found in several species of flying foxes and bats in Australia. A few human deaths have been reported due to this virus, generally associated with history of contact with flying foxes or other bats.

Flying foxes belong to the genus _Pteropus_, and they are the largest bats in the world. There are several species.

Education of the public to avoid manipulating bats may prove an effective preventative measure.
