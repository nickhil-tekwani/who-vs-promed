Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: introduction of new live animals; legal movement of animals; fomites (humans, vehicles, feed, etc); airborne spread.

Epidemiological comments: 1st case in Rodrigues was on 7 Jul 2016 and treated as an isolated case. Since there was a continuous increase in the number of cases, blood samples were collected and analysed at the Animal Health Laboratory at Reduit, in Mauritius. 1st positive FMD diagnosis was done by competitive ELISA. Another positive diagnosis from cattle in Mauritius was on 5 Aug 2016 by competitive ELISA. Confirmation from Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute (OVI) in South Africa is awaited. The French Food Security Agency (ANSES) has confirmed FMD virus by PCR and virus isolation; serotype O has been confirmed by antigen detection ELISA on viral isolate.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, disinfection/disinfestations, traceability, quarantine, surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; stamping out; official destruction of animals products; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; zoning; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: vaccination in response to the outbreak(s)

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type/ Species / Test / Test date / Result
French Food Security Agency (ANSES), France (OIE reference laboratory) / Cattle / antigen (Ag) detection ELISA / 13 Aug 2016 / Positive

[This immediate notification complements the information published in ProMED posting 20160816.4419978.

According to the epidemiological comments, the "1st case in Rodrigues was on 7 Jul 2016 and treated as an isolated case. Since there was a continuous increase in the number of cases, blood samples were collected and analysed at the Animal Health Laboratory at Reduit, in Mauritius. 1st positive FMD diagnosis was done by competitive ELISA. Another positive diagnosis from cattle in Mauritius was on 5 Aug 2016 by competitive ELISA. Confirmation from Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute (OVI) in South Africa is awaited. The French Food Security Agency (ANSES) has confirmed FMD virus by PCR and virus isolation; serotype O has been confirmed by antigen detection ELISA on viral isolate."

It will be of interest to know if the samples taken in the Rodrigues' outbreaks were taken only from cattle or if they also included the other susceptible species involved in the outbreaks. Having information on the exact number of susceptible animals, the number of cases, and the number of deaths as well as any further details on the vaccine used would be also useful. - Mod.CRD
