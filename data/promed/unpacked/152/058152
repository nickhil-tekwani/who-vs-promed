Indonesia: Incidence of Chikungunya Fever during 2003
-----------------------------------------------------
Chikungunya fever with symptoms like pain in muscles and feet, [causing]
difficulty in rising for a week, attacked 8068 people in 29
regencies/cities in 9 provinces of Indonesia during 2003.
"While this type of fever is actually not fatal, it affects the
productivity of the sufferer," Minister of Health Achmad Sujudi said in
Jakarta on Mon 16 Feb 2004. He said chikungunya fever, which was first
found in Yogyakarta in 1973, has symptoms similar to those of dengue fever,
which is spread by _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes. "The
only difference is that if a dengue fever sufferer is not immediately
treated, by the administration of certain drugs and lowering of his or her
body temperature substantially, the person may die, whereas a chikungunya
fever patient will automatically recover and be cured after a week of the
attack," he said.
The minister has issued an instruction to regency/city administrations to
take prompt action to eradicate the disease by destroying the breeding
places of the mosquito vector especially during the rainy season, thereby
preventing outbreaks of chikungunya fever, dengue fever, and malaria. "The
9 provinces which were the first to be attacked by chikungunya fever in
2003 include Central Java, Yogyakarta, Banten, West Java, East Java, Bali,
West Nusas Tenggara, East Nusa Tenggara, and Lampung," he said.
The most effective measures to prevent a chikungunya fever outbreak include
a thorough cleaning, and often change of the water of one's bathroom pool
in which [the insecticide Abate] should be poured, proper covers for water
storage containers, burying objects or goods which are no longer in use,
and filling in pools of water after the rain not to give mosquitoes a
chance to lay eggs and breed, he said.

[In Asia the main vector of chikungunya virus appears to be _Aedes
aegypti_, but there may be others. The identities of the species of
mosquito involved in the transmission of chikungunya virus in Asia and
elsewhere have been discussed in more detail in preceding ProMED-mail posts
