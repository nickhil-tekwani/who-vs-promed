The La Crosse County Health Department issued an alert about the death of 3 pet cats since July [2016] in the city of La Crosse [due] to tularemia, a zoonotic bacterial disease that can be spread between animals and humans.

Tularemia is transmitted to people and other animals through tick bites and biting flies or contact with infected rabbits and rodents, said Dave Geske, the county's vector control manager. Although human infection after contact with infected cats has been well documented, tularemia is not transmitted person to person, Geske said. The 3 cats had been allowed to run outside, where they probably fed on an infected rabbit or rodent or an infected tick bit them, he said.

Signs of tularemia infection of a cat include cough, difficulty breathing, skin sores or ulcers, poor appetite, weight loss, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, swollen lymph nodes and lethargy.

In humans, the onset of tularemia typically is sudden and similar to the flu, with high fever, chills, fatigue, general body ache, headache and nausea. Most often, it develops as a skin ulcer where the bacteria entered, along with swelling of the regional lymph nodes, Geske said.

[Tularemia is caused by the Gram negative bacterium _Francisella tularensis_. Tularemia is largely confined to the northern hemisphere and is not normally found in the tropics or the southern hemisphere.

_Francisella tularensis subsp. tularensis_ (Type A) is associated with lagomorphs (rabbits and hares) in North America. It is transmitted primarily by ticks and biting flies, is highly virulent for humans and domestic rabbits.

In addition to vector transmission, tularemia may be spread by contact with infected animals or environmental fomites by inhalation, or by ingestion of the poorly cooked flesh of infected animals or contaminated water. - Mod.PMB
