PRION DISEASE UPDATE 2008 (06)
******************************
A ProMED-mail post

[With the continuing decline of the number of
cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease --
abbreviated previously as vCJD or CJD (new var.)
in ProMED-mail -- in the human population, it has
been decided to broaden the scope of the
occasional ProMED mail reports to include other
prion-related diseases. Data on vCJD cases from
any part of the world are now included in these
updates where appropriate, and other forms of CJD
-- sporadic, iatrogenic, familial, and GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease) -- are
included also when they have some relevance to
the incidence and etiology of vCJD. - Mod.CP]

Monthly Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease statistics as of 2 May 2008
-------------------------------------------------------------
These following figures show the number of
suspect cases of CJ referred to the
CJDsurveillance unit in Edinburgh and the number
of deaths of definite and probable variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated in
ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD], the form
of the disease thought to be linked to BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy).

Definite and probable vCJD cases in the UK as of 7 Apr 2008
-----------------------------------------------------------
Summary of vCJD cases - deaths
------------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 115
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 48
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 0
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 163

Summary of vCJD cases - alive
-----------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 3

Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 166

These data indicate that there have been no new
cases diagnosed during the past month, and the
number of patients alive is unchanged.

These data are consistent with the view that the
vCJD outbreak in the UK is in decline (although
the incidence curve may be developing a tail).
The peak number of deaths was 28 in the year
2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in
2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in 2007, and so far none in 2008.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the year 2008
--------------------------------------------------
As of 2 May 2008 in the UK, so far there have
been 42 referrals, 23 deaths from sporadic CJD, 2
deaths from iatrogenic CJD, none from familial
CJD, 2 from GSS, and none from vCJD.

This document lists the numbers of confirmed and
probable cases of all forms of CJD recorded in
France from 1992 t0 2008. The original text
should be consulted for a full breakdown of the
figures. During that period there were 23 cases
of vCJD, all now deceased. They occurred between
1996 and 2007: one case in 1996, one case in
2000, one case in 2001, 3 cases in 2002, none in
2003, 2 cases in 2004, 6 cases in 2005, 6 cases
in 2006, 3 cases 2007 and none so far in 2008.
There were 12 male and 11 female patients.

Their ages at time of death ranged from 19 to 58
years (mean 39). Six of the patients resided in
the Ile-de-France, and 17 in the provinces. All
the cases were met-met homozygotes for codon 129
of the prion protein gene. No special risk
factors were evident which distinguished these
patients from those with other forms of CJD
(sporadic, genetic, iatrogenic). However one
patient had visited the UK at regular intervals.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the year 2008
--------------------------------------------------
As of 30 Apr 2008 in France, so far in 2008 there
have been 524 referrals, 10 deaths from sporadic
CJD, one death from iatrogenic CJD, one from
familial CJD, none from GSS, and none from vCJD.

Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease reported in Spain in 2007 and 2008
--------------------------------------------------------------------
In 2005, the 1st case of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) was reported in
Spain, in a woman born in 1978 with clinical
onset of symptoms in 2004 [1]. She subsequently died in 2005.

Recently, 2 more laboratory-confirmed vCJD cases
were reported to the Spanish CJD state registry.
In February 2006, a woman born in 1957 developed
progressive cognitive deterioration, and died in
December 2007 with suspected sporadic CJD
(typical EEG in October 2007) MM at codon 129 and
no mutations in PRPN gene. A man born in 1967 had
onset in May 2007 with psychiatric symptoms, and
after several months developed progressive
cognitive decline with dementia, typical MRI, MM
at codon 129, no mutations in PRPN gene. He died
in February 2008. Post-mortem, neuropathology
with histochemistry confirmed vCJD in both cases.
No clear specific dietary habits, blood donations
or reception were recorded. Neither case appears
to have visited the United Kingdom before 2004.

The latest 2 cases were resident in the same
region of the country, Castilla y Leon, but no
link between them was established.

[4] UK: SEAC Annual Report 2007
Date: Apr 2008

Committee (SEAC): Annual Report 2007 [abbreviated and edited]
<http://www.seac.gov.uk/publicats/annualreport2007.pdf>


SEAC Annual Report 2007
-----------------------
Foreword
--------
The continued decline in the incidence of Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in the United
Kingdom (UK) and elsewhere in Europe is very
welcome. As a result, the European Union (EU) has
been able to relax some of the control measures
introduced to protect human and animal health,
and is considering further relaxations.

Whilst there are clear economic benefits to
relaxing controls, the associated risks may be
less well understood. During 2007, SEAC provided
advice on the risks that may be associated with
changes to specific controls, and advice on how
these risks can be assessed. As the effectiveness
of one control may be related to that of others,
it is important that regulators consider the
impact of specific changes, and combinations of
changes, on the effectiveness of the control
regime as a whole. Furthermore, it is vital that
surveillance of animals and humans is in place
that is capable of detecting any major adverse
consequences of changes to the control regime
should these arise. The recent identification of
different, albeit apparently rare, forms of BSE,
which were discussed by SEAC during the year,
emphasises the need for continued vigilance.

It is highly likely that sheep were exposed to
BSE during the BSE epidemic in cattle. However,
despite extensive Transmissible Spongiform
Encephalopathy (TSE) surveillance in sheep there
is no evidence that BSE is present in the UK
sheep flock now. *{The relatively recent
identification of atypical scrapie and paucity of
experimental data about its transmissibility
either between sheep or to humans have raised
concerns about the possible animal and public
health implications of this disease}*. Although
atypical scrapie has been identified in a number
of EU Member States, no clusters of cases have
been found. It is, therefore, considered that
this disease may have a low rate of transmission
between sheep. It is possible, therefore, that
atypical scrapie, like classical scrapie, may
have existed for some considerable time without
any apparent association with human TSEs.
Nevertheless, the human health implications need
to be clarified. SEAC will continue to monitor
closely the results from research underway to
assess the human and animal health implications of atypical scrapie.

Encouragingly there was only one new diagnosed
case of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD)
in 2007. However, uncertainty remains about the
number of individuals that may be infected with
vCJD but who are not showing clinical signs of
the disease (subclinical infections). It is
critical to ascertain better the prevalence of
subclinical infections. This is because the
assumed presence of these infections is the
reason costly interventions have been introduced
(depletion of white blood cells from blood
donations, deferral of blood recipients from
donating blood and single-use instruments for
certain types of surgery and dentistry) to
minimise the potential risk of human-to-human
transmission of vCJD. During 2007, SEAC reviewed
the analysis of the first tranche of results from
the National Anonymous Tonsil Archive (NATA).
None of the tonsils tested to date (more than 45
000) has been found to be positive for abnormal prion protein.

SEAC Annual Report 2007
-----------------------
Thus, NATA provides no evidence to suggest that a
large epidemic of subclinical infections exists.
However, there is still uncertainty about how
early during the preclinical phase abnormal prion
protein accumulates in tonsil tissue and
therefore, how reliably tonsil testing is able to
detect subclinical infections. It is also the
case that a large proportion of tonsils removed
comes from young people with little or no
likelihood of dietary exposure to BSE. For these
reasons, SEAC continues to stress the need for a
post mortem tissue archive to complement the data
from NATA. Together NATA and a post mortem tissue
archive would allow the wide range of estimated
prevalence of subclinical vCJD infections to be
narrowed, facilitating better risk assessments of
potential human to human transmission of the
disease, and analyses to justify costly current and future interventions.

New risk assessments considered by SEAC during
2007 suggest that, under certain circumstances,
dentistry, like blood transfusion and surgery,
may provide a route for vCJD infection to be
passed between people. Following advice from
SEAC, the Department of Health issued guidance to
dentists in 2007 about making certain types of
dental instruments single use as a precautionary
measure to prevent possible vCJD transmission via
certain dental procedures. SEAC strongly
encourages the work already underway to improve
the decontamination of dental and surgical
instruments and to develop blood tests that will
allow the risks of vCJD transmission to be reduced.

[Byline: Professor Chris Higgins, Chair of SEAC]

SEAC Epidemiology Subgroup Report
---------------------------------
The SEAC Epidemiology Subgroup met on 5 Jul 2007
to review the testing methodology and preliminary
results from NATA. The Subgroup agreed that the
methodology was appropriate, although
uncertainties remain about the ability of tonsil
testing to detect subclinical vCJD. The results
were consistent with previous understanding of
the prevalence of subclinical vCJD. The Subgroup
noted that work is ongoing to establish
additional surveys using post mortem samples from
coroners' autopsies and, provided appropriate
tests become available, donated blood samples.
The Subgroup agreed that these additional surveys
are important as they could provide assurance
about results from NATA and only together do
these and NATA provide data for all age groups of the population.

SEAC Sheep Subgroup Report
--------------------------
The SEAC Sheep Subgroup met on 4 Oct 2007 to consider the following issues:
- The origins of atypical scrapie in a sheep
flock established and managed to minimise the
risk of infection by TSEs and the implications
for research using animals from the flock.
- The interpretation of findings from
experiments to characterise the strain of
infection in 2 historic sheep TSE cases and the
implications for current understanding of the
possible presence of BSE in sheep.
- The implications of early data from a study of
bottle feeding milk from classical scrapie infected ewes to TSE-free lambs.
- The implications for the scientific basis of
the National Scrapie Plan of cases of classical
scrapie in sheep with a genotype previously
considered resistant to classical scrapie.

[Encouraging features of Professor Higgins'
report are that there was only a single diagnosed
case of vGJD in the UK in 2007, and that none of
more than 45 000 tonsil biopsies were found to be
positive for abnormal prion protein. Thus there
is no indication that a large epidemic of
subclinical infections exists in the community. - Mod.CP]
