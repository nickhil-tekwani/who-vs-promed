Mortality event in Porpoises in British Columbia. May, 1997.
Below is a brief description of an ongoing die-off of Dalls and Harbour
porpoises in southern British Columbia, Canada. We are interested in any
information regarding mortalities of other marine species in adjacent
waters or similar experience elsewhere.
In the past 3 weeks, 18 porpoises (slightly more Dalls than Harbour
Porposies) have been found dead in waters off the southern tip of Vancouver
Island and the lower Strait of Georgia. All but two animals were found dead
on beaches. Two were found floating dead off shore. The male:female ratio
is roughly 1:1. One female was pregnant. The estimated age range is 2-4
years old. There exists a very active stranded marine mammal network in
this region. The previous 10 years records indicate that at this time of
year, 3-4 animals would be expected to be recovered. However, a very
similar event in this area (approx. 30 animals over 6 weeks) was recorded 4
years ago.
Four animals have been available for veterinary examination, with 8 more
grossly examined by biologists involved with the stranding network.
Laboratory analyses are pending. The most consistent gross pathological
lesions are largely restricted to the gastrointestinal tract. Signs of
enteritis (distended, sometimes thickened intestines, pathches of
hemorrhage on intestinal serosa, fibrin on serosal and mesenteric surfaces,
red-brown contents of the gastrointestinal tract) have been seen in the 4
animals examined. Large volumes (up to 4 litres) of dark serosanguinous
fluid have been found in the abdominal cavity and (in one case) the
thoracic cavity. Mesenteric lymphatics and blood vessels were prominent.
Some animals have had food in their stomachs. Their general body condition
has been good and parasite load and species not above expected for all
cases. Two animals had signs of trauma; one consistent with an encounter
with a vessel. Others have been too autolyzed or scavenged to make reliable
pathological observations [I'll assume that the autolyzed and traumatized
animals were some of the 8 porpoises examined grossly, not the 4 with GIT
lesions. Mod. pc]. Samples have been submitted for histopathological,
microbiological and toxicological examination.
To date, we have no evidence of mortality in other marine mammals, marine
birds or fishes in this area. No known toxic events (algae blooms) or
spills have been reported or uncovered. The untreated sewage from a
relatively large urban center is depositied offshore via a pipeline in the
waters where the majority of these animals were recovered.
We look forward to your input. [A similar event occurred off the coast of
Florida in March and April of 1996, with 158 Manatees involved. This has
been ostensibly attributed to "red tide" and cold weather forcing a
concentration of manatees into the toxic area. - Mod. pc]
