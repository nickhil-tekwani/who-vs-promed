Post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) is an enigmatic
emerging disease of early-weaned swine that is manifesting in epidemic
and endemic forms in major pig-producing countries around the world.
Although clearly and consistently associated with porcine circovirus 2
(PCV2) infection, PMWS cannot be reproduced by inoculation of PCV2
alone. In fact PCV2 is a common and usually non-pathogenic virus on
pig farms. So what are the co-factors that allow PCV2 to become
pathogenic and manifest as PMWS?
Evidence is now accumulating that pathogenic PCV2 infection may result
from an overwhelming challenge to the immune system when pigs are
weaned early (e.g., 3-4 weeks of age).
Under typical intensive farming conditions, weaning is a time when the
young pig's immune system faces challenge from a variety of novel
infectious agents as a result of moving to rearing accommodation
combined with mixing with other pigs. Porcine reproductive and
respiratory disease syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine parvovirus
(PPV) infections are often experienced, though mostly sub-clinically,
in the weeks following weaning. Experimentally, PRRSV and PPV have
induced PMWS in pigs inoculated with PCV2, in circumstances where
PCV2 inoculation alone was ineffective.
Research just published in the November (vol.48) edition of "The Pig
Journal" (organ of the UK Pig Veterinary Society) draws attention to
another possible co-factor of the emergence of this devastating
disease -- the growing use over the last few years of a multiplicity
of vaccines in young pigs. The hypothesis is that powerful antigenic
challenges from modern vaccines may, in some situations, contribute to
an "overwhelming" of the early-weaned pig's immune system. To test
this hypothesis, the authors withdrew a _Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae_
vaccination programme from approximately 50% of the piglets born over
a 4 months period. In non-vaccinated animals, losses due to PMWS were
reduced in 4 out of 5 groups studied.
Another paper in the same journal reports on a case-control study of
PMWS in which risk factors for the disease included large farm size
and more numerous breeding stock introductions. So it may be that a
variety of management factors that have increased in recent years, as
a response to economic pressures and price competition, may be
becoming counter-productive.
