Salmonella outbreak linked to pet bearded dragons
-----------------------------------------------------
Fast facts
---------
Illnesses: 44
Hospitalizations: 15
Deaths: 0
States: 25
Investigation status: active

CDC and public health officials in several states are collecting different types of data to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Uganda infections. Epidemiologic and laboratory data show that contact with bearded dragons is making people sick.

Epidemiologic data
------------------
As of 10 Jan 2022, a total of 44 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Uganda have been reported from 25 states (see map at https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/uganda-01-22/map.html). Illnesses started on dates ranging from 24 Dec 2020 to 2 Dec 2021 (see timeline at https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/uganda-01-22/epi.html).

Sick people range in age from younger than 1 to 84 years, with a median age of 27, and 8 ill people were children under the age of 5. Of 43 people with sex information, 27 (63%) are female. Of 37 people with information available, 15 (41%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

The true number of sick people in an outbreak is likely much higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because many people recover without medical care and are not tested for _Salmonella_. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it usually takes 2-4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

State and local public health officials are interviewing people about the animals they came into contact with in the week before they got sick. Of 33 people interviewed, 21 (64%) reported owning or touching bearded dragons or their supplies. People reported getting their bearded dragons from various places, including pet stores and online.

Laboratory data
--------------
Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. CDC PulseNet manages a national database of DNA fingerprints of bacteria that cause gastrointestinal illnesses. DNA fingerprinting is performed on bacteria using a method called whole-genome sequencing (WGS). WGS showed that bacteria from sick people's samples are closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak likely became sick from contact with the same type of animal.

On 19 Nov 2021, Oregon Health Authority collected samples from a bearded dragon in a sick person's home for testing. WGS showed that the _Salmonella_ from the animal is closely related to bacteria from sick people. This means that people likely got sick from touching bearded dragons.

Whole-genome sequencing of bacteria from 44 people's samples and one bearded dragon sample did not predict any antimicrobial resistance. Standard antibacterial susceptibility testing of 2 people's samples by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory also found no resistance. Most people with salmonellosis recover without therapy.

Public health actions
-------------------
CDC advises that you always take steps to stay healthy around your pet bearded dragon:
- Wash your hands.
- Don't kiss or snuggle your bearded dragon.
- Don't eat or drink around it.
- Keep it out of the kitchen.
- Keep its supplies and habitat clean.

[Salmonellosis can be acquired from a variety of lizards, including these bearded dragons, snakes, turtles, and iguanas. Appropriate hand hygiene is necessary to minimize this risk.

_Pogona_ (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogona) is a genus of reptiles containing 8 species, which are often known by the common name bearded dragons. The term "bearded dragon" is most commonly used to describe the central bearded dragon, (_Pogona vitticeps_). Members of this genus live in the arid, rocky, semi-desert regions, and dry open woodlands of Australia. They are adept climbers, spending time on branches and in bushes and near human habitation.

_Pogona_ species bask on rocks and exposed branches in the mornings and afternoons. They are found throughout Australia. Several species of this genus, especially the central bearded dragon, are often kept as pets or exhibited in zoos due to their hardy nature and easy care in comparison to other exotic reptiles.
