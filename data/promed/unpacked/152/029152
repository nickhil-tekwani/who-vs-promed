NEWS RELEASE: Texas Animal Health Commission [edited]
First Case of Animal Anthrax in 2003
Confirmed near Del Rio; Producers in Area Urged to Vaccinate Livestock
Laboratory tests completed in early August have confirmed that a
white-tailed deer near Del Rio died from anthrax.. This is the first
confirmed case of the disease in Texas in 2003. "It's not unusual to have
a few cases of anthrax in livestock or deer each year in Texas, and
usually, they occur in a triangle bounded by Uvalde, Ozona, and Eagle Pass,
which takes in portions of Crockett, Val Verde, Sutton, Edwards, Kinney,
Uvalde, and Maverick counties," said Dr. Bob Hillman, state veterinarian
and executive director for the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC), the
state's livestock health regulatory agency.
In early July, counties around Del Rio received rains spawned by Hurricane
Claudette as the storm moved westward over land. The welcome moisture was
followed by a normal hot, dry spell.
Dr. Hillman explained that the TAHC has 2 main concerns about anthrax
cases. The first is to ensure that potentially exposed or incubating
animals are not moved from the premises. "We don't want animals to die in
transit or on a new premise and then be mishandled," said Dr. Hillman.
"Therefore, our regulations require that animals on an infected premises be
quarantined for at least 10 days after all the livestock have been
vaccinated against the disease. This period of time allows for any
perviously exposed animals to die from the disease, while healthy animals
will develop immunity, thanks to the vaccine."
"Ranchers with livestock in areas where anthrax cases usually occur either
vaccinate routinely each spring, or begin vaccinating their cattle, sheep,
goats, horses or other grazing animals as soon as a season's first case is
reported," he said. "Although the injected vaccine is very effective,
unfortunately there is no approved method for administering vaccine to
free-ranging deer, which can't be rounded up and restrained in a chute for
vaccination."
"Our second concern about anthrax is the proper disposal of infected
carcasses," Dr. Hillman noted. He pointed out that, prior to release of a
TAHC quarantine, carcasses of infected animals must be burned thoroughly.
"Carcasses of animals that have died of anthrax should not be opened, and
to avoid bacterial contamination of the soil, carcasses, animal bedding,
and nearby manure must be burned, and the surrounding soil must be scorched
to kill the bacteria, using gasoline or wood as fuel," he said. He advised
producers not to burn oils, diesel, or tires, as these products create air
pollution. Dr. Hillman said proper carcass disposal also prevents wild
pigs, coyotes, dogs, or other predators from dragging carcasses (and the
anthrax bacteria) from one pasture to another. [More importantly, if the
carcasses are not opened by scavengers or in necropsy, normal decomposition
will soon result in the death of the vegetative cells, which cannot
sporulate without oxygen. The low pH during anaerobic decomposition quickly
kills the vegetative cells. - Mod.MHJ]
"When burning potentially infected carcasses, ranchers should wear shirts
with long sleeves and put on gloves to avoid contaminating sores or
scratches on their arms or hands," cautioned Dr. Hillman. "Skin anthrax can
cause a nasty sore that requires appropriate antibiotic treatment from a
physician, so practice good general sanitiation practices. Wash your hands
and clothes. Consider disinfecting equipment used to move bedding,
potentially infected manure, or fuel. Keep pets away from carcasses, and
avoid picking up bones, horns, or antlers from dead animals. Healthy
animals should be moved from anthrax-contaminated areas during an outbreak."
"Hunters often ask us about anthrax and risks associated with harvesting
animals," commented Dr. Hillman. "Fortunately, by the time hunting season
starts, cool weather usually puts an end to a season's outbreak. Always
shoot only healthy-looking animals. If a deer has ingested anthrax
bacteria, within hours, it will stagger, tremble, or exhibit convulsions,
and death is inevitable."

[This outbreak involved 2 white-tailed deer in a high-fenced deer ranch.
The carcasses were burnt. So far there are no reports of further cases. The
ranch has had cases in previous years. In late July 2003 I had a call from
the area on some 10 deer that had died on a different ranch. The related
tissue sample demonstrated only a pure Pseudomonas infection, which I
gather is not unknown in deer. The continuing rain in the area should limit
any further cases, as it will wash off the contaminated blowfly feces
deposited on scrub bushes near affected carcasses; this is a
long-recognised phenomenon terminating outbreaks in such endemically
affected places such as the Kruger National Park. White-tailed deer are
primarily browsers. In the Kruger the major host is kudu, also browsers. As
the rainfall in this part of Texas increases from west to east, it may also
explain why the disease stays at the western end of the Edwards Plateau. -
