Unknown disease damaging wheat crops
------------------------------------
A disease not yet identified has affected wheat crops in Beaufort County [North Carolina, NC], due to excessive rain and overall wet field conditions. Though farmers and agriculture officials originally believed the problem to be _Soil-borne wheat mosaic virus_, they have since found that not to be the case. Affected wheat samples have been sent for diagnosis at NC State University. It is unknown how the disease will affect yields and profits from this year's [2016] wheat crop.

_Soil-borne wheat mosaic virus_, a virus that was previously believed to be a problem across many areas of the state, not only has been ruled out in Beaufort County, but other damage previously believed to have been [caused] by the virus, has proved to be attributed to other diseases and problems.

"It's a matter of importance, but not everybody is being affected by this," said Rod Gurganus, Beaufort County Cooperative Extension. "We were thinking we were on to something affecting wheat across the state, but we've found there are different diseases happening in other areas. This problem is not the same as in other areas."

The disease is reducing the number of tillers, which can potentially have a huge effect on yield. "(The disease) is basically causing the wheat to be stunted and some of the growth to die," Gurganus said. Crops across Beaufort County have been negatively affected by an excess amount of rain and a lack of cold weather. "A lot of crops were standing in water, and that's when the problems started showing up. It's not everywhere, but on certain farms, it's widespread. It's bad [but] at this point, there's nothing that can be done."

[A large number of diseases due to fungi and other pathogens can affect wheat. The wet conditions described above would favour many of them and also increase the risk of simultaneous infections by multiple pathogens, which can lead to severe yield losses. In addition, the humidity would also increase the risk of wheat stored after harvest to be affected by pathogens and pests adding to yield losses and decreasing the grain quality.

_Soil-borne wheat mosaic virus_ (SBWMV; type species of genus _Furovirus_) was first described from the USA in the 1920s. It occurs in various parts of the world and can also affect triticale. SBWMV causes one of the few diseases of winter wheat that can destroy an entire crop of a susceptible cultivar. Yield loss depends on virus strain, crop variety and environmental conditions. Symptoms vary and may include mild green to prominent yellow leaf mottling, rosetting, and moderate to severe stunting of plants. SBWMV is transmitted by the soil-inhabiting fungus _Polymyxa graminis_. The virus can survive for several years in soil and dry crop residues, protected by the fungus. It is spread with contaminated soil, by water and mechanical means, but is not seed-transmitted. Disease management relies mainly on use of resistant crop cultivars.

The report above illustrates the importance of molecular diagnosis for plant diseases, since similar symptoms can be due to different pathogens as well as effects of external factors on the host. Symptom expression may also be influenced by, for example, host and/or pathogen strains and environmental conditions.
