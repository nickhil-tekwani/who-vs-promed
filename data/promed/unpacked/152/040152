A total of 30 people died in Myanmar out of 3000
infected with dengue fever [DF] in the first half
of this year [2007], higher than that of the same
period of 2006, local media reported Sunday [8 Jul 2007].
The health authorities have warned the public to
take precaution against DF especially during the
current monsoon season which started last month
[Jun 2007], said the Myanmar Times in its next
weekly issue (9-15 Jul [2007]). The highest
number of the DF cases occurred in southern Mon
state, followed by Yangon and Ayeyawaddy
divisions during the half-year period, the report said.
According to statistics, 11 049 people were
infected with DF in the country resulting in 130
deaths in 2006. Dengue fever cases once dropped
in Yangon city in 2006 thanks to preventive
measures taken against the disease. The dengue
fever cases in Yangon declined to 1531 with 18
deaths in 2006 from 5621 cases with 40 deaths in 2005.
The dengue fever cases were attributed to heavy
population [density] and poor stream-water flow
in some areas in the 680-square-kilometer Yangon
which has a population of 6 million.
The health authorities have occasionally advised
people to take necessary measures to prevent and
control the disease, including hygienic use of
drinking water, combating larvae, week-end
sanitation activities and education talks on the
dengue fever, which is being spread by a species
of mosquito active during the day.
According to official statistics, nearly 13 000
dengue fever cases occurred in Myanmar in 2005, a
sharp increase from the previous year's 6000. The
figures represented the second biggest outbreak
of the mosquito-borne viral disease since 2001
when it was reported as 15 695. Of the 6000
dengue fever cases reported during 2004, nearly
half were also in Yangon, especially in the
Southeastern area of Thaketa, according to the health department.
The authorities warned that the _Aedes_ mosquito
carrying the virus put residents in heavily
populated areas at increased risk of contracting
the disease than other urban areas, adding that
there is no specific treatment or vaccine for the
dengue fever. Dengue fever usually breaks out
during and after the rainy season and children
aged under 12 are particularly vulnerable to the disease.
[Having] broken out in Myanmar intermittently,
the dengue fever was first detected in Yangon in
1969 and a major outbreak of the disease followed
in 1970, which was confined in Yangon until 1973.
The first case in northern Mandalay division was
detected in 1974 and major outbreaks had occurred
in the division about every 4 years with most recent in 2001 and 2005.

additional water supplies in and immediately

Impoverished Cambodia is appealing for
international help to fight a major outbreak of
dengue fever, which has killed more children
early in this year's [2007] wet season than in all of the last.
"Dengue is hitting almost all provinces
nationwide. We cannot contain the virus with our
limited resources," Ngan Chanta, head of the
country's anti-dengue programme, said on Thursday
[28 Jun 2007]. "We need foreign help" to counter
an outbreak that has killed 138 of the 12 700
children the mosquito-borne virus has infected this year, he said.
The virus, which generally strikes during the
June-September wet season and in Cambodia appears
to hit mostly children, killed 116 of the 12 300
who caught it last year. Cambodia, still
recovering from decades of civil war and the
"Killing Fields" of the Khmer Rouge, needed 500
000 [USA dollars] swiftly to buy larvicides for
use on mosquito breeding grounds, Ngan Chanta said.
Lam Eng Hour said the 4 Swiss-funded hospitals of
which he is deputy director were being swamped by
dengue sufferers the facilities treat free. "We
just cannot manage if more and more patients come," he said.
The hospitals had appealed for 7 million [USA
dollars] from donors, he said, to fight a disease
that has reached epidemic proportions in wealthy
Singapore as well as striking hard in neighbouring Thailand and in Malaysia.
Lam Eng Hour said many children died of dengue
because the hospitals were short of blood for
transfusions, and he praised foreign tourists who
had responded to appeals by donating blood "They
are being more than just tourists, they are
saving our childrens' lives," he said.
Cambodia's public health system remains
rudimentary, with much of its funding coming from
foreign aid. According to the World Bank, annual
government spending on health is about 3 [USA dollars] per person.

Vietnam's health minister has raised concerns
about a spreading dengue outbreak, citing 27
deaths this year and a jump in the number of
cases, a newspaper reported on Saturday [7 Jul 2007].
"The risk of the dengue epidemic outbreak in
southern and central provinces is very high in
the coming time," Health Minister Tran Thi Trung
Chien told the Thanh Nien (Young People)
newspaper. She said the focus to fight dengue was
to eliminate areas where mosquitoes breed.
The Health Ministry has also sought government
approval to include dengue prevention in a
national programme that targets social, dangerous
diseases along with HIV/AIDS for the period until 2010, Chien said.
There is no treatment for dengue, which is
transmitted by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito. The
infection rate has accelerated in recent years
due to increasing urbanisation and travel or
migration within the region, experts say.
Dengue infected 24 255 Vietnamese in the first
half of this year [2007], up 23 percent from a
year earlier: 19 000 of them live in southern provinces, Chien said.

The tropical viral fever has killed 27 people,
compared with 17 deaths from the fever in the first half of 2006.

Health centers in the Mekong Delta are overloaded
with dengue fever patients as some provinces have
registered upwards of 200 cases a week over the
past few months [May - Jun 2007].
Since the beginning of the year [2007], Dong Thap
province has seen over 3000 dengue cases while
neighboring provinces like Kien Giang and An
Giang have been hit with 2350 and 2200 cases,
respectively. Phu Quoc island's district hospital
has received 20-30 dengue patients a day over the past few weeks.
Additionally, health agencies in central Vietnam
have reported several dengue fever outbreaks
recently. The disease has struck 27 percent more
people this year [2007] than over the same period in 2006.

In Malaysia, 1044 cases [of dengue fever] were
reported last week [week of 24 June 2007],
topping the 1000 mark for the 2nd time in a
month, signalling an epidemic, the New Straits Times said.
The disease has so far claimed 56 lives in
Malaysia, compared with 46 deaths in the first half of 2006.
In Indonesia, where concerns over bird flu more
frequently grab headlines, dengue saw a dramatic
peak earlier this year [2007] after much of the Jakarta area was flooded.
By May [2007], there had been 68 636 cases and
748 deaths, according to Health Ministry data.

The Ministry of Heath confirmed on Friday [6 Jul
2007] the 1st indigenous case of dengue
hemorrhagic fever in Taiwan this year. A
68-year-old woman from Tainan in southern Taiwan
is now in a stable condition after treatment.
Numerous cases of dengue fever, which is
transmitted by mosquitoes, are reported in Taiwan
each year. The hemorrhagic variation of the
disease can be particularly life threatening if
patients do not receive quick treatment.
The Department of Health also said that a further
14 cases of indigenous dengue fever have been
reported in the same district in Tainan.

Unconfirmed reports say [a man], [age] 22, a
Borivli resident, died of dengue on Thursday [5
Jul 2007]. He was admitted to the Karuna Hospital
in Borivli. He also suffered from brain
haemorrhage. However, he remained non-comittal.
He said the hospital would seek a 2nd opinion on
whether the death was because of dengue.
Meanwhile, at least 254 new cases with
monsoon-related diseases were admitted to
municipal hospitals in the last 24 hours. In the
last 5 days [2-6 Jul 2007], the civic hospitals
reported 815 cases of monsoon-related diseases.
Officials from the health department said 205 of
these were discharged after treatment. [The
number of dengue infections among these cases is not specified. - Mod.TY]
Medical practitioners projected a further rise in
such cases after 9 Jul [2007]. According to Dr.
SN Acharya, the incubation period for the virus
is usually 7 - 10 days after the 1st spell of rains.

Palau's Ministry of Health reports there are now
14 confirmed cases of dengue fever. The Bureau of
Public Health Director, Stevenson Kuartei, says
there are 36 suspected cases of dengue, bringing the total figure to 50.
Mr. Kuartei says the Avian Flu Task Force, which
has been earlier asked by President Tommy
Remengesau to address the dengue outbreak, has
met to discuss the problem. The Task Force is
mobilising the community to conduct an
island-wide cleanup that will focus on getting rid of mosquito breeding sites.

Dengue fever is running rampant in Costa Rica,
prompting a coordinated effort by the Ministry of
Public Health and other government agencies to calm the onslaught.
During the first 6 months of the year [2007],
Health Ministry statistics indicate there have
been 6870 cases of patients with dengue
countrywide, exactly double the 3435 cases
reported during the same period last year.
The epidemic, which raged in 2005, resulting in
over 37 000 people infected, settled down to a
more manageable level in 2006 but seems to be swelling again this year.
According to Dr. Henry Wasserman, of the Health
Ministry, the virus came on strong in the
northwestern Guanacaste province early in the
year, but has since settled to normal levels
there. Limon, in the Caribbean, is now the most
seriously affected province, with 856 confirmed
cases thus far this year [2007].
Doctors at Limon's Tony Facio Hospital report
that more than 40 beds are occupied by dengue
patients, putting excessive pressure on the
hospital's resources and ability to handle patients with other ailments.
To date, 70 people have been infected with the
more serious hemorrhagic dengue, which can result
in death. Investigations are ongoing, but the
Health Ministry suspects 3 people have died after
being inflicted with the more serious dengue this year.

Reports of dengue cases in Honduras has markedly
increased over the weekend [30 Jun - 1 Jul 2007],
with about 5000 people infected from the classic
strain, and over 200 by dengue hemorrhagic fever,
health authorities revealed Saturday [7 Jul
2007]. The disease keeps spreading alarmingly,
and in the last 7 days, hemorrhagic cases
amounted to 221, and classic ones to 4737, Health
Minister Jenny Meza disclosed.
The number of people infected with the 2 types of
the virus so far this year [2007] almost doubled
that of the same period last year, according to Meza.
Meanwhile, it was revealed this morning that new
health facilities will be fitted out in the
capital to cope with the huge number of patients.
The Honduran health ministry reported 2 people
have died of the dengue hemorrhagic fever so far.

In the 1st semester of 2007, the state [Sao
Paulo] had 52 566 [dengue] cases, a number
greater than the 51 566 registered in the entire
year of 2006. The number of deaths from DHF (14)
is now the same as in 2006. At least 90 of the
645 Sao Paulo municipalities are faced with epidemics.
The number of registered [dengue] cases now will
[likely] exceed the historical record of 2001,
when 51 668 persons contracted the disease.
The Secretary of Health of the state has
attributed this record [number of dengue cases]
to 3 factors: high temperatures coupled with
rains during the 1st months of the year; an
epidemic [of dengue] in the [state of] Mato
Grosso do Sul, which adjoins Sao Paulo; and
greater circulation of [dengue] virus type 3,
which causes greater dengue symptoms, and consequently, more reported cases.
According to the Superintendent of Endemic
Control, Afonso Viviani Junior, the [downward]
trend in recent weeks is due to 2 climatic
factors (dry and cold season). "This has reduced
the vector mosquito population significantly."

The efficiency of the country's battle with
dengue worsens. In the 1st 4 months of this year
(2007), the number of cases of this disease
increased 20 percent in relation to the same
period in 2006. There have been 246 833 [in 2007]
of which 288 developed DHF and 38 died -- a
number between 10 and 15 per cent greater than in
the same period of of last year (2006). Concerned
about this increase, a group of consultants from
the Pan American Health Organization came to
Brazil in July [2007] to analyze with local
consultants the plan to combat dengue.
According to Fabiano Pimenta (acting Secretary of
Surveillance, Ministry of Health), the increase
in cases has been due to 2 factors: an increase
in the intensity and duration of rains, and an
explosion of cases in Mato Grosso do Sul [state]
-- 68 000 cases just this year (2007). "In the
state there have been a large number of
[mosquito] breeding sites and the population was
not resistant [immune? - Mod.TY] to dengue virus 3," he observed.
He also noted, however, that in other localities,
where the population is also susceptible to
dengue [virus] 3, the epidemic was
contained. This was the case in [the state of]
Minas Gerais. "This is an example of how, with
good field work and the collaboration of the
population, it is possible to avoid an explosion
in the number of cases." he affirmed.

[An economic assessment of the cost of dealing
with a dengue epidemic versus the cost of a
sustained dengue control program (vector control)
would be of considerable interest. The challenge
is financing control when there have been no, or few, cases in past years.
