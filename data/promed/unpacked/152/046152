India (Manipur) - mystery ailment kills 7: request for information
------------------------------------------------------------------
A supposedly mysterious disease has caused 7 deaths in a border area
without doctors has set alarm bells ringing in the Manipur capital. Health
minister P Parijat Singh today despatched a medical team to Moreh,
bordering Myanmar, to detect the disease that has spread quickly in the
villages along the boundary over the past week [1-6 Oct 2007]. The
additional director of public health, Th Biren Singh, said the state health
directorate received an SOS from Chandel district yesterday [6 Oct 2007].
Patients suffering from the disease have complained of high fever, stomach
pain, and vomiting. Health department officials said some of the victims
had convulsions and seizures before they died. The directorate is still
clueless what the killer ailment is since the symptoms are common to
several diseases, including gastroenteritis, cholera, dysentery, and acute
stomach infection.
We have received preliminary information of some deaths in the border town
in the past few days. We sent a medical team there today and will do
everything necessary to contain the outbreak, the health minister said,
ruling out the possibility of the disease assuming epidemic proportions.
The first death occurred on 28 Sep 2007 and the last on 5 Oct 2007. We are
preparing to send another batch of medical staff once we receive a detailed
report. We will also send in specialists, Biren Singh said. He said blood
samples of patients would be collected and tested to identify the disease
type. The disease could have been triggered by contaminated water. We are
in the process of finding the exact cause, the health minister said.
Moreh, the main trade link between India and Myanmar, has only one primary
health care centre, which was upgraded to a community health centre earlier
this year. A couple of months later, the community health centre was
shifted to Sugnu in neighbouring Thoubal district, as the state government
planned to construct a 50 bed hospital in the town. The medical staff at
the health centre were also moved to Thoubal along with the new recruits,
rendering the Moreh unit defunct.
Acknowledging that healthcare programmes had failed in the border town
because of lack of adequate manpower, Parijat Singh said the government
would soon deploy trained personnel at the health centre.

[The description of this "mysterious disease" is insufficiently specific or
consistent to suggest a probable explanation. Contagion, inadequate water
supply and defective waste disposal, or inadequate health care facilities
could be responsible for this incident. The predominant feature appears to
be gastrointestinal illness, but the occurrence of convulsions and seizures
preceding the deaths of a few patients might be indicative of the
occurrence of some more unusual disease such as Nipah virus infection,
which has been reported elsewhere in the north east of India in recent
times. Further information from any informed source in the region would be
welcomed.
