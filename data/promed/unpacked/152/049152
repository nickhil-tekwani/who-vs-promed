Summary
-------
No confirmed cases were reported in the week to 29 Nov 2015. Investigations are ongoing into the origin of infection of the cluster of 3 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) reported from Liberia in the week to 22 Nov 2015. The 1st-reported case in that cluster was a 15-year-old boy who tested positive for EVD after admission to a health facility in the Greater Monrovia area on 19 Nov 2015. He was then transferred to an Ebola treatment centre along with the 5 other members of his family; 2 other members of the family -- the boy's 8-year old brother and his 40-year-old father -- subsequently tested positive for EVD whilst in isolation. The 15-year-old boy died on 23 Nov 2015. In addition to the family of the 1st-reported case, 165 contacts have been identified so far, including 34 high-risk contacts. Liberia was previously declared free of Ebola transmission on 3 Sep 2015. ... - more

[2] Duration of Ebola virus RNA persistence in semen
Date: Thu 3 Dec 2015
Source: Eggo R, Watson C, Camacho A, Kucharski A, Funk S, Edmunds W. Duration of Ebola virus RNA persistence in semen of survivors: population-level estimates and projections. Euro Surveill. 2015;20(48):pii=30083. DOI:BB http://dx.doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2015.20.48.30083

Abstract
--------
Ebola virus can persist in semen after recovery, potentially for months, which may impact the duration of enhanced surveillance required after interruption of transmission. We combined recent data on viral RNA persistence with weekly disease incidence to estimate the current number of semen-positive men in affected West African countries. We find the number is low, and since few reported sexual transmission events have occurred, the future risk is also likely low, although sexual health promotion remains critical.

In this study, a negative binomial distribution is fitted to recent data on persistence of Ebola virus (EBOV) RNA in semen after Ebola virus disease (EVD) symptom onset in EVD survivors. Given the prior reported incidence of EVD in each affected region of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, the fitted distribution is used to estimate and model the number of men in these countries with EBOV RNA present in semen, in each week since mid-2014. According to this, the total number of EBOV RNA semen-positive individuals in January 2016 would be low (n=73; 95 percent confidence interval (CI): 15-331). Since few reported sexual transmission events have been documented [1], the future risk of such transmission is also likely low.

28 Nov 2015 USA (TX): North Texas ER patient tested for 'Ebola-like symptoms'
http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/ER-Patient-Shows-Ebola-Like-Symptoms-357424541.html
[A Veterans Administration [VA] North Texas Emergency Department patient with symptoms similar to Ebola virus disease [EVD] was seen at the facility's Emergency Department (ED) on Saturday afternoon [28 Nov 2015]. The facility activated its Serious Infectious Threat Response protocol. According to Froy Garza, VA North Texas spokesperson, they consulted with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for an initial assessment, which showed the patient was at an extremely low risk for Ebola virus disease (EVD). The patient was subsequently placed in isolation. As a precaution, the facility plans to transfer the patient to a designated EVD assessment facility.]

Prevention
----------
29 Nov 2015 Guinea: Guinea's last Ebola case, a baby girl, leaves hospital
http://in.reuters.com/article/2015/11/28/us-health-ebola-guinea-idINKBN0TH0PB20151128
[Guinea's last-reported Ebola virus disease (EVD) case, a 1-month-old baby girl, left the hospital on Saturday, 28 Nov 2015. The infant's mother died shortly after delivery of the infant secondary to blood loss. The infant, "N," is thought to be the 1st infant to survive after being born to an EVD-infected mother. It is thought that "N," who was born EVD-positive, was able to survive due to experimental drugs and 24-hour-care given by a 20-member team.

"N" received Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc's Ebola drug ZMapp and an experimental anti-viral drug known as GS-5734 being developed by the US drug maker Gilead Sciences.

Guinea will be declared "Ebola free" if there are no new cases over the next 42 days.]

29 Nov 2015 Liberia: In newest Ebola outbreak, quarantine is not strictly enforced
http://www.bushchicken.com/in-newest-ebola-outbreak-quarantine-is-not-strictly-enforced/
[13 households from 9 homes within the affected Cow Field community in Paynesville are currently quarantined in the newest Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak. However, the quarantine is not being strictly enforced and the EVD-quarantined area is not effectively restricted. Motorcyclists, vehicles and visitors were seen moving in and out of the isolated area. It also was not clear which individuals were quarantined.

At one point, a reporter was already interacting with a person from the community when a community-based Initiative worker told him the person was being quarantined and should not be close to others. The Ministry has not directly used the term "quarantined," yet volunteers at the scene explicitly described it using the term "quarantined."

According to information obtained from the affected Cow Field area, the quarantined individuals were instructed by health authorities not to speak to, or be photographed by, any journalist.

According to an anonymous source within the Ministry, the Ministry is avoiding calling the containment a "quarantine" and has avoided placing barricades -- as the Ministry did during the height of an earlier EVD outbreak -- in an attempt to avoid frightening its residents.]

29 Nov 2015 UK (England): suspected Ebola patients turned away from regional hospital due to bed shortages
http://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/Ebola-patients-turned-away-regional-hospital-bed/story-28263650-detail/story.html
[2 patients suspected to be suffering from Ebola have been turned away from a regional hospital (East Yorkshire Hospital) because of a shortage of beds. Both of the patients were showing Ebola symptoms when turned away. Public Health England (PHE) designated Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust as a regional assessment area during the height of the outbreak in West Africa because of its expertise in treating infectious diseases. 1 of the patients was diverted to Leeds, and the 2nd patient was treated in the emergency department of York District General Hospital after Leeds also ran out of beds. According to Dr Peter Moss, director of infection prevention and control, when speaking to trust board members, "Unfortunately, on the 2 occasions on which the trust was asked by PHE to take a patient, there was no bed available."]

3 Dec 2015 Liberia: Ministry of Education mandates schools to reinstitute Ebola safety protocol

[The Ministry of Education has directed school administrators and teachers in the country to reinstitute temperature monitoring system teams and hand-washing stations at school entries "in full observance of the School Safety Protocol."]

1 Dec 2015 Rwanda: reinstates Ebola checks after Liberia reports new cases
http://allafrica.com/stories/201512011156.html
[Because of Liberia's reemergence of Ebola virus disease (EVD), Rwanda's Ministry of Health (MOH) has issued a public notice reestablishing required mandatory self-reporting for anyone staying in Rwanda for up to 22 days after leaving an Ebola-affected country. The MOH further indicated measures against noncompliance would be taken. According to Nathan Mugume, the director of communications at the MOH, travelers from these countries are expected to either report online once a day before 4pm to provide updates on their health status or immediately call a health hotline to report unusual clinical symptoms.]

28 Nov 2015 Guinea: US government changes its advice on trips in Guinea
http://www.drumconnection.com/2015/11/28/ebola-the-us-government-changes-its-advice-on-trips-in-guinea/
[Because Guinea is now in the 42-day period towards being declared free from Ebola virus disease (EVD), the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) no longer recommends US residents avoid "non-essential travel" to Guinea. However, the CDC advises US travelers to Guinea to avoid contact with blood or body fluids. The CDC said "Travelers should also be aware that obtaining medical care in Guinea to be difficult because the health infrastructure was severely affected by the Ebola outbreak," and advises postponing traveling by certain categories of travelers (such as the elderly or people with weakened immune systems).]

Research

2 Dec 2015: Ebola study ties viral blood levels to death rate
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2015/12/ebola-study-ties-viral-blood-levels-death-rate
[Researchers cautioned that the findings might not reflect Ebola cases outside of hospital settings. They said, however, that awareness of the relationship between viremia and CFR [case fatality rate] could help clinicians more accurately gauge the effects of Ebola treatments in nonrandomized trial settings. They also noted that stratifying Ebola patients by viremia could help researchers reduce study sample sizes for randomized trials by 25 percent.]

Blood donation

2 Dec 2015 USA: Recommendations for assessment of blood donor suitability, donor deferral and blood product management in response to Ebola virus: Draft Guidance for Industry
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/Blood/UCM475072.pdf
[The US Food and Drug Administration is proposing new guidelines for screening people who are donating blood to help fight the Ebola virus. The draft guidance issued Wednesday [2 Dec 2015] addresses "blood donor suitability, donor deferral and blood product management in response to Ebola." The public has 90 days to comment on the recommendations.]

Vaccine
-------
1 Dec 2015: A compensation system for vaccine injuries is needed for diseases such as Ebola
http://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-12-compensation-vaccine-injuries-diseases-ebola.html
[According to Amir Attaran and Kumanan Wilson of the University of Ottawa, Ontario, a Canada in a Policy Forum article published this week in PLOS Medicine, a part of a comprehensive plan to facilitate a more rapid vaccine development for diseases such as Ebola requires a plan to lessen the risks of litigation and liability, and ensure recipients of vaccines are fairly compensated in the rare occasions they are harmed. A compensation system for vaccine injuries, on a no-fault basis and probably overseen by the World Bank, could represent a solution to this problem.

1 Dec 2015: Blood levels of Ebola virus are predictive of death
http://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-12-blood-ebola-virus-death.html
[According to a study published in PLOS Medicine, viremia in Ebola virus disease (EVD) patients was a strong predictor of death that partly explained variations in case fatality ratios (CFR) in the study population.
