Delhi on High Alert to Combat Dengue
------------------------------------
Delhi civic authorities have kicked into high gear following 8 cases
of dengue fever being reported from different parts of the capital. As a
part of its alert, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) has launched
several measures, including cleanliness drives and awareness programmes, to
minimise the possibility of a dengue fever outbreak in the state. "We are
basically looking for community participation, educating people to keep
their environs clean," K N Tiwari, municipal health officer, told Indo-Asian
News Service. "The _Aedes_ mosquitoes, which carries the dengue virus, breed
in congested and unhygienic conditions. We are reducing the breeding surface
in polluted localities and resident welfare associations have been formed."
"We have hired workers who have removed tyre dumps and other refuge that
provide a breeding ground for _Aedes_ mosquitoes. Nodal officers have been
appointed in government buildings to keep a check," he said. In 1996, 145
people had died in a dengue/DHF epidemic and more than 10 000 were infected in
Delhi.
Apart from the 8 reported cases, fears that people suffering from the
disease might come in to the capital for treatment have heightened the
concerns of the authorities. Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh are
reeling under an outbreak of dengue, the official said. The MCD has sent men
and machines to combat dengue in Rajasthan. "The situation in Rajasthan is
very bad. The state government had requested us for help. We have sent 25
thermal fogging machines and some manpower to help the people," Tiwari said.
