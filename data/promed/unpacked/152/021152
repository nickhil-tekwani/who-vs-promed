Health clinic patients possibly exposed to hepatitis, HIV
---------------------------------------------------------
A contaminated IV [intravenous] line is being blamed for a patient
contracting hepatitis C [virus] at a health clinic in San Pedro,
California. Officials are urging patients of the Advanced Pain Treatment
and Medical Center who were treated between 16 Jan 2006 and 18 Aug 2010 to
get tested for hepatitis B [virus], hepatitis C [virus], and HIV [human
immunodeficiency virus] infection.

An unidentified nurse is believed to have contaminated the IV line that was
improperly administered. The nurse, who is no longer administering IVs, is
still working at the clinic. A 2nd case, involving a patient contracting
hepatitis B [virus], has also been linked to the clinic.

ProMED-mail rapporteur Brent Barrett

[Bloodborne infections as a result of medical malpractice are fortunately
rare. This news report does not reveal the nature of risk associated with
IV treatment at the Advanced Pain Treatment and Medical Center, which
appears to have spanned a period in excess of 3 years. Nor is revealed how
many, if any, patients became infected by hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C
virus, and/or HIV.

San Pedro is located in Los Angeles County, California (see map at
