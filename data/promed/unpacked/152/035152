Leishmaniasis is an endemic disease in many regions of Spain. It is caused by the parasite _Leishmania_ spp ., a protozoan that is most commonly transmitted by the bite of sandflies infected with the parasite. The disease has various forms, ranging from cutaneous leishmaniasis [CL), which causes skin sores, to visceral leishmaniasis [VL], which affects internal organs and is usually fatal if left untreated.

In Mediterranean countries, such as Spain, dogs are considered the main reservoir of _Leishmania infantum_ (_L. infantum_), the causative agent of the disease in the national territory. The prevalence of leishmaniasis in dogs in Spain ranges from 2% to 57.1% depending on the geographical region, with Ourense, Lleida, Girona, Cáceres, Valencia, Alicante, Murcia, and almost all of Andalusia being the areas with the highest seroprevalence, in many cases exceeding 17% positive dogs.

In Galicia, data on the seroprevalence of canine leishmaniasis determine a rate of positive dogs between 1.6% and 24.3%. In recent weeks, veterinarians in the northern coastal area of Lugo have warned of an increase in the number of positive animals.

Diario Veterinario interviewed Germán Quintana, from the A Marosa Veterinary Center, with clinics in Viveiro and Burela (Lugo), who states that "in the last 30-60 days we have diagnosed 3 new cases of canine leishmaniasis in the area where previously we had been diagnosing 3-4 cases per year."

In this regard, Quintana explains that "although we cannot conclude that the infection occurred here, the truth is we have the vectors that can allow the appearance of new cases and that is something that worries us."

Taking factors such as climate change and globalization into account, "it seems inevitable that our region will end up joining so many others where cases of canine leishmaniasis are regularly diagnosed," he laments. This, is despite the climatic conditions in the northern region of Lugo, which are "expected to allow a lesser extent [of infection] than in other areas."

The person in charge of the center confirms that the detected leishmaniasis cases are limited to dogs, while "for now", no such cases have been detected in other species, such as ferrets or cats.

Quintana regrets the lack of investment in research, or the "development of new treatments and therapies against these and other diseases", since, as he recalls, "leishmaniasis is considered an emerging zoonotic disease in Spain."

However, he points out that "we should not alarm the population, since the human disease is milder than in dogs. This increase in cases in dogs should serve as an alert signal (sentinel system) for the health authorities, and that they take the appropriate measures to reduce the risk in animals and people, especially in the most vulnerable (immunocompromised, cancer patients...)."

Regarding the causes to that are drawing a new map of leishmaniasis in Spain, the veterinary clinician points mainly to the human factor. On the one hand, climate changes mean that the vectors can settle in regions less favorable for them before. On the other hand, "globalization, expressed in the enhanced movement of people and animals, facilitates the appearance of new outbreaks in previously unaffected areas".

Veterinarians recommend that "every year you should go to the vet to have your dog tested, preferably during the winter season (from December to March). Affected animals can have relapses, so they should undergo regular monitoring and also recurrent treatments if necessary.

Prevention is basic in disease control. It is necessary to prevent insects from biting both carrier and non-carrier animals. Vaccination is indicated to help dogs fight effectively against leishmaniasis in case of contact with the parasite. Today there are vaccines against leishmaniasis. For this reason, vaccination is recommended for all dogs older than 6 months of age that live in endemic areas.

[Europe's leishmaniasis situation has been subject to a recent review in an ECDC technical report, published in June 2022 (citation below). Among the various articles, the report includes separate segments dedicated to individual countries in Europe and in adjacent countries. The paper (59 pages) pays particular attention to the epidemiological changes observed. One of such changes was the spread of cutaneous leishmaniasis northwards, currently present at higher altitudinal ranges in Italy and Spain. Another notable piece of information relates to the origin of dogs found infected in European countries, by _L. infantum_. The majority of such pets involved animals imported from various endemic regions, or with travel history to countries in the southern part of the European Union (mostly Spain, Portugal, Greece, and Italy).

In Morocco, Spain's southern neighbor, the incidence of VL in humans "gradually decreased from 0.51 in 2005-2008 to 0.26 in 2013-2016, and was 0.27 in 2017-20. In contrast, CL incidence fluctuated, and was lowest (7.90) in 2013-2016 and highest (17.05) in 2017-2020."

The country reports of Spain, Portugal, and Spain's southern neighbor, Morocco, addressing humans and animals, are available on pages 26-27, 27-28, and 30-32, respectively.

The report's conclusions are: "Leishmaniases remain widespread and underreported in many countries of southern Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East. There is a need to improve leishmaniasis prevention and control based on robust surveillance in humans, animals, and vectors, and to increase public awareness following a 'One-Health' approach. Current leishmaniasis prevention and control measures and access to valid diagnostic methods and effective treatments are insufficient. This could have important disease implications including an increase in incidence in the EU and its neighbouring countries; the spread of _Leishmania_ spp. into new areas going unnoticed; increases in treatment failure and the development of resistance to treatments."
