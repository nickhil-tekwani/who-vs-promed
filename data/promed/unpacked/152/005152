A senior prosecutor in [Nantou County] said Thu 21 Jul 2011, 4 of the
5 people who died suddenly between 6 and 8 Jul 2011 in the county may
have been killed by botulism toxin. In the initial forensics tests,
traces of botulism toxin were found in 4 of the bodies, but it was not
certain whether the toxins were from eating homemade vegetable
preserves, said Chu Kun-mao, chief of the Nantou District Prosecutors
Office.

It will require further microbiology tests by Department of Health
agencies to confirm the results, he said. The Institute of Forensic
Medicine will deliver the final report on the causes of death after
the results of the microbiology tests become available 26 Jul 2011,
the prosecutor said.

On 6 Jul 2011, 4 residents of Hsinyi Township in Nantou died
suddenly. It was found that the people, a vegetable farmer, his wife,
and their 2 helpers, had shared a meal earlier in the day. 2 days
later, another Hsinyi resident died suddenly from what was initially
thought to be food poisoning, but that was later ruled out.

Amid fears of an epidemic in the township, the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) reported that the latest victim had died of septicemia
caused by inflammation of the pancreas and cellulitis, according to
prosecutors. The families of people at first suspected murder, but
have since accepted the findings of the experts, prosecutors said.
