Officials say an aggressive fox that bit a middle school girl and 2 preschoolers in Charlotte [Mecklenburg County, North Carolina] earlier this week has tested positive for rabies.

The middle schooler, an 11 year old girl, was watching football practice at Kennedy Middle School around 6:40 pm when she was bitten by the fox, police say. Officers responded to the call and found the aggressive fox under the bleachers. An officer shot the fox with a shotgun after it attacked police as they were attempting to capture it, officials say. The fox's body was taken to be tested for rabies by Animal Care and Control. On Thursday afternoon [1 Oct 2015], Animal Care and Control officials said the rabies tests results from the state lab tested positive for rabies.

According to Animal Care and Control, there have now been 15 confirmed positive cases of rabies in Mecklenburg County in the 1st 9 months of 2015. There have been 9 raccoons, 3 foxes, 2 bats and a skunk that tested positive for rabies.

In addition, officials say an adult reported being scratched at the middle school as he was trying to fend off the fox. "This is kind of an anomaly this would happen. Typically, wildlife as you know are afraid of you," said Melissa Knicely with Animal Care and Control. Officers also believe the fox bit 2 preschoolers earlier in the day at Primrose School of Lake Wylie at Steele Creek, on West Arrowood Road. The Mecklenburg Health Department has confirmed that all exposed victims have been contacted by the Health Department and they have all started post-exposure prevention.

The owner of the school, which is also a daycare, says the attack happened on the playground. Somehow the fox was able to get in between the fence's metal bars. He said the teachers are heroes. "As the fox tried to bite the children, they ended up beating or kicking the fox to get it away from the children after it lunged out at the children," he said. "These are wild animals and that's the main thing about a wild animal, they're unpredictable. When you see a wild animal, keep your distance. So we're using it as a learning opportunity."

Prior to the attacks the fox was napping close to the school; that's unusual. Knicely explained if wildlife is not running away from you, that's a sign something is wrong. "The best thing for you to do is to get you, your pets, get them inside to safety and definitely make a call to report the fact that it's wildlife behaving oddly," Knicely said.

Animal care and control says rabies is in the county and says all pets are required to get a rabies shot after they're 4 months old. Animal care and control provides free rabies vaccinations to Mecklenburg County resident's pets every 2nd Saturday of the month at Animal Care & Control, 8315 Byrum Drive, Charlotte.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg police said an internal investigation is being conducted on the shooting of the animal, which is standard procedure.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools said Wednesday [30 Sep 2015] that all students at the middle school will do outdoor activities, PE and sports practices inside after the incident. The owner of Primrose School said kids won't go back out onto the playground until next week.

[This must have been a frightening experience for the children and the teachers, not to mention the parents, receiving phone calls to say their children had been bitten by a fox while at school/day care and then to learn that the fox was rabid. Post-exposure rabies treatment is clearly in order and hopefully this will calm some of the fears.

While free rabies vaccinations for pets are given every 2nd Saturday, perhaps this should be increased to more than once a month. Furthermore, the veterinarians and health officials should be encouraging these rabies shots for all pets. - Mod.TG

Events highlight the impact of rabies on people, pets and wildlife
------------------------------------------------------------------
USDA is honored to host the 26th Rabies in the Americas conference in Fort Collins, Colorado, which begins on Sunday 4 Oct 2015.

What do raccoons, vampire bats, and mongooses have in common? All are wildlife species that are commonly associated with rabies and can potentially expose people, pets and livestock to the deadly virus.

The significant impact of rabies on public and animal health will be the focus of the 26th Rabies in the Americas conference in Fort Collins, Colorado, on [4-8 Oct 2015]. This is the 1st time this important international conference will be held in Colorado and be hosted by APHIS [Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service], according to Richard Chipman, coordinator for APHIS-Wildlife Services' (WS) National Rabies Management Program.

The annual meeting typically includes 300 attendees from more than 20 countries across 5 continents. It provides an opportunity for researchers, health professionals, rabies program managers, wildlife biologists, laboratory personnel, and other people interested in advancing knowledge about rabies surveillance, prevention and control, to meet, share their successes, and discuss challenges.

Dr Kurt VerCauteren, a research wildlife biologist at WS' National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC) and member of the conference planning committee, says that, as a scientist, he looks forward to discussing new ideas, strategies and tools for controlling rabies with his international colleagues. Dr VerCauteren notes the agenda includes talks from renowned rabies experts on diagnostic technologies, economics, human rabies prophylaxis, vaccine developments, outbreak response plans, and epidemiology, as well as domestic and wild animal research.
