Respiratory virus outbreak contained at Mac's neonatal ICU unit
---------------------------------------------------------------
Hamilton health officials have declared an outbreak at McMaster hospital's
neonatal intensive care unit after 3 newborns became ill with a respiratory
virus. The premature babies were confirmed to have parainfluenza type 3
virus infection. It is a seasonal virus associated with respiratory
symptoms such as a cough and fever. There have been no new cases since
then, according to hospital officials. The neonatal intensive care unit,
which has 44 babies, remains open to visitors and patient admissions and
the 3 affected babies are in isolation and being monitored closely. All are
recovering, said hospital spokesperson Lillian Badzioch.

The virus is not a flu virus and not associated with the H1N1 swine flu
virus that is spreading in the community, according to Dr Chris Mackie,
Hamilton associate medical officer of health. Mackie said although
parainfluenza type 3 virus doesn't carry the same risks as regular seasonal
influenzas, it does pose a risk for preemies [babies born prematurely].
Most cases do not require treatment and the virus is commonly seen in
infants during spring and summer months. It can mimic the symptoms of the
flu, Mackie said.

Badzioch said, "It is very common in children under 2." But, she added,
because it is in an intensive care unit and because the babies are all
preemies, the hospital declared the outbreak and erred on the side of
caution to prevent further spread. "We're already dealing with a fragile
population and we wanted to take all the precautions."

The hospital confirmed the cases on Saturday [27 Jun 2009], declared the
outbreak on Monday and informed parents of babies in the unit, but only
notified the general public yesterday [Thu 2 Jul 2009]. "If this was a
serious disease with any risk to the public, this (declaring an outbreak)
would have happened right away," Mackie said. "We don't expect any further
cases."

[The 1st parainfluenza virus discovered was Sendai virus (parainfluenza
virus type 1) in 1952 in Japan. In 1955 type 2 was isolated from children
with acute laryngotracheobronchitis (croup). In 1985 type 3 was isolated
from children with respiratory tract infection. In 1960 type 4 was isolated
from children with mild respiratory tract infections. The human
parainfluenza viruses are pathogens that primarily affect young children,
in whom the pathogenic spectrum includes upper and lower respiratory tract
infections. The human parainfluenza viruses are responsible for 30-40 per
cent of all acute respiratory tract infections in infants and children.
These conditions include common cold with fever, croup, bronchiolitis, and
pneumonia. They are also a cause of community-acquired respiratory tract
infections of variable severity in adults.

Human parainfluenza virus type 3 is 2nd only to respiratory syncytial virus
as a cause of pneumonia and bronchiolitis in infants and young children.
Outbreaks of HPIV-3 infections occur yearly, mainly in spring and summer,
and last longer than outbreaks of the other types of parainfluenza virus.

Reinfection with human parainfluenza viruses can occur throughout life,
with elderly and immunocompromised persons being at a greater risk of
serious complications of infections.
