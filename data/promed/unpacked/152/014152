The WHO said Wednesday, 28 May 2014, that at least 2 Cameroonians had recently died as a result of a cholera outbreak in the far north of the country. At least 50 cases registered in the Far North Region are now receiving treatment, WHO Coordinator Fannh Mahamat told Anadolu Agency. According to Mahamat, the cholera cases were discovered in the border areas of Mogode, Bourha, Mokolo and Goulfe, all of which are located some 30 km from Nigeria. The 1st 3 cases of cholera were detected in Goulfe on 26 Apr 2014, involving a family from Nigeria's Adamawa State who crossed the border for treatment in Cameroon. It is from there that the epidemic is believed to have begun," she said.

Over the past few years, Cameroon has experienced several cholera outbreaks. Cholera was blamed for 100 deaths in the country in 2004 and 51 in 2009. In 2010, there were 10 759 confirmed cases of cholera, of which 657 were fatal. The most recent outbreak -- which featured 16 804 infections and 636 deaths -- happened in 2011, according to official figures.

Bloemhof in the North West could be facing a cholera outbreak, 5 schools in the area have been shut, and thousands of pupils and residents are affected. At Boitumelong township, clinics are swamped with patients with violent diarrhea and symptoms pointing to cholera. The latest outbreak could be caused by untreated waste flowing into the Vaal River. At a private medical clinic, 90 percent of the patients have diarrhea, and medication is fast running out. Communities living around Bloemhof and downstream from the Vaal are warned not to drink the water.

The Health Department has taken water samples to test for cholera.
