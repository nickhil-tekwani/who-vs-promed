*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Introduction of new live animals
Epidemiological comments: A farm was detected in Guanajuato within the framework of the permanent National program for active epidemiological surveillance. It initially had 1400 Rhode Island Red chickens, before the introduction of 500 white chickens towards the end of the laying phase, supposedly coming from a farm in Jalisco where vaccination is applied. This was verified through serology on 30 sera with 2 titers of 1:256, 4 titers of 1:512 and 24 titers of 1:1024. This introduction is considered to be the source of infection of the susceptible birds. Isolation in Querétaro was obtained after the reporting by an authorized laboratory, which provided the official laboratory with the samples. As difficulties were faced during typing of the virus, several diagnostic assays were performed until confirmation. Isolated viruses in Guanajuato and Querétaro presented an IVIP of 2.84 and 2.86, respectively. In both cases, measures to control the epidemic were applied, including quarantine of the premises and killing of the birds. Preemptively, a focal zone and a perifocal zone of 3 and 10 km, respectively were implemented, where the absence of the disease has been verified. The National veterinary services will keep the epidemiological surveillance going and inform the OIE about any evolution.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, screening, quarantine, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, stamping out, zoning, disinfection, vaccination prohibited, no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type:
SENASICA Level 3 Biosecurity Laboratory (National laboratory)

Birds / intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) test / 19 Feb 2018 / Positive
Birds / neuraminidase inhibition assay / 3 Mar 2018 / Positive
Birds / virus isolation / 19 Feb 2018 / Positive
Birds / virus sequencing / 23 Feb 2018 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[This case clearly shows that while vaccinating birds can offer protection from disease, it does not always offer protection against infection. The vaccinated birds were carriers of the highly pathogenic virus, and when introduced into a naïve flock, the circulating virus infected the birds causing significant mortality. It is, therefore, critically important that when the use of vaccination is being contemplated to control spread of the disease, that authorities maintain strict control of its use, strict control on the movement of vaccinated birds, and have an exit strategy to terminate its use. - Mod.CRD
