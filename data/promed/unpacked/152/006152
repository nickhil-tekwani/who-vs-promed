Food poisoning downs 70 in N. Cotabato
--------------------------------------
A total of 70 lumad [indigenous residents] have been brought to the
hospital due to food poisoning after eating wild yam, a social
welfare officer said. The victims were from the hinterlands of
Arakan, President Roxas and Tulunan towns, said Virgilita Guillaran,
provincial social welfare officer.

The good news, however, is that none of the victims died, Guillaran
said. "The figure of indigenous people who got ill from eating wild
yam, was based on the consolidated report submitted to our office by
the social welfare officers of these towns," Guillaran said.

Eric Raz, of the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples in North
Cotabato, said he heard that 4 persons had been poisoned by kayos,
but not 70 as reported.

Guillaran said the devastation wrought by the El Nino phenomenon was
so grave that the indigenous communities have been finding it hard to
secure food, forcing them to eat wild yam or kayos.

As this developed, the provincial government announced the release of
PHP 10 million [USD 221 983] for the purchase of rice for
distribution to communities heavily affected by the dry spell.
Governor Jesus Sacdalan said the amount was enough to buy 8000 sacks
of NFA [National Food Authority] rice, which social welfare officials
would distribute to 18 towns, where food was said to be scarce.
Sacdalan said based on figures validated by social welfare officials,
91 000 families have been affected by the dry spell in the province.
He said some 9000 hectares of rice and corn farms were destroyed. The
total damage, Sacdalan said, reached PHP 200 million [USD 4 439 518].

Meanwhile, the Sangguniang Panlungsod (SP, city council) of Kidapawan
approved on Thursday the release of a PHP 7.5-million [USD 166 482]
fund, which represented the 5 percent calamity fund, to help farmers
affected by the dry spell.

Vice Mayor Joseph Evangelista said the city council authorized Mayor
Rodolfo Gantuangco to use the fund to purchase rice and corn seeds
for distribution to farmers in the city's 40 villages.

[Wild yam (_Dioscorea hispida_ Dennst.), also known in some areas as
'nami,' 'kayos,' 'kuyot,' and 'kurot,' is a close relative of better
known yam varieties such as 'ubi' and 'tugui.' It thrives well under
adverse environmental conditions and grows abundantly in most
Philippine forests and hillsides.

This wild yam is not the same as what many of us know as yams or
sweet potato which is _Ipomoea batatas_.

However, wild yam contains dioscorine, a known alkaloid causing
central nervous system depression. The alkaloid is similar in action
to picrotoxin. Hence, for human consumption proper detoxification of
this root crop is required. Researchers of the Leyte State University
(LSU) in Baybay, Leyte developed 2 methods of wild yam detoxification
a reduced time and cost.

The traditional method involves soaking it in water with sawdust for
several days.

This wild yam is not the same as the cassava root _ Manihot
esculenta_. This plant contains a cyanogenic glucoside. Pictures of
the plant and the root may be found at:
