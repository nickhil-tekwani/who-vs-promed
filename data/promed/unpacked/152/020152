Seasonal Outbreak of Japanese Encephalitis in Nepal
---------------------------------------------------
DAMAK: An epidemic of Japanese encephalitis [is occurring in the Nepal
plain. So far, 25 cases have been admitted to the Damak AMDA Hospital
since the beginning of this month [July 2001. The patients originate
from the Jhapa & Morang Districts. One patient has died and another
18 remain confined to hospital. 70% of the cases are under 15 years of
age. The [Central Government has already been informed.
[Epidemics of Japanese encephalitis have been reported also from
other parts of Nepal. As laboratory testing is not possible except in
the capital, Kathmandu, diagnosis is primarily done by history,
clinical findings, [suddeness of onset and seasonal factors. CSF
examination is possible at most of the Zonal [regional? hospitals.
Every year an epidemic of Japanese encephalitis occurs between July
and October, and rural people are the most affected. Accumulation of
water in rice fields and ponds, as well as improper sewage disposal,
fuel such epidemics at this time of year [they are breeding sites for
the vector Culex mosquitoes, _C. vishnui_ complex & _C.
tritaeniorhynchus_. - Mod.JW. Extremes of age carry a very bad
prognosis.
