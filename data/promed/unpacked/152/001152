Roughly half of 1276 adult COVID-19 survivors in Wuhan, China, still had at least one symptom -- with one-third still reporting shortness of breath -- a year after their release from the hospital, finds a single-center study yesterday [26 Aug 2021] in The Lancet (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01755-4/fulltext).

Led by researchers at Capital Medical University in Beijing, the study involved evaluating and interviewing COVID-19 survivors 6 and 12 months after symptom onset (7 Jan 2020 to 29 May 2020). Median age was 59 years, 53% were men, and median follow-up time was 185 days for the 1st visit and 349 for the 2nd. A matched control group included 3383 adults never infected with SARS-CoV-2.

At 6 months, 68% of patients still had at least one persistent COVID-19 symptom (e.g., sleep problems, heart palpitations, joint pain, chest pain), falling to 49% at 12 months. But the proportion of patients with shortness of breath rose slightly over that period, from 26% to 30%.

Also, more patients reported anxiety or depression at 12 months than at 6 months (26% vs 23%). Six-minute walk test results weren't significantly different at the 2 visits. At 12 months, 3 patients had had an ischemic stroke, and one had developed stable angina pectoris (chest pain due to coronary artery disease).

At 6 months, 353 study participants received a chest computed tomography (CT) scan, with 52.7% showing lung abnormalities. Among the 118 patients who completed a 12-month scan, the proportion of patients with abnormalities fell substantially across all groups but remained high, especially in those who had been the most critically ill (87%).

Relative to men, women had an odds ratio (OR) of 1.43 for fatigue or muscle weakness, 2.00 for anxiety or depression, and 2.97 for impaired lung diffusion (the result of a reduction in lung perfusion and alveolar-capillary membrane conductance). Increasing age was positively associated with higher risk of anxiety or depression (OR, 1.18) and impaired diffusion (OR, 1.30), especially among those with the most severe acute illness.

At 12 months, hospitalized COVID-19 patients reported more problems with mobility, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression and had more prevalent symptoms than control patients. Corticosteroid treatment during the acute illness was linked to increased risk of fatigue or muscle weakness (OR, 1.51), while intravenous immunoglobulin treatment lowered that risk (OR, 0.65).

Among 479 patients who were employed before they had COVID-19, 88% had returned to their work at 12 months, 76% of them at the same level of work. Of the 12% who didn't return to their work, 32% cited decreased physical function, 25% said they were unwilling to do the same work, and 18% because they were receiving unemployment benefits.

Of the 1252 COVID-19 patients who reported healthcare usage and work status at 12 months, 18% had visited an outpatient clinic, and 13% were hospitalized, but none were admitted to an intensive care unit. Eleven patients visited the rehabilitation department, and 5 took part in the professional rehabilitation program to address physical dysfunction.

The authors noted that COVID-19 survivors' health status was lower than that of the control group at 6 and 12 months. "We found that most patients had a good physical and functional recovery during follow-up, and the majority of study participants who were employed before COVID-19 had returned to their original work," they wrote. "However, sequelae symptoms, lung diffusion impairment, and radiographic abnormalities persisted to 12 months in some patients, especially in patients who were critically ill during hospital stay."

In a Lancet news release, senior author Bin Cao, MD, of the National Center for Respiratory Medicine at the China-Japan Friendship Hospital, said that the study has important implications for COVID-19 patient care. "Our findings suggest that recovery for some patients will take longer than one year, and this should be taken into account when planning delivery of healthcare services post-pandemic," he said (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/926526).

In a commentary, the Lancet editorial board said that the study highlights the need for more robust health services for COVID-19 long-haulers (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01900-0/fulltext). "First, only 0.4% of patients with COVID-19 said that they had participated in a professional rehabilitation programme," they wrote. "The reason for such low use of rehabilitation services is unclear, but poor recognition of long COVID and lack of clear referral pathways have been common problems worldwide."

Second, they said, research is urgently needed on the mental health effects of long-haul COVID-19 and persistent symptoms in other patient groups, such as those not admitted to a hospital, younger age-groups, and racial minorities and other disadvantaged groups disproportionately affected by the pandemic.

"The scientific and medical communities must collaborate to explore the mechanism and pathogenesis of long COVID, estimate the global and regional disease burdens, better delineate who is most at risk, understand how vaccines might affect the condition, and find effective treatments via randomised controlled trials," the board wrote.

[While the Lancet study focused on hospitalized COVID-19 patients, other, albeit smaller, studies have shown that COVID-19 symptoms may linger in around 20% of those who get infected but don't get sick enough to go to the hospital.

That means the issue of persistent COVID-19 symptoms looms over any post-COVID-19 public health plan; currently, there isn't much clarity about whether, or how much, insurers will cover rehabilitation for these patients. And that's if patients know of and can access these services to begin with. "It's the tip of the iceberg of enormous potential inequity and disparities in health," says [David Putrino, director of rehabilitation innovation at Mount Sinai Health Systems who oversees the network's long COVID rehabilitation program]. "Most persistent symptoms are invisible symptoms, and walking into a doctor's office and saying you have extreme fatigue" -- a symptom many COVID-19 sufferers have reported experiencing months after infection--"[only] gets treated seriously when you're not a member of a historically excluded group. And when you are, in many cases you don't bother to even go to the doctor's office because who is going to believe you?" (https://time.com/6093164/long-covid-19-largest-study/). - Mod.LK]

[2] Scotland: increase in cases
Date: Fri 27 Aug 2021
Source: BBC [edited]
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-58357346


A total of 6835 new cases were reported on Friday [27 Aug 2021] -- more than 1800 above the previous highest figure. This is the 3rd time this week a new record has been set.

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the sharp rise was a "cause for concern" -- but the Scottish government was not currently considering the introduction of a circuit breaker lockdown. However, she stressed the importance of everyone "playing their part" in halting the spread of the virus.

Ms Sturgeon had previously said the country was at a "fragile and pivotal moment" in the pandemic. She said on Friday [27 Aug 2021] that she could not rule anything out, but that no-one wanted to "go backwards" to even limited restrictions.

Ms Sturgeon urged people to get vaccinated, test themselves regularly and "tighten up again" on following the current guidelines. She encouraged people to meet outdoors, avoid crowds, keep a safe distance from others and minimise physical contact. And she added: "I hope we can get through this with all of us behaving sensibly and appropriately."

The daily test positivity rate reported on Friday [27 Aug 2021] was 14.2%, up from 11.5% the previous day [see figure of COVID-19 cases in Scotland at https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/FA50/production/_120308046_confirmedcases27august.png].

A record number of tests had been carried out on Thursday [26 Aug 2021] -- but Ms Sturgeon said that did not entirely explain the increase in case numbers, which have doubled over the last 7 days. "It's important to point out that case numbers are rising across the UK just now, but after a period of slower increases in Scotland the rise here is particularly sharp at the moment," she said.

"That is possibly, at least in part, a reflection of the fact that our schools return earlier, with the increased interactions that come with that. And although vaccination has significantly weakened the link between a high volume of new cases and serious harm to health, it hasn't completely broken that link."

The number of people in hospital with COVID has risen from 312 to 479 over the last week. There have been 4 further deaths, and no change in the number of patients in intensive care, which stands at 47.

Analysis from David Wallace Lockhart, BBC Scotland political correspondent: "We've seen record high figures this week, but the vaccination programme has disrupted the link between catching COVID and ending up in hospital. But if case numbers get too high, even a small proportion of people becoming seriously ill can pose a challenge for the NHS.

"So it's the number of people becoming seriously ill that will now define the path we take. And, crucially, whether restrictions have to come back. The first minister is ruling out the harshest of restrictions -- a circuit-breaker lockdown. She's actually hopeful that we can get through this without any additional measures.

"We're being asked to take voluntary action: meet outdoors, avoid crowds and limit physical contact. But that leaves the public in a slightly strange position -- being asked to not take full advantage of the freedoms we were granted just a few weeks ago.

"Voluntary action now can help avoid more rules in the near future. That's Nicola Sturgeon's message for the weekend."

National clinical director Professor Jason Leitch was asked on BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme about the statistical modelling for case numbers. He said that if the rate doubled again in another 7 days, that would mean nearly 14 000 cases -- unless we were close to a "peak" which was not currently visible.

When the previous record total of new cases -- 5021 -- was reported on Wednesday [25 Aug 2021], Deputy First Minister John Swinney said the rise was partly being fuelled by the return of schools. Scottish schools returned from the summer holidays in mid-August, several weeks earlier than in the rest of the UK. The Scottish Secondary Teachers Association is calling for all secondary school pupils to be vaccinated.

Scottish Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser warned that "heightening the threat of restrictions when our vaccine system has been so successful" would jeopardise the country's recovery from the pandemic. He added: "The Scottish people cannot be kept in this holding pattern of removing and introducing COVID restrictions, particularly when there is no threat of a new variant at this time. The recovery of our NHS and Scotland's economy is at stake. The SNP [Scottish National Party] must give that more consideration now that so many people have been vaccinated."

Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar voiced concerns about the case rate and increase in hospitalisations and said the way we "ramp up" the rollout of the vaccine was crucial. He suggested door-to-door vaccination in areas with a low uptake, along with mobile units at university campuses and high schools.

[3] China (Nanjing): outbreak
Date: Thu 26 Aug 2021 23:56 CST
Source: Global Times [edited]
https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202108/1232610.shtml


The recent COVID-19 outbreak at Nanjing Lukou International Airport triggered by the delta variant was the most severe and caused the most infections in China since the outbreak in Wuhan, Central China's Hubei Province in 2019, according to the National Health Commission (NHC).

Since 2 domestic infections were reported in Nanjing, East China's Jiangsu Province, on 20 Jul 2021, the current resurgence of the domestic outbreak has spread into 16 provinces with 1272 cases, according to media reports. The cases were linked to places such as Nanjing Lukou airport, a chess and poker room in Yangzhou, a city about 100 kilometers [62 mi] from Nanjing, and Zhangjiajie in Central China's Hunan Province.

Nanjing has been reporting zero domestic confirmed cases for 10 days as of Wednesday [25 Aug 2021], and the Nanjing Lukou airport resumed flight services starting from Thursday [26 Aug 2021] morning after it halted all services on 23 Jul 2021.

Also, a group of experts led by the State Council epidemic prevention and control mechanism working team dispatched to Nanjing on 23 Jul 2021 withdrew on Thursday [26 Aug 2021], after they had guided the local epidemic prevention and control work, conducted massive nucleic acid testing and investigated the origins of the outbreak as well as the transmission path, the NHC said.

The outbreak at Nanjing Lukou International Airport was caused by the import of the delta variant strain into China, the NHC said in a statement on Thursday [26 Aug 2021]. In the latest outbreak, two-thirds of the cases were in Jiangsu with 818 infections, and the rest were in Central China's Henan, Hunan and Hubei provinces.

The facts show that the anti-epidemic measures and experiences accumulated since last year [2020] can help confront the delta variant, the NHC said, noting that authorities still need to improve anti-epidemic measures as well as technologies to deal with imported cases and any potential domestic resurgence.

[4] USA (Florida)
[A] Pandemic cases
Date: Wed 25 Aug 2021

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/25/us/florida-covid-deaths.html


More people in Florida are catching the coronavirus, being hospitalized and dying of COVID-19 now than at any previous point in the pandemic, underscoring the perils of limiting public health measures as the delta variant rips through the state.

This week, 227 virus deaths were being reported each day in Florida, on average, as of Tuesday [24 Aug 2021], a record for the state and by far the most in the United States right now. The average for new known cases reached 23 314 a day on the weekend, 30% higher than the state's previous peak in January [2021], according to a New York Times database. Across the country, new deaths have climbed to more than 1000 a day, on average.

And hospitalizations in Florida have almost tripled in the past month, according to federal data, stretching many hospitals to the breaking point. The surge prompted the mayor of Orlando to ask residents to conserve water to limit the strain on the city's supply of liquid oxygen, which is needed both to purify drinking water and to treat COVID-19 patients.

Even as cases continue to surge, with more than 17 200 people hospitalized with the virus across Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has held firm on banning vaccine and mask mandates. Several school districts have gone ahead with mask mandates anyway.

Overall, 52% of Floridians are fully vaccinated, but the figure is less than 30% in some of the state's hardest-hit counties.

On Monday [23 Aug 2021], dozens of doctors and hospital employees in Palm Beach County gathered for an early morning news conference to beseech the unvaccinated to get shots, emphasizing that the surge was overwhelming the health care system and destroying lives. "We are exhausted," said Dr. Rupesh Dharia, an internal medicine specialist. "Our patience and resources are running low."

A growing proportion of the people inundating hospitals and dying in Florida now are coming from younger segments of the population, particularly those ages 40 to 59, which were less vulnerable in earlier waves of the pandemic. The delta variant is spreading among younger people, many who thought they were healthy and did not get vaccinated.

Dr. Chirag Patel, the assistant chief medical officer of UF Health Jacksonville, a hospital system in Northeast Florida, said the patients hospitalized with the virus during this latest surge tended to be younger and had fewer other health issues, but were nearly all unvaccinated. Of those who have died, including patients ranging in age from their 20s to their 40s, more than 90% were not inoculated, Dr. Patel said.

"We've had more patients this time around that have passed away at a younger age with very few if any medical problems," he said. "They simply come in with COVID, and they don't make it out of the hospital."

Two months ago, the number of COVID-19 patients admitted at the system's 2 University of Florida hospitals in Jacksonville was down to 14. On Tuesday [24 Aug 2021] morning, 188 coronavirus patients were in the hospitals, including 56 in the intensive care units.

One of the hardest parts of his job, Dr. Patel said, is having to tell family members that their unvaccinated loved one had succumbed to the virus. "It's just such a senseless and preventable way of ultimately dying," he said.

[B] Death total
Date: Fri 27 Aug 2021 08:59 EDT

https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article253766203.html


Florida on Thursday [26 Aug 2021] reported 21 765 more COVID-19 cases and 901 deaths to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), according to Miami Herald calculations of CDC data.

All but 2 of the newly reported deaths occurred after 25 Jul 2021, with about 78% of those people dying in the past 2 weeks, according to Herald calculations of data published by the CDC. The majority of deaths happened during Florida's latest surge in COVID-19 cases, fueled by the delta variant.

It is the largest single-day increase to the death total in the state's COVID pandemic history. In the last 7 days, on average, the state has added 242 deaths and 22 556 cases each day, according to Herald calculations.

The jump in the number of reported cases and deaths is due to the newest way deaths and cases are counted. The CDC implemented the change earlier this month [August 2021], causing occasional one-day aberrations like the 901 additional deaths on Thursday [26 Aug 2021] and 726 more deaths reported Monday [23 Aug 2021].

In all, Florida has recorded at least 3 151 909 confirmed COVID cases statewide and 43 632 deaths.

As of the Thursday [26 Aug 2021] report, 11 138 433 eligible Floridians -- 51.9% of the state's population -- had completed the 2-dose series of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna, or have completed Johnson & Johnson's single-dose vaccine, according to the CDC.

Kerala recorded 30 000-plus fresh COVID-19 cases for the 2nd day running, taking India's daily count to over 44 500 on Thursday [26 Aug 2021].

India reported 44 510 fresh cases of the virus, with Kerala alone accounting for 30 007 new infections. The state had recorded 31 445 cases on Wednesday [25 Aug 2021], making it the 1st state in nearly 3 months (since 29 May 2021) to register more than 30 000 fresh infections in a day. India's daily count of COVID cases had crossed 46 000 on Wednesday [25 Aug 2021].

With the number of cases exploding after the Onam week, Kerala reported a test positivity rate (TPR) of over 18% on Thursday [26 Aug 2021]. The TPR [test positivity rate] in the state has been steadily rising, indicating that infections may still be on the rise.

Meanwhile, Maharashtra logged more than 5000 new cases for the 2nd day in a row. The state recorded 5108 fresh COVID infections on Thursday [26 Aug 2021], up slightly from the previous day's tally of 5031. Prior to Wednesday [25 Aug 2021], Maharashtra's daily count of cases had remained below 5000 for 5 days. Despite the seeming surge, daily numbers in the state have remained lower than the corresponding days of the previous week.

Andhra Pradesh and Bengal too were witnessing a minor surge in infections since Wednesday [25 Aug 2021]. Andhra Pradesh reported 1539 cases on Thursday [26 Aug 2021] and 1601 on Wednesday, both numbers slightly higher than last week's peak of 1501. Bengal logged 717 and 708 in the last 2 days. These numbers, however, were lower than the previous week's peak.

India recorded 486 deaths from the virus on Thursday [26 Aug 2021], down from the previous day's surprisingly high toll of 603. Kerala reported 162 fatalities, Maharashtra 159, Odisha 66, Tamil Nadu 26, and Karnataka 25.

With new infections outnumbering recoveries in the last 3 days, active cases in the country have increased by more than 22 000 since Monday [23 Aug 2021] to over 3.4 lakh [340 000] on Thursday [26 Aug 2021].

https://www.dailymirror.lk/latest_news/Extension-of-nationwide-lockdown-Decision-today/342-219113


A decision will be taken today [27 Aug 2021] whether the countrywide lockdown will be further extended after Monday [30 Aug 2021] when the COVID-19 Task Force convenes with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella told Daily Mirror yesterday [26 Aug 2021].

In a meeting held between Rambukwella and the health trade unions yesterday morning [26 Aug 2021], it was discussed that extending the lockdown further would not serve many purposes as the only way out of the crisis was to ensure that all citizens are fully vaccinated as soon as possible, the Daily Mirror learns.

Rambukwella at the meeting had informed that he was personally against the lockdown as it severely affected the economy and the livelihoods of the daily wage earners, but a final decision will be taken today after due consideration of the opinion of all experts.

He said that according to scientific evidence, the moment a lockdown is enforced there is a slight decline of the cases, however, COVID-19 begins to spread once the country re-opens once again, "so where do we draw the line?" he questioned.

The minister further said that vaccination and self-discipline were the only way out of this pandemic and authorities would continue to administer the doses until the targets are achieved. "According to the figures I received, less than 2% of those fully vaccinated have died from the virus while 12.5% of those who received the 1st dose have died of COVID-19; 86% of the deaths were of those who were not vaccinated," he said.

At today's meeting [27 Aug 2021], the Daily Mirror learns that a proposal will also be submitted if area-wise lockdowns could be enforced rather than extending the nationwide lockdown. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa will announce the final decision today following the meeting. If the lockdown is not extended, it will be lifted on Monday [30 Aug 2021] at 4:00 am.

The South Asian COVID-19 situation, according to data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as of 27 Aug 2021 at 05:46 GMT:

Country: Total cases / Total deaths / Deaths per million population
India: 32 603 188 / 436 889 / 313
Bangladesh: 1 482 628 / 25 729/ 154
Pakistan: 1 144 341 / 25 415 / 113
Nepal: 754 915 / 10 638 / 358
Sri Lanka: 412 370 / 8157 / 379
Afghanistan: 152 960 / 7101 / 178
Maldives: 80 436 / 225 / 408
Bhutan: 2591 / 3 / 4

Over the last 7 days, 244 359, 35 418, 27 455, 12 687, 39 205, and 512 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Afghanistan, respectively, compared with 241 003, 50 342, 26 973, 16 459, 28 047, and 678 in the preceding 7 days, revealing a slightly upward trend again in India, a sharp declining trend in Bangladesh, a slightly increasing trend in Pakistan, a decreasing trend in Nepal, a stable trend with a low number of newly detected cases in Afghanistan, but skyrocketing of the already developed peak with more and more new cases in Sri Lanka.

Live Situational Analysis on COVID-19 cases in Sri Lanka can be seen at https://hpb.health.gov.lk/covid19-dashboard/. The number of daily laboratory-confirmed cases has crossed the mark of 4000 in the country, as indicated in item [E] above, and the number of daily deaths has also crossed the mark of 200. Over the last 24 hours, a total of 209 people died of COVID-19 (https://hpb.health.gov.lk/covid19-dashboard/) in the country. To curb the spread of the virus, the country has imposed a 10-day long nationwide lockdown from the night of 20 Aug 2021 to 30 Aug 2021 (https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/sri-lankans-seek-full-covid-lockdown-ahead-presidents-address-2021-08-20/), which could be extended further.

There is no clear picture yet that a slight increase of new cases over the course of the last 7 days in Pakistan would turn into the development of a bigger new wave in the country due to the spread of the delta variant. According to data as of 17 Aug 2021 at 11:41 AM, around 50 985 184 doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the country (https://ncoc.gov.pk/covid-vaccination-en.php).

The daily-case positivity and number of deaths associated with COVID-19 are dropping sharply in Bangladesh. The current case positivity rate is around 14%, as indicated in item [A] above, around 4% lower compared to the rate observed in the preceding week. The total number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 exceeded the milestone of 25 000 in the country. However, there is an indication that the daily number of deaths associated with the disease would fall below 100 soon, as a total of 102 people died yesterday (26 Aug 2021). Bangladesh has a plan of vaccinating 80% population above the age of 18 years. So far, of the target population, only 15% have received the 1st dose and 6% have received both 1st and 2nd doses (http://103.247.238.92/webportal/pages/covid19-vaccination-update.php).

There is now an alarming sign in India that new cases started creeping up over the last 7 days, although counts predominantly from 2 states, Kerala and Maharashtra, contributed largely to see this upward trend after a slow but persistent downward trend over a significant period of time. Only time will say whether this temporal increase will again turn into the development of a new wave in the country. Over 600 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have been administered so far in India (https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/india-vaccinations-cross-60-crore-doses-32-coverage-at-this-rate-by-december-2518423#pfrom=home-coronavirus_coronavirus-lateststories_live).
