Britain said it had brought its devastating 8-week-old foot & mouth
disease (FMD) epidemic "fully under control," but government plans to
kill off the disease through vaccination met resistance from farmers.
Prime Minister Tony Blair's chief scientific adviser said the number
of fresh outbreaks was falling faster than expected and predicted they
would continue to halve every 2 weeks.
"On the basis of the fall in the number of cases reported, the
epidemic is now fully under control," Professor David King told
reporters.
More than a million livestock have been slaughtered in an effort to
contain the highly infectious disease, and the government has asked
farmers to support a vaccination scheme to complement the cull.
Farmers' reaction has been mixed, but many fear vaccination could
actually prolong the outbreak, and say there would be no market for
beef or milk from vaccinated animals.
"I have not been convinced of the relevance of the vaccine at this
particular time,'' National Farmers' Union leader Ben Gill said after
meeting King. King said there was a need for vaccination now as
farmers prepared to move cattle from indoor winter quarters out into
spring pastures, where they were more vulnerable to infection.
EU vets have approved vaccination for parts of Britain and the
Netherlands. Germany said it was putting on hold a decision on whether
to allow the state of North-Rhine Westphalia to apply for EU-backed
vaccinations.
King said Britain was now reporting about 20 new daily cases of the
disease, compared with around 40 a day 2 weeks ago. The downward trend
was expected to continue, with the number of fresh outbreaks halving
every 2 weeks. He said he was able to declare the epidemic "under
control," but he said the rate of new outbreaks in Devon, in southwest
England, remained a cause for concern.

Today's [21 Apr 2001 total is given as 20 [new cases. Interpolation
of this graph and the number at the end of the series, gives a rerun
of the article by Roly Tinline and Martin Hugh-Jones, who reported an
8-day interfarm interval during 1967-68. J Hygiene (1976) 77: 141-153,
"Studies on the 1967-68 foot and mouth disease epidemic: incubation
period and herd serial interval." Towards the end of that epidemic it
stretched to "about two weeks."
Deja vu all over again. If this is continues to hold true, we can
expect to see an up-and-down progress to the end, with accompanying
increases and losses of confidence. - MHJ.

Britain will not be allowed to trade its meat or livestock with the
rest of the world for at least 3 years, twice previous official
estimates, one of the Government's principal scientific advisers on
foot and mouth disease (FMD) said. Gareth Davies, a former head of
epidemiology at MAFF and the European Commission, said the delay would
be largely the same regardless of whether or not the Government
decided on selective vaccination to bring down the number of livestock
that had to be killed. [Presumably this means killed immediately.
Earlier statements have been that all vaccinated livestock would
eventually have to be killed in order for the UK to regain FMD-free
status. - Mod.JW
Mr Davies, who presided over Europe's switch of policy from
vaccination to slaughter, said he had changed his mind and there now
had to be "a complete rethink" of how the European Union fought animal
diseases. He and the Government's other scientific advisers favor the
limited use of vaccination.
Conditions on farms had changed with huge numbers of animals
concentrated on single farms and thousands of livestock movements
every week by road. Mr Davies was recently drafted on to the chief
scientist's panel, which advises the crisis committee chaired by Tony
Blair.
Previously, the Government's line has been that Britain's
"disease-free" status could be restored a year after the last
vaccinated animal was killed or a year after the last case of the
disease, whichever was the longer. However, it is difficult to remove
a block from a country.
If the last case takes place towards the end of the year, farmers have
been assuming trade would open up in approximately 18 months. Mr
Davies, now a consultant to the EU and the United Nations (UN) Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO), said: "It is important to realize
in this epidemic it's going to take us several years before we are
able to prove to our trading partners that we are free of disease. I
would have thought we are talking about 3 years. We have to prove we
have no circulating infection in the livestock population. That means
an extensive program of serological surveillance, and following up
with other examinations, to prove to our trading partners we are free
of circulating antibodies."
A number of "false positives" and true cases could be expected well
after the last declared case -- which vets assume could be towards the
end of this year because of the notorious "long tail" of FMD
epidemics. Under EU rules it is theoretically possible for a region
not having the disease to regain its disease-free status within 3
months of the last case in the country as a whole.
But Mr Davies said if he was sitting in Brussels he would "find it
difficult to conceive of realistic regionalization at the moment." He
said MAFF scientists were already looking at an "exit strategy for
clearing the national sheep flocks -- the principal carrier of the
disease in this outbreak -- so we can say we do not have disease".

Wider outbreak feared in the Netherlands
------------------------------------
The foot-and-mouth (FMD) outbreak in the Netherlands has been a
fraction of that in the UK, with 25 cases compared with Britain's
1411. But so far, about 100 000 Dutch animals have been slaughtered
and another 115 000 cows, sheep, goats, and pigs in the east of the
country have been vaccinated in an attempt to prevent the spread of
the disease.
Most of the cases registered in the Netherlands have been in the
eastern province of Gelderland. However an outbreak in Friesland --
140 km away -- last week has raised fears that there are numerous
farms where the disease has not been detected.
Belgium has been tightening controls along its border with the
Netherlands, while Germany has applied to vaccinate a million
cloven-hoofed animals within 25km of the country.

Dutch farm disease policy under fire
--------------------------------
Thousands of people have gathered in The Hague in the Netherlands for
a protest rally against the mass slaughter of farm animals to combat
the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) epidemic. The protesters complain the
policy, which involves killing thousands of healthy sheep, pigs, and
cows to stop the spread of the disease, is immoral, wasteful, and
unfair to farmers. They want the authorities to switch to vaccinating
animals.
Currently the European Union is only allowing vaccination as a
temporary measure, because a comprehensive change of policy would hit
exports to Japan and the United States, which insist all meat be free
of the FMD virus.

MEIGH, Northern Ireland -- This borderland has long been known a haven
for smugglers. These days, the most dangerous contraband is
[livestock. On both sides of the frontier dividing the Republic of
Ireland from Northern Ireland, livestock smuggling has become the bete
noire of authorities fighting to contain the spread of foot-and-mouth
disease (FMD).
Unauthorized movement of a herd of sheep is being blamed for Northern
Ireland's first outbreak of the highly contagious virus 6 weeks ago,
in the border village of Meigh. Illicit animal transport is also being
investigated as a factor in 2 new cases having appeared 6 days ago in
the province. A third suspect farm has been sealed off.
Since smuggling has continued since the first outbreak, there is [no
question as to the smugglers' motive. The incentive is money.
Livestock smugglers profit by the strength of the British pound versus
the euro, the European currency to which the Irish pound is linked.
They also gain by illegally claiming European Union farming subsidies
available in the Republic of Ireland, but not in the north. The heart
of the smuggling trade is South Armagh, a traditional stronghold of
the Irish Republican Army. Although the IRA has been observing a
cease-fire since 1997, some of its senior members are known to have
turned their hand to smuggling rackets that traffic in fuel and
cigarettes.
All livestock movement is now banned in Northern Ireland, so
authorities are struggling with the twin tasks of halting cross-border
trafficking and preventing animals from being moved clandestinely
within the province.
FMD usually spells economic disaster for farmers in countries
exporting agricultural products. Another problem is tracking animals
possibly brought into Northern Ireland on condition they be
slaughtered immediately, but being kept alive and resold instead.
Authorities are now trying to trace the movements of cows, sheep, and
pigs imported in the weeks before the disease surfaced in England.
