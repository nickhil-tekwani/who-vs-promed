Viet Nam: absence of transmission of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus to
hospital staff in 2004
-----------------------------------------------
[The following is the Abstract and Discussion sections of a paper published
in the current issue of the Journal of Emerging Infectious Diseases, which
provides some of the 1st data on seroprevalence of avian influenza virus in
a section of the human population at risk in Viet Nam. The paper is
entitled: "Lack of H5N1 Avian Influenza Transmission to Hospital Employees,
Hanoi, 2004," and it is authored by Nguyen Thanh Liem, (World Health
Organization International Avian Influenza Investigation Team, Viet Nam),
National Pediatric Hospital, Hanoi, Viet Nam; and Wilina Lim, Department of
Health, Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region, China. - Mod.CP]
Abstract
--------
"To establish whether human-to-human transmission of influenza A (H5N1)
virus occurred in the healthcare setting in Viet Nam, we conducted a
cross-sectional seroprevalence survey among hospital employees exposed to 4
confirmed and one probable H5N1 case-patients or their clinical specimens.
83 (95.4 percent) of 87 eligible employees completed a questionnaire and
provided a serum sample, which was tested for antibodies to influenza A
(H5N1) virus. 95 percent reported exposure to more than one H5N1
case-patient; 59 (72.0 percent) reported symptoms, and 2 (2.4 percent)
fulfilled the definition for a possible H5N1 secondary case-patient.
No study participants had detectable antibodies to influenza A (H5N1)
virus. The data suggest that the H5N1 viruses responsible for human cases
in Viet Nam in January 2004 are not readily transmitted from
person-to-person. However, influenza viruses are genetically variable, and
transmissibility is difficult to predict. Therefore, persons providing care
for H5N1 patients should continue to take measures to protect themselves."
Discussion
----------
No evidence was found of nosocomial transmission of H5N1 viruses among 83
hospital employees with exposure to 4 confirmed and one probable H5N1
case-patients or their clinical samples. A number of possible factors may
explain these findings: a lack of infectivity of the patients at the time
of admission; the effective use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and
infection control; low sensitivity of the antibody detection method; lack
of susceptibility of HCWs, or a lack of transmissibility of this particular
H5N1 strain.
No data are available on the duration of H5N1 virus shedding in children.
However, for human influenza virus, viral shedding at high titers is
generally more prolonged in children, and virus can be recovered up to 6
days before and 21 days after the onset of symptoms. The H5N1 patients in
this study were admitted with severe illness 3-7 days after onset of
symptoms, and PCR-positive specimens were obtained from the 4 confirmed
case-patients on day one (one patient), day 2 (one patient), and day 3 (2
patients) after admission. In addition, live virus was cultured from
samples taken from 2 of the patients on days one and 3 after admission,
respectively. None of the patients were treated with Oseltamivir, because
this was not available at the time. 2 of the patients were treated orally
with the nucleoside analogue ribavirin during their admission, one on day 4
after admission, and the other on day one (9). However, the 2 other
confirmed case-patients and the probable case-patient did not receive
antiviral treatment and, if human infection with H5N1 is associated with
viral shedding, these patients would be expected to be contagious during
their admission.
Most hospital employees (94.8 percent) reported that they always wore masks
while caring for H5N1 patients, and, often, the reported type of mask was
an N95 respirator. However, N95 respirators were 1st available in NPH on 7
Jan 2004, and some employees reported wearing N95s before this date.
Therefore, reported PPE use in this study may be biased by inaccurate
recall or a tendency to report behavior that HCWs know is recommended.
Enhanced infection control practices and PPE were instituted on 7 Jan 2004,
and the diagnosis of avian influenza was 1st confirmed on 9 Jan 2004.
Therefore, some HCWs in this study were likely exposed to H5N1 patients
without optimal PPE or infection control.
Oseltamivir prophylaxis was not used by any of the staff in this study and
therefore did not play a role in protecting HCWs. Whether the HCWs in the
study were protected by cross-reactive immunity to other influenza A
subtypes is hard to assess. One possible explanation for the observation
that most confirmed H5N1 case-patients are reported in children or young
adults is that older adults are protected by cross-reactive immunity from
previous exposure to other influenza A viruses. This hypothesis requires
further investigation.
Serum samples were taken from HCWs at least 29 days after last possible
exposure and at a time when the antibody response to exposure would be
expected to be detectable. Based on a small number of samples, the
sensitivity of a microneutralization test in detecting antibodies to H5N1
in children and adults is 88 percent and 80 percent, respectively, while
the specificity is 100 percent and 93 percent, respectively. Also, the
microneutralization assay utilized H5N1 strains isolated from human
patients in North Viet Nam, so the negative results are unlikely to be
false negatives due to a poor match between antigen and antibody.
False-positive results are perhaps more likely, and one sample was
initially positive but appeared to be due to cross-reacting anti-N1 antibody.
Epidemiologic evidence from Viet Nam and Thailand clearly indicates that
sustained human-to-human transmission of H5N1 has not yet occurred. Most
reports of H5N1-infected patients have been sporadic, and despite the
evidence from Hong Kong of human-to-human transmission and the occurrence
of family clusters of H5N1 in Viet Nam and Thailand, no evidence indicates
that influenza A H5N1 has ever caused more than a single generation of
human-to-human transmission. Although this study has not distinguished the
inherent transmissibility of the virus from the influence of infection
control or host resistance, the data provides further reassurance that the
risk for human-to-human transmission of currently circulating avian H5N1
viruses is low. Studies among household members of confirmed H5N1
case-patients will provide additional information on the risk for
human-to-human transmission in the absence of infection control measures.
While the absolute risk for human-to-human transmission of avian H5N1
viruses may be low at this time, the high case-fatality proportion seen
among recent human H5N1 patients demonstrates that the individual
consequences of infection are very serious, and intensive measures to
protect healthcare workers and laboratory staff against infection remain
warranted. The risk of human-to-human transmission of H5N1 viruses could
increase in the future. Consequently, every H5N1 case should be managed by
clinicians and public health professionals with the assumption that
human-to-human transmission can occur and that the risk for such
transmission is unpredictable.
