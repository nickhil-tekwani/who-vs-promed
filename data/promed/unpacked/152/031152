[Helen Branswell on Twitter reports 2 additional cases: "#Ebola: +2 cases in DRC's Equateur outbreak. The new cases are at Bikoro, which is quite remote; Mbandaka, which is a large city on the Congo River. Cases there pose a risk of major spread. 36 cases to date, 14 deaths. 7759 people have been vaccinated with the Merck vaccine." See https://t.co/Wkt8jZouQg for table of cases by location.]

The total number of confirmed cases of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo rose to 30, with 13 deaths, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Wednesday [1 Jul 2020].

In the 11th Ebola outbreak, the UN agency said in a Twitter post, some 33 cases [now 36], including 30 confirmed and 3 probable, were reported in Mbandaka, the capital of Equateur Province.

Last month [June 2020], the WHO expressed concern over the 11th Ebola outbreak in the country's west. "We are very concerned about this new outbreak in Mbandaka, where we have worked very closely with the government in 2018 to contain the last outbreak," said WHO Regional Director for Africa Dr. Matshidiso Moeti.

Ebola, a tropical fever that first appeared in 1976 in Sudan and the DRC, is transmitted to humans from wild animals. It can also spread through contact with body fluids of infected people, or of those who have succumbed to the virus.

Ebola caused global alarm in 2014 when the world's worst outbreak began in West Africa, killing more than 11 300 people and infecting an estimated 28 600 as it swept through Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone.

[2] Outbreak summaries
- Thu 2 Jul 2020. Ebola news scan
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) abridged, edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/07/news-scan-jul-02-2020

One more Ebola case has been confirmed in an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo's (DRC's) Equateur province, raising the total to 34 [now 36], according to a statement from the country's multisectoral Ebola technical committee (CMRE).

The patient is from Mbandaka, the provincial capital, and apparently died from his or her infection. The death raises the outbreak total to 14. A small but steady stream of cases continues to be reported in the outbreak, the DRC's 11th, which was first detected in early June [2020].

In another Ebola development, the European Commission yesterday approved Johnson & Johnson's 2-dose Ebola vaccine known as Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo. The announcement follows a recommendation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in late May [2020] that the vaccine be approved. The European Commission usually follows the EMA recommendations.

The vaccine, the 2nd to be approved for Ebola alongside VSV-EBOV, was introduced for use in the DRC in November 2019 as part of a clinical trial. The vaccine's 2 doses are given 8 weeks apart.

Officials have reported 4 more confirmed cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Equateur province Ebola outbreak, raising the total to 28, the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office said today [Mon 29 Jun 2020] on Twitter.

So far, no details on the latest cases in the DRC's 11th Ebola outbreak are noted. Of the 28 cases, 25 are lab confirmed, and 3 are listed as probable. The number of deaths held steady at 13.

On 25 Jun [2020], the country declared an end to its 10th outbreak, which was centered around North Kivu and Ituri provinces and was by far the country's biggest and longest. The current outbreak is occurring in the same area of northwestern DRC where a small outbreak -- the DRC's 9th -- was reported in 2018.

[3] Vaccine
- Wed 1 Jul 2020. Press release
[European Commission, abridged, edited]
https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_1248

Today [Wed 1 Jul 2020], the European Commission adopted the decision granting marketing authorisations to the company Janssen, a Johnson & Johnson company, for a vaccine against Ebola. The authorisation was granted in one month, reducing the decision-making process timing in half, further demonstrating the Commission's commitment in placing the protection of public health as a priority.

The new Ebola vaccine, which consists of 2 components, called Zabdeno and Mvabea, had been in development with the support of the Commission. This decision follows a recommendation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which has assessed the benefits and risks of the vaccine.

Stella Kyriakides, Commissioner in charge of Health and Food Safety, said: "This is the 2nd Ebola vaccine that the Commission authorises in less than a year and confirms once again that the EU remains at the forefront of the global effort to save lives from this virus. We know very well from the coronavirus crisis that viruses do not respect borders; protecting the health of others protects the health of all."

Mariya Gabriel, Commissioner in charge of Research, said: "Today [Wed 1 Jul 2020], we can be glad to have supported the development of the Ebola vaccine with EU funding, in partnership with the European pharmaceutical sector under the Innovative Medicines Initiative. The investment from the EU's research programme Horizon 2020 into several Innovative Medicines Initiative Ebola projects is now bearing fruit. This demonstrates, yet again, the power of collaboration and European R&I leadership to tackle global health threats."

As explained by EMA when it recommended the approval last February [2020], the ability of the immune system to respond to the virus after vaccination with Zabdeno and Mvabea was studied in a total of 3367 adults, adolescents, and children who participated in 5 clinical studies conducted in Europe, Africa, and the US.

The development of the vaccine is the result of rigorous work by several projects funded with just over EUR 130 million [USD 146.18 million] through the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), which is partly supported by the EU's research and innovation programme, Horizon 2020. Following a comprehensive approach, the EBOVAC 1, 2 & 3, projects assessed the safety and tolerability of the Ebola vaccine regimen through clinical trials in Europe and Africa. The EBODAC project developed a communication strategy and tools to promote the acceptance and uptake of new Ebola vaccines. Finally, the EBOMAN project focused on accelerating the development and manufacture of the vaccine.

- Fri 3 Jul 2020, J&J's Ebola vaccine approved in EU
[Pharmaphorum, edited]
https://pharmaphorum.com/news/jjs-ebola-vaccine-approved-in-eu/

The European Commission has approved Johnson & Johnson's Ebola vaccine, developed by its Janssen pharmaceuticals unit and Bavarian Nordic. This is the 1st major regulatory approval of the vaccine developed by Janssen and Bavarian Nordic, which produces the 2nd part of the 2-dose jab.

The vaccine is designed to induce long-term immunity against the Ebola virus in adults and children aged one year and above.

It will be used to support preventive vaccination in countries most at risk of outbreaks, as well as for other at-risk groups such as healthcare workers, biosafety laboratory workers, military personnel deployed in the affected regions, airport staff, and visitors to high-risk countries.

The vaccine involves a 1st dose based around Janssen's Zebov administered with the company's AdVac viral vector technology and a 2nd dose known as Mvabea developed by Bavarian Nordic.

Based in Copenhagen, Bavarian Nordic is set to receive a milestone payment of USD 10 million under a license agreement with Janssen dating back to 2014.

The approval follows a positive opinion by the CHMP of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in May [2020]. The vaccine regimen is indicated for active immunisation for prevention of disease caused by Ebola virus in individuals aged one year and above.

Janssen supported vaccination initiatives in the Democratic Republic of Congo and neighbouring Rwanda, with the goal of preventing Ebola's geographic spread beyond the outbreak zone.

This followed a recommendation in May 2019 from the World Health Organization's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on immunisation, which backed the use of the Janssen Ebola vaccine regimen.

Including clinical studies and vaccination initiatives, approximately 60 000 people have been vaccinated with Janssen's regimen to date.

This is the 2nd Ebola vaccine approved by the European Commission: in November [2019] it granted a marketing authorisation to MSD's vaccine known as Ervebo.

This vaccine has been shown to produce effective protection against onset of the virus with a single dose.
