New Zealand's endangered parrots could be under further threat from a
new genotype of a virulent disease that scientists at the University
of Canterbury have recently helped identify.

The scientists are calling for urgent action to protect native parrot
populations and are calling on conservation authorities to monitor
the incidence of infection.

Dr Arvind Varsani, Dr Melanie Massaro, and Dr Brigitta Kurenbach
(Biological Sciences) have been working with Massey University PhD
candidate Luis Ortiz-Catedral, who has been monitoring and
documenting the incidence of beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) in
the endangered New Zealand parrot, the red-fronted parakeet.

The results of this research were recently published in the journal,
Archives of Virology, in a paper titled "A new isolate of beak and
feather disease virus from endemic wild red-fronted parakeets in New
Zealand" [abstract available at
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20180139>].

The team has been working to identify the genotype of the BFDV
infecting the parakeets on Little Barrier Island, where an incidence
of approximately 25 percent infection was found by Ortiz-Catedral in
earlier research he conducted on the island.

The virus causes psittacine beak and feather disease, a common viral
disease found worldwide that affects parrots and cockatoos. Birds
affected by the disease can lose their feathers, suffer beak
deformities, and their immune systems weaken, making them susceptible
to other infections. There is no cure and it is usually fatal.

In their paper, the team said there was an urgent need to protect
endemic parrot populations from infection and recommended that the
incidence of BFDV infections in both wild and captive parrots be
monitored by conservation authorities, and that breeders and those
working with psittaformes be made aware of the consequences of
outbreaks of the disease.

"These actions are pivotal for identifying and implementing
management programmes aimed at containing the dissemination of BDFV
to captive and wild populations of species at risk of extinction,"
the researchers said.

Dr Varsani said it was the 1st time full BFDV genomes from New
Zealand had been documented. In the past, researchers in New Zealand
had only looked at partial sequences of BFDV isolated from introduced parrots.

"No-one has characterised the virus at full genome level in New
Zealand before and when we compared it to isolates from around the
world we found the New Zealand isolate was significantly different to
other available BDFV genomes. This means the BFDV isolates from
red-fronted parakeets represent a new genotype of the virus."

Dr Varsani said the discovery of a distinct genotype of BFDV raised
questions about whether there were other genotypes or recombinants of
the virus in New Zealand, and the potential harm it may have on other
endangered native parrot species, such as the kakapo, orange-fronted
parakeet, or the Forbes parakeet.

"Our goal now is to document the diversity of beak and feather
disease virus in New Zealand to determine if they are recombinants
and assess their virulence. This information will be of great
importance to psittacine conservation programmes," Dr Varsani said.

Ortiz-Catedral, who approached Dr Varsani with the project, carried
out the fieldwork by collecting blood samples from 54 red-fronted
parakeets on Little Barrier Island with help from Department of
Conservation staff and volunteers.

Dr Massaro said the discovery provided the 1st evidence that native
parrots, rather than just introduced species, were infected with the
virus. However, it was difficult to know how the virus had spread as
red-fronted parakeets were mainly found on New Zealand's offshore
islands. It was also difficult to tell whether the virus was a new
arrival or had been around for some time.

She said the parakeets may have been infected from introduced
psittacine species, escapees from breeding facilities or the virus
isolate could have been endemic to New Zealand but remained
undetected in wild species. Transferring birds from one island to
another as part of New Zealand's conservation strategy could also be
spreading the disease.

"Another issue is researchers who go from island to island -- we
could potentially be indirect [or is it unintentional -- Mod.TG]
vectors for the disease."

Dr Kurenbach said it was amazing to see how a team of scientists from
different fields -- ecologists, molecular biologists, and virologists
-- could be pulled together to address a question in a short period of time.

The team has recently secured funding from the Brian Mason Trust to
train Department of Conservation personnel in BFDV screening and to
study BFDV in native and introduced parrots in the Canterbury and
Westland region.

[This article does not tell us if surveillance of the endangered
birds on this island showed they were dying at higher than normal
rates, hence the research, or if this particular disease is of
interest and the researcher just happened to select this island. The
fact that 25 percent of the endangered birds are dying is a high rate
and should alarm researchers.

One has to wonder when the disease came to the island, and how it got
there. These questions may never be answered as the researchers must
move on from here.

Psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD)
------------------------------------------
The virus causing this disease is a member of the _Circoviridae_
family. The molecular structure of the genome of the virus is roughly
a 2000 base, circular, single stranded DNA. PBFD virus has a strong
resemblance to porcine circovirus as well as to a number of plant
viruses such as the banana bungy virus.

The disease is thought to be specific for psittacines and all
psittacine species should be considered susceptible. Parrots known to
be particularly affected by PBFD include, but are not limited to,
cockatoos, macaws, African grey parrots, ringneck parakeets, Eclectus
parrots, lovebirds.

The virus causes fatal infections, primarily in young birds. Older
birds may overcome the disease with few lasting affects. Some believe
that these surviving birds become carriers able to shed the disease
at a later date. Others believe that a percentage of birds are able
to eradicate the disease from their system leaving them with a
natural immunity that can be passed on to their offspring.

The virus that causes PBFD can also affect the liver, brain, and
immune system causing diminished resistance to infections.
Consequently premature death usually occurs from these secondary
bacterial, fungal, parasitic, or viral infections.

Transmission of the virus from one individual to another is primarily
through direct contact, inhalation, or ingestion of aerosols,
crop-feeding, infected fecal material, and feather dust. The virus
can also be transmitted via contaminated surfaces such as bird
carriers, feeding formula, utensils, food dishes, clothing, and
nesting materials. The viral particles, if not destroyed can remain
viable in the environment for months, long after the infected bird is
gone. Hence, unsuspecting researchers moving between islands may
indeed be the vectors. Stricter biosecurity will surely be required.

Signs of the disease include irreversible loss of feathers, shedding
of developing feathers, development of abnormal feathers, new pinched
feathers, and loss of powder down. Other possible symptoms include
overgrown or abnormal beak, symmetrical lesions on the beak and
occasionally nails. Immunosuppression, rapid weight loss, and
depression are also possible in later stages of the disease.

Prevention is the best way to avoid the disease. Strict isolation of
all diseased birds to halt the spread of the disease. DNA testing of
all birds of susceptible species to rule out latent infection.

With a new sequence, other birds may be more susceptible or
researchers may find in other birds, or perhaps discover in some
birds it does not have much effect, or perhaps is more virulent in
other birds. While the discovery is interesting, perhaps alarming, it
certainly raises more questions than answers.
