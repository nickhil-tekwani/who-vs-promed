A case of measles has been confirmed at Ormskirk Hospital, and 3 more suspected cases are being investigated. More than 600 cases have been confirmed in the northwest this year [2012], with most on Merseyside and in west Lancashire. Southport and Ormskirk Hospital NHS [National Health Service] Trust said the confirmed case was a child who had attended the hospital's accident and emergency unit. A further 2 suspected cases, one adult and one child, were seen by the trust on Saturday [24 Nov 2012].

Dr Geraldine Boocock, medical director of the trust, said: "Measles is an avoidable viral illness that is highly infectious and spreads easily among people who are not protected by 2 doses of MMR vaccine. "Although most people will get over measles without too many problems, a significant number will develop serious complications including ear infection, diarrhoea, pneumonia or meningitis.

"People who suspect they or a family member has measles should telephone their GP before attending GP surgeries, NHS walk-in centres or hospital A and E departments. "This allows arrangements to be made in advance to minimise the measles patients' contact with other people who may be vulnerable to infection."

Health bosses have written to dozens of parents in Newmains after a measles outbreak in the village. NHS [National Health Service] Lanarkshire sent messages last week to the parents of pupils at Newmains Nursery Centre and Morningside Primary. In both Newmains and Larkhall, there are now 12 confirmed and one suspected case of the infectious disease. The children and young people affected are currently recovering at home.

Health officials wrote to all of the parents to inform them of the situation and offer advice and MMR vaccine for some children and young people. However, it emerged that over 94 per cent of the youngsters have already had at least one MMR treatment already.

NHS Lanarkshire's health protection team have been responding to the outbreak. Dr David Cromie, consultant in public health medicine and a member of the response team, spoke to the Wishaw Press about the outbreak. He said: "Although the cases caught measles in their own communities, some of them have attended local schools and could spread the illness to others. As such, we have written to the parents of pupils at Newmains Nursery Centre, Morningside Primary in Newmains and Larkhall Academy to inform them of the situation and offer health advice and MMR vaccine for some children and young people. MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccination provides good individual protection against measles, and a high uptake rate in a social group helps prevent measles from spreading. So, it is very encouraging that over 94 per cent of children attending these schools have had at least one dose of MMR. However, we are recommending that all children should have at least one dose of MMR, and those who are over 3 years 4 months of age should have 2 doses of MMR vaccine."

Dr Cromie continued: "Those who would benefit from MMR vaccine are being offered the jab by public health nurses. Measles used to be a common disease of childhood but is currently rare. It is a very infectious disease caused by a virus. It is spread from person to person by sneezing and coughing. Most people who get measles get a fever, rash, runny nose, sore throat -- with white spots in the mouth -- and cough. They can feel quite unwell for a week and usually recover completely within a few weeks, but for some, it can be very severe and even life threatening. If anyone is concerned that they or their children may have measles, they should contact their GP."

A map showing the location of North Lanarkshire can be accessed at: http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2002/08/15279/10311. It is surprising that so many cases are still being recorded in an area where vaccine uptake has reached 94 percent. - Mod.CP

Public Health Wales is investigating following 12 cases of probable measles and 4 confirmed cases in individuals living in Swansea, Port Talbot, and Haverfordwest. Two individuals have been hospitalised but have since been discharged.

The cases are believed to be associated with people who stayed at a holiday camp in southwest England during the 2nd half of October 2012. The Health Protection Agency [HPA] in southwest England is working closely with the holiday camp to investigate.

Letters are being sent to 5 schools in the affected areas advising them that measles is circulating. A vaccination catch up session is also being arranged for all unimmunised pupils at Pentrehafod Comprehensive School, Swansea.

Parents of pupils at other affected schools are being asked to ensure that children aged between one and 16 who have not received 2 doses of the MMR vaccine should contact their GP to arrange vaccination. Arrangements have been made with GPs in the affected areas to ensure that the likely increase in demand for MMR can be met.

Dr Jorg Hoffmann, consultant in communicable disease Control for Public Health Wales, said: "Measles can be prevented by use of the safe and highly effective measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Parents can easily protect their children by having them immunised with the MMR vaccine. After completing a 2-dose course of MMR, 99 percent of children will be protected against measles. The only way to prevent outbreaks of measles is to ensure that at least 95 percent of children in Wales have received 2 doses of the MMR vaccine. Although more children are having the vaccine now, we still have some way to go before we can guarantee the safety of children in Wales from measles."

Measles is a highly infectious disease that can cause complications including pneumonia, meningitis and encephalitis, particularly in children under 5 years of age, those with weakened immune systems, and children with a poor diet. It can even be fatal in rare cases. Many people who catch measles will have a fever, cough, red eyes, and blocked nose and feel generally unwell. The blotchy rash appears a few days later beginning on the face and spreading downwards to the rest of the body over several days. Typically, people will be infectious from a few days before the onset of their rash until 4-5 days after the onset of the rash. Most people make a full recovery but there is a rare possibility of severe complications including serious eye disorders, deafness, brain damage and even death.

A team from the World Health Organisation (WHO) rushed on Wednesday [28 Nov 2012] to investigate the reasons for an outbreak of [measles] in the town of Thari Mirwah in Khairpur [district].

The WHO Surveillance Officer, Dr Asad Soomro, along with DHO [Department of Health officer] Khairpur and other health officials, reached Aajb Khan Dasti and other villages [around] Thari Mirwah town, where 8 children had died of measles.

During its visit to other villages, the team found that most of the villagers had not gotten their children vaccinated against measles. The team also found that the disease developed into pneumonia, which resulted in deaths of the children. Investigation also revealed that the parents, instead of taking their children to health centres, took them for cure to Hindu spiritual men.

The team found that there were 98 measles cases in Khairpur town, 95 in Kingri, 38 in Kotdiji, 121 in Gambat, 19 in Nara, 41 in Thari Mirwah town, and 18 in Faiz Gunj Town. The team said 17 children, including 9 in Thari Mirwah, 6 in Gambat and 2 in Kingri Taluka had died of measles.
