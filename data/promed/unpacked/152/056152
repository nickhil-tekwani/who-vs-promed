Satendra Kumar, AQIS Quarantine Plant Pathologist, Department of
Agriculture, Western Australia, informed me today that the Banana bunchy
top disease (BBTD) factsheet at their website below has errors regarding
the distribution of this disease. BBTD has not been recorded in Far North
Queensland (Australia), New Guinea, Papua New Guinea, or Irian Jaya. The
factsheet is being withdrawn immediately and the revised version will be
posted to the AQIS website when ready.

I thank Satendra Kumar for providing this information.
