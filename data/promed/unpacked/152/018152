Ebino-city: test started for proving FMD-free zone
---------------------------------------------------
The test to confirm the disease-free status, which will allow
releasing control area restrictions, was started on 24 May 2010 in
Ebino-city, where there were 4 cases of FMD (including suspected
cases).

It is almost one month since the 1st case was confirmed in Ebino-city.

"At last we can take the 1st step toward disease-free status," said,
with relief, a person involved. On the other hand, some livestock
farmers are not so optimistic. "It is too early to be happy, FMD-free
status in Ebino does not mean we are free from uncertainty," they
feel uneasy about FMD still spreading in Koyu District.

Tests for confirming that the area is FMD-free were continued on 25
[May 2010]. Miyazaki Prefectural Government conducted some physical
tests, collecting blood samples in 65 cattle farms in Ebino-city.

At present [25 May 2010] there is no report of abnormality and the
tests are conducted steadily. On 26 May [2010], the last day of the
tests, 29 farms including 7 swine farms will be tested.

The subjects of the series of tests, which aim at the release of
control area restrictions, are about 160 farms within 3 km [2 mi] of
the 1st case in Ebino. As for cattle, a maximum of 30 cattle per farm
(total 1340 cattle) will have their blood sampled for antibody
testing, and swine will be only physically tested by veterinarians.
It will take 7-10 days to obtain the results. If all tests art found
negative, Ebino-city will be released from control area at 0:00 a.m.
on 4 Jun 2010.

8.1 billion yen supplemental budget for FMD: Miyazaki Prefecture
----------------------------------------------------------------
The supplemental budget of approximately 8.1 billion yen [approx. USD
89 million] for supporting farmers with slaughtered animals will be
provided, Miyazaki Prefectural Government announced on 25 May 2010.

This budget will be presented to the extraordinary prefectural
assembly held on 28 May 2010. This is the 3rd supplemental budget for
this FMD outbreak, and the total amount will be 11.6 billion yen
[approx USD 129 million] if this is adopted.

Vaccination almost completed
----------------------------
FMD vaccination to all cattle and swine within 10 km [6 mi] of the
affected farms mainly in Kawaminami-cho is almost finished, the
Governmental FMD Control Headquarters in Miyazaki (Chief: Masahiko
Yamada, Deputy Minister of Agriculture) stated on 25 May 2010.
According to the source, approximately 98 percent of 145 000 animals
to be vaccinated, already received the vaccination.

The total number of farms that accepted the vaccination as of 24 May
2010 is 358 (302 cattle farms and 56 swine farms), with the total
number of animals being 94 587 (28 460 cattle, 66 103 swine, and 24
goats), Miyazaki Prefectural Government reported.

On 25 May 2010, 71 teams of veterinarians were engaged in vaccination
work from 8 o'clock in the morning in 2 cities and 5 towns such as
Miyazaki-city, Saito-city, and Kawaminami-cho.

[It will be interesting to note which vaccine strain has been
applied, the minimum age of the vaccinated animals, and the time
scheduled for the planned fate of the vaccinated animals. Are they to
be slaughtered for human consumption or to be destroyed? Is there any
change in the policy of "vaccinate to kill"?

This week, the OIE is holding its annual General Session in Paris,
where the participation of the representatives of 175 member
countries/territories (in most cases, their respective CVO's) and of
36 international and regional organisations is expected. It will not
surprise if the FMD outbreak in Japan will be one of the actual
topics reported and discussed. Until the recent outbreak, Japan was
included in the list of FMD-free countries without vaccination. -
