Mayor Bloomberg: Man exposed to anthrax in isolated incident
------------------------------------------------------------
Mayor Michael Bloomberg and other city officials are reassuring the
public there is no danger after a man of African descent was exposed
to anthrax in New York City. The man traveled recently to the west
coast of Africa and became ill after his return. A federal law
enforcement official told the Associated Press that the anthrax may
have been on animal skins he was importing.
Aides to the mayor said only the one man was injured and is
recovering in a hospital in Sayre, Pennsylvania. Federal and city
officials reportedly traced the exposure to New York City after the
man became ill there. Officials stressed that the case is NOT related
to any kind of terrorist attack.
Weeks after the 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and
the Pentagon, the nation was on high alert, as anthrax-laced letters
popped up in several places, including New York City. NBC anchor Tom
Brokaw, 2 American senators and the offices of the New York Post were
among the targets.
Contracting anthrax from rawhide is said to be a common threat among
ranchers. The CDC says that anthrax can be carried by cattle, sheep
and horses, and that other animals can be infected. They can get it
by breathing in spores from infected soil. In some cases, those
spores can live in the dirt for decades.
Animals that are infected are clearly sick within days, with signs
like weakness, staggering and trouble breathing. It's often fatal to
them within days.
The CDC says that while the disease does not usually spread between
animals, dead animals can be a point of infection. Federal rules
require that anthrax-infected carcasses be burned or buried in deep
pits, since moving them could further contaminate the ground or send
the bacteria into the air.

[From the ongoing news conference, it appears that the individual has
inhalation anthrax, confirmed by CDC, but he is doing well in a
hospital in Pennsylvania. 4 other individuals apparently exposed to
the same untreated animal hides are being evaluated, and the 3
evaluated so far (one is in transit) are well and are receiving
antimicrobial prophylaxis. The news conference also stated that the
man had visited the Cote d'Ivoire, West Africa, in December 2005. - Mod.LL]

Inhalation Anthrax Case in Pennsylvania
----------------------------------------
On 16 Feb 2006, a 44 year old male presented to a hospital in Pennsylvania
with respiratory symptoms including dry cough, shortness of breath and
general malaise. Laboratory Response Network (LRN) and Polymerase Chain
Reaction (PCR) on 21 Feb 2006 and gamma phage lysis on 22 Feb 2006 from blood
culture isolate were positive for _Bacillus anthracis_.
Patient resides in New York City and makes drums from unprocessed domestic and
imported (Africa) animal hides (cow and goat). Patient reports frequent travel
to Africa (most recent travel 12/4/05 [4 Dec 2005] & 12/21/05 [21 Dec 2005]).
Patient reports last work with animal hides on 15 Feb 2006. Process includes
cleaning and removal of hair from hides without chemical fixatives. While
traveling to Pennsylvania on 16 Feb 2006, the patient collapsed with rigors
and was transported and admitted to a small local hospital.
Patient transferred to a tertiary care center on 18 Feb 2006. Patient is
reported to be stable on antibiotic therapy in the ICU without mechanical
ventilation. No signs of cutaneous or pharyngeal anthrax lesions. Preliminary
clinical impression suggests anthrax sepsis secondary to inhalation route of
exposure due to spores from contaminated animal hides.
Ongoing investigation by PA and NYC departments of health in coordination
with law enforcement includes environmental assessment of patients
storage/work facility and home, and identification of individuals who may
have had contact with unprocessed hides.
Anthrax causes and transmission
-------------------------------
Anthrax is caused by exposure to _B. anthracis_, an encapsulated, aerobic,
gram-positive, spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium. Depending on the route
of infection, human anthrax can occur in 3 clinical forms: cutaneous,
inhalational, and gastrointestinal. Direct skin contact with contaminated
animal products can result in cutaneous anthrax. Inhalation of aerosolized
spores, such as through industrial processing of contaminated wool, hair, or
hides, can result in inhalational anthrax. Hemorrhagic meningitis can result
from hematogenous spread of the organism following any form of the disease.
The incubation period for anthrax is generally less than 2 weeks. However, due
to spore dormancy and slow clearance from the lungs, the incubation period for
inhalational anthrax may be prolonged. This phenomenon of delayed onset of
disease is not recognized to occur with cutaneous or gastrointestinal
exposures.
Skin/cutaneous anthrax
----------------------
Skin or cutaneous anthrax is the most common type of naturally-acquired
infection. Infection begins as a pruritic papule or vesicle that enlarges
and erodes (1-2 days) leaving a necrotic ulcer with subsequent formation of
a central black eschar (Images at
http://www.bt.cdc.gov/Agent/cutaneous.asp.)
The lesion is usually painless with surrounding edema, hyperemia, and regional
lymphadenopathy. Patients may have associated fever, malaise and headache.
Historically, the case-fatality rate for cutaneous anthrax has been less than
1 percent with antibiotic treatment and 20 percent without antibiotic
treatment. There are rare case reports of person-to-person transmission of
cutaneous disease.
See http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5042a1.htm#tab2 for specific
treatment of cutaneous anthrax.
Inhalational anthrax
--------------------
Inhalational anthrax is rare but is the most lethal form of the disease.
Disease may initially involve a prodrome of fever, chills, nonproductive
cough, chest pain, headache, myalgias, and malaise. However, more
distinctive clinical hallmarks include hemorrhagic mediastinal
lymphadenitis, hemorrhagic pleural effusions, bacteremia and toxemia
resulting in severe dyspnea, hypoxia and septic shock. Widened mediastinum
is the classic finding on imaging of the chest, but may initially be subtle
(Images at http://www.bt.cdc.gov/Agent/inhalational.asp and in the
appendices).
Case-fatality rates for inhalational anthrax are high, even with appropriate
antibiotics, and supportive care. Following the bioterrorist attack in fall
[autumn] 2001, the case-fatality rate among patients with inhalational disease
was 45 percent (5/11). Person-to person spread of inhalational anthrax has not
been documented.

[I think we can assume that this drum-maker brought a heavily contaminated
hide back with him from Africa and while handling it inhaled the bloody dirt
embedded in the hair. As he had collapsed before being diagnosed & treated he
is extraordinarily lucky, not just fortunate, in surviving. Frankly he should
be dead. Survival after symptoms have started can be rare. They had a positive
blood culture which indicates that treatment had not been started at the time
the blood sample was taken. The 2 hospitals are to be congratulated. It will
now be interesting to see what genomic strain is identified. - Mod.MHJ]
[One might speculate that the person who skinned the animal and the seller(s)
in Africa may have died undiagnosed. - Mod.JW]
