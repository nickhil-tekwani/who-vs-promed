Imports of EU poultry, soft drinks banned
------------------------------------------
RIYADH: Saudi Arabia has imposed a temporary ban on imports of soft
drinks and chicken products from the 15 European Union (EU) member
states for containing synthetic hormones harmful to humans, the
Ministry of Commerce said yesterday.
The official SPA news agency said Commerce Minister Osama Faqeeh
ordered the suspension on the basis of health reports indicating that
the products contained substances that cause cancer and impotence.
The ban covers all carbonated cold drinks and all chicken products.
Saudi Arabia also blacklisted 2 companies from Ireland and Belgium
for manufacturing banned industrial hormones.
Faqeeh said the ban was imposed in light of a Royal Decree, which
directed the authorities that precautionary measures be taken against
import of suspicious products dangerous to human health.
Informed sources told Arab News that no meat consignments will be
cleared unless accompanied by valid certificates of conformity. Meat
of animals fed by artificial fodder such as hormones, fat and animal
leftovers will not be allowed in, they added. Scientific tests have
disclosed that 15 EU countries including Belgium, Italy, Holland,
Germany, France, Spain and Ireland use steroid hormones as animal
fodder and in beverages. These hormones cause cancer and impotency.
Hussein Al-Adel, secretary-general of the Riyadh Chamber of Commerce
and Industry, told Arab News that measures would be taken to protect
the rights of Saudi importers if the consignments exported did not
comply with Saudi standards and did not have valid conformity
certificates.

Obviously this news item relates, mainly, to the MPA issue (see ref),
although according to previous publications, the only animal product
allegedly suspected to be contaminated with MPA was pork, the Saudi
media item relates to poultry. Since animal feed plants have been
involved, the Saudi approach makes sense: contamination of various
species cannot automatically be excluded.
The same news item also included references to various other food
safety issues with international trade impact, such as the nitrofen
issue in Germany, FMD and BSE (in chocolate!) in Europe. We have
found it appropriate to delete these irrelevant (FMD) or outdated
(nitrofen) data from the posting. - Mod.AS]
