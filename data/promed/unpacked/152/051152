Largest mumps outbreak in years spreads as more than 300 cases
diagnosed in New York suburbs
----------------------------------------------------------------------
More than 300 people have been diagnosed with mumps in suburban New
York as America's largest outbreak of the disease in years spreads.
Almost all the cases are among Orthodox Jews.

A health official says 303 people in the Rockland County towns of
Monsey and New Square have been diagnosed with the highly infectious disease.

Investigators say the outbreak started in August 2009 at a Jewish
summer camp in Sullivan County with an 11-year-old boy who brought
the disease from England. It has since spread to Jewish communities
in Brooklyn, New Jersey, and Orange County in upstate New York, [and
subsequently to Quebec province in Canada (see Mumps - USA (07): (NY)
20091220.4297) and to Jerusalem in Israel (see Mumps - Israel:
Yeshiva students, 2009 20100106.0059>. - Mod.CP]

Mumps is spread by coughing and sneezing with the most common
symptoms being fever, headache, and swollen salivary glands under the jaw.

[Stemming from an initial mumps outbreak at a summer camp for boys
from Orthodox Jewish communities, by the beginning of December 2009,
247 New York City residents plus 131 other state residents had
contracted the disease. The outbreak remains restricted mostly to
Jewish Orthodox adolescent boys in pockets of New York, New Jersey,
and Quebec (Canada), according to official reports from the New York
City and State Departments of Health. The number of confirmed cases
in New York has increased now to about 300.

Almost simultaneously an extensive outbreak of mumps is affecting
adolescent boys attending yeshiva schools in Israel. A number of the
Israeli patients reported contact with yeshiva students from the
United States (New York) who visited Israel during holidays in
mid-September 2009 and some of whom were reported to have recently
had mumps. It appears that the mumps virus responsible for this
outbreak originated in England (where mumps vaccination is less than
comprehensive) and has been transmitted through communities of mostly
adolescent boys in the USA, Canada, and Israel. These religious
communities in general are reluctant to accept vaccination.
