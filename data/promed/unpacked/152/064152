The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) is today (6 Mar 2015) closely monitoring an additional human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) on the Mainland, and again urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.

According to the Health and Family Planning Commission of Anhui Province, a male patient aged 79 with poultry exposure before onset was hospitalised for management in critical condition.

To date, 597 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been reported by the mainland health authorities in Guangdong (179 cases), Zhejiang (156 cases), Jiangsu (70 cases), Fujian (58 cases), Shanghai (45 cases), Hunan (24 cases), Anhui (24 cases), Xinjiang (10 cases), Jiangxi (9 cases), Shandong (6 cases), Beijing (5 cases), Henan (4 cases), Guangxi (3 cases), Jilin (2 cases), Guizhou (1 case) and Hebei (1 case).

[This brings the total cases, both from the mainland and imported cases (Hong Kong-13, Taiwan-4, Canada-2 and Malaysia-1) to other countries, to 617 since March 2013. - Mod.LK]

[2] China (Anhui): avian influenza H7N9 death
Date: Fri 06 Mar 2015

http://afludiary.blogspot.com/2015/03/anhui-province-reports-another-h7n9-case.html


On 23 Feb 2015, Ma'anshan City reported H7N9 avian flu in a patient with onset of 10 Feb 2015 (22 Feb 2015, Nanjing First Hospital diagnosed as H7N9 case ?). The treatment of the patient was ineffective and he died on 3 Mar 2015.

Currently there is evidence to suggest that exposure of humans to infection with H7N9 avian influenza from live bird markets is the source of the greatest risk. The virus is in poultry and their droppings and secretions. Residents in their daily lives should avoid direct contact with live poultry, birds or their droppings, especially diseased (dead) birds. In food processing, raw and cooked foods should be handled separately to avoid cross contamination. If there is contact, wash hands with soap or hand sanitizer as soon as possible; children should avoid direct contact with poultry and wild birds. If diseased (dead) birds are found, people should not deal with them on their own; they should be reported to the authorities. Do not buy live poultry freshly slaughtered, do not touch, do not eat sick (dead) poultry, meat, do not buy without quarantine certificates stating the birds are fresh, live, frozen poultry and their products; raw poultry, meat and eggs must be cooked. "A healthy lifestyle is very important for the prevention of the disease; usually physical exercise should be strengthened to ensure adequate sleep, [and one should eat a] balanced diet. Wash your hands, pay attention to personal hygiene."

[The problem is that the pathogenicity of A(H7N9) virus is significant to humans but low to poultry, highlighting the importance of effective and systematic surveillance.

From the CHP (http://www.chp.gov.hk/en/view_content/24244.html):

"The serious response level under the Government's Preparedness Plan for Influenza Pandemic is activated
-----------------------------------------------------
Avian influenza
---------------
Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks. Clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans includes eye infection (conjunctivitis), flu-like symptoms (for example, fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) or severe respiratory illness (for example, chest infection). The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days. The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and even death. People mainly become infected with avian influenza through close contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings. Human-to-human transmission is inefficient. People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian flu. The elderly, children and people with chronic illness have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infection. For details, please refer to factsheet of avian Influenza.

The public should remain vigilant and take heed of the advice against avian influenza below:
* Do not visit live poultry markets and farms. Avoid contact with poultry, birds and their droppings;
* If contact has been made, thoroughly wash hands with soap;
* Avoid entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered and contact with surfaces which might be contaminated by droppings of poultry or other animals;
* Poultry and eggs should be thoroughly cooked before eating;
* Wash hands frequently with soap, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, handling food or eating; after going to the toilet or touching public installations or equipment (including escalator handrails, elevator control panels and door knobs); and when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing;
* Cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing, hold the spit with a tissue and put it into a covered dustbin;
* Avoid crowded places and contact with fever patients; and
* Wear masks when respiratory symptoms develop or when taking care of fever patients."
