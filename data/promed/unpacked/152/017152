Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Outbreak in Iran
------------------------------------------------
TEHERAN: More than 100 Iranians have been infected with a [hemorrhagic
disease [virus, resulting in several deaths, the Head of the Iran's
Veterinary Organization said here on Sat 13 Oct 2001. Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), a common disease of humans and animals, has been
transferred via smuggled cattle from neighboring Afghanistan and Iraq over
the past 3 years, Ali-Safar Makanali, the head of Iran's border quarantines
said. He added that the epidemic has been tracked down in the central,
southeastern, and northwestern provinces of Isfahan, Sistan, Baluchestan,
Lorestan and West Azarbaijan.
The disease has entered the country despite intensive health care measures
implemented on the borders, Makanali said, adding that a difference in the
prices of livestock in Iran with that of the neighboring countries had led
to a rise in cattle smuggling. "About one to 2 million head of livestock
are annually smuggled into Iran through its borders," he said.
The possibility of fatalities in those infected with the Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever is 30 percent, Makanali said, adding that the virus is
spread by ticks from animal to humans or via patients' bodily fluids such
as urine or blood. The symptoms of CCHF are fever, with bleeding from the
nose, gums, and bowels and [blood in urine, the official said, adding that
it is transmitted through sheep, cows and camels. He said the Veterinary
Organization has been taking precautionary measures to check the spread of
the disease by insecticiding the contaminated regions. Some 40 quarantine
bases on the borders, 100 movable quarantine bases, and 39 hospitals have
been established in this effort.
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is endemic in parts of Pakistan,
Afghanistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, some of southern Europe, and most of
tropical and south Africa. The illness is seasonal, since the ticks emerge
in spring, live through the warmer months, and die out in winter. Health
experts say that although the symptoms of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
are similar to Ebola hemorrhagic fever, it doesn't spread as quickly, and
there is a significantly higher recovery rate.

[CCHF virus is a member of the genus _Nairovirus_ of the family
_Bunyaviridae_. Although classed as a Biosafety Level 4 Pathogen, it is not
related either antigenically, phylogentically, or epidemiologically to
Ebola fever virus (a filovirus). CCHF is a zoonotic disease, which is an
emerging problem with increasing numbers of cases reported each year from
many parts of the world. It is maintained by transovarial and transstadial
transmission in ticks and transmitted to humans via intermediate mammalian
hosts, viremic wild and domestic ruminants being the most dangerous.
Infection can be contracted also by direct contact with infected viremic
animals during shearing, slaughter, etc. Consequently the disease affects
primarily farmers, veterinarians, abattoir workers, and butchers. Likewise
the virus can be transmitted directly from human to human, usually in
hospital settings. Clinical disease is confined to humans. There is no
vaccine, and prevention is by vector control and by quarantine measures to
control the movement of infected domestic animals. The latter is difficult
to achieve in countries with long land borders, as exemplified by this
report. - Mod.CP
