[3] Egypt ex China, 1st confirmed case
Date: Fri 14 Feb 2020
Source: El Balad news [in Arabic, machine trans., edited]
https://www.elbalad.news/4174718


Today [14 Feb 2020], the Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population and the World Health Organization announced the discovery of the 1st positive case of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerging in the country in a "foreign" person.

Dr. Khaled Mujahid, advisor to the Minister of Health and Population for Media Affairs, and the official spokesperson for the ministry, said that the ministry succeeded in discovering the 1st case of a foreign person who was infected with the coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2], thanks to the preventive precaution plan implemented by the ministry by activating the electronic program to record and follow up with arrivals from countries where infections appeared. With the emerging coronavirus and through the preventive teams that follow them around the clock, indicating that laboratory tests were conducted for the suspected case, which resulted in a positive virus, but without any symptoms.

Mujahid added that the WHO was immediately informed, and all preventive measures were taken in cooperation with the WHO: the case was transferred to a self-sterilized ambulance to the hospital for isolation, follow-up, and reassurance, explaining that the case is [SARS-CoV-2]-positive and shows no symptoms, and its condition is completely stable.

He said that the ministry has taken strict preventive measures against those in contact with the case by conducting the necessary analyzes that were negative for the coronavirus, and they were self-isolated in their places of residence as a precautionary measure for a 14-day period ("incubation period of the disease"), pointing to their follow-up periodically every 8 hours and giving them health instructions to be followed, as well as the building in which the case was staying and who was in contact with it was sterilized.

In this regard, Dr. John Gabor, the representative of the WHO in Egypt, praised the speed and transparency of the Egyptian government in dealing with the situation, and its keenness to inform the organization of the case as soon as it was suspected, praising the preventive measures taken by the Ministry of Health and Population regarding the discovered case and those who are in contact with it.

Gabor stressed that Egypt is one of the 1st countries to develop a good preventive plan to address the emerging coronavirus and how to deal with infected cases once they are discovered.

The Minister of Health and Population also held today, Friday [14 Feb 2020], an expanded meeting with the leadership of the ministry in the ministry's public office to follow up with implementation of the ministry's plan to address and deal with the emerging corona virus, stressing that all preventive measures are taken in the country's ports.

The Minister of Health and Population is following the 24-hour Crisis Management Chamber, which includes representatives from all ministries and relevant authorities, at the ministry's general office to follow up on the situation of the coronavirus emerging inside the country and the ministry's preventive plan in the ports and all health directorates in the Republic, stressing to raise the levels of readiness to the utmost in all ports and airports nationwide.

[4] USA to use flu monitoring system

CDC: Flu surveillance system enlisted in hunt for COVID-19 cases
-------------------------------------
As a way to spot any community COVID-19 activity early, federal health officials will use the nation's flu surveillance system to look for people who may be infected with the disease. US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar 1st unveiled the plan yesterday [Thu 13 Feb 2020]. Its 1st phase will be launched at public health labs that are part of the flu surveillance system in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, and New York City.

At a media briefing today [14 Feb 2020], Nancy Messonnier, MD, who directs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said surveillance at those 5 sites is just a starting point and that COVID-19 surveillance will expand nationally in the coming weeks. "This is an efficient way for us to stand up surveillance," she said.

Though the goal is still to contain the virus, global health officials worry that it may be already circulating undetected in countries outside China. For now, all 15 cases in the United States have been linked to Hubei province travelers or their close contacts, but Messonnier said the pattern could change, and federal health officials want to be prepared. The initial US plan to detect community spread hinges on public health lab workers testing samples that are negative for flu for the virus that causes COVID-19. She said any positive tests would be a warning signal that would drive a change in public health strategy.

Messonnier said the CDC has the resources it needs to respond to and prepare for COVID-19. She expressed gratitude to Congress for earlier investments that built the flu surveillance system that health officials are now leaning on to watch for an outbreak of the new respiratory disease. And she said rapid-response funding has been a game changer: "Right now, funding hasn't been a constraint."

Testing protocol change for evacuees
Also today [Fri 14 Feb 2020], Messonnier explained a change in testing for quarantined evacuees. The initial group of 195 people were tested for the virus, but since then, she said, the CDC has learned more about how the virus behaves in people. About 600 people are still in quarantine, and the CDC will now limit testing to people with a history of exposure who have symptoms. She said testing people too early may result in a negative test that could provide a false sense of security. Messonnier emphasized that the worry isn't about false negative results, but rather that virus levels haven't risen enough to become detectable.

Evacuees have their temperatures taken twice a day, and health officials continuously monitor their symptoms.

[5] Selected media reports of transmission outside of mainland China
A. Japanese cruise ship
Date: Fri 14 Feb 2020 11:19 AM JST
Source: Japan Times [edited]
https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/02/14/national/japan-clear-coronavirus-cruise-ship/#.XkdGSzFKg2w


Over the next 5 days, Japan faces the daunting task of testing thousands of passengers aboard a quarantined cruise ship, evacuating them and transporting those who test positive for the coronavirus -- or who may have come in contact with someone who has -- to medical facilities on shore.

With the health ministry yet to announce a plan to address these issues or to extend the quarantine, which is scheduled to end Wednesday [19 Feb 2020], the task of getting everyone off the Diamond Princess by the deadline grows increasingly improbable.

The whole situation is like "a game with no end in sight," said Koji Wada, a professor of public health at the International University of Health and Welfare. As the time limit gets closer, the question now is whether it's possible to send everyone home in time," he said. "It's entirely possible that not all passengers will be evacuated by the end of the quarantine period."

So far, those infected with COVID-19 start to show symptoms anywhere between 2 and 14 days after contracting the virus. Thus a 2-week quarantine was placed upon the cruise ship, which was carrying more than 3700 passengers and crew, after an 80-year-old man who left the ship in Hong Kong tested positive for the virus.

But if secondary infections are occurring on the ship, as many experts suspect, the 14-day quarantine -- which began on [5 Feb 2020] when the Diamond Princess arrived at Yokohama Bay -- will prove meaningless. Still, the health ministry has not officially changed its plan to end the quarantine on [19 Feb 2020] nor explained to the public what strategies it will take to contain the outbreak after the deadline.

"The cruise ship is almost completely infested," Wada said. "The world is watching Japan," he continued, adding that Japan is the only country in the world -- besides China -- that has had to deal with so many coronavirus patients all at once. He said that, depending on the outcome, Tokyo's response could serve as a model for other countries struggling to contain the outbreak.

The ship made port in Yokohama Bay last week following a 16-day cruise that included stops in Japan, Hong Kong, Viet Nam, and Taiwan. A total of 2666 passengers, including those staying in small, windowless rooms, were asked to stay inside their compartments to prevent transmission during the quarantine period. Since then, 218 passengers and crew members have tested positive, as well as one of the quarantine officers administering the tests.

On Friday [14 Feb 2020], high-risk passengers 80 or older who tested negative for COVID-19 were allowed to disembark amid growing concerns over the physical and mental conditions of those aboard. The elderly passengers were transported by bus to a government facility in Wako, Saitama prefecture.

The central government has called on doctors, academics, and other experts to help devise a plan to safely and securely evacuate the Diamond Princess. Wada is part of this collaborative effort. He raised the idea of using tents near Yokohama Bay as a preliminary testing ground for the passengers. Moving forward, he added, the government needs to put forth a plan that lays out how all passengers and crew will be evacuated, tested, and treated, all while containing the virus.

Further doubt was cast upon efforts to evacuate the Diamond Princess by Shigeru Omi, president of the Japan Community Healthcare Organization and former regional director of the World Health Organization's Western Pacific Regional Office, during a news conference on Thursday [13 Feb 2020]. Omi, who served as WHO regional director during the 2002-2003 outbreak of SARS, questioned the reliability of the test results and the ability of onshore medical facilities to accept coronavirus patients. "The tests aren't necessarily picking up the virus 100% of the time," he said. "And if coronavirus patients are taken to a local hospital, where should the patients who were already there go? How do we know the medical staff are prepared for these circumstances?"

The Diamond Princess was quarantined by the government in an attempt to contain the novel coronavirus and prevent a domestic epidemic. However, reports of new cases of infection aboard the ship continue to emerge almost daily, and passengers seem to be growing weary as the quarantine continues. Omi pointed out that quarantine periods typically reset every time an additional case is reported.

Health minister Katsunobu Kato said on Wednesday [12 Feb 2020] that he wants to test everyone aboard the ship, but the lack of testing kits and logistical difficulties are complicating matters. As of Wednesday [12 Feb 2020], 492 samples had been collected, but that figure includes specimens collected from the same people more than once. "Keeping the passengers in a place with such high risk of infection is questionable, not only from a virus prevention standpoint, but ethically as well," Omi said. "We need to move quickly to get them off the ship as soon as possible."

Meanwhile on Friday [14 Feb 2020], a female taxi driver in Okinawa was confirmed to be infected with the novel coronavirus, the 1st patient in the prefecture. She was among about 200 people in the prefecture being monitored by the Okinawa government who had close contact with passengers on the Diamond Princess when the ship made port in Naha during its trip.

On Friday [14 Feb 2020], at the request of the health ministry, SoftBank delivered iPhones preloaded with medical advice to passengers aboard the Diamond Princess.

[While there is much discussion about the passengers on the ship, the discussions re: the crew have been limited. To date there have been at least 10 cases confirmed among crew on the ship, individuals who sleep in dormitory-like quarters with multiple individuals in the same room. Many of these individuals have been interfacing with the passengers, potentially serving as 2-way transmission streams if use of PPE (personal protective equipment) isn't completely observed. Interestingly there have not been reports of additional cases confirmed in the past 24 hours, but is this a function of the volume of specimens tested, or does it reflect no newly confirmed cases?

As for the passengers with confirmed COVID-19, an age distribution of the passengers was provided by ProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka from media reports in Japanese:
20-29: 10
30-39: 7
40-49: 7
50-59: 20
60-69: 50
70-79: 73

Japan saw several new cases of coronavirus infection reported on Friday [14 Feb 2020], leading health officials to try and establish just how they contracted the virus. The latest cases bring the number of infected people in Japan to 259, including 218 from a cruise ship. Two people are residents of Tokyo. They likely had contact with a taxi driver who was confirmed to be infected on Thursday [13 Feb 2020]. The driver's mother-in-law was the 1st infected person to die in Japan.

Another taxi driver in the southern prefecture of Okinawa also has the virus. She drove 4 passengers from the now-quarantined cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, when it made a stop earlier this month [February 2020]. The governor of Okinawa says officials there are responding to the latest developments. Governor Denny Tamaki said, "2679 people possibly disembarked in Okinawa. We've been checking up on about 200 people who may have come into contact with them. These checks will continue until Saturday [15 Feb 2020], to cover the incubation period."

A man in his 70s in the western prefecture of Wakayama has also tested positive. He had temporarily stayed at a hospital where a surgeon was confirmed to be infected on Thursday [13 Feb 2020].

The northern prefecture of Hokkaido reported its 2nd case.

A man in Aichi prefecture, central Japan, has now been confirmed to have the virus.

And a local government official in Kanagawa prefecture, bordering Tokyo, has tested positive. He was engaged in transporting infected people from the Diamond Princess to hospitals earlier this week.

Meanwhile, 11 infected people from the ship are in serious condition.

713 people on board have been checked for the virus, with 218 testing positive. They have either been taken to hospitals or are in the process of being transferred.

Roughly 3400 passengers and crew remain onboard. The health ministry is asking them to stay in their rooms until next Wednesday [19 Feb 2020], which will mark the end of a 2-week quarantine period.

[In the above description of cases, most can be connected to contact with persons previously confirmed as infected, or in the case of Okinawa, retrospectively confirmed passengers from the cruise ship currently in quarantine off Yokahama. The challenging cases for identifying the chain of transmission include the doctor in Wakayama, the cases in Hokkaido, and the man in Aichi prefecture. We await more information on results of epidemiologic investigations.

C. Japan, case ill while in Hawaii

https://www.kitv.com/story/41705534/japanese-visitor-recently-in-hawaii-confirmed-to-have-coronavirus?utm_medium=social


An adult male traveler that had been through Hawaii has now been confirmed to have the coronavirus. He was in Hawaii from [28 Jan 2020] through [7 Feb 2020]. When he returned to Japan, he was confirmed to have contracted the coronavirus. The state is in contact with the Japanese government.

The Department of Health (DOH) was notified this morning by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that the visitor went to Maui before he traveled to O'ahu [3-7 Feb 2020].

During his time on Maui, [the traveler] showed no symptoms. However, during the time he spent on O'ahu, he had cold symptoms, with no fever.

The visitor stayed in Waikiki at the Hilton Grand Vacation with his wife. Officials believe he was infected while he was in Japan or while traveling.

The focus now is to try and understand who the Japanese visitor had close contact with. Once they can identify who those people are, they will monitor them or quarantine them.

[The challenge facing the global efforts to interrupt transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 is that the coronavirus infections frequently present clinically as a common cold, a presentation that doesn't lead to seeking out health services in the majority of times. If the symptoms remain mild, these individuals are out in the community and do not usually self-quarantine or isolate frequently. We await results of investigations into where this individual may have been exposed to the coronavirus. - Mod.MPP]

The WHO R&D Blueprint is a global strategy and preparedness plan that allows the rapid activation of research and development activities during epidemics. Its aim is to fast-track the availability of effective tests, vaccines, and medicines that can be used to save lives and avert further crisis.

In view of the urgency of the COVID-19 outbreak, the international community is mobilizing to find ways to significantly accelerate the development of interventions including vaccines and therapeutics. Nearly 400 world scientists met at WHO's Geneva Headquarters from 11-12 Feb 2020 to assess the current level of knowledge about the new COVID-19 virus, agree on critical research questions that need to be answered urgently, and identify ways to work together to accelerate and fund priority research that can contribute to curtail this outbreak and prepare for future outbreaks. The meeting was organized by WHO, in collaboration with the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness.

Research topics discussed included: COVID-19 virus natural history, transmission and diagnostics; animal and environmental research on the virus origin; management measures at the human-animal interface; epidemiological studies; clinical characterization and management; infection prevention and control, including healthcare workers' protection; candidate therapeutics R&D; candidate vaccines R&D; ethical considerations for research; and integrating social sciences in the outbreak response.

Experts identified key knowledge gaps and research priorities, and shared scientific data on ongoing research, thereby accelerating the generation of critical scientific information to contribute to the control the COVID-19 outbreak. There was broad consensus on the need for research to focus on actions that can save lives now to ensure that those affected are promptly diagnosed and receive optimal care. 8 immediate research priorities were agreed as part of this forum:

1. Mobilize research on rapid point-of-care diagnostics for use at the community level;

2. Assess available data to learn what standard of care approaches from China and elsewhere are the most effective;

3. Evaluate as fast as possible the effect of adjunctive (given in addition to the main treatment) and supportive therapies;

4. Optimize the use of protective equipment and other infection prevention and control measures in healthcare and community settings;

5. Review all available evidence to identify animal host(s), prevent continued spill-over, and better understand virus transmissibility in different contexts over time, the severity of disease, and individuals more susceptible to infection;

6. Accelerate the evaluation of investigational therapeutics and vaccines by using "Master Protocols";

7. Maintain a high degree of communication and interaction among funders so that critical research is implemented; and

8. Broadly and rapidly share virus materials, clinical samples, and data for immediate public health purposes.

[[The number of countries reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 with transmission occurring outside China remains 12 (Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Viet Nam, Malaysia, Thailand, USA, France, Germany, Spain, UK, and UAE). There has also been local transmission noted on the cruise ship quarantined in Japan related to a quarantine officer.

New confirmatory information contained in this update includes showing the number of laboratory-confirmed cases in China in addition to showing the clinically confirmed cases, in keeping with change in reporting criteria implemented in Hubei province. Thus, while the numbers of "confirmed cases" in China yesterday [13 Feb 2020] increased by an additional 15 384, the number of laboratory-confirmed cases increased by 1998 from that reported in the WHO update on 13 Feb 2020. Unfortunately, there isn't a delineation of fatalities to know how many of the newly reported fatalities were laboratory-confirmed cases.

Another piece of newly confirmed data includes information that there have been a total of 1716 laboratory-confirmed cases in healthcare workers including 6 fatalities in China. With a total number of laboratory-confirmed cases as of today, 14 Feb 2020, at 48 548, the proportion of cases among healthcare workers is 3.5%, significantly lower than seen with the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002-2003, when there were 1725 cases among healthcare workers out of 8422 cases (20.5%).
