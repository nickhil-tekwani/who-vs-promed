Food laced with rat poison killed one and sent 24 to the hospital during a
wedding party in east China's Jiangsu province, state media said on Friday.
The mass poisoning happened on Thursday in Sihong county, as several guests
started feeling sick shortly after the wedding banquet had started, the
Xinhua news agency reported.
One died on the way to hospital, and another remained in critical condition
on Friday, according to the agency.
Police are investigating after it was determined the culprit was a
particularly dangerous brand of rat poison which is now banned throughout
China.

[This piece was submitted by Eric Croddy in response to the earlier posting
on food poisoning in China (Food poisoning, children - China (Hunan, Hubei)
20031114.2822). As it discusses the use of rodenticides as a possible
agent, and this current posting deals with intentional food poisoning
through the use of rodenticides, we have decided to include this in this
current posting. - Mod.MPP]

Hardly scientific, but rat poison may not be too far off form the mark.. It
has very short latency, something on the order of 1 hour, sometimes less
after ingestion.
Please see "Rat poison and food security in the Peoples Republic of China:
focus on tetramethylene disulfotetramine (tetramine)," Archives of
Toxicology: Published online: 9 Oct 2003
Abstract:
"The last several years have seen a large number of mass poisonings in
mainland China, particularly those caused by illicit rodenticides. One rat
poison, tetramine (tetramethylene disulfotetramine) is responsible for a
great percentage of death and injury in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC).
Tetramine is an acutely toxic substance with human oral toxicity estimated
as low as 0.1 mg/kg, and is widely available in open markets in mainland
China, this despite being prohibited for manufacture or sale in the PRC.
Being a GABA antagonist, and having an extremely potent effect on the brain
stem, many victims can quickly fall into convulsions and die within hours
following ingestion.
With no known effective antidote at this time, clinical data from the PRC
show that acute cases of tetramine poisoning are extremely difficult to
treat. The widespread use of tetramine including its reported sale at a
Malaysian outdoor market in September 2002 could exacerbate its hazard to
public health, particularly in those areas having large overseas Chinese
populations."
