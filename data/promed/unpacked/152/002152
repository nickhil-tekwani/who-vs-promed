THE COMING PLAGUE: TV DOCUMENTARY: ORDERING INFORMATION
=======================================================
Date: Mon, 21 Apr 1997 14:55:55 -0400
From: Phyllis Williams <pwilliam@sinclair.edu>

There are two ways to order the Coming Plague:
1. Call 1-800-887-3737 for a phone order. The video costs $29.98 plus
$5.95 shipping.
2. If you order by a Purchase Order, send it to:
Warner Home Videos, 8240 Rhonda Dr., Canton, MI 48187.
I watched the first installment last night and called this morning to get
this information.

[Many thanks, Phyllis. We don't normally plug TV documentaries, but offer
in extenuation the following circumstances: the subject is of special
interest to our subscribers, and 10 years ago Ted Turner of TBS gave seed
money to help establish SatelLife, which carries our e-mail to literally
the ends of the earth.
BTW, I was hoping we'd get some feedback from viewers -- good? bad? too
sensational?
