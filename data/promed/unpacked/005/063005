The article contains the statement: "Unlike SARS-CoV-2, the number of MERS-CoV cases has been very low, because the infection has shown weak transmission characteristics for humans at 1st contact and has not presented human-to-human transmission." This may be referring to the local situation in Turkey, but it sounds as if lack of human-to-human transmission is a generality, and the significant outbreak in South Korea from one index patient proves that this is not, in general, the case. Human-to-human transmission of this entity should be greatly feared and vigorously mitigated through PPE.

[ProMED included, at the end of the moderator's comment in the addressed posting: "Observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV has occurred mainly in health-care settings. Human-to-human transmission can be stopped with adequate infection prevention and control measures." We are grateful to Dr Herrick for his comment, allowing elaboration by presenting the following WHO assessment [abridged, references omitted] on the issue:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"No sustained human-to-human transmission has been reported anywhere in the world; however, limited, nonsustained human-to-human transmission in health-care facilities remains a prominent feature of the epidemiology of MERS. To date, 83% of all human infections reported to WHO were in Saudi Arabia. Cases have been reported from 27 countries, comprising Bahrain, Egypt, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen in the Middle East; Algeria and Tunisia in Africa; Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey, and the United Kingdom in Europe; China, Malaysia, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, and Thailand in Asia; and the USA in the Americas."

"Outside health-care facilities, populations in close contact with dromedaries (e.g., farmers, abattoir workers, shepherds, dromedary owners) and health-care workers who care for MERS-CoV patients are at higher risk of infection. Healthy adults infected with MERS-CoV tend to have mild subclinical or asymptomatic infections, and, to date, human-to-human transmission among close contacts of confirmed cases in households has been limited.

"Health-care-associated transmission has been documented in France, Jordan, the Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom, with outbreaks of various sizes (2-186 reported cases per outbreak). The largest outbreak outside the Middle East occurred in the Republic of Korea in 2015, which resulted in 186 cases (including one case in a person who had travelled to China) and 39 deaths.

"Since 2015, health authorities in affected countries investigate cases more systematically, with testing for MERS-CoV among symptomatic and asymptomatic high-risk contacts, and applying infection measures to stop human-to-human transmission in health-care settings. A recent analysis by WHO and colleagues from the University of Oxford, Imperial College London, and the Institut Pasteur indicated that, since 2016, 1465 cases of MERS-CoV and 300-500 deaths may have been averted by accelerated global work to detect infections early and to reduce transmission.

"Reduced human-to human transmission is most probably the result of improved infection prevention and control measures."

"Secondary cases have been reported to have had various levels of contact with confirmed patients, from direct contact (e.g., health-care workers providing direct care to infected patients before diagnosis of MERS) to no clear contact (e.g., patients who shared wards with infected patients but who did not share health-care workers or rooms). MERS-CoV has been found on surfaces inside patients' rooms and on equipment during hospital stays and after discharge or death. These findings highlight the importance of adequate cleaning and disinfection of hospital rooms."

The article in question addressed MERS-CoV serology in camels. The authors' remark, "planning a seroepidemiological research on individuals who are in close contact with camels would make significant contribution for displaying the epidemiology of this infection in Turkey," deserves to be supported. - Mod.AS
