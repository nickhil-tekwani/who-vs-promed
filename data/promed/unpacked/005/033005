Cases of a potentially deadly bloodstream infection spiked in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde [NHS GGC] last summer [2019], months after a rare strain of the bacteria claimed 3 babies' lives.

Health Protection Scotland said the above average rate of _Staphylococcus aureus_ bacteraemia (SAB) which affected patients treated in hospital between July and September last year [2019] "needs to be looked at further". A total of 93 healthcare-associated cases of SAB were recorded across the health board during the 3 month period [July, August and September 2019]. These were cases linked to the hospital environment - such as contaminated intravenous devices - and not contracted in the community. The incidence rate for the infection in NHS GGC - measured by the number of cases per occupied bed days - was 27% higher than the average for Scotland.

NHS GGC was the only health board in Scotland with above average rates during this 3-month period, although NHS Grampian was also flagged up by the watchdog over an unusual number of hospital-acquired _E.coli_ cases.

_Staphylococcus aureus_ is one of the most common causes of hospital-acquired infections. The bacterium is routinely found on the skin and in the nasal passage of about one in four healthy people. It is usually harmless, but occasionally causes skin rashes or sores and, in the most serious cases, enters the bloodstream where it can cause a life-threatening infection - especially in patients with weakened immune systems. One of the most dangerous forms is resistant to the antibiotic, methicillin, and is better known as MRSA (methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_).

In January 2019 it emerged that 2 extremely premature babies had died at the Princess Royal Maternity Hospital in Glasgow after contracting a rare strain of SAB. In April [2019], the same infection was linked to the death of a 3rd infant at the maternity unit. At the time NHS GGC said all 3 babies "were extremely poorly due to their very early birth" and that the infection had been "one of a number of contributing causes in their deaths". The infections were caused by a type 11164 strain of SAB, previously only ever seen in China and Germany. The strain was highly resistant to the 2 antibiotics that are normally prescribed to combat _Staphylococcus aureus_, and was also resistant to the skin cleaning agent routinely used in hospitals across the UK to kill the bacteria.

Dr Jennifer Armstrong, NHS GGC's medical director described it as "a challenging infection to bring under control", and said in March 2019 that all parents, staff, visitors and babies who entered the maternity unit would be screened for the bacteria "until we are absolutely certain that it is out of our hospitals".

It is unknown whether any of the cases reported to Health Protection Scotland last summer [2019] were of the same 11164 strain.

In the 12 months to the end of September 2019, a total of 345 hospital-acquired cases of SAB were recorded across the Greater Glasgow and Clyde region, similar to the 340 recorded in the previous year [2018]. There is no data to indicate how many of these were fatal, but a spokesman for NHS GGC said internal monitoring of the situation had shown a recent decline in SAB cases. He said: "The safety of our patients is at the centre of all that we do which is why we have been closely monitoring the number of infections. We have taken a number of steps to reduce instances of healthcare associated infections relating to SAB since the noted increase in Q3 of 2019. Our most up to date local surveillance indicates an overall reduction of 26% in the number of such cases in the latest quarter compared to Q3 of the same year [2019]. One of the single biggest contributors to SAB infections was recognised as coming from instances where patients have intravenous devices in place. Following significant local quality improvement work, we have seen a 50% decrease in those occurrences, compared to the previous quarter. Work continues across NHS GGC acute hospitals to ensure the reduction in healthcare associated infection SAB cases thought to be caused by these devices, is sustained."

Meanwhile, Health Protection Scotland also said that a higher than average rate of hospital-acquired _E. coli_ cases in NHS Grampian also "needs to be looked at further". Between July and September 2019, there were 74 patient cases traced to the healthcare environment. The rate was 39% higher than the Scottish average. A spokeswoman for NHS Grampian said: "We are aware and acknowledge the data. This is being investigated locally. More recent results are within normal baseline levels."

[The news report above says that 93 healthcare-associated cases of _Staphylococcus aureus_ bacteremia (SAB) occurred at hospitals in the NHS Greater Glasgow Clyde region during the July, August and September, 2019. Many of these cases of SAB were linked to contaminated intravenous devices. Following the introduction of unspecified control measures, a 26% reduction was seen in the total number of SAB cases in the last quarter of 2019, compared to 3rd quarter, and a 50% reduction was seen in SAB cases linked to indwelling intravenous devices. We are not told the hospitals involved, the location of cases within the hospitals, linkage of cases, the molecular characteristics of the _S. aureus_ strains involved or their susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

ProMED-mail previously posted a report of the nosocomial cluster of 3 cases of _Staphylococcus aureus_ bacteremia (SAB) over a short period in the neonatal unit of Prince Royal Maternity Hospital in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde region in Jan 2019 that suggested a common environmental source. Although the 3 cases were said to be "linked," we were not told the nature of this linkage. However, the above news report says that these 3 cases were caused by "type 11164 strain of SAB, previously only ever seen in China and Germany" and "it is unknown whether any of the [93] cases reported to Health Protection Scotland last summer [in Jul, Aug, and Sep 2019] were of the same 11164 strain."

_S. aureus_ is a common healthcare-associated pathogen and bacteremia due to _S. aureus_ is a life-threatening infection. The presence of an indwelling venous catheter is an important risk factor, for example in patients undergoing hemodialysis, and patients in intensive care units.

Molecular typing of _S. aureus_ by 1) pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), 2) multilocus sequencing (MLST), that is, DNA sequencing of internal fragments of multiple housekeeping genes, 3) spa typing, that is, DNA sequencing of staphylococcal protein A gene variable repeat region, and 4) staphylococcal cassette chromosome _mec_ (SCC_mec_) typing are commonly used to characterize methicillin-resistant _S. aureus_ (MRSA) isolates.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classifies MRSA isolates based on the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns (for example, USA100-1200) (McDougal LK, Steward CD, Killgore GE, Chaitram JM, McAllister SK, Tenover FC. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing of oxacillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ isolates from the United States: Establishing a national database. J Clin Microbiol. 2003; 41(11): 5113-20; available at http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/content/full/41/11/5113). USA300 causes most community-associated MRSA infections and has become increasingly a cause of health care-associated MRSA infections in the United States (Tenover FC, Goering RV: Methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ strain USA300: origin and epidemiology. J Antimicrob Chemother 2009; 64(3): 441-6; available at https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/64/3/441/776075). USA100 are multidrug-resistant strains of MRSA that are typically associated with healthcare-acquired infections.

Surfaces in the hospital environment, such as bed curtains, furniture, and hospital equipment, contaminated by _S. aureus_ represent important reservoirs for these organisms. Indwelling vascular or endotracheal catheters can become contaminated. Contaminated intravenous or enteral solutions could also be a possible source for a nosocomial outbreak. Patients can become colonized or develop infections, such as bacteremia, pneumonia (especially ventilator-associated pneumonia), traumatic and surgical wound infections, bone and joint infections, prosthetic device infections, urinary tract infections, meningitis, and infective endocarditis. _S. aureus_ are spread most commonly on the hands of hospital personnel from the contaminated environment or from other patients who are either infected or colonized with these organisms. - Mod.ML
