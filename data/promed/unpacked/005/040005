[The outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis included in these updates have the
characteristics of "winter vomiting disease", and are presumed to be caused
by Norwalk-like viruses (i.e., caliciviruses classified in the genus
_Norovirus_), although this is rarely confirmed microbiologically. The UK
and Ireland seem to be particularly prone at present to outbreaks of
"winter-vomiting" disease in institutional settings. - Mod.CP]

England: 4 Wards closed at Hospital in Huntingdon
--------------------------------------------------
More than a week after an outbreak of winter vomiting disease, 4 wards
remain closed at Hinchingbrooke Hospital in Huntingdon. This illness
particularly attacks hospital patients whose resistance is low. At the
start of last week, 2 medical wards were originally shut, but this soon
rose to 4. Children, elderly people, and pregnant women were being advised
not to go to the hospital, except in an emergency. On Tuesday morning a
spokeswoman for Hinchingbrooke Hospital said the situation was now improving.
Each ward needs to be isolated for 48 hours after the last episode.
Inpatient capacity manager Rachel Watt said the hospital was now hoping to
reopen 2 of the wards within the next 24 hours. Friends and relatives of
patients are being advised to check with the hospital before visiting.
Meanwhile, across the rest of the region the families of patients at
Kettering General Hospital and Milton Keynes General Hospital are still
being asked to avoid visits. The virus is still keeping several wards
closed at these hospitals.

England: Norwalk Virus Outbreak at Hospital in Reading
-------------------------------------------------
Operations have been cancelled at the Royal Berkshire Hospital [Reading],
following an outbreak of [an infectious agent] causing severe stomach
upsets and vomiting; 80 staff members and 65 patients have been taken ill
with the highly contagious Norwalk virus. All non-urgent surgery at the
Reading hospital has now been postponed. In total, 17 wards have been
affected by the virus and 4 have been closed to new admissions.
The airborne [virus] causes sickness and diarrhoea for between 24 and 48
hours, but is not life-threatening. Cases of Norwalk virus infection were
first detected in Reading a week ago and the numbers have risen steadily.
With so many staff members taken ill at the hospital, rotas have had to be
re-organized and the accident and emergency department has been left
short-staffed. Patients affected by the virus have been segregated into
side rooms, to try to minimize the spread of the virus to other wards.
Royal Berkshire Hospital spokeswoman Laura O'Connor said: "We want to get
across to the public not to panic. "The outpatient unit is still open,
where it is business as usual.
Several hospitals across the south have been hit by the illness already
this year. In September 2002 hospitals in Hampshire and Dorset suffered
major outbreaks. The illness is similar to the so-called "winter vomiting
[disease]" that swept the UK last year.

England: Norwalk Virus Outbreak Affects Royal Bournemouth Hospital Again
--------------------------------------------------
The winter vomiting virus has struck the Royal Bournemouth Hospital again.
In the latest outbreak, 27 patients and 3 staff members have been affected
by Norwalk virus. Currently 4 wards are closed to new admissions and staff
have reinforced infection control measures to combat the diarrhoea and
sickness [virus]. The outbreak, which took hold early this week, has meant
people suffering from non-urgent conditions are being urged not to attend
accident and emergency. The latest cases in Bournemouth come after other
numerous outbreaks across the south during the last month.
Meanwhile, officials at the Royal Berkshire Hospital (in Reading - see [2]
above) say they are coping with the infection despite 145 staff and
patients having fallen ill. So far 17 wards have been affected, with some
restrictions placed on new admissions and visitors. The town's Battle
Hospital remains clear. The airborne virus causes sickness and diarrhoea
for between 24 and 48 hours but is not life-threatening.

Scotland: Outbreak of Winter Vomiting Illness at East Kilbride Hospital
--------------------------------------------------
More than 50 people have been struck down by the "winter vomiting" virus
after an outbreak at Hairmyres Hospital in East Kilbride, Lanarkshire. A
total of 21 patients and 32 staff are known to have been affected by the
outbreak. The condition of 5 elderly patients was said last night to be
giving staff cause for concern.
Now 2 elderly rehabilitation wards have been closed to new admissions as a
result of the outbreak, thought to be a "Norwalk-like" virus which can
cause gastroenteritis. Doctors said patients first started showing signs of
the virus on Wed 23 Oct 2002. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea,
and stomach cramps.
Dr John Logan, consultant in public health medicine at Lanarkshire Health
Board, said it was important to maintain high levels of personal hygiene to
avoid infection. He also warned that it was possible for the virus to
spread quickly in large institutions such as hospitals. Dr Logan said:
"This infection is sometimes known as the winter vomiting virus and is
currently present within the general Lanarkshire community and in other
parts of Scotland."
