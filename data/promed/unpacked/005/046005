West Nile Virus Transmission: Information on Pathogenesis?
----------------------------------------------------------
I would think that a simple pathogenesis study would be of considerable
importance in looking at these issues, if it has not already been done. The
usual "grind and find" plus clinical observations plus immunhistochemical
studies to identify the sites of replication would give a basis for
interpreting the epidemiological studies. Of course the experimenters would
give particular attention to throat swab, cloacal swab, feather follicles as
sources of infectious virus.

West Nile Virus Transmission: Ingestion?
-----------------------------------------
The ingestion of contaminated material (i.e. crows feeding on infected
nestlings of other species, the "bad oyster" theory) had been earlier
suggested as a route of entry for the virus in crows. Has any work been done
to determine what is a lethal oral dose of the virus? The entry of virus
into a bird's system by mechanical means is known in pheasant flocks, but is
stepping in "virally contaminated feces" (a real or supposed phenomenon?)
really analogous to the pecking that goes on in pheasant flocks?

West Nile Virus Transmission: Fecal Excretion
---------------------------------------------
In reference to the recent press release by Dr. McClean concerning
experimental West Nile virus in crows, it should be noted that West Nile
virus fecal excretion has been documented in waterfowl (Komar at CDC, I
believe) and chickens (DA Senne, et. al., Avian Diseases 44: 642-649, 2000).
Further, Steele, et. al. (KE Steele, et. al, Veterinary Pathology
37:208-244, 2000) noted extensive West Nile virus immunohistochemical
staining of intestinal sections in their study of the pathology of West Nile
virus from the Bronx Zoo in New York (they have a excellent photomicrograph
of such staining in a fish crow on page 221 of their paper).
Taken together with the crow study there appears to be little doubt that
West Nile virus infected birds excrete virus in their feces. Whereas, the
chicken study failed to demonstrate contagion or even seroconversion in
uninfected intimate contact controls, this still does not rule out the
possibility that in other species of birds fecal viral shedding may be of
sufficient duration and titer to infect birds in close contact or by
preening. On the other side of the coin, I am unfortunately (or fortunately,
depending on ones perspective) reminded daily that experimental findings
frequently do not manifest themselves in "the real world". Thus, while the
results of this study are very interesting indeed, they may not be directly
applicable to the "wild" situation.

West Nile virus transmission: Exclusion of Ectoparasites
--------------------------------------------------------
In regards the questions about the presence of ectoparasites on the crows in
the experimental study by Bob McClean, et. al., I had a telephone discussion
with Dr. McClean on Friday (27 Oct 2000) about the study and he informed me
that the birds were examined for ectoparasites and treated with Ivermectin
prior to the study which took place in a BSL-3 facility.

[Some questions are answered, and new ones posed. Transmission by
ectoparasites was excluded in the design of the bird-to-bird transmission
study. It has also been established that West Nile virus is excreted in the
feces of infected birds. What remains indeterminate, among other factors,
are the oral infectious dose and the infectivity of excreted feces. - Mod.CP
