The Departmental Veterinary Medical College of Lima warned that there is a risk that canine rabies could be reintroduced in the capital.

This situation could be due to the weakness of the epidemiological surveillance system in the capital, a vital tool to identify the increase in cases. Last year [2020], in Lima only, 11 samples were received and processed for the diagnosis of rabies, when in the capital, there are about 2 million dogs.

"There should be approximately 4000 annual samples as epidemiological surveillance, considering the recommendations of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the current regulations on rabies surveillance in the country," the Veterinary Medical College statement warned.

This situation is complicated if we take into account that, in 2020, the Ministry of Health detected 24 cases of canine rabies in the country, of which 20 corresponded to Arequipa and 4 to Puno. Meanwhile, in January of this year [2021] alone, 10 cases of rabies were reported in Arequipa. "This highlights the high risk of human rabies cases in Arequipa and canine rabies in other cities of the country, as well as in Lima," he said.

For this reason, he recommended veterinarians from the private sector send samples to a nearby health facility or to the Zoonosis Control Health Center (formerly the Anti-Rabies Center), located in Cercado de Lima.

"All colleagues from private clinics, as well as the Comprehensive Health Directorates (Diris) of Lima, are urged to carry out the important work of epidemiological surveillance by reporting and sending samples of dead animals that, prior to death, were noted to have nervous signs compatible with rabies, or deaths from being run over," according to the alert.

[This does sound concerning. In addition to trying to increase samples, they should be encouraging rabies vaccination of all pet animals. This could be a community-organized event with the majority of veterinarians participating at the mass vaccination clinic or clinics in an area.

The low-cost, community drives, usually hosted under a large tent or in a designated building in a central location to the area being targeted on a particular day, have been shown to increase awareness of rabies in an area as well as getting pets vaccinated against the deadly disease. This is not a money-making situation for veterinarians but rather a concerted effort to decrease the number rabies cases in animals, thus protecting individuals. Often times, a company will donate the vaccine, and staff and veterinarians in an area will donate their time to vaccinate animals. There is often some nominal charge, mainly to cover the cost of renting a tent or paying the electricity, etc. The very low cost of vaccine clinics helps encourage individuals to bring all or most of their animals there.

We wish them success in increasing the number of vaccinated pets as well as more veterinarians submitting appropriate samples to the appropriate laboratory for testing.

Cost of submitting samples to the laboratory may be a concern for clients or veterinarians if the cost of testing is too high. Also, if individuals believe there is no risk of this disease, as the area may have been declared free of rabies, they may be less inclined to vaccinate or to test a animal.

Making the public aware of the dangers and the steps to combat the disease may go a long way in both increasing awareness and getting more animals vaccinated, and diseased animals tested. - Mod.TG
