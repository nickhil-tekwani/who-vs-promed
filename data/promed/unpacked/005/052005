Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comment: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H7N3 was confirmed on one commercial meat-type turkey premises in Chesterfield County, South Carolina. Clinical signs included respiratory signs, snicking, and increased mortality. State officials have quarantined the affected premises, and depopulation of birds has been completed. Movement controls have also been implemented. This is the 1st confirmed case of HPAI in commercial poultry in the USA this year [2020]. The premises has an epidemiological link to another South Carolina premises affected recently by low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H7N3. The USDA Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and South Carolina State Veterinarian's Office, part of Clemson University Livestock Poultry Health (CULPH), continue conducting a comprehensive epidemiological investigation and enhanced surveillance already underway in the area.

Control measures
Measures applied: Movement control inside the country; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; quarantine; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; stamping out; zoning; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: Disinfection
