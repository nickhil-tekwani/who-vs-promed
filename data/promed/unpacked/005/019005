At least 63 confirmed cases of malaria have been reported through the surveillance system in the last 4 weeks, with 75% corresponding to the localized focus in the neighborhoods of Santo Domingo Oeste [West].

Until the beginning of September 2018, 294 cases were reported in the entire country, with the neighborhoods of La Cienaga, Hato Nuevo, Caballona, and Manoguayabo, in Santo Domingo Oeste, and Las Mercedes in Los Alcarrizos presenting the highest incidence of this febrile disease, transmitted by the bite of the _Anopheles_ mosquito, which breeds in standing and dirty water, especially where there is vegetation.

In the past week, the surveillance system detected 25 confirmed cases, all autochthonous, including 17 men and 8 women with ages ranging from 13 to 62 years, according to the data contained in the epidemiologic bulletin for week 35.

[This is a large outbreak of introduced malaria with an increasing number of local cases. It is important to apply vector control and early case detection and treatment. Treatment should include a single dose of primaquine to block transmission.

An outbreak of introduced _Plasmodium vivax_ malaria in Greece in 2011 to 2012 was terminated by applying mass drug administration to the migrant worker population from _P. vivax_ endemic countries (Tseroni M, Baka A, Kapizioni C, et al. Prevention of malaria resurgence in Greece through the association of mass drug administration (MDA) to immigrants from malaria-endemic regions and standard control measures. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2015; 9(11): e0004215. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0004215; https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0004215).

The malaria in this outbreak is almost certainly introduced by migrants from Haiti, and a mass drug administration program similar to the program used in Greece would eliminate a reservoir of malaria in semi-immune and asymptomatic individuals. - Mod.EP
