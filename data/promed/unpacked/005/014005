A case of _B. melitensis_ in bovines in Haute-Savoie
--------------------------------------------------
A case of brucellosis was confirmed in Haute-Savoie April 6, 2012, in a dairy cattle operation, following an abortion.

The bacterium _Brucella melitensis biovar 3_ has been isolated from the milk of a cow that had aborted. The farm has been declared infected and all cattle in the herd will be slaughtered as soon as possible. Additional analyzes will be conducted in the infected herd to assess the extent of infection.

To date, a total of 39 farms which may be epidemiologically linked to the infected farm are subject to special investigations. These herds have had a direct or indirect contact with animals from the infected farm. The investigations will address both the origin and extent of infection, while ensuring control of the spread of the disease.

In addition, milk products made from raw milk from the herd are being recalled and consumers are being informed by posters placed on the points of sale and by a press release.

Brucellosis is a major zoonosis. The confirmed case in Haute-Savoie, similarly to a human brucellosis case suspected as indigenous which has recently been detected in the same area, should encourage all those engaged in surveillance to pay particular attention to regulatory oversight measures (prophylaxis and surveillance of abortions).

Abortions cases in cattle, sheep and goats must be reported so the relevant veterinary health officials in order to facilitate timely sampling and surveillance.

[The reservoir of _B. abortus_ is, generally, cattle and of _B. melitensis_, sheep and goats, though cross infections may occur. In fact, cattle may readily be infected also by _B. melitensis_, discharging the bacteria in milk, in most cases without suffering abortions. This phenomenon may have significant public health impact.

_B. abortus_ has been reported from France last time in May 2003, and _B. melitensis in June 2003. Previously, France maintained vaccination policy against _B. melitensis_ and was one of 5 EU Mediterranean member states where activities, supported by the EC, to combat and eradicate _B. melitensis_ were applied.-Mod.AS.
