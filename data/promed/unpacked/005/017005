Chennai Corporation health officials are on alert to a fresh outbreak of
chikungunya in the city limits. [Chennai was formerly named Madras].
Over the past week, health workers listed 123 persons across the city
showing symptoms of the disease spread by mosquitoes. In North Chennai,
comprising Tondiarpet, Basin Bridge and Pulianthope zones, 57 suspected
cases were reported. The latest ones came from Anna Nagar.
Starting Monday, the civic agency launched early morning fogging operations
in vulnerable areas such as slums, targeting mosquitoes active during the
day. Rapid action teams have been formed for each of the 10 zones. Each
consists of an entomologist, a sanitary inspector and health workers.
Eighteen fogging machines have been deployed to spray a mixture of
pyrethrum insecticide and diesel fuel from 5 a.m. to 8 a.m.
Residents are being sensitised to breeding of mosquitoes. The _Aedes
aegypti_ species that spreads the disease breeds in fresh water.
The symptoms are sudden fever, severe arthralgia (joint pain), headache,
chills and rashes, almost similar to those of dengue. Apart from
medication, patients are asked to increase intake of fluids and take
adequate rest.
A chikungunya outbreak was first suspected in the city [Chennai] last month
[May 2006] when there were reports that the disease was spreading from the
Andhra Pradesh border.
The civic agency collected blood samples from 22 persons and sent them to
the National Institute of Virology in Pune. Four samples tested positive
for the virus.
Alpha Virus causes the disease. It was first isolated in 1953 in Tanzania
and in Asia at Bangkok in 1958. The name 'chikungunya' is derived from a
Swahili word meaning 'which bends up,' referring to the posture of the
patients suffering from the disease.
