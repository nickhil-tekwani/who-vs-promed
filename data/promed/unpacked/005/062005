UK No Longer BSE Risk
----------------------
The UK's Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has
formally submitted a paper to the European Commission laying down why the
UK should no longer be considered a BSE high-risk country.
The paper, which provides detailed statistical evidence on the decline of
the BSE epidemic in the UK, follows the decision in May by the world animal
health body -- the Office Internationale des Epizooties (OIE) -- to agree
to increasing international thresholds for BSE risk categorisation.
The decision by the OIE, if incorporated into EU legislation, could allow
the UK to move from high-risk to moderate-risk status in the near future.
This would enable the current controls on exports of beef, including the
stringent Date Based Export Scheme requirements, to be wound up.
Animal Health Minister Ben Bradshaw said recognition of reduced BSE cases
at EU level would place the UK on an equal footing with other EU countries,
but he accepted progress could be tough.
"Lowering of the UK's risk status will require a formal Opinion from the
European Food Safety Authority, the EU's scientific risk assessment body,
changes to EU legislation, and agreement of other member states. But we are
working hard to secure amendments as swiftly as possible," he said. "We
have now delivered detailed statistical information to the EU Commission,
which shows that the epidemic has declined sufficiently for the UK to be
classified as a moderate-risk country in 2003.
"This is completely new territory for the UK, and we will have a large
number of hurdles to jump. However, there is considerable evidence to
support our case, and we will want to see early progress," he added.

The following summary is derived from the extensive (101 pages) document,
"Intercomparison study for the determination of processed animal proteins
including meat and bone meal in animal feed", by Gisele Gizzi, Christoph
von Holst, Vincent Baeten, Gilbert Berben & Leo van Raamsdonk. The authors
belong to Belgian and Dutch institutes.
Summary
----
In the present study we report on the results from an intercomparison study
for the determination of processed animal proteins (PAPs) including meat
and bone meal (MBM)in animal feed. The major aim of the study was to
evaluate the proficiency of European laboratories to correctly classify
feed samples containing different types of PAPs and MBM at various
concentration levels.
Additionally, it was intended to compare the performance of the most
important methods, which are microscopy, polymerase chain reaction (PCR),
and immunoassays. One laboratory applied a different protocol based on high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
Control laboratories mainly applying microscopy as well as laboratories
conducting research and working on PCR or immunoassays participated in the
study. The total number of laboratories was 51, submitting 55 sets of
results. 3 laboratories applied various protocols, submitting more than one
set of results.
For the parameter total PAPs representing PAPs from all terrestrial animals
and fish, the laboratories applying microscopy scored highest, compared to
the laboratories using PCR or immunoassays. Most of the laboratories
applying microscopy were also able to detect the presence of total PAPs in
the test material containing MBM at a very low concentration of 0.1
percent. In contrast, PCR failed in the determination of total PAPs
indicated by about 46 percent of false negative results, which was observed
irrespective of the MBM concentration in the feed.
Some of the laboratories using immunoassays scored excellently, whereas
others showed very poor proficiency. The laboratory applying the HPLC
method also scored very well, since all samples were correctly classified.
The parameter "PAPs from terrestrial animals" is applicable only to
microscopy and allows evaluating the capability of the laboratories to
differentiate between terrestrial animals and fish. The evaluation of the
results showed that in samples containing 5 percent of fish meal and 0.5
percent of terrestrial MBM, the presence of "PAPs from terrestrial animals"
could be detected by an acceptable high number of laboratories. However,
when the MBM was 0.1 percent, the portion of correct positive results was
much smaller indicated by a portion of false negative results of about 50
percent.
The determination of PAPs from mammals, [including?] ruminants and pigs,
which is the domain of laboratories applying immunoassay or PCR, showed
very poor results, especially when applying PCR. Laboratories using PCR
reported a high number of false positive and false negative results
irrespective of the composition and the concentration of the MBM in the
feed. Interestingly, the results form the current study are similar to the
results from the PCR validation study conducted by the JRC [EU's Joint
Research Centre] in 1998, which showed that the protocol from 1998 was not
fit for the purpose. The only PCR method that scored quite well was applied
by a member of the organiser team of the study. Further investigation will
show whether these positive results can be repeated when other laboratories
apply the same protocol. In comparison to PCR the laboratories using
immunoassays scored much better.
A significant improvement of the methods in terms of sensitivity and ease
of use could be observed, especially when compared with the characteristics
of former tests. However, some of the laboratories reported the presence of
PAPs from mammalian in samples when there was only fish meal present,
thereby indicating a lack of specificity. Improvement in specificity would
definitely increase the value of immunoassays.
The evaluation regarding PAPs from ruminants showed that the vast majority
of the laboratories were not able to classify correctly this parameter.
Again, some laboratories applying immunoassays could detect PAPs from
ruminants at a concentration of about 0.25 percent.
The results demonstrated that currently there is no single method available
that can be applied to various purposes such as
(1) control of the total MBM ban,
(2) detection of terrestrial animals against fish, or
(3) the detection of mammalian MBM.
Microscopy turned out to be reliable for purpose (1) and partly for purpose
(2) depending on the concentration. Some immunoassays seem to have the
potential for being successfully applied to the purpose (3). Almost all
laboratories applying PCR failed, thus demonstrating that this methodology
needs major revisions. Similarly, laboratories need significant improvement
of their capability to detect PAPs from ruminants.
The main advantages of the applied immunoassays are the good sensitivity
along with a capability of a high sample throughput. A major problem seemed
to be a possible cross-reactivity with fish meal. However, when also
applying microscopy the latter method could compensate for this
disadvantage of immunoassays, thereby indicating that a combination of
various methods could be a good solution. A possible future model of
detection of PAP at several levels (total, terrestrial, mammalian,
ruminant) could include a screening test based on immunoassays, whereas
only the samples positive for PAP will be subjected to a confirmation test
for more detailed identification of the type of PAP. The latter can be
either microscopy or PCR once a robust protocol has been established. In
all cases protocols need to be improved and documentation and training
possibilities need to be developed.
[The results of these important observations should cause concern. They
demonstrate the shortcomings of techniques currently used to identify --
and prevent introduction into the feed chain -- of locally produced or
imported animal feed ingredients which may have been incidentally or
deliberately contaminated with banned animal proteins. - Mod.AS].

The following summary is derived from EU's "Report on The Monitoring and
Testing of Ruminants for the Presence of Transmissible Spongiform
Encephalopathy (TSE) In 2002":
SUMMARY
----
In 2002, a total of 10 423 882 bovine, 353 330 ovine, and 54 444 caprine
animals were tested in the framework of the TSE monitoring programme. 2126
bovine, 1576 ovine, and 41 caprine animals turned out positive. The
positive cases in bovine animals were considered BSE cases, while those in
ovine and caprine animals as scrapie.
1 238 617 at-risk bovine animals were tested by rapid tests and 9 124 887
healthy animals slaughtered for human consumption. 2658 bovine animals were
tested in the framework of passive surveillance (animals reported as BSE
suspects by the farmer or the veterinary practitioner and subject to
laboratory examination). In addition, 57 720 animals were tested in the
framework of culling of animals with an epidemiological connection to a BSE
case. 68 percent of positive cases were detected by the active monitoring
(testing of risk animals, healthy slaughtered and culled cattle) and 32
percent were detected by passive surveillance. BSE cases were found in all
Member States except Austria, Greece, Finland and Sweden.
The prevalence of BSE cases decreased by 20 percent in 2002 compared to
2001. This reduction in prevalence and the increasing age of positive cases
indicates that measures taken in the past are producing effect.
350 557 ovine animals were tested by active monitoring, while 2773 were
animals reported as scrapie suspects and therefore subjected to laboratory
examination. In caprine animals, the numbers of tests in the respective
groups were 54 381 (active monitoring) and 63 (scrapie suspects). The
information on the genotypes of positive ovine animals is still limited.
The results indicate the importance of active monitoring in small ruminants
and the need for further evaluation of TSE susceptibility of different
genotypes.

Beef boost
-----------
More than 230 000 tonnes of additional British beef could be available next
year if controls to limit the risk of BSE infection are changed.
The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is due to meet on Thursday this week [see
further item 5 for results of the meeting] to decide whether to recommend
an alternative to the Over Thirty Month (OTM) rule which was introduced in
1996. The rule bans meat from most cattle aged over 30 months from being
sold for human consumption, to reduce the risk of BSE.
One option under consideration would be to replace the ban with screening
for BSE, similar to that used in other European countries. Another
possibility is to introduce screening, but continue the ban on cattle born
before 1 Aug 1996, when tighter feed controls were brought in.
The Meat and Livestock Commission (MLC) says replacing the OTM rule with
screening would mean an extra 800 000 cattle eligible for human consumption
next year, generating 232 000 tonnes of meat or a 35 percent rise in UK
production.
The other option would mean an extra 155 000 tonnes of beef from 535 000
head of cattle next year or a 24 percent increase in supply. The board of
the FSA could decide to adopt either of the options or choose another
altogether.
According to the MLC, much of the extra meat could be used to replace
current beef imports. The Government has also indicated it may be willing
to consider a "purchase-for-destruction" scheme caused by over-supply.
The other possibility of exports was given a boost last week when the
Government took the first steps towards having the UK's BSE risk status
downgraded from high to medium [see 1]. The move would pave the way for the
end of a scheme which prevents the export of meat from cattle born before 1
Aug 1996, and aged over 30 months.
Part of the Government's argument for changing the UK's status was a sharp
fall in the number of BSE cases, from more than 37 000 at the peak of the
epidemic in 1992/3 to just 309 so far this year [for 2002 figures, see
comment in 1].
A spokesman for the NFU said: "Whatever final recommendations emerge from
this review, it is vital the FSA communicates clearly, carefully and
effectively with the public in order to maintain consumer confidence in
beef, regardless of age." Guy Attenborough, spokesman for the MLC, said
that it was essential consumer confidence was maintained and if the switch
to a full testing regime was made there should be a robust trial run.

FSA recommends Ministers replace OTM rule with BSE testing
-------------------------------------------------
The Food Standards Agency (FSA) Board have agreed to recommend to Ministers
that it would be acceptable on public health grounds to replace the Over
Thirty Months (OTM) rule with BSE testing of cattle older than 30 months in
2 stages.
Cattle born after August 1996 could be allowed into the food chain, after
being tested for BSE, at the earliest from January 2004, with the
possibility of complete replacement of the rule from July 2005.
The Board said that because of the need for effective implementation of the
proposed changes, Ministers should not change the OTM rule until they were
satisfied that the necessary preparations had been made by the relevant
Government departments, industry and other agencies throughout the UK. The
Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) is
responsible for taking these arrangements forward.
The OTM rule on UK beef and imports remains in force until any changes are
implemented. If the OTM rule is replaced, any cattle testing positive for
BSE would have to be destroyed.
The other main controls are to remain unchanged. These are the Specified
Risk Material (SRM) control, which removes 99 percent of any infectivity
that may be present in cattle, and the ban on feeding meat-and-bone meal to
cattle.
The FSA Board also agreed that an independent review would report monthly
on the BSE testing system and a final report would be published.
The Board agreed that it was acceptable on the grounds of risk that
casualty animals that had tested negative for BSE and cleared other public
health controls, could be allowed into the food chain but there needed to
be further clarification of how these casualties were defined (See Note 1).
The Board's decision follows a year-long review of the OTM rule, which
began in July 2002 with the setting up of a stakeholder group. The group's
final report, considered at a public meeting in March this year and subject
to a 3-month UK-wide consultation, has been key to informing the Board's
decision.
The Board agreed with the stakeholder group that the difference in risk to
public health between the OTM rule and the testing of all OTM cattle was
very small, but the costs of maintaining the OTM scheme are very large.
Sir John Krebs, Chair of the FSA Board, said: "Variant CJD is a terrible
disease, and in reviewing the controls, the Agency has to ensure that
public health is effectively protected.
"We have examined the evidence thoroughly and listened carefully during the
consultation. We have had to balance the possibility of a very small
increase in risk from a move to testing, with the very large costs
associated with the OTM rule. We were also mindful that 99 percent of any
possible infectivity is removed by other BSE controls and that there has
been a continual and steep decline of BSE in the UK. The controls are
proving to be effective, but public confidence can be maintained only
through vigilance and transparency. That is why we will be conducting an
independent review of the new controls and that will be made public.
"Our view is that replacing the OTM rule with testing is acceptable on
public health grounds. However, Ministers should not change the rule until
they are satisfied that the necessary preparations have been made and the
date of change should be dependent on that."
Notes to Editors
1. Animals that die on farm are not classed as casualties and do not enter
the food chain. There are public health controls that would prevent some
casualties entering the food chain.
2. The most realistic estimate is that allowing casualties into the food
chain, subject to BSE testing, would change the risk of an additional vCJD
cases over sixty years from 0.03-0.04 within a range of 0.002-2.5
additional cases.
3. The recent risk assessment by Imperial College, "Assessment of risk
posed by BSE in cattle in Great Britain and the impact of potential changes
to the current control measures" by Neil Ferguson and Christl Donnelly,
Imperial College published online in the Proceedings of the Royal Society,
London B, DOI 10.1098/rspb.2003.2484, can be found here:

4. The Imperial College risk assessment concluded that, based on the most
realistic estimates, the agreed recommendation could mean less than one
additional vCJD case over the next 60 years. The worst case could be about
2.5 additional cases over the next 60 years. The OTM rule costs BP360m a
year, compared to around BP60m a year for the agreed recommendation.
5. From a peak of over 37 000 clinical BSE cases in 1992, UK cases are
currently declining by some 40 percent year-on-year. Last year 445 clinical
cases were found and 594 cases were detected by tests.
6. There have been 137 vCJD cases in the UK to date.
7. All cattle born in the same herd within 12 months of an animal testing
positive for BSE, or reared with a BSE case and which may have consumed the
same feed, would be destroyed under current EU legislation.

Bush wants quick action on BSE
------------------------------
United States president George Bush promised 7 Jul 2003 that he wants a
"quick solution" that will allow the U.S. border to open soon for Canadian
cattle. In a telephone conversation with prime minister Jean Chretien, Bush
said he appreciated the problem the border closing has caused for the North
American industry, according to a spokesperson in Chretien's office.
"The prime minister explained to president Bush the situation in Canada,
the impact on our industry, as well as everything Canada has done," she
said in an interview. "President Bush many times during the conversation
said he was hoping for a quick solution for this and he has asked his
officials to act quickly."
The border has been closed since 20 May 2003, when it was announced that a
single case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy had been found in Alberta.
Since then, hundreds of millions of dollars worth of trade to the U.S. and
overseas has stopped and Canadian cattle prices have collapsed.
On 9-10 Jul 2003, federal and provincial agriculture ministers meet in
Winnipeg and BSE will be a key topic. On 12 Jul, federal minister Lyle
Vanclief meets the Japanese agriculture minister in Ottawa to try to
convince him Canadian beef is safe.
In Washington, an official for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association
said Bush's intervention was good news. "Obviously, it is a tremendous
priority for him and therefore a priority for his administration," NCBA
trade official Karen Batra said. "The word will get out that he wants the
border open as quickly as possible."
5 days earlier, on 2 Jul 2003, the NCBA joined with the Canadian
Cattlemen's Association and the American meat processing industry to call
for an opening of the border by the end of July.
"Without jeopardizing public health or the health of the cattle herd, we
are serious about the importance of re-establishing trade between the U.S.
and Canada and the world based on science as promptly as possible," 4
industry groups said in letters sent to Canadian and American governments.
They said governments should move quickly to ensure that specified risk
materials such as nervous system tissue not be used in consumer products.
By mid-July 2003, both countries should tell the world "how we will
continue to expand BSE surveillance and the development of an animal
identification system in the U.S. parallel to the existing Canadian
identification system."
During the 7 Jul conversation between American and Canadian leaders,
Chretien told Bush that Canada plans to implement recommendations from
international experts including a toughening of surveillance, feed
regulations and cattle tracking.
But some cattle sector leaders are worried the Canadian reaction might go
further and faster than U.S. rules. Because the market is integrated,
tougher Canadian rules could block American cattle flowing north.
"It is a delicate issue," said a Canadian Food Inspection Agency official
who asked not to be identified. "But if we go much ahead of the Americans,
it could keep the border closed both ways. Create a door padlocked on both
sides."
Neil Jahnke, president of the CCA, said that Canada must be careful to go
no further than the science can justify and the Americans can do. "We need
to work with the Americans and walk with them on this and not do a
knee-jerk reaction that is more than we need and would create problems with
North American trade," he said from his ranch near Gouldtown, Sask.
Saskatchewan New Democrat MP Dick Proctor saw a problem. "Canada is in a
situation now where it has to prove that it has the safest beef on the
planet, yet at the same time we're saying we're an integrated market with
the United States and we can't be off-side with them. It is an anomaly."
Meanwhile, the House of Commons agriculture committee meets on 10 Jul to
hear testimony from packers and retailers about why prices have not fallen
in stores while farmer prices have collapsed. And opposition leader Stephen
Harper is going to Washington this week to lobby for a quick border opening.

[The proposed significant change in UK's BSE control policy is a clear
manifestation of the improved epidemiological situation there, as well as
in most European countries (see 3). Spain is the only European country not
showing, in 2003, a decline in the number of diagnosed cases. However, the
addition of Canada as the third non-European country in the list of 23 BSE
affected (indigenous cases) countries, is a reminder that this new disease
is still haunting the world and causing grave economic losses. A recent
demonstration of its continuing impact is the demands of Japan, the single
biggest buyer of U.S. beef, for stricter safeguards against Canadian
product being included in American beef shipments to Japan. The press
reports that Japanese and U.S. agriculture officials failed to make
progress in resolving the future of beef trade during talks on Thu, 10 Jul
2003. The Japanese are due to hold talks in Canada as well. So far,
Canada's implementation of the BSE control measures recently recommended by
an international panel is pending.
"New" disease, however, is a relative term: one should keep in mind that
BSE has been with us longer than usually perceived -- probably as long as
30 years or even longer. Throughout this period, the causative agent(s)
could have reached many a country in more than one continent, mainly in
animal feed ingredients, and to a lesser extent by the international trade
in live cattle.
The earliest officially recorded case of BSE has become to be known as cow
142, [from] Pitsham Farm in Sussex. Brain samples from this cow were first
examined in September 1985. It was not, however, until June 1987 that the
Consultant Pathology Unit at the Central Veterinary Laboratory, Weybridge,
UK, confirmed this as a case of BSE. However, the BSE inquiry ("Lord
Phillips Report", October 2000) further remarked: "Epidemiological evidence
given to the Inquiry suggests that it is likely that the first cases of BSE
pre-dated by some years -- possibly as many as 10 or more -- the first case
of BSE to be diagnosed as such"; see Volume 3: The Early Years, 1986-88,
in the BSE Inquiry Report:
