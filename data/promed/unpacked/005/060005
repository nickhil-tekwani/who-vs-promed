From: Duff Paul (Penrith) <Paul.P.Duff2@vla.maff.gov.uk>

_Salmonella enteritidis_ pt 11 now appears to be endemic,to a degree, in UK
hedgehogs, having first been reported in Eastern England (Keymer, Vet Rec).
The organism has been isolated from hedgehogs in several areas of England
and Wales.
It is conceivable, I suppose, that children may become infected from lawns
contaminated by hedgehog faeces/urine.

[Hedgehogs have an iconic status in the UK which results in them getting a
high level of protection and enthusiasm, so Paul's suggestion may not be as
way far out as some might feel, even if the reality turns out to be more
prosaic, like (composted) garbage diving by hedgehogs searching for beetles
and earthworms. - Mod.MHJ
