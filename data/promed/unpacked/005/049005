An outbreak of hepatitis A is growing concern among Floridians. The outbreak continues to grow across the state, with 70 cases reported last week [week of 22 Apr 2019], according to the Florida Department of Health website. As of Sat 27 Apr 2019, 954 cases of the contagious liver disease had been reported in the state in 2019, compared to 549 cases in all of 2018 and 276 cases in 2017.

Health officials say the outbreak began in 2018, and 97 percent of the cases since 1 Jan 2018, have likely been acquired in Florida. During that period, Pinellas county has had the most cases, with 319. Pinellas has been followed by Pasco county with 267 cases; Orange county with 179 cases; and Hillsborough county with 165 cases, according to the Department of Health website.

The hepatitis A outbreak that has spread across 18 states, infecting over 15 000 people, has crept into Virginia. According to the state's Department of Health, there have been 45 cases reported in Virginia as of the beginning of this week [week of 22 Apr 2019], a 132 percent increase in cases compared to this time in 2018.

The nationwide outbreak has been going on since 2016. Of the 15 000 cases, 57 percent required hospitalizations, and 140 deaths resulted from the virus, according to the CDC. Largely, those impacted have been high-risk populations like drug users, people experiencing homelessness, men who have sex with men and people who are or were recently incarcerated.

That's what makes this outbreak different from others the state has experienced in the past (like the one related to frozen strawberries in 2016), explained Marshall Vogt, epidemiologist with the Department of Health's Division of Immunization: it's spreading from person to person and isn't tied to a food source.

Southwest Virginia saw the increase in cases first, Vogt said, possibly due to the fact that West Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee are also dealing with the outbreak. But now the Department of Health has seen cases statewide.

The best defense for the virus is vaccination, though good hand hygiene helps as well. According to the CDC, children are routinely vaccinated between their 1st and 2nd birthdays, but the vaccine has only been available since 1995, so some adults may not have received it.

In Virginia, the vaccine is not required for school entry, so there is no statewide data on how well-immunized the population is. Vogt said that's a frustrating limitation, but the outbreak related to frozen strawberries may have prompted many adults across the state to get their vaccination already, though there's no way to know that for sure.

But, fortunately, the vaccination is very effective, he said. "One dose is 95 percent effective, and after 2 doses, protection reaches almost 100 percent, with minimal side effects," Vogt said. "Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to protect from this, and that's why we want to raise attention of the importance of people checking their vaccination status."

[3] Louisiana: fatality

The Louisiana Department of Health [LDH] reported the 1st death related to an ongoing hepatitis A outbreak across the state. East Baton Rouge parish and Livingston parish reported the highest number of cases for surrounding parishes.

Timeline
--------
On 26 Apr 2019, Louisiana reported 139 cases of HAV infection, including 3 not linked to the current outbreak. This report also noted that one death has been associated with the outbreak.
On 12 Apr 2019, Louisiana reported 112 cases of HAV infection, including 3 not linked to the current outbreak.
On 29 Mar 2019, Louisiana reported 100 cases of HAV infection, including 3 not linked to the current outbreak.
On 22 Feb 2019, Louisiana reported 72 cases of HAV infection, including 3 not linked to the current outbreak.
On 1 Feb 2019, Louisiana reported 58 cases of HAV infection, including 3 not linked to the current outbreak.
On 12 Jan 2019, Louisiana reported 49 cases of HAV infection, including 3 not linked to the current outbreak.
On 28 Dec 2018, Louisiana reported 34 cases of HAV infection, including 3 not linked to the current outbreak.
On 21 Dec 2018, Louisiana reported 29 cases of HAV infection, including 3 not linked to the current outbreak.
On 14 Dec 2018, Louisiana reported 24 cases of 3 infection, including 3 not linked to the current outbreak. That's nearly three times the number of cases LDH saw in 2017.

Hepatitis A is contracted by consuming contaminated food or drink, through sex, and by being in close contact with someone in the same living quarters. Those at higher risk of getting the illness include travelers, pregnant women, people who inject drugs, and the homeless. An infected person can transmit the virus to others up to 2 weeks before symptoms appear, and even those who do not experience symptoms can transmit the virus to others.

The CDC website also reports on outbreaks in a number of other states (https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/outbreaks/2017March-HepatitisA.htm) and cases in food handlers continue to be reported.

As the numbers of cases continue to rise in a number of states, and news of smaller (so far) outbreaks occur in others, the question at the end of ProMED post 20190104.6241686 by a Kentucky official, "This is a disease of developing countries. One has to ask: Why are we seeing it in the USA?" is more and more relevant. We are seeing these outbreaks because of the inability to deal with marginalized populations among their midst. The dramatic cutbacks in public health infrastructure in some of these states clearly feed the fire of these outbreaks. They must be addressed by bolstering public health resources and education and directly addressing the needs of these marginalized populations.

The ACIP (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) in 2018 voted unanimously to recommend adding homeless individuals to the list of those who are at increased risk of hepatitis A infection or severe hepatitis A disease. That list now includes travelers, men who have sex with men, users of injection and non-injection drugs, people with clotting-factor disorders, people who work with nonhuman primates, people who anticipate close personal contact with an international adoptee, people with chronic liver disease, and homeless individuals (https://www.aafp.org/news/health-of-the-public/20181031acipmeeting.html).

Of note, from MMWR 11 Apr 2019: Notes from the field: Acute hepatitis A virus infection among previously vaccinated persons with HIV infection -- Tennessee, 2018 (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6814a3.htm?s_cid=mm6814a3_w): "Previous vaccination for hepatitis did not reliably provide protection among some persons with HIV infection. Approximately half of the patients with HAV and HIV infections were previously vaccinated. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices does not currently address specific PEP [post-exposure prophylaxis] considerations for persons with HIV infection who have been fully vaccinated against hepatitis A. CDC guidelines recommend IG and a dose of vaccine as PEP for hepatitis A for previously unvaccinated persons who are immunocompromised, including persons with HIV infection. These findings support the consideration by providers to administer IG as PEP for all persons with HIV infection who experience high-risk exposure to a person with HAV infection, regardless of the exposed person's prior vaccination history or immune status."
