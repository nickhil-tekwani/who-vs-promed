CDC lab testing confirms cause of melioidosis outbreak
------------------------------------------------------
The CDC today, 26 Oct 2021, confirmed that bacteria in a Better Homes & Gardens [BHG] aromatherapy spray in a Georgia melioidosis patient's home genetically matches the bacterial strains in the patient, and 3 other patients in Kansas, Minnesota, and Texas infected since March 2021.

CDC had announced Friday, [22 Oct 2021], that a bottle of the BHG aromatherapy spray in "Lavender & Chamomile with Gemstones" scent had tested positive for _Burkholderia pseudomallei_, the bacterium that causes melioidosis. But the final step in the investigation, being reported today [26 Oct 2021], was to confirm the DNA fingerprint of the bacterium in the spray and in the patients was the same. This allows CDC to confirm the spray or one of its ingredients caused the 4 melioidosis infections.

"When you think about the thousands of things people come in contact with around their homes, it's remarkable we were able to identify the source and confirm it in the lab," said Inger Damon, MD, PhD, director of CDC's Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology. "CDC scientists and our partners found the proverbial needle in the haystack."

With the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and Walmart, CDC has contacted the manufacturer in India to determine whether ingredients from the implicated spray were used in any other products. CDC scientists are working to assess the extent of contamination in other bottles and whether other scents may also be contaminated. Since Friday [22 Oct 2021], CDC testing of an additional bottle of the spray has tested positive for the bacterium.

Anyone who has a bottle of BHG Lavender & Chamomile Aromatherapy Spray with Gemstones or other scents in the same product line purchased from Walmart online or in these Walmart stores (https://corporate.walmart.com/media-library/document/bhg-aromatherapy-room-spray-revised-store-list/_proxyDocument?id=0000017c-bda3-d0b3-a7ff-bdf7397b0000) between February 2021 and [21 Oct 2021], should stop using it immediately and follow the steps listed on CDC's website (https://www.cdc.gov/melioidosis/outbreak/2021/index.html) to safely return the product to Walmart. CPSC and Walmart recalled about 3900 bottles of aromatherapy spray on 22 Oct 2021. Walmart is offering consumers a refund and a USD 20 gift card for its return.

CDC emphasized that consumers should not pour the contents down the drain or throw the bottle in the trash. The bacterium that causes melioidosis does not normally live in soil and water in the USA. If the spray bottles end up in landfills, the bacteria could become established and cause future melioidosis cases in the USA. CDC is working with Walmart to ensure the returned bottles are disposed of properly and safely.

[As expected, the investigation has confirmed that the _B. pseudomallei_ identified in the aromatherapy spray genetically matched the patient isolates. Now another spray bottle has been found to be positive. It is yet to be determined which ingredient in the product was contaminated and therefore whether other products might be contaminated. Along with a case acquired in the USA from tropical fish imported from South Asia (Melioidosis - USA (03): (MD) non-travel, 2019, fresh water aquarium source 20211001.8698818), it has been a surprising year for this disease in the USA. - Mod.LL
