A provincial health official again called on the public to have pets and other animals vaccinated against rabies as the fatal disease claimed its 4th victim in the province, a 6-year-old boy from Lemery town.

According to Dr Maria Socorro Colmenares-Quinon of the Iloilo Provincial Health Office (IPHO), her surveillance team in Barangay Alemanyana, Lemery found the case suggestive of human rabies because of the signs and symptoms manifested by the boy prior to his death last [27 Apr 2015]. She said the boy was bitten by a stray dog on his right forearm last [24 Feb 2015] and was brought to the Rural Health Unit of the town which later referred him to Sara Animal Bite Treatment Center. Dr Quinon however said the boy failed to undergo further treatment, and on [27 Apr 2015] manifested the symptoms of late stage of rabies infection such as photophobia (abnormal intolerance to light), and fear of water or hydrophobia. The boy died at around 7 p.m.

The 1st 3 human rabies deaths in the province were from the towns of Carles, San Dionisio, and San Rafael. The victims either failed to get or complete the needed treatment.

In 2014, the health official said only 2 rabies deaths were reported.

With this development, Dr Quinon said there is a need to heighten public awareness against rabies, especially during summer when children especially play outdoors and people tend to go out. She also called for the convening of the Municipal Rabies Coordinating Council headed by the Lemery mayor so that they can come up with plans on how to prevent the incidence of rabies in the town.

She said the boy's parents may also be given pre- or post-prophylaxis due to their exposure to rabies.

[Rabies is a severe problem in the Philippines, with 199 human deaths in 2013 and 202 in 2011, and with virtually all provinces with animal cases.

There is an active rabies control programme and as it succeeds with more public awareness, we can expect to see a contradictory increase in reporting. However until canine rabies is rare in the Philippines, there is the additional problem, characterised by this tragic case, that people exposed to rabid dogs must complete their post-exposure treatment.

Lemery is a 4th class municipality in the province of Iloilo, Western Visayas, Philippines. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 27 441 people; for a description of this municipality see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemery,_Iloilo. - Mod.MHJ]
