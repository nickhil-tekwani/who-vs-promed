From: hnash@wyoming.com (Hal Nash)

According to the first line in the posting Bovine Immunodeficiency Virus -
Netherlands "European consumers now have more cause for concern over what
they put in their mouths."
WHOA! This statement is particularly loaded with erroneous information. The
comments made at the end of this post do not directly address this
statement. Oh yes, it is stated that this virus is quite distant [in type
from [the human virus. But the initial text makes it sound as if the cows
were killed because of their danger to human beings, not to other cows. The
line quoted above plus the text about the slaughter... well, 2+2=4;
"European consumers might get bovine AIDS if they eat beef."
I consider myself not too particulary thick, but other readers might get the
wrong message. I would like to have read an unequivocal statement clarifying
the initial [one.

[Dr. Nash is quite right. I did not edit out the misleading statement, for
which I appologize. I appreciate our subcribersÂ´ efforts to keep the
information correct.
