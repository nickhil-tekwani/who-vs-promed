Preliminary test carried out by the research institutes in Egypt, revealed that the introduced foot and mouth disease [FMD] virus was of serotype SAT2; calves were said most likely to be infected.

Samples from infected animals have been sent to UK's Research Center for analysis and confirmation [WRLFMD]. Yusuf Mamduch, from the Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture, said that the results of the analysis will be back in 3 days; he added that Egypt has only 2 main serotypes of the virus in the available FMD vaccine. In case the results of the tests in the UK confirm that a new serotype is involved, Egypt will timely import vaccine of the relevant FMD virus to control the epidemic.

Foot & Mouth disease is a new strain
------------------------------------
Dr. Mohammad Reza Ismail, Minister of Agriculture, has said that the foot and mouth disease [FMD] which emerged in Egypt is a new strain. "Experts in the Veterinary Serum Institute in Abbassiya have determined the type of the strain, and we have started the production of vaccines suitable for this new strain."

During the parliament session on Monday [12 Mar 2012], the Minister responded to comments by Representatives about the emergence of the disease. He said that FMD is endemic in Egypt since more than 200 years, and was controlled by 2 vaccinations every year. However, in 2006 a virus strain appeared which was new; this crisis was overcome. This demonstrated a process which has to be undertaken whenever a new FMD strain is encountered, a situation which may recur every few years.

The Minister added that the disease began to appear in the center of the Delta, Gharbia Governorate, and when investigated it was found that cattle was infected in spite of being vaccinated 3 months earlier. Samples were analyzed in Egypt and sent to the UK-based international reference laboratory.

"We acted quickly by issuing an official Order on 4 Mar 2012 banning the transfer of cattle from center to center and from province to province, and not allowing the use of imported vaccines unless they were approved by the veterinary authorities; animal markets were closed as well."

The House of Representatives launched a sharp attack on the Ministry of Agriculture and veterinary services accusing them of allowing the importation of live cattle from countries infected with FMD which led to the spread of a new strain of the disease. Representatives argued that the import requirements took into account strains O and A, which are known to be present in Egypt, while the new strain is SAT2.

The MPs indicated various repercussions of this crisis, warning that cattle was slaughtered before dying, to save the meat which is sold to the public, similarly to milk which is distributed from infected farms without any supervision. They warned about dead animals thrown into the canals with the risk of contaminating drinking water. They demanded the formation of a supreme body of an independent veterinary medicine which should not have a relationship with the Ministry of Agriculture. The said body should follow this crisis, monitor the implementation of strict quarantine measures, the fulfillment of internationally recognised requirements for imports of animals, proper vaccination policy including punishment of those who who refuse vaccination of their animals, payments of appropriate compensation to farmers, provision of vaccines -- in case necessary, rapidly importing them, and the establishment of advanced laboratories for the manufacture of the necessary vaccines.

The Speaker of the People's Assembly, Dr. Mohammed Saad Katatni, will refer the raised issues to the Committee on Agriculture which is requested to prepare a scientific report containing the recommendations for submission to the Council.

[Information from WRLFMD (Pirbright) on the identification of the Egyptian FMDV serotype(s)/strains currently circulating in Egypt, their genotyping results, in particular indicating the vaccine strains most suitable to be applied, are expected the earliest. Egypt, one of the founders of the OIE in 1924, is expected to duly notify the OIE about this, seemingly major, epizootic which started in February (or earlier?).

WRLFMD findings on the FMDV SAT2 strain, currently circulating in neighbouring Libya, are similarly requested. Libya's OIE report of 12 Mar 2012 is available at http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=11741. - Mod.AS]
