[It should not come as a surprise that another outbreak of classical swine fever (CSF) was reported in the very same zone where another one occurred just one month ago [report date 16 Oct 2013].

For background information on recent and previous CSF outbreaks in the Amur Oblast area, see commentary in ProMED-mail post: 20131016.2005659.

According to the WAHID database, the outbreak reported on 16 Oct 2013, located in Amur Oblast in the Romnensky district, was resolved. A final report was sent to the OIE on 17 Oct 2013; see details of the final report at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000014254_20131017_150419.pdf. It seems premature for a veterinary service to close an event for outbreaks such as CSF just one day after it was reported to the OIE.
