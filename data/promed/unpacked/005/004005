An outbreak of severe enteritis in pigs
---------------------------------------
Since mid May 2004, numerous pig farms in the Iblin area [Northern Israel]
have suffered outbreaks of severe gastroenteritis causing high mortality in 1-
2-week-old piglets (case-fatality rate exceeding, in some litters, 50
percent), as well as agalactia [absence of milk] in lactating sows.
The Kimron Veterinary Institute reported the detection of a corona
virus as the causative agent in affected animals. This virus is known
as the etiologic agent of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) in
pigs. The disease is spreading rapidly among the farms. Instructions
regarding the control of the disease to minimize losses have been
disseminated by the State Veterinary Services to pig producers and
practitioners. At present, no TGE vaccine is certified in Israel.
Control is to be achieved by symptomatic treatment, while prevention
will be accomplished by controlled exposure of sows to infected
material, during their last pregnancy month, to induce high antibody
levels and obtain passive protection of neonates.

[The following information is derived from OIE's Manual of Standards,
Diagnostic Tests, and Vaccines 2000, Chapter 2.6.4 (Updated 22 Apr
2002):
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00085.htm>
"Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) is an enteric disease of pigs
caused by TGE virus (TGEV), a member of the Coronaviridae. TGEV
multiplies in, and damages the enterocyte lining of, the small
intestine, producing villous atrophy and enteritis. Diarrhea and
vomiting occur in pigs of all ages; mortality is highest in neonates.
Extra-intestinal sites of virus multiplication include the
respiratory tract and mammary tissues, but the virus is most readily
isolated from the intestinal tract and from feces.
As TGE is a contagious disease that can occur as explosive
epizootics, rapid diagnostic methods for its confirmation are
particularly important. The disease can also take the form of a
low-level endemic problem of post-weaning diarrhea, which is more
difficult to diagnose.
Virus may be identified by virus isolation in tissue culture,
electron microscopy, various immunodiagnostic assays, and, more
recently, by specific detection of viral RNA. The most commonly
employed rapid assays are probably the immunodiagnostic ones,
particularly, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) on feces,
and fluorescent antibody tests on cryostat sections of intestine.
Detection of virus by reversed passive hemagglutination has also been
described. Another enteric disease, porcine epidemic diarrhea, is
caused by a serologically distinct coronavirus that, nevertheless,
has an identical appearance under the electron microscope.
Diagnostically, immune electron microscopy circumvents this problem."
It will be helpful to know which method(s) have been applied in the
identification of the Israeli disease agent.
TGE, a list B OIE disease, has not been reported in the past from Israel.
During 2003, the presence of TGE was reported by 9 OIE member countries:
Belarus, Croatia, France, Germany, Mexico, Romania, Russia, Slovenia, and
Taiwan. Lebanon is the only Middle-Eastern country where the disease has been
reported in recent years, namely during 1995-1998. Reportedly, the disease
has not been detected there since 1998. - Mod. AS].
