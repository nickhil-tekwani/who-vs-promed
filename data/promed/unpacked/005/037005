The report issued on 4 Jan 2007 includes a table specifying the following
details pertaining to each of the 111 outbreaks of Epizootic Hemorrhagic
Disease (EHD) recorded in cattle in Israel between 28 Aug 2006 (date of
start, 1st outbreak) and 17 Nov 2006 (date of start, last outbreak):
Province, District, Unit Type, Location, Latitude, Longitude, Start date,
End date, Affected Population (dairy cattle, beef cattle).

Most cases have taken place in the Jordan basin, particularly around the
Sea of Galilee, extending westwards into the valley of Yizreel and the
northern (Mediterranean) shore; see in the included map.

The given end date of the last recorded outbreak (Zippori) is 17 Dec 2006.
Epidemiological data:
Farm Type: Most Dairy, few Beef and Feedlot.
Breeds: mainly Holstein.
Age: from heifers and calves of 1 year onward.

Clinical signs:
General: Reduced milk production, anorexia, reduced rumination, fever,
weakness, dyspnea.
Oronasal symptoms: clear to purulent nasal discharge, salivation, nasal and
lips redness and scaling, tongue swelling and erosions.
Ocular lesions: conjunctival hyperemia, redness and oedema.
Gait symptoms: Stiff gait, lameness, muscle tremors, recumbency.
Different farmers and vets report different clinical signs; not all the
above clinical signs seen on the same farm. Duration of clinical disease:
Several to 14 days.
There has been morbidity of 10 to 40 percent, with very low mortality. No
cases seen in adjacent sheep and goat farms.

Diagnosis:
9 field samples sent to Pirbright Laboratory were found positive to EHD
serotype 7. (Egg passage was done in the Kimron Veterinary Institute -
Israel). All the sent samples were negative to bluetongue.

[This unusual outbreak of EHD seems to have terminated by now, apparently
in line with the familiar seasonal pattern of another orbivirus, namely
that causing bluetongue. The seasonality is regulated by the activity of
_Culicoides_ vectors. It remains to be seen during future vector-activity
seasons if the EHD virus (EHDV) becomes endemic in the area.

There has been unofficial information about the occurrence of a similar
disease in Jordanian cattle during August and September 2006. Official
confirmation or otherwise, and information (clinical? serology?) from other
countries in the region, will help.

EHD, until recently unknown as a disease entity in the Mediterranean basin
and the Near East, has been recorded during 2006 also in the Maghreb
countries Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. According to the Pirbright
reference laboratory, the EHD serotype in the Maghreb is strain 318
(suggested to be EHDV-9), while the Israeli isolate is EHDV-7. Studies into
the epidemiology of EHD and its vector(s) in this part of the world deserve
priority; the introduction of the virus into the Maghreb might herald
further spread northwards, following the recently observed pattern of BTV
spreading from North Africa to Spain, Portugal, the Balearic islands,
Sardinia, Corsica and, probably, Sicily.

The origin(s) of the 2 EHDV serotypes which have affected the Maghreb
countries and Israel, remain to be studied as well.

EHD complies with OIE's definition of an emerging disease, namely "a known
infection spreading to a new geographic area or population." - Mod.AS]
