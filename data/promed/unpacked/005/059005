The [Australian] Gold Coast is under threat from deadly whooping cough with a dramatic rise in the number of cases reported in 2012. As of 13 Feb 2012, Queensland Health reported 876 cases of whooping cough (medical name pertussis) across the state since the beginning of 2012, that was almost 200 more cases than the average reported during the same period between 2007 and 2011.

Gold Coast Population Health Unit physician Doctor Don Staines, based at Robina Hospital, said 15 to 20 cases of the highly contagious disease were reported to him each week. Dr Staines said he was not surprised by the recent outbreaks. "We've been in a significant pertussis event for 3 years, which basically says there have been increased cases across the community," he said. He added that the Coast community needed to be extra wary of the disease as [pertussis] immunizations did not necessarily last as long as other, more common vaccines.

[It is not clear how many of the cases have occurred in the high risk group, infants under 6 months of age. The commonest complications of pertussis infection, especially in young infants, include apnea [stopping breathing], pneumonia, and weight loss secondary to feeding difficulties and post-coughing vomiting. Seizures and death also occur. Other complications include difficulty sleeping, pneumothorax, nose bleeds, subconjunctival hemorrhage, intracranial hematoma, rectal prolapse, urinary incontinence, and rib fracture. The overall complication rate of pertussis is 5-6 per cent, but among infants younger than 6 months, the complication rate can be 3-4 times that number.

Recommendations on the use of "cocooning" acellular pertussis vaccines in the USA have been developed in an attempt to expand protection in susceptibles to prevent the substantial morbidity and mortality in infants who have not yet been adequately immunized. The now recommended use of the vaccine in pregnant women further expands these recommendations.

Susceptibility of older children and adults to pertussis, usually manifesting as chronic cough without the typical "whoop," after appropriate primary immunization continues to be increasingly reported. Waning immunity is generally thought to be the cause of the problem, but other issues may be at work. - Mod.LL]
