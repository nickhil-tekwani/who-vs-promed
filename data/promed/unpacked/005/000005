Wildlife officials have confirmed the presence of avian cholera in geese from western Gibson County. Diagnostic testing was conducted at the US Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center.

Avian cholera is common among North American waterfowl, although the Gibson County detection is the 1st time the disease has been documented in wild birds in Indiana.

In total about 350 birds -- mostly snow geese -- have been found dead since the beginning of December [2017]. Tens of thousands of waterfowl spend winter in this part of the state, so the incidence of disease appears to be very low.

Avian cholera poses minimal risk to humans or to the commercial poultry industry, but it is highly contagious among wild birds, especially waterfowl. It is caused by the bacterium _Pasteurella multocida_ and is unrelated to avian influenza.

The DNR [Department of Natural Resources], together with federal and private partners, has increased surveillance of waterfowl populations throughout the state and is carefully removing and disposing of carcasses to decrease the risk of transmission to other birds.

Avian cholera spreads through bird-to-bird contact, ingestion of food and water containing the infectious bacterium, and scavenging of infected carcasses. Infected birds often die quickly, but might appear sluggish and otherwise exhibit abnormal behavior. While the disease could result in high mortality rates in small areas, it is not expected to have a significant effect on overall waterfowl populations.

To help prevent the spread of avian cholera, waterfowl hunters in southwest Indiana should consider cleaning and disinfecting their gear, including waders and decoys, using warm, soapy water.

Waterfowl hunters should also use gloves when cleaning birds; avoid eating, drinking, or smoking during cleaning; and thoroughly wash their hands afterwards.

Animals known or suspected to be ill should not be consumed.

[Avian cholera is a disease caused by the bacteria _Pasteurella multocida_. Bacteria released into the environment by dead and dying birds, or by birds carrying the disease, can subsequently infect healthy birds. In addition, dense concentrations of waterfowl can enhance disease transmission to susceptible birds. As a result, avian cholera can spread quickly through a wetland, killing thousands of birds in a single outbreak. Pickup and disposal of carcasses has become the primary management strategy to reduce transmission to susceptible birds.

The relationship between avian cholera and environmental factors is not entirely clear-cut. Associations between outbreaks and drought are inconsistent. Some researchers found a positive correlation with precipitations. Others suggest that absence of rain lead to high concentration of waterfowl leading to unusual high mortality. - Mod.PMB
