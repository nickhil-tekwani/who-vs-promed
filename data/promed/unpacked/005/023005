A surge in the number of reported cases of BSE in Ireland produced the
highest monthly total this year. 14 cases were reported, nine more than
November of last year. The number of cows found with BSE has increased
sharply, moving close to the highest levels detected since the disease was
first identified in the State in 1989.
While there was no official comment from the Department of Agriculture and
Food, the figure, which brings the total number of BSE cases this year to
73, represents a setback in the fight to eradicate the disease. Cases for
the year look set to equal, if not exceed, last year's 80 - the highest
annual total on record since 1989.
Detected BSE cases remained under 20 annually until 1996 when it was
announced in the House of Commons in London there might be a link between
it and nvCJD, a similar type of disease found in humans. Cases reported to
the Irish authorities from August 1996 doubled and 18 cases were recorded
that November.
Since then, the monthly totals have remained below this level until this
month when a sudden surge was recorded. There is no known scientific reason
for this jump.
Four of the diseased cows were found in herds in Monaghan, two were in
herds in Cavan, Waterford, Limerick and Clare and there were cases in
single herds in Meath and Cork. The oldest victim of the disease detected
during the month was eight years old and the youngest were dairy cows found
in herds in Limerick and Waterford.
