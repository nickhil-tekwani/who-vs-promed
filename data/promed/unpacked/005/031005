So far 9 people out of 27 cases have died of an unidentified epidemic
that has hit the western Ugandan district of Kasese in recent weeks,
a district official has said.

Peter Mukobi, the district health officer, told Xinhua by telephone on
Wednesday [13 Aug 2008] that preliminary investigations show that the
outbreak may be typhoid but he is awaiting confirmatory results from
the country's central public [health] laboratory. He said that the
victims showed signs and symptoms of fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
and later constipation.

A medical team from the health ministry is already in the district
carrying out various tests and promoting proper hygiene and
sanitation as one of the measures to contain the spread of the
disease, he said.

"We are advising people to drink boiled water, wash hands after going
to the toilet, dispose off fecal matter properly, and generally
maintain proper hygiene," said Mukobi.

[ProMED-mail thanks Kate Kelley for this report.

Not enough information regarding the illness is given here but typhoid
fever should certainly be considered. A high case fatality rate (CFR)
-- 33 percent -- is not at all incompatible with typhoid infection
occurring in the absence of specific antimicrobial therapy in the
developing world. With appropriate treatment, the CFR should be less
than one percent.

The Kasese district of Uganda is located in the southwestern part of
this African nation, bordering to the west the Democratic Republic of
the Congo. Its location can be seen on a map at
