For the 1st time, anthrax has struck the Bondas, a primitive tribal
group with a population of 10 000. Doctors said as many as 10 are down
with the disease at Andrahal village in Malkangiri district's
Khairaput block. There are no reports of deaths yet. "Consumption of
beef of an anthrax-afflicted cow has led to the outbreak. Our medical
teams are regularly visiting the village for the past one week and
treating them. But the problem is that they like to depend on their
own primitive methods of treatment. So it takes a lot of persuasion
and coaxing before they can be taken to hospital," said a Khairput
hospital doctor. A health official said Bondas are strangers to the
disease and the symptoms. "They have no idea what kind of precautions
need to be taken either," he added.

Another official said Andhrahal shares a boundary with Koraput's
Lamtaput block, which is an anthrax-hit area. "Maybe inflow of
anthrax-afflicted cattle from Lamtaput to Andhrahal has spread the
disease," he added.

Healthcare is virtually non-existent in the village. All it has is an
Auxiliary Nursing Midwife centre. There is also a primary health
centre and an ayurvedic dispensary at Mudulipada, about 13 km from
Andrahal. "Since there is no doctor at Mudulipada, the centre is run
by a pharmacist," a source said. "An awareness drive should be
launched to save the primitive tribe from the disease," the source said.

Medical officials, however, claimed that medical teams are visiting
Bonda villages and distributing medicines. Bondas, one of the
primitive tribes in Orissa, live in the Bonda hills, which cover about
130 sq km in Mudulipada and Andrahal panchayats in Malkangiri. A
micro-project called Bonda Development Agency (BDA) has been in force
since 1977 for the tribe, the literacy rate of which is 7.8 per cent.

The state government has prepared an action plan to wipe out anthrax
that has struck the Bondas, a vanishing tribe. The disease has been
detected for the 1st time among the primitive tribe, whose population
is just over 6000. Doctors said 8 persons, including 2 women and a
10-year-old child, have been affected at Andrahal village in
Malkangiri's Khairaput block. There are no reports of deaths yet.

"Anthrax was never reported in Malkangiri. Consumption of beef of an
anthrax-afflicted cow has led to the outbreak. For the past few days,
our teams are visiting the village and treating the affected persons,"
additional district medical officer (ADMO) Malkangiri Ch Prabhakar
said. "We have prepared an action plan to contain the disease," he said.

After a news item "Anthrax afflicts Bondas in Malkangiri" was
published in TOI on Wed 17 Jun 2009, a team of doctors visited the
anthrax-hit Andrahal village and examined the infected on Thursday
before preparing the action plan.

The plan entails regular vaccination of cattle and launch of an
awareness programme in the Bonda villages, among others. "We have
launched an awareness drive about the disease among Bondas. The
tribals have been asked not to consume beef of dead cattle. Awareness
programmes about anthrax will be conducted at regular intervals.
Voluntary organizations may also be engaged to create awareness among
the Bondas against the disease. The veterinary department has been
asked to vaccinate cattle in the area. As the anthrax spores can
remain alive for around 60 years in the soil, the tribals have been
advised to bury cattle in deep ditches or burn them," the ADMO said.

"Andrahal shares a boundary with Koraput's Lamtaput block, which is an
anthrax hit area. Inflow of anthrax-afflicted cattle from Lamtaput to
Andhrahal has led to spread of the disease," he said.

[An account of the Bondas can be found in Oreissadiary.com at
<http://www.orissadiary.com/orissa_profile/tribal/Bondas.asp>:

The Bondas, who have lived in near isolation among the higher hills,
are a fiercely independent tribe. The Bondas, known as Remo(men), are
a small tribe of the type now often called Austro-Asiatic. They live
in the wild and mountainous region northwest of the Machakunda river,
and they have preserved themselves comparatively unaffected by the
march of civilization. They speak a different Austro-Asiatic language.

The inaccessibility of their abode separates them from other tribes of
the district The origin and affiliations of the Bondas are obscure,
but one may accept the possibility that they are members of a group of
Austro-Asiatic tribes which at some remote date took shelter in the
wild Jeypore hills. There is every reason to suppose that the Bondas
have changed very little during their long history.

Bondas are the oldest tribal people of the Malkangiri District. They
live in the mountains at a height of 3000 feet. In 1971, a census
their numbers was 5245, and in the 1981 census, they were 5895 in
number, but in the 1991 census, they had decreased to a number of
5129, in which males accounted for 2414 and females 2715.

They still practice the barter system, exchanging the produce of their
fields for articles of daily use. An interesting feature of the Bonda
marriage is that Bonda girls prefer to marry younger boys, so they may
have someone to earn for them in their old age.

As can be seen from our previous postings on anthrax in Orissa,
overflow of this disease into adjoining tribal areas is a
long-standing problem in this state. Unfortunately, the Orissa state
control programme, such as it is, is reactive. A structured proactive
programme such as they are proposing would be more cost effective,
both in the tribal areas as well as elsewhere. We wish them good luck!
