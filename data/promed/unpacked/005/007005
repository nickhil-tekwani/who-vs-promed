The deaths of 2 neighbourhood women in a span of 12 hours has spread panic in Vellaraiamman Koil village near Wallajahbad, Kancheepuram district.

A 45-year-old woman died around 5 p.m. on Friday [19 Oct 2012] evening, and around 5 a.m. on Saturday morning, her neighbour (50) also died. The women were down with fever during the past week, a villager said. For nearly a fortnight now, the village of about 250 houses has been in the throes of disease, with little respite. Most of the villagers work as agricultural labourers, lorry drivers, or construction workers. Many of them have been complaining of fever, achy joints and heaviness in the head over the past few days.

A lorry driver said, "I was sick for a week and then, my family members began taking ill. Some of us have been sick for more than 10 days now. Many villagers have gone to private hospitals for treatment as the services at the Wallajabad government hospital are not good enough," he said.

A councillor from the village alleged that patients who went to the hospital were given just tablets and not administered vaccines. "People go to the government hospital 1st, and when they do not get any better, they have no option but to go to private practitioners," he said. "I was sick for sometime, and I got treated at a private clinic. I can afford the treatment, but most villagers here are casual labourers. One woman died when she was being taken to a private hospital," he said.

A visit to the hospital revealed ailing villagers were not the only visitors there. Animals, including pigs, roamed about the premises. [The source article is accompanied by a photograph -- 2nd in a series -- illustrating this situation]. "Government officials exhort us to go to government hospitals, but we are not satisfied with the treatment there. Every house here has at least 2 to 3 sick people," a resident, said.

Health officials were huddled in a meeting all day. Several attempts to reach the officials yielded no response. On Saturday [20 Oct 2012], bleaching powder was sprayed near the hospital premises, and a medical camp was held. Meanwhile, 12 persons were admitted to hospitals in the western suburbs of Ambattur and Avadi. All of them showed mild symptoms of dengue fever, said local councillors. According to residents in these areas, garbage piles and open drains turn into breeding grounds for mosquitoes. A resident of Ambattur said the government had proposed an underground drainage scheme in 2001, but no work had been taken up on that front yet.

Director of public health R.T. Porkai Pandian said there were some cases of dengue fever in Wallajabad and Vellore, but he was unable to confirm the cases reported in Ambattur and Avadi.

[The description of the symptoms of this undiagnosed febrile illness is not sufficiently precise to suggest an aetiology. Dengue fever is the most likely and should be excluded before considering other possibilities. Chikungunya fever has been recorded in Tamil Nadu but is not a lethal disease by and large.

Kancheepuram is the administrative headquarters of Kanchipuram district in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu, located on the banks of the river Vegavathy. Kanchipuram is 72 km (45 miles) from Chennai, the capital city of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It can be located in the map of the state of Tamil Nadu at http://www.qsl.net/v/vu2sdu/tamil.html. - Mod.CP]

[As Mod.CP points out, the lack of additional information makes a specific diagnosis of these cases difficult. Dengue virus infections are one possibility, but no indication is made if there is laboratory confirmation of that diagnosis, nor is there evidence that the illnesses and deaths are due to virus infections and not due to some other type of pathogen. - Mod.TY
