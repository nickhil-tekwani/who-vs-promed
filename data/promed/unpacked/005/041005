Another case of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), subtype H5N1, was confirmed at a mixed farm in western Nova Scotia, which includes poultry and products for local sale.

According to a press release from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), the case was confirmed on [9 Feb 2022]. The size of the flock was not disclosed, nor were the species involved.

This latest case follows confirmed detections of the same strain of HPAI in Newfoundland and Labrador and more recently in wild birds, a backyard flock, and a commercial turkey farm in Nova Scotia, where 11 800 turkeys were affected.

To control any potential spread of the disease, the CFIA has imposed movement restrictions and is recommending enhanced biosecurity for other farms within the area.

At this time, some countries have applied temporary import restrictions with variable implications on products and regions in Canada, primarily limited to the export of some poultry products from Nova Scotia.

Affected producers and industry associations, as well as federal and provincial departments, are cooperating in the ongoing investigation with a common goal to protect human health, protect the health of Canadian poultry and, in the process, maintain market access for Canadian poultry products.

CFIA announced the latest case of HPAI on the same day the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) announced the virus had been detected in a commercial broiler flock in Fulton County, Kentucky, and a backyard flock in Fauquier County, Virginia.

An earlier case of HPAI was confirmed in a commercial turkey flock in Dubois County, Indiana. In that flock, 29 000 turkeys were affected.

Also, HPAI has been confirmed in wild birds in New Hampshire, Delaware, Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Florida.

State of Indiana response to highly pathogenic avian influenza in Dubois County
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Current situation:
Laboratory testing of a commercial flock of young turkeys in Dubois County has identified the H5 avian influenza virus. This is considered a presumptive positive case, and samples are being verified at the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Iowa. This is the 2nd farm (known as Dubois2) in Indiana to be diagnosed with avian influenza. Pending test results should indicate if the virus is the same as the index farm diagnosed on [9 Feb 2022] and if the virus is highly pathogenic.

The close proximity of the 2nd farm to the index site (Dubois1) means the established 10 km [6.2 mi] control area will remain the same.

The Dubois2 flock was tested after the owner noticed water consumption by the birds dropped dramatically (a clinical sign of avian influenza). The farm, already under quarantine, houses 26 473 birds.

The control area circle is primarily in Dubois County and a portion of northern Spencer County. All commercial poultry flocks (18 total) within the control area are under quarantine for the duration of this event (i.e., until the control area is lifted).

Poultry farms in the control area have completed the 1st round of surveillance testing for HPAI to ensure the virus is not present in the area beyond the index farm. Testing of the control area farms will continue on a weekly basis.

BOAH has established a surveillance zone around the control area to allow for additional monitoring for the presence of the virus in commercial poultry in the area. The zone extends an additional 10 km [6.2 mi] beyond the control area boundary. Commercial poultry operations in the surveillance zone are not under quarantine but will be tested regularly (at less-frequent intervals) until the control area is lifted.

BOAH staff continue to reach out to known hobby/backyard poultry owners in the control area to schedule testing of birds to ensure the virus is not present. To date, 25 hobby flocks have been sampled; laboratory testing is not yet complete. Hobby poultry owners in Southern Dubois County should contact BOAH.

The H5 avian flu outbreak began in Dubois County. Now a farm in another county has had a flu outbreak.

The Indiana Board of Animal Health confirms one turkey farm in Greene County tested positive for the same H5 avian flu infecting the farms in Dubois. Greene County is about 60 mi [97 km] north of Dubois. Denise Spears, public information director for the Indiana State Board of Animal Health, says the farms are not related.

Spears explains to WIBC News, "To our knowledge, these farms are not related in any way as far as their production practices go. So it's not what's suspected."

The board was informed by a veterinarian working with the Greene County farm that geese were in the area. Spears says geese could be the suspect behind this poultry problem.

"[And] we do know the H5N1 virus is carried by wild migratory waterfowl," Spears explains, "so it wouldn't be uncommon for this to be the source of bringing the virus onto a farm."

Spears says this virus is a challenging issue because the virus simply shouldn't be in Indiana, or the country, for that matter. It has to come from somewhere else.

Spears explains, "It's considered a foreign animal disease to us here in the United States, when we get a highly pathogenic version of the virus. So it's why we have to take such drastic action about it because this is not something that should be here."

Spears says the Board of Animal Health will set up essentially the same operation in Greene County as in Dubois. A 10 km [6.2 mi] zone has been established around the infected farm. All commercial poultry farms in the zone will go through a thorough cleaning process and remain under quarantine for several weeks. Over 60 000 birds at the infected farm have been "depopulated." That now brings the total number of infected turkeys to over 100 000.

As for the quarantined Dubois County farms, it's business as usual.

"It's going very well there," says Spears. "Tests continue to keep happening at the commercial poultry flocks in the county, as well as some backyard hobby flocks. So far, all of those have come back negative, which has made us very happy."

She once again stresses the fact this flu outbreak does not mean anything for the meat and eggs in your home.

"This is not a food safety issue; your eggs, your poultry, your chicken and turkey meat are all safe to eat. This virus is not spread that way, so don't be concerned in that way," explains Spears.

The presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has been confirmed in 2 new states, including the nation's largest poultry-producing state.

According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) website, new cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza have been discovered in Georgia and Connecticut. Additional cases have also emerged this week in North Carolina, Virginia, Delaware, and New Hampshire.

All of the new cases involve a Eurasian H5 lineage of the virus.

In Georgia, which, according to the USDA, is the nation's largest poultry producer, there have been 2 confirmed cases in hunter-harvested birds. One was a gadwall, and the other was an American widgeon. Both cases were confirmed in Hart County.

In Connecticut, there were 21 confirmed cases, all of which were in mallards. All but one of those cases were in Middlesex County, while the other was in New London County.

The most recent case in Virginia was found in a hunter-harvested gadwall, with Virginia Beach listed as the location. Three other cases were previously reported in the state.

Twenty-nine new cases of HPAI were detected in mallards in New Hampshire, all of which were in Rockingham County. This brings the state's total case count to 49.

Delaware has 5 new cases, all in Kent County. The cases involved hunter-harvested birds: 3 northern shovelers, 1 American black duck, and 1 gadwall.

North Carolina remains the state with the most cases in wild birds, with 50 being reported within the past week in a variety of duck species. Counties where the virus was detected include Pamlico, Hyde, Currituck, Craven, Beaufort, and Bladen.

With these latest detections, HPAI has been confirmed in 11 states in 2022. Those states are Indiana, Kentucky, New Hampshire, Delaware, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Florida. The only 2 states to have confirmed cases in commercial poultry are Indiana, with 2 turkey flocks affected, and Kentucky, with one broiler flock affected.

New York poultry farmers are asked to be on alert for a highly pathogenic avian influenza after it was detected in a small flock in Suffolk County.

According to a release from the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets, highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, was found among 8 birds, part of a non-commercial backyard flock.

Officials said samples from the flock were tested at 2 different laboratories.

The affected premises have been quarantined, and the remaining birds were to be "depopulated" to prevent the spread of the disease. Vermonters who raise turkeys or chickens are asked to be on alert for a highly pathogenic avian influenza after it was detected in some domestic flocks and wild birds in other states.

The virus has been detected at 2 commercial turkey farms in southern Indiana, a flock of commercial broiler chickens in Kentucky, and a backyard flock of mixed species birds in northern Virginia.

In 2015, a widespread bird flu outbreak killed 50 million birds across 15 states and cost the federal government nearly USD 1 billion.

The strain now circulating is H5N1 and is related to the 2015 virus. It has been circulating for months in Europe and Asia and was found in wild birds in Canada a few weeks ago and in a commercial flock in Canada a week before the 1st US case was identified.

US surveillance efforts have identified the virus in wild birds in recent weeks in New Hampshire, Delaware, North Carolina, Virginia, Florida, and South Carolina.

Anyone involved with poultry production should review their biosecurity activities to ensure the health of their birds, restrict human movement onto the farm, and limit contact with poultry to only those who need to be there.

Bird owners should also prevent contact between their birds and wild birds and report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to state or federal officials.

Health officials say no human cases of avian influenza viruses have been detected in the US, and the disease doesn't present an immediate public health concern.

The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in a non-commercial backyard flock (non-poultry) in Suffolk County, New York.

Samples from the flock were tested at the Cornell University Animal Health Diagnostic Center, part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, and confirmed at the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa.

APHIS is working closely with state animal health officials in New York on a joint incident response. State officials quarantined the affected premises, and birds on the properties will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from the flock will not enter the food system.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the recent HPAI detections in birds do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States. As a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 deg F [74 deg C] kills bacteria and viruses.

As part of existing avian influenza response plans, federal and state partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flock. The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets, and migratory wild bird populations.

Anyone involved with poultry production from the small backyard to the large commercial producer should review their biosecurity activities to assure the health of their birds. APHIS has materials about biosecurity, including videos, checklists, and a toolkit available at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/defend-the-flock-program/dtf-resources/dtf-resources.

USDA will report these findings to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) as well as international trading partners. USDA also continues to communicate with trading partners to encourage adherence to OIE standards and minimize trade impacts. OIE trade guidelines call on member countries to not impose bans on the international trade of poultry commodities in response to such notifications in non-poultry.

APHIS will continue to announce the 1st case of HPAI in commercial and non-commercial backyard flocks detected in a state but will not announce subsequent detections in the state. All cases in commercial and non-commercial backyard flocks will be listed on the APHIS website at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/2022-hpai.

In addition to practicing good biosecurity, all bird owners should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds and report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to state/federal officials, either through their state veterinarian or through APHIS' toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593. APHIS urges producers to consider bringing birds indoors, when possible, to further prevent exposures. The Animal Health Protection Act authorizes APHIS to provide indemnity payments to producers for birds and eggs that must be depopulated during a disease response. APHIS also provides compensation for disposal activities and virus elimination activities. Additional information on biosecurity for non-commercial backyard flocks can be found at http://healthybirds.aphis.usda.gov.

Avian influenza (AI) is caused by an influenza type A virus, which can infect poultry (such as chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, domestic ducks, geese, and guinea fowl) and is carried by free-flying waterfowl such as ducks, geese, and shorebirds. AI viruses are classified by a combination of 2 groups of proteins: hemagglutinin, or "H" proteins, of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and neuraminidase, or "N" proteins, of which there are 9 (N1-N9). Many different combinations of "H" and "N" proteins are possible. Each combination is considered a different subtype and can be further broken down into different strains that circulate within flyways/geographic regions. AI viruses are further classified by their pathogenicity (low or high), the ability of a particular virus strain to produce disease in domestic poultry.

[Avian influenza is on the move. It continues to move across the United States. Everyone must be diligent about biosecurity of the birds. Be on the alert for ill birds in your flock, and notice if there are ill birds in flocks that you may be hunting. If you are able, bring your birds inside. They can be in your garage, or something like a back room. Even in winter, birds will need some type of ventilation, so a fan may be needed, but, of course, severe cold is always an issue as well. The point is to do what is necessary to protect your birds. - Mod.TG
