Three brands of cheese were pulled from grocery stores Wednesday as one of
Canada's worst outbreaks of _Salmonella_ poisoning took yet another twist and
showed few signs of slowing down. Scientists have found bacteria in a vat
of cheese made by Parmalat Canada of Toronto and believe it may be linked
to salmonella found in Lunchmate products made by Kitchener's J.M.
Schneider Inc.
Dr. Andrea Ellis of Health Canada in Guelph was quoted as saying, "It's an
interesting development because it's highly unusual to find this kind of
salmonella in cheese. It just shouldn't be there."
According to this story, there have now been 580 confirmed cases of
salmonella across Canada, of which 402 were from Ontario.
Ellis was further quoted as saying, "I personally have never worked on
anything quite this involved. It's amazing how complex our food system is,
especially when dealing with processed foods."
Investigators believe they have traced the entire contents of the
contaminated vat of Parmalat cheese. Most is still at the plant, but some
had already been shipped to Schneiders. None made it into stores.
However, other vats of cheese made at the same time were shipped out to
distributors and retailers. It's not known if those vats were contaminated
as well, but Parmalat is recalling the products to be safe.
