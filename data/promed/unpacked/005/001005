[A] potato blight warning [was] issued for Ireland. National meteorological service Met Eireann [Irish National Meteorological Service] have issued an environmental warning to the whole country, predicting a 'Blight Warning' which could start with some bad weather this week.

The warning states that "Weather conditions conducive to the spread of potato blight will occur this weekend [13-14 Jun 2020]." Despite high temperatures, the weather will remain cloudy and muggy with light showers, conditions the blight disease thrives in.

This news has just solidified the idea that 2020 is a cursed year.

Potato growers across the UK should be on high alert for blight. Rain coupled with warming temperatures have heightened the threat across many key growing regions. Growers are being urged to protect their crops with robust blight prevention programmes.

The Blightwatch alert system, hosted by AHDB [Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board] and the MET Office [Meteorological Office], has displayed red warnings since [11 Jun 2020] -- indicating the highest level of threat -- just as many crops are reaching the crucial growth stage. Red alerts have been issued in England for Lincolnshire, Yorkshire, Lancashire, East Anglia, and across the West Midlands. In Scotland, fewer warnings indicate the same urgency of the blight programme, and also in Wales.

The threat of blight will develop quickly in warm, wet weather, particularly with latent blight present in volunteer potatoes from fields that were abandoned following a difficult harvesting campaign in 2019. The challenge is intensifying with the widespread presence of newer, more aggressive strains which make vigilance ever more important.

[Late blight of potato (PLB) and tomato is caused by the fungus-like organism (oomycete) _Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100% crop loss. The pathogen can also affect some other solanaceous crops. In potato, it affects leaves as well as tubers; in tomato, it causes lesions and rotting of leaves, stems, and fruits. The disease is favoured by cool, moist conditions. It can spread rapidly within a crop and destroy it within a few days. Under favourable conditions, epidemics in tomatoes may be even more rapid than in potatoes.

The pathogen is spread by plant material (including potato seed tubers, tomato transplants, plant debris, volunteer crop plants), mechanical means (including human and insect activities), wind, and water. Disease management requires an integrated approach and may include removal of pathogen reservoirs, crop rotation, preventative fungicide treatments of planting material, as well as fungicide sprays of crops. Farm-saved or uncertified seed tubers have often been reported as sources of PLB outbreaks. Certified clean planting stock and management strategies for fungicide resistance of the pathogen are considered vital to control late blight outbreaks. Commercial crop cultivars vary in susceptibility to late blight. Development of resistant cultivars is being counteracted by the adaptability of the pathogen.

Late blight is considered an increasing problem worldwide. Considerable variation in aggressiveness between different pathogen strains has been observed, but more virulent strains are emerging frequently. Presence of both A1 and A2 mating types of the pathogen increases the chances of strains with additional fungicide resistances and increased yield losses to develop.

In Europe, regional differences in pathogen population diversity no longer exist and increasingly virulent strains have been reported to emerge mainly on potato (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives), but recently also on tomato (ProMED-mail post 20180611.5850443). In the UK, the new strain '36_A2' that arrived in the country in 2017 from continental Europe, was the most frequently detected during a surge of PLB in 2019 (ProMED-mail post 20190712.6562717). It has now also been recorded in Ireland (see link to genotype map below).
