The North Dakota Department of Health is investigating a cluster of possible acute (meaning recent infection) hepatitis C virus (HCV) cases in Ward County. As of Fri 6 Sep 2013, there are 7 cases identified in 3 women and 4 men, all older than 60.

Most of the hepatitis C cases reported to the Department of Health are categorized as chronic cases, meaning the patients may have been infected years ago and may or may not have ever experienced symptoms of the disease. A case categorized as acute means the person was recently infected. At the start of this investigation, 3 acute cases were diagnosed within a few months and within the same geographic area. This cluster of acute cases is unusual to appear in North Dakota, and thus an investigation was initiated to determine whether there is a possible connection between these cases.

Testing has indicated that the virus from the 1st 3 cases is genetically linked; additional cases identified through our investigation are genetically linked as well. Cases that are genetically linked could indicate a possible common source. However, at this time, no source has been identified. Health officials are currently working to identify how these individuals were exposed and whether there is a common source. Moving forward, any possible associations between these cases will be evaluated. Additional people who may have events or activities in common with these cases may also be tested for hepatitis C. Those who are considered at risk will be contacted by phone or mail and given guidance about testing procedures. If you are not contacted regarding testing, there is no recommended action to take.

It's important to note that hepatitis C is not spread easily from person to person and is not spread through the air when people cough or sneeze. Hepatitis C is spread primarily through direct exposure to blood or blood products from an infected person. Anyone can get hepatitis C, but those at greater risk include:
- Current or past injection drug users.
- Recipients of blood and/or solid organs before 1992.
- Recipients of clotting factors (products given to help blood clot) made before 1987.
- Hemodialysis patients.
- Infants born to infected mothers.

Hepatitis C is a viral infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis C virus. Hepatitis C can lead to lifelong (chronic) infection and can cause serious liver damage (cirrhosis or liver cancer) and death. About 80 percent of people infected with HCV have mild or no signs or symptoms initially. Symptoms may include tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea, abdominal discomfort, vomiting, dark urine or jaundice (i.e., yellowing of skin or whites of eyes). Some people recover fully, but 55 percent to 85 percent of infected people carry the virus in their blood for a lifetime and develop chronic infection.

Health officials will continue to investigate these cases and conduct testing of individuals as necessary. Additional testing will help to determine whether there is a connection between the confirmed cases and whether there are other people in the community who have been infected. As the investigation continues, updates will be released on this website and through media outlets.

People who have hepatitis C should remain aware that their blood and possibly other body fluids are potentially infective. Care should be taken to avoid blood exposure to others by not sharing toothbrushes, razors, needles, or any other objects that may have become contaminated with blood. In addition, infected people must not donate blood and should inform their health-care providers so that proper health care can be provided.

On Thu 17 Oct 2013, the North Dakota Department of Health received confirmation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that testing had been completed on blood samples from additional individuals in the hepatitis C outbreak investigation in Ward County. The CDC has confirmed that 21 additional cases are related to the 7 cases that had previously been identified, bringing the total number of related cases to 28. In addition, as the investigation progresses, more people will likely be tested.

According to Tracy Miller, State Epidemiologist with the North Dakota Department of Health, the state is receiving assistance in this investigation from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CDC personnel are in Minot to assist state investigators. As this investigation proceeds, the Department of Health will continue to provide updates to the public as to the course of the investigation.

For members of the public who may have additional questions about either this outbreak or hepatitis C in general, the Department of Health has activated their public health hotline. The hotline will be open from 8 am to 5 pm weekdays. The hotline can be contacted by calling toll-free 1-866-207-2880 during business hours.

Information will also be available on the Department of Health's Facebook page and on Twitter, with the hashtag "#ndhepc." For more information, contact Tracy Miller, North Dakota Department of Health, at 701-328-2378. Information about HCV can be found by visiting http://www.ndhealth.gov/disease/Hepatitis/.

[The 2nd press release unfortunately provides no additional information to resolve the possibilities listed in the 1st news release. This cluster of acute cases of hepatitis C virus infection may be a consequence of either current or past injected drug use, receipt of blood and/or solid organs before 1992, receipt of clotting factors made before 1987, or hemodialysis. Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP
