The ship at the centre of a Legionnaires' Disease scare has been given the
all-clear by health officials and is due to leave Greenock at about 5pm today.
The SS Edinburgh Castle has spent two days docked at Greenock's Ocean
Terminal to allow the vessel's water supply system to be disinfected under
the supervision of Inverclyde Council's incident control team.
