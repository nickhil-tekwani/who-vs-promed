Nigeria: Local Governments in Jigawa State Battle Measles Outbreak
------------------------------------------------------------------
Some local government areas in Jigawa State that share borders with
Niger Republic are battling measles outbreaks suspected to have been
contracted from the neighbouring country. Though no death has been
recorded, health workers in the local governments have been battling
the killer disease with massive inoculation and mass mobilisation.
[However, the final paragraph states that fatalities have occurred in
Jigawa state, presumably earlier in 2008 or elsewhere in the state. - Mod.CP]

When This Day visited Sule Tankarkar, one of the affected local
governments, the Chairman, Alhaji Mohammed Abdullahi Mujitaba
confirmed the outbreak but disclosed that no life has been lost so
far because the council was on top of the situation. "We started
receiving reports at the beginning of the month [May 2008]. But we
swung into action immediately. So far, we have administered over 75
000 doses of vaccine to children in the affected areas. And, because
of the stifling heat which we are experiencing right now, we are also
taking preventive action against the outbreak of Cerebral Spinal
Meningitis (CSM)," he explained.

In Babura local government, the Chairman of the council Alhaji Aminu
Ahmed disclosed that his council is collaborating with its
counterpart in Niger Republic to arrest the situation. "Because of
our proximity to Niger Republic, it is natural to suspect that the
outbreak may have been imported. But it is also possible that we may
export to that country as well. So, we are collaborating with
authorities in Niger to fight the outbreak. And this cooperation is
working well as we are bringing the situation under control," he said.

Jigawa State has recorded several fatalities from measles this year
[2008]. The government had taken the scourge head-on, reducing the
incidents significantly and there are hopes that the present
outbreaks would soon be contained.

activities in the African Region up to 2005 can be found in the
ProMED-mail post titled: "Measles, control activities - Africa:
1999-2005 20060921.2700". Up to that time Niger Republic was ranked
ahead of Nigeria in terms of progress towards elimination of measles.
