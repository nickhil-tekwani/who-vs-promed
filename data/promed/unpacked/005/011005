Cattle owners in two areas of Swaziland affected by the foot and mouth
disease or FMD have complained bitterly against a government order to kill
their animals without compensation. The cattle farmers have not taken
kindly to the order by the veterinary department of the ministry of
agriculture and co-operatives, saying this was unfair because they depended
entirely on cattle for their livelihood. Swazi Prime Minister, Sibusiso
Dlamini, had to intervene to assure the affected farmers that compensation
would be paid after consultations with the chiefs. The farmers complaint
followed a government order issued Friday that 2300 head of cattle infected
by FMD at Mafucula should be killed with immediate effect.
The order calls for the immediate destruction of all animals or stock
"which have been in the area herewith declared a quarantined area and
bordered by the redline in the west, the Mbuluzi River in the south, the
Swaziland/Mozambican border in the east and Swaziland/South African
border." This order follows the outbreak of FMD at Tsambokhulu and Mafuculu
both areas situated in the northeastern part of Lubombo region of Swaziland.
It is believed that livestock from these areas contracted the disease from
cattle from Mbuzini in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa. Cattle owners
from these 2 Swazi areas sometimes graze in South Africa after cutting the
boundary fence. Lubombo regional veterinary officer, Dr. Mphumuzi Sukati,
said the infected cattle were identified from about 12 000 which were
inspected at Tsambokhulu. According to the order, the destruction of the
animals would be done in the most human way through shooting or stunning by
the veterinary, police or army personnel.
The order further states that owners of all infected and suspected stock
and stock that have been exposed to FMD infection shall keep such stock in
a separate place to prevent further infection of the stock. Farmers are
also ordered to prevent their infected stock from leaving the places where
they are isolated or kept away from healthy animals. That includes
avoiding taking the infected animals to dipping tanks. The order goes on to
say that owners of such stock should immediately inform their neighbours
and the nearest veterinary authorities or security personnel. It prohibits
the taking of infected animals anywhere within 100 metres from any public
road in the quarantined areas unless they are kept or confined in a kraal
or stable.

[Foot and Mouth Disease is extremely contagious. Humans can carry the virus
on their feet, clothing and even their pharynx. The Foot and Mouth Disease
virus can also be spread by the wind. While the disease control people on
the ground almost always have a better picture, let's hope these measures
indicated by the article will be enough to control the disease. - Mod.PC
