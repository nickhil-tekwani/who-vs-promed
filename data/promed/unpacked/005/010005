The real cause of a deadly disease ravaging eastern Uttar Pradesh for
the past 3 decades still remains a mystery. Despite claiming close to
100 lives up to Monday [26 Jul 2010], and with another 550 admitted in
the hospitals, scientists and doctors are still groping in the dark
over the identity of the viral strain.

"We are sure about one thing, that it is not Japanese encephalitis
virus. Only 11.71 per cent of the samples have tested positive for
Japanese encephalitis virus, while the rest are still unknown,"
claimed director general (medical & health) Dr RR Bharti.

When even the local unit of the National Institute of Virology (NIV)
Pune, based in Gorakhpur, failed to arrive at any conclusion, Bharti
requested the Union Health Ministry to intervene. A team of Union
Health Ministry officials and scientists from the Indian Council of
Medical Research (ICMR) -- along with Bharti and Dr SP Ram -- visited
Gorakhpur on Saturday [24 Jul 2010]. However, they also failed to
diagnose the viral strain causing deaths of children in the region.
"At times, it shows symptoms of an enterovirus [meningitis?] but not
uniformly, so we cannot arrive at any concrete conclusion," said Bharti.

Meanwhile, the official daily bulletin at the State Health Directorate
reported 94 deaths due to the mystery virus, with another 543 admitted
to hospital.

On the other hand, the State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) and nearly
half a dozen public representatives have raised [questions] about the
functioning of the Health Department. SHRC has sought explanation from
the Health Department over the rising number of children's deaths in
Gorakhpur region. "We have no answer about this disease, which is
locally referred to as Japani bukhar. It is being called acute
encephalitis syndrome (AES) by medical experts. We are just providing
preventive measures taken by the department to the concerned
authorities," said a senior health official.

According to the figures at the Control Room in Lucknow, 543 children
are suffering from AES as of Mon 26 Jul 2010. Another 94 have died,
while 10 have tested positive for Japanese encephalitis virus
infection. One child has died due to Japanese encephalitis in
Gorakhpur also.

Local health activist Dr RN Singh claimed that "The actual number of
deaths have surpassed 100 in Gorakhpur region."

State health officials have issued directives that the children be
treated at the local health centre level. In a letter by Bharti,
district health officials in Purvanchal have been directed to refer
only serious cases to Baba Raghav Das Medical College in Gorakhpur.
"When the medical college has failed to diagnose the disease, it is
simply not possible that local health centres provide proper
healthcare to these children," said RN Singh.

Meanwhile, state health officials narrate their efforts in combating
the Japanese encephalitis menace. A separate ward with 126 beds has
been constructed at a cost of Rs 5.88 crore [USD 1.26 million]. Nearly
3.5 crore [35 million] children were vaccinated against Japanese
encephalitis in 2009. An extensive awareness campaign has been
launched in the region, with special emphasis on sanitation and
cleanliness.

[Previously, in mid-April 2010, Mod.TY commented that the region of
Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh reported over 500 encephalitis cases last
year (2009), some due to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and others
were described as acute encephalitis of undefined etiology but not due
to JEV infections. There is no information indicating how many of
these current cases are due to JEV and how many to another etiological
agent, perhaps enteroviruses or Nipah virus.

There appears to have been little progress in establishing the
identity of the non-Japanese encephalitis virus presumed to be
responsible for as many as 88 percent of cases of acute pediatric
illness in Uttar Pradesh. The undiagnosed illness has been graced with
the designation acute encephalitis syndrome, but it is unclear whether
a single etiological agent is responsible for this condition. Further
information would be welcomed.

Uttar Pradesh is located in the northern part of India. With a
population of over 190 million people, it is India's most populous
state. A map showing the locations of the Indian states can be
