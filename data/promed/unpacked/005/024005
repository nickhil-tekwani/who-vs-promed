Certain changes in the clinical profile of encephalitis patients in
eastern UP this year have become a new cause of concern for the
doctors. Apart from the usual high fever and convulsions, the doctors
have noticed that most patients are now taking longer to recover,
having rashes all over their body and also heart inflation [sic].

As encephalitis patients are given symptomatic treatment, changes in
the clinical profile have been noticed by the doctors at Gorakhpurâ€™s
BRD Medical College, which receives patients from all over eastern UP.
They are now planning to bring out a clinical paper on the subject and
also study the subject.

"Patients coming to us this year are more serious as their illness has
become prolonged now. Till last year [2010], the average stay of an
encephalitis patient at the hospital used to be 2 weeks, but the
recovery time has increased to 3 weeks this year. Symptoms like high
fever and convulsions continue for 3 weeks now. Besides, children are
coming with rashes all over their body and inflation of the heart,"
said Dr KP Kushwaha, head of the Pediatrics Department at BRD Medical
College. "Rashes used to be there in some cases and even heart
inflation, but it was very rare. Now more and more patients are coming
in with these complaints and we are observing and analysing the
situation," said Dr Kushwaha.

Over the last few years, after Japanese encephalitis (JE) [virus
infection] cases started declining following regular vaccination, the
clinical profile of the patients had remained almost the same; the
only change has been a slight increase in the number of adult
patients. This is for the 1st time that doctors have noticed major
changes in the clinical profile of the patients.

Denying any possibility of mutation in the virus, Dr MM Gore, senior
scientist at the National Institute of Virology, who is also in charge
of the NIV field laboratory at Gorakhpur, said: "It is too early to
come to any conclusion, because even doctors are still observing the
clinical changes". He added: "As far as I have come to know, symptoms
of JE patients remain the same and it is the other forms of
encephalitis where doctors have observed changes in the clinical
profile."

The problem with the experts is that apart from the JE virus, the
viruses affecting the majority of the patients have not yet been
identified. For this reason, all non-JE patients are grouped together
in a category called acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). The lack of
identification of AES viruses makes it difficult to ascertain the
causes behind these clinical changes.

"It is too early to conclude anything. After the outbreak is over in
the next few days, we will analyse the data. The treatment in the
meantime will not be a problem because patients are given symptomatic
treatment which can change with the change in the clinical profile,"
said a health official.

[The above comments point out the problem with the reports on acute
encephalitis syndrome coming out of northeastern India and are on
target -- there is no etiological diagnosis for many, perhaps the
majority, of encephalitis cases that have occurred there this year
(2011). Previous reports often mention an association of non-JE virus
cases with contaminated water, suggesting one or more enteroviruses.
Other reports indicate that all cases are due to JE virus infection.
Adequate virological diagnosis is critically needed to understand the
situation there, and plan for prevention and control, as well as to
better understand the changes in the clinical picture described in the
above report.

ProMED thanks Ronan Kelly for sending in this report.
