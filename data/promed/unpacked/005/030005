Highly pathogenic avian influenza, Israel
-----------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 13 Oct 2020 from Dr. Tamir Goshen, Acting Director, Veterinary Services and Animal Health, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Beit Dagan, Israel

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 12 Oct 2020
Date of confirmation of the event: 13 Oct 2020
Reason for notification: Recurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 3 Feb 2020
Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease
Causal agent: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H5N8
Nature of diagnosis: Clinical, laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Maanit, Hadera, Haifa
Date of start of the outbreak: 12 Oct 2020
Outbreak status: Resolved (14 Oct 2020)
Epidemiological unit: Farm

Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Birds / 35 000 / 2000 / 800 / 34 200 / 0
Affected population: 48-week-old heavy breeders. The farm is divided into 4 pens. The morbidity and mortality occurred in one-half of a divided pen. The farm is situated near fishponds; it is the season of birds' migration, and aquatic migrating birds are resting and feeding in these ponds.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds / 5.71 / 2.29 / 40 / 100
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Most likely by wild migrating birds
Epidemiological comments: Epidemiological investigation is ongoing. The last time that the virus was diagnosed in Israel was in January 2020 in a Bonelli's eagle in the desert. The last time that it was diagnosed in a commercial farm was in the north of the country in April 2019, in a turkey farm.

Control measures
Measures applied: Movement control inside the country, quarantine, zoning, vaccination prohibited, no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: Surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; stamping out; disinfection

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Kimron Veterinary Institute, Avian Diseases Laboratory (national laboratory) / Birds / Pathogen isolation by egg inoculation / 13 Oct 2020 / Positive
Kimron Veterinary Institute, Avian Diseases Laboratory (national laboratory) / Birds / Real-time reverse transcriptase / polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 13 Oct 2020 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[This outbreak was already published in ProMED-mail 20201013.785921. The following has been extracted from the OIE Avian Influenza Portal (https://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/avian-influenza-portal/what-is-avian-influenza/):

Several factors can contribute to the spread of avian influenza viruses, such as:
- Globalization and international trade;
- Farming and sale (live bird markets);
- Wild birds and migratory routes.

Wild birds, as natural host and reservoir for all types of avian influenza viruses, play a major role in the evolution, maintenance, and spread of these viruses. The main wild species involved have proved to be waterfowls, gulls, and shorebirds; however, the virus seem to pass easily between different bird species.

The incidence of infection appears to be seasonal, with the highest isolation rate being in juvenile birds in the fall of the year. Several routes of exposure of wild bird viruses to poultry have been documented or suspected of being the origins of outbreaks. Direct exposure to wild birds is the most likely transmission factor.

Therefore, limiting exposure of poultry to wild birds through confinement rearing and other biosecurity measures provides an opportunity to reduce the risk of introduction of avian influenza virus from wild birds, and consequently is key to decrease the risk of evolution into highly pathogenic forms, exposure and infection of humans, and recombination with human viruses' components to form viruses that can not only infect humans but readily transmit among humans. - Mod.CRD
