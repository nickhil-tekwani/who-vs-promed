It is feared the green lipped mussel industry could suffer a massive blow
if the toxic algal bloom sweeping down the North Island crosses the Cook
Strait. Most of the North Island's west coast has been closed for shellfish
gathering after tests showed high levels of the algal species, _Gymnodinium
catenatum_, present in shellfish.
Infected shellfish have also been detected in Wellington Harbour in an area
stretching from Breaker Bay to Red Rocks on the southern coastline. It is
also present to the west, along Makara Beach and Titahi Bay in Porirua
Harbour. The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research says last
weekend's stormy weather did not appear to hinder the build-up of the algal
species in the Wellington region.
The toxic bloom has potentially fatal consequences if infected shellfish
are eaten.

A ProMED-mail post

[Red tide is caused by an organism called _Gymnodinium breve_ that in high
concentration can make the water look red. The organism releases a toxin
paralyzing the respiratory system of fish and other marine life. This
particular species of _Gymnodinium_ is probably similar in that it poses a
threat to the mussel industry and to humans consuming the shellfish. - Mod.TG
