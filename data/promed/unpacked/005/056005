A Montezuma County man who died suddenly 19 Oct [2010] had contracted
[a] hantavirus [infection] from rodent feces and urine, a Colorado
Department of Public Health and Environment veterinarian said Friday
[29 Oct 2010]. [Laboratory] tests confirmed Friday the cause of
death, Elisabeth Lawaczeck said. She couldn't release personal
information, but she said the victim, 35, worked at least part time
in construction. The man, a resident of Mancos, had traveled in
several places where he could have come in contact with rodent feces,
Lawaczeck said. State health officials will try to pin down a source
next week, she said.

The last hantavirus death of a Montezuma County resident killed a
woman in 1993, Lawaczeck said. She contracted the disease in San Miguel County.

La Plata County has registered a number of human hantavirus cases,
including 3 deaths, since 1985, Lawaczeck said. One of the deaths
occurred in 1993, the others in 1998.

Hantavirus[es] [cause] a respiratory infection caused by breathing
air contaminated with rodent feces or urine [containing virus],
Lawaczeck said. A typical case would involve someone who was cleaning
a house, cabin or shed that has been closed for a time, Lawaczeck
said. Sweeping could create dust contaminated with [virus carrying]
rodent droppings or urine, she said. "The lungs fill with fluid,"
Lawaczeck said. "The fluid prevents the oxygenation of red blood cells."

[This report does not mention which hantavirus was involved in this
case, but most likely it was Sin Nombre virus.
