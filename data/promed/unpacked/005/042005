[2] "Smoking" peanut butter cracker
Date: Tue 20 Jan 2009

<http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2009-01-19-peanut-butter-problems_N.htm>


The FDA [US Food and Drug Administration] said
Monday [19 Jan 2009] that salmonella was found in
a package of peanut butter sandwich crackers made
by Kellogg. Kellogg said that a previously
recalled peanut butter-sandwich cracker tested
positive for _Salmonella_ as a rapidly growing
national recall widened to include more
companies' peanut snacks because of potential contamination.

Kellogg's Austin Quality Foods Toasty Crackers
with Peanut Butter is the 1st product sold to
consumers that's known to have tested positive
for the strain initially linked only to peanut
butter sold to institutions, such as nursing homes.

The new recalls, including one from General Mills
for Larabar and JamFrakas snack bars, means that
about a dozen companies have pulled products,
including cookies, crackers, and ice cream.
Products were sold in stores such as Wal-Mart and
Food Lion. Wegmans also recalled some ice cream containing peanut butter.

Kroger said Monday [19 Jan 2009] that it is
recalling Private Selection Peanut Butter Passion
Ice Cream sold in select stores because the
peanut butter in the ice cream was supplied by
Peanut Corporation of America and may be
contaminated. Stores under the following names
are included in this recall: City Market, Fred
Meyer, Fry's, King Soopers, QFC, and Smith's.

More recalls are likely, given that the Peanut
Corporation of America, which earlier recalled
the suspect peanut butter and peanut paste,
supplied 23 other companies with product that's
been recalled. PCA [Peanut Corporation of
America] first recalled peanut butter last [Tue
13 Jan 2009] then [Sun 18 Jan 2009] added its
peanut paste, an ingredient used by food
manufacturers. The pace of new recall
announcements has been slow, some food-safety experts say.

"It's taken a long time for people to sort this
out," says Craig Wilson, head of food safety for
Costco Wholesale. It pulled some Kellogg products
off shelves last week [week of 12 Jan 2009]
before Kellogg put a hold on them, Wilson says.

Many big names have said they're not affected,
including Mars, Hershey, the Girl Scouts, and
ConAgra Foods, which recalled peanut butter in 2007.

[3] Expanded PCA recalls
Date: Sun 18 Jan 2009
Source: US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), press release [edited]
<http://www.fda.gov/oc/po/firmrecalls/peanutcorp301_09.html>


Peanut Corporation of America (PCA), is expanding
the recall of peanut butter and voluntarily
recalling peanut paste made at its Blakely,
Georgia facility because the products have the
potential to be contaminated with _Salmonella_.

The recalled peanut butter and peanut paste were
distributed to institutions, food service
industries, and private label food companies in
24 states, the province of Saskatchewan in
Canada, Korea, and Haiti. The USA states are the
following: Arkansas, California, Colorado,
Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,
Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada,
New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North
Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina,
Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Virginia. In
addition, affected product was used as an
ingredient in other products that may have been distributed in other states.

None of the peanut butter being recalled is sold
directly to consumers through retail stores by PCA.

The peanut paste is sold in sizes ranging from
35-pound containers to tanker containers. The lot
numbers for all recalled products are at the end
of this news release. All of the peanut butter
and peanut paste in the expanded recall was made
on or after 1 Jul 2008, and only at the Georgia facility.

The potential for contamination was noted after a
small number of samples from unopened containers
and environmental samples from the Blakely,
Georgia facility tested positive for
_Salmonella_. The Food and Drug Administration
has said the investigation is "very active and
dynamic," and PCA continues to work closely with the FDA and the CDC.

The Blakely, Georgia facility has currently
stopped producing all products as the FDA and CDC
continue their investigation, but some PCA staff
remain to assist in the on-going investigation.

The following is a list of all the products
affected by the original recall and the amended
recall: [due to its length, please consult the

[The distribution of the peanut paste is
certainly wider than that of the peanut butter
and additional affected states can be likely
accounted for by products produced by secondary manufacturers. - Mod.LL]

[5] Canadian recalls
Date: Tue 20 Jan 2009
Source: National Post, CanWest News Service report [edited]
<http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=1197470>


Some peanut-flavored snack foods sold in Canada
could be contaminated with salmonella-tainted
ingredients linked to a growing recall in the
USA, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said in
a health warning. The federal agency said the
snack foods should be put in the trash because
they contain peanut butter or peanut paste
ingredients that were recalled by Peanut
Corporation of America over concerns they could
be tainted with _Salmonella_. No illnesses in
Canada have been linked to the growing salmonella
outbreak in the USA, said the agency in a statement.

Kellogg Canada released a statement Monday [19
Jan 2009] saying that none of the 16 products it
recalled in the USA over concerns had been shipped to Canada.

The health warning in Canada includes the following products:
- Hebert's Fully Loaded P.B. Crunch mini-bars
produced 26 Aug 2008 and 9 Sep 2008.
- Nature's Path Organic Optimum Energy Bar-Peanut
Butter with a 1 Oct 2009 expiry date.
- Clif Bar Chocolate Chip Peanut Crunch with a 7 Sep 2009 expiry date.
