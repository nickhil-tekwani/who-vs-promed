Public health response to a rabid kitten, 2007 -- Four States, 2007
-------------------------------------------------------------------
On 24 Jul 2007 the South Carolina Department of Health and
Environmental Control (SCDHEC) was notified by the North Carolina
Division of Public Health (NCDPH) of a stray, rabid kitten that had
been handled by players on several girls' softball teams during a
tournament in Spartanburg County, South Carolina. This report
summarizes the public health response to exposure to the rabid kitten
and highlights the importance of multistate collaboration in a rabid
animal investigation.
During the period 13 to 15 Jul 2007, the South Atlantic Summer
Showdown softball tournament was held at a recreational complex in
Spartanburg County. Softball games were held at 4 recreational
facilities. Approximately 60 teams of approximately 12 players each
from multiple states participated in this tournament. Spectators at
the tournament included families and friends of the softball players
and tournament coordinators and staff members.
On 14 Jul 2007, a softball coach from a North Carolina team found an
apparently healthy and alert kitten in a barrel-shaped garbage bin
located near one of the playing fields at which the tournament was
held. The kitten was placed in a box and later brought to at least 6
different games played at 2 recreational facilities that same day.
That evening, the kitten was transported by the coach in her private
vehicle to her home in Buncombe County, North Carolina. On 15 Jul
2007, the kitten began behaving abnormally and became increasingly
lethargic. The coach's housemate brought the kitten to an emergency
animal hospital in Buncombe County for care. Although further
investigation would reveal that the housemate had been bitten by the
kitten, she did not disclose this to the attending veterinarian at
the time of the visit. After evaluation indicated that the kitten was
severely ill, the kitten was euthanized and held for cremation,
planned for 18 Jul 2007. Rabies was not suspected by the attending
veterinarian.
On 28 Jul 2007, the mother of a softball player from North Carolina,
after learning from the coach that the kitten had become ill and was
subsequently euthanized, contacted the emergency animal hospital and
asked whether the kitten had been tested for rabies. The mother had
been bitten while trying to feed the kitten during the tournament.
Rabies testing had not been planned by the animal hospital because
the coach's housemate had signed a routine release form indicating
the kitten had not bitten anyone during the preceding 10 days. The
mother went to the clinic, requested the cat's body, and took it in
her private vehicle to her local health department. On 20 Jul 2007,
the local health department sent the body to the North Carolina State
Laboratory for Public Health for rabies testing. On 23 Jul 2007, the
kitten had rabies diagnosed by direct fluorescent antibody testing.
The rabies virus was identified as the eastern United States raccoon
variant by rabies monoclonal antibody typing.
The mother provided her travel history to NCDPH, which then contacted
SCDHEC on 23 Jul 2007 to alert the department about the possible
human rabies exposures in Spartanburg County. NCDPH and SCDHEC
obtained a roster of teams from the tournament organizer and
discovered that Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and
Tennessee all had teams participating in the tournament. NCDPH and
SCDHEC contacted CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)
and state public health authorities in Georgia and Tennessee, and all
4 states subsequently initiated contact investigations; these
investigations sought to identify and locate potentially exposed
persons and ensure that only persons with actual exposures (that is,
contact with saliva, either through a bite, a lick on the oral or
nasal mucosa, or a claw scratch) received post-exposure prophylaxis
(PEP). SCDHEC coordinated the interstate investigation and led its
own intrastate investigation to locate persons, assess exposures, and
prescribe PEP as warranted; in South Carolina, PEP is provided by the
state to exposed persons as determined by SCDHEC.
To locate potentially exposed persons, each state issued advisories
(such as, through daily e-mails) to local health departments;
additionally, South Carolina, Georgia, and North Carolina used local
news media to alert the public and solicit responses from potentially
exposed persons. South Carolina also activated the state's 2-1-1
telephone information system, which uses media channels to advise the
public to call a dedicated state telephone number (2-1-1) for
information related to specific public health emergencies.
The multistate contact investigations and interviews of persons who
had potentially been exposed to the kitten revealed that at least 2
other stray kittens of similar age as the rabid kitten were found in
the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant near the garbage bin where
the rabid kitten was found. These stray kittens, which were possibly
from the same litter as the rabid kitten, were reported by
interviewees to also have been present throughout the length of the
softball tournament; several softball players had handled them. These
kittens were never located by public health authorities. Interviewees
were questioned about their handling of all of the kittens to assess
potential exposure to rabies.
Health department personnel relied on the point-of-contact for each
team, usually the coach, to identify persons who might have been
exposed to the kitten. If players reported exposure, they were
interviewed by health department personnel. Anecdotal evidence
indicated that no tournament spectators had handled the kitten;
investigators were unable to contact spectators because neither
documentation nor recorded entry of persons to any of the
recreational facilities was available.
Of the approximately 60 teams participating in the tournament, 38 had
players and associated family and friends who reported exposure to
the rabid kitten. From these teams, 27 persons were identified as
having exposures that warranted PEP: one from South Carolina, 15 from
Georgia, and 11 from North Carolina; Tennessee reported no exposed
persons. All recipients of PEP had reported actual exposure to a
kitten's saliva, either through a bite, a lick on the oral or nasal
mucosa, or a claw scratch. No reports of human rabies or adverse
reactions to PEP were reported.

MMWR editorial note
-------------------
Animal rabies-control programs, including extensive vaccination
campaigns implemented during the 1940s and 1950s, resulted in a
substantial decline of rabies in domesticated animals in the United
States (1). Domesticated animals accounted for 7.9 percent of all
rabid animals reported in the United States in 2006 (1), compared
with 82.6 percent in 1950 (2).
Despite this decline, stray animals, including cats, continue to pose
a risk for transmission of rabies to humans. During 2006, a total of
49 states and Puerto Rico reported to CDC a total of 6940 cases of
rabies in wild (such as, raccoons, bats, skunks, and foxes) or
domesticated (such as, cats, dogs, and cattle) animals and 3 cases in
humans (1). Of these reported rabid animals, 318 were cats,
representing 4.6 percent of all cases. This represents an 18 percent
increase from 2005, when 269 cases of rabid cats were reported (1).
Of the 24 human rabies cases reported to CDC in the United States
since 2000, none have been associated with exposure to a rabid cat.
The last documented case of human rabies from exposure to a rabid cat
was in 1975 (1). Nevertheless, the risk for human rabies from rabid
cats in the United States should not be discounted.
In addition to the risk for rabies, exposure to rabid cats carries
substantial economic implications for exposed persons, health
insurance companies, and health departments. For example, in
Maryland, during 1983 to 1986, approximately 194 persons received PEP
at a total cost of nearly USD 68 000 because of rabid cat exposures
(3). In New Hampshire, in 1994, approximately 600 persons received
PEP after potential exposure to a single rabid cat, at a cost of
approximately USD 1 million for biologics alone (4). During
1995-2000, cats accounted for 523 (24 percent) of 2216 animal rabies
exposures requiring PEP reported by 4 counties in upstate New York
(5).
Measures to reduce rabies exposures among humans by promotion of
responsible pet ownership and routine vaccination of cats remain
public health priorities. Children should be taught to be cautious in
their interactions with animals, especially those that are
unfamiliar, to avoid potential exposures to rabies and other
infectious diseases (6). First aid for animal bites and scratches
should include thorough washing with soap and water (7). An
apparently healthy dog, cat, or ferret that bites a person should be
confined and observed daily for 10 days (7). If the animal becomes
ill or dies during this observation period, its brain should be
examined by a state laboratory for evidence of rabies virus infection
(1). If rabies is detected, prompt administration of PEP is indicated
(7). If the animal is unavailable for testing, public health
officials should be consulted (7).
The rabid kitten in this investigation was infected with a raccoon
rabies-virus variant. Most rabid domesticated animals are infected
with the terrestrial rabies-virus variant associated with the
geographic location of the animal (8). In the southeastern United
States, the region in which this incident occurred, the raccoon
rabies-virus variant predominates (8). Raccoons have been recognized
as a major reservoir for rabies in the southeastern United States
since the 1950s (1).
This investigation highlights the need for rabies-prevention
measures, such as continued rabies vaccination among domesticated
animals and wild animal populations. The investigation also
demonstrates the importance of interstate collaboration during a
rabies response. Exposed persons were identified through cooperation
among the states and CDC, which included daily conference calls and
e-mail exchanges among investigators in the affected states; CDC
participated in conference calls to provide additional expertise. In
this investigation, rapid, open, interstate collaboration enabled the
expeditious identification and prophylactic treatment of exposed
persons while preventing unnecessary administration of PEP.

[Public education of rabies remains a need, even in developed
countries. The movie industry sensationalizes the furious form of
rabies. This is the form where there is vicious behavior and often
slobbering at the mouth. However, there is a dumb form of rabies
where animals are withdrawn, quiet, subdued. In some animals that are
naturally quite and withdrawn it may be difficult to recognize this
form.
Every public and private school should have film showing the
different forms of rabies and show them to students in every grade
level and enforce the importance of reporting animal bites,
especially from stray animals. It should also be stressed that owning
animals is a responsibility involving rabies shots and health checks.
Despite veterinarians preaching to their clients, there remain scores
of animal owners who do not take seriously the health consequences of
their animals or themselves, in just such a situation as this.
Unfortunately, as we become a less rural society and one that is more
urbanized, there is the tendency to believe that rabies cannot happen
in a city. In reality that is far from the truth. As we encroach on
the habitat of wildlife, they are left with adapting to our urban
ways. Consequently, our risk of exposure to rabies may be increased.
Let us hope such a lesson as this serves as a catalyst to inspire
these communities to host rabies vaccination clinics and to encourage
responsible pet ownership. - Mod.TG]
