A feral kitten found in Spring Township last week has tested positive
for rabies, and one person who was scratched by it has been treated,
according to Pennsylvania Department of Health.

The person treated after being scratched lived in the neighborhood.
No further information was available about that person.

The kitten was acting strangely, prompting someone in the
neighborhood to take it to a veterinarian's office Wednesday or
Thursday, department press secretary Holli E. Senior said. The kitten
was euthanized at the office and tested positive for rabies in a
state lab on Thursday [5 Aug 2010?]. The kitten was part of a litter
of feral kittens that lived in the Chapel Hill Road area, Senior said.

A woman went eye-to-eye with a rabid bat. Now she wants a rabies
vaccine in case she caught the deadly disease. She's even willing to
pay for it herself. But state and county health officials say the
woman's bat encounter doesn't require the rabies treatment, a series
of shots that costs between USD 2000-7000.

Two weeks ago, the alleged victim peered up at a porch railing
looking for the source of a hissing sound that had so intrigued her
dogs. To her surprise, an injured one-eyed bat stared back at her.

She doesn't remember any moisture on her face -- no gob of bat spit
-- but saliva "obviously landed on me, aerosolized."

The woman called a private pest-removal company, which collected the
critter and turned it over to a public health official. A week later,
she learned the bat had been rabid and started to worry. The health
official told her to get her 2 dogs, both Brussels Griffons, to the
vet for rabies boosters in case they had been bitten. The dog's vet
suggested that she get treated, too.

The 51-year-old freelance writer spent 5 hours in Saratoga Hospital's
emergency department where, she said, even the doctor admitted that
he would want the shot. But hospital staff checked with public health
officials, and was told that according to guidelines from the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, she would go home without
the treatment.

Human cases of rabies are rare but almost always fatal. There are
about one or 2 deaths annually in the United States, most often
caused by a bat bite, according to John Whitaker, an ecology
professor at Indiana State University and director of the
University's Center for North American Bat Research and Conservation.

Rabies is transmitted by a rabid animal's saliva getting into a
person's bloodstream. It's possible but unlikely that infected saliva
in the eye could cause rabies, said Whitaker, a mammalogist who has
studied bats for 30 years.

The New York Department of Health's website states: "Although rare,
exposure can also occur if saliva or nervous tissue from a rabid
animal gets into a scratch or other fresh wound (one that has bled
within 24 hours) or mucous membrane (eyes, nose, mouth)." Improving
the woman's odds: Bats don't spit when they hiss.

"The chances of her getting rabies in that way are probably zero,"
Whitaker said. "My suggestion is the doctors should just give her the
shots to make her feel better. ... Hey, she's going to pay the money,
let her do it."

The alleged victim contacted Bryan Cherry, a state public health
veterinarian with the Department of Health, and was told again that
she didn't need the shot. But Cherry said she could get the vaccine
with a doctor's order.

"It's up to a physician on whether they will provide the
post-exposure treatment," said Clair Pospisil, a DOH spokeswoman.
"The health department does not make that decision. We provide
advice, but we don't make medical decisions."

When public health officials determine a person has been exposed to
rabies, the state pays for the treatment. However, the woman must pay
her own way if she wants the shot. Even after talking with the state
vet, the woman said Saratoga Hospital still won't give her the shot.

<http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2010/08/13/officials-seek-court-order-to-kill-lemurs/?>


1st, there was government-sanctioned geese-gassing to cull meddlesome
flocks of fowl in Brooklyn's Prospect Park. Now there could be
court-ordered lemurcide upstate.

It all began when a 7-year-old boy allegedly suffered a lemur bite at
the Ashville Game Farm in Greenwich, N.Y., on 31 Jul 2010. The
culprit is believed to be one of the 3 lemurs kept at the petting
zoo, only no one is sure which, if any, of the small primates is
guilty of the attack. All 3 lemurs have been apprehended by local officials.

The state wants to see the lemurs put to death. "We have the
authority to kill the monkeys," said a state health official, who
asked not to be named. "We don't know which one bit, so they all have to go."

At issue is not vengeance but public health. As the Post-Star
reports, the boy received rabies shots and does not show signs of the
disease so far, but health officials don't want to take any chances.
They want to test the biting lemur itself for rabies. Without knowing
which lemur to blame, all 3 will have to be tested.

But there's a catch: The only way to test an animal for rabies
involves sampling its brain tissue, a procedure that can only be done
on a dead animal. Washington County Attorney Roger Wickes said his
office began court action to seek the tests. He said his office filed
a lawsuit to give game farm owner Jeff Ash a chance to respond to the
request to euthanize the animals.

The state health official told Metropolis that the government already
has the power of life and death over the lemurs and doesn't need to
seek a judge's permission to euthanize the primates. But with legal
proceedings initiated at the county level, a state official is
expected to testify Friday [13 Aug 2010] as an expert witness in the
bid to win the court's backing.

But Jeff Ash, the owner of the petting zoo, is going to challenge the
state's push to kill. In a public statement faxed to Metropolis, Ash
disputes that any of his lemurs came into direct contact with the
7-year-old and questions why the boy's family waited more than a week
to contact local authorities.

"No one actually saw this happen," he says. At the time of the
incident, Ash claims he "observed what looked like to me a small
paper cut" on the boy. The source of the injury might have been the
lemurs' cage, he believes.

In the statement, however, Ash concedes that this is not the only
time he has faced rabies concerns. It's not even the 1st time this
summer. "In another incident a month ago, a girl was pinched by our
pet potbelly pig in the petting zoo area. The skin was not even
broken. They killed to test for rabies, which was tested negative;
the pig did not have rabies [sic].

As a result of this latest brush with government intrusion into his
petting zoo, Ash has resigned himself to close down the operation
entirely. "It hurts me more than I can put into words," he says, "but
I am tired of getting the raw end of the deal."

Ashville Game Farm will close after 7 Sep 2010.

[While this is a long article, both sides of this issue are
important, and the argument for or against the lemurs will not be
rehashed here. Perhaps the owner should be vaccinating these animals
against rabies and be able to provide documentation to that effect. - Mod.TG]

[4] Bat, human - Minnesota

A rabid bat was recently captured in St. Cloud, but whether it has
bitten anyone is unknown, according to the Animal Control Division of
the St. Cloud Health and Inspections Department. The department
announced Thursday [12 Aug 2010] that the bat had tested positive for
rabies and that 2 St. Cloud residents may have been exposed to the
possibly fatal disease.

"Bats are very common to the St. Cloud area. They are native to
Minnesota," said Lisa Schreifels, health director for the city of St.
Cloud. "And attics tend to be a place that -- if they can get in --
can also sometimes be used as a roosting place for them."

The bat was discovered in the shared home during the night and picked
up at the residence by animal control on 6 Aug 2010 for shipment to
the University of Minnesota for testing.

"The folks were not sure if they actually had an exposure to rabies,"
she said of the housemates who awoke to find a live bat. "In this
case, the bat was already deceased when we came to pick it up."

It was recommended to the 2 adults that they be treated for exposure
to rabies, which is a preventable viral disease of mammals most often
transmitted through the bite of a rabid animal.

"Several tests are necessary to diagnose it before death in humans.
Tests are performed on samples of saliva, serum, spinal fluid, skin
biopsies of hair follicles at the nape of the neck," she said of
testing for rabies in humans.

Gone are the days when treatment for rabies included shots to the
stomach. Rather, it is now a 4-shot series in the arm or 5-shot
series if the patient has a compromised immune system.

"We do get several calls a month regarding bats. But the last time a
bat was found to test positive for rabies was in 2001. ... A St.
Cloud resident was bitten by a bat, and that person decided to get
treatment for rabies after that," she said.

The Health and Inspections Department is advising the public to take
special care to avoid contact with bats. People who are bitten or
have contact with infectious material such as bat saliva should
attempt to make sure the bat is collected for testing.

"This is really an active time for bats because it's warm, [with] a
lot of insects, a lot of food available for them; ... but it's
accidental generally when bats go into homes. They certainly don't
want to be stuck in your home, and you certainly don't want them
there," she said.

[There are several different issues in this report, other than the
usual vaccinate your pet to protect yourself issues. It is unusual
that an animal is recommended to get vaccination, but the human is
not advised to get post exposure prophylaxis (PEP).

The difficulties surrounding petting zoos continue to plague this
niche industry. Some reasonable regulations and guidelines are perhaps needed.

Any time bats, especially rabid ones, are found in a dwelling and
exposure is not known, such as with sleeping individuals, then PEP is
needed. Surprisingly, bat bites can often be tiny and not awaken a
sleeping person. - Mod.TG]
