New Mexico: state park employee contracts hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
-----------------------------------------------
Hantaviruses are transmitted through the droppings of deer mice. The victim
of New Mexico's 2nd case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, in 2004, has
been identified as a state park employee who may have contracted the
respiratory illness during the course of his employment. New Mexico State
Parks Director Dave Simon identifies the man as a 54-year-old male, a
13-year veteran of the New Mexico State Parks. The park employee is
believed to have contracted the illness in a maintenance unit at Fenton
Lake State Park, but, Simon says, despite the incident, he believes that
state parks are safe.
The park employee, who lives in Sandoval County, is at the University of
New Mexico Hospital in critical condition. A San Miguel woman contracted a
milder form of hantavirus infection in January 2004. She has recovered.
The state's public health veterinarian, Dr. Paul Ettestad, is warning New
Mexicans to take precautions against the disease. The virus is passed to
humans who breathe in particles of urine or feces from infected rodents,
especially deer mice. Early symptoms are fever and muscle aches, possibly
with chills, headaches, nausea or vomiting, abdominal pain, and coughing.
