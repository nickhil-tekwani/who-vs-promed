Wedding's punch had contaminant
-------------------------
Toxic levels of a common color additive or preservative used in meat and
fish were found in punch served at a weekend wedding in Ankeny at which
dozens became ill, state health department officials said Monday.
The levels of sodium nitrite were found to be "off the charts," said
disease investigator Dr. Tom Boo. The levels caused a rare form of blood
poisoning that sent about 60 guests to emergency rooms Saturday.
"If they would've drank more, and didn't get treated in time, it could've
killed them," Boo said after he reviewed test results from the State
Hygienic Lab in Des Moines.
25 children and 31 adults who attended a wedding reception at Ankeny
Baptist Church were treated for methemoglobinemia, which cuts off the flow
of oxygen in the blood to cause headaches, low blood pressure, dizziness,
vomiting, and shortness of breath.
Neither health department officials nor Ankeny police would name the
caterer hired for the wedding. An attendant of the bride said the punch was
provided by someone other than the food caterer.
All of those treated have been released and are expected to recover with no
long-term health effects, officials said.
It is still unknown how and where the sodium nitrite got into the punch.
Officials think the drink was contaminated accidentally.

Methemoglobinemia epidemics have occured a number of times as a consequence
of confusing sodium nitrate with sodium chloride in the preparation of
homemade sausages or other preserved foods. This occurred recently in
Yonkers, NY with several patients critically ill (Promed
20020525.4319,20020519.4273 May 2002). The amounts of these chemicals
that should be used in food preparation are orders of magnitude different.
If the preservative sodium nitrate is used as salt, it can easily induce
methemoglobinemia in those who ingest the resulting prepared food.
An excellent and highly readable discussion of this topic is Berton
Roueche's 'Eleven Blue Men', which describes a 1944 epidemic of
methemoglobinemia in NYC. Originally published in book form in 1953, it is
currently avaliable (in print) now in his book 'Medical Detectives' (Plume
1991).
