Cameroon: 2 new human T-cell lymphotropic viruses isolated
----------------------------------------------------------
2 new retroviruses never before seen in humans have turned up among people
who regularly hunt monkeys in Cameroon, researchers reported on Fri 25 Feb
2005. Like the AIDS virus, these viruses insert their genetic material
directly into cells and perhaps even into a person's or animal's
chromosomes. Closely related versions of the viruses cause leukemia,
inflammatory, and neurological diseases.
The 2 new viruses are called human T-lymphotropic virus types 3 & 4
(abbreviated as HTLV-3 and HTLV-4). They are closely related to 2 known
viruses called HTLV-1 and HTLV-2, which experts believe were transmitted to
people, like HIV, from monkeys and apes.
"Because HIV originated as a cross-species infection from a non-human
primate virus, the question was how much cross-species retrovirus
infections are occurring, and what are the consequences of these
infections," said Walid Hemeine of the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, who led the study.
They examined blood samples from 930 Cameroonians who had handled or eaten
bush meat (monkeys or apes hunted for food). They used antibody screening
and genetic analysis to find that at least 6 different simian retroviruses
had infected 13 of the people. "2 hunters were infected with 2 previously
unknown HTLV viruses. One person was infected with HTLV-3, which is
genetically similar to a simian virus, STLV-3, and represents the 1st
documented human infection with this virus," the researchers told the 12th
Annual Retrovirus Conference being held in Boston.
"The 2nd hunter was infected with HTLV-4, a virus distinct from all
previously known human or simian T-lymphotropic viruses. It's totally new,
so we don't know any other simian virus that is related to it," Hemeine
said in a telephone interview.
Now the team, which includes researchers at Johns Hopkins University in
Baltimore, plans to look more extensively in Central Africa for the virus,
Hemeine said. "They could be more widespread than we think they are," he
said. Hemeine said up to 25 million people globally are infected with
HTLV-1 and 2. Currently, specialized tests are needed to find the viruses,
he said. "It's a new virus. You pause, you say, where is this virus coming
from. I don't think you should be taking it lightly," Hemeine said. After
infecting one person, simian viruses often spread from person to person
through sex, mother-to-child transmission, and other exchanges of blood and
body fluids. Like HIV, the incubation period for HTLV viruses to cause
disease can last decades, CDC said.

[The viruses originally known as human T-lymphotropic viruses have been
re-designated primate T-lymphotropic viruses in recognition of their
prevalence in non-human primates as well as humans. Human T-lymphotropic
virus 1 and simian T-lymphotropic virus 1 are closely related and now
ranked as members of the same virus species: primate T-lymphotropic virus
1. Likewise, Human T-lymphotropic virus 2 and simian T-lymphotropic 2 virus
are ranked now as members of the same species: primate T-lymphotropic virus
2. Simian T-lymphotropic virus 3 was the sole member of the species,
primate T-lymphotropic virus 3, until its human counterpart was discovered
in Cameroon as described above. Human T-lymphotropic virus 4 is an entirely
new virus, and its simian counterpart has still to be detected. All the
primate T-lymphotropic viruses, together with the species bovine leukemia
virus, make up the genus Deltaretrovirus, one of the 7 genera that comprise
the family of reverse-transcribing viruses know as the Retroviridae.
The deltaretroviruses are transmitted horizontally, and no endogenous
counterparts are known. So far, they have been found only in bovines and
primates. They are associated with B- or T-cell leukemias or lymphomas, and
neurological disease (tropical spastic paraparesis or HTLV-associated
myopathy).
HTLV-1 was isolated 1st from a cell line derived from splenic cells taken
from a patient suffering from a hairy cell leukemia, now considered to be a
fortuitous association. No oncogene-containing members of the genus are
known. HTLV-2 is known now to be endemic among several Amerindian
populations in North, Central and South America. In industrialized
countries, HTLV-2 is prevalent among drug abusers and is spread by
contaminated needles and by heterosexual transmission. In the developing
world, breast-feeding may be the predominant route of transmission.
Biologically, the HTLVs differ from HIV in their greater genetic stability
and their characteristic patterns of geographic distribution.
Previously, it was thought that the present distribution of HTLV 2 in the
world reflected its possible introduction into the New world at the time of
the initial settlement of the American continent by the ancestors of the
present day native Americans some 20 000 to 40 000 years ago, followed by
more recent dissemination from one or a few centers. It seems more likely
now, in the light of the above evidence, that all 4 primate T-lymphotropic
viruses were transmitted to humans from African primates. - Mod.CP]
