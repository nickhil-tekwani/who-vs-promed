The Florida Department Agriculture and Consumer Services has reported 2 new cases of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE).

A 7 year old mustang mare in Polk County used for pleasure riding showed signs of inappetence and lethargy on 19 Jun 2022. She was undervaccinated and euthanized following her 30 Jun 2022 positive test.

Also, a yearling quarter horse filly in Bradford County presented with a fever, depression, ataxia (incoordination), aimless wandering, listlessness, and hind-limb weakness on 22 Jun 2022. She tested positive on 30 Jun 2022 and was euthanized.

These are the 5th and 6th confirmed cases of EEE in Florida in 2022.

On 14 Jul 2022, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services reported a 10 year old miniature horse in St Johns County, Florida, positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE). The gelding, used for pleasure riding, presented with fever, ptyalism (excessive drooling), circling, tremors, and menace on 5 Jul 2022 and was confirmed positive on 13 Jul 2022. He was unvaccinated and has been euthanized.

This case is the 7th horse confirmed with EEE in Florida this year [2022].

Background
----------
Eastern equine encephalomyelitis is caused by the eastern equine encephalitis virus, for which wild birds are a natural reservoir. Mosquitoes that feed on EEE-infected birds can transmit the virus to humans, horses, and other birds. Horses do not develop high enough levels of these viruses in their blood to be contagious to other animals or humans. Because of the high mortality rate in horses and humans, EEE is regarded as one of the most serious mosquitoborne diseases in the United States.

Tips for preventing mosquito-borne diseases include:
• Avoid mosquito bites: Use insect repellent when outdoors, especially from dusk to dawn.
• Look for EPA-labeled products containing active ingredients such as DEET, picaridin (KBR3023), or oil of lemon eucalyptus (p-menthane 3,8-diol).
• Apply more repellent, according to label instructions, if mosquitoes start to bite.
• Mosquito-proof homes: Fix or install window and door screens, and cover or eliminate empty containers with standing water where mosquitoes can lay eggs.
• Protect your horses: Veterinarians recommend commercially available licensed vaccines against EEE for all horses in the U.S. Horses should be vaccinated at least annually (recommendations vary in high-risk areas). It's not too late this year to vaccinate your horses.
• Use approved insect repellents to protect horses.
• If possible, put horses in stables, stalls, or barns during the prime mosquito exposure hours of dusk and dawn.
• Eliminate standing water, drain water troughs, and empty buckets at least weekly.
• Stock water tanks with fish that consume mosquito larvae (contact your local mosquito control for assistance), or use mosquito "dunks" (solid "donuts" of _Bacillus thuringiensis_ israelensis [BTi], which are nontoxic to horses) available at hardware stores.

Local health officials are offering tips on how residents and visitors can protect themselves against mosquitoborne diseases after a horse in Marion County tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE). [This appears to be the last mention of the horse. There is no indication if the horse was not vaccinated or if the horse is alive. - Mod.TG]

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), EEE disease can be spread to people by a bite from an infected mosquito. Only a few cases are typically reported in the United States each year, and most of them occur in eastern or Gulf Coast states. [Many cases appear in horses. - Mod.TG]

While EEE is rare [in human beings - Mod.TG], it is considered very serious. CDC states nearly a third of people who become infected with it die, and many survivors deal with ongoing neurological problems.

The Florida Department of Health in Marion County (DOH-Marion) encourages the community to remain diligent in taking preventative measures like "Drain and Cover" to protect themselves from mosquito-borne illnesses.

Drain standing water to stop mosquitoes from multiplying.
- Drain water from garbage cans, house gutters, buckets, pool covers, coolers, toys, flowerpots, or any other containers where water has collected.
- Discard old tires, drums, bottles, cans, pots and pans, broken appliances, and other items that are not being used.
- Empty and clean birdbaths and pets' water bowls at least once or twice a week.
- Protect boats and vehicles from rain with tarps that do not accumulate water.
- Maintain swimming pools in good condition and keep them appropriately chlorinated. Empty plastic swimming pools when not in use.

Cover skin with clothing or repellent.
- Clothing: Wear shoes, socks, long pants, and long-sleeves. This type of protection may be necessary for people who must work in areas where mosquitoes are present.
- Repellent: Apply mosquito repellent to bare skin and clothing.
- Always use repellents according to the label. Repellents with DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, 2-undecanone, and IR3535 are effective.
- Use mosquito netting to protect children who are younger than 2 months old.

Tips on repellent use:
- Always read label directions carefully for the approved usage before you apply a repellent. Some repellents are not suitable for children.
- Products with concentrations of up to 30% DEET (N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide) are generally recommended. Other US Environmental Protection Agency-approved repellents contain picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, 2-undecanone, or IR3535. These products are generally available at local pharmacies. Look for active ingredients to be listed on the product label.
- Apply insect repellent to exposed skin, or onto clothing, but not under clothing.
- In protecting children, read label instructions to be sure the repellent is age-appropriate. According to CDC, mosquito repellents containing oil of lemon eucalyptus or para-menthane-diol should not be used on children under the age of 3. DEET is not recommended for children younger than 2 months old.
- Avoid applying repellents to the hands of children. Adults should apply repellent first to their own hands and then transfer it to the child's skin and clothing.
- If additional protection is necessary, apply a permethrin repellent directly to your clothing. Again, always follow the manufacturer's directions.

Cover doors and windows with screens to keep mosquitoes out of your house.
- Repair broken screening on windows, doors, porches, and patios.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency offers a search tool for skin-applied repellent products to help individuals determine which repellent is best for them to use.

The Florida Department of Health continues to conduct statewide surveillance for mosquitoborne illnesses, including West Nile virus, eastern equine encephalitis, St Louis encephalitis, malaria, and dengue.

For more information on mosquitoborne illnesses, visit the Florida Department of Health 'Mosquito-Borne and Other Insect-Borne Diseases' webpage [https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/mosquito-borne-diseases/index.html] or contact your local county health department.

Any residents who see dead birds are encouraged to visit the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission 'Surveillance of Wild Bird Die-offs' webpage [http://wildflorida.org/bird/] to report it.

For more information on eastern equine encephalitis disease, visit CDC's 'Eastern Equine Encephalitis' webpage [http://www.cdc.gov/EasternEquineEncephalitis/].

The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services confirmed a yearling thoroughbred colt in Marion County, Florida, was positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) on 21 Jul 2022. He presented with fever, hind-limb paresis (loss of voluntary movement), and recumbency (down and unable to get up) beginning on 8 Jul 2022. The colt was undervaccinated and is now deceased.

This marks Florida's 8th confirmed case of EEE in 2022. [Is this the same horse as reported in [3] above? - Mod.SH]

[Mosquito season is here! Unvaccinated horses are at risk of this disease. It can be deadly. The EEE immunity wanes fairly fast in the horse. Consequently, revaccination is necessary approximately every 3-4 months. Even if you have vaccinated your equine friend, it may be time to do it again to keep the animal fully protected from this disease.

Please check with your veterinarian regarding when you gave vaccination last, or if in doubt, please vaccinate. EEE is preventable with safe, proven vaccines. - Mod.TG
