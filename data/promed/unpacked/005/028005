Farmers are putting pressure on the veterinary experts to find an
explanation for the mysterious condition, hemorrhagic diathesis or
"bleeding calf syndrome", that has been affecting calves for the last 2
years. The condition is still rare, but numbers are increasing.

Klaus Doll from the University of Giessen states that the calves are born
healthy but as soon as they have received colostrum, the composition of
their blood changes and the bone marrow becomes damaged. Very often these
animals bleed to death from minor skin injury or through body orifices.
Hundreds, if not thousands of calves have so far succumbed to the
condition. A large number of cases remain unreported since farmers fear
repercussions as experienced with BSE.

Doll does not believe the condition is infectious. He and colleagues from
Hannover and Munich have applied for grants to carry out research projects.
So far, the Ministry has not responded but pressure from farmers and
scientific ambition are pushing the work forwards.

Experts from the Veterinary college of the Hannover University are looking
into the genetics of the victims while colleagues from Munich are
investigating the syndrome's distribution. Giessen is looking into the
immune system of the cattle. Doll believes that the dams produce antibodies
acting against the immune cells of the calves; however, the trigger for
this process remains unclear.

But some clues are pointing to a rather awkward connection. Doll and
colleagues have observed that the bleeding syndrome has occurred, so far,
only in countries where cows are often given a vaccine against a common
infectious disease, bovine viral diarrhea (BVD). Besides Germany, there are
now cases in Scotland, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Italy. Countries like
Switzerland, Denmark, and Austria, which do not vaccinate against BVD, have
not reported cases so far. Doll will put his suspicion against the vaccine
on trial by investigating 80 animals.

Vaccine producer Pfizer, which began marketing the vaccine 5 years ago,
refrains from definite statements. Pfizer is conducting its own
investigation and, as stated by spokesperson Martin Fensch: "have no
knowledge of any connection of the condition with their vaccine against BVDV."

[The suspicion that a BVD vaccine could be involved in the German cases
should be approached, at present, with caution. According to a recent
report from Scotland, nearly 90 per cent of the reported cases -- up to the
end of August 2009 -- were seen in traditional beef herds. On the other
hand, similar cases, seen in England and Wales, were almost exclusively in
dairy herds (see posting 20090923.3345]. Is the vaccination scheme in dairy
and beef sectors similar?

Among the additional pending questions:
- has the syndrome been reported, in the other affected countries, from
both dairy and beef cattle? Which breeds? Housed or on pasture?
- in Germany, affected calves were, reportedly, febrile; was temperature
elevation seen also in the other territories, so far reported (directly or
indirectly) as similarly affected, namely Scotland, Wales, England, the
Netherlands, Belgium, and Italy?
- have clustered cases been recently reported in other European countries,
or elsewhere? Since when?

In previous postings, several possible etiologies of the syndrome,
infectious or non-infectious, have been listed. It is high time for a
scientifically-based report, written cooperatively by researchers from
several of the affected countries, to be published, including -- at least
-- the detailed clinical and pathological findings. The search for an
etiology could be enhanced once everybody talks about the same issue. - Mod.AS
