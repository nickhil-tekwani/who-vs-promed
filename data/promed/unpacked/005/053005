Recently, we have experienced an alarmingly increasing number of vivax
[_Plasmodium vivax_ malaria in the northern parts of South Korea, which is
close to the DMZ [demilitarized zone. Malaria was thought to be
eradicated in South Korea around early 1980s. Actually, no Korean doctors
[have had experience with indigenous malaria cases after that. In 1993,
one case of vivax malaria was reported among military personnel in the DMZ
area. [The number of vivax malaria cases has been increasing from 22
(1994), 107 (1995), 356 (1996), to more than 1,300 (till September 1997).
All cases were confined to areas close to DMZ including military personnel
and civilians. There is no concrete evidence that malaria had re surged in
North Korea; actually, [there is no evidence one way or the other about
the actual situation in North Korea. Because malaria cases occurred in
areas close to DMZ exclusively, it might be presumably related to North
Korea. There is no evidence of biological warfare intent, either.
However, we have to watch the future trend of increasing tendency of vivax
cases. Some authorities in Korea think that it won't spread to other areas
in South Korea based on the biologic behavior of mosquito. Strong public
health policies including chemoprophylaxis and insecticidal activities have
already been initiated in those areas.
Tourists to DMZ area are safe because malaria mosquito does not bite people
at the daytime, when most tourists are visiting that area.
