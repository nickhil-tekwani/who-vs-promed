[A] Update on atypical pneumonia 30 Mar 2003
The following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the
Hospital Authority:
An additional 60 patients with symptoms of atypical pneumonia were admitted
to public hospitals as of 1 PM 30 Mar 2003. They include 6 healthcare
workers and 36 patients from Amoy Gardens. The remaining 18 were new
patients and contacts of patients with atypical pneumonia.
17 patients, including 12 healthcare workers and medical students of Prince
of Wales Hospital, were discharged from hospital today. A total of 60
patients to date have recovered from atypical pneumonia and been discharged.
Currently, 52 patients are receiving treatment in the intensive care unit.
A 74-year-old female patient with a history of other diseases died in
United Christian Hospital this morning. This brings to 13 the total number
of patients died with atypical pneumonia in public hospitals.
The cumulative figure for patients admitted to public hospitals with
atypical pneumonia is 530, starting from 12 Mar 2003.
The breakdown of figures is as follows: (The numbers in bracket are those
with pneumonia symptoms)
Health care workers of Hospitals/Clinics and medical students 162 (162)
36 of the patients were discharged
Patients, family members & visitors 368 (368)
24 of the patients were discharged
Total admission 530 (530)
60 were discharged
[B] Flight passengers urged to contact DH 30 Mar 2003
The Department of Health (DH) on 30 Mar 2003 called on passengers who had
travelled from Beijing to Hong Kong on flight KA 901(Dragonair) on 26 Mar
2003 to call DH's hotline 2961 8968 for health advice on atypical pneumonia
and surveillance. The hotline will be manned from noon to 5 PM 30 Mar 2003
and from 9 AM to 5 PM on weekdays.
The plea was made as DH's investigation found that a Hong Kong man who had
taken the flight developed symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome
during his stay in Beijing. He was later confirmed to have contracted the
disease. DH has informed the Airport Authority and the airline. Advice was
also given to the airline concerned to disinfect the airplanes. DH is
tracing the crew members and passengers who had taken these 2 flights, for
surveillance purposes.

SARS: New measures at airport to curb importation of new cases; more
patients recovering and discharged - 30 Mar 2003
In yesterday's Press Release, MOH had informed that the fourth imported
case left for Hong Kong on 14 Mar 2003 and then to Beijing on 15 Mar 2003.
On 19 Mar 2003, she became unwell. Between 19-23 Mar 2003, she met and
worked with 2 Singaporean colleagues, who have since returned to Singapore
and are well. She arrived back in Singapore on Southern China Airlines CZ
355 at Terminal 1, Changi Airport on 26 Mar 2003 at 5.38 am. Accompanied by
her mother, she took a taxi from the airport to the Accident & Emergency
Department, Singapore General Hospital. From there, she was transferred by
ambulance and admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital.
Her mother and 2 colleagues have been issued with Home Quarantine Orders.
Others who were served the Orders were 3 SATS officers, 2 SIR officers and
2 relations officers from the airline. We have identified a taxi-driver who
said that he had ferried 2 women from Changi Airport to the Accident &
Emergency Department, Singapore General Hospital on the morning of 26 Mar
2003. As a precautionary measure, a Home Quarantine Order has been issued
to him.
Following yesterday's press statement, we have been able to locate 10 more
passengers. They are all well and quarantine orders are being served to
them. In total, 40 of the 48 passengers (excluding the case) have been
identified. There is a possibility that some of the remaining 8 passengers
are no longer in Singapore. The names of the remaining 8 passengers who we
have still been unable to locate are [see
<http://app.moh.gov.sg/new/new02.asp?id=1&mid=5740> for list of names.]
The latest (fifth) imported case is a 17-year-old Indonesian male student
who left Singapore on 15 Mar 2003 with his parents and his 15-year-old
brother for Guangdong and Hong Kong. The family returned to Singapore on
the night of 23 Mar 2003. On 24 Mar 2003, he was well and attended school
at Bowen Secondary School. On 25 Mar 2003, he developed a fever and was
seen at TTSH as an outpatient. He was given 5 days medical leave. He was
seen again on 27 Mar 2003 and admitted to TTSH as a suspect SARS case. He
stayed at home all this while. He was upgraded as a SARS case on 29 Mar
2003. His mother is also admitted to TTSH as a suspect case. His father and
brother are well.
Additional precautionary measures at Changi Airport to minimize the import
of SARS
To minimize the import of SARS cases, Singapore is stepping up health
screening procedures for passengers arriving at Changi Airport from
affected countries. This is in view of new index cases that are traced to
people who have traveled overseas.
Additional Precautionary Measures For Incoming Passengers
From 5 PM 31 Mar 2003 onwards, for all incoming flights from affected
areas as identified by WHO, nurses will be present to check on passengers
who appear unwell. Those who have fever, will be sent to TTSH for assessment.
Additionally, CAAS has today issued a directive that takes immediate effect
to all airlines operating at Changi Airport requiring them to ask
passengers the 3 questions recommended by the World Health Organisation
(WHO) before allowing them to board the flight to Singapore. The 3
questions are :
1. Do you have high fever of more than 38 degrees Celsius?
2. Do you have one or more respiratory symptoms including cough, shortness
of breath, difficulty breathing?
3. Have you had close contact with a person who has been diagnosed with
SARS or had recent history of travel to areas reporting cases of SARS?
Any visibly unwell passenger will be asked to obtain a doctor's
certification before they are allowed to board the flight to Singapore.
The above measures are on top of the health advisory cards distributed to
all passengers coming from Hong Kong, Hanoi, and Guangdong. MOH and CAAS
will scale up the operations and implement the above measures to other
affected countries as and when WHO updates the list.
Additional Precautionary Measures For Outgoing Passengers
CAAS has issued a directive to airlines in Changi Airport requiring all
airlines to ask departing passengers the 3 questions recommended by the
WHO. This directive takes effect immediately. This is in addition to the
health advisory cards which are distributed to passengers bound for Hong
Kong, Hanoi and Guangdong when checking in for their flights.
SARS Situation Update
As at 30 Mar 2003, the total number of people who have recovered from SARS
and are discharged from hospital is 35. The remaining 53 patients are
hospitalised.
A total of 91 people with SARS have been reported to the Ministry of
Health. Of the 2 additional patients, one is a healthcare worker who is
still traced back to the initial 3 index cases, and the other is the new
(fifth) imported case.
So far, there have been no SARS cases that are linked to the fourth and
fifth imported cases. This brings the total number of family members,
friends or close contacts infected by SARS to 44, and the total number of
hospital staff infected by SARS to 42. These 86 cases are all linked to the
first 3 index cases. The number of infected children still remains at 3.
There are currently 36 suspected cases, 2 out of which are children.
There are 12 patients who are in serious condition, including the fourth
imported case. One patient who was in intensive care passed away on 29 Mar
2003. This patient had concurrent history of hypertension, diabetes, heart
disease and a bacterial pneumonia.

As of 30 Mar 2003, Health Canada has received reports of approximately 98
probable or suspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in
Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta and New Brunswick. There have been 4
deaths in Canada. All Canadian cases have occurred in persons who have
traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household or in a
health-care setting. The information contained in this update is based on
the best available information Health Canada has at this time.
Health Canada is changing the way it is reporting probable and suspect
cases of SARS to ensure consistency in reporting across the country.
"Probable" cases of SARS are similar to suspect cases, but often they have
a more severe illness, with progressive shortness of breath and difficulty
breathing, and in some cases, chest x-rays show signs of atypical pneumonia.
A "suspect" case of SARS is a person who fits into one of the following 2
categories: a person who develops fever and one or more respiratory
symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing,
within 10 days of returning from travel to areas in Asia where SARS cases
are being reported, or a person who develops fever and one or more
respiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath or difficulty
breathing, within 10 days of having had close contact with a "probable"
case of SARS (i.e., within one metre).
The details of the cases to date are as follows:
Ontario is reporting approximately 81 probable and suspect cases. All cases
have occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS
cases in the household or in a health-care setting.
British Columbia is reporting 2 probable and 8 suspect cases.
New Brunswick is reporting one suspect case.
Saskatchewan is reporting one suspect case.
Alberta is reporting 5 suspect cases.
Manitoba is no longer reporting any suspect or probable cases.

[Today's reports reflect an increase in 60 cases in Hong Kong, and 2
additional cases in Singapore. The number of cases reported in Canada has
increased from 37 to 98, but the latter figure is a combination of
suspected and probable cases, whereas the 37 referred to only probable
cases. Information on a global worldwide update was not available as of
the time of preparation of this update.
With the exception of the ongoing outbreak in Hong Kong (and possibly in
mainland China), the outbreak of SARS in other areas seems to be following
a pattern consistent with a requirement of close contact with an actively
ill case of SARS for transmission to occur. One can't help but muse on the
definition of close contact in different environments, and in those areas
with high population density, what might be a casual, non-close contact in
other areas is close enough to allow for transmission in an area with
higher population density. This moderator is reminded of studies conducted
on the baseline incidence of poliomyelitis in India back in the early
80s. It was generally accepted that polio was more of an "urban disease"
with higher incidences observed in urban areas. Results of studies on the
baseline incidence of polio in a highly populated state revealed that the
rural incidence was on a par with the urban incidence. Our interpretation
of this observation was that the standard western definition of urban vs.
rural was based on population density, where rural areas had a markedly
lower population density than urban areas. In the highly populated
districts of India, rural areas had population densities similar to many
western urban areas. Hence, rather than being an urban disease, polio was
more of a high population density disease. Again, food for thought here...
