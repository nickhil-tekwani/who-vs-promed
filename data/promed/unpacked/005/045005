[West Nile fever is a zoonosis (an animal disease affecting humans). Although people are susceptible to the disease, if infected, most show no symptoms.

In its OIE 2013 annual report, Turkey reported West Nile Fever as "infection present (with no clinical disease)." However, in the information found in the WAHID database under the section "Zoonosis," Turkey reported 3 human cases in 2013; see http://tinyurl.com/ljoqgo8 (Note: to view the information, you need to choose the region and scroll down to the name of the country and time period).

According to the information provided by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), as of 28 Aug 2014, 10 human cases of West Nile fever have been reported in the EU. 36 cases have been reported in neighboring countries since the beginning of the 2014 transmission season.
