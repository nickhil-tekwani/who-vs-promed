At least 50 people were victims of food poisoning on [Sun 29 Jul 2018] in Montreuil, Bagnolet, Meaux (Seine-et-Marne), and Courbevoie (Hauts-de-Seine) after eating tuna sandwiches, distributed by a bakery in Bagnolet Seine-Saint-Denis in the region of Ile-de-France.

The patients were observers at polling stations opened by the consulate of Mali for the 1st round of the [Malian] presidential election. Health Relief evacuated several people in a state of relative emergency (light injuries). Some polling stations had to close earlier than planned.

[The etiology of the presumed foodborne illnesses here is not stated but was attributed to tuna sandwiches. Useful information regarding the cluster would be the incubation period from ingestion of the presumed vehicle and the beginning of illness, the symptoms (gastrointestinal or otherwise), and the presence or absence of fever. If tuna salad was the vehicle, which is usually made with mayonnaise, the illness could have been staphylococcal enterotoxin-induced with a short incubation period (less than 4-6 hours), primarily vomiting, and little or no fever. Tuna, even commercially prepared, can be the vehicle for scombroid fish poisoning. Scombroid is caused by histamine produced from histidine in the fish flesh by bacteria. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, an oral burning sensation or peppery taste, hives, itching, red rash, and hypotension. The onset of the symptoms usually occurs within a few minutes after ingestion of the implicated food, and the duration of symptoms ranges from a few hours to 24
