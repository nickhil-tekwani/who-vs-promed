HEPATITIS C - INDIA (02): (JAMMU-KASHMIR) COMMENT

[This comment came in response to the ProMED-mail post "Hepatitis C - India: (JK) RFI 20130128.1518620" on hepatitis C virus infections in Kashmir. In that report, the mode of virus transmission was unclear. The following comment offers an indication of the probable common means of transmission. Mod.TY]

The most frequent reason for hepatitis C virus transmission in resource-poor countries is indeed reuse of needles for injection. During my time in Dakar/Senegal in the 1980s, needles were cooked for 3 minutes before reuse, but colleagues from other countries told me injection needles were simply flushed with water before reuse. Another important source is blood transfusion, again with reuse of equipment and "commercial" blood donors, where one infected donor may infect dozens of blood recipients.

Interferon therapy is not suitable and not licensed for end-stage liver disease. A very important side effect is depression, which may lead to interruption of therapy or even suicide. It requires regular injections which in turn require sterile equipment and possibly a cold chain (freezer for transport and storage). Ribavirin treatment at least requires exclusion of pregnancy and regular control of hemoglobin concentration. Treatment with newer protease inhibitors is far more complex and requires more sophisticated laboratory control.

The most important step might be to identify asymptomatic patients. In these patients, treatment might make sense if resources for treatment are available. These patients should avoid all additional liver damage (above all, alcohol) and be vaccinated against all hepatotropic infections if not already having been infected in the past.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Caspari and colleagues for these helpful comments.

It is clear that prevention and treatment of hepatitis C virus infected individuals is difficult in countries of limited resources, but it is essential to carry out monitoring to detect virus infections early when treatment is more likely to be effective.
