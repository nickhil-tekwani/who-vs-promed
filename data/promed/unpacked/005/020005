Lumpy skin disease in Kurdistan region, Iraq
--------------------------------------------
Case history
------------
Kurdistan region, Iraq reported the 1st case of lumpy skin disease [LSD] when lesions were observed in Barje village near Amedi in the Dohuk [Dahuk] governorate. I am animal health director and as a member of a team of veterinary officers, we visited the affected villages, and after clinical examination, the initial clinical diagnosis was confirmed. [Re time-scale, see comment below].

In October 2013, 9 cases have been seen in Erbil [Arbil] governorate. Clinical signs were: depression, pyrexia, anorexia, emaciation, decreased milk yield, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and excessive salivation. Enlarged lymph nodes and 2-5 cm nodules were developed all over the entire body; all the developmental stages of the lumps have been noted. Pox lesions developed in the mucous membranes of the mouth, nares, and [on the] udder. Few cases showed edema of limbs and the animal was reluctant to move.

Diagnosis
---------
A team from the central veterinary laboratory visited the affected villages and samples were taken from infected animals. Lumps (dermal nodules) were biopsied and blood samples were taken for laboratory examinations. Laboratory confirmation by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed the lumpy skin disease [diagnosis].

Control measures
----------------
General directorate of animal resources and veterinary announced LSD control regulation to veterinary directorate.
Governorate Veterinary directorates were responsible for control procedures; quarantine was imposed in the infected region.
Ring vaccination was employed in a 10 km [6 mi] radius zone around the outbreaks.

Vaccination started, using a sheep and goat pox live attenuated vaccine from both Vetal and Jovac Companies [see commentary]. A 10-fold dose has been used for each cow for immunizing purpose. No adverse reactions have been observed in vaccinated animals and there are no reports of disease in vaccinated animals.

Control of arthropods and disinfection of establishments was done by spraying with insecticide and disinfectant. Movement control inside the region and treatment of affected animals was done.

[ProMED-mail is very grateful to Dr Miqdad Ibrahim Abdullah for the above authoritative, firsthand information on LSD in Iraqi Kurdistan. The region includes the governorates of Dahuk (bordering Turkey), Arbil (bordering Turkey and Iran), and Sulaymaniyah (bordering Iran); see map at http://tinyurl.com/n9w5aw5.

Reportedly, LSD has been identified in 2 of the 3 region's governorates, namely in Dahuk and Arbil. According to complementary information kindly received from Dr Abdullah, the outbreak in Dahuk (in the village Barje, near Amedi, close to the Turkish border; map at http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IZ/08/Amedi.html was suspected in August 2013 and diagnosed by RT-PCR by the central laboratory of the Kurdistan region in October 2103. He further clarified that the disease in Arbil governorate, in October 2013, was from 3 separate "epidemiological units." In the Kurdistan region, many cattle breeders own a small number of animals; they share pastures and each village cattle herd is considered to be an epidemiological unit.

The 2 sheep and goat pox vaccines applied are of Turkish (Vetal) and Jordanian (Jovac) manufacture. Both are, reportedly, used in cattle in Kurdistan in a 10-fold dose (10 sheep doses for each cow). Dr Abdullah added that Kurdistan region veterinary authority planned to vaccinate all animals at risk. He indicated that the vaccination of cattle with the sheep and goat vaccine showed good results: the disease was controlled in Arbil, while measures for control of LSD in the Dahuk governorate are ongoing.

The government of Iraq submitted an immediate notification to the OIE on 27 Nov 2013, reporting 12 LSD outbreaks of which 8 were in Baghdad governorate and 4 in Ninewa governorate. The date of start of the epizootic was given as 26 Aug 2013. Ninewa is situated western to Dahuk, similarly bordering Turkey. To see the locations of LSD outbreaks reported in the eastern Mediterranean, please refer to the OIE map at http://tinyurl.com/mcycwwt (click to center and zoom in). Periods covered can be managed on the website.

In view of the reported LSD spread to southeast Turkey and Kurdistan, enhanced surveillance in northwest Iran seems desirable. The renewed spread of the virus, which is vector-borne, may be expected during the coming spring season. - Mod.AS
