The global status of rabies:
627,000 fatal cases of human rabies were estimated for the period 1976 to
1995. 1,326 were officially reported worldwide in 1991. The true incidence
is greater than 35,000/year.
Africa reported 4,139 cases of animal rabies in 1994 -88% of these dogs,
and 18% ruminants. 141 cases of human rabies were reported in 1994 -136 of
these acquired from dogs.
252 cases were reported from the Americas in 1990; 199 in 1993; 150 in 1994
- 63% from dogs. Over 29,300 rabid animals were reported in 1993; 17,591 in
1994 - 32% of these in dogs.
33,800 cases were reported from Asia in 1994 (not including China and
Pakistan) - 98.3% from dogs. No cases were reported from Oceania that year.
216 human cases were reported by Europe during 1977 to 1995, 61% of these
during 1986 to 1988. 90 cases were reported in 1990; 18 in 1994 (17 of
these from Eastern Europe). Five imported
cases were reported by Europe in 1996. 9,178 rabid animals were reported by
Europe in 1993; 8,908 in 1994 - 66% of these foxes, 9.4% ruminants and 7.9%
dogs.
5.6 million humans are immunized annually following animal bites.
Dogs account for 99% of human cases worldwide, and for 95% of post-exposure
vaccinations. Dog-rabies is reported in 87 countries.
495 rabid bats were identified in Europe during 1977 to 1996 (96% of these
from Netherlands, Denmark and Germany); however, only one case of human
disease (Finland 1985) during this period was ascribed to bats. The
principal carrier of bat lyssavirus in Europe in Eptesicus serotinus.
The principal source in Europe is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes). Immunization
baits have been distributed for this animal in Europe since 1994 (in 14
countries).
Other Lyssaviruses found in mammals (and which may infect man) include
Mokola (in Nigeria, Cameroon, Central African Republic, South Africa and
Zimbabwe); Duvenhage (in South Africa, Guinea and Zimbabwe); European bat
Lyssaviruses (EBL) (in Western Europe); and Pteropid lyssavirus [proposed
name] (in Australia).

Rabies in Bolivia:

The disease is commonly reported from Cochabamba, La Paz, Santa Cruz and
Tarija. The mean rate during the 1970's was 0.5/100,000 per year. A average
of 10 cases per year were reported during 1980 to 1984, and 11.8 per year
during 1985 to 1990. 2,276 rabid dogs were identified in 1988. Eight cases
of human rabies were reported in 1990; 11 in 1991; 25 in 1992; 16 in 1993;
6 in 1994 (5 from dogs; 1 from cat). 526 rabid animals were reported in
1994, including 225 dogs.
