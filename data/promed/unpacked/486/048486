On 24 Jan [2020], the Regional Ministry "officially" declared the existence of _Tomato brown rugose fruit virus_ (ToBRFV) in the Autonomous Community of Andalusia. A total of 6 glasshouses in the province of Almeria have been infected with ToBRFV, not previously known to be present in Spain.

A sample was taken in relation to a possible virus infection in a glasshouse tomato crop and the presence of ToBRFV was suspected. The material was then sent to the National Reference Laboratory for viruses in non-woody species, as this was the 1st possible detection of this harmful organism in our country; its presence was finally confirmed. As a result of an investigation by local agricultural authorities, presence of the virus was subsequently confirmed in 5 other glasshouses related to the one with the 1st detection.

[_Tomato brown rugose fruit virus_ (ToBRFV) was identified as a new member of genus _Tobamovirus_ (type member _Tobacco mosaic virus_, TMV) in Jordan after a new disease of glasshouse tomatoes occurred there in 2015. Since then, it is also being reported from other regions and was shown to affect also capsicum crops. It is spreading in Europe and has recently been added to the EPPO (European Plant Protection Organisation) alert list. ToBRFV symptoms on tomato vary depending on host cultivar, but they may include chlorosis, mottling, mosaic and crinkling (rugosis) on leaves; necrotic spots on petioles and calyces; yellowish mottling, brown spots and rugosis on fruit, making them unmarketable. On capsicum, leaf symptoms are similar, fruits may be deformed with yellow mottling or green stripes.

Almost 100 per cent incidence was reported for some outbreaks in tomato, but not every fruit on an infected plant may show symptoms. The virus was recently found also in coinfection with the potexvirus _Pepino mosaic virus_ (ProMED-mail post 20191029.6751082). It is thought that the observed symptoms on tomatoes may have been due to either virus or to synergism. Further research is needed to clarify a potential role of ToBRFV in coinfections and to whether its presence in coinfections may have led to earlier cases of misdiagnosis and delayed identification of this new virus.

ToBRFV (like many tobamoviruses) is seed transmitted and can also be spread by mechanical means, contaminated equipment, as well as with plant or other materials. It is very stable and can remain infectious for months outside a host. Recently, bumblebees which are used widely as commercial pollinators in glasshouse tomato production, have been shown to be effective vectors of ToBRFV (see link below). Volunteer crop plants and solanaceous weed species are likely pathogen reservoirs. The Tm-22 resistance gene used in some tomato cultivars to protect from other tobamoviruses (such as _Tomato mosaic virus_) does not appear to be effective against ToBRFV. Disease management relies mainly on exclusion but may include phytosanitation (disinfecting tools, removing crop debris) and control of virus reservoirs. Use of certified clean seeds or tomato transplants is crucial.

Tomato seeds are traded widely and are known to pose a risk for spreading viruses and other pathogens internationally (for example, ProMED-mail post 20140122.2222560). Among the seed-borne viruses, tobamoviruses are currently considered a risk for crop production worldwide due to increasing global seed trade. For some species, seed coat surface sterilisation is effective in preventing transmission to new seedlings, suggesting that these viruses are carried on the outside of seeds. However, for some species surface sterilisation of seeds does not seem to prevent transmission, suggesting these viruses may be carried within the endosperm since seed-transmitted tobamoviruses are thought to be absent from embryos.
