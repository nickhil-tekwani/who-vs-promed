Russia: meningitis outbreak in Severouralsk now attributed
to echovirus 6
-----------------------------------------------
Epidemiologists of the Severouralsk Office of the Russian
(Health) Protection Agency (Rospotrebnadzor) have identified
the pathogen responsible for the outbreak of serous
meningitis in the town of Severouralsk (Sverdlovsk region).
Contrary to earlier statements of health officials, it could
not be confirmed that the outbreak was a consequence of a
defective water supply. Testing of potable water supplies
did not detect any pathogen that might have been responsible
for the outbreak of serous meningitis. Analysis of patients'
samples, on the other hand, revealed the presence of an
enterovirus -- human echovirus type 6 -- as the likely cause
of the outbreak, an agent that could propagated by
droplet-transmission.

[This outbreak has been confirmed now as viral meningitis by
detection of human echovirus type 6 in patients' samples. It
is still possible, however, that the source of the outbreak
was contaminated water as originally suspected, with
subsequent propagation of the infection by droplet
transmission. Human echovirus type 6 is now classified as a
member of the _Human enterovirus B_ virus species, together
with the B group of human coxsackieviruses and another 33
echovirus types. Echoviruses types 6, 9, 11, 19, and 30 have
been associated with outbreaks of viral meningitis in the
past. - Mod.CP]
