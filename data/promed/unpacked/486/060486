Chlorine leak in Nanchang
------------------------------------
22 people were severely injured when a liquid chlorine tank in a chemical
plant leaked at 9:30 p.m.on 20 Apr 2004 in Nanchang City, capital of east
China's Jiangxi Province, leaving hundreds of local residents presenting
obvious symptoms of poisoning.
The leaking chlorine tank is a remnant of an oil chemical plant in the
residential area of Nanchang City that stopped production years ago.
Emergency measures were taken immediately, and by 11:50 p.m. the leak was
completely stopped and kept under control.
According to sources with the hospital, all 22 people showing signs of
severe poisoning are out of danger. Searches for poisoned residents are
underway and by Wednesday morning, no more injured were reported.
Causes for the leak of the chlorine tank are still unknown and are being
investigated.
Inhalation of 2.5 milligrams of chlorine gas is enough to cause death, and
symptoms of inhalation include bronchial spasms, dropsy, and respiratory
difficulty.
