[Case confirmations continue to trickle in. The interesting information is that apparently the majority of the new sporadic cases have a history of contact with camels and raw camel products (see WHO update below). With the slight increase in reporting of cases from Riyadh, one hopes that there will not be secondary cases in the healthcare environment.
