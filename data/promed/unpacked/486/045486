Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) outbreaks and surveillance program in

Chronic wasting disease (CWD) has been recognized as an important
prion disease in native North American deer and Rocky Mountain elk.
The disease is a unique member of the transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies (TSEs), which naturally affects only a few species.
CWD had been limited to USA and Canada until 2000.

On 28 Dec 2000, information from the Canadian government showed that
a total of 95 elk had been exported from farms with CWD to Korea.
These consisted of 23 elk in 1994 originating from the so-called
"source farm" in Canada and 72 elk in 1997 which had been held in
pre-export quarantine at the source farm.

Based on export information of CWD-suspected elk from Canada to
Korea, a CWD surveillance program was initiated by the Ministry of
Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) in 2001. All elk imported in 1997 were
traced back; however, elk imported in 1994 were impossible to
identify.

CWD control measures included stamping out of all animals in the
affected farm and thorough cleaning and disinfection of the premises.
In addition, nationwide clinical surveillance of Korean native cervids
and improved measures to ensure reporting of CWD suspect cases were
implemented.

A total of 9 elk were found to be affected. CWD was designated as a
notifiable disease under the Act for Prevention of Livestock Epidemics
in 2002. Additional CWD cases -- 12 elk and 2 elk -- were diagnosed in
2004 and 2005. Since February 2005, when slaughtered elk were found to
be positive, all slaughtered cervids for human consumption at
abattoirs were designated as targets of the CWD surveillance program.

Currently, CWD laboratory testing is only conducted by the National
Reference Laboratory on CWD, which is the Foreign Animal Disease
Division (FADD) of the National Veterinary Research and Quarantine
Service (NVRQS).

In July 2010, one out of 3 elk from Farm 1 slaughtered for human
consumption were confirmed as positive. Consequently, all cervids --
54 elk, 41 Sika deer and 5 Albino deer -- were culled, and one elk was
found to be positive. Epidemiological investigation was conducted by
the Veterinary Epidemiology Division (VED) of NVRQS in collaboration
with provincial veterinary services.

Epidemiologically-related farms were searched for: 3 farms were
found, and all cervids at these farms were culled and subjected to CWD
diagnostic [testing]. Three elk and 5 crossbreeds (Red deer and Sika
deer) were confirmed as positive at farm 2. All cervids at Farm 3 and
Farm 4 -- 15 elk and 47 elk -- were culled and confirmed negative.
Further epidemiological investigation showed that these CWD outbreaks
were linked to the importation of elk from Canada in 1994 based on
circumstantial evidence.

In December 2010, one elk was confirmed positive at Farm 5.
Consequently, all cervids -- 3 elk, 11 Manchurian Sita deer and 20
Sika deer -- were culled, and one Manchurian Sika deer and 7 Sika deer
were found to be positive. This is the 1st report of CWD in these
sub-species of deer.

Epidemiological investigation found that the owner of Farm 2 in the
CWD outbreaks of July 2010 had co-owned Farm 5. In addition, it was
newly revealed that one positive elk was introduced from Farm 6 of
Jinju-si Gyeongsang Namdo. All cervids -- 19 elk, 15 crossbreeds
(species unknown) and 64 Sika deer -- of Farm 6 were culled, but all
were confirmed negative.

[Many of the chronic wasting disease monitoring programs in North
America were not in existence in the early 1990s. Most of the North
American programs require some type of animal identification and often
some corresponding premises identification and accompanying records of
births, deaths and testing of naturally deceased and slaughtered
animals.

It will be interesting to follow the CWD situation in Korea. -
