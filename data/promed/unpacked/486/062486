Summary:

Pandemic H1N1 influenza virus is of global health concern and is
currently the predominant influenza virus subtype circulating in the
southern hemisphere 2010 winter. The virus has changed little since
it emerged in 2009, however, in this report we describe several
genetically distinct changes in the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus.
These variants were 1st detected in Singapore in early 2010 and have
subsequently spread through Australia and New Zealand. At this stage,
these signature changes in the haemagglutinin and neuraminidase
proteins have not resulted in significant antigenic changes which
might make the current vaccine less effective, but such adaptive
mutations should be carefully monitored as the northern hemisphere
approaches its winter influenza season.

Introduction:

Since its emergence in early 2009, the pandemic influenza A(H1N1)
virus has remained closely related to one of the earliest viruses
detected, A/California/7/2009, with little change in the viruses'
genetic makeup in even the most variable genes, haemagglutinin (HA)
and neuraminidase (NA). This lack of drift was reflected in the World
Health Organization's (WHO) Vaccine formulation decisions, which
recommended an A/California/7/2009-like pandemic influenza A(H1N1)
virus for both the southern hemisphere 2010 and the northern
hemisphere 2010-11 influenza vaccines.

While some genetic variants have been reported, such as the D222G
(D239G numbering if starting at the 1st methionine) HA mutation,
which was linked with more severe outcomes following pandemic
influenza virus infection, and a more commonly seen E391K change in
the HA gene during late 2009, no clear variant has predominated in a
country or region, and no vaccine update has been forthcoming. This
report, however, describes the recent emergence in Singapore and
subsequent spread of a genetic variant of the pandemic influenza
A(H1N1) virus to Australia and New Zealand during their 2010 winter
influenza season, where it now predominates and has been detected in
some vaccine breakthroughs and fatal cases.

Methods/Results:

[The authors have sequenced the HA, NA and other genes of 2010
pandemic influenza A(H1N1) viruses from Singapore, Australia, New
Zealand and elsewhere using conventional Sanger sequencing. Viruses
early in 2010 (January to April) from Singapore and Australia showed
the E391K (numbering beginning at the 1st methionine in HA;
equivalent to E374K if starting after the signal peptide sequence in
HA at DTLC). Further sequencing showed that 2 additional mutations
occurred in the NA sequence, M15I and N189S, which were predominant
in viruses from Singapore and Australia by mid-2010.

Readers are referred to the original text of this report for detailed
description of the analysis and the relevant illustrative figures,
data tables, and literature references].

Discussion:

While genetic differences were apparent in this variant group of
pandemic influenza A(H1N1) viruses, when they were assessed for
antigenic variation in haemagglutination inhibition assays (HI) using
ferret antisera raised to A/California/7/2009-like viruses and
viruses from the new variant group (e.g. A/Singapore/548/2010, A/
Brisbane10/2010), no differences in titres were apparent, indicating
that these viruses were not antigenically distinguishable from the
reference and vaccine virus A/California/7/2009.

While the 2009 pandemic has recently been downgraded by the WHO, the
pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus still remains the predominant
influenza virus in most countries, including those in the southern
hemisphere that recently experienced their winter influenza season
(with the exception of South Africa, where influenza B and A(H3N2)
viruses have predominated in 2010).

To date, there has been little change detected in either the genetic
or antigenic characteristics of the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus in
the nearly 18 months that it has infected humans. No clear variant
has appeared apart from minor changes occurring in the HA, NA and
other viral genes during this time. Recently, however, a genetically
distinct variant containing several signature amino acid changes in
both the HA and NA genes has emerged in Singapore, Australia and New
Zealand, coinciding with the winter influenza season in the latter 2
countries.

While the combination of HA mutations at E391K and N142D has been
seen sporadically in isolates in Korea and the United States in
November 2009, the 1st appearance of the double HA and double NA
change has been seen in April 2010 in Singapore
(A/Singapore/CC01/2010). Similar viruses have also been detected in
Guam (A/Guam/2/2010(H1N1)) and Thailand (A/
Bangkok/INS428/2010(H1N1)) in March 2010; they were lacking the NA
mutations but at least partially shared the changes in other segments
(PB2 K660R, NS1 M93I, PB1 T257A and A652V, NP K452R), which makes
these strains closely related to A/Singapore/GP329/2010, which was
isolated in January 2010.

Strains with the full set of characteristic mutations of the new
variant have not yet been reported in other regions and have not
appeared in genetic databases to date.

It remains to be seen whether this variant will continue to
predominate for the rest of the influenza season in Oceania and in
other parts of the southern hemisphere and then spread to the
northern hemisphere or merely die out. Already, this variant virus
has been associated with several vaccine breakthroughs in teenagers
and adults vaccinated in 2010 with monovalent pandemic influenza
vaccine as well as a number of fatal cases from whom the variant
virus was isolated. Unfortunately, we did not have access to the
comprehensive patient records that may have enabled us to determine
the relative frequency of vaccine breakthroughs with this variant
compared to the non-variant. This information is important to
eliminate other confounding factors such as the age of the vaccinee,
time since they were vaccinated or if they were taking
immunosuppressive drugs, all of which might impact on their level of
protection following vaccination. It is, therefore, not known at this
time whether the amino acid changes in this variant virus are
responsible for these vaccine breakthroughs or deaths, or if they are
simply a result of this virus genotype being the predominant virus in
circulation during this period.

The HA and NA amino acid changes seen in the variant are present both
in the original clinical samples and in viruses isolated in MDCK
cells and are retained in viruses isolated directly in embryonated
hens eggs. Careful studies are underway to determine whether the
variant viruses grow better than other influenza
A/California/7/2009-like viruses, but preliminary data indicate that
these variant viruses grow as well or better than viruses without
these characteristic amino acid changes both in MDCK cell culture and
in embryonated hens eggs (data not shown), and this may make them
useful vaccine virus seeds. If confirmed, this may also explain the
rapid spread and predominance of this variant virus. Further animal
and human transmission and growth studies will be required to support
this initial finding.

Conclusions:

A new genetic variant of the pandemic influenza (H1N1) virus has
emerged in Singapore, Australia and New Zealand in the 2nd and 3rd
quarters of 2010 that does not appear at this stage to represent a
significant antigenic change for the virus. However, it may represent
the start of more dramatic antigenic drift of the pandemic influenza
A(H1N1) viruses that may require a vaccine update sooner than might
have been expected with a new human influenza virus.

[At present, there is no clear evidence to associate these mutational
changes -- originating in Singapore and becoming fixed in the
epidemic viruses circulating in Australia and New Zealand -- with any
enhanced virulence or transmissibility. Nonetheless, it appears that
the 2009 pandemic A(H1N1) virus is exhibiting sustained genetic
drift. The biological relevance of these mutations in the HA and NA
genes is unknown, although the authors incline to the view that this
variation may be associated with the occurrence of vaccine
breakthrough. - Mod.CP]
