Forty years ago, on [2 Apr 1979], there was a major leak of deadly anthrax spores from the Soviet biological warfare facility at Military Compound 19 on the edge of Sverdlovsk. The strain of the pathogen, Anthrax 836, was the deadliest.

The filters that kept the anthrax dust from leaking into the environment had to be cleaned with the drying machines turned off. A subsequent investigation found that a technician had removed a filter, leaving a note to that effect. The note was not seen when the machines were later switched back on, and it was several hours before the mistake was spotted. During that time, anthrax dust leaked from the plant and was carried by the wind.

Estimates put the number of people killed at over 100, together with unknown numbers of livestock. They were all downwind of the release. Had the wind been blowing in the opposite direction, most of the city's population could have died.

After the fall of the Soviet Union that the incident was investigated by an international team of inspectors. [Matthew Meselson, Jean Guillemin, Martin Hugh-Jones, Alexis Shelokov, David Walker, & Olga Yampolskaya] Their 1992 findings tallied with a release of anthrax downwind from the site.

[It was an interesting trip in many regards, not least of which was that we were there more because of internal Russian politics than their desire that we discover what had really happened back in 1979. And it was because of the honesty of our Russian scientist colleagues and city public health officers that we were able to work it out. David Walker, our pathologist, got well embedded with the pathologists who had autopsied 42 cases, and published the first paper: Abramova FA, Grinberg LM, Yampolskaya OV and Walker DH. Pathology of inhalational anthrax in 42 cases from the Sverdlovsk outbreak of 1979. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1993; 90: 2291-2294, https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/90/6/2291.full.pdf. This neutralised the Russian efforts to present it as a gastro-enteric epidemic. This was followed by the rest of the team's analysis of the 1979 events: Meselson, M., J. Guillemin, M. Hugh-Jones, A. Langmuir, I. Popova, A. Shelokov, and O. Yampolskaya.1994 The Sverdlovsk anthrax outbreak of 1979. Science, 266:1202-1208, http://science.sciencemag.org/content/266/5188/1202.long.

And this unlocked the many genomic analyses of _Bacillus anthracis_ initially headed up by Paul Jackson & Paul Keim. Relevant to the Sverdlovsk events was this paper: Jackson PJ, Hugh-Jones ME, Adair DM, Green G, Hill KK, Kuske CR, Grinberg LM, Abramova FA and Keim P. PCR analysis of tissue samples from the 1979 Sverdlovsk anthrax victims: The presence of multiple _Bacillus anthracis_ strains in different victims. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998;95(3):1224-9,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/95/3/1224.full.pdf. And an interesting later study on incubation periods: Brookmeyer R, Blades N, Hugh-Jones M and Henderson DA.. The statistical analysis of truncated data: application to the Sverdlovsk anthrax outbreak, Biostatistics, 2001(2): 233-247, https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/2/2/233/278582.

An interesting time and the government institute in Ekateriburg continues with its research. - Mod.MHJ
