Regarding the comment: "It would still be interesting to have a
comment from the authorities as to why construction sites are
repeatedly singled out as the source, and why the high transmission in
slum areas is not discussed;"

Historically, construction sites have been regarded and documented as
prime locations for _An. stephensi_ (the primary urban/peridomestic
vector in India and South Asia).

Construction sites, in general, are notorious for having excessive
standing water (ground pools, seepages) and numerous artificial
containers, all of which can be utilized as larval habitats by this
species. One could view _An. stephensi_ as the anopheline equivalent
to _Aedes aegypti_ in this respect. A number of published accounts
exist, just 2 examples herein:

Kumar A, Sharma VP, Thavaselvam D. 1991. Malaria related to
constructions in Panaji, Goa. Ind J Malariol. 28: 219-225.

Kumar A, Thavaselvam D. 1992. Breeding habitats and their
contribution to _Anopheles stephensi_ in Panaji. Ind J Malariol.
29:83-88.

Slum areas undoubtedly present similar circumstances for having
abundant potential larval habitats, given the generally poor
sanitation and a preponderance of artificial containers (tins, plastic
packages, etc.), some serving as water storage (tanks, cisterns).
Together with overcrowding, slums appear ideal for transmission of
particular mosquito-borne diseases.
