In the city of Turkestan in the South Kazakhstan region, a 36-year-old
pediatrician has died from Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF)
virus infection. She worked in a maternity hospital in the city of
Turkestan. She was admitted on 10 Jul 2009 to the Central City
Hospital with a diagnosis of acute respiratory viral infection. Later,
CCHF virus infection was confirmed. On the night of 13 Jul 2009, the
patient died. Previously, she had been attending the birth of a child.

The Office of the Public Prosecutor has established that on 24 Jun
2009, a 23-year-old woman was admitted, who the same day gave birth to
a child in the obstetric department of the maternity hospital in
Turkestan. After 3 days, she was discharged with the child under
supervision of her local doctor.

On 29 Jul 2009, this woman was re-admitted to the maternity hospital
with symptoms of hemorrhage. Due to these symptoms, she was operated
on by a team of doctors. During the operation, there was severe
bleeding. On 2 Jul 2009, as a result of complications subsequent to
the operation, she underwent surgery again. On the same day, another
operation had to be carried out, but the newborn child died on 3 Jul
2009, and the mother died on 4 Jul 2009. Subsequently on 9 Jul 2009, a
vascular surgeon who had operated on the patient died after returning
to his practice in the city of Shymkent.

On 10 Jul 2009, the head of the surgical branch of City Hospital, who
headed the team operating on the woman, was admitted to the infectious
department of the central City Hospital of Turkestan. He was ill on
7-8 Jul 2009. Preliminary diagnosis of CCHF was established on the
basis of clinical and epidemiological data. On 11 Jul 2009, in spite
of treatment, the chief surgeon died.

On 10 Jul 2009, a 25-year-old assistant gynecologist in the maternity
hospital of Turkestan who repeatedly examined the woman in child-birth
arrived in the infectious department with a diagnosis of "acute
respiratory viral infection of moderate severity." On 11 Jul 2009, a
34-year-old junior maternity nurse was admitted to the infectious
department with a preliminary diagnosis of "acute respiratory viral
infection of moderate severity." She had looked after the woman in
child-birth in the maternity hospital.

After the intervention of the Office of the Public Prosecutor remedial
measures have been put in place. A working group has been established
to monitor progress.

[This tragic incident involving the deaths of at least 3 medical
personnel is illustrative of the potential for CCHF virus infection to
spread in a healthcare environment by nosocomial transmission.
