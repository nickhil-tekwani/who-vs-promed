The Regional Ministerial Secretariat of Health reported 2 new cases of
people infected by [a] hantavirus in the Araucania region, and the
[region's] 1st death this year [2010] as reported by the Public Health
Institute (ISP). Both cases are people who reside in the region, but just
one was infected in Araucania.

The fatal case is a 46 year old man who resided in the rural area of the
Puren commune, who died in Concepcion on 14 Apr [2010], [with] a suspected
virus [infection], a situation that is now confirmed [as a hantavirus
infection]. According to epidemiological investigations by the team from
the Health SEREMI [Regional Ministerial Secretariat], the man, whose work
consisted mainly of cleaning storage areas, might have been infected in a
rural area of the Los Sauces or Puren communes, where he was working most
recently.

The 2nd case [not fatal] relates to a 53 year old man, a Temuco resident,
who after the earthquake traveled to the rural area of the Cabrero commune,
according to a report in the Temuco El Austral newspaper.

The Health SEREMI [official], Dr Gloria Rodriguez, called on the population
to take extreme preventive measures in confronting the virus.

[In his 15 Feb 2010 report (ProMED-mail archive no. 20100215.0534), Dr
Julio Garcia Moreno indicated that up to that date this year (2010), 10 new
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome cases had presented in Chile, confirmed by
the Institute of Public Health of Chile (National Reference Laboratory). Of
these, 4 died (case fatality rate so far of 40 per cent). Of these total
cases, 3 were in the Araucania Region (IX), but apparently were not fatal,
since the report above indicates that the region has just had its 1st
fatality. The hantavirus involved in these cases is most likely to be Andes
virus.

the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at
