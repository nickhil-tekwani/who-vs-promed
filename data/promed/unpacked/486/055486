A new yellowing disease in _Phaseolus vulgaris_ associated with a
whitefly-transmitted virus. E Segundo, G Martin, IM Cuadrado, D Janssen
<dirkjanssen@telefonica.net>, Unidad de Virologia, IFAPA, Autovia del
Mediterraneo s/n, 04745 La Mojonera, Spain. Accepted for publication 19 Mar
2004.
In the autumn of 2003, a new disease was observed in French bean
(_Phaseolus vulgaris_) grown commercially in Spain. Symptoms resembling
nutritional disorders consisted of interveinal mottling and yellowing in
leaves, combined with stiffness or brittleness, were produced on the middle
to lower parts of affected plants. Similar plants infested with whiteflies
(_Bemisia tabaci_, [Bt]) were observed in greenhouses. Reproducible
symptoms were observed when the virus was transmitted from bean to bean by
Bt (9/10) but not by mechanical inoculation (0/30).
Electrophoresis of double-stranded (ds) RNA extractions from
field-collected samples and Bt-inoculated plants revealed a
high-molecular-weight dsRNA doublet, consistent with the bipartite genome
of criniviruses (Celix et al, 1996). cDNA transcripts were produced and
amplified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from
the agarose-purified dsRNA species by Uneven PCR (Chen and Wu, 1997).
Individual amplicons were cloned into pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega, WI,
USA), sequenced and then analyzed using Blastx (NCBI, Bethesda, USA).
The nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence from one amplicon
(GenBank accession AY543165) showed the highest percentage identity with
the heat shock protein 70 homologue from members of the genus Crinivirus
such as Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus (CYSDV) (respectively 57
per cent and 67 per cent), Beet pseudo-yellows virus (BPYV) (respectively
54 per cent and 63 per cent) and Tomato chlorosis virus (ToCV)
(respectively 52 per cent and 57 per cent).
RT-PCR analysis with designed specific primers (forward primer 5
'-TTATGTATGATCTAGGCGGAGGTC-3' and reverse primer 5
'-CTGGGTCAATGATACAAGTTAGTC-3') produced amplicon of the expected size (465
bp), when using total RNA extracts from diseased plants and viruliferous
whiteflies.
This is the first report of a yellowing disorder in bean associated with a
Bt-transmitted plant virus, with molecular and epidemiological features
consistent with criniviruses (Wisler et al, 1998). Based on the host range
and the unique partial genome sequence, we suggest the name bean yellow
disorder virus (BnYDV) to describe this new virus.

[This report is of interest to plant virologists and is a good example of
virus evolution. A host range test should be done to determine whether
other food legumes monitored by ProMED-Plant (pea, chickpea, cowpea,
lentil, peanut/groundnut and soybean) are susceptible to this virus. - Mod.DH]
