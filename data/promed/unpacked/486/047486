Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: Novel swine enteric coronavirus disease(s) (SECoV) is a disease in swine caused by emerging porcine coronaviruses, including porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) and porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV). SECoV affects swine causing diarrhea, vomiting, and 50-100 percent mortality of infected piglets. The clinical presentation of SECoV infections in growing pigs can be variable in its severity and not readily distinguishable from many other causes of diarrhea in growing pigs. While adult pigs can become infected, mortality is low. SECoV is clinically indistinguishable from transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), another swine disease caused by a coronavirus that is endemic in the United States.
Chronological occurrence of the SECoV event:
- May 2013: USDA APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL), in close collaboration with Iowa State University-Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (ISU-VDL) confirmed the presence of PEDv in the United States. * Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (ISU-VDL) managed case reporting of PEDv through the American Association of Swine Veterinarian (AASV) website, https://www.aasv.org/. o Retrospective testing identified PEDv-positive cases from April 2013.
- June 2013: the USDA National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) began management of SECoV case reporting.
- November 2013: the United States provided the OIE with information related to the PEDv situation affecting swine herds.
- March 2014: confirmation of the presence of porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV); NAHLN began management of PDCoV case reporting.
- 2013-2014 (ongoing): USDA APHIS Collaborative Efforts with Stakeholders: * development of a PEDv case definition and testing protocols; * sequenced the PED virus and deposited the information in GenBank; * banked paired specimens for use in future diagnostic test development; * diagnostic test evaluations and pathway assessments in progress; * completed and ongoing epidemiological studies; * development of a 'Monitoring and Management Program for Novel Swine Enteric Coronavirus Diseases'
- As of 16 Apr 2014: since its confirmation in the United States, SECoV PCR-positive laboratory accessions have been reported from 29 States. These data only include voluntarily submitted biological samples. They do not include testing conducted at private laboratories, at the NVSL, or for research purposes.

Control measures
Measures applied: no vaccination; treatment of affected animals (supportive care)
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is not a new virus to the world. It has occurred and continues to occur in many countries. The disease has not been a trade-restricting disease, but it does affect production. The virus is not known to pose any risk to other animals or humans or to food safety.

The following information was obtained from the American Association Swine veterinarians (AASV), Fact Sheet on Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus (PEDV) http://www.aasv.org/pedv/AASVPEDQF.pdf:
"Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a viral disease caused by a member of the family _Coronaviridae_. Although clinically similar to transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), the virus is unrelated to TGE. Prior vaccination for TGE (or, presumably, prior exposure to TGE or respiratory coronavirus) does not infer protection against PEDV. Introduction of PED virus into a naive herd typically results in acute outbreaks of severe diarrhea, vomiting, high morbidity (often 100 percent) and variable mortality (as high as 100 percent in young pigs). The incubation period is short (2-4 days) and natural immunity develops over 2 to 3 weeks, resulting in colostral protection for neonatal piglets. The virus spreads via the fecal-oral route and fomites.

The virus is diagnosed based on clinical signs, history, ELISA or electron microscopic examination of fecal material, PCR, and post-mortem examination of dead pigs. Differentiation from TGE requires laboratory diagnosis. Treatment is supportive to maintain hydration. The virus is susceptible to a number of common disinfectants. Sanitizing and drying pig trailers are effective against PEDV.

The disease occurs in Europe (first identified in 1971 in Great Britain) and became endemic in Asia in 1982. In 2010, a variant strain was identified on pig farms in China resulting in decreased efficacy of the PED vaccines routinely used in Chinese sow herds and severe disease (high morbidity and mortality). The virus currently circulating in the US swine herd is 99.4 percent homologous with a strain known to be circulating in China in 2012.

Research has identified transportation and points of swine concentration (markets, buying stations, etc.) to be key sites of virus contamination and subsequent routes of exposure to naive populations. Strict adherence to biosecurity measures designed to prevent exposure to contaminated fomites may help reduce the risk of disease transmission."

Current information on the PEDv situation in the United States can be found in the American Association of Swine Veterinarians' website at http://www.aasv.org/aasv%20website/Resources/Diseases/PorcineEpidemicDiarrhea.php as well as in the America's Pork Checkoff website at http://www.pork.org/News/4045/PEDVUpdate.aspx. - Mod.CRD
