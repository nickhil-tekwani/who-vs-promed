The outbreak of deadly African horse sickness [AHS] in the Eastern
Cape has now reached Port Elizabeth, with 2 horses dying from the
disease near Lovemore Park this week.

Since January 2008, more than 180 cases have been reported in the
Eastern Cape, and at least 130 horses have died from the disease,
which affects the animals' breathing and causes severe temperatures
and then death.

Two weeks ago, the Southern Cape announced that Eastern Cape horse
owners who wanted to move their animals into the Western Cape for
export and sale would have to 1st send them to holding facilities in
Beaufort West and George for 3 weeks to contain the outbreak.

Veterinarian Dr Charles Hayward said yesterday [20 Mar 2008] that
test results from one of the horses, which had been put down on
Monday [17 Mar 2008] morning, had come back as AHS positive.

"We are urging all owners not to move their horses, as moving them to
places where AHS is present, such as Uitenhage, Bathurst or
Grahamstown, places them at risk."

Hayward said he was also concerned that the virus was becoming more
virulent. "The horse that was put down had been vaccinated against
the disease, which is a big concern" [See item 2. - Mod.AS].

He said the vaccine did not cover all the strains of African horse
sickness, and, although testing and developing was underway to
improve the vaccine, this "doesn't happen overnight."

The Eastern Cape's western district manager for veterinary services,
Dr Jane Pistorius, said the outbreak appeared to be predominately in
the western region of the Eastern Cape, which included Nelson Mandela
Bay and surrounding areas such as Grahamstown, Bathurst,
Graaff-Reinet and Uitenhage.

Pistorius said she suspected that zebras, which are carriers of the
disease, were one of the main causes of the latest epidemic.

She said the outbreak occurred every year in hot and fairly wet
weather, which the midges thrived on. She noted that the midge
population was increasing, which allowed the disease to spread to
previously unaffected areas. She also said a number of horse shows
had been postponed or cancelled because of the outbreak.

"Any horse gathering would obviously cause an increase in risk of the
spread of disease."

Despite the outbreak, the only area that was enforcing the quarantine
of horses was around Cape Town. "Although we advise against the
transporting of horses, we don't forbid it unless of course the farm
is obviously under quarantine."

Fewer than half of the 300 000 horses in South Africa have been
vaccinated against African horse sickness.

We've had a wet season country-wide and many vector-borne diseases to
cope with.

In the E. Cape, we have AHSV 6, 7 and 9 but predominantly type 7.
AHSV 6 and 7 are contained in bottle 2 ["combination II"; see
commentary further. - Mod.AS] of the vaccine, but type 9 was never
included because it was a North and West African type which only
reached South Africa in 1993. AHSV 6 gives a heterologous protection to type 9.

What is interesting about the E. Cape is that it has had type 2
continuously every year since 2003, possibly overwintering in the
Province? So far this year (2008), no type 2 yet.
