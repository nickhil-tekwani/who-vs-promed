Biosecurity New Zealand (Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, MAF)
announced this afternoon [20 Nov 2010] that samples of New Zealand
pollen have tested positive for the bacterial kiwifruit disease,
_Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_ (Psa). Positive results from
2009 and 2010 and "weak" positive results from 2007 indicate that Psa
may have been present in New Zealand for a number of years. The
samples pre-date imported pollen.

Imported Chilean pollen produced a "weak" positive result on a single
sample. The implications of this result are still unclear; however,
testing of historical samples suggests that this pollen may not be
the original source of infection.

There is no current evidence to show that Psa in pollen can infect
healthy kiwifruit vines. MAF's initial analysis shows that many
infected orchards have not used artificial pollination, suggesting
other mechanisms of spread. [However,] MAF cautioned growers on the
use of artificial pollination. Pollen collected in the same orchard
presents a lower risk than pollen sourced from another property.

The number of diseased kiwi plantations amount to 51 and increased from 37.

Representatives of the kiwi industry have now decided to fight the
bacteria aggressively using AUD 25 million [USD 24.9 million] in
government funding. Money will further be invested in research on PSA
and other plant diseases.

In future, MAF experts warn farmers to test pollen that they wish to
use for their plantations for PSA before pollinating.

The kiwifruit bacteria PSA has been found in the South Island [SI],
and eradication is looking increasingly unlikely, Biosecurity
Minister David Carter says. "MAF and industry is accepting that
eradication is looking very, very difficult," he said.

The bacteria have [now also] been found outside the 23 km area of
infection south of Te Puke, including 2 orchards in Hawke's Bay, one
in Motueka [SI], and one in Golden Bay [SI]. More infected orchards
are likely to be found, according to the MAF response manager, David
Yard: Over 12 000 samples have been submitted to a testing
laboratory. He says the 4 new cases outside Te Puke show "an evolving
picture of a wider distribution."

It is not known how the disease arrived in New Zealand. The kiwifruit
industry was until 12 days ago disease-free. Growers have never
insured against disease because there has been no need to. There are
3077 registered kiwifruit orchards in New Zealand.

MAF Biosecurity has announced burning of infected kiwifruit vines is
due to start at a special incineration zone. MAF Psa infection
response manager David Yard says a never before used incineration
machine will burn the infected vines. The air curtain incinerator was
originally purchased by the department for the disposal of animal
carcasses if there was an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in
New Zealand.

[Bacterial canker of kiwifruit (_Actinidia_ species and hybrids)
caused by _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_ was originally
described in Japan in 1989, but its area of origin is uncertain.
Symptoms include discolouration of buds and vascular tissues, leaf
spots, wilting, stem and twig cankers with characteristic red
exudate, fruit collapse, and eventually death of the plant. The
disease is favoured by cool temperatures and high humidity, thus
symptoms are usually seen in spring and autumn.

Data on epidemiology are still lacking, but infection is thought to
occur via natural leaf openings and wounds. The pathogen is suspected
to be spread by heavy rain, strong winds, mechanical means (including
animal and human activities), and infected planting material. Spread
with infected fruit and/or pollen cannot be excluded until conclusive
data become available.

Generally, disease management of bacterial diseases may include
cultural practices, crop rotation, phytosanitation to prevent spread,
use of clean planting material and resistant crop varieties, but
specific control strategies for kiwi canker are being developed.
Chemical control (copper compounds, antibiotics) is used in Japan,
but resistant pathogen strains have emerged.

It is thought that a recent outbreak in Italy (ProMED-mail post
20100414.1207) affecting 25 percent of the Zespri Gold variety vines
may have been due to the emergence of a new strain. The strains
present in New Zealand still remain to be identified.
