First Case of Dengue Fever Confirmed on Island of Hawaii
--------------------------------------------------------
HONOLULU (From the Hawaii Health Department's Web site on dengue fever):
The number of confirmed dengue fever cases in Hawaii has reached 74, as the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first case of the
mosquito-borne illness on the island of Hawaii.
Fifty-six cases have been on Maui, where the first locally transmitted
cases of dengue began showing up in early September. One new case has been
confirmed in Maui since last week, state health officials said on Thu 1 Nov
2001. Along with the confirmed cases, more than 300 reports of illness
remain under investigation across the state.
Dengue virus -- which causes fever, headache and rashes on the palms and
feet -- is believed to have entered Hawaii on people traveling from Tahiti
or American Samoa, where the disease is epidemic.
Before the current outbreak, Hawaii had not had a locally transmitted case
of dengue fever since World War II. The state Health Department has
embarked on a statewide mosquito control program to try to stem the outbreak.
