[English summary by Mod.JW]

A 15-year-old boy died of hemorrhagic fever on Sun 3 Dec 2000 in a hospital
in Gitega, near Kigali, the capital. He became sick in Ruhengeri district,
which is in the north of the country (towards the Uganda border).
Authorities suspect Ebola fever, and have placed his contacts under
surveillance.
The symptoms were confirmed by Sebastien Roy of Medecins sans Frontieres
(MSF) in Kigali, who said specimens had been sent to Johannesburg, South
Africa, for diagnosis.

[The symptoms could equally have been due to Marburg or Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever or even another of the many African viruses that cause
such fevers. The recent outbreaks of Marburg and Ebola hemorrhagic fevers
in Uganda appear to have raised the level of awareness about these fevers
in neighboring countries, which will be a good thing if it leads to
increased precautions in handling patients. It looks as though our
colleague Bob Swanepoel, at the National Institute for Virology in South
Africa, is having his work cut out running diagnostic tests on all these
cases. - Mod.JW]
