Increased efforts are needed to improve awareness among rural communities in West Africa about the risks of contracting the ebolavirus from eating certain wildlife species including fruit bats, FAO [the UN Food & Agriculture Organization] warned today [21 Jul 2014].

Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone are struggling to contain the world's deadliest recorded outbreak of the virus, which is transmitted by direct contact with the blood and body fluids of infected people and infected animals. The West African epidemic is thought to have started when the virus crossed over from infected wildlife into the human population and then began spreading between people. Curbing human-to-human transmission is the most important focus for governments and international health agencies.

However, FAO is working closely with the World Health Organization (WHO) to raise awareness of the transmission risks from wildlife among rural communities that hunt for bushmeat -- meat obtained from forest animals -- to supplement their diets and income. These communities risk future spill-over from species that can carry the virus, including fruit bats, some primates, and duikers [small antelopes; see museum specimens: http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/wp-content/blogs.dir/471/files/2012/04/i-3504381b24d2daec1079f571536ea923-jane_tringzoomusduikers.jpg. - Mod.JW].

"We are not suggesting that people stop hunting altogether, which isn't realistic," said FAO chief veterinary officer Juan Lubroth. "But communities need clear advice on the need not to touch dead animals or to sell or eat the meat of any animal that they find already dead. They should also avoid hunting animals that are sick or behaving strangely, as this is another red flag."

Fruit bats -- usually eaten dried or in a spicy soup -- are thought to be the most likely reservoir species for the virus, which they can carry without developing clinical signs of the disease, and should be avoided altogether, according to FAO. "The virus is killed when meat is cooked at a high temperature or heavily smoked, but anyone who handles, skins or butchers an infected wild animal is at risk of contracting the virus," Lubroth said.

While several governments in the region have attempted to outlaw the sale and consumption of bushmeat, bans have proved impossible to enforce and have met with suspicion from rural communities. "There is a lot of mistrust, to the extent that people are hiding patients rather than getting medical help, and it's very difficult to control the disease in the midst of many myths and rumours," said Katinka de Balogh, FAO veterinary public health officer and Ebola virus disease focal point.

De Balogh said there were growing concerns about the effect the outbreak may have on food security in some parts of the region, as some farmers are too afraid to work in their fields, while some markets have also closed down.

FAO has already committed resources and is working with governments, WHO country offices and other partners in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone to improve information about the virus at community level, using existing networks such as rural radio and agricultural extension services. "It is critical for rural communities to understand the risks, both of human-to-human transmission and from wildlife so that they are in a position to make informed decisions themselves," de Balogh said. The organization will work with governments to also set up wildlife surveillance systems to support early detection of the virus, collaborating with wildlife rangers, veterinarians, and local universities. "Rural communities have an important role to play in reporting unusual mortality in the animal population, which is another reason that their collaboration is so crucial," de Balogh said. In addition, FAO will help to assess the role of hunting in livelihoods with a view to finding healthier and more sustainable long-term livestock production alternatives to provide people with additional protein and income.

[2] Sierra Leone: hospital fracas
Date: 21 Jul 2014

Events on the night of Fri 18 Jul 2014 saw the escape from isolated observation of a pregnant woman (surname and address withheld) from the Princess Christian Maternity Hospital (PCMH) along Fourah Bay Road. According to medical staff who asked not to be named, from her presenting symptoms, she was presumed to be a suspected case of Ebola virus disease [EVD]. Blood samples were taken from her and sent to Kenema for testing. While the medical team awaited confirmation she was advised to be kept under observation in isolation from other pregnant patients.

On Friday [18 Jul 2014] evening, [her] relatives came with a huge group of well-muscled young men said to have been recruited from places near her residence in Eastern Freetown's Kissy suburbs. The youths and a loud bunch of women manhandled the security personnel at the gates, marched to the isolation room and forcibly helped her to escape from the hospital. The nurses on duty were threatened and overpowered by the group from Kissy in the east end of Freetown. One of the nurses on duty was slapped and further threatened for attempting to stop the escape. The patient was then put on a motorbike which sped off with her under the pouring rain. This newspaper's correspondent was right at the scene as she was being driven off on an okada [motorbike taxi] under a heavy rainfall.

"If this lady is found to be positive when the test results are out, it is obvious that the okada rider who drove off with her under the pouring rain, other close relatives, and friends who touched her stand the risk of being infected," a resident of Fourah Bay Road said.

"With all the reports about Ebola, if these people still do not believe this is a security threat to all of us, they will not come back to the hospital even if they get infected. They are the ones who will hide and continue spreading the disease until the situation gets worse. It is only when they start dying that they will believe. May God help us in this country and give our authorities the wisdom to handle this deadly plague," John Koroma, a university student visiting his sister said.

Our press team observed after the incident that security appeared to be limited at the PCMH Cottage Hospital. The police officers on duty were inadequately protected to try to restrain an escaping EVD suspect. In fact, we observed that only one gateman in plain clothes wore gloves that night. The gloves on his hands were stained and filthy, giving the impression he had worn them all day.

There are other serious lapses that need attention apart from the inadequate security. During the 2 days observation of PCMH, we did not see any chlorine water in buckets with taps or soap for washing of hands of visitors and patients moving in or out of the hospital. There was also no evidence of hand sanitizers for people moving in and out of the various sections of the facility [It is now being admitted that although hand sanitizers kill bacteria, they have no effect on ebolavirus. - Mod.JW].

Most importantly also, there was no sensitization presence; (that is a sort of briefing centre where visitors will be given official sensitization on EVD and how to contain its spread, especially to convince and warn the unbelievers). Neither the security post nor main entrance to the hospital itself, had any form of active sensitisation about EVD going on. Throughout the whole 2 days, we did not see anyone stopping PCMH visitors to speak to them about EVD.

As we went to press, the Ministry of Health & Sanitation has yesterday [Sun 20 Jul 2014] issued a statement saying the test results from the escaped patient had now come in, and showed that the escaped patient was not EVD positive. "The case referred to was being kept in the observation unit at PCMH while her blood sample was taken to the Kenema Lassa Laboratory [Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Laboratory] for the ebolavirus test. The test result came out negative, and that patient was no longer considered a suspected EVD case," stated the Health Ministry last night [20 Jul 2014].

The ministry also reported that, currently, the number of EVD cases confirmed through laboratory testing in Sierra Leone was now over 400, and they had been reported in all 4 regions of the country.

[This is a long, detailed account of the episode, with eyewitness accounts broadcast on social media. Refer to the source URL for the full report. There appears to have been serious lack of public health education at the hospital and lack of masks and gloves for the police and hospital security. Fortunately, the case tested negative, so none of the people involved became contacts needing follow up. - Mod.JW]

[3] Sierra Leone: nurses strike

Religious leaders in Sierra Leone ... [are saying] a lack of information about the Ebola virus disease [EVD] outbreak was prompting rural communities to shun medical help. Bishop John Yambasu, chairman of an interfaith task force, said he was "seriously disappointed" the government had failed to declare a public health emergency and pump more resources into the fight against EVD, which has infected 400 people in the country. The highest number of deaths in recent weeks had been recorded in Sierra Leone, WHO said. It warned of resistance from remote rural communities to allowing access to doctors amid fears that outsiders were spreading the disease.

"Every day in this country, the number of new cases is increasing. To us as religious leaders, that is unacceptable," Yambasu, head of the United Methodist Church of Sierra Leone, told Reuters. He said the government was too concerned by the "political connotations" of declaring an emergency. Health minister Miatta Kargbo has said the EVD outbreak is "a serious matter" but has not reached emergency levels.

Dozens of nurses at a government hospital in the eastern Sierra Leone town of Kenema went on an indefinite strike on Monday [21 Jul 2014] following the deaths of 3 of their colleagues on Sunday [20 Jul 2014]. All 3 were suspected to have been infected with the deadly virus. The Kenema hospital has the only testing centre in the country for the haemorrhagic fever and holds the highest number of patients of the outbreak.

Mohamed Sheriff, a spokesman for the nurses, said they were demanding, among other things, the "immediate relocation to an isolated area of the EVD ward and its takeover by the French medical agency, MSF." The EVD wards are inside the Kenema hospital compound, which the striking workers say poses a health risk to them and to non-EVD patients. Sierra Leone's chief medical officer, Dr Brima Kargbo, said the government was looking into the nurses' grievances. Dozens of laboratory technicians at Sierra Leone's only EVD-testing facility went on strike last week [14 Jul 2014] over a USD 20 monthly risk premium, which they were promised but never paid.

Yambasu said that in Kailahun in eastern Sierra Leone -- the epicentre of the outbreak -- locals had dug trenches to bar ambulances and police from accessing their communities. Many locals regard being taken to an isolation ward as a death sentence. "It is likely that people are dying in the bush" due to lack of information about the disease, he said, adding that leaving those infected in their communities was encouraging the virus to spread.

Yambasu said religious leaders would preach in their churches and mosques for a change of attitude towards the disease and would visit the centre of the outbreak and call for change. Sierra Leone's religious leaders played a leading role in ending a brutal 1991-2002 civil war. "It is as a result of our experiences of the past that we have invited ourselves into this EVD struggle," he said.

[There appears to have been a lack of protective material for both visitors and security personnel/police at the hospital in Freetown, Sierra Leone from which a suspected case was forcibly removed.

Besides the tragic deaths of 3 nurses in Sierra Leone, 4 Liberian nurses have been admitted after contracting the ebolavirus while treating patients. They were working at Phebe Hospital in Suakoko, Bong County when they contracted the virus (http://www.newvision.co.ug/news/657836-liberian-nurses-contract-ebola-after-death-of-ugandan-doctor.html).

These infections should have been avoidable given proper personal protective equipment (PPE) and training in its use.

It is deeply regrettable, if it is true, that political considerations are interfering with public health prevention activity. - Mod.JW
