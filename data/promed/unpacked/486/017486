[1] mAB (monoclonal antibody trial) halted in severe disease

Regeneron has stopped enrolling seriously ill COVID-19 patients in a clinical trial of the antibody treatment. An independent data monitoring committee warned that the risks might outweigh the benefits for hospitalised patients on high levels of oxygen. The move comes after Eli Lilly, which is also developing a COVID-19 antibody treatment, stopped its trial in hospitalised patients earlier this week when it found this group was unlikely to benefit.

Both companies have submitted applications for an emergency use authorisation to the US Food and Drug Administration for treating patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 -- a category that included Mr Trump, who fell ill earlier this month [October 2020]. Dan Lucey, an infectious disease specialist at Georgetown University, said the regulator should convene a committee of external advisers before issuing an emergency use authorization [EUA], which has never been granted for a monoclonal antibody. "The FDA needs to carefully examine the evidence on safety -- and whether the treatments actually work -- to avoid the appearance of replicating mistakes it made issuing emergency use authorisations for hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma" to treat COVID-19, he said.

The Regeneron trial will continue in outpatients and in hospitalised patients on low or no oxygen, suggesting any safety concerns are limited to the sickest participants. But as the drug is given by a drip, it may be harder to distribute to less sick patients who are not in hospital. Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said it made sense biologically that the treatment worked to attack the virus earlier on, but did not treat the body's own potentially overactive immune response to the disease. "There is a tiny window and it's the earlier the better," he said, adding any safety problems in more seriously ill patients did not raise concerns about patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.

The trial of the Eli Lilly antibody in hospitalised patients was originally paused because of a potential safety concern in early October [2020]. But when the company announced on Monday [26 Oct 2020] it was abandoning that arm of the trial, it said differences in safety between groups were not significant.

The US government has already signed contracts for supplies of both treatments, which boost the body's immune system with artificially created antibodies. Regeneron has a USD 450m deal to manufacture and supply its antibody cocktail, while Eli Lilly announced earlier this week an initial agreement for USD 375m.

Antibody treatments could become an important tool for physicians. Despite investment in drug trials, there are still few options for treating COVID-19, and there are concerns about how well Gilead's remdesivir, the only antiviral that has been approved by the US regulator, works.

[As stated very clearly by Dr Lucey, it is imperative to carefully evaluate new treatments before issuing EUAs to avoid repetition of problems with previous rapidly issued approvals.

A review from 2015, pre-COVID addresses the use of Mab to treat viral infections:
Pelegrin M, Naranjo-Gomez M, Piechaczyk M. Antiviral monoclonal antibodies: Can they be more than simple neutralizing agents? Trends Microbiol. 2015; 23(10): 653-665. doi: 10.1016/j.tim.2015.07.005. PMID: 26433697; PMCID: PMC7127033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7127033/
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Abstract
---------
'Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are increasingly being considered as agents to fight severe viral diseases. So far, they have essentially been selected and used on the basis of their virus-neutralizing activity and/or cell-killing activity to blunt viral propagation via direct mechanisms. There is, however, accumulating evidence that they can also induce long-lasting protective antiviral immunity by recruiting the endogenous immune system of infected individuals during the period of immunotherapy. Exploiting this property may revolutionize antiviral mAb-based immunotherapies, with benefits for both patients and healthcare systems.

"Direct Mechanisms of Action of Antiviral mAbs
----------------------------------------------
"mAb therapy is a form of passive immunotherapy that is classically intended to blunt viral infections via direct and rapid targeting of the infectious agent rather than via the triggering of a long-term immune response against it. This therapeutic approach contrasts with vaccine approaches that aim to stimulate the endogenous immune response of the host, in order to provide sustained protective immunity.

"mAbs can diminish viral dissemination by direct action involving both their antigen-binding activity and the effect or functions borne by their Fc fragment. So far, most antiviral mAbs with therapeutic potential have initially (and logically) been selected for their ability to neutralize virions via the recognition of viral surface antigens essential for receptor binding and / or entry into host cells. Furthermore, direct recognition has also been shown to inhibit cell-cell transmission of virions in certain settings."

Note that Regeneron mAB (REGN-COV2) is a combination of 2 monoclonal antibodies (REGN10933 and REGN10987) and was designed specifically to block the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. - Mod.LK]

[2] Regeneron Mab cocktail reduces viral load
Date: Wed 28 Oct 2020

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-28/regeneron-s-covid-19-therapy-reduces-viral-load-need-for-care


Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. said data from a late-stage clinical trial suggest that its antibody cocktail therapy for COVID-19 significantly reduces virus levels and the need for further medical care. Patients getting the therapy were 57% less likely to need medical care within a month of treatment, with 2.8% of those given the antibody and 6.5% of those on placebo seeing a health-care worker within 29 days.

The Tarrytown, New York-based company has shared the results with US regulators who are currently evaluating the antibody cocktail for an emergency use authorization for high risk patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.

Since the therapy had similar benefits at the high and low doses, Regeneron is considering a change to the dosing it's using in other outpatient studies that are underway. The change to a lower dose could help extend the limited available supply of the medication. [It has been reported recently (https://www.biospace.com/article/regeneron-halts-enrollment-in-covid-19-trial-following-safety-signal-in-critically-ill-patients/) that Regeneron currently has only enough doses of REGN-COV2 for 50 000 people. Additionally, the company says it has an approximate manufacturing capacity of just 50 000 doses per month. This is insufficient to meet the anticipated demands of the population with mild and moderate symptoms. [It will] likely be administered directly as a preventative agent for healthcare workers and at-risk patients, like the elderly and patients with comorbidities and/or immunosuppression. - Mod.LK]

The treatment appeared to be the most potent for those at higher risk, including older patients and those with other medical conditions including obesity, heart, lung, liver, or kidney disease, the company said. Patients who had the highest viral levels, or produced the lowest levels of antibodies themselves, were most likely to respond to treatment. "We continue to see the strongest effects in patients who are most at risk for poor outcomes due to high viral load," said Chief Scientific Officer George Yancopoloulos.

Regeneron's treatment, called REGN-COV2, consists of 2 monoclonal antibodies against the coronavirus spike protein. It is considered one of the most promising potential coronavirus treatments being studied. Preliminary results from a clinical trial that Regeneron released in September showed the drug may help treat coronavirus patients outside of the hospital by reducing virus levels and symptoms, the company said.

Experimental antibody therapies could become a powerful component of the arsenal that doctors use to treat patients who've contracted coronavirus. Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious-disease official, has referred to antibody-based medicines that could treat infected patients soon after they contract the virus as a bridge to a vaccine.

Antibody therapies also are being studied in the hospital setting to treat those with more severe cases, and as short-term treatments that could be given to people such as nursing home residents or staff who may have been exposed during a local outbreak to prevent them from getting sick.

Other companies testing antibody treatments include Eli Lilly & Co, AstraZeneca Plc, and GlaxoSmithKline Plc and its partner Vir Biotechnology Inc.

[Note that 3 days before Regeneron's enrollment was halted, "Eli Lilly and Company said it also halted its clinical trial of its antibody therapy, LY-CoV555, in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. LY-CoV555 is a potent neutralizing IgG1 monoclonal antibody, and just like Regeneron's REGN-COV2, the therapy has since now been considered unlikely to help hospitalized patients with COVID-19 recover from advanced disease."

"Lilly is continuing to study their antibody therapy in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 as well as in patients with even less advanced disease. Lilly has also requested an EUA for LY-CoV555 based on data suggesting the antibody cocktail helps non-hospitalized patients.

"Unlike Regeneron, Lilly said it can supply hundreds of thousands of doses of its therapy, per an agreement with the US government. This USD 375 million agreement will help Lilly to supply up to 300 000 vials of LY-CoV555, with the potential for purchase of an additional 650 000 vials. Patients will face no out-of-pocket costs for the treatment if approved and distributed."

Kenya reported the 2nd-highest number of new COVID-19 infections in Africa over the past week, the World Health Organization (WHO) has revealed. The East African country has seen a recent resurgence of new virus cases following an easing of restrictions that lasted months.

According to figures published by WHO, Kenya recorded 4594 new COVID-19 cases over the past week, a figure shadowed only by South Africa, the continent's hardest-hit country. In the same period, Kenya registered the third-highest virus deaths in Africa. Its 71 deaths are only eclipsed by Ethiopia (73) and South Africa (536). The East African country is one of only 9 African states that have reported COVID-19 caseloads exceeding 50 000.

The Kenyan government allowed schools to reopen partially, eased a nighttime curfew, and also lifted lockdowns that had been imposed on high-risk regions, including the capital Nairobi. Besides Kenya, neighboring Ethiopia also continued to report high numbers of new COVID-19 infections. The country reported 4424 news cases in the last 7 days, the third-highest figure reported in Africa. Its total number of infections stood at 94 218 Wednesday afternoon [28 Oct 2020].

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 218.

Data by country, area, or territory for 31 Oct 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesNov1_1604264669.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 35.0% of daily case numbers and 43.4% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 20.4 million cases. The USA maintains its dominance, followed by Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Canada, and Peru. Chile, Costa Rica, and Ecuador also reported more than 1000 new cases in the past 24 hours.

- The European region reported 46.2% of daily case numbers and 34.5% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 11.0 million. Countries not reporting cases today (1 Nov 2020) include Spain, Israel, Switzerland, Kazakhstan, Sweden, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. France is dominant, followed by Italy, UK, Poland, Russia, Germany, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Ukraine, Romania, Austria, Portugal, Hungary, Croatia, Slovakia, Armenia, Turkey, and Greece. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours include Belarus, Serbia, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Georgia, Denmark. Azerbaijan, North Macedonia, and Lithuania.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.3% of daily case numbers and 10.7% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 3.0 million cases. Iran is dominant with (record-breaking highs), followed by Morocco, Jordan, Iraq, Tunisia, Lebanon, and UAE. Pakistan, Kuwait, and the Palestinian Authority each reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000, while Oman, Sudan, and Somalia did not report any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The African region reported 1.1% of daily case numbers and 1.3% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.3 million cases. South Africa is dominant, followed by Kenya, Ethiopia, Algeria, Angola, Nigeria, and Madagascar.

- The Western Pacific region reported 0.73% of daily case numbers and 0.74% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.73 million cases. As previously, the Philippines maintains its dominance, followed by Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, Guam, and China.

- The South East Asia region reported 11.7% of the daily newly reported cases and 9.3% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 9.2 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.

Impression: Unchanged. The Americas region combined with the European region account for over 80% of daily reported cases and almost 80% of the global reported deaths in the past 24 hours. Cases have somewhat declined in the South East Asian region, while overall case numbers remain below 4000 from the Western Pacific region and just below 5000 in the Africa region.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (71 321), India (46 441), France (46 290), and Italy (29 905) have been dominant. A global total of 5001 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (30-31 Oct 2020). Countries not reporting any new cases include Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, and Kyrgyzstan.

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (10 countries) include the USA, India, France, Italy, UK (23 254), Russia (18 665), Poland (17 171), Belgium (16 195), Germany (12 556), and Brazil (10 100). A total of 48 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 25 of the 48 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, and 4 are from the South East Asia region. In the past 48 hours, the UK has passed the 1 million mark of cumulative confirmed cases, bringing the count of countries reporting more than 1 million cases to 9.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 14.1%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 13.5%. The USA (dominant in the Americas region) has increased daily reported cases by 16.6% and deaths by 3.1%. Iran (dominant in the Eastern Mediterranean region) has increased daily case reports by 34.0% and deaths by 16.8%.

Impression: Global daily reported cases continue to increase with countries in the European region and the Americas region showing the largest increases in daily new cases counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. That being said, the total counts are somewhat lower today (1 Nov 2020) consistent with previously observed weekend-reporting artifact. - Mod.MPP]
