------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In response to ProMED-mail's request for information regarding the identity of the causative FMD strain currently circulating in Kyrgyzstan (and N. China/Kazakhstan?), its serotyping and genotyping, following its press-reported submission for identification to the Russian reference laboratory, we have received the following information from a reliable source:

Vladimir [= ARRIAH - All-Russian Research Institute for Animal Health, Vladimir, Russian Federation; OIE Reference Laboratory for FMD for Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Transcaucasia] has analysed samples from Kyrgyzstan and found FMD type A Iran 05 and Type 0 Panasia 2. Those strains are most probably included in their vaccine cocktail, so when Kyrgyzstan buys the Russian vaccine they are doing the right thing.

[An official confirmation (or otherwise) of the above (gratefully acknowledged) information is anticipated. It would also be helpful to obtain details of the genotyping results and vaccine matching tests, which should have been performed by ARRIAH on the recent samples from Kyrgyzstan. According to earlier press information, the virus may have been introduced from neighbouring countries, likely China. Kazakhstan has also suffered recently several FMD outbreaks, as well as undiagnosed mortality in wildlife (Saiga antelopes). FMD outbreaks and subsequent mortality in this species, had been reported in the past.

Some recent information on the FMD situation and control measures in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan may be found in the FAO report "West EurAsia FMD Control - Roadmap 2020- 3rd Regional Progress Review Meeting, Istanbul, Turkey, 27-29 Mar 2012", available on-line at http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/docs/Westeurasia_report2012/Final_report.pdf. - Mod.AS
