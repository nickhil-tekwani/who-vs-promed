A drought-related virus [how this is determined to be viral in origin is
unclear- DS] has killed at least 100 people of Tharparkar over the last two
weeks and several hundred more are reported to have been affected.
The district of Tharparkar has been drought-stricken for many months. The
illness started claiming lives in the first week of March 2000. A number of
youth and elderly people were among those fell victim to the disease during
the second week of March 2000.
According to a survey, the worst hit area is Khankhiniar Bajir village
where 36 men, women and children have so far lost their lives and a
considerable number of affected people is [are] being treated in different
hospitals and clinics.
Mortality figures include 13 deaths in Dhaklo, 11 in Kerti, 9 in Layiari
Lund, 6 each in Alamsar, Chachro, Bapuhar and Chakko, 5 in Man Bai Jo Tar
and 1 or 2 each in almost all other villages.
Despite the growing number of casualties, no measures have so far been
taken to diagnose the virus [which makes one wonder why it is assumed to be
viral in origin -DS] and provide appropriate medicines [Again, what
"appropriate medicines" consist of in the absence of an etiologic agent is
not clear. -DS].
