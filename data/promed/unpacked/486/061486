Dracunculiasis eradication: imported cases
During the second and third meetings of the International Commission for
the Certification of Dracunculiasis Eradication, it was recommended to
disseminate as widely as possible information on imported cases of
dracunculiasis.
The adult female worm (_Dracunculus medinensis_) migrates in the
subcutaneous tissue and emerges through the skin about 1 year after
infected cyclops have been ingested; these are clinical manifestations of
dracunculiasis.
Thanks to the implementation of the dracunculiasis eradication campaign,
the launching in the endemic countries of an active case search and
treatment has given momentum to a spectacular reduction in disease
occurrence. Nowadays, dracunculiasis is rarely found among immigrants in
their host countries.
In the United States of America, 2 dracunculiasis cases were notified in
Sudanese immigrants - 1 in 1995 and 1 in 1997. The first patient was a
9-year-old girl who left Sudan in September 1995 with a healing wound after
the worm emergence. Three weeks after she arrived in the United States, a
second worm emerged with a superinfection of the wound, requiring 2 weeks
of hospitalization. The second patient was a 31-year-old woman who left
Sudan in January 1997. In April of the same year, an X-ray examination
displayed calcified worms. When questioned she confirmed having had an
emerging worm the year before.
In France, large numbers of cases were notified until the 1980s among the
immigrant workers from French-speaking West Africa. The last 3 cases were
reported in 1993 and 1997. In 1993, 2 Malian workers were hospitalized at
the Saint-Louis hospital in Paris. In September 1997, a 32-year-old Malian,
a native of Sibindi, Bafoulabe Cercle in the Kayes region, was hospitalized
in the Pitie-Salpetriere hospital in Paris. This patient expelled 2 living
worms. He had been working in France since 1987 but had returned to Sibindi
between June 1996 and May 1997. The village of Sibindi was well known for a
high dracunculiasis endemicity: 60 cases were notified in 1991, 20 cases in
1996, 8 cases in 1997 and zero cases as of June 1998. The intensive case
containment activities gives hope that the disease will soon disappear from
this area.
[WER Editorial note: All countries which have already been certified as
being free of dracunculiasis transmission, or about to be certified, should
notify WHO of any imported dracunculiasis case by giving each patientÂ’s
exact country of origin and date of immigration. This information is an
essential part of the process for certification of eradication.

[It might be logical if other countries, e.g., USA, Canada, France,
Denmark, that diagnose such a case also inform Geneva and the country of
origin for the infection. - Mod.MHJ
