UFRGS confirms tetanus bacteria in vermicide
Ministry awaits official analysis of the Animal Reference Laboratory
---------------------------------------------------
According to experts of the Bacteriology Department of the Veterinary
Faculty of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), 3 of 8
bottles of vermicide Rumivac analyzed contained tetanus toxin which lead to
the death of 306 cattle and sheep in Rio Grande do Sul since 11 Jun [2001.
The result was passed to the Regional Delegation of the Ministry of
Agriculture this Friday, which is awaiting the official result from the
Animal Reference Laboratory (Lara). This analysis should be concluded in 10
days.
The president of the Champion Farmoquimico of Anapolis (GO) [Goias state,
maker of Rumivac, Flavio Alves da Rocha, affirmed there was a gross error
or falsification by the experts presented by the UFRGS. According to him
the analyses were made in open flasks. Rocha said ironically, the
scientists of Goias affirmed encountering tetanus in a product using iodine
in 56% of its composition would merit the Nobel Prize in Medicine.

[From these articles it seems likely the vermicide is administered as an
injection. If someone can confirm this as well as exactly how the product
is used, please let us know. - Mod.TG
