The Ministry of Health of Indonesia has announced 2 new cases of
human infection of H5N1 avian influenza.

A 35-year-old male from West Jakarta, Jakarta Province developed
symptoms on 16 Aug 2010, was hospitalized on 20 Aug 2010, and died on
27 Aug 2010. Initial investigations into the source of his infection
suggest a number of sudden chicken deaths occurred around the case's
house a week before onset.

The 2nd case, a 40-year-old female from Kota Depok, West Java
Province developed symptoms on 9 Sep 2010, was hospitalized on 12 Sep
2010, and died on 17 Sep 2010. Initial investigations into the source
of her infection suggest exposure at a live bird market.

For both cases, laboratory tests have confirmed infection with the
H5N1 avian influenza virus.

Of the 170 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 141 have been fatal.
