A 12-year-old girl who suffered _E. coli_ O157 infection, remained in
intensive care early Fri 6 Apr 2007, as officials continued to
investigate the source of the bacteria that infected a total of 10.
Interviews with all 10 people confirmed they ate at a Souplantation
restaurant in the city of Lake Forest on 23 or 24 Mar 2007, the
Orange County Health Agency said in a statement.
"We have not yet identified the source of the infections, and our
investigation is continuing," the agency said. The serve-yourself
salad-buffet restaurant has remained open. Health inspectors
concluded its food and conditions were safe.
The last 3 cases were confirmed Thu 5 Apr 2007, a day after health
officials announced that tests showed the 1st 7 cases all had the
same strain of _E. coli_ O157, indicating a common source of
infection.

[So far no cases have been reported from the other 8 locations in
Orange County. Since the food is prepared at a central location, it
may well be the case that contamination of the so far unidentified
vehicle occurred at the local restaurant.
Lake Forest is located in Orange County in southern California, south
of Los Angeles. The county can be found on a map at
