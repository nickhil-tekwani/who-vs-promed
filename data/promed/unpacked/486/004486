Transmission and molecular characterisation of wild measles virus in Romania, 2008 to 2012 By: Necula G, Lazar M, Stanescu A, Pistol A, Santibanez S, Mankertz A, Lupulescu E.

Background
----------
Molecular characterisation of measles virus is a powerful tool for tracing transmission. Genotyping may prove the absence of endemic circulation of measles virus, i.e. transmission for more than 12 months, which is one of the criteria for verifying elimination of the disease. We have genetically characterised measles viruses detected in Romania from 2008 to 2012, focusing on the recent outbreaks from 2010 to 2012 that affected mainly groups with limited access to healthcare and schools. The findings emphasise the importance of genotyping during the different phases of an outbreak. A total of 8170 cases were notified, and 5093 (62 percent) of the 7559 possible cases were serologically confirmed. RT-PCR was performed for 104 samples: from the 101 positive samples obtained from sporadic measles cases or clusters from different counties, 73 were genotyped. Sporadic measles cases associated with D4 and D5 viruses were observed from 2008 to 2009. Genotype D4-Manchester was predominant in 2011 and 2012. In addition, the related variant D4-Maramures and MVs/Limoges.FRA/17.10[D4] and a few D4-Hamburg strains were detected. The detection of several distinct MV-D4 genotypes suggests multiple virus importations to Romania. The outbreak associated with D4 genotype is the 2nd largest outbreak in Romania in less than 10 years.

Introduction
----------
Measles is a highly contagious respiratory viral disease characterised by the appearance of fever and a rash and that can be very serious or even fatal. Measles remains one of the leading causes of mortality in young children although a safe and cost-effective vaccine has been available for decades. Although improvements have been made to control measles in Europe, large-scale outbreaks have recently still been observed. The World Health Organisation (WHO) was forced to postpone a number of times the target date for measles elimination from the European region, most recently to 2015.

Measles has been a statutorily notifiable disease in Romania since 1978, and medical practitioners must report all clinically possible measles cases to the regional public health authorities. The 1st monovalent measles-containing vaccine was introduced in 1979 into the Romanian vaccination schedule for children aged 9 to 11 months. The combined measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine replaced the monovalent measles vaccine in 2004 and was recommended as a 1st dose for children aged 12 to 15 months. The 2nd MMR vaccine dose has been recommended since October 2005 for children aged 6 to 7 years. In the period from 2000 to 2010, the coverage for the 1st dose of measles vaccine was estimated at 95-98 percent. In 2011, measles vaccination coverage for the 1st dose of MMR vaccine was estimated at 84 percent for children aged 12 months and 93.2 percent for those aged 18 months.

Romania experienced a measles epidemic that started in December 2004 and lasted until early 2007. More than 9000 cases were detected mostly in non-immunised patients belonging to the Roma ethnic group. The outbreak was caused by the strain MVs/Bucharest.ROM/48.04/2[D4], and variants divergent by 2 nucleotides or less were detected during the period 2004 to 2006. Closely related strains were detected from 2005 to 2007 in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Serbia, Spain and Switzerland: Outbreaks associated with MVs/Bucharest.ROM/48.04/2[D4] occurred in 2005 in Germany (223 cases in Hesse, MVs/Frankfurt.DEU/03.05[D4]) and from August 2006 to February 2007 in Spain (over 200 cases in Catalonia, MVs/Barcelona.SPA/41.06/1[D4]).

D4 measles viruses are endemic in India, South-East Asia and in South Africa. Outbreaks associated with this genotype have been reported since 2007 from all continents. In Europe, many distinct variants descend from D4-Enfield (MVs/Enfield.GBR/14/07), which became endemic in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2007. The variant D4-Hamburg initiated a transmission chain of 25 000 cases that was detected in Europe for a period of more than 2 years, 2009 to 2011 [18]. In 2010, the D4 genotype became predominant in Europe.

Genetic characterisation of measles viruses constitutes an important part of laboratory surveillance. Molecular epidemiology confirms the transmission pathway of measles virus, thereby complementing classical epidemiology. Moreover, interruption of endemic measles virus transmission (i.e. circulation of a certain variant for more than 12 months) is an important criterion for verification of measles virus elimination in Europe. Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish between endemic and imported viruses using molecular methods.

This study describes the genetic characterisation of measles viruses detected in Romania from 2008 to 2012, focusing on the recent outbreaks that occurred in the country between 2010 and 2012 that affected mainly groups with limited access to healthcare facilities and schools. This study underlines the importance of measles genotyping during the different phases of an outbreak.

Discussion and Conclusions (abbreviated)
-------------------------------------
The 20 measles cases notified during 2008 to 2009 were attributed to MV-D4 and MV-D5 viruses imported from neighbouring countries and were not passed on to the general population. The situation changed with 3 outbreaks in 2010 in Tulcea and Neamt (MVs/Tulcea.ROU/08.10[D4]), (MVs/Neamt.ROU/26.10[D4]). The outbreak in Tulcea was caused by a D4-Manchester variant, whereas the viruses from Neamt and Galati (MVs/Neamt.ROU/26.10/1[D4], MVs/Galati.ROU/42.10/1[D4]) exhibited an amino acid substitution to D4-Manchester (I469L) that had previously been found only in a few French sequences deposited inMGenBank (MVs/Toulouse.FRA/07.10[D4], MVs/Limoges.FRA/17.10[D4]) and in one strain from the UK (MVs/Gloucester.GBR/12.10[D4]). This finding makes prior undetected circulation of measles virus related to MVs/Neamt.ROU/26.10/1[D4] in early 2010 unlikely. It can be assumed, therefore, that the Tulcea cluster in early 2010 and the outbreak in Neamt in mid-2010 were linked to separate importations. The 2 cases from Timis detected in December 2010 (MVs/Timis.ROU/50.10/1[D4]) had 2 nucleotide differences compared with sequences from the outbreak in Neamt and Galati, indicating a different source as well. The strain MVs/Timis.ROU/50.10/1[D4] did have the substitution I469L like the sequences from the outbreak in Neamt but shared 2 additional nucleotide changes with the strains circulating in France and the UK. The cases from the Timis and Neamt outbreaks may have been introduced from different sources, but their genetic sequences indicate a similar origin.

The variant D4-Manchester was imported in early 2010 and caused a small outbreak in Tulcea (MVs/Tulcea.ROU/08.10[D4]) but was apparently re-imported in early 2011 to Ialomita (MVs/Ialomita.ROU/06.11[D4]) and was detected as late as November 2012. Genotyped viruses in 2011 to 2012 from outbreaks in a wide geographical distribution (Ialomita, Sibiu, Arges, Constanta, Timis, Giurgiu, Caras-Severin Bucuresti, Galati, Ilfov, and Iasi, the latter with a single nucleotide mismatch) were identical to MVs/Tulcea.ROU/08.10[D4]. There is no indication of continuous circulation of D4-Manchester during the period between February 2010 and February 2011; our results suggest that it was imported for the 2nd time in early 2011. However, it is possible that some measles cases went unnoticed clinically some time after February 2010 and before February 2011, making the time window in which D4-Manchester did not circulate shorter than indicated by our data. Variant D4-Manchester apparently co-circulated with D4-Maramures in 2011 (D4-Manchester mainly in the southeast and D4-Maramures in western and central Romania) but became predominant in 2012.

Variant D4-Maramures was widely detected in 2011 and last in October 2012 in Brasov county. Because of their phylogenetic relationship and local and temporal distribution, it can be assumed that D4-Maramures and MVs/Ilfov.ROU/06.11[D4] represent 1st- and 2nd-generation descendants of D4-Manchester. Thus, the total number of measles cases attributed to the main transmission chain had reached at least 7300 notified cases by the end of 2012. We could demonstrate the establishment of D4-Manchester and its descendants as new endemic strains in Romania, circulating continuously for a time period of almost 2 years (February 2011 to November 2012). The outbreak from 2011 to 2012 associated with D4-Manchester is the 2nd large outbreak of D4 genotype in Romania within a period of less than 10 years.

In response to the measles outbreaks, a wide range of control measures were implemented, including strengthened surveillance for timely identification and monitoring of cases and outbreaks, modified immunisation schedules, and supplementary immunisation activities (approximately 4500 vaccinated) of the rural population. Despite these measures, more than 4000 of the over 30 000 cases recorded in Europe in 2011 were from Romania. In 2012, 3843 of 8230 total cases were reported by Romania to The European Surveillance System.

Frequent measles outbreaks in Romania could be the result of suboptimal vaccine coverage. It is of note that families not registered with a family physician are not represented in this analysis. Lately, a shrinking confidence in vaccination has been observed in Romania, reflecting the progress of the anti-vaccine movement all over Europe. The ethnic group of the Roma is traditionally underserved by national health services, and, moreover, a part of them refuse vaccination actively. The current and previous Romanian outbreaks started in Roma communities and underline the need to develop strategies to improve their integration into the national health services. However, we want to make clear that any under-vaccinated groups or those with a low immunity rate are highly prone to measles virus infections and represent an important factor preventing successful and sustainable elimination of measles in Romania. Our results underline the importance to strengthen immunisation programmes and to develop specific measures to address parents and their concerns regarding vaccination as well as the hard-to-reach population all over Europe.

In conclusion, a combination of epidemiological data and molecular characterisation enabled us to trace the spread of wild measles virus genotype in Romania from 2008 to 2012. Molecular surveillance of measles virus circulation in Romania will be continued to assess the effectiveness of the national measles control programme and, hopefully, to support the verification of measles elimination by the year 2015.

Parents of children at a Gwent secondary school who are not protected against measles have been sent letters urging them to organise MMR vaccinations, after a case of the virus was reported among the pupils. The single case of measles has been confirmed at Cwmcarn High School by Public Health Wales.

The school is understood to have a fairly high MMR coverage, and its web-site states that letters are being sent "to the parents of the small number of children who have not had a course of the MMR vaccine." But measles is highly infectious and is generally spread from person to person by coughs and sneezes. It is recommended that children have 2 doses of MMR vaccination -- normally given by the time a child begins school -- to provide the best possible protection against not only measles, but [also] mumps and rubella. Measles carries the risk of a range of complications, including dehydration, ear infections, pneumonia, chest infection, diarrhoea, and in rare cases (around one-in-500), permanent brain damage.

Early symptoms include a high temperature, cough, and conjunctivitis (painful); then 3 or 4 days later a red, blotchy rash appears, usually on the face initially, and spreading over the rest of the body. Parents whose children develop these symptoms and who are concerned they might have measles should keep them off school until advised that they can return, and anyone needing to consult their GP are being asked to let the practice know that it might be a case of measles.

Measles has had a high profile this year [2013] due to the outbreak in Swansea, the UK's biggest for more than a decade, and which resulted in more than 1200 cases being recorded from late 2012 into June 2013, this year. The majority of these were in Swansea, where the outbreak originated, and the surrounding area. But 130 cases were reported in Gwent, several times the number here for the whole of 2012.

Health Minister Mehmet Muezzinoglu declared that the numbers of measles cases, which had been reduced down to just 4, had jumped to an annual average of 1040. "In 2001, the number of measles cases was 31 000. Due to the vaccination program carried out between 2003 and 2005, the numbers were reduced down to just 4," he said, also claiming that the current [outbreak] had been brought under control and lowered to fewer than 20 cases per week.

"No matter how you calculate the case numbers -- which the Minister [was unable] to say were per week, per year, or per day -- you can see the level to which the measles risk has risen," an [unidentified] opposition deputy commented.

The Health Ministry has issued a statement in response to a travel warning issued by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for Americans traveling to Indonesia on a possible measles outbreak. Tjandra Yoga Aditama, the Health Ministry's director general for disease control and environmental health, said that his ministry had cooperated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the CDC to monitor the spread of measles in the country. Tjandra said that a surveillance team had monitored the disease since the travel notice was issued on 9 Dec 2013. "I have asked the CDC to provide us with the identity and travel history of the American citizen who reportedly contracted measles after traveling to Indonesia, as we will run an epidemiological study," Tjandra said on Wednesday [11 Dec 2013].

The CDC has advised travelers to "practice usual precautions" after a US traveler returned from Indonesia in August [2013] with measles and went on to spread the disease in a Texas community. Data from the federal health agency shows that health authorities in the US had found 23 measles cases between January and August 2013, with 50 percent of the cases originating from Europe, while the rest were from Asia Pacific and Africa.

The warning came after Australian health officials in mid-November also advised those traveling to Indonesia to be fully vaccinated against measles [See previous ProMED Measles updates]. Since October 2013, there have been 27 reported cases of measles in Australia, including 11 secondary cases associated with travel to Indonesia, more specifically to Bali. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also reported more than 6300 confirmed cases of measles in Indonesia from 1 Jan 2013 until the end of November 2013.

In spite of the report, the ministry appeared to play down the problem. Tjandra said that the report of a measles outbreak in Bali could have been exaggerated. "Based on the investigations conducted by our surveillance team in several community health centers [Puskesmas] in Bali, near the place where the tourists stayed, we found no KLB [extraordinary situation]," Tjandra said. He added that the Puskesmas data showed no measles outbreaks recorded throughout September or October 2013. "The investigation result also shows that the Australian tourists had no contact with people that had contracted measles during their stay in Bali," he said. Although no cases of measles were found in the area, Tjandra said that local authorities had taken precautionary measures. "However, our team will continue the surveillance program, and I have also contacted the head of Bali's health agency to take precautionary measures and report to the ministry should there be anything unusual in the area," he continued.

Health Ministry data shows that almost 100 percent of children across the archipelago have received the measles vaccination up to 2013. The data also show that the number of deaths caused by measles has dropped by 87 percent, from 10 300 cases in 2000 to less than 2000 in 2012. Contacted separately, Airlangga University laboratory head Chairul Anwar Nidom said that measles remained a dangerous disease as the virus could stay within the infected person's body for years. "People who are infected with measles have the potential to become a carrier and might continually be a source of infection for other people," Nidom told The Jakarta Post on Wednesday [11 Dec 2013]. "Even if the person contracted the virus during their childhood, traces of the virus can still be detected when they are older," he said [Persistence of measles virus in the body after recovery is not generally considered to be an important factor in the spread of measles virus infection].

The Bali Health Agency has confirmed that there has been no measles outbreak on the island in the last 3 years, saying Australian tourists could have gotten the virus from anywhere, including their home country. The Head of the Health Agency, Dr. Ketut Suarjaya, was responding to recent news of a travel advisory (see part [4] above) issued by the Australian and American governments advising their citizens about holidaying on the island.

The Australian government has warned Australians to check their measles vaccinations. The country's health authority reportedly became concerned after 5 Australians who had holidayed in Bali were diagnosed with measles over the past 5 weeks.

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) news bulletins previously reported that the acting chief health officer, Dr. Michael Ackland, said measles had been common in Bali and posed a significant risk to anyone who had not been vaccinated. "I'm particularly concerned about people in the schoolies group, who are traveling shortly, to make sure that they are vaccinated before they travel," he said. "While most people brush measles aside, it can become quite a serious illness resulting in pneumonia, and indeed, encephalitis, which is an infection of the brain." Adults aged between 33 and 47 are at high risk of contracting measles because many in that age group did not receive the vaccine when they were young.

Meanwhile, Ketut explained that there was no record of a measles outbreak on the island. "An outbreak of a communicable disease occurs when it strikes at least 10 people in one location, such as the cases of avian flu and rabies. In the case of measles, he said, there might be one or 2 cases, affecting mostly young children. "But it does not mean there is an outbreak of measles in Bali," he said, strongly responding to the news in the Australian and American media.

The Jakarta Post previously reported that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had issued a travel notice Tuesday [10 Dec 2013] for Americans traveling to Indonesia, warning them to take measures that would prevent them from contracting measles. The federal health agency urged travelers to "practice usual precautions," as a US traveler in August 2013 had returned from Indonesia with measles and spread the disease in a Texas community.

The warning came after Australian health officials in mid-November 2013 also advised those traveling to Indonesia to be fully vaccinated against measles. Since October 2013, there have been 27 reported cases of measles in Australians, including 11 secondary cases associated with travel to Indonesia, more specifically to Bali. The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported more than 6300 confirmed cases of measles in Indonesia from 1 Jan 2013 until 11 Nov 2013, this year. The WHO report was used by the CDC to issue the notice.

Suarjaya said that Bali had an early warning and surveillance system for the prevention of communicable diseases. "We have installed systems [heat sensors?] at Ngurah Rai International Airport for early prevention and detection," he said.

http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-5-219199-Causes-of-146-measles-deaths-listed-in-


An inquiry committee of the Punjab Home Department has exposed inherent contradictions in the anti-measles immunization campaign resulting in 146 casualties in Punjab this year [2013], as the vulnerable population failed to attain the desired herd immunity despite official claims of achieving 100 per cent coverage against the disease.

Revealing shocking and depressing facts, the inquiry committee identified that the anti-measles campaign was reduced to only 19 out of 36 districts, whereas the claim of optimum utilization of vaccine was belied owing to a huge gap between 14 543 500 dosages (8 017 300 measles vaccine and 6 526 200 TT vaccine) and 5 116 168 syringes (0.5 ml AD) issued against them during the year 2012, showing a gap of nearly 10 million syringes less than the actual vaccine dosages, which led to the measles fiasco in the following year. Similarly, nearly one million syringes were short in a total of 12 463 700 syringes issued against 13 446 430 dosages (8 146 820 measles vaccine and 5 399 430 TT vaccine) in 2011. However, in an attempt to cover up discrepancies between the number of vaccines and syringes, the health authorities issued nearly 3 million extra syringes in a total of 13 258 299 syringes against 10 419 200 (7 759 000 measles vaccine and 2 660 200 TT vaccine) in 2013.

The inquiry committee, headed by Punjab Home Secretary Shahid Khan (Convener) along with 2 members -- KEMU Vice-Chancellor Prof Faisal Masood and Additional Secretary Nasim Sadiq -- presented its fact-finding report on 10 Jun 2013, prima-facie declaring the Provincial Steering Committee as guilty of negligence and dereliction of its duties and fixed the responsibility on the then Health Director General(s) including Dr Muhammad Aslam Ch (presently on leave), who served from 3 Oct 2005, to 23 Jan 2012, and Dr Nisar Ahmed Cheema (retired), who served from 21 Feb 2012 to 31 Mar 2013. Besides, the supervisory tiers in the health administration have also failed to prevent the aforesaid dereliction or initiate corrective measures.

Up till 10 Jun 2013, when the fact-finding report was submitted, a total of 16 620 cases have been reported across the province resulting in 146 deaths. Lahore district, which showed 88 per cent coverage, topped with 80 measles deaths, while 10 deaths were reported in Kasur, 9 in Sheikhupura, 6 in Rajanpur, 5 each in Gujranwala, Jhang, Okara and Rahim Yar Khan, 4 in Faisalabad, 3 in Vehari, 2 each in Bahawalpur and Narowal, and one each in Rawalpindi, Hafizabad, Mandi Bahauddin, Sialkot, Khanewal, Sahiwal, Pakpattan, Toba Tek Singh, Sargodha and Bahawalnagar. Remaining districts showed zero casualties.

Another inquiry report on the epidemic of measles was prepared by Prof Zafar Iqbal, Chairman, Shaikh Zayed Hospital, Lahore, and a summary was also prepared by the then Chief Secretary, Punjab Javaid Aslam to fix the responsibility on the negligent that, surprisingly, omitted one of the guilty mentioned in the 1st report and included 4 other people.

The home department's committee further reported that the Federal Ombudsman had also conducted an inquiry into the measles outbreak, which concluded that the main cause of the epidemic was a deterioration and failure of the routine EPI system in Pakistan.

While noting its findings, the committee identified that 2 mass immunization campaigns had been conducted in years 2007-08 and 2010-11. During the 2007-08 campaign, children from 9 months to 13 years were vaccinated against measles throughout the country. During the 2010-11 campaign, 19 districts of Punjab were covered in 2 phases. In the 1st phase, vaccinations were given in Mianwali, Khushab, Bhakkar, Layyah, DG Khan, Muzaffargarh, Rajanpur and RY Khan, whereas in the 2nd phase, vaccinations were administered in Lahore, Rawalpindi, Multan, Sargodha, Sialkot, Hafizabad, Jhang, Nankana Sahib, Gujrat, Chakwal and Attock. Thereafter, the National Steering Committee did not recommend a mass measles campaign; therefore, measures were taken only to ensure availability of vaccine as per requirement. Measles cases are being reported in districts covered under the 2010-11 mass immunization campaign like Lahore, Sialkot and Jhang.

The reported EPI coverage during the last 5 years starting from 2008 is 87 percent, 88 percent, 92 percent, 95 percent and 100 percent. The survey conducted by the Institute of Public Health (IPH), Lahore narrates the overall coverage of 58 percent against the reported figures of 100 percent in year 2013.

The committee observed that EPI coverage figures for the last 5 years oscillate between 88 to 100 percent, meaning thereby a success rate of 80 percent should have been attained in all districts of the Punjab, although, the DG Health Services contended that the herd immunity for measles took place at 95 percent. Based on the figures provided since the 2010-11 mass immunization campaign in 19 districts of the Punjab, the proportionate reduction in the vaccinated population had taken place; therefore, herd immunity would be hovering between 80 and 90 percent.

The health authorities admitted that the mass immunization programme in the Punjab was restricted to 19 districts only. It also admitted that the regular immunization programme based on the data produced before this committee was unsuccessful. Finally, the monitoring mechanism also rendered the immunization campaign faulty.

The committee concluded that the regular immunization programme, when viewed in the context of its administration, human resource management, distribution, cold chain continuity, and other allied aspects, was not successful. The reporting of vaccine utilization in particular was forged or exaggerated. This is substantiated by the monitoring mechanism put in place, which reduced the coverage of immunization by at least an average of 25-30 per cent. More importantly, the current outbreak of measles with 146 deaths in the province and around 5021 patients in Lahore only manifests an epidemic which has exposed ineffectiveness and insufficient coverage of the earlier campaigns.

The information provided to the committee established that, over the 5 years, the provincial steering committee responsible for evaluating and extending the programme either through the federal government or its own recourses failed on both counts. The minutes of meetings dated 3 Jan 2013 and 21 Jan 2013 identified the need of a high quality measles campaign in all 36 district but the same were in any case either untimely or not adequately pursued for turning such a campaign into reality. It is established that the provincial steering committee did not take up the matter of mass immunization with the federal government. No formal reference to the federal government to extend the mass immunization from 19 to 36 districts has been produced before the committee.

It also didn't launch the programme through provincial resources except for spending a sum of Rs 701 million [USD 6.6 million] for an extended coverage in 12 high risk districts in 2013. Out of this, Rs 243 million [USD 2.2 million] were used on procurement of vaccine through UNICEF in February 2013 for use in the Lahore campaign and mop up operation in April 2013. A total of Rs 458 million [USD 4.3 million] have been deposited with UNICEF for the campaign in 12 high risk districts.

Some other factors also contributed to the recent measles outbreak like malnutrition, poor maternal health, and poor public health facilities (safe water, sewerage disposal and healthy food chain). The health authorities did not undertake a pragmatic assessment of the programme identifying the gaps and proposing measures to overcome pitfalls. It is a fact that the Health Care Management System is sliding on a downward track due to lack of direction, corruption and inefficiency. This situation is further compounded with a general lack of awareness about the importance of immunization to prevent the disease, which has been wiped out not only in developed countries but also in several developing countries. Despite ratification of the UN convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which recognizes vulnerability of children to disease and requirements for special care and assistance, the response of the supervisory tiers of the health department is dismal. The loss of precious lives clearly indicates that the health authorities and allied departments have failed to effectively administer the measles immunization campaign.

The Department of Health [DOH] on Wednesday [11 Dec 2013] advised residents in Metro Manila to take precautions against measles after noting 2 deaths and a rise in cases in at least 5 cities in the National Capital Region [NCR].

In a statement posted on the government website, DOH Metro Manila head Eduardo Janairo cited records showing a rapid rise in measles cases in Las Pinas, Muntinlupa, Caloocan, Manila, and Paranaque. "Everyone should take necessary precaution because measles is a severe disease that causes complications like ear infections, pneumonia and even inflammation of the brain. It is also highly contagious and can be spread easily through cough and sneeze and direct contact with affected persons through nose or mouth secretions," Janairo said. The DOH Metro Manila said its records showed the fatalities came from Malabon and Muntinlupa. It added that most of those affected were 1-4 years old, and most were male.

Janairo advised parents and guardians of children to look out for symptoms: "If you believe you have been exposed to someone with measles, you should watch for measles symptoms to appear after 9 days. Some persons can be affected immediately before the rash appears, 4 days after being exposed," he said. Janairo also advised the public to make sure they and members of their families are up to date on measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccines and other age-appropriate immunisations. "Measles vaccination not only protects the person but also serves as safeguard to family members who are too young to get the vaccine or haven't received it yet. Receiving 2 doses of measles vaccine is highly effective in preventing measles," he said.

Citing partial reports from the Regional Epidemiology Surveillance Unit, the DOH said there were 179 confirmed measles cases from 1 Jan to 10 Dec 2013. It said this was 616 percent higher compared to the same period last year [2012], with only 25 cases recorded. For this year, the ages of cases ranged from one month to 37 years. Most of those affected were 1-4 years old, and most were male.

The cities with the largest numbers of measles cases were:
- Las Pinas, 44 cases
- Muntinlupa, 32
- Caloocan, 26
- Manila, 22
- Paranaque, 15
- Malabon, 10
- Quezon City, 8
- Taguig, 8
- Navotas, 7
- Pasay, 4
- Makati, 2
- Pasig, 1
- Mandaluyong, Marikina, San Juan and Valenzuela Cities, along with Pateros town, recorded zero cases so far.

Meanwhile, the DOH Metro Manila dispatched teams of nurses who will act as an Anti-Measles Task Force to identify areas in the NCR. It said the nurses will "assist in evaluating patients and provide the necessary vaccination to prevent further transmission of the disease." Janairo urged all parents and caregivers of children aged 0-12 years old to go the nearest health center and have their children immunized against measles.

Further, the DOH Metro Manila advised the public to report suspected measles cases to a health care provider before going to a hospital. It said a suspected measles case must 1st be evaluated as a precaution and protection for other patients and health workers from possible infection. The DOH noted measles can easily be spread through the air when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes. Measles infection in a pregnant woman can lead to miscarriage, premature birth, or a low birth-weight baby, it said. "Those who have developed symptoms of measles should stay away from public places such as work, school, child care settings, shops, and public transport to avoid putting others at risk," it said.

Of the 175 cases of measles in the US in 2013, a mere 23 were connected to Hare Krishnas in North Carolina. The 175 cases were triple the national average in previous years. Embarrassingly enough, the largest group of people infected with measles came from our very own anti-vaccination group of Brooklyn Hareidi Jews. 30 cases of measles were diagnosed in Williamsburg, and another 28 were diagnosed in Borough Park, accounting for 1/3rd of the cases in the US in 2013. It was the largest measles outbreak in 15 years.

The original outbreak came from a London ultra-Orthodox community, which also refuses to stop endangering everyone else. An intentionally unvaccinated Hareidi teenager brought the disease back with him to the US. In July 2013, the NYC Department of Health said that that outbreak was over. But it was hardly the only case. There was a measles outbreak in these communities in 2011. And in 2010, another child brought back mumps with him from England, infecting fellow Jewish campers in upstate NY, who brought the disease home with them to Monsey and New Square, resulting in over 300 infected people.

[Previously, readers have pointed out that, contrary to a belief held by some commentators, Jewish law does not prohibit vaccination, but, rather, recommends it.
