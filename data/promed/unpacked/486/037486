------------------------------
The fact that nearly 5000 inmates of Pollsmoor Prison, Western Cape, South Africa, are being moved to other prisons because of a presumed leptospirosis outbreak due to rat infestation, prompts some questions as to the possible real nature of the infectious process.

We are not told the main presenting symptoms of this outbreak, nor the causes of the eventual death of 2 prisoners, nor are we informed exactly which laboratory tests confirmed in fact a leptospiral origin. Severe leptospirosis outbreaks are traditionally ascribed to increased human exposure to infected rats' urine, e.g., after local floods. This is an unlikely scenario for a prison outbreak, although described as "highly infectious", thus suggesting there were many cases indeed.

In theory, another explanation could be massive food contamination with _Streptobacillus moniliformis_, causing an epidemic of the so-called "Haverhill fever." However, such an outbreak, also caused by infected rats' urine, is rarely fatal, and has mostly milder symptoms, moreover different (rash, arthralgiae, etc.) from leptospirosis. Neither leptospiral and streptobacillary fever has person-to-person transmission, whereas massive food contamination by leptospira themselves could in theory affect many consumers indeed, but is very rarely fatal.

Thus, other ways of transmission of a highly contagious pathogen come under suspicion, such as aerosol transmission of a respiratory virus in the prisoners' premises, causing (sometimes fatal) multi-organ failure (MOF), and perfectly mimicking leptospirosis in all clinical -- and even in virtually all laboratory -- aspects, namely hantavirus [1]. More particularly in this case, Seoul virus (SEOV), the only cosmopolite hantavirus, spread over 5 continents by the wild rat. Human SEOV infection has never been reported so far from Africa, and the so-called absence, or at best very scant and anecdotical evidence, of any "hantavirus fever" case in Africa, is typical for the ever-increasing blind spot for pioneer data in hantavirus research.

Between 1981 and 1985, HW Lee et al. showed for the 1st time a hantaviral prevalence of 1.3 percent (6/458) in Egyptian human sera, and of 20 percent (499/2499) in Egyptian urban rats, from which moreover 2 SEOV strains were isolated, R/12914 and R/13120 [2]. With these hantavirus isolations, Africa (not Europe, nor the Americas) became the 2nd continent to possess undeniable evidence of a local and pathogenic hantavirus presence, right after the Far-East (Korea, and later China). Moreover, HW Lee et al. also showed hantavirus infection in 8 (28/352) of urban rats from Sudan and in 4.3 percent (15/355) of human sera from Uganda [2]. Shortly thereafter (1984), Gonzalez et al. reported similar serologic evidence of "Hantaan-related viruses" in other African countries [3]. Dr. Harry Hoogstraal, the renowned American entomologist working in Cairo, found again, and in collaboration with HW Lee's Korean team, a 1.5 percent (3/198) seroprevalence in humans, and 23 percent seropositivity in 1846 wild rats, both from Egypt. Moreover, the 1983 positivity rate in urban rats from Cairo was extremely high at 42.2 percent [4].

At the first ISN (Int. Society of Nephrology)-sponsored conference of nephrology on the African continent, we reported hantaviral IgG antibody presence in human sera from 10 different African countries, with prevalences ranging from 6.1 percent (Senegal) to 0.4 percent (Rwanda, and equally, Kenya) [5]. For comparison, the most endemic country in the world for hantavirus, Finland, has an overall seroprevalence of "only" 5 percent. In our hands, 286 sera from Zaire (now called Democratic Republic of Congo) were seronegative for hantavirus [5]. However, at that time we did not have the opportunity to examine human or animal sera from South Africa. Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was in the early 1980s the only available serological assay, using the murine Korean prototype Hantaan virus (HTNV) as global screening antigen. Since this HTNV has an obvious cross-reactivity with the likewise murine SEOV, and since virtually all positive African rodents examined at that time were in fact carriers of SEOV (i.e., wild rats), it can retrospectively be assumed that the most widespread hantaviral pathogen in Africa was (and probably still is) SEOV, a finding now seemingly forgotten. Moreover, the true SEOV origin of positive Egyptian human and rat sera was in 1992 confirmed in HW Lee's Seoul lab by the gold standard of hantavirus (convalescent) serotyping, being plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) [6].

China registered hitherto, and since 1950, up to 1.5 million human hantavirus cases, or more than 90 percent of all cases worldwide, with SEOV being the 2nd most prevalent Chinese pathogen, just after HTNV [7]. SEOV has thus to be considered as an important pathogen, and since the rodent carrier of HTNV, _Apodemus agrarius Coreae_ (striped Korean field mouse) is completely absent outside of the Far East, SEOV can be considered as a (heavily underestimated) candidate for human hantavirus infections in every area with a documented local wild rat presence, i.e., worldwide.

The diagnostic problem is becoming even more complex, since we recently documented concomitant dual leptospirosis-hantavirus infection in acute cases suspected of, or even hospitalized for, acute leptospirosis with MOF in Sri Lanka [8] and in Belgium [9], with the wild rat as the most probable common infection source (manuscript with confirmation tests in preparation). This means that in common clinical practice, a lab confirmation of a suspected leptospirosis case is no longer sufficient for "closing the case", even less so for forthcoming epidemiological studies. Indeed, both zoonotic infections have a good prognosis, except for the fatalities in the acute phase, and both show a complete remission within 2-3 weeks, without any remaining sequelae from all previous expressions of MOF [1]. Distinguishing between the clinically completely similar leptospira/hantavirus infections remains important however, since only for proven leptospirosis cases is the use of antibiotics helpful, at least if administered early enough [8].

In conclusion, the current Pollsmoor Prison outbreak offers an excellent opportunity to test all named clinical and biological aspects of this hypothesis, reckoning however with the many fallacies inherent to searching for a "new" hantavirus in regions hitherto considered "non-endemic", as was the case before in Sri Lanka [8] and in India [10].
