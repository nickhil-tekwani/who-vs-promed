[Of note, the case fatality rate is 100 percent. Such occurrences are
not uncommon with this virus I am told by my trusted colleague, Dr.
Chika Nwosuh at the National Veterinary Research Laboratory in Vom,
Nigeria. They have seen cases where hundreds of birds have died in a
couple of days, so clearly this virus in West Africa has the
propensity to kill birds. Given this is the 1st occurrence in Ghana,
a very intense outbreak investigation should try to identify how the
virus arrived there. After H5N1 has been in West Africa for a year or
more, it is imperative that we begin to unravel the mode of spread of
this virus if we are to control it.
The Ghana animal health authorities are to be complemented on the
speed and transparency evidenced by this report. - Mod.PC]
