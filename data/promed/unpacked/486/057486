2002/017 Research on a new disease of sugarbeet in France: 'Syndrome
des Basses Richesses'
--------------------
In France, a new disease of sugarbeet appeared in Bourgogne and
Franche-Comte regions in 1991. This disease, which was called
'Syndrome des Basses Richesses,' is of uncertain aetiology. Symptoms
include yellowing and curling of old leaves, leading to the new growth
of central leaves that appear chlorotic, lanceolated, and
asymmetrical. Roots are of normal size but contain brown vascular
bundles, and their sugar content suddenly decreases at the beginning
of September.
Since 1991, this disease has occurred with variable severity in these
regions. Economic losses could be observed due to the poor sugar
content of affected roots. Considering the apparent aerial
transmission of the disease, the similarity of symptoms with yellow
wilt (phytoplasma disease) and the detection of phytoplasmas in
affected plants, it is strongly suspected that phytoplasmas are
involved in the disease. However, the presence of detectable
phytoplasma DNA in leaves and roots could not reliably be related to
the expression of symptoms.
In 1997 and 1998 in Franche-Comte, searches were made for potential
phytoplasma vectors in an area where sugarbeet crops had been affected
by the disease since 1996. Results revealed the presence of a cixiid,
tentatively identified as _Pentastiridius beieri__ (full determination
is not yet finalized). High populations of this insect were observed
in sugarbeet plots during summer. In addition, _Stolbur phytoplasma_
(EPPO A2 quarantine pest) was detected in several individuals (and
also in diseased sugarbeet). Experiments showed that _P. beieri_ could
transmit Stolbur phytoplasma to periwinkle and sugarbeet. So far, only
_Hyalesthes obsoletus_ was a known vector of Stolbur phytoplasma.
Research will continue to better understand the aetiology and
epidemiology of this new sugarbeet disease.
