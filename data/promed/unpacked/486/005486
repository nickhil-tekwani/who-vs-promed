The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported last week [week of 18 Aug 2014] the apparent 1st human case of influenza A (H3N2) variant (H3N2)v virus in Ohio.

The infected patient was hospitalized as a result of H3N2v illness, but has completely recovered. No ongoing human-to-human transmission has been identified and the case [did report] close contact with swine in the week prior to illness onset. Public health and agriculture officials are investigating the extent of disease among humans and swine and no increases in influenza-like illness in the community have been reported.

Genetic sequencing of the H3N2v virus conducted at CDC showed that this virus has the nucleoprotein (NP) and the matrix (M) gene from the 2009 H1N1 virus, which is a slightly different combination of internal genes than H3N2v viruses reported in previous years. However, this H3N2v virus has the same genetic composition as influenza viruses previously isolated from swine in the US this summer [2014].

In 2013, the CDC tallied 19 H3N2v from 5 states, while in 2012, the federal health agency reported 309 cases. The 1st year the novel influenza virus surfaced was 2011 when 12 people were reportedly infected. H3N2v is a non-human influenza virus that normally circulates in pigs and that has infected humans. Viruses that normally circulate in pigs are "swine influenza viruses." When these viruses infect humans, they are termed "variant" viruses.

Symptoms of H3N2v infection in people are similar to those of seasonal flu viruses and can include fever and respiratory symptoms, such as cough and runny nose, and possibly other symptoms, such as body aches, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Infections with influenza viruses (including variant viruses like H3N2v) can sometimes cause severe disease, even in healthy people. This can include complications, such as pneumonia, which may require hospitalization, and sometimes results in death.

People who are at high risk of developing complications if they get influenza include children younger than 5 years of age, people 65 years of age and older, pregnant women, and people with certain long-term health conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, weakened immune systems, and neurological or neurodevelopmental conditions.

[As far as I can tell, this is the 1st case of influenza A H3N2v to occur in a human this year (2014). H3N2v is primarily a swine influenza virus that has resulted in direct transmission to humans and occasional secondary human-to-human cases, but without sustained transmission in humans. There are no details provided of the exposure of this patient to swine (other than to say that it occurred within the week prior to illness), but many cases in previous years have occurred after exposure to swine at agricultural fairs. The patient here is described as being hospitalized, presumably with serious illness, but to have recovered.

This influenza strain is distinct from the H3N2 human strain that circulated widely during this year's (2014) influenza season in North America and elsewhere. Prior H3N2v strains have all been susceptible to oseltamivir.
