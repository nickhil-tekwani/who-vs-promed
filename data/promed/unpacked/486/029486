CHIKUNGUNYA VACCINE: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

Given the recent ProMED messages concerning the spread of chikungunya
in India (17 Oct 2006, Archive 20061017.2986), Sri Lanka (29 Nov
2006, Archive 20061129.3380), and the Maldives (24 Dec 2006, Archive
20061224.3598), it would be helpful to have a knowledgeable update
about progress toward developing and distributing a vaccine against
the disease.
The US Army discontinued development of such a vaccine in the 1990's,
reportedly because of changing budget priorities. However, on 14 Sep
2006 the US Embassy in Paris announced there would a resumption of
development of a vaccine, in collaboration with the US Military
Infectious Disease Program and the US Department of Health & Human
Services, the French Ministry of Health, and Inserm and the Institut
Pasteur. This announcement followed an agreement on 6 Sep [2006] to
allow transfer of research records, vaccine supplies, and seed stocks
for manufacturing vaccine, from the US to the French. (see
<http://www.amb-usa.fr/texts/chikungunya.pdf>)
Also, on 25 Oct 2006 a news story in India
(<http://newstodaynet.com/25oct/ss7.htm>) said that the BCG Vaccine
Laboratory in Chennai had been sequencing different strains of the
chikungunya virus and had applied for a patent to manufacture
vaccine(s) against the virus for commercial sale. However, it is not
clear to what extent the news story was an indication of real
progress in independently developing a vaccine, as distinct from
publicity to encourage investment in the laboratory's efforts.
In this context, could anyone provide further and better information
on what progress has been made toward producing a vaccine?

[ProMED would appreciate receiving any information about chikungunya
virus vaccine development. It is difficult to attract commercial
biologics companies to take on the high costs to develop vaccines for
viral infections with low mortality but high morbidity that occur
sporadically in developing countries, such as chikungunya, and where
markets for the product are constrained economically. News of
progress in development of a chikungunya virus vaccine by the Indian
vaccine company BCG, as mentioned above, is awaited with interest. - Mod.TY]
