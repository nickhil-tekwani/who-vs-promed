As of [10 Jun 2020], 37 cases of tickborne encephalitis or attenuated flu-like forms linked to the consumption of raw milk goat cheeses have been reported to the regional health agency (ARS).

Investigations have confirmed the diagnosis of tickborne encephalitis virus (TBE) infection in 28 cases, while 9 are still under investigation. These cases correspond to the same outbreak, [linked to] the virus in raw goat milk and a batch of raw milk cheeses, produced by the GAEC des Chevrettes du Vieux Valey, located at Condamine in Haut-Bugey.

The GAEC des Chevrettes du Vieux Valey organized a recall for its products as of [28 May 2020]. Among the 9 cases identified since this operation, 7 relate to previously sick people, now recovered, and for whom a retrospective biological confirmation has been requested. For 2 patients identified on 28 and 31 May [2020], contamination prior to recall is consistent with an incubation period of about one week between infection and the onset of symptoms.

In a press release sent yesterday [Sun 14 Jun 2020] to our editorial office, Prefecture of Ain and Regional Health Agency (ARS) specified that "human infection by the TBE virus through food is exceptional: the presence of this virus in cheeses is extremely rare, even in areas where ticks are infected. The presence of the virus in GAEC goat cheeses is linked to the presence of ticks carrying the virus in the pastures where its livestock are present. It, therefore, has no link with the quality of GAEC's breeding and dairy processing practices."

[This report provides additional information about the tickborne encephalitis (TBE) cases related to consumption of raw (unpasteurized) cheese in eastern France. No evidence of TBE virus infection in cows and goats of the region is presented in the above report or the previous one, nor if ticks are active in the area and are infected and can be ruled out as vectors there. Ixodes ticks are the major source of TBE virus infections across the broad geographic area where the virus is endemic. Infected lactating goats and cattle can pass the virus into their milk with the risk of people becoming infected if raw milk is consumed.

The TBE-infected individuals in the above report were from eastern France, a province adjacent to Switzerland, a country in which TBE is endemic and where many human cases occur. According to WHO, "Approximately 10 000-12 000 clinical cases of TBE are reported each year, but this figure is believed to be significantly lower than the actual total." In addition, "Immunization offers the most effective protection. Currently, there are 4 widely used vaccines of assured quality. The 4 vaccines are considered to be safe and efficacious" (see https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/19-02-2020-immunization-is-the-best-protection-against-tick-borne-encephalitis).

Tickborne encephalitis is a viral infection caused by one of 3 tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) subtypes belonging to the _Flaviviridae_ family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ixodes ticks. - Mod.TY
