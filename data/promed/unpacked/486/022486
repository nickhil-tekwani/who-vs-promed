Five people were killed following an outbreak of cholera in Nigeria's southern state of Bayelsa, local authorities said on Thursday [9 Dec 2021]. At least 22 cases of the water-borne disease have been reported following the outbreak in Ofoni community, a coastline settlement in Sagbama local government area of the oil-rich state since last weekend, Pabara Igwele, the state's commissioner for health, told reporters at a press briefing in the state capital Yenagoa.

Igwele said samples were taken and tests confirmed the cases, describing the development as "an emergency situation that needs an emergency response."

"For now, I know it is quite worrisome. Within the next 24 hours, we will be able to handle and curb the situation to prevent further spread of the bacteria," he said.

So far, the state government had mobilized a rapid response team to move into the affected community to curb the spread of the disease, the official said. The officials in Bayelsa have made contact with the country representative of the World Health Organization and the UNICEF for support, Igwele said, adding support was underway toward addressing the situation.

As of September [2021], the Nigeria Center for Disease Control confirmed over 2000 cholera-related deaths and more than 65 000 suspected cases since January 2021 across the country.

More than 30 cases of cholera, including 12 deaths, have been recorded in less than 3 days in South Kivu province in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). While speaking to reporters, the chief medical officer of the Kumbi Lulenge health zone, Cos Kenemo, said that the 1st case was recorded on Saturday [4 Dec 2021] and could have spread from the Miba village mining area. The outbreak has affected the Kumbi Lulenge health zone in Fizi territory.

Patients have been arriving at the hospital in critical condition, a situation that could be responsible for the high number of deaths, he said.

Kenemo advised residents to consume boiled drinking water and ensure proper food preparation, and he appealed for a cholera treatment center to be established in the area to contain the situation.

As of 17 Oct 2021, a total of 5950 suspected cholera cases, including 117 deaths, were reported in 79 health zones in 15 provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, according to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control.

[4] Diarrhea: India (Andhra Pradesh)

As many as 30 residents of Arundathi Vaada village under Somala mandal fell sick with vomiting and loose motions since Tuesday night [7 Dec 2021]. They were shifted to different hospitals including in Tirupati, Piler, and Sadum. According to information, the residents of Aundathi Vaada, which has about 500 houses, suddenly took ill with vomiting and diarrhea. The other villagers called for 108 ambulances and admitted them to the Somala health wellness centre.

As the number of patients began to swell, some were sent to Piler, and some, whose condition became serious, were shifted to Ruia hospital in Tirupati. Police who received the information alerted the medical officials on the incident. District medical and health officer (DMHO) Dr Srihari, who visited the village on Wednesday [8 Dec 2021], opined that the bad sanitation might be the reason behind the sickness.

He said he will send the report to the state medical officers about the incidents. Local public representatives, including former MPTC Ramanaiah and panchayat vice-president Chakrapani, reached the village and took up relief measures. A government teacher who was among the victims said water contamination as well as lack of proper sanitation were the reason for the sickness. Health officer Manasa said contaminated water might be the reason.

Rural Water Supply (RWS) deputy engineer Venkateswarlu who visited the village said the water samples were sent for testing, but no contaminants were found. The panchayat officials took up chlorination of water and sprinkled bleaching powder in the village. Police, panchayat raj, and health and medical staff camped in the village to provide immediate help to the people who fell sick. The villagers suspect that the contaminated water might have seeped into drinking water system and urged the RWS officials to check.

[As stated by Lutwick et al. (Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P. Cholera. In Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Edited by Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J. New York: Nova Bioscience; 2017, pp 113-127), oral rehydration therapy can be lifesaving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Guerrant et al. (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it first recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al. (1) highlight the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30% to 3.6% (4) and quote sources referring to ORT as 'potentially the most important medical advance' of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally, glucose or rice powder based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 mL/kg followed by 100 mL/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 mL/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
