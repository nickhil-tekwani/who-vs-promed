Mexico: West Nile virus infection surveillance data
---------------------------------------------------
[The following updated figures have been extracted from the Resumen
Epidemiologico file accompanying the pictorial Maps of West Nile Virus
Activity in Mexico.
<http://www.cenave.gob.mx/von/archivos/ResumenCASOSVON.xls> - Mod.CP]
Cumulative totals - humans
--------------------------
As of Thu 2 Dec 2004, the cumulative total of human tests carried out in
Mexico has increased by 161 from 226 to 387, and no additional seropositive
individuals have been detected: that is, in total, 387 individuals resident
in 29 of the 32 states have been tested for evidence of West Nile virus
infection; 386 were seronegative and asymptomatic, and one individual in
the state of Sonora exhibited signs of disease [see: West Nile virus -
Mexico (Sonora) 20040905.2486].
Cumulative totals - equines
---------------------------
As of Thu 2 Dec 2004, a total of 3394 horses from all 32 states had been
tested for evidence of West Nile virus infection. Of these animals, 2443
were seronegative and 851 (28 per cent) were seropositive. All the
seropositive animals were asymptomatic. These figures represent an
additional 276 animals tested since Thu 18 Nov 2004, 157 of which were
seronegative.
Cumulative totals - birds
-------------------------
As of Thu 3 Dec 2004, the number of birds tested remains unchanged at 4940
(given wrongly as 44 940 previously) since the previous update on Thu 4 Nov
2004. These birds were collected from 8 of the 32 states and have been
tested for evidence of West Nile virus infection. Of these birds, 4750 were
seronegative and 188 were seropositive (and considered to be asymptomatic),
and one case in the state of Sonora, and one case in the state of Baja
California, exhibited signs of disease. (Initially, both birds appear to
have been assigned to the state of Sonora). The seropositive birds were
detected in the states of Baja California, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, Queretaro,
Sonora, and Yucatan. [Sonora state, where the single human case and one of
the 2 avian cases were confirmed, shares its northern border with the state
of Arizona in the USA. - Mod.CP]
[It is noteworthy that horses in Mexico are continuing to test
seropositive, but none exhibit signs /symptoms of disease. No equine data
for the USA have been published since 18 Nov 2004. - Mod.CP]

Northern California: West Nile virus season winding down
--------------------------------------------------------
Colder temperatures and a decrease in mosquitoes have caused the Amador
County West Nile Task Force to report that West Nile Virus season is
winding down. "Colder weather means fewer mosquitoes and that means less
West Nile activity," Amador County Agriculture Commissioner Mike Boitano said.
Amador County saw no human cases of WNV this year, but 9 birds did test
positive for the disease. "These were birds from all areas of the county
except the high country," said Boitano. "However, no other animals tested
positive. This is significant because horses can get West Nile if not
immunized."
On the other hand, statistics show that California was hit hard by WNV,
according to a news release issued by the task force. "There have been over
800 human cases in California this year, far more than any other state,"
the release stated. A total of 24 California residents died from WNV, with
most deaths occurring in Southern California.
"Death is rare in West Nile infection and it usually strikes those with
weak immune systems," Dr Bob Hartmann, Amador County health officer, said
in the release. Hartmann also said that the human cases closest to Amador
County were in San Joaquin and Sacramento Counties. The closest horse with
WNV was from Lockeford. "If West Nile follows typical patterns, we're
expecting the next year or 2 to be rough in Northern California. The best
prevention is to protect yourself from mosquito bites," Hartmann advised.
Most individuals who are infected with WNV will not experience any illness,
the county's health department reported. Up to 20 per cent of infected
individuals will have only mild to moderate symptoms, such as fever,
headache and body aches. Less than one per cent of individuals will develop
serious neurological illness such as encephalitis and meningitis. The
elderly and those with lowered immune systems are more susceptible to
serious illness.
The county has embarked on an ongoing public education campaign since early
spring, reminding people to eliminate mosquito breeding grounds and to
avoid mosquito bites. The county's agricultural department has mosquito
fish, which feed on mosquito larvae, free to the public at its office
located at 12380 Airport Road in Martell. In addition, the county's WNV
Task Force meets regularly to discuss the county's strategy for the
disease. The health department or agricultural department can provide
presentations on the disease to county civic and service clubs.

Florida: summer hurricanes in 2004 reduce West Nile virus toll
--------------------------------------------------------------
Florida's string of hurricanes this summer may have helped the state avoid
another record year of the potentially lethal West Nile virus infection.
The peak season for the mosquitoborne infection is fizzling to a close with
only half as many human infections as in 2003. A mild season played out in
much of the United States, where the virus sickened more than 9800 people
and killed 264 in a rampant outbreak in 2003. In contrast, the national
tally stands at about 2300 human cases so far in 2004 and about 80 deaths.
Experts can't say exactly why West Nile dropped off in 2004, and they
caution that the virus easily could roar back in the future. But 2 factors
likely prevented a nastier outbreak in Florida: heavy use of insecticides
to kill mosquitoes and, ironically, the drenching hurricanes that plagued
the state in August and September. "I think [Florida] caught a break when
those hurricanes came through and kind of rearranged everything," said
Dickson Despommier, a professor of microbiology and public health at
Columbia University in New York. "You had birds and mosquitoes blown all
over the place, basically disrupting" the life cycles of the insects and
animals that foster the disease.
41 people have been diagnosed with West Nile in Florida this year, and 2 of
them died from the infection, compared with 94 human cases and 6 deaths in
2003. But before the hurricanes, health officials were bracing for a
potentially devastating summer. 5 people had fallen sick with West Nile in
Miami-Dade County by the end of July, and the virus was showing up in tests
of sentinel chickens in the Tampa area. It appeared as if 2 major
population centers -- Miami and Tampa -- were in danger. "With the trends
we saw, we definitely were concerned," said Carina Blackmore, acting state
public health veterinarian with the Florida Department of Health. "Most of
our cases earlier in the year were in Miami-Dade, and we really haven't
seen much West Nile there before. With 2.5 million people [in the county],
we were concerned that if we had a lot of infected mosquitoes, we would get
a lot of cases." Then as hurricane season intensified, health officials
worried that the storms would feed a West Nile frenzy, because the
torrential rains would create watery breeding grounds for more mosquitoes.
Health departments handed out free canisters of insect repellent, and the
Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services launched a massive
spraying campaign.
"We sent up our own airplanes, and we contracted with others for any areas
that were hard hit by the hurricanes," said Terence McElroy, a spokesman
for the department. "We just kind of blitzed those areas, in some cases
repeatedly, to make sure there was no significant health risk from the
mosquitoes." The state spent about $11 million spraying 8 million acres of
land in 27 counties. McElroy said almost all of the money is expected to be
reimbursed by the federal government. In the end, however, the successive
hurricanes probably hampered rather than helped the insects. "One of the
theories is that the mosquitoes were depositing eggs but then the next
hurricane would come and flush the larvae out," Blackmore said.
South Florida bore the brunt of the season, with most of the state's cases
concentrated in Miami-Dade, which had 20 of the 41 cases. The others were
sporadic, including 3 residents of Sarasota County who caught the virus
while traveling elsewhere. In Central Florida, only Brevard County had any
confirmed cases, with 4 infections.
West Nile starts in birds, which harbor the virus and pass the infection to
the mosquitoes that feed on them. In turn, the insects can transmit West
Nile to people through subsequent bites. Most infected people never get
sick, however, and the infections go unnoticed. A small percentage will
suffer a milder form of disease called West Nile fever that brings aches,
fever and other flu-like symptoms. In rare cases, the infection can spread
to the brain and cause a potentially deadly swelling called encephalitis.
Many factors influence the severity of West Nile in any given year. As a
result, there are bound to be natural fluctuations from one season to the
next, said John Beier, an epidemiologist at the University of Miami.
Despommier, who studies West Nile and has written a book about the disease,
thinks that temperature and rainfall are the 2 main drivers for the virus.
In places where the infection has been found for decades, such as Israel
and Africa, the worst seasons always have been preceded by drought and a
string of days with temperatures at 90 or above, he said. Birds' normal
feeding patterns are disrupted when water becomes scarce, and the
mosquitoes that typically feast on them are forced to look for new blood
meals. As the temperature rises, the concentration of virus inside the
mosquitoes increases. Laden with heavy doses of virus, the mosquitoes are
more likely to pass West Nile on to their victims. That's why the worst of
this year's season was concentrated in the south west, namely California
and Arizona, where a lack of rain and high temperatures came together. "The
way this disease behaves in this country will be similar to the way it does
everywhere else," Despommier said.
Even birds and other animals were spared a harsh season. This year, birds
and horses tested positive for the virus in 34 out of Florida's 67
counties. Last year, 60 counties had infected animals. But no matter what
happened this year, Blackmore and others warned that all bets are off for
the future. Each season has the potential to erupt in a major outbreak.

Louisiana: West Nile virus back in Lafayette, New Iberia
--------------------------------------------------------
West Nile virus continues to pester Acadiana, with birds in Lafayette and
New Iberia testing positive this week. A blue jay found on Grand Avenue in
Broadmoor subdivision, and a bird in Southport subdivision across from New
Iberia High School, were found this week to have the virus, which is
transmitted from birds to humans by mosquitoes, said Glenn Stokes Sr,
president of Mosquito Control Contractors Inc. "It's unusual for this late
in the year, but people should still take precautions," he said.
Around 1 Dec 2004 Lafayette reported its 1st human case of West Nile virus
in 2004, the 1st case in 2 years, Stokes said. The patient, who is
recovering, is a middle-aged man infected near the intersection of Pinhook
Road and Verot School Road, he said.
