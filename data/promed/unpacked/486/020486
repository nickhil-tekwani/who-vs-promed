In the 1st incident of its kind, a woman university professor from southern Sindh province sent a parcel containing deadly anthrax powder to the Pakistani prime minister's secretariat, police said on Wednesday [1 Feb 2012]. The incident triggered an alarm prompting police and security agencies to launch an investigation.

No one was affected by the anthrax and investigators were yet to determine the motive of the professor from Jamshoro University, officials were quoted as saying by the Pakistani media. It could not immediately be ascertained whether the professor had been arrested.

The parcel was received at the prime minister's secretariat in October last year [2011]. Earlier, police officials in Islamabad had said the parcel was sent to the premier's secretariat about 20 days ago.

Police launched an investigation and registered a case against "unknown persons" after a laboratory confirmed the parcel contained anthrax, they said. The parcel was tested at a laboratory of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research [CSIR]. A police team has been sent to Jamshoro to investigate.

Though the Taliban and other militant groups have carried out scores of bombings and suicide attacks in recent years, there have been no reported instances of them using letters or parcels with poisonous materials like anthrax.

Law enforcement agencies in Pakistan were Wednesday [1 Feb 2011] investigating after a parcel sent to the residence of prime minister Yousaf Raza Gillani was confirmed as containing anthrax.

The parcel was sent last year [2011], but the laboratory test report was received by the Islamabad police only in January [2012]. It confirmed that the suspected powder in the parcel was anthrax. "We were informed about a suspected parcel at the prime minister's house on [18 Oct 2011]. We sent it to the laboratory and got the report only a few days back after which we have launched a formal investigation to see who is behind this," said Naeem Iqbal, the investigator.

"The parcel was posted from Jamshoro in Sindh (the southern province)," he added.

A female university professor sent a packet containing anthrax to the office of Pakistan's prime minister in October 2011, his spokesman says, in an incident that will fuel security concerns in a country that is home to top al-Qaeda leaders and other extremists.

No one was made ill, and her motive was not clear, said Akram Shaheedi, a spokesman for Yousaf Raza Gillani. He said tests at laboratories run by Pakistan's Council for Scientific and Industrial Research [CSIR] in Islamabad had since confirmed the substance in the package was anthrax. Mr Shaheedi said the package was received in October 2011.

He didn't say why he was making the news public now. He also didn't say whether the woman, a professor at Jamshoro University in Sindh province, had been arrested.

Islamist militants and other rebels have carried out scores of attacks against the Pakistani state in recent years, but have not been known to send letters or packages containing toxic material.

[None of the reports above are complete but it seems that the parcel was delivered to the PM's residence on 18 Oct 2011, referred to the CSIR laboratory at some point, and _Bacillus anthracis_ spores identified some time in January 2012. The source, a lady professor at Jamshoro University, has presumably been interviewed but as yet no arrests have been announced. It will be interesting to see how it all works out from such a confusing start. - Mod.MHJ
