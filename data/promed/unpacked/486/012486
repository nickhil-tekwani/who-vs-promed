Since 2003, the United States Department of Agriculture's Wildlife Services
has coordinated a multistate oral rabies vaccination (ORV) program for
wildlife in a 15-state zone extending from Maine to Alabama and in Texas.
The program seeks to enhance local control and prevent the spread of
epizootic rabies among raccoons and, in Texas, among gray foxes and
coyotes, relying largely on reports from persons who find baits and call
telephone numbers printed on them. In August 2009, during the autumn
baiting campaign in western Pennsylvania, a woman aged 35 years who was
taking immunosuppressive medication for inflammatory bowel disease
contacted the Pennsylvania Department of Health (PADOH) after handling a
ruptured bait, which had leaked liquid rabies vaccine onto a patch of
abraded skin on her right hand. The patient subsequently developed vaccinia
virus infection and was treated with human vaccinia immune globulin
intravenous (VIGIV) and an investigational antiviral agent. This report
describes this case, which was the 2nd case of human vaccinia infection
related to the ORV program. Public health agencies should educate the
public, and particularly pet owners, regarding potential hazards associated
with handling wildlife rabies vaccine baits and should provide guidance for
persons exposed to this vaccine.

The ORV program uses an orally delivered animal vaccine, Raboral V-RG
(Merial, Inc, Athens, Georgia) (1). This vaccine consists of a partially
attenuated recombinant vaccinia virus (Copenhagen strain) with a gene
encoding for rabies virus glycoprotein (2). Persons with immunosuppressive
conditions or exfoliative dermatologic conditions are at greater risk for
complications (such as progressive vaccinia or eczema vaccinatum) when
exposed to the vaccinia virus contained in Raboral V-RG vaccine. Currently,
15 states distribute ORV baits for raccoons, and Texas distributes baits
for gray foxes and coyotes. The V-RG vaccine is delivered via a bait made
from a fishmeal block (or a dog food block for coyotes) encasing a sealed
plastic packet contining about 2 mL of vaccine (1). During August-September
2009, ORV bait distribution was conducted in nonresidential areas by
airplane and in rural communities by hand, in parts of western
Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia.

Case report
-----------
In early August 2009, a woman aged 35 years was picking blackberries in a
rural area of Pennsylvania where ORV baits recently had been distributed.
Her dog picked up a bait in his mouth and punctured the bait with his
teeth. After the dog dropped the bait, the woman picked it up, and V-RG
vaccine dripped from the bait onto her right hand and wrist, including
sites that had been abraded by blackberry thorns. About 30 minutes passed
before the woman was able to wash her hands. She telephoned the ORV
helpline number printed on the bait, and her call was referred to PADOH.
The woman had a history of inflammatory bowel disease, for which she was
taking multiple immunosuppressive medications. These medications included a
suppressor of T and B cell proliferation (taken daily) and a tumor necrosis
factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) blocker (taken once every 6 weeks, with the last
dose on 13 Jul 2009); she had no smallpox vaccination scar and reported no
history of smallpox vaccination.

On day one after her exposure to the V-RG vaccine, her physician obtained a
baseline serum specimen for analysis of rabies virus neutralizing antibody
(by direct virus neutralization) and orthopoxirus (vaccinia) immunoglobulin
IgG and immunoglobulin IgM antibodies (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay). In addition, photos were taken of her right hand abrasions, and she
was instructed to watch for signs of infection in her hand. On day 4, she
reported several red papules on her right hand. She visited a local
hospital emergency department, where scrapings of the papules were obtained
and submitted to the PADOH Bureau of Laboratories. The woman was discharged
from the emergency department and advised to stop taking her
immunosuppressant medications.

On day 5, a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay of the
scrapings tested positive for nonvariola Orthopoxvirus DNA. Subsequent
testing performed at CDC confirmed the presence of vaccinia virus DNA and
rabies virus G protein DNA in papule material and serologic evidence of
rabies virus neutralizing antibodies. Neither Orthopoxvirus IgG nor IgM
antibodies were detected.

On day 6, the papules had increased in number and size, and the patient was
hospitalized. Physical examination on admission showed multiple papules on
erythematous bases on the patient's right hand, wrist, and arm, including 3
that appeared to be early vesicles. Because of the patient's immune
suppression and concerns about progressive vaccinia, she was administered a
single dose (6000 IU/kg) of VIGIV (Cangene Corporation, Winnipeg, Canada)
provided by CDC. Contact precautions were utilized while the patient was
hospitalized.

On day 9, she had 26 classic vaccinia virus lesions, including one on a
site on her right arm that might not have been in contact with the vaccine
initially. The patient was afebrile and not experiencing symptoms related
to her inflammatory bowel disease. However, on day 11, she experienced
myalgia and headache; she had pronounced redness and edema in her right
hand, accompanied by right axillary adenopathy. The patient remained
afebrile but was taking an antipyretic pain medication. At that time, her
physician decided that to prevent exacerbation of her inflammatory bowel
disease, the patient soon would need to restart her immunosuppressive
medications. On day 12, in an attempt to reduce viral replication and
prevent progressive vaccinia, a 2nd 6000 IU/kg dose of VIGIV was
administered along with the investigational antiviral agent ST-246 (SIGA
Technologies, Corvalis, Oregon). The ST-246 was administered orally for 14
days after a compassionate use authorization was approved by the Food and
Drug Administration.

On day 13, the patient began receiving phased reintroduction of her
immunosuppressive medications. She was discharged on day 19. By day 28, all
scabs from her lesions had separated and her underlying inflammatory bowel
disease condition was stable. The patient remained Orthopoxvirus IgM
negative throughout her illness.

MMWR editorial note
-------------------
The patient described in this report is only the 2nd person documented with
human vaccinia infection associated with the ORV baiting program and the
1st infected person taking immunosuppressive medications. The one previous
documented human vaccinia infection occurred in September 2000 in a
pregnant woman aged 28 years with eczema who was bitten while pulling a
ruptured bait from her dog's mouth (2). The patient in the current report
was of particular concern for 3 reasons. 1st, she was immunosuppressed from
medications to treat her inflammatory bowel disorder. 2nd, she had fresh
abrasions and prolonged contact with V-RG vaccine (about 30 minutes) before
washing her hands. 3rd, she did not exhibit features of a normal immune
response for a person previously naive for Orthopoxvirus infection (that
is, an IgM antibody response was not detected.) Careful monitoring and
prompt diagnostic evaluation allowed for timely medical interventions, and
the vaccinia virus infection resolved. Although her treatment with 2 doses
of VIGIV and ST-246 might have contributed to her recovery, the role of
these agents is difficult to assess.

Since 1990, about 100 million doses of Raboral V-RG animal vaccine have
been distributed in the US by depositing baits by airplane or by hand in
areas with dense populations of target wildlife species (such as raccoons
in the eastern US). Human or domestic animal contact with ORV baits has
been reported rarely. In 2008, among 16 states where 10 339 969 baits were
placed, 291 vaccine-related telephone calls involving human or domestic
animal contact (2.8 per 100 000 baits) were reported by public health
authorities (3).

The ORV packets containing the V-RG vaccine are durable and typically do
not leak unless punctured. Both documented instances of human vaccinia
virus infections caused by V-RG occurred after baits were found and
punctured by dogs. Humans interacting with domestic animals (typically
dogs, but occasionally cats) that find and eat baits are one of the most
common sources of potential vaccine exposures (4). The Pennsylvania case
described in this report underscores the importance of continuing to alert
the public, particularly pet owners, during baiting season to the
possibility of pets finding and ingesting baits, or carrying them into the
home. Raboral V-RG has been tested for safety in dogs. Owners should not
attempt to remove baits from a dog's mouth. Gloves or plastic bags should
be used to pick up and examine baits if necessary, and additional baits
that might be picked up by dogs or other pets should be removed from the
immediate area. Interviews with all persons who contact the ORV program
helpline printed on the baits can enable early identification of persons at
high risk for vaccinia virus infection. All callers should be asked about
the nature of their contact with the bait and should be counseled to report
any skin lesions. Persons with eye exposure should irrigate the eye with
clean water for 15 minutes and should be referred promptly for an
ophthalmologic examination. In the event of a documented infection, care
should be taken to avoid transmission of the virus to household and other
contacts of the patient (5).

Persons with a history of atopic dermatitis or other active exfoliative
skin conditions and those with immune deficiencies or immunosuppressive
conditions are at greater risk for adverse outcomes (such as eczema
vaccinatum and progressive vaccinia) after infections with non-highly
attenuated variants of vaccinia virus (6), including Raboral V-RG (7).
Health-care practitioners should collect specimens promptly from the
earliest signs of rash and small papules and submit them to an approved
laboratory for testing for vaccinia virus by real-time PCR. Most state
health department laboratories and others participating in the Laboratory
Response Network are equipped to test clinical specimens for the presence
of nonvariola Orthopoxvirus DNA.

[The oral rabies vaccination programme for wildlife uses baits containing
liquid vaccinia-rabies glycoprotein (V-RG) recombinant virus vaccine.
Because contact with ruptured baits can produce vaccinia virus infection in
certain persons, surveillance for human and domestic animal contact with
the baits is essential, The Pennsylvania case described in this report
underscores the importance of continuing to alert the public, particularly
pet owners, during baiting season to the possibility of pets finding and
ingesting baits, or carrying them into the home.

Rather surprisingly, the case described above is only the 2nd recorded case
of human vaccinia infection related to the ORV programme, despite the
distribution in the USA of about 100 million doses of wildlife animal
vaccine since 1990. The particular significance of the 2nd case is that the
person involved was taking immunosuppresive medication.

The original article is supplemented by illustrations showing a fishmeal
block encasing a sealed plastic packet containing the vaccine, and vaccinia
virus lesions with pronounced redness and edema on the right hand of the
patient on day 11 after contact with an animal rabies vaccine bait.

In the longer term, recombinant adenovirus wildlife vaccines may be
inherently safer (see for example: Knowles MK, Nadin-Davis SA, Sheen M,
Rosatte R, Mueller R, Beresford A. Safety studies on an adenovirus
recombinant vaccine for rabies (AdRG1.3-ONRAB) in target and non-target
species. Vaccine 2009 Nov 5; 27(47): 6619-26, Epub 2009 Aug 19. - Mod.CP]
