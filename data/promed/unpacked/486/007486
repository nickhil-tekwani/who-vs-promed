[1] Cholera - Japan
Date: Mon, 21 Feb 2005
From: Mikio Kimura <kimumiki@nih.go.jp>


Under the Japanese Infectious Disease Control Law enacted in Apr 1999,
cases are allocated based on the date of diagnosis, but not that of disease
onset. In the case of cholera, not only symptomatic, laboratory-confirmed
cases, but asymptomatic and suspected cases should also be reported. Thus,
the number of reported cholera cases was 58 in 2000, 50 in 2001, 51 in
2002, and 25 in 2003; however, it rose to 82 cases in 2004.

For 2004, excluding 6 suspected cases, the presumed country of disease
acquisition was Japan in 11 cases, and foreign countries in 65 cases, 33 of
which were the Philippines. When re-allocated by the date of disease onset,
those presumed to have been contracted in the Philippines were clustered
during Jul-Sep 2004. The serotype of isolates from all the Philippine cases
was O1 Ogawa, except for 1 case that was not typed.

A formal outbreak investigation was not carried out; instead, our FETP
[field epidemiology training programme? - Mod.SH] team made inquiries
through the prefecture health departments, especially about the regions of
the Philippines visited and the possible connections between the cases. Our
FETP team also shared the patientsï¿½ information with the Philippine FETP
and the Philippine National Epidemiology Center. Many of the 33 cases
stayed in Manila or the neighboring areas, and some others visited remote
islands. Several cases traveled together: however, most of the cases
traveled independently. Thus, no particular recommendations other than
personal hygiene could be drawn to avoid infection for travelers from
Japan. Since Oct 2004, the number of cholera cases presumed to be of
Philippine origin appears to be at a baseline level.

[2] Cholera - Mozambique (Sofala)

Cholera outbreak confirmed in Sofala
------------------------------------
The health authorities in the central Mozambican province of Sofala
diagnosed (on Mon 21 Feb 2005) 19 new cases of cholera, following a report
of a case of diarrhea in Marromeu district last Wed, 16 Feb 2005, that was
later confirmed as cholera. Provincial chief doctor Flavio Wate, cited in
an issue of the Maputo daily "Noticias", said that 1 case was diagnosed in
Beira, while the others were all reported from Marromeu.

"In Marromeu, the cholera outbreak was notified in the resettlement center
for the victims of floods in the last 2 years, in the locality of Nensa. We
believe that poor supply of drinking water and poor individual and
collective hygiene on the part of some of the residents may lie at the
origin of the outbreak. So far, 18 cases have been diagnosed in Marromeu,
15 of them in Nensa, and the rest in Marromeu town", said Wate.

Schoolteachers in the district have received a 1-day course on cholera
prevention. There were 3 earlier confirmed cases of cholera in Sofala in
2005, 2 in Beira, and 1 in Dondo district.

The Sofala health authorities are also monitoring the districts of Dondo
and Nhamatanda. In the latter district cases of severe diarrhea, which
might prove to be cholera, have been notified.

[3] Cholera, effectiveness of new vaccine - Mozambique
Date: Fri, 25 Feb 2005

Lucas MES, Deen JL, von Seidlein L, et al: Effectiveness of Mass Oral
Cholera Vaccination in Beira, Mozambique. N Engl J Med 2005; 352:757-67.

Background: New-generation, orally administered cholera vaccines offer the
promise of improved control of cholera in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the
high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in many
cholera-affected African populations has raised doubts about the level of
protection possible with vaccination. We evaluated a mass immunization
program with recombinant cholera-toxin B subunit, killed whole-cell
(rBS-WC) oral cholera vaccine in Beira, Mozambique, a city where the
seroprevalence of HIV is 20 to 30 per cent.

Methods: From Dec 2003 to Jan 2004, we undertook mass immunization of
nonpregnant persons at least 2 years of age, using a 2-dose regimen of
rBS-WC vaccine in Esturro, Beira (population 21 818). We then assessed
vaccine protection in a case-control study during an outbreak of El Tor
Ogawa cholera in Beira between Jan and May 2004. To estimate the level of
vaccine protection, antecedent rates of vaccination were compared between
persons with culture-confirmed cholera severe enough to have prompted them
to seek treatment and age- and sex-matched neighborhood controls without
treated diarrhea.

Results: We assessed the effectiveness of the vaccine in 43 persons with
cholera and 172 controls. Receipt of one or more doses of rBS-WC vaccine
was associated with 78 per cent protection (95 per cent confidence
interval, 39 to 92 per cent; P=0.004). The vaccine was equally effective in
children younger than 5 years of age and in older persons. A concurrently
conducted case-control study designed to detect bias compared persons with
treated noncholeraic diarrhea and controls without diarrhea in the same
population and found no protection associated with receipt of the rBS-WC
vaccine.

Conclusions: The rBS-WC vaccine was highly effective against clinically
significant cholera in an urban sub-Saharan African population with a high
prevalence of HIV infection.

[ProMED-mail does not commonly post journal reports, but this report in
this week's New England Journal of Medicine regarding the use of new oral
cholera vaccine in a population with a high prevalence of HIV infection is
particularly noteworthy. This vaccine contains inactivated whole cells of
the classic and El Tor biotypes of _V. cholerae_, serotypes Inaba and
Ogawa, as well as recombinant cholera-toxin B subunit. - Mod.LL]

Cholera kills 46 people in southwestern mining village
------------------------------------------------------
At least 46 people have died in the past 2 weeks as a result of a cholera
outbreak in southwestern Nigeria, a state health official said on Thu, 24
Feb 2005.

All the deaths occurred in the village of Kusa, 50 kilometers from the Oyo
State capital, Ibadan, which is mainly populated by self-employed miners
digging in stone quarries and prospecting for small quantities of gold in
the surrounding hills. "Our record shows 46 people have died of cholera in
Kusa and more than 100 are in hospital," Lekan Kolade, the spokesman for
Oyo state's health ministry, told IRIN. Kolade said the state government
has rushed medical teams to Kusa and surrounding areas.

Outbreaks of the epidemic are common in different parts of Nigeria, as a
majority of the population lack access to clean water. Kolade said the Oyo
State government has pledged to build bore holes in Kusa to alleviate the
water supply problems of the villagers who depend on open wells, streams
and ponds for their drinking water.

[5] Cholera - Congo DR (South Kivu)

Cholera in South Kivu
---------------------
Since 23 Dec 2004, a series of heavy rainstorms has battered the town of
Uvira in South Kivu province of eastern DRC. The most devastating storm was
on 8 Feb 2005, resulting in 8 deaths (6 children and 2 adults) and 3
wounded; 900 houses were either partially or entirely destroyed, resulting
in 5386 people (1095 children and 4291 adults) being left without shelter.
These rains also damaged the 3 main bridges in the area; it is feared that
their weakened state may cause them to collapse, potentially isolating the
entire southern part of South Kivu.

The rains and ensuing flooding have damaged latrines, allowing human fecal
matter to escape; this has exposed the inhabitants to the risk of
water-source contamination and a rapid spreading of cholera. Indeed, this
is already the case in Uvira, as well as Bukavu. As of 30 Jan 2005, a total
of over 2379 cholera cases have been reported, with 23 deaths (1 per cent
mortality). The epidemic is predominantly active in Bukavu and Uvira: from
17-30 Jan 2005, 90 per cent of 582 reported cases were from this province.
The current average in Bukavu is 10 new cases each day; most are coming
from neighboring villages.

There are 3 main causes for this outbreak:
- poor access to potable water, resulting in the population resorting to
drinking water from rivers and lakes; a UNICEF survey (2001) indicated only
17.3 per cent of people with access to potable water within 15 minutes.
- inadequate basic hygiene practices;
- inadequate access to latrines (the same UNICEF survey showed only 40 per
cent of the population with access).

[6] Cholera - Equatorial Guinea (Bioko)
Date: Fri, 25 Feb 2005
From: Irene Lai <iwlai@attglobal.net>


We have received information from reliable sources of an outbreak of
suspected cholera in Equatorial Guinea that began in the 1st week of Feb
2005. More than 400 people with severe diarrhea and dehydration have been
hospitalized in Malabo. At least 2 cases have been confirmed as cholera,
and a number of deaths have occurred. Suspected cases on the mainland in
Bata have been reported too.

On 1 Feb 2005, the State Secretary of Health of Pernambuco confirmed a
report of a case of cholera from the municipality of Sao Bento do Una, in a
rural region of the state. The news report did not give the identity of the
strain of cholera involved.

The program of this congress lists the following paper:
Alessandro Pecego Martins Romano (DF) -- 1st notice of the isolation, since
2001, of toxigenic _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 Ogawa in an outbreak of acute
diarrhea, in Sao Bento de Una, Pernambuco. This is the same strain that was
originally imported to South America in 1991. Cholera serotype El Tor
biotype Ogawa came into Brazil from Peru in 1991, possibly by travelers
along the Amazon.
