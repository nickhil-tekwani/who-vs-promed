[The French Buiatrics Association hosted, during its European
Buiatrics Forum held in Marseilles, France 1-3 Dec 2009, a Satellite
Symposium on the bleeding disorder in calves (popular name: "blood
sweating"). We are looking forward to the proceedings. In the
meantime, the following abstract from the Faculty of Veterinary
Medicine in the University of Liege, Belgium has been received from
Dr Leonard Theron, who presented it in Marseilles. The abstract,
describing one successfully treated case, has been slightly abridged
and edited and is gratefully acknowledged. - Mod.AS]

Since the last 5 years, a specific hemorrhagic syndrome of unknown
etiology was described in young calves. This disease has a low
incidence but a very high mortality rate. No etiology has been found
yet, though many labs have already gathered lots of cases around
Europe: for example, more than 200 cases in 170 farms in Germany; 60
cases in 40 farms were described in Gent's veterinary faculty in
Belgium. In France and in the United Kingdom, several cases have been
recorded in multiple different locations. As far as we know, the
disease concerns young calves aging between 10 and 30 days from
different breeds. Most calves present a purpura on multiple sites on
skin, gums, eye sclera and ears. Hematology indicates severe anemia,
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia with or without leukopenia. Necropsy
indicates multiple hemorrhages in serous membranes on every abdominal
viscera. Alfort's veterinary faculty has described acute necrotizing
hepatitis on one case in France. Those calves are BVDV and BTV
negative both on antigen tests.

In Liege's veterinary faculty, one live case was examined, from a
modern farm with 160 calvings, [where annual calf mortality had been
known to be less than 5 percent]. The farm had 3 hemorrhagic fatal
cases during July 2009 of very quick evolution. From those, 2 were
autopsied and diagnosed BVDV negative.

The 20-days-old calf had hyperthermia in the morning, received
oxytetracycline in the farm and began bleeding at noon. As many of
the described cases, the calf presented mild depression with
hyperthermia and tachypnoea. Skin and ear purpura, gum hematoma,
melena, hematuria and hemoglobinuria were noticed. Hematology
revealed a severe anemia with decreased hematocrit due to a profound
thrombocytopenia (4.79*10^9 /l). Leukocytes formula also shown
neutropenia (0.10*10^9 /l) and a monocytosis (1.32*10^9 /l). It
resulted in a mild leukopenia (3.59*10^9 /l). We also noticed
hypogammaglobulinemia (2.92 g/l and 6.8 percent of total protein).

This calf received an immune-suppressive treatment with a high dose
of dexamethasone (0.64mg/kg), a support dose of levothyroxine
(20ug/kg), oral supplementation of clay and ionic mix, and a cover
antimicrobial therapy for 10 days (Enrofloxacine). A good evolution
of the symptoms on day 2 was observed (all bleeding stopped).
Leukocyte formula had a normal answer to dexamethasone concerning the
lymphocytes and neutrophils population. On day 6, blood formula was
already stabilized, with increasing hematocrite from 12 percent on
day 3 to 15 percent. Thrombocytes count has also increased to
58.20*10^9 /l; leukocytes count was also back to normal with normal
formula. Flow cytometric measures on the lymphocytes subpopulations
indicated a subnormal Gamma-Delta and Natural Killer population, and
a high number of apoptotic cells 12 hours after sampling. This
syndrome can be linked to idiopathic thrombocytopenia in human
newborn both regarding symptomatology and treatment answer.

We did 72 blood samples in 10 farms with cases, [on calves under the
age of 30 days]. Apart from the initial 23 clinical cases, we
identified 4 thrombocytopenic subclinical cases, of which only one
died from the syndrome. The 3 populations (healthy, subclinical,
clinical) are homogenous regarding their hematology, and
statistically different from each other, except for the Neutrophils count.

[We are looking forward to the proceedings of the Marseilles
satellite symposium and to the outcome of the deliberations and
discussions, which may hopefully include a suggested case-definition
and name for the syndrome. It will also be interesting to obtain
other experiences on successfully treated "bleeding calves." - Mod.AS]
