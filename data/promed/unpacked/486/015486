In Israel, only sheep pox (SP) is known to occur; the locally circulating virus strain has not been affecting goats in mixed flocks. Consequently, only sheep are vaccinated. Generally, in affected flocks, morbidity is high while significant mortality is restricted to the offspring, thus seen mainly during lambing seasons. The previous SP event started in February 2017 and was declared resolved in July 2018, affecting 18 flocks throughout the country; a summary and map are available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=22988.

Sheep pox (live attenuated) vaccine was widely applied in Israel until 2012, the (compulsory) vaccination performed by the personnel of the State Veterinary Services (VSAH). Since then the vaccination has been privatized, and since 2016, it is voluntary. The VSAH maintain the power to implement compulsory vaccination in affected regions. In such cases, the vaccination of the entire flock is to be followed by annual vaccination of all animals (sheep) older than 2 months.

For additional details on Israel's SP vaccination policy and vaccines used, see 20161128.4658095. - Mod.AS
