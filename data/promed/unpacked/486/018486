Families planning a memorable wedding for their sons in Madhya Pradesh capital Bhopal will have to shelve the idea of seeing the groom on the horse now.

Reason: The Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) has banned the movement of horses and related class of animals within the municipal limits of the city, to prevent the possibility of spread of contagious glanders disease that was detected recently in a horse in the Kaji Camp-Bafna Colony area.

According to the order issued by the BMC commissioner Priyanka Das, "the order was issued following the receipt of the letter from the Bhopal district collector, which informed about a horse owned by one Rahman in Kaji Camp-Bafna Colony area, being detected to be suffering with the glanders disease.

In line with the notifications and circulars issued by the central government and state government for control of glanders disease as well as other contagious diseases, the BMC commissioner ordered a ban on the movement of horses and related class of animals, their exhibition at fairs and festivals and horse races at sports events with effect from [Fri 4 May 2018] till further orders.

The copies of the BMC commissioner's order have been sent to the district police, regional transport office (RTO), deputy director (animal health services Bhopal), all BMC zonal officers and sanitation officers for compliance.

Glanders is an infectious disease by the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_. It's primarily a disease affecting horses, but can also spread to donkeys, mules, goats, dogs and cats. As per veterinary experts, glanders can even be passed on to humans, through contact with affected animals, particularly from nasal discharge of infected animal.

The ban on movement and show of horses within the municipal limits of the city is bound [to] play spoilsport to the plans of those families who might have booked horses for their grooms to travel to the bride home in imperial style. While 6 marriage muhurats (auspicious days) are slated between [Sat 5 - Sun 13 May 2018], 10 marriage days are there in June, ensued by 9 such auspicious dates in July.

[The following relevant statistics have been included in a locally published media update on [Sun 13 May 2018]: there are, in Bhopal, 30 horse keepers; the total number of horses raised in the city is around 300 and of asses and mules, around 1000. So far, 3 animals have been found glanders-positive. (https://www.patrika.com/bhopal-news/glanders-threat-to-public-1-2791834/).

India and Brazil are known to lead the list of countries where glanders, a zoonotic, OIE-listed equid disease, is endemic. According to the OIE records, the annual, countrywide numbers of reported glanders outbreaks (in equidae) countrywide in India were as follows: 2010 - 1; 2011 - 3; 2012 - 1; 2013 - 1; 2014 - 0; 2015 - 5; 2016 - 22. India's OIE annual report for 2017 is not yet available; during its 1st semester (January-June 2017) a total of 2 outbreaks were reported, one each in Jammu and Kashmir and Uttar Pradesh.

No statistics on the incidence of glanders in humans in India could be obtained.

Glanders is a contagious and fatal disease of horses, donkeys, and mules caused by infection with the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_. The pathogen causes nodules and ulcerations in the upper respiratory tract and lungs. A skin form also occurs, known as "farcy." Control of glanders requires testing of suspect clinical cases, screening of apparently normal equids, and elimination of reactors. _B. mallei_ can be transmitted to humans, but such cases, which were known to be often fatal, have become rather uncommon (see ref. 1). In view of its zoonotic potential, all infected or contaminated (or potentially infected or contaminated) material must be handled in a laboratory with appropriate biosafety and biosecurity controls following a bio-risk analysis.

The above and additional information on glanders, its causative agent, and its diagnosis is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.11_GLANDERS.pdf. A useful updated review on the disease, including its recent global distribution, is available in ref. 1.

No vaccine against this disease is available; however, prior use of _B. mallei_ as a biological weapon and its high mortality in inhalation animal studies has affirmed _B. mallei_ as a biodefense concern. This encouraged, in the past, studies addressing the development of a human vaccine (ref. 2).
