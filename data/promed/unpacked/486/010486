So far this year [2012], 150 cases of pertussis (whooping cough) have been detected in the province of Mendoza, 71 of them confirmed by laboratory. These numbers are substantially higher than the 5 cases registered during the same period last year [2011]. The disease mainly affects children between 6 months and 1 year of age who are not [adequately] immunized, and in some cases can be life threatening.

For this reason, the province's Ministry of Health along with Central Vaccination insist on the importance of vaccination to prevent this disease, especially for pregnant women at 20 weeks of gestation and for children starting at 2 months of age, followed by subsequent doses as indicated by the official vaccination schedule.

"Mendoza is also affected by the pertussis outbreak that exists globally and nationally, which in the epidemiological curve is in the red zone," said the province's head of epidemiology, Adriana Koch.

In view of this situation, it is essential that pregnant women be vaccinated so that their children can develop antibodies through the placenta, because this respiratory disease, caused by the bacterium _Bordetella pertussis_, can be transmitted to infants with no defenses when an adult or older sibling is infected.

The situation is explained in part, because not everyone completes the vaccination schedule properly resulting in the circulation of the bacteria. In addition, immunization wanes after 10 years and revaccination is necessary.

"Whooping cough or pertussis is a respiratory disease very easily transmitted. It is important to note that because neither the natural infection nor the vaccine confer lifelong immunity, several doses of vaccine are required," says Carla Vizzotti, head of the National Program for Control of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases (Pronacei) of the Ministry of Health.

At the same time she noted that "while in adults and adolescents, pertussis is usually not a serious problem, these groups are the source of infection for infants under one year who have a high probability of developing severe complications and even death."

[In the USA, as in Argentina, recommendations on the use of acellular pertussis vaccines have continued to expand in efforts to cocoon susceptible neonates to prevent the substantial morbidity and mortality in infants who have not been yet adequately immunized, like the ones described in this report. The use of the vaccine in pregnant women to provide passive immunity is a further expansion of these recommendations. It is likely, given the limited number of contacts small infants have, that the source for the infant is a family member.

The increasing susceptibility of older children and adults to pertussis, usually manifesting as chronic cough without the typical "whoop," after appropriate primary immunization continues to be increasingly reported. Waning immunity is generally thought to be the cause of the problem, but it is increasingly clear that _Bordetella pertussis_ clones are being selected by the acellular vaccine, against which we are no longer as well protected by the current vaccines. - Mod.LL
