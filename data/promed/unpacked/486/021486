Economical Post-exposure Prophylaxis For Rabies
-----------------------------------------------
The thread on "Rabies, human - Pakistan" [see above has been cut, and left
with a final item containing confusing information on the post-exposure
treatment for rabies. Dissemination of accurate knowledge of the methods
for economical post-exposure prophylaxis for rabies is urgently needed.
The WHO recommends 2 economical INTRADERMAL regimens for post-exposure
rabies prophylaxis:
1) The 8-site regimen
2) The 2-site (Thai Red Cross) regimen
Both of these regimens use a similar total amount of vaccine (< 2 ampoules)
per course, and so the cost should be the same. Confusion arises because
the vaccines are produced in different volumes, 1 ml or 0.5 ml.
The 8-site intradermal (id) method was designed for vaccines of 1
ml/ampoule: i.e., human diploid cell vaccine HDCV (Imovax rabies Aventis
Pasteur); purified chick embryo cell vaccine (PCECV Rabipur/RabAvert,
Chiron Behring) and purified duck embryo vaccine (PDEV Lyssavac-N, Berna).
The other recommended vaccine, purified vero cell vaccine (PVRV Verorab,
Aventis Pasteur), has only 0.5 ml per ampoule and it has not been tested
with the 8-site regimen, but if it were used the logical dose would be 0.05
ml per site, or alternatively 0.1 ml in half the number of sites. (A whole
ampoule of vaccine must be used on day 0 in every case).
The 2-site id regimen was designed for use with PVRV . It requires a dose
of 0.1 ml per site for PVRV and 0.2 ml per site for the other 3 vaccines.
Full details of the economical regimens and practical advice are available
on the WHO website:
<http://www.who.int/emc-documents/rabies/docs/whoemczoo966.pdf>.
The advantages of the 8-site method are a rapid induction of neutralising
antibody, making it the treatment of choice when no rabies immunoglobulin
is available (>95% of post-exposure treatments in the third world); a wide
margin of safety, because if up to half of the 8 id injections on day 0 are
not truly id, the immune response will still be adequate; and using a whole
ampoule on day 0, which avoids the need to share ampoules of vaccine
between patients during the emergency treatment and eliminates any risk of
contamination or wastage of vaccine. Finally, giving a large antigenic
stimulus on day 0 gives the best chance of survival to patients who are
'low responders' to the vaccine and to those who fail to return on time for
subsequent doses, a common problem in the rural tropics.
The complexity of these treatments demonstrates the urgent need for an
improved, single, simplified regimen that is suitable for use with all the
WHO recommended vaccines. Efforts are being made to achieve this goal.
Meanwhile there is reluctance to use these vaccines economically. This
deprives many patients of excellent treatment and perpetuates double
standards of treatment in the third world.
