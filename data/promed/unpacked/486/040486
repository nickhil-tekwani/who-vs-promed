[Recently on the FOODSAFE list, the question of foodborne outbreak
statistics for various countries was raised. This response was received
from Korea. - RAL]
As far as I know, there is no official estimation of foodborne outbreaks
in Korea. I have statistics of reported foodborne outbreaks for the
last ten years from the Ministry of Health and Welfare:
Year Outbreaks Cases Deaths Population
1987 37 548 0 41,622,000
1988 31 1,011 0 42,031,000
1989 40 889 0 42,449,000
1990 32 618 10 42,869,000
1991 42 814 10 43,296,000
1992 44 1,189 5 43,748,000
1993 54 1,136 10 44.195,000
1994 104 1,746 12 44,642,000
1995 55 1,584 0 45.093,000
1996 78 2,676 0 45.545,000
We count those which was involved more than 5 patients from one outbreak.
