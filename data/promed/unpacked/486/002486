Diseases, crops, and countries
------------------------------
The quantity and quality of information available for ProMED-Plant
posts varies considerably within each of these categories. Reports
from affluent countries, on high value crops, and on disease problems
with a currently high profile are disproportionately more frequent.
Therefore, statistics on the number of reports per disease, crop, or
country may be misleading and are not included. Instead, a brief
overview of some of the 2007 plant disease issues is provided below.
Selected highlights for the year (in random order)
--------------------------------------------------
Wheat stem rust strain Ug99 jumped the Red Sea and spread to Yemen.
An even more virulent variant emerged in Kenya. An international
research alliance was formed to screen for resistant germplasm.
Asian soybean rust was first reported in Ghana, the Democratic
Republic of Congo, and Canada, and was found in 4 more states in the
USA than in 2006.
Banana bacterial (_Xanthomonas_) wilt appears out of control in
Africa with a disease focus in Uganda.
Sugarcane smut in Australia has spread to all the major cane growing
areas within 18 months of introduction of the pathogen into the
country.
Rice viruses and their insect vectors were rampant in parts of Asia.
Cocoa black pod and swollen shoot diseases are causing serious crop
losses in West Africa.
Sugarcane orange rust was reported for the 1st time in the Western
hemisphere (USA).
Outbreaks of coffee wilt, leaf rust, and berry disease have affected
crops in Africa.
Grapevine leaf rust has been successfully eradicated in Australia.
_Banana bunchy top virus_ is re-emerging in Hawaii.
Cassava mosaic disease remains a serious threat to food security in
Africa. Resistant germplasm is being distributed to farmers in
affected countries.
Potato late blight causes concern in many countries due to emerging
new strains with increased virulence and multiple fungicide
resistances. A major outbreak has affected crops in India.
A controversy regarding the exclusion of New Zealand pome fruit by
Australia to prevent the introduction of fireblight has been taken to
the World Trade Organisation.
A breakdown of resistance to lethal yellowing (LY) disease was
observed in Malayan Dwarf coconut hybrids. This jeopardises
replanting programmes in LY-affected areas. The mechanism of the
resistance breakdown is unknown.
Citrus canker and greening (huanglongbing) diseases continue to
spread in the USA. Citrus greening was reported for the 1st time from
Pakistan. A citrus canker eradication programme is almost complete in
Australia.
Fungal diseases of vegetable, cereal and root crops, and also
grapevine were of concern in Europe due to warm and humid weather
patterns.
