The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 30 Jul 2019:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 2 701, of which 2607 are confirmed and 94 are probable. In total, there were 1813 deaths (1719 confirmed and 94 probable) and 776 people cured;
- 293 suspected cases under investigation;
- 11 new confirmed cases, including 3 in Vuhovi [North Kivu], 1 in Mandima [Ituri], 1 in Mambasa [Ituri], 1 in Kalunguta [North Kivu] and 1 in Nyiragongo (Goma, [North Kivu]);
- continued search for the confirmed case in the health zone of Lubero [North Kivu] dated 25 Jul 2019;
- 10 new deaths of confirmed cases, including 2 community deaths: -- 1 in Beni [North Kivu] and 1 in Mandima; 6 ETC deaths -- 3 in Beni, 2 in Mabalako and 1 in Butembo; 2 deaths at the CT of Beni;
- 6 new recoveries released from ETCs [in North Kivu] -- 4 Mabalako, 1 in Katwa, and 1 in Butembo;
- 2 live health workers are among the new confirmed cases of Mambasa (non-vaccinated) and Vuhovi (vaccinated). The cumulative number of confirmed/probable cases among health workers is 148 (5% of all confirmed/probable cases), including 41 deaths.

As a reminder, the recommendations of the Ministry of Health are as follows:
1. Follow basic hygiene practices, including regular hand washing with soap and water or ashes.
2. If an acquaintance from an epidemic area comes to visit you and is ill, do not touch him/her and call the North Kivu civil protection hotline directly.
3. If you are identified as an Ebola patient contact, agree to be vaccinated and followed for 21 days.
4. If a person dies because of Ebola, follow the rules for safe and dignified burials. It is simply a funeral method that respects funerary customs and traditions while protecting the family and community from Ebola contamination.
5. For all health professionals: observe the hygiene measures in the health centers and report any patient with symptoms of Ebola (fever, diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, anorexia, bleeding).

If all citizens respect the sanitary measures recommended by the Ministry of Health, it is possible to ensure that this case of Ebola detected in Goma is only a sporadic case that does not cause a new outbreak.

News
Response operations
-------------------
Organization of the Coordination Workshop for the Response to the Ebola Epidemic
- The Technical Secretariat of the Multisectoral EVD Epidemic Response Committee is organizing a coordination workshop from 31 Jul-2 Aug 2019 at the Karibu Hotel in Goma in the province of North Kivu.
- This workshop aims to brief the Technical Secretariat of the Multisectoral Committee by coordinating the response on the organization of the current response in order to enable it to make informed decisions thus avoiding a major disruption of the response.
- It will enable the Technical Secretariat to inquire about the current epidemiological situation of EVD and the main challenges to be addressed, to learn about the current response structure (organization of the different levels of coordination), and the new strategic plan for the response. (SPR4) and synergy with the security, humanitarian, and financial sectors, as well as the operational readiness of DRC neighboring countries to create a favorable environment for the response.
- It will also allow discussion about the challenges and perspectives related to priority themes (pillars). This workshop will result in the priority actions to be carried out over the next 90 days and the overall orientations on the response, as well as the new organizational structure of the response.
- It should be noted that under SPR44, effective and coherent change in strategies, effective coordination, consistent standards, and support for the most vulnerable communities in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri are envisaged, while preventing the spread of the epidemic in other provinces and countries bordering the DRC.

Death of the 2nd confirmed case of Ebola in Goma
------------------------------------------------
- The 2nd confirmed Ebola case from Goma died on Wed 31 Jul 2019 at the ETC Nyiragongo de Goma located in the General Reference Hospital of this city.
- This last case of Goma is a patient who began to present the symptoms of EVD on 22 Jul 2019. On 30 Jul 2019 he went to the Goma General Referral Hospital (GRH) located in the Nyiragongo Health Zone, where he was directly transferred to the ETC for appropriate care.
- Previously, he was treated as an outpatient by a nurse in a private community health center in the Nyiragongo Health Zone.

[Al Jazeera, abridged, edited]
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/07/case-ebola-confirmed-dr-congo-goma-190731062541695.html

The 2nd patient to be diagnosed Ebola in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo's largest city, Goma, has died, according to officials.

Jean-Jacques Muyembe, DRC's Ebola response coordinator, confirmed the death on [Wed 31 Jul 2019], a day after the case was announced.

"A patient who was confirmed with Ebola in Goma has died. Every measure has been taken to block the chain of transmission," said Jean-Jacques Muyembe, in charge of coordinating the fight against the outbreak.

The incident has increased fears the virus could take root in the densely populated city of 2 million, which is more than 350 km [218 mi] south of where the outbreak was first detected. This would accelerate the spread of disease which has killed over 1800 people over the past year and become the 2nd-worst outbreak on record.

Aruna Abedi, in charge of coordinating the Ebola response in North Kivu, the worst-hit province, said the 2nd patient to die from Ebola in Goma had arrived at a treatment centre "11 days after falling ill. His was really a hopeless case, because the illness was already at an advanced stage and he died overnight on [Tue 30 Jul 2019]."

Public health emergency
-----------------------
The man who died was in his 40s, a miner returning home from an area of northeastern Ituri province where no Ebola cases in this outbreak have been recorded, World Health Organization officials told reporters.

He could have been exposed to Ebola anywhere between Komanda in Ituri and Goma, as he took motor taxis over a number of days through the densely populated region at the heart of the outbreak, said Dr Michael Ryan, emergencies chief at WHO.

The man arrived in Goma on 13 Jul 2019 and started showing symptoms on 22 Jul 2019. He was isolated at an Ebola treatment center on Tue 30 Jul 2019. He had spent 5 days being treated at home and then went to a health facility, where Ebola was suspected.

"He may not even have been aware of the exposure that he had," Ryan said, adding that the man's potential contacts were being identified and given an experimental but effective Ebola vaccine.

Symptoms such as fever can be confused with malaria, which is endemic in the region.

Looks like a 3rd #Ebola case in Goma, one of the children of #2, the man who died. I haven't seen anything official but I have no reason to doubt it. If a baby in this family got infected I would expect more cases among the 10 kids. Very sad.]

[In addition to his family, this 2nd case exposed many people to Ebola as he made his way back to Goma. We can only hope that contacts are able to be identified and vaccinated. It is disturbing that no Ebola cases in this outbreak had been recorded in the area of northeastern Ituri province where the miner was working. This is part of the challenge of stopping the spread of the virus, that is, there are unknown chains of infection. - Mod.LK]

Situation update; data as reported by 28 Jul 2019
-------------------------------------------------
The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces in Democratic Republic of the Congo continues. Since our last external situation report, with data reported up to 21 Jul 2019, 79 new confirmed EVD cases with an additional 47 deaths have been reported across the two affected provinces. Sustained transmission continues to occur in Beni Health Zone, which accounts for 61% of the new cases reported in the last 7 days, as well as a number of cases and contacts that travelled to other health zones. The 1 Aug 2019 will mark 1 year since the declaration of the outbreak. WHO continues to adapt and accelerate our response.

With support from an international consortium of partners working on the response, the Ministry of Health of Democratic Republic of the Congo has developed the first pillar of the 4th Strategic Response Plan (SRP4) for the control of the EVD outbreak. The 1st pillar covers the core public health response to the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Other pillars of the plan are being finalized and will be progressively released.

Overall, EVD case incidence rates remained largely unchanged in the past week (Figure 1). In the 21 days between 8--28 Jul 2019, 65 health areas within 17 health zones reported new cases, representing 16% of the 406 affected health areas within North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Table 1 and Figure 2). During this period, a total of 253 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the health zones of Beni (57%, n=145), and Mandima (12%, n=30), which are the main active areas of the outbreak. Most (67%) of the cases reported in Mandima Health Zone came from Some Health Area to the North, and this health area has seeded cases to Mambasa in recent weeks. The response has poor access to this health area due to community resistance, and this leads to more cases. There are currently no confirmed cases of EVD outside of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

As of 28 Jul 2019, a total of 2671 EVD cases, including 2577 confirmed and 94 probable cases, were reported. A total of 1790 deaths were reported (overall case fatality ratio 67%), including 1696 deaths among confirmed cases. Of the 2671 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, 56% (1500) were female, and 28% (758) were children aged less than 18 years. The cumulative number of health workers affected is 146 (5.5% of total cases.)

- Wed 31 Jul 2019. On eve of 1-year mark, WHO calls Ebola in DRC 'relentless'
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease research and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/07/eve-1-year-mark-who-calls-ebola-drc-relentless
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

Employing an effective vaccine, conducting extensive surveillance, and building community trust have all gone a long way in limiting the spread of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). But 1 year after the first cases were identified in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, experts from the World Health Organization (WHO) said today at a press conference that the fight against the virus must continue.

WHO officials called the disease "relentless and devastating."

"This is not a milestone we ever wanted to mark," Matshidiso Moeti, MBBS, the WHO Regional Director for Africa said. "But this outbreak is one with unprecedented challenges." Moeti said one challenge has been ongoing violence: in 1 year, armed rebels and others have launched 198 attacks on healthcare workers and facilities.

A year of violence -- a vaccine of hope
---------------------------------------
Moeti and Mike Ryan, MD, the WHO's executive director of emergency programs, fielded questions from reporters and give an update on the outbreak. Ryan shot down suggestions that the use of the vaccine had led to complacency among both Congolese and the international community, who assumed an easy fix in Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV, which has been used on more than 170 000 people since last August [2018].

"The vaccine has led people in the DRC to have hope, rather than terror during this outbreak," said Ryan. "The vaccine has helped," he said. "But if everyone who doesn't get vaccinated that needs to, then the overall effect of the vaccine is lessened."

Throughout the press conference, Ryan and Moeti both warned that without a continued investment in the DRC's public health infrastructure, Ebola will continue to spread. "The people of Congo have suffered too long; this is a call to look at health systems," Ryan said.

2nd patient in Goma dies, exposure unknown
------------------------------------------
Today [31 Jul 2019], the WHO confirmed that a 2nd case-patient in Goma has died from Ebola infection, and potentially exposed dozens of people in the weeks prior to his death.

"Goma is the DRC's gateway to the rest of the world," said Moetti. "The concern now in the 2nd year of the outbreak is international spread." Goma is on the Rwandan border, and home to an international airport. The city is considered the crossroads to the Eastern part of the DRC, with a population of around 2 million.

Moeti said Goma's 2nd patient was a miner in his 40s who had wide-ranging contact with dozens of people, including his family, members of his church, and transportation drivers in recent weeks. More important, the WHO does not yet have specific information as to where the man contracted the virus.

Ryan said the man could have been exposed anywhere between Komanda and Goma in the last several weeks, as he traveled from a mining area in northeastern Ituri, where he worked, to Goma. He spent 5 days at home in Goma before being transferred to a hospital, and in the last few days, an Ebola treatment center.

"Establishing when he became sick will help us know his potential exposure," Ryan said, assuring that a thorough investigation is under way.

In June [2019] the disease was found in 3 case-patients who traveled between Uganda and the DRC. Ryan said there have been no further cases of Ebola among contacts of those patients, nor have there been any transmission chains identified from Goma's 1st patient -- a pastor from Butembo who was diagnosed earlier this month [July 2019].

'Relentless,' 'devastating' disease
-----------------------------------
According to the WHO's online dashboard, the outbreak total now stands at 2698 cases, which means 11 new cases were identified today. A total of 1811 people have died.

Today [31 Jul 2019], the WHO and the United Nations issued a joint statement on the anniversary of the outbreak.

"In the last year, there have been more than 2600 confirmed cases, including more than 1800 deaths in parts of Ituri and North Kivu provinces," the statement read.

"Almost 1 in 3 'cases' is a child. Every single 'case' is someone who has gone through an unimaginable ordeal. More than 770 have survived. The disease is relentless and devastating."

[MSF (Medecins Sans Frontieres International), abridged, edited]
https://www.msf.org/drc-ebola-outbreak-response-struggling-one-year

As the worst Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo's (DRC) history approaches its 2nd year, the number of new Ebola cases recorded each week is hovering near its highest levels since the beginning of the epidemic.

In July 2019, between 80 and 100 people were diagnosed with the disease every week. The outbreak is also continuing to spread geographically. Uganda saw its 1st Ebola patients in June [2019], though they had travelled from DRC, while Goma, a city of 1.5 million people, recorded its 2nd case just this week [30 Jul2019].

Building trust amidst insecurity
--------------------------------
Insecurity is frequently mentioned as one of the main challenges for the Ebola intervention. Northeastern DRC has been an area of active conflict for the past quarter century and is rife with the presence of armed groups.

Alongside this, healthcare workers associated with the Ebola response are still not trusted. They have been specifically targeted, sometimes resulting in crucial activities such as contact tracing, alert investigation or vaccination campaigns to be suspended, limited or cancelled.

Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) knows this all too well. In February [2019], the Ebola treatment centres in Katwa and Butembo were attacked, forcing us to withdraw our teams from those centres.

Ebola is highly lethal, poorly-understood, and often the subject of conspiracy theories that evoke a sentiment of rejection. As the outbreak is so far concentrated in a region that has long supported the political opposition, intervention from the country's authorities is viewed with suspicion. The cancellation of presidential elections in Beni and Butembo, with the ongoing outbreak cited as the reason, did nothing to ease this tension.

The massive mobilisation of financial and human resources associated with the Ebola response marks a striking contrast to the neglect this region has suffered from over the decades.

MSF's activities in this volatile region predate the Ebola epidemic and we have witnessed and responded to recurring crises linked to widespread violence, endemic malaria, outbreaks of measles or cholera, none of which has generated a similar sense of urgency. This adds to the widespread belief that people's best interests are not at the heart of the Ebola response.

We know that we, the respondents to the epidemic, are still failing to earn people's participation in the response. So far, roughly 1/3 of Ebola-related deaths have been diagnosed only post-mortem, highlighting the high numbers of people who avoid Ebola dedicated facilities.

There is a lot more that must be done to engage constructively with the community to improve the response.

Integrating the Ebola response
------------------------------
Set up as a 'parallel system', Ebola treatment and transit centres are distinctly separate from the healthcare facilities people are familiar with. As a result, they appear shrouded in mystery; seen as places where people go to die, once they've been separated from their families.

The intervention must show more sensitivity for people's concerns, fears and customs in caring for the sick and respecting the dead. We must create conditions conducive to mutual trust and positive collaboration. This is paramount if we are to gain control of the epidemic.

MSF teams are working hard to put patients at the centre of this response, adapting to the needs and expectations of people, including their preferences in terms of provision of healthcare. Patients have to be at the centre of the approach and must be given a choice about the way their health needs are managed.

This begins by acknowledging that Ebola is far from the only, or even the main, concern for many people in this region. In fact, 90 per cent of the patients admitted over the course of the year have tested negative for Ebola and likely suffered another illness.

However, these centres must improve their capacity to provide quality, individualised care during the waiting period for the Ebola tests results. Access to general healthcare is a much broader issue that needs addressing.

What's more, we know that many people experiencing symptoms of Ebola continue to seek healthcare at facilities they are already familiar with first. Yet these facilities have often been weakened by the reallocation of their staff to the Ebola response itself.

This is why we have worked towards an integrated Ebola response, incorporating Ebola-related activities in local health centres and general hospitals, and investing in primary healthcare, triage and isolation, hygiene, and sanitation in these facilities.

This means improving provision of care for other healthcare needs such as trauma, malaria, or measles, and boosting the proximity of these services to the community.

It is hoped that this will foster acceptance of Ebola-related activities by people and encourage the earlier reporting of symptoms and identification of suspect cases. The results are so far encouraging: over the course of July [2019], as many as 10 per cent of the confirmed patients admitted to an Ebola treatment centre in Beni had been referred there from a health centre supported by MSF. This is a higher percentage than that of patients referred from dedicated Ebola transit centres.

The advantage of available vaccines
-----------------------------------
Unlike during the West Africa Ebola outbreak in 2014-16, investigational vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV is much more available now. Over 170 000 people have received the vaccine during this outbreak through a 'ring vaccination' approach, which targets the contacts of confirmed Ebola patients and frontline workers.

However, increasing challenges in tracing and following-up the contacts of confirmed patients means that many people who are eligible to receive the vaccine may not be receiving it.

Furthermore, the stock of this vaccine has been limited and there is speculation about supply shortages, after doses of rVSV-ZEBOV were fractioned in May. This has limited organisations' ability to revise and improve the vaccination strategy, even though expanding the availability of the vaccination around active outbreak areas may have a significant impact in reducing its spread.

For this reason, we need transparency about the actual availability of rVSV-ZEBOV - not just in terms of overall quantities, but also of the timeline of new production, location of storage and destination of the additional doses.

If doubts about its future availability persist, we ask the Congolese authorities to reconsider their opposition to using a 2nd investigational vaccine to contain the outbreak.

As the outbreak enters its 2nd year, MSF will prioritise working closely with communities to provide medical care to those who need it. We will endeavour to break down the barriers of distrust that are contributing both to the propagation of Ebola and to a potentially increased health impact of other diseases.

===

MSF has been active since the declaration of the epidemic, intervening in various areas of the region and on several fronts: patient care, management of suspect cases, infection prevention and control, alert investigation and health promotion. Following the attacks on the Katwa and Butembo Ebola treatment centres in February [2019], our teams have focused on support to the local healthcare facilities, to help provision of access to care in an Ebola context and to facilitate early detection and diagnosis of Ebola cases.

Our teams are currently working to support the local healthcare infrastructure in cities such as Goma, Beni, Lubero, and Kayna in North Kivu and Bunia, Mambasa, and Biakato in Ituri. Support covers activities like primary healthcare, triage, isolation, infection prevention and control, water and sanitation, referrals, and health promotion. We also support a 34-bed treatment centre in Bunia and a small ETC in Goma, while finalising the construction of a larger, 72-bed ETC in the city.

After the death on Wed 31 Jul 2019, of the 2nd confirmed case of Ebola in Goma (North Kivu), Dr Jean-Jacques Muyembe, who heads the technical secretariat of the response to the Ebola virus disease, was reassured about the work which is done.

"We have taken steps to secure the city with respect to transmissions. We are here to prevent this disease from continuing for a 2nd year, " he told Actualite.CD.

He said he understood the exasperation of the population in relation to the duration of this epidemic.

"One year is already too much. Previous epidemics lasted only 3 or 4 months, " he added.

The 1st challenge of his action is to control this epidemic.

"We will do everything possible to ensure that this epidemic is contained, without risk of overflow," he said.

In response to Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus:
The risk of national #Ebola spread is high. The population in Goma, #DRC is highly mobile, so this is an event we have anticipated. This is why we have been doing intensive preparedness work in Goma so that any new case is identified and responded to immediately.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (https://twitter.com/DrTedros):
Over 5000 #HealthWorkers have been vaccinated against #Ebola in Goma, #DRC. Health centres have been provided with training and equipment to improve infection prevention and control. Screenings at border crossings have been reinforced & 24h monitoring implemented at the airport.
