Victorian agronomists are warning canola [oilseed rape] growers that an outbreak of the fungal disease blackleg is the worst they have seen.

Steve Marcroft [Marcroft Grains Pathology] said that a combination of factors had lead to such a significant outbreak. "A run of wet weather has helped. The 2nd factor is that the disease is overcoming resistance. Farmers have been growing primarily group A [see comment below] resistant cultivars and therefore the pathogen has become more virulent against those types. The final factor is that resistance to fungicides is also growing."

He said it would be difficult to tell just how much damage had been done so far. "There's not much growers can do now. Unfortunately there isn't a whole lot we know about it.

"[There is] flower infection [and] the resistance for the normal crown canker doesn't seem to apply. The data we're collecting certainly suggest that the solution will be planning the flowering time of crops."

[Blackleg (also called phoma stem canker or leaf spot) caused by the fungus _Leptosphaeria maculans_ is the most serious disease of oilseed rape (osr) with a possible yield loss of 50 per cent or more. It can also affect other species in the _Brassicaceae_ family (such as cabbages, turnip, some weeds), which may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Symptoms on oilseed rape may include lesions on leaves, stems and pods, with stem cankers leading to premature ripening or collapse (lodging) of the crop. Root infections have also been reported (ProMED-mail post 20010819.1959). Symptomless infections may also occur.

The fungus is seed borne and also spread by wind, splash dispersal, mechanical means (for example on contaminated equipment) and infected crop litter. It may overwinter in stubble, which is therefore often sprayed with fungicides. However, this does not eliminate the risk from remaining underground parts of infected plants. Disease management includes use of clean seed, cultural practices to minimise inoculum and fungicides.

Rape cultivars with different levels of disease resistance are available and are placed into groups according to which resistance genes they carry. However, the pathogen is extremely diverse and new strains evolve frequently, both overcoming host resistances and developing new fungicide resistances. Pathogen adaptation may be counteracted by frequent changing of cultivars and/or mixing fungicides with different modes of action. It is possible that the newly noted flower infections above may also point towards a new pathogen strain with different infection patterns.
