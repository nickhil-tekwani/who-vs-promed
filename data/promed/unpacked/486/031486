POTATO SPINDLE TUBER VIROID, VEGETABLE CROPS - AUSTRALIA: (WESTERN AUSTRALIA)

A Western Australian grower group says foreign seeds could be to
blame for a devastating disease sweeping the Gascoyne.

The _Potato spindle tuber viroid_ has wiped out entire crops in the
north-west community of Carnarvon. Vegetables Western Australia is
worried the disease might be coming into the country with imported
tomato seeds.

Executive officer Jim Turley says the seed industry must act to put
an end to the disease. "The seed companies have to be a lot more
responsible about where they purchase their seed from. They must
research and find out what [plant pathogens] those countries have and
what the diseases are in those countries."

[_Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (PSTVd; type member of genus
_Pospiviroid_) is an important pathogen of solanaceous crops
including potato, tomato and capsicum. It causes spindle tuber (or
"gothic") disease in potato and bunchy top in tomato. Yield losses
can be up to 65 percent in potato and up to 50 percent in tomato.
Many solanaceous ornamental and weed species are also susceptible to PSTVd.

Symptoms in tomatoes include leaf chlorosis and discolouration, leaf
distortion, shortening of internodes and stunting of plants; flower
and fruit initiation stops. In potato, shoots are spindly and may
show distortions and proliferations; plants are stunted, and tubers
are small, elongated, cylindrical, spindle or dumb-bell-shaped, with
prominent eyes evenly distributed over the tuber; sprouting is slower
than in healthy tubers. All varieties of tomato and potato appear to
be susceptible, with no natural resistance to PSTVd available in
either host. However, mild strains causing latent infections in some
host cultivars exist.

PSTVd is seed transmitted at a rate of up to 100 percent, depending
on the host cultivar. It is assumed to have spread among potato
germplasm collections all over the world via infected true seed.
Spread occurs also via infected plants or vegetative plant parts
(potato seed tubers, tomato explants), pollen, mechanical means
(including insect and human activities) and plant-to-plant contact.
Only in the presence of _Potato leafroll virus_, PSTVd can also be
transmitted by an aphid vector (_Myzus persicae_).

Due to the multiple potential transmission routes and the large
number of host species, both epidemiology and control of PSTVd are
complicated. Furthermore, PSTVd is exceptionally stable and can
survive in sap or leaf litter for considerable times. Disease
management relies mainly on removal of infected plants and other
possible sources of inoculum, as well as use of certified PSTVd-free
planting material.

In Australia, several previous outbreaks of PSTVd occurred but were
considered to be successfully eradicated (ProMED-mail post
20030804.1913). As mentioned above, it would be important to identify
the source of this recent outbreak. A similar problem of a suspected
PSTVd incursion via tomato seed has recently also been reported from
the USA (ProMED-mail post 20101117.4174). In both cases, PSTVd
certification schemes appear to have failed. The question arises
whether the infected seed may have a common source, such as an
international supplier, or whether PSTVd is more widespread in
commercial tomato seed than generally thought.
