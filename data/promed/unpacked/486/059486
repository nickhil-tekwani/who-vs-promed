The National Institute of Health (NIH) Islamabad [Mon 17 Jun 2019] notified a fresh polio case from district Bannu [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa] taking the total count of polio cases in district Bannu to 9 [?8], in Bannu division to 14, overall in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to 18, and total of 24 in the country so far during 2019.

Coordinator Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Capt. (R). Kamran Ahmed Afridi in a statement said that wild poliovirus has been isolated from stool sample of a 17-month-old boy, resident of Bachaki Market, UC Jani Khel, Tehsil subdivision Wazir, Bannu district, whose father refused to administer anti polio vaccine as well as essential routine immunization to him.

Afridi said that "such cases emerged time and again to prove the fact that refusing anti-polio vaccine to our children put them and other children in the surroundings at risk of being paralyzed."

Kamran Ahmed Afridi said, "as virus is in circulation in the region therefore it would continue to target unimmunized children."

He appealed to parents and caregivers to save their children from paralysis and ensure administering anti-polio vaccine to their children during special case response campaign launched today [17 Jun 2019] in district Bannu, Laki Marwat, DIKhan, Tank, North Waziristan, South Waziristan, Shangla, Buner, and District Torghar.

[According to the End Polio Pakistan website, the addition of this newly confirmed case brings the national total number of WPV1 associated polio cases in Pakistan to 24, with 8 cases reported from Bannu district and 18 overall in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Tribal Districts) (http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-district-wise-2019).

Unfortunately it is a similar tale, with parental refusal to vaccinate, so the child suffers and the virus keeps finding susceptibles to continue its transmission in the country.

A polio case has surfaced for the 1st time in the last 2 decades in Shangla district after the virus was detected in an 18-month-old boy, who lives in Dedal Kamach area along the bank of the Indus. Dedal Kamach is connected to Buner and Torghar districts and is a border region of Shangla district. According to the district coordinator for the Extended Programme for Immunisation (EPI), Dr Wajid Ali Khan, the case was reported by the locals and was later confirmed by the EPI team.

He said it was the 1st case reported in the district in the last 2 decades. When contacted District Health Officer Dr Mohammad Riaz Khan told Dawn that the child had not been vaccinated in the routine drives and a committee had been formed to probe the matter.

Meanwhile, a jirga (see below) was held at Nawy Kaly Dedal Kamach of Nusrat Khel union council. Local notables from various villages and police officials participated in the jirga.

While addressing the jirga (see below), the elders said that there was no resistance to polio vaccine in the community and every citizen was willing to inoculate his/her child. Despite that, they said, a case had surfaced. Ibadullah Khan, a social activist, also said that they had always cooperated with the EPI staff in the anti-polio vaccination campaigns.

[This case was initially reported on ProMED on 13 Jun 2019 (see Poliomyelitis update (45): Pakistan (KP) 20190613.6519005). It will most likely be posted on the Global Polio Eradication website statistics in the coming week.

According to Wikipedia, "A jirga is a traditional assembly of leaders that make decisions by consensus and according to the teachings of Pashtunwali [code of conduct]. It predates modern-day written or fixed-laws and is conducted to settle disputes among the Pashtun people but to a lesser extent among other nearby groups that have been influenced by Pashtuns. Its primary purpose has been to prevent tribal war. Most jirgas are conducted in Afghanistan but also among the Pashtun tribes in neighboring Pakistan, especially in Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK). In 2017, the Pakistani government was aiming to integrate jirgas into the formal justice system." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jirga). While the elders state they are supporting the EPI efforts, one suspects the rumors that are part of the Pakistan anti vaccine movement continue to circulate resulting in many missed opportunities in areas around the country. The challenge will be to break through these social barriers. - Mod.MPP
