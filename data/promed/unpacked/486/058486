A case of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) was detected this week in a small farm in the commune of Val-de-Ruz (canton of Neuchatel) sheltering a few pigs as pets. The sick animal had to be euthanized.

"This viral illness is highly contagious and sometimes fatal for pigs, but remains harmless to humans. Pork can also be eaten without danger," the Neuchatel cantonal veterinarian said in a press release.

PRRS induces reproductive problems for the animal, with reduced fertility, puny piglets, as well as fever and respiratory symptoms (coughing, sneezing, difficulty breathing). The mode of transmission is mainly carried out by direct contact between pigs, by contaminated material, by artificial insemination, but also by air and wind.

Switzerland has been free from this epizootic except for one outbreak in 2012, due to an importation of contaminated semen. The current introduction of PRRS appears to be due to the illegal importation of pigs from abroad.

Strict measures were immediately put in place to prevent the spread of the virus and to eradicate the disease. Analyses are underway to determine whether other pigs have been infected. On a larger scale, pigsties near the outbreak will be monitored using blood samples.

[Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is characterised by reproductive failure of sows and respiratory problems of piglets and growing pigs. The disease is caused by the PRRS virus (PRRSV), a virus currently classified as a member of the order Nidovirales, family Arteriviridae, genus _Arterivirus_. The primary target cells of the virus are differentiated macrophages of the pig, mainly alveolar but also present in other tissues. Two major antigenically different types of the virus exist: Type 1 (previously described as European - EU) and Type 2 (previously North American - NA). Historically, Type 1 was restricted to Europe and Type 2 to North America; currently they are spread globally.

The virus is primarily transmitted via direct contact but also by contact with faeces, urine, semen, and fomites. The possibility of insect vectors (houseflies and mosquitos) and aerogenic spread for short distances has also been confirmed.

PRRS occurs in most major pig-producing areas throughout the world. The reproductive failure is characterised by infertility, late fetal mummification, abortions, stillbirths, and the birth of weak piglets that often die soon after birth from respiratory disease and secondary infections. Older pigs may demonstrate mild signs of respiratory disease, usually complicated by secondary infections.
