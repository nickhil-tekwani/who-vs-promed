[3] Cholera - Nigeria (Rivers State)

A cholera outbreak may have claimed the lives of some children in Andoni local Government Area. Some of the affected communities include Ngo Ukwa Agana, Okoloile, Ebukuma among others.

Residents blamed the incident on the absence of potable drinking water in the affected communities. Some residents told The Tide that the absence of good drinking water made the communities depend on water which has no official safety approval.

The Tide also learned that the absence of medical personnel at the General Hospital at Ngo has led some residents to patronize private and herbal medical practitioners, adding that some patients squeeze water from bitterleaf to treat vomiting and stooling.

When The Tide visited the local Government Secretariat at Ngo, all the offices were under lock and key as the workers were said to be on holiday, while at the Ngo General Hospital, some nurses were seen battling to save the lives of some children brought by their parents.

[4] Cholera - Syria (Aleppo Governorate)

WHO has been unable to get a desperately needed medical aid convoy through to civilians in the rebel-held part of Aleppo despite a government promise in December 2014 to give it access. "Delays often happen due to operational and/or security reasons but details are not to be shared," WHO spokesman Tarik Jaarevi said in an email on Tue 6 Jan 2015. In a statement this week, the WHO said 240 000 medical treatments from it and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent were being held in a warehouse in the government-held part of the city, Syria's biggest, "for further distribution to the targeted areas, which will begin shortly".

On 22 Dec 2014, the WHO said it had received a promise to be allowed to deliver aid to rebel-held parts of Aleppo, which it planned to transport within the week, and also to the besieged districts of Mouadamiya, in Damascus, and Eastern Ghouta, outside the capital. The non-governmental Union of Syrian Medical Relief Organizations, made up of Syrian doctors, says cholera and other diseases are spreading among the 360 000 people in rebel-held Aleppo for lack of treatments or vaccines. The area is cut off on 3 sides by the Syrian army.
