E. COLI - UK: MUSIC FESTIVAL SPREAD (02)

From: "CDSC - Weinberg, Julius" <JWeinber@phls.co.uk>

The unattributed message [referenced above] was posted on ProMED-mail.
As a result of this posting, and the consequent media interest, it will
now prove difficult for us to carry out a case control study -- as the
hypotheses we would be testing are well known, and as everyone "knows"
the cause of the outbreak. This could have serious consequences if, for
example we were investigating a food stuff, and as a consequence failed
to identify and remove a contaminated product from the market place.
I am an enthusiastic supporter of ProMED-mail and the ideal of open access
to information, however this has to be tempered with responsibility. I
cannot think of any good reason for ProMED-mail promulgating unattributable
posting from countries where there are clearly identifiable persons with
responsibilities in communicable disease surveillance and control.
Furthermore there is no good reason why the individual making the posting
should ask for their name to be withheld, unless they recognised that
making the posting was not in the best interest of those trying to
undertake appropriate public health action.
I hope that ProMED-mail does not see its role as carrying information just
because it is a "good story" that might entertain its subscribers.

---------------------
We are distressed to learn that a public health study may fail as the
result of a notice on ProMED-mail. However, we seriously doubt that we
should bear the blame, for the following reasons. First, we find it hard
to believe there would have been no media interest in the absence of our
posting. Second, in any case that would be aroused as soon as the PHLS
questionnaire was circulated. Third, can anyone show us a news item that
attributes the report to ProMED-mail?
ProMED-mail always posts reports from authorities when they are available.
They just are not usually the first reports we receive. We believe speed
is essential in reporting outbreaks, in order to protect the public health.
If a foodstuff is suspected of being contaminated, which is better: to
leave it on the shelves to be purchased and consumed while an investigation
is ongoing, or to have it reported and recalled immediately, as McDonald's
did in Denmark, even if the product was later exonerated?
The people who write to ProMED-mail and ask for their names to be withheld
do so because they believe a particular outbreak should be reported, even
though reporting it may be against the policy of their employers. It is
really difficult for us at ProMED-mail to see how posting news of what PHLS
admits was an outbreak can be "not in the best interest of those trying to
undertake appropriate public health action." There must be a better way
than having to keep knowledge of an outbreak quiet in order to carry out
effective investigations.
Some outbreak reports make better stories than others, but as is quite
evident to those who follow ProMED-mail, that is not our criterion for
posting.
We would be interested in the views of our subscribers on this topic.
