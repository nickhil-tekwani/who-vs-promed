distinguish this outbreak from another similar, but unrelated outbreak
elsewhere in Brazil. - Mod.MPP]

Santa Catarina identifies locale of contamination of Chagas disease
-----------------------------------------------
The Epidemiologic Surveillance Unit of Santa Catarina has already
identified the main location of contamination of Chagas disease in the
State. According to the agency, 90 percent of the cases had ingested sugar
cane juice at the Kiosk Barracao da Penha 2, between the municipalities of
Navegantes and Pen-ha, on the side of the BR-101 highway by Kilometer 111.

Confirmation was made this past Monday [28 Mar 2005] after investigations
by the agency. The locale was cited by the majority of patients who were
interviewed. According to the director of Surveillance, Luis Antonio Silva,
inspections of the locale certified good hygienic conditions and good
organization of the food. The problem, according to him, is that the locale
stored the sugar cane in open air. The kiosk is functioning normally, but
is prohibited from selling sugar cane juice, as in all establishments in
Santa Catarina.

The proprietor was unavailable to speak with a reporter. An employee said
that he [the proprietor] was traveling to a relative's home and did not
have a cell or other telephone for contact. The Director of Sanitary
Surveillance of the State, Raquel Bittencourt, said that she will await the
conclusion of the case in order to evaluate whether there had been
negligence, and, if so, to punish the establishment. Norms aimed
specifically for the sale of sugar cane juice will take effect on 31 Mar 2005.

The number of confirmed cases [of Chagas disease] in the State has not
changed: there are 30 cases reported as of today [30 Mar 2005]. The
Ministry of Health has an additional case, in Curitiba (PR), 31 cases in
total. 5 persons have died as a result of the disease. There are an
additional 64 suspected cases under investigation. All tests conducted in
the State have been sent to the Central Laboratory where confirmation of
infection (or non-infection) is conducted. Up until now, 1466 tests have
been analyzed. 6 have tested positive and will be sent for verification.

In Joinville, 10 asymptomatic persons have also tested positive in the 1st
round of testing. According to Silva, the immunoassay ELISA (a method of
testing a diagnosis based on a color variation) is necessary to rule out
the presence of the protozoan, but, doesn't always confirm the presence of
the disease. He [Silva] affirmed that the State Agency has already
discounted 42 cases following a 2nd test, hemagglutination (which uses a
fluorescent composition for detection).

According to Adilson Buzzi, Director of Health Surveillance in Joinville,
26 458 persons have registered to take the test in the city. Of these, 529
presented with symptoms consistent with Chagas disease and were given
priority attention. There have already been 21 166 tests conducted in the city.

Wild animals: The Epidemiologic Surveillance Unit of the Ministry of Health
continues to search for the barbeiro [reduviid bug, triatomid] in the
region where the cases have been confirmed, but nothing was found. 5
animals, opossums, wild bats and rodents, have been captured. According to
Mario Steindel, coordinator of the Protozoologic Laboratory of the Santa
Catarina Federal University, they have already been analyzed, and the
results of the tests should be available within 2 weeks. He explained that,
although some of them [the animals] may not be transmitters, the presence
of the protozoan in the animal can indicate the existence of the disease
cycle locally.

[This swift investigation by the Brazil authorities pinpoints the origin of
this outbreak to a single source, which should help much to calm people
living in the area or traveling through Santa Catarina. It also means that
a larger outbreak affecting Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay is probably not
taking place. - Mod.EP]
