In the last few days, the Centre for Zoonoses Control (CCZ) diagnosed more than 3 bats infected by the rabies virus in Foz do Iguaçu, the western region of Paraná state. The records raised the cases to 19 since January 2021, which is the same number recorded in the whole 2019, and close to the maximum of 32 infected bats recorded in 2018.

Bats were spotted all over Foz do Iguaçu. According to Giselli Kurtz, coordinator of the Zoonoses Control Program, they were observed in the following neighborhoods: Centro, Jardim Niterói, Profilurb, Cohapar, Vila C, Jardim Eliza, Vila A, Jardim Lindóia, Jardim Santa Rita, Jardim das Laranjeiras, Jardim Soledade, Alto da Boa Vista, Três Lagoas, e Três Bandeiras.

"Unfortunately, if this situation continues, the annual record of rabies cases will be broken", said Giselli. According to her, people should notify the authorities when a bat is found on the ground, or inside a house, no matter whether the animal is dead or alive. Normal bats, flying at night or perched in a refuge during the day, are not to be suspected as rabid.

"The bats that might be rabid are those showing strange behavior (on the ground, flying indoors, hitting walls, dead)". She also alerted about the risk to humans and domestic animals directly exposed to a rabid bat.

[2] Rio Grande do Sul (livestock): alert

The agriculture and rural development agency of Rio Grande do Sul (SEAPDR) issued a sanitary alert due to livestock rabies, urging farmers to vaccinate or revaccinate their herds. Since January [2021] the Program for Livestock Rabies Control reported 17 rabies foci in 13 localities, and likely transmission in 28 cities.

The alert WAS issued based on the increase in the incidence of vampire bats (_Desmodus rotundus_) attacks in the State, without identification of the refuge of those bats. Common sites used as refuges are tree holes, caves, cracks in rocks, abandoned houses, among others.

According to the Livestock Rabies Control coordinator, Wilson Hoffmeister Júnior, rabies can be controlled preventatively, by vampire bat population control or strategic vaccination of livestock. The recommendation to farmers is that refuges are sought and reported to the authorities, so bats are captured by specialized personnel. These actions are implemented when there are positive cases in livestock or an increase in vampire bat attacks.

Bat capture involves using mist-nets in areas close to the refuge or next to livestock. Once captured, bats are administered a vampiricide glue [an anticoagulant] on their backs and released.

"The alert is important because winter is the period with most cases, as vampire bats are under stress," explains André Witt, of the Livestock Rabies Control Program.

[Rabies viruses circulate in bats in South America as they do in North America. Genetic evidence suggests that rabies is an old disease for bats in the New World. Bats from most of the bat species in North America, when sampled in sufficient numbers, have been found to be infected with the rabies virus. Bat rabies viruses are genetically diverse, exhibiting mutations characteristic to each host bat species. It should be considered, however, that bat rabies can be transmitted to humans and their domestic animals, and the infections are almost always fatal unless treated. Hematophagous bats (vampires) represent an economic threat to the livestock industry because they transmit rabies to domestic animals while feeding on them. Several strains of the rabid virus circulate in the vampire bat _Desmodus rotundus_, which are the source of livestock rabies. Recently, a new vampire bat species was reported to be another potential rabies vector, the hairy-legged vampire bat, _Diphylla ecaudata_. - Mod.PMB
