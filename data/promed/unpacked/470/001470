While anthrax has already spread in many districts of Bangladesh, forcing
the authorities issue a red alert, the government is hoping the disease
will not turn into an epidemic [But read on. - Mod.MHJ].

The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR)
confirmed on Thursday [9 Sep 2010] that 447 people in 8 districts had been
infected with anthrax in the last 3 weeks. IEDCR virologist A S M Alamgir
said treatment facilities had been made available in all affected areas and
claimed more than half the infected people had already been cured.

Health Ministry officials initially said the northern Sirajganj district
had the most number of infected, numbering 207. But they feared the
situation was worse in another northern district, Lalmonirhat, where
doctors suspect 320 people to be infected. [207 + 320 = 527 - Mod.MHJ]

Officials also confirmed the disease spread after villagers consumed
anthrax infected meat sold at low prices. Veterinary officials also
confirmed that half a dozen anthrax-infected cows died in Lalmonirhat. They
said despite vaccinating cows, they were receiving more infection in
people. Officials reported acute vaccine shortage in most of the areas.

However, after visiting several anthrax patients at the Dhaka Medical
College Hospital, health minister A F M Ruhul Haque said there was "no
reason to worry about anthrax. It will not be an epidemic, and its
treatment is fairly easy. All required medicines are available everywhere."

[Sterne vaccine is very efficient, but it only begins to protect vaccinated
animals from 8 days after vaccination. Animals incubating an infection can
still come down within that period. By any reckoning, 447 cases is more
than an outbreak, even by the flexible terminology used by epidemiologists.

Although the government directed livestock department officials to remain
on highest alert to prevent spread of anthrax, the efforts seem to be
dogged down by a lack of proper coordination among different relevant
agencies, and an acute shortage of veterinary inspectors.

Inspection of cattle prior to slaughter is an important way of preventing
spread of the disease among humans. But most of the red meat available on
the country's markets comes from cattle slaughtered at kitchen markets
without inspection. The entire process of authorising slaughter of animals
for consumption lies with either city corporations or municipalities, not
with the livestock department, said officials of the Department of
Livestock Services (DLS).

"We are not authorised to inspect cattle for slaughter," said an official
of the department on condition of anonymity. "Officially, every
municipality or city corporation must assign a veterinary inspector and a
sanitary inspector for certifying each cattle before slaughter," he added.
"We are solely responsible for treatment of animals brought to veterinary
hospitals, and to create mass awareness about animal diseases including the
ones that can be transmitted to humans," said Dr Saiful Islam, district
livestock officer in Sirajganj. "We don't monitor slaughterhouses," he added.

And officials of city corporations and municipalities are saying they are
not adequately staffed and equipped to inspect all cattle before slaughter.

Veterinary Officer of Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) Dr Azmat Ali told The
Daily Star on Monday [6 Sep 2010]: "We have only 2 veterinary inspectors
for 5 DCC-run slaughterhouses. Moreover, the equipment there is
antiquated," he added. He said more than 700 cows, 250 buffaloes, and 5000
goats are slaughtered everyday in the city for consumption. 30 per cent of
those are slaughtered in DCC-run slaughterhouses, while the remaining 70
per cent are slaughtered mostly at butcher shops of kitchen markets. Most
of the cattle in DCC slaughterhouses cannot be checked, Azmat said. And
what happens in other places is anyone's guess.

Secretary of Pabna Municipality Saidur Rahman said it is not possible for
them to check all cattle to be slaughtered across the district due to
inadequate manpower and a lack of cooperation from cattle traders and butchers.

Although the district administration after a meeting with officials of the
district health department, district livestock department and the
municipality on Monday [6 Sep 2010] asked all butchers not to slaughter
cattle without approval from government appointed veterinarians, the
authorities actually do not have enough inspectors to appoint, he said.
Moreover, the government appointed inspectors can only check for visible
symptoms of diseases; no diagnostic test is possible due to lack of proper
equipment and inadequate manpower, he added.

Sirajganj District livestock officer Dr Shafiqul Islam said they, in
collaboration with the district administration, selected a slaughterhouse
in the district headquarters where cattle are examined before slaughter.
But in other places, cattle are slaughtered without inspection.

Kushtia Municipality mayor Anwar Ali said he appointed a veterinarian to
inspect cattle before slaughter. But the veterinarian cannot check all such
cattle in the district. He can only check the ones that are to be
slaughtered at a certain place and time. "Although we have been requesting
the authorities over a long period to increase manpower, to make the
slaughterhouses bigger, and to procure modern equipment, they do not pay
heed to us," said Azmat of DCC.

The government, however, is hoping to start construction of 6 modern
slaughterhouses in the 6 city corporations by the end of this year [2010]
with financial assistance from the Asian Development Bank, said Shawpan
Kumar Shil, a research assistant at the bank. DCC will also get a modern
slaughterhouse at Gabtoli with the capacity of slaughtering 5000 cattle a
day, he added.

A joint secretary of the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock said on
condition of anonymity: "We have drafted a new act for cattle slaughtering,
to end the confusion about jurisdiction. The drafted act is waiting in the
cabinet for final approval. If it is passed, the whole responsibility of
certifying cattle for slaughter will be on livestock officials."

To address the current crisis, all livestock officers were directed to work
in collaboration with city corporations and municipalities, the joint
secretary added. When asked how the collaboration will work, he said: "If
municipality or city corporation slaughterhouse authorities request
veterinarians from the livestock department, they will send them there." He
also said that, so far, there has been no report of anthrax transmission to
humans from any slaughterhouse; humans have so far been infected mostly
through direct contact with infected animals in rural areas.

Meanwhile, every day, cattle are imported through 24 points of the border,
and DLS has no jurisdiction to inspect those animals. But within the next 6
months, however, cattle and fodder inspection centres of DLS will be set up
at 22 of those points, said Director General of DLS Ashraf Ali. "Bangladesh
Rifles now inspect the cattle that are imported through the border," he added.

When asked if any DLS official is assigned to help the border guards in the
task, he answered: "No," adding that BDR checks the animals but cannot
perform any pathological test, since no veterinarian is posted with the guards.

Around 7000 cattle, including cows, buffaloes, and goats, arrive in the
capital's largest cattle market at Gabtoli every day, but so far, only one
veterinary inspector has been assigned to inspect the animals.

Asked whether the number of inspectors at the cattle market is inadequate,
the DLS DG said: "The inspector only checks the temperature of the animals;
he does not perform any pathological test." When asked whether even for
that the number is inadequate, he said: "He has 2 assistants as well."

Dr Azmat of DCC said: "If all the cattle arriving at Gabtoli from different
parts of the country and India are not checked, the chance of anthrax
spreading in the city will remain high. But the livestock and fisheries
joint secretary said the chance of anthrax being transported to Dhaka with
imported animals is very small, since infected cattle die within a day or 2
of the infection, so if an infected cow is imported from India, it will
most probably die before reaching Dhaka.

Three members of a family were suspected to have contracted anthrax in
Charghat upazila in Rajshahi on Thursday [9 Sep 2010].

Dr Azizul Islam, acting residential medical officer (RMO) of Charghat
Upazila Health Complex, said they primarily suspected them of being
infected with anthrax. "However, we released them, prescribing some
medicines," Azizul said. There are no facilities for testing anthrax in the
upazila, the RMO said, adding that the suspects were released without
collecting their blood samples, as they found nothing to be worried about
with their infection.

One of the family members said that he, along with some villagers, bought
meat a week ago, and none but his family members fell sick after consuming
it. Meanwhile, the District Livestock Officer Khairul Alam Mia said: "No
animal was found affected with the disease in the district yet."
