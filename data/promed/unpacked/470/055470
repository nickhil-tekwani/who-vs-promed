Pigeonpea (_Cajanus cajan_), is a grain legume that is a very important
subsistence crop in marginal farming systems adopted by millions of
smallholder farmers in the Indian subcontinent. It is grown for its seed
for human consumption and for income generation by trading surpluses in
local and commercial markets, but is widely used for diverse purposes,
including as animal fodder and for soil conservation.

Sterility mosaic (SMD) is the most damaging disease of pigeonpea endemic in
the Indian subcontinent. It causes yield losses exceeding USD 300 million
per annum in India and Nepal alone. SMD-affected plants show severe
stunting and mosaic symptoms on leaves, with complete or partial cessation
of flowering. The SMD causal agent is spread by the arthropod mite vector
_Aceria cajani_ (Aceria: Eriophyidae).

Cultivating SMD-resistant genotypes is the most viable way to manage this
serious disease of pigeonpea. Progress in developing broad-based
SMD-resistant material has been hindered by the lack of knowledge of the
causal agent, the absence of diagnostic tools, and factors influencing
host-plant resistance.

After 7 decades of research, vital breakthroughs made on the
identification, detection, transmission, and epidemiology of the SMD causal
agent, Pigeonpea sterility mosaic virus (PPSMV), are enabling the
development of broad-based durable resistant pigeonpea cultivars. These
breakthroughs will contribute greatly to sustainable pigeonpea production
and enhance the income and livelihood of poor farmers in the semi-arid
tropics of the Indian subcontinent.

[Pigeonpea is grown on about 5.25 million ha, yielding 3 million tonnes,
and contributes to about 5 percent of total world production of pulses.
About 90 percent of global pigeonpea is grown in India and Nepal, and the
remainder is cultivated in Africa, the Caribbean and Southeast Asia. There
are no reports of SMD from Africa or the Americas. Infection by SMD in
plants less than 45 days old results in 95-100 percent loss, while older
plants suffer losses of 26-97 percent. SMD is the most significant disease
of pigeonpea in India, causing losses over of USD 280 million in 1993.

A previously undescribed virus, Pigeonpea sterility mosaic (PPSMV), shows
properties similar to viruses in the genus Tenuivirus. However, all
tenuiviruses are phloem-limited, are transmitted by _Delphacid_
planthoppers and only infect species in the _Poaceae_, thus ruling out
PPSMV as a tenuivirus. Ultrastructural studies of PPSMV-infected pigeonpea
showed 100-150 nm quasi-spherical-membrane-bound bodies (MBBs) and fibrous
inclusions (FIs). The filamentous VLPs of PPSMV resemble the nucleoprotein
particles of Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), and PPSV VLPs are slightly
larger than those of TSWV. PPSMV shows no serological relationship to Maize
stripe virus tenuivirus or Peanut bud necrosis tospovirus.

PPSMV and High plains virus share some common properties: transmission by
the eriophyid mite _A. cajani_, 4-7 similar-sized MBBs and similar
morphology. Similar MBBs have been detected in plants infected with fig
mosaic, wheat spot mosaic, thistle mosaic and rose rosette, suggesting that
these viruses may constitute a new virus genus.

Disease management of SMD will depend upon identification of broad-based
resistant genotypes. These are relatively rare in the pigeonpea gene pool,
but a related wild species, _C. scarabaeoides_ (Syn.: _C. indicus_) has
high levels of resistance to several pigeonpea biotic constraints. SMD
thrives readily in crops under irrigation or near irrigated fields, and
such crops are at risk of early infection.
