There was a rise in the number of cholera cases reported in May and
early June 2011, particularly around Port-au-Prince and in the
southern peninsula (Grand Anse, Nippes, Sud and Sud-Est) as well as in
Artibonite and Nord. This increase may be due in part to the beginning
of the rainy season and the flooding that hit the capital. Between 2
May 2011 and 12 Jun 2011, a total of 18 182 new cases were notified in
Port-au-Prince, where 90 percent of the 2300 beds in cholera treatment
facilities were occupied. As of 21 Jun 2011, the occupancy rate had
dropped to 72 percent.

On 12 Jun 2011, the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) reported 344 623
cases of cholera and 5397 related deaths (average case fatality rate
1.6 percent) since the beginning of the outbreak in October 2010.

Poor access to clean water and proper sanitation remains the main
challenge in fighting the epidemic. Water-trucking is now down to 20
percent of what it was after the earthquake. According to the Water
and Sanitation Cluster, about 1/3rd of the non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) supporting camps in Port-au-Prince will be
closing down their water-trucking and sewage removal activities over
the next few months because funds are running out. Lack of sanitation
facilities and the maintenance of existing latrines remain critical
problems in the camps. WHO/PAHO supports all cholera treatment
facilities to ensure safe water is available for patients and
sanitation measures are respected.

According to Health Cluster partners, as of 14 Jun 2011 there were 38
cholera treatment centres and 216 cholera treatment units functioning
in Haiti. Most of the facilities are financed by NGOs. While support
continues in Port-au-Prince, many NGOs are scaling down operations in
rural areas and transferring responsibilities to the MoPH, which does
not have sufficient funds to cover health personnel.

[As funds evaporate and rainy season water causing flooding does not,
the epidemic of _V. cholerae_ continues to plague Haiti. The country
had major problems with potable water which was made disastrously
worse by the earthquake.

The current rainy season is further exposing the problems with access
to clean water. - Mod.LL]

The Dominican Medical Association (CMD) yesterday, Wed 29 Jun 2011,
called the country's cholera epidemic out of control, and asked the
Government to be more responsible in dealing with society's ample
segments of poverty.

CMD president Senen Caba also said he doubts the Health Ministry's
claims of a lower infant mortality rate.

He affirmed that there are more than 15 000 cholera cases and dozens
of deaths which haven't been properly reported, citing hospitals in
Santo Domingo, San Pedro (east), San Cristobal, El√≠as Pina and La
Romana as having the most patients.

Caba affirmed that on average the hospitals receive 30 cases per day.
Most of the patients reside in poor barrios in greater Santo Domingo
and several provinces.

The doctors said the evidence the epidemic has gone out of control is
that the Health Ministry has requested meetings with leaders of the
water sector.
