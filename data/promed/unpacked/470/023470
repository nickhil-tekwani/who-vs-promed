Researchers who detected the West Nile virus (WNV) in Pakistan for the 1st time are calling for urgent coordinated surveillance to assess its distribution in the country of the virus known to cause deadly neurological disease.

Spread by mosquitoes, WNV infection is generally asymptomatic. But in about 20% of cases, fever, headache and vomiting develop; less than 1% of these cases lead to potentially fatal neurological complications. The virus causes inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) or inflammation of the tissue that surrounds the brain and spinal cord (meningitis), studies show.

The researchers published their findings online last month [January 2019] in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases. They found samples of the virus after analysing 1070 serum samples drawn from blood donors in the Punjab province from 2016 to 2018. But when they screened 4500 mosquito specimens collected from 2016 to 2017 from 5 selected districts of Punjab province, the samples tested negative for WNV -- suggesting that the virus is circulating via a different route.

Muhammad Saqib, assistant professor at the University of Faisalabad, Pakistan and one of the authors of the study, tells SciDev.Net that while traditionally the mosquito bite is the primary cause of WNV infection, blood transfusion is an important mode of transmission in Pakistan. "Transmission through human blood transfusion poses grave risks," he says.

Saqib and his fellow researchers from Pakistan and China warn that Pakistanis will be increasingly vulnerable to WNV infection unless surveillance, screening and reporting facilities are immediately put in place.

Since the 1990s, WNV infections and related outbreaks of neurological disease have grown to become increasingly serious public health problems. Genetic analyses have identified multiple lineages, but most studies have focused on Lineage 1. This particular lineage 1st emerged in 1999 in New York (USA) and has a propensity to cause neuroinvasive disease.

"Comparison of partial sequences of WNV with a global representation of 23 WNV sequences have revealed that the strains present in Pakistan belong to the WNV Lineage 1," Saqib says. The Pakistani WNV strain sequences grouped into Lineage 1 are the foremost causes of outbreaks in such countries as Australia, India, Russia and the USA, apart from Europe and the Middle East. Also, nucleotide sequences from Pakistani strains are 98% to 99% similar to isolates of mosquito origin from the Xinjiang province of China, the study finds.

Erum Khan, associate professor and head of microbiology at the Aga Khan University, says that the magnitude and distribution of mosquito-borne diseases including WNV remain poorly understood in Pakistan because of the lack of surveillance and reporting system.

Khan said her department is collaborating with the University of Florida's Emerging Pathogens Institute to introduce by mid-year a nationwide WNV surveillance, detection and reporting system. "These efforts aim to map out disease distribution, develop diagnostic and reporting facilities at national and provincial levels and come up with suggestions for the government."

[West Nile virus (WNV) is a single-stranded, enveloped positive-sense RNA flavivirus that is maintained in nature by an enzootic cycle between birds and blood-feeding _Culex_ mosquitoes (family Culicidae). _Culex_ spp. are widely distributed over the world and have been reported to feed on birds, humans, horses, and other mammals. Outbreaks of WNV disease have been reported in Europe, America, Africa, and parts of Asia. Serological evidence in humans and vector competence for WNV in Pakistan has been reported as early as 1982. In recent years, WNV has been identified in horses and humans in Pakistan and its neighboring countries Iran, Afghanistan, and India as a cause of human encephalitic disease. Surveillance studies in these surrounding countries report WNV circulation in several _Culex_ species as well as several wild, migratory, and domestic birds and water fowl [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2018.00020/full].

This 1st systematic regional assessment of WNV prevalence provides evidence to support the circulation of WNV in the EMRO region in human as well as animal/vector populations. These findings highlight the need for continued prevention and control strategies and the collection of epidemiologic data for WNV epidemic status, especially in countries that lack reliable surveillance systems [https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0007081].

The publication mentioned above can be accessed at https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(19)30031-1/pdf.

The reported data indicate that none of the mosquito pools tested positive for WNV, whereas 3 of 1070 human sera samples from asymptomatic blood donors tested positive. Upon sequencing, the WNV strains were determined to come from the WNV Lineage 1. Transmission of WNV via the blood transfusion route poses serious health risks as demonstrated in various studies in Europe. Recipients and blood banks need to be aware of this possibility; whether blood testing should be routinely initiated for WNV detection, along with blood donor screening for hepatitis B and C as well as HIV, would be a key question for public health professionals. - Mod.UBA
