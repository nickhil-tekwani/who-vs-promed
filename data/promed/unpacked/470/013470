--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
We reconstructed the 2016-2017 Zika virus [ZIKV] epidemic in Puerto Rico by using complete genomes to uncover the epidemic's origin, spread, and evolutionary dynamics. Our study revealed that the epidemic was propelled by multiple introductions that spread across the island, intricate evolutionary patterns, and approximately 10 months of cryptic transmission.

[Conclusions]
-------------
Our study revealed the origin and epidemic spread of ZIKV on the island after a period of cryptic transmission undetected by traditional surveillance. Similar cryptic transmission was reported in Brazil and Colombia, where case detection was hindered by the difficulty to capture asymptomatic or mild cases with clinical manifestations that overlap endemic arboviruses and other laboratory testing limitations particular to ZIKV. The dataset we generated in our study presents a relevant contribution to the geotemporal sampling of ZIKV genomes from the region, enabling the study of the evolutionary and epidemic dynamics in the Americas.

The integration of genomic epidemiology to arbovirus surveillance has proven to be central to the ascertainment of disease epidemiology, uncovering information otherwise concealed by the nature of the disease and limitations of surveillance systems. Fundamentally, integrated proactive genomic surveillance may help us to predict virus emergence and mitigate more effectively their regional or global expansion.

[Inadequate case reporting, especially when virus infections are asymptomatic or mild, has been a serious epidemiological challenge. The authors of the report above have presented an approach to deal with that problem. They also present evidence of multiple introductions of the virus into the island that likely otherwise would not have been detected. - Mod.TY

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Objective
To describe the neurological and neurodevelopmental outcomes of children with congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) associated microcephaly beyond 2 years of age.

Method
We followed children with CZS-associated microcephaly in an outpatient clinic in Salvador, Brazil. Neurological and neurodevelopmental assessments were performed using the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE) and Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Neurodevelopment (Bayley-III) respectively.

Results
Of the 42 children included, 19 were male (45.2%); median (interquartile range) age at neurological evaluation was 28 (25-32) months, and 36 (85.7%) had severe microcephaly. HINE and Bayley-III results were completed for 35/42 (83.3%) and 33/42 (78.5%) children respectively. Bayley-III identified a severe developmental delay in 32/33 (97.0%) children while 1/33 (3.0%) had only a mild delay. In the multivariable analysis, we found that Bayley-III and HINE scores were correlated. Better HINE scores were associated with higher Bayley-III cognitive raw scores (β = 0.29; CI 95% = 0.02-0.57) and motor raw scores (β = 0.43; CI 95% = 0.04-0.82) after adjusting for head circumference, prematurity, and age at neurodevelopmental evaluation. Furthermore, we found that greater head circumference at follow up was associated with higher cognitive (β = 1.27; CI 95% = 0.01-2.53) and motor raw scores (β = 2.03; CI 95% = 0.25-3.81).

Conclusion
Children with CZS-associated microcephaly demonstrate severe neurodevelopmental delays and slower growth rates than their peers over time. Still, they have remarkably heterogeneous neurodevelopmental profiles according to neurological exam scores which correlate with their long-term outcomes. We found that HINE scores effectively captured the heterogeneity of neurological capabilities among these children and could be predictive of cognitive and motor development progress.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Zika virus (ZIKV) is an _Aedes_-mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes debilitating congenital and developmental disorders. Improved understanding of ZIKV pathogenesis could assist efforts to fill the therapeutic and vaccine gap. We use several ZIKV strains, including a pair differing by a single phenylalanine-to-leucine substitution (M-F37L) in the membrane (M) protein, coupled with unbiased genomics to demarcate the border between attenuated and pathogenic infection. We identify infection-induced metabolic dysregulation as a minimal set of host alterations that differentiates attenuated from pathogenic ZIKV strains. Glycolytic rewiring results in impaired oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial dysfunction that trigger inflammation and apoptosis in pathogenic but not attenuated ZIKV strains. Critically, pyruvate supplementation prevents cell death, in vitro, and rescues fetal development in ZIKV-infected dams. Our findings thus demonstrate dysregulated metabolism as an underpinning of ZIKV pathogenicity and raise the potential of pyruvate supplementation in expectant women as prophylaxis against congenital Zika syndrome.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
The ability of viruses to evade the host antiviral immune system determines their level of replication fitness, species specificity, and pathogenic potential. Flaviviruses rely on the subversion of innate immune barriers, including the type I and type III interferon (IFN) antiviral systems. Zika virus infection induces the degradation of STAT2, an essential component of the IFN-stimulated gene transcription factor ISGF3. The mechanisms that lead to STAT2 degradation by Zika virus are poorly understood, but it is known to be mediated by the viral NS5 protein that binds to STAT2 and targets it for proteasome-mediated destruction. To better understand how NS5 engages and degrades STAT2, functional analysis of the protein interactions that lead to Zika virus and NS5-dependent STAT2 proteolysis were investigated. Data implicate the STAT2 coiled-coil domain as necessary and sufficient for NS5 interaction and proteasome degradation after Zika virus infection. Molecular dissection reveals that the first 2 alpha-helices of the STAT2 coiled-coil domain contain a specific targeting region for IFN antagonism. These functional interactions provide a more complete understanding of the essential protein-protein interactions needed for Zika virus evasion of the host antiviral response and identify new targets for antiviral therapeutic approaches.

Importance
Zika virus infection can cause mild fever, rash, and muscle pain and in rare cases can lead to brain or nervous system diseases, including Guillain-Barré syndrome. Infections in pregnant women can increase the risk of miscarriage or serious birth defects, including brain anomalies and microcephaly. There are no drugs or vaccines for Zika disease. Zika virus is known to break down the host antiviral immune response, and this research project reveals how the virus suppresses interferon signaling and may reveal therapeutic vulnerabilities.

[It has been known that Zika virus suppresses interferon, a host defense against the virus. However, the mechanism by which that suppression occurs has not been understood. The above report provides an understanding of that mechanism. It will be interesting to see if these findings can lead to therapeutics that can block the suppression. - Mod.TY

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
What is already known about this topic?
Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause serious brain and eye birth defects.
What is added by this report?
This study describes the frequency of individual Zika-associated birth defects from the US. Zika Pregnancy and Infant Registry (USZPIR). Approximately 5% of infants in USZPIR had any Zika-associated brain or eye defect. Several individual brain and eye defects were more commonly reported. One 3rd of infants with any Zika-associated birth defect had more than one defect reported.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Certain brain and eye defects in infants might prompt suspicion of prenatal Zika virus infection and might provide a signal to the reemergence of Zika virus, particularly in geographic regions without ongoing comprehensive Zika virus surveillance.

[The brain and eye defects from in utero Zika virus infection in these USA cases are similar to those seen during the Zika virus outbreak in Brazil. The implications noted above should be heeded. Travel histories of pregnant women from Zika virus endemic countries coming into countries in which Zika virus is not occurring such as the USA, especially women with fetuses with teratogenic effects, are critical for Zika virus infection inclusion in the rule out list. - Mod.TY]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background
Prenatal exposure to Zika virus has potential teratogenic effects, with a wide spectrum of the clinical presentation referred to as congenital Zika syndrome. Data on survival among children with congenital Zika syndrome are limited.

Methods
In this population-based cohort study, we used linked, routinely collected data in Brazil, from January 2015 through December 2018, to estimate mortality among live-born children with congenital Zika syndrome as compared with those without the syndrome. Kaplan-Meier curves and survival models were assessed with adjustment for confounding and with stratification according to gestational age, birth weight, and status of being small for gestational age.

Results
A total of 11 481 215 live-born children were followed to 36 months of age. The mortality rate was 52.6 deaths (95% confidence interval [CI], 47.6 to 58.0) per 1000 person-years among live-born children with congenital Zika syndrome, as compared with 5.6 deaths (95% CI, 5.6 to 5.7) per 1000 person-years among those without the syndrome. The mortality rate ratio among live-born children with congenital Zika syndrome, as compared with those without the syndrome, was 11.3 (95% CI, 10.2 to 12.4). Among infants born before 32 weeks of gestation or with a birth weight of less than 1500 g, the risks of death were similar regardless of congenital Zika syndrome status. Among infants born at term, those with congenital Zika syndrome were 14.3 times (95% CI, 12.4 to 16.4) as likely to die as those without the syndrome (mortality rate, 38.4 vs. 2.7 deaths per 1000 person-years). Among infants with a birth weight of 2500 g or greater, those with congenital Zika syndrome were 12.9 times (95% CI, 10.9 to 15.3) as likely to die as those without the syndrome (mortality rate, 32.6 vs. 2.5 deaths per 1000 person-years). The burden of congenital anomalies, diseases of the nervous system, and infectious diseases as recorded causes of deaths were higher among live-born children with congenital Zika syndrome than among those without the syndrome.

Conclusions
The risk of death was higher among live-born children with congenital Zika syndrome than among those without the syndrome and persisted throughout the first 3 years of life. (Funded by the Ministry of Health of Brazil and others.)
