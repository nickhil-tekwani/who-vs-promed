Update: Investigations of West Nile Virus Infections in Recipients of Organ
Transplantation and Blood Transfusion --- Michigan, 2002
----------------------------------
CDC, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Health Resources and
Services Administration (HRSA), and state and local health departments
continue to investigate West Nile virus (WNV) infections in recipients of
organ transplantation and blood transfusion. This report summarizes two
investigations of Michigan recipients of blood products, one of whom also
received a liver transplant (1). Both persons tested positive for WNV
infection after receiving blood products derived from a single blood
donation subsequently found to have evidence of WNV. These investigations
provide further evidence that WNV is transmitted through blood transfusion.

On August 14, 2002, a man aged 47 years received a liver transplant and 24
units of blood products (9 units of fresh frozen plasma [FFP], 5 units of
red blood cells [RBC], and 10 units of platelet concentrate [PC]). On
August 20 and 21, he received 15 units of PC. After being discharged from
the hospital on August 24, he was readmitted 10 days later with fever; he
subsequently developed encephalopathy. A lumbar puncture revealed elevated
protein, a lymphocytic pleocytosis, and WNV IgM antibody; the patient
recovered and was discharged. Retention segments* were available for 20
donors; one retention segment was positive for WNV by kinetic quantitative
PCR assay (TaqMan®), and the remaining 19 were negative.

On September 2, a woman aged 40 years delivered a healthy infant. The same
day, she received one unit of RBC, and on September 3, she received another
unit of RBC. She was discharged on September 4. She had intermittent
nausea, malaise, and fever, and was readmitted to the hospital 13 days
after discharge. On September 18, the patient had a fever of 102.8o F
(39.3o C). A lumbar puncture revealed mildly elevated protein, a
lymphocytic pleocytosis, and WNV IgM antibody. Blood center records
indicated that the RBC unit transfused on September 3 was derived from the
same donation subsequently found to be polymerase chain reaction-positive
as the PC received by the liver transplant recipient on August 20. On the
day of delivery, the patient began breastfeeding. A sample of breast milk
obtained 16 days later tested positive for WNV by TaqMan® and for
WNV-specific IgM antibody. The patient recovered and was discharged. The
infant was breastfed during September 2--19 and remains healthy.

Editorial Note:

This report describes 2 patients who tested positive for WNV infection
after receipt of blood products from a single donation. The retention
segment from the donation was positive for WNV by TaqMan®. Although it is
possible that both persons became infected from mosquito bites, these
findings indicate that the patients became infected through transfusion of
blood products. An ongoing investigation in Mississippi isolated WNV in
FFP. The retention segment from the donation from which this FFP was made
was positive for WNV by TaqMan®, and the donor developed WNV specific IgM
antibody after donation. The ongoing investigation provides additional
evidence that WNV can be transmitted through blood transfusion (1).
Additional case investigations conducted by CDC, FDA, and health
departments will help to define the risk for WNV transmission through blood
transfusion and organ transplantation. Because of the risk for WNV
transmission through blood transfusion, efforts to develop a blood
screening test are under way.

WNV RNA has not been identified previously in breast milk, and no studies
are known that define the implications of this laboratory finding.
Laboratory investigations, including attempts to culture WNV from
additional breast milk samples, are under way. Until live virus is cultured
from breast milk, or until definitive data are obtained to document WNV
transmission through breast milk, the TaqMan® findings described in this
report should be interpreted with caution.

The risk for transmission of WNV from mother to infant through
breastfeeding is unknown. The infant described in this report remains
healthy despite breastfeeding for 17 days. Until follow-up testing on the
infant is completed, it is unknown whether the infant was infected with
WNV. The health benefits of breastfeeding are well established (2), and
these findings do not suggest a change in breastfeeding recommendations.

[Investigations into the possibility of transmission of West Nile virus
through transfusion of blood products continues. With high numbers of
asymptomatic infections, screening for possible WNV infection in blood
donors by use of history of illness or possible exposure will not ensure
that a potential donor is not infected. Hence there is a need for a
screening test that can be used. Checking the American Associate of Blood
Banks' website, there is discussion re: doing post donation clinical
followup to attempt to identify those donors who may have donated during
the incubation period.
<http://www.aabb.org/Pressroom/In_the_News/new9-20.htm> Before panic
ensues, subscribers should be reminded that there have been a handful of
case reports (approximately 10-14) of probable transfusion associated WNV
transmission whereas an estimated 4.5 million people receive blood products
in the USA during the course of a year. - Mod.MPP]
