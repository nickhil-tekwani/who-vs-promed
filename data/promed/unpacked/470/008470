[1] WHO Situation Report

A yellow fever outbreak was detected in Luanda, Angola late in December 2015. The 1st cases were confirmed by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) in South Africa on 19 Jan 2016 and by the Institut Pasteur Dakar (IP-D) on 20 Jan 2016. Subsequently, a rapid increase in the number of cases has been observed.

[There is a table showing Geographical distribution and confirmed, probable and suspected yellow fever cases and deaths in Angola and Democratic Republic of the Congo.]

Emergency Committee regarding yellow fever
Following the advice of the Emergency Committee (EC) convened on 19 May 2016, WHO Director-General decided that urban yellow fever outbreaks in Angola and DRC are serious public health events which warrant intensified national action and enhanced international support. The events do not at this time constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).

Summary:
Angola: 3137 suspected cases
In Angola the total number of notified cases has increased since early 2016. As of 15 Jun [2016] a total of 3137 cases have been reported, of which 847 are confirmed. The total number of reported deaths is 345, of which 112 deaths reported among confirmed cases. Suspected cases have been reported in all provinces, and confirmed cases have been reported in 16 of 18 provinces and 78 of 121 reporting districts.

Mass vaccination campaigns 1st began in Luanda and have now expanded to cover most of the other affected parts of the country, recently the campaigns have focused on border areas. Despite extensive vaccination efforts circulation of the virus persists.

Democratic Republic of the Congo: 1044 suspected cases
As of 15 Jun 2016, 1044 suspected (71 deaths) and 61 laboratory confirmed cases have been reported in 22 health zones in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Of these 61 confirmed cases: 53 were imported from Angola, 2 are sylvatic and 6 are autochthonous cases.

Surveillance efforts have increased and vaccination campaigns in DRC have centred on affected zones in Kinshasa and Kongo Central.

The risk of spread
Three countries already have reported confirmed yellow fever cases imported from Angola: DRC (53 cases), Kenya (2 cases) and People's Republic of China (11 cases). This highlights the risk of international spread through non-immunised travellers.

Seven countries (Brazil, Chad, Colombia, Ethiopia, Ghana, Peru and Uganda) are currently reporting yellow fever outbreaks or sporadic cases not linked to the Angolan outbreak.

Risk assessment
The outbreak in Angola remains of high concern due to:

- Persistent local transmission in Luanda despite the fact that approximately 8 million people have been vaccinated.

- Local transmission has been reported in 12 highly populated provinces including Luanda. Zaire and Huambo are the provinces that most recently reported local yellow fever transmission

- The continued extension of the outbreak to new provinces and new districts.

- High risk of spread to neighbouring countries. As the borders are porous with substantial cross border social and economic activities, further transmission cannot be excluded. Viraemic travelling patients pose a risk for the establishment of local transmission especially in countries where adequate vectors and susceptible human populations are present.

- Risk of establishment of local transmission in other provinces where no autochthonous cases are reported.

- High index of suspicion of ongoing transmission in hard-to-reach areas like Cabinda.

- Inadequate surveillance system capable of identifying new foci or areas of cases emerging.

[Although the ongoing transmission in Angola is worrisome, the sharp increase in suspected cases in the Congo DR over the past few days is of serious concern. It will be important to confirm (or discard) these cases and determine if the positive ones are imported from Angola or are locally acquired.

[2] Vaccine dose extension

Independent experts have recommended using 1/5th of the standard dose of yellow fever vaccine in the event of a global shortage to combat the worst outbreak in decades, the World Health Organization (WHO) said Friday [17 Jun2016].

"Experts agreed to propose if necessary, if there is a shortage of vaccine, to divide the vaccine by 5. 1/5th of a dose according to their evidence would be sufficient to provide immunity for at least 12 months," WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said, reporting on a meeting this week.

The global stockpile of yellow fever vaccines, which has been depleted twice this year to immunize people in Angola, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo against the deadly mosquito-borne disease, currently stands at 6 million doses, WHO said in a statement.

[In recent weeks there has been considerable concern about vaccine availability, particularly for Angola and the Congo DR. Certainly, administration of 1/5 the usual dose significantly expands the number of individuals who can be covered, and is far better than running out. The challenge will be deciding when the time has come to start reducing dosage volume. - Mod.TY]
