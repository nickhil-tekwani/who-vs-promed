Spice farmers peppered with disease, bad weather and prices
-----------------------------------------------------------
High rainfall and diseases have left pepper farmers from a rural
commune in the central province of Quang Tri on the verge of
bankruptcy after more than half of the plants died or contracted
diseases. Quang Tri has been one of the leading provinces nationwide
in producing black pepper with 1800 hectares [4448 acres] devoted to
it.

The provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has
reported that unpredictable weather and increasing occurrence of
pests and diseases recently have destroyed many of the plants.
Productivity has been 70 percent less than in previous years. Many
farmers are unable to pay bank loans after pepper vines have died on
a large scale.

The head of the Plant Protection Agency in Cam Lo District, Pham Da,
says the pepper area at Cam Thanh Commune has suffered because of
fungus infection and improper drainage. The plant's roots have rotted
during the recent monsoon season because farmers hadn't drained away
the rainwater in time, he says. Da also says the district authorities
have held workshops in an effort to help farmers recover the
remaining area of pepper, and support them in buying anti-fungus
sprays.

Viet Nam is one of the world's leading countries in producing and
exporting pepper.

[Black pepper (_Piper nigrum_) is known to be affected by several
fungal diseases, including quick wilt (foot rot; _Phytophthora
capsici_), leaf rot (blight; _Thanatephorus cucumeris_), basal wilt
(_Athelia rolfsii_) and anthracnose (fungal pollu; _Glomerella
cingulata_). While quick wilt includes root rot symptoms and has been
reported to affect black pepper in Viet Nam before, it is soilborne
and can therefore not be managed by fungicide applications alone, as
is suggested in this report. However, it is not certain that quick
wilt is the problem described above.
