No symptoms of bird flu have been found, says doctor
----------------------------------------------------
The Central Animal Health Directorate has confirmed that the deaths of
chickens at the Battar Poultry Farm at Battar Bazaar, Bidur Municipality
were not due to the bird flu virus. According to program director of the
directorate Dr Dhanaraj Ratala, no symptoms [sic.] of bird flu have been
found in the dead chickens during a test carried out by the directorate.
They could have died due to Newcastle virus.
Meanwhile, a team led by senior veterinarian Dr Dev Raj Adhikari of the
directorate visited Battar and inspected the poultry farms in the area. The
team also carried out tests on the dead chickens and brought chickens of
the farm to Kathmandu for further examination and tests.
Some 600 out of 1000 chickens at the Battar Poultry Farm died over a period
of 3 days, which prompted the authorities to conduct an investigation on
the matter. The District Livestock Office has stated that more than 60 000
chickens are currently being raised in Nuwakot District.
