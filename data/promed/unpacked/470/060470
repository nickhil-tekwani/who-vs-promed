Despite not being able to chew her food, Koko is still trying to eat. The 8-year-old mare at Integrity's Haven Equine Rescue Centre Society in Chester Basin, NS, bites into the hay but can't hold it in her mouth. Even so, the centre's owner, [AW], said Koko's attempts to eat are a promising sign.

"If she's going to fight, I'm going to fight for her," the owner said.

Koko was diagnosed with botulism last week. Two other horses at the centre -- Freedom, 29, and Dakota, 12, -- died from the sickness on Wednesday [20 Jun 2018] and Friday [22 Jun 2018], respectively. The horses became ill after eating contaminated hay, the owner said. After learning of the source, she got rid of all the hay on the farm on Friday [22 Jun 2018] and replaced it.

"[Koko] is still here when they expected her to be gone. All I can do is pray and hope," the owner said. "Right now, she can't swallow on her own. It's a muscular and a nerve disease, and her tongue will not swallow food, so that's where I come in. I'm giving her IV fluids."

The centre takes in old horses, sick horses, and healthy horses in need of a home.

According to the American Association of Equine Practitioners, equine botulism is a "progressive, paralyzing disease that is 80-100 percent fatal in affected horses." The disease is not contagious, but it can be contracted by eating food contaminated by a toxin produced by the bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_.

Dr. Megan Crouse, an equine veterinarian at South Shore Veterinary Hospital in Wileville, NS, said she sees cases of equine botulism pop up every year or 2. "It's not uncommon, but it's not something we see every day," Crouse said.

The association notes that not too many horse owners are aware of the disease. Signs can often look like colic, which is what the owner initially thought was the problem.

[AW] said she was surprised to learn the illness was likely caused by contaminated hay. She said she had previously thought botulism was a risk only when feeding silage and hayage, which contain more moisture than hay when harvested.

"For all those people out there who thought, like me, if you feed dry hay you're safe, you're not," [AW] said.

Crouse said botulism is a potential risk in all hay. "It's definitely something that can happen in any hay," she said. "It's more commonly seen in improperly packaged or preserved hayage or silage, which is what we see it most commonly in, but it can also be if an animal carcass or body has been baled up in dry hay as well."

[AW] watched her horse Freedom die from the disease. She said it was a violent death. She said a veterinarian in PEI [Prince Edward Island] who had prior experience with botulism in the US made the diagnosis.

She will need to keep an eye on all the other horses for signs until 2 Jul 2018 to ensure they're not sick. Koko and Dakota were given an antidote.

14 other horses received a charcoal placebo. [AW] said if any of her other horses start to show signs, she would try to get the antidote, which she said cost CAD 1500 [USD 1128] per dose.

There is a vaccination for botulism, but [AW] said she was told by a vet 2 years ago -- when Nova Scotia was facing a hay shortage and [AW] was planning to feed her horses haylage -- that it would be too expensive to get shots for all her horses.

On Friday [22 Jun 2018], the owner learned the vaccination is about CAD 45 [USD 34]. Each horse would need 3 rounds of shots in the first 3 months and then once a year.

"I'm not laying blame, because I should have said how much is too much," [AW] said. "When [the vet] said it, I was thinking hundreds of dollars per horse."

The owner said she now has about CAD 15 000 [USD 11 276] in vet bills. Her friend started a fundraising page to help pay the bills.

"45 dollars a shot could have saved my Freedom, my Dakota, and now I have Koko dying on me," she said. [Actually, it would have been about CAD 150 [USD 113], as each shot is CAD 45 [USD 34], [and there must be a series of 3 given initially. - Mod.TG].

The owner said she's learned a valuable lesson too late. "I'm mad. They're my kids, they're my children. This could have been so easily prevented," she said.

[This is a very sad story. We certainly feel for them and the tragedy they have been going through. Hopefully, some good can come of this, such as raising awareness of this disease to other animal owners, as it can occur in horses, cattle, llamas, etc. consuming tainted hay or haylage.

_Clostridium botulinum_ produces several different toxins. Type A toxins are often implicated in human infant botulism. Types B, C, and D toxins are usually involved in cases of equine botulism, with type B responsible for 85 percent of horse cases (at least in the USA). - Mod.TG]

Horses of any age are susceptible to botulism, which may be initiated by 1 of 3 ways. In the case of "forage poisoning," the horse ingests toxins that are contaminating feedstuffs such as grain or hay. Feed contamination is most often due to putrefied carcasses of birds or rodents. Unfortunately, carcasses of other animals such as cats, rabbits, skunks, and others can become baled into the hay.

Botulism through a feed source, such as hay, can also affect other animals, such as cattle.

The bacteria can also enter a horse's body via contamination of a wound, especially a deep puncture wound. A good example is "shaker foal syndrome" which is most frequently caused by the bacteria entering the newborn foal's body through the foal's moist navel -- something that can be minimized by dipping the foal's navel in mild iodine solution soon after birth. The 3rd method in which the disease can be initiated is by ingestion of the spores in the soil. The ingested spores activate in the horse's intestinal tract, where they produce potent toxins that are then absorbed. Regardless of the route, once the bacteria have entered the horse's body, they produce toxins that block transmission of nerve impulses to the horse's muscles. This results in a progressive paralysis of all the major muscle groups and is concluded with paralysis of the diaphragm, which results in death. Once symptoms develop, death may ensue in several hours or take up to a week.

The disease is difficult to diagnose because it resembles several other medical conditions and diseases such as choke, colic, rabies, EPM (equine protozoal myeloencephalitis), and sleeping sickness. Blood samples very rarely contain toxin, and necropsy following the death of the horse usually does not provide a conclusive diagnosis. Because the bacteria often occur naturally in the horse's intestinal tract, isolation of the organism from the sick horse's intestine is not diagnostic.

Botulism is usually fatal if left untreated. Prior to the advent of antitoxin, the death rate among affected foals was greater than 90 percent. With the use of antitoxins in conjunction with antibiotics and supportive therapy, the mortality rate can be reduced to less than 25 percent. Animals unable to swallow should be fed through a nasogastric tube and placed on IV fluids. Once the toxin produced by the bacteria is attached to the nerve ending, it cannot be neutralized by the antitoxin. Therefore, early treatment is critical. Even with aggressive therapy, recovery is slow and may require up to 2 weeks before the affected horse recovers.

Because of the high death rate and the difficulty in diagnosing this disease, prevention through vaccination is critical. A type B toxoid vaccine is available and is quite effective in preventing the disease. In areas where the disease is prevalent, pregnant mares should be initially vaccinated at the 8th, 9th, and 10th month of gestation and thereafter at the 10th month of each pregnancy. Yearly vaccination of adults in areas where the disease frequently occurs is also recommended. If unable to vaccinate the mare prior to foaling, limited information suggests foals vaccinated with the toxoid at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks of age developed adequate protection, even in the presence of passive maternal antibodies. Currently, no licensed vaccines are available for preventing botulism due to _Cl. botulinum_ types A or C or other subtypes of toxins. Cross-protection between subtypes does not occur.

Clinical signs of the disease in adult horses suffering from "forage poisoning" initially include loss of facial expression, a sleepy appearance, saliva drooling from the corner of the mouth, loss of tongue control, and loss of tail tone. The horse's appetite is good, but it has a great deal of difficulty in chewing food and appears to be "playing" in its feed and water buckets. As muscular weakness becomes more profound, the horse will experience muscle trembling, generalized sweating, and labored breathing. A weakened, shuffling gait may develop, and the horse may take stiff, short steps as if walking on eggs. Eventually, the horse goes down, and death results due to paralysis of the respiratory muscles. Shaker foal syndrome is usually seen in foals 1 to 2 months of age but can develop as early as 2 weeks or as late as 8 months of age. Early signs in foals are similar to those seen in adults: generalized weakness, poor tail tone, and loss of tongue control. The foal will often dribble milk from the mouth and nostrils because of an inability to swallow. Because of muscle weakness, the foal will lie down frequently. When it does rise, it soon develops muscle tremors and collapses. Affected foals may die within 12 hours of exhibiting symptoms or may linger for as long as a week.
