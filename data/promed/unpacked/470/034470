[Aqmola region borders, on its north, the region of north Kazakhstan where highly pathogenic avian influenza [HPAI] H5 has been identified in poultry and wild birds, reported to the OIE on 19 Sep 2020. Though the above media report does not include details of the causative agent, it may be assumed that the disease has spread southwards, caused by the same HPAI H5 strain (yet to be fully serotyped) circulating in North Kazakhstan.

Kazakhstan's self-declared freedom of HPAI, published by the OIE on 9 Dec 2018, has been withdrawn as of 11 Sep 2020; see 'Kazakhstan' in OIE's table of self-declarations at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/Self-declarations/Archives/ENG_archive_2000_September_2020.pdf. - Mod.AS
