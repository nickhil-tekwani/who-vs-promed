Korean Health Institute Activates Watch for Vibrio Vulnificus
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SEOUL -- Korea's National Institute of Health (NIH) today activated a
_Vibrio vulnificus_ watch nationwide, the NIH said Tuesday. The national
health organization said it has discovered _Vibrio vulnificus_ bacilli in
sea water, turban shells, and in the aquariums of raw fish restaurants on
Gangwha Island near Incheon, Yeonggwang, South Jeolla Province and Daejeon.
The disease breaks out from June to October every year mainly in waters off
the south and west coasts. Those in ill health, particularly diabetics and
alcoholics, are susceptible if they eat raw fish or shellfish. The disease
can also be passed through cuts on the hands when people handle uncooked
fish. The epidemic causes high fever, diarrhea and vomiting after an
incubation period of 1-2 days and can even lead to various skin diseases.
An NIH source said the mortality rate from the disease is 40-50 percent,
suggesting that people should eat [only] cooked fish and shellfish because
the germ dies when it is exposed to temperatures over 56 degrees centigrade.
