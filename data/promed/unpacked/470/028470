Figures from the Office for National Statistics show [that] the
numbers of deaths linked to the hospital bug _Clostridium difficile_
have soared in England and Wales. Between 2005 and 2006, the number
of death certificates which mentioned the infection rose by 72
percent to 6480, most of which were elderly people. In over half of
cases, it was listed as the underlying cause of death. It is thought
that some of the increase may be due to more complete reporting on
death certificates. Deaths involving _C. difficile_ increased by 77
percent in men and 66 percent in women between 2005 and 2006. Rates
in both sexes have gone up dramatically since 2001, when there were
only 1200 mentions of the infection on death certificates.

The ONS figures also showed deaths involving MRSA remained roughly
the same between 2005 and 2006, at around 1650.

_C. difficile_ usually affects the elderly and can prove fatal if
antibiotic treatment fails to kill all the spores in the gut and they
take hold again before the patient's own gut bacteria have had chance
to mount a resistance. It is also very difficult to eradicate from
the ward environment, which means it is easy for other patients to
become infected.

Professor Brian Duerden, chief microbiologist at the Department of
Health, said in July 2005, they called for more accurate reporting of
infections such as MRSA and _C. difficile_ on death certificates.
"These statistics from 2006 show that this move has worked, and our
figures are now in line with other developed countries. Since 2006,
we have taken significant steps to tackle infections. These include
stringent hand-washing guidance for the NHS, a bare below the elbows
dress code, putting matrons back in charge of cleanliness on their
wards and an ongoing deep clean of every ward." And, he added
hospital infection rates were now falling. The Health Protection
Agency reported in November 2007 that rates of _C. difficile_
infection may be leveling off, with the number of new cases down 7
percent to 13 660, while MRSA cases are falling.

Liberal Democrat health spokesman Norman Lamb said: "These figures
beg the question of why it took so long for the government to realise
the seriousness of deadly infections such as _C. difficile_. Recent
successes in keeping infection rates down are [due] to the hard work
of NHS staff, who are up against enormous pressure to hit targets
while keeping their wards infection-free."

Shadow health secretary, Andrew Lansley, said: "Almost 3 times as
many people are now killed by hospital infections as are killed on
the roads each year. The overall scale of infection is unacceptable
and the need for a comprehensive infection control strategy,
including improved antibiotic prescribing and access to isolation
facilities, hand hygiene and cleanliness is paramount." He added: "An
expert told the Department of Health last week that it was the
government's failure to implement guidelines since as far back as
1994 that has contributed to the recent rise."

[Presumably, the increased mortality attributable to _C. difficile_
is due at least in part to the recent emergence of the new,
hypervirulent _C. difficile_ strain ribotype 027 in England and
Wales. From a prior ProMED post Clostridium difficile, ribotype 027 -
UK: (N. Ireland) 20080207.0498:

"_Clostridium difficile_ is the most common cause of bacterial
diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis in hospitalized patients, and
antimicrobial drug therapy is the most important risk factor
associated with the acquisition of _C. difficile_. Recent outbreaks
of _C. difficile_-associated diarrhea with increased severity, high
relapse rate, and significant mortality, have been related to the
emergence of a new, hypervirulent _C. difficile_ strain in North
America, Japan, and Europe. The emerging strain, which hyper-produces
toxins A and B, is referred to as North American pulsed-field type 1
and polymerase chain reaction [PCR] ribotype 027. These epidemic
strains are characteristically resistant to fluoroquinolones, the use
of which is one risk factor for disease due to this ribotype (Drudy
D, Kyne L, O'Mahony R, Fanning S: gyrA mutations in
fluoroquinolone-resistant _Clostridium difficile_ PCR-027. Emerg
Infect Dis 2007; 13. Available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/13/3/504.htm>).

A surveillance program for _C. difficile_, which covered all the
English health regions in 2006, determined that 26 percent of
isolates were ribotype 027.

Preventing the spread of _C. difficile_ in healthcare facilities
involves clinical and microbiologic surveillance of hospitalized
patients with diarrhea for _C. difficile_ and heightened infection
control measures, including prompt patient isolation of patients with
_C. difficile_-positive diarrhea or cohorting, where isolation rooms
are not available, combined with particular emphasis on hand hygiene
and control of the inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents
(<http://www.shea-online.org/Assets/files/position_papers/Cldiff95.PDF>).
