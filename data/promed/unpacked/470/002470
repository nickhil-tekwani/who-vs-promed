A 51-year-old resident of Hanoi's Tay Ho district has died from septic shock after being infected with _Streptococcus suis_ in Hanoi. His death was confirmed on [9 Sep 2012] after 2 days of treatment at the Hanoi-based National Hospital of Tropical Diseases. He was reported to be in a coma and haemorrhaging under his skin after eating raw pig's blood soup.

_Streptococcus suis_ is a gram-positive coccus that can cause pneumonia, meningitis, septicaemia, and arthritis in pigs. It can transmit to humans through close or direct contact with infected pigs and pork products.

[Human _Streptococcus suis_ infection is a potentially fatal zoonosis that has been reported to cause most commonly meningitis, but also toxic shock if the strain produces the appropriate toxins, and less commonly bacteremia, pneumonia, septic arthritis, and endocarditis.

Human _S. suis_ infection occurs mainly among those who slaughter infected pigs. Eating appropriately cooked meat or organs from infected pigs is said to pose no risk of _S. suis_ infection. However, people who eat raw infected pork and cooks who prepare food from infected pork meat and organs would also be at risk of infection. Person-to-person spread does not seem to occur (see http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/50/2/201).

_S. suis_ has been isolated from asymptomatic pigs; but virulent strains can cause serious disease mainly in suckling pigs (polyarthritis, meningitis, and septicemia) and in recently weaned and growing pigs (meningitis). In addition, _S. suis_ sometimes causes pneumonia, endocarditis, myocarditis, or abortions in adult pigs.

The viral infection, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) in pigs is known to have an immunosuppressive effect, which is thought to increase pigs' susceptibility to infection with _S. suis_.
