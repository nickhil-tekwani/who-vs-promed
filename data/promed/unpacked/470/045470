RIFT VALLEY FEVER - SAUDI ARABIA (JIZAN)(04): SUSPECTED

Concerning Rift Valley fever - Saudi Arabia (Jizan)(03), it might be
useful to clarify a couple of things for ProMED-mail readers:
1. In the newspaper article, it is said that RVF "occasionally"
infects humans but has a high mortality when it does. In fact, human
infections are quite frequent. Humans are usually symptomatic but
infrequently severely ill. When hemorrhagic fever occurs, it does
have a high case fatality. The overall mortality from RVF is not
known with precision, but may be around one percent.
2. Human infection does occur after "close contact with contaminated
animal tissue," but, it is worth emphasizing that freshly shed blood,
and freshly dead animals, are the risk. It is generally believed that
meat from carcasses inactivates RVFV through post-mortem
acidification.
These are not major issues, but, for the average reader, it would be
good to keep things clear. We are all looking forward to knowing
whether these are IgM antibodies and whether there are virus
isolations. Recognition of transmission of RVF depends strongly on
good surveillance and laboratory testing.

[Dr. Peters's authoritative comments are highly valued. His
observation, emphasizing that freshly shed blood and freshly dead
animals are the risk, falls in line with our remark regarding
exposure of humans to blood aerosols during slaughter.
C.J. Peters has been, for deca
des, one of the world's leading RVF experts. On top of his important
contribution to the research of the pathogenesis of RVF, he was engaged in
the investigations of several outbreaks, beginning with the Egyptian one in
the late 70's, which he closely followed. We join him in anticipating early
information about the detailed results obtained in the Saudi surveillance in
animals. This will allow confirmation -- or otherwise -- of current
suspicions. - Mod.AS].
