Probable Locally Acquired Mosquito-Transmitted Plasmodium vivax
Infection - Georgia, 1996:
Endemic, mosquito-borne transmission of malaria was interrupted in the
United States during the 1940s. Since then, 57 small localized outbreaks
of probable mosquito-transmitted malaria in the United States have been
reported to CDC.
This report summarizes the investigation of a case of
_Plasmodium vivax_ infection in a resident of Georgia who had never lived
in or visited a malarious area. The results of this investigation
suggest that this case probably was acquired through the bite of a
locally infected _Anopheles_ sp. mosquito, although a probable source of
infection for mosquitoes was not confirmed.
