The Venezuelan public health authorities have confirmed that there
have now been 124 cumulative cases of influenza A/H1N1 virus
infection. Dr. Eugenia Sader, the Venezuelan Minister of Health,
reported that there are 25 cases of type A influenza in the Capital
District, and she confirmed that the government has enough vaccine
available to contain this outbreak.

She emphasized that they are not implementing a mass vaccination
campaign. "The vaccine is indicated for persons at risk: children,
pregnant women, the elderly (more than 60 years old), and persons with
any underlying chronic disease (hypertension, heart disease or
cancer)," she added.

[It is presumed that the virus responsible for this outbreak is the
influenza H1N1 2009 strain rather than the previous seasonal H1N1
strain, which has virtually disappeared elsewhere in the world.
Venezuela does not feature in the most recent FluNet report (see:
Influenza (21): WHO update 20110314.0819). - Mod.CP]
