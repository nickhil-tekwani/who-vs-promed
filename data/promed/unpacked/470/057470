Two men from the Copenhagen area have been diagnosed with
leptospirosis, one of whom, a 62-year-old man, has died. The infection
has probably occurred through contact with sewer water in cleanup of
flooded basements.

After a heavy rainfall in Copenhagen on 2 Jul 2011, Statens Serum
Institut became aware of 2 cases of leptospirosis or Weil's disease
among men living in the Copenhagen area. In both cases these are
people who have cleaned up the basement after rain. For cleanup, these
people probably came into contact with sewer water that was
contaminated with rat urine, which may contain the bacteria that cause
leptospirosis.

Leptospirosis is a rare disease caused by infection with bacteria of
the genus _Leptospira_. These bacteria are found in many animals, but
in Denmark it is usually bacteria from rats that cause the disease.
Infected animals excrete the bacteria in large numbers in the urine.
Transmission to humans occurs either through direct contact with urine
from infected animals or indirectly, through contact with freshwater
that has been contaminated with infected urine.

In connection with clearing and cleaning the basement, where there is
standing water after a flood, it is important to protect yourself by
using personal protective equipment, such as boots and rubber gloves.
After work is completed, a bath should be taken, dry thoroughly with a
clean towel, and put on clean clothes.

The clothes you have worn during cleanup work should be placed in the
washing machine and washed at as high a temperature as possible --
preferably above 80 deg C [176 deg F]. Alternatively, discard clothing
in a sealed black plastic bag and disposed of as ordinary waste.

The initial symptoms of leptospirosis are non-specific. There can be
high fever, headache, muscle pain (especially calves and lower back)
and bloodshot eyes. In severe cases (Weil's disease), failure of vital
organs, particularly the liver, kidney, and the coagulation system
occurs. The lungs are also affected in severe cases. The disease can
be treated with penicillin or other antibiotics. The best effect is
achieved if treatment is started within the 1st 4 days of illness. In
severe cases, the mortality rate is 5-15 percent.

Leptospirosis occurs worldwide and cases are described in every
country. However, Denmark has no more than 5-10 cases in a year and
these cases are usually linked to occupational (rural)/recreational
exposure. No cases in Denmark have occurred following urban exposure.

Because many offices and houses in Denmark have been under water for
a prolonged time after a heavy rainfall on 2 Jul 2011 and the risk of
under-diagnosis (because it is not a common disease and the initial
symptoms are non-specific), this could become a (local) public health
problem.

I only have experience with rural outbreaks, but I guess these
situations have been described already (maybe in the southern
hemisphere mostly). The fatal case reported by the media was
misdiagnosed, as initial symptoms are very non-specific. And what
about carriers among pets now? It would be great to have any
comment/assessment if somebody from the network has some experience.
Active surveillance is ongoing now.

[As pointed out by Dr Mantero, leptospirosis is usually an
occupational disease in people who work outdoors or with animals, for
example, workers in wet agricultural settings (such as rice field
workers), ranchers, slaughterhouse workers, trappers, loggers, sewer
workers, veterinarians, fishery workers, dairy farmers, or military
personnel. Also leptospirosis is a risk during recreational
activities, such as camping, fresh water swimming, canoeing, kayaking,
rafting, golfing, and trail biking, that involve exposure to water in
lakes, rivers, or ponds contaminated by urine from leptospire-infected
animals, as well as household exposure to infected pet animals or
rodents (http://www.cdc.gov/leptospirosis/exposure/index.html).

However, leptospirosis has also been reported in urban settings in
the absence of recognized occupational or recreational exposure, for
example, in the USA (Vinetz JM, Glass GE, Flexner CE, Mueller P:
Sporadic urban leptospirosis. Ann Intern Med. 1996; 125(10): 794-8;
http://www.annals.org/content/125/10/794.full.pdf+html) and in Japan
(Koizumi N, Muto M, Tanikawa T, et al: Human leptospirosis cases and
the prevalence of rats harbouring _Leptospira interrogans_ in urban
areas of Tokyo, Japan. J Med Microbiol 2009; 58(Pt 9): 1227-30;
http://jmm.sgmjournals.org/content/58/9/1227.long). These urban
cases were presumably acquired by exposure to infected rat urine or
contact with urine of infected dogs (Wong ML, Kaplan S, Dunkle LM, et
al: Leptospirosis: a childhood disease. J Pediat 1977; 90(4): 532-7;
abstract at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/557083). The US CDC
notes that the incidence of leptospirosis among urban children appears
to be increasing
(http://www.cdc.gov/leptospirosis/exposure/index.html).

Leptospirosis is also a hazard in urban settings following exposure
to contaminated floodwater after heavy rainfalls (See ProMED-mail

Leptospirosis - Philippines: 20110715.2143).
