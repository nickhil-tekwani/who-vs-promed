Tyson Foods Inc., a Dexter, Missouri, establishment, is recalling approximately 8 492 832 pounds of ready-to-eat (RTE) chicken products that may be adulterated with _Listeria monocytogenes_, the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today [Sat 3 Jul 2021].

The frozen, fully cooked chicken products were produced between 26 Dec 2020 and 13 Apr 2021. The products that are subject to recall are listed here: https://www.fsis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media_file/2021-07/Tyson%27s%20Product%20List%20Final.pdf. View the labels here: https://www.fsis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/media_file/2021-07/recall-023-2021-labels.pdf.

The products subject to recall bear establishment number "EST. P-7089" on the product bag or inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped nationwide to retailers and institutions, including hospitals, nursing facilities, restaurants, schools, and Department of Defense locations.

On 9 Jun 2021, FSIS was notified of 2 persons ill with listeriosis. Working in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state public health partners, FSIS determined there is evidence linking the _Listeria monocytogenes_ illnesses to precooked chicken produced at Tyson Foods Inc. The epidemiologic investigation identified 3 listeriosis illnesses [2 in Texas and one in Delaware], including one death [in Texas], between 6 Apr 2021 and 5 Jun 2021. During routine sample collection, FSIS collected 2 precooked chicken samples from 2 establishments that are closely related genetically to _Listeria monocytogenes_ from ill people. One of the samples was collected at Tyson Foods Inc. FSIS is continuing to work with federal and state public health partners to determine if there are additional illnesses linked to these products.

Additional information on the investigation may be found on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/precooked-chicken-07-21/index.html).

Consumption of food contaminated with _L. monocytogenes_ can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions, sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery, or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections [can occur] in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within 2 months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health-care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumer and institutional freezers. Consumers should not eat these products. Institutions should not serve these products. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

Members of the media who have questions regarding the recall can contact Derek Burleson, Communications Manager, Tyson Foods, at (479) 290-6466 or <derek.burleson@tyson.com>. Consumers who have questions can contact Tyson Foods customer relations at (855) 382-3101.

Consumers can also browse food safety messages at Ask USDA (https://ask.usda.gov/s/) or send a question via email to <MPHotline@usda.gov>.

[The recalled products were frozen, fully cooked, ready-to-eat (that is, requires no further cooking) chicken produced between December 2020 and April 2021, the department said. The products include chicken strips, chicken pizza, and pulled chicken breasts that were sold under brand names including Tyson, Jet's Pizza, and Casey's General Store (https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/04/business/tyson-chicken-recall.html). The US Department of Agriculture urged people to throw away or return the recalled chicken.

Due to the long incubation period of listeriosis (up to 70 days), further outbreak cases may yet be reported. - Mod.ML
