Newcastle disease outbreak suspected
------------------------------------
The discovery of about a 1000 dead birds in north west Saskatchewan has the
province thinking it's an outbreak of the Newcastle disease virus (NDV).

Birds found in the Meadow Lake and Jackfish Lake areas are being tested for
the disease. Double-crested cormorants and gulls were found to have lesions
consistent with NDV.

The Ministry of Environment says there are occasional outbreaks that happen
naturally, but they are short-lived and kill limited numbers.

NDV doesn't pose a large health risk for people, but in rare cases people
in contact with many infected birds have contracted eye irritation or flu
like symptoms for about a week.

The province says anyone who comes across dead cormorants or gulls
shouldn't touch or pick up the birds, and should report them to the nearest
Ministry of Environment Office.
