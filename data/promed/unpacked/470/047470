Killer chicken virus diagnosed
------------------------------
The mysterious virus that killed more than 35 chickens in lower
Melphay, Trashigang, in January 2005 has been diagnosed as Newcastle
disease, say officials of the regional veterinary laboratory in
Khaling. "We detected the disease from the blood samples of the dead
chickens," a spokesperson for the veterinary laboratory told Kuensel.
The virus, which spread to upper Melphay, has now killed more than
100 chickens in the village. It completely wiped out the poultry in 2
out of 5 households who reared poultry in lower Melphay.
Sonam, a man from upper Melphay who reared about 60 chickens in his
small poultry farm, has lost all of them within weeks. Surprisingly,
the virus has not affected his neighbours' poultry.
According to the veterinary laboratory spokesperson, the birds in the
3 households are still surviving probably because people confined
their birds to the aviary, not letting them out to mingle with
affected chickens.
"Other reasons could be because these people reared local chickens,
which are more resistant to general poultry diseases," said the
spokesperson. "Or maybe people from affected places haven't visited
upper Melphay."
He added that it was quite unusual that the veterinary hospital in
Trashigang missed the vaccination. "There were enough vaccines in
stock."
The birds must be vaccinated at least once every 3 to 4 months. That,
according to the laboratory spokesman, was the only way to control
and prevent [infection by] the virus. "There is no cure for the
disease; it can only be prevented with timely vaccination," he said.
In the past, the vaccine, which is injected into chickens
(thermostable Newcastle I-2), was bought from India, but now Bhutan
produces its own vaccines in Serbithang, Thimphu, and has also
simplified the process. "All we have to do is put a few drops of the
vaccine into the bird's eyes," said the spokesperson. "And there are
no objections, because people prefer the simplified method." [see
comment].
Officials from the laboratory in Khaling have worked out ways to
control [the spread of Newcastle disease] to other dzongkhags [local
government districts]. "We will ban the movement of poultry products like
chickens and eggs, especially those from affected areas," said the
spokesperson. "It is reported that the disease has already reached Changmey
in Rangjung."
The villagers in Melphay are eager to rear new farm supplied poultry.
But they have been asked to wait by the veterinary hospital. Starting
next week, the laboratory in Khaling will start a mass vaccination of
all the chickens that the villagers buy. "We will also be giving them
other disinfectants besides the vaccines," said the spokesperson.

[In its last annual report to the OIE (2003), Bhutan included the
following remark: "Although Newcastle disease [NCD] has not been
reported from the field, the disease is endemic in the country.
Vaccination has not picked up in the villages yet" (32 421 avians
reportedly vaccinated). During 2004, outbreaks were reported in March.
Vaccinating village chickens with a live attenuated NCD vaccine based
upon the thermostable I-2 virus strain, using the eye-drop
application, has been shown to be effective in several developing
countries. See, for example, P. N. Wambura et al (2000): Experimental
trials with a thermostable Newcastle disease virus (strain I-2) in
commercial and village chickens in Tanzania; Preventive Veterinary
Medicine, 43, 2, 75-83. - Mod.AS]
