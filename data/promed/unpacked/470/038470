A bacterial infection is being blamed for killing fish in one of the Finger Lakes [New York State].

The Democrat and Chronicle of Rochester [New York State] reports (http://on.rocne.ws/1pm4Yqp) that more than 1000 dead fish have been removed from Canandaigua Lake's public shoreline in the past few days.

The state Department of Environmental Conservation took fish samples Monday [23 Jun 2014] and preliminary test results showed that the fish are suffering from columnaris. The bacterial infection is affecting mostly smaller fish like sunfish and perch.

State health officials say there is no danger to humans swimming in Canandaigua Lake during the fish die-off.


There is no treatment for the fish disease, and it is generally left to run its course.

Columnaris disease is caused by _Flavobacterium columnare_, a Gram-negative bacterium. It affects freshwater fish worldwide. Stress and pollutants in water can affect the severity of _F. columnare_ infections in fish, so it is pertinent to look at an underlying cause.
