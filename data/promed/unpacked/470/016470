[This is a high mortality outbreak reaching 100 percent, with 290
birds dying out of 290 cases in the population of 1865 susceptible
birds. The rest were destroyed. Let's hope that the control measures
are effective and that no important local festival was occurring at
the time of the outbreak because spread of such a high mortality H5N1
could cause significant damage. Hopefully, it will remain a single
outbreak. - Mod.PC]
