Herders in Marsabit County are counting loses following an outbreak of a mysterious disease that is killing camels.

Bubisa and Shuur in Marsabit North Sub-County are the worst hit by the calamity with ward representative Pius Yatani describing the situation as alarming.

"I received the report on 19 Jan [2016] on the deaths and so far more than 500 camels have perished. I believe the disease may have erupted earlier,'' said Turbi-Bubisa Ward Rep.

Mr Yatani said he had appealed to the county government for urgent intervention.

He said a team of vets was already on the ground supplying vaccines donated by the county government to the pastoralists.

"The department of livestock has donated 20 dozen vaccines to help mitigate the crisis," he said by telephone.

Speaking to the Nation by phone, Shuur Pastoralist Community Initiative and Development Assistance (Pacida) programme coordinator Wario Guyo, said the animals were dying in large numbers.

"They (camels) are in good body shape but they suddenly become weak before dying,'' he said.

Marsabit County Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries executive James Aboran Dokhe said he was aware of the outbreak of the disease.

He said the disease was likely to have been spread from neighbouring Wajir where 3 weeks ago Wajir South MP Abdullahi Diriye raised the alarm over an unknown disease killing camels in the county.

Dr Dokhe said his department had responded to the emergency and had dispatched a team of experts to identify the mysterious disease.

"Once the tests are completed we will send the report to the University of Nairobi's veterinary department of for analysis,'' said the CEC [county executive committee member].

Mr Dokhe said the disease was likely to be trypanosomiasis-protozoa.

[Results of the epidemiological and laboratory investigations, and information on the nature of the vaccines supplied, will be appreciated.

Several disease agents may be included in the differential-diagnosis to be considered. A list of infectious diseases which are "known to produce significant diseases" in dromedary camels ("List I") is available at the OIE website: http://www.oie.int/our-scientific-expertise/specific-information-and-recommendations/camelidae-diseases/.

On top of trypanosomiasis, Rift Valley fever (RVF) may deserve consideration, among others as well, though this etiology is probably not high on the candidates list. A paper describing morbidity and mortality due to RVF in dromedary camels, with pictures, is available at http://193.190.239.98/bitstream/handle/10390/6696/2011eidi1894.pdf?sequence=1). Outbreaks of RVF are closely associated with periods of heavy rains and prolonged flooding, as those driven by the warm phase of the El Nino/ Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, increasing habitat suitability for vector populations. In East Africa, RVF epidemics take place periodically every 10 years; the last major outbreak occurred in 2006-2007. El Nino is expected to remain strong through the northern hemisphere winter 2015-2016 (see http://tinyurl.com/z7jr4). RVF is more likely to affect small ruminants and cattle; it is zoonotic.

According to a commentary from a reader published by the Daily Nation, large quantities of waste have been buried in the Marsabit region, leading to the need to consider chemicals-related, environmental etiology as well. Such a scenario is supported by the description, in the media report, of the affected camels as being "in good body shape," suddenly becoming weak before dying. - Mod.AS
