A measles outbreak has been recorded in the Rostov region. Since the
middle of October 2011, the disease has affected more than 20 people.
No cases of measles had been recorded in the region during the
previous 2 years according to Tatyana Vygonskaya of Health and Social
Development in the Rostov region.

Since the middle of 21 Oct 2011, 21 cases of measles have been
diagnosed, all but one of whom were children. The remaining case was a
woman who works as a dermatologist.

According to Vygonskaya, 60 percent of cases are children under one
year of age, and the others are children from deprived families. The
last case was reported on Fri 11 Nov 2011, a sick child who had come
to Rostov from Chechnya. The head of the Regional Ministry of Health
stated that diagnosis of measles in the early stages of infection is
difficult because the initial symptoms are a runny nose and fever,
common symptoms of many viral diseases.

During the 1st 7 months of 2011, the incidence rate of measles in
Russia was 0.12 per 100 000 inhabitants, which was 1.6 times higher
than the same period in the preceding year. In total, from January to
July 2011, 170 cases of infection were registered in Russia. The
largest number of cases (59) was recorded in Moscow. The Astrakhan
region recorded 26 cases of measles, Krasnoyarsk 20 cases, Stavropol
17 cases, and the Tomsk region 14 cases. Children were less than a
quarter of all cases. More than half of the measles-infected adults
had not been vaccinated.

The Chief Sanitary Physician of the Russian Federation, Gennadiy
Onischenko, observed that in 2011, less than 1/3rd of Russians aged
between 18 and 35 years had been vaccinated against measles. In 8
regions, the proportion did not exceed 10 percent, and in 8 regions,
vaccination had not yet begun (see Med Novoti (in Russia)

Health bosses are battling a measles outbreak. Nine children at 2 Hove
schools have been diagnosed with the potentially fatal infectious
disease in the past couple of weeks, more than the entire number of
cases in the whole of Sussex last year [2010]. City health bosses are
working with the Health Protection Agency to try to prevent the spread
of the disease, which can cause serious side effects such as brain
damage and fits.

Vaccinations have been organised for pupils at Davigdor Infant and
Somerhill Junior schools next week, where there have been a cluster of
cases. In some cases, babies too young to be vaccinated have
contracted the illness from contact with infected older children who
have not been given the jabs.

Brighton and Hove has had 29 cases confirmed since the start of the
year [2011], and another 13 patients are suspected to have measles.

Last year [2010], there were just 2 confirmed cases of measles in the
city and 8 in total across the county. Health bosses are urging
parents to make sure their children have been inoculated. The mother
of one baby who caught the illness said parents who chose not to take
up the MMR jab were "playing Russian roulette" with children's lives.

There's a confirmed case of measles in Edmonton, and Alberta Health
Services (AHS) is putting out an advisory to those who may have been
exposed to it. Measles is extremely contagious if you haven't either
had it before or been vaccinated against it. Alberta Health Services
says you may have been exposed to the disease if you were at Manulife
Place office tower downtown between the hours of 7 am - 9 pm from 1-3
Nov 2011, or the morning hours of 4 Nov 2011.

The advisory extends to those who were at the Synergy Fall Social
Event in the main ballroom of Sutton Place Hotel the evening of 3 Nov
2011 and to the emergency room at University Hospital between the
hours of 7 pm - 4:30 am on 9 Nov 2011.

Symptoms of measles include a fever, cough, runny nose or red eyes,
and a red blotchy rash that appears 3-7 days after the fever starts
and spreads over the entire body. If you may have been exposed to the
disease or have concerns about possibly having a case of measles, call
Health Link Alberta immediately. The numbers to call in Edmonton are

Health officials are warning people in Edmonton to be on the lookout
for symptoms of measles after someone contracted the virus from an
overseas trip. Medical health officer Dr. Marcia Johnson says people
may have been exposed to measles. According to CBC: "There are a
number of people that may have been potentially exposed," said Dr.
Marcia Johnson, medical health officer for Edmonton, "and we want to
let the people who may have been exposed [to] know what exposures may
have occurred and ask them, if they were exposed, to phone Health."

Measles is extremely contagious and spread by coughing and sneezing.
Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose or red eyes, as well as a
red blotchy rash that usually starts behind the ears and face several
days after fever starts. Alberta Health Services says people who were
at the following places at these times may have been exposed:
- Manulife Place (office tower only)
1-3 Nov 2011 - 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.
4 Nov 2011 - 9 a.m. to noon
- Sutton Place Hotel, main ballroom
3 Nov 2011 - 5 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.
- University of Alberta Hospital emergency room
8 Nov 2011 - 7:30 p.m. to midnight
9 Nov 2011 - Midnight to 4:30 a.m.
Johnson said people who were in those areas should be tested if they
have never had measles or are not already vaccinated.

Since a recent measles warning was issued earlier this week [see
above], Alberta Health Services (AHS) says HealthLink Alberta has
heard from about 100 people who may have come into contact with a
person who contracted the disease. Dr. Marcia Johnson with AHS also
says there were 2 more possible cases as of Friday [18 Nov 2011]
afternoon. A 3rd, detected earlier, was ruled out.

The person who touched off the advisory would have been at Manulife
Place downtown between 1-4 Nov 2011, as well as the Synergy Fall Fair
at Sutton Place Hotel the night of 3 Nov 2011, and the emergency room
at University Hospital overnight from 8-9 Nov 2011. Potentially, as
many as 1000 people could have come into contact with the person.

Since details were released on Tue 25 Nov 2011, AHS has been
encouraging people who haven't had measles or haven't been immunized
to call HealthLink Alberta -- 780-408-LINK (5465), in Edmonton;
toll-free, 1-866-408-LINK -- if they have concerns or are showing
symptoms.

Saskatchewan's Ministry of Health is warning residents about measles,
something the province hasn't seen much of for more than a decade. Two
kids and 4 adults have caught the virus in the last year. All 6 cases
are in Regina, and so far officials say they are not believed to be
connected.

Deputy chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Saqib Shahab believes what
we're seeing is in reaction to outbreaks in other parts of the
continent. Generally, measles shouldn't be of great concern, because
the immunization rate in Saskatchewan was 94 per cent.

Parents of children under the age of one are being advised to keep
their child away from anyone showing symptoms because they would have
not yet received their 1st vaccination against measles.

Parents are being urged to immunize their kids against measles, as a
record-breaking outbreak of measles has hit Indiana and Minnesota. The
Michigan Academy of Family Physicians says the recent outbreak is part
of the largest national outbreak in 15 years. According to the Centers
for Disease Control (CDC), over 214 children have been infected with
measles across the country this year [2011] alone, a 300 percent
increase over typical years and the largest outbreak in the last 15
years.

"This year [2011], more than any other in recent memory, it is
important that parents immunize their children against preventable but
devastating diseases like the measles," said Michigan Academy of
Family Physicians (MAFP) President Peter Graham, M.D. in a press
release. "Immunizations are a simple step that can keep Michigan kids
healthy, even with outbreaks on the rise and children being
hospitalized by the dozens in nearby states like Indiana and
Minnesota."

Measles is an infectious disease that causes fever, runny nose, cough
and a rash all over the body. The infection can lead to pneumonia,
encephalitis and is fatal in one or 2 cases out of every 1000. Measles
spreads through the air by breathing, coughing or sneezing. It is so
contagious that any child who is exposed to it and is not immune will
probably get the disease.

Following reports of an outbreak of measles among children, the
district administration on Friday [18 Nov 2011] launched a special
campaign to administer anti-measles vaccines among the kids.

Civil surgeon Shashibhushan Singh said 536 000 children would be
covered under the special vaccination programme. He added that the
report received [reports] from the rural areas of Dhanbad suggesting
an outbreak of measles during this time of changing season.

The administration has engaged 8291 health department staff under the
special vaccination programme. On the 1st day, 92 000 children at all
block primary health centres were administered vaccines. Singh himself
visited PHCs at Govindpur, Nirsa and Koylanagar to supervise the
vaccination programme.

[This is the 1st report of an outbreak of measles virus infection from
the Indian subcontinent during the current multi-country outbreak.
There is no indication of the number of cases involved, but the
vaccination response is considerable. According to UNICEF, vaccination
coverage in India was high, at 87 percent, in 2010 but not sufficient
to eliminate the disease.

Dhanbad is a city in the Indian state of Jharkhand and is also known
as the Coal Capital of India. Dhanbad is the 79th fastest growing city
in world. According to the 2011 census, Dhanbad is among the 35 cities
of India with a population of more than one million. Maps showing the

After 7 years measles-free, the MidCentral District Health Board has
confirmed the 1st case of the disease at Palmerston North Hospital.
Medical officer of health Rob Weir said it was the 1st laboratory
confirmed case in the district since 2004.

There have been 430 cases elsewhere in New Zealand this year [2011],
so it was not a surprise it had spread to MidCentral. Public health
staff have asked close contacts who are not vaccinated or immune to
stay home for 2 weeks from the time they were exposed to the case.

The disease is highly infectious, and people were advised to make sure
they and their children were immunised as soon as possible. Measles
symptoms include fever, runny nose, a cough and sore, red eyes,
followed by a rash. People who think they might have measles should
stay home and phone a doctor or Healthline for advice.

Rotorua residents are being warned to get vaccinated against measles.
Health officials are warning about the spread of measles in Rotorua,
Taupo and the Bay of Plenty. There have been 10 confirmed cases across
the region covered by the Bay of Plenty and Lakes District health
boards since October [2011].

Toi Te Ora medical officer of health Dr Neil de Wet said most cases
had been in Rotorua and Tauranga, and it was likely to spread through
the region. Nationally, there had been more than 400 confirmed cases
this year [2011], and at least 70 required hospital treatment. Dr de
Wet said Toi Te Ora was following up with people who had been in close
contact with those confirmed to have measles. "People identified as
contacts who are not immunised are required to stay away from work or
school for 14 days to ensure that they don't inadvertently spread
measles should they become ill."

Dr de Wet said people should ensure they and their families were
protected against measles. "Measles immunisation provides effective
protection, and the vaccine is free for children and adults," he said.
"Because of the current outbreak of measles, babies from 12 months of
age can go to their family doctor or practice nurse for their 1st dose
of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine." Once a baby had the
vaccine at 12 months, the 2nd dose could be given 28 days later. "This
also applies to older children, teenagers and adults; if you have
missed your scheduled immunisation or you're not immunised, contact
your family doctor or practice nurse," Dr de Wet said.

People born before 1 Jan 1969 were likely to be immune, as measles
used to be more common. "For everyone born after 1 Jan 1969, it is
important to ensure that you have received the 2 doses of the MMR
vaccine. It's never too late to catch up. MMR vaccine immunisation
uptake has increased in the Bay of Plenty and Lakes region over the
last couple of weeks, and we would like to thank and acknowledge the
people who have had immunisations recently to protect themselves,
their family and their community from measles."

Ranolf Medical Centre senior practice nurse Ros Raworth said the
centre had seen a huge increase in the number of people getting the
MMR vaccine. "We don't have the figures yet, but we have 10 000
patients, and the nurses here are vaccinating at least one or 2 people
an hour with the MMR vaccine."
