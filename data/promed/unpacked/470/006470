Chikungunya may well have been present in most of Southeast Asia for
years. The vectors are there. We have seen "isolated" cases in
Thailand during the Viet Nam war, recognizing them only when the
suspected case of dengue developed rheumatoid-like arthritis shortly
after his fever subsided that responded dramatically to aspirin and
later NSAIDs. We had no readily available diagnostics at that time
(and still do not in this part of the world). It is very likely that
most (if not almost all) cases are diagnosed as dengue even if now
readily available dengue rapid diagnostics are negative (they often
become positive only later). We do need such a rapid diagnostic test
kit if we really want to know the epidemiology of chikungunya [virus].

[ProMED thanks Dr. Wilde for his comments. This kind of firsthand
information is very valuable. Apparently, diagnostic tests for
chikungunya virus are available in Thailand (see below) but require
access to a fairly sophisticated virology laboratory, which goes well
beyond a diagnostic kit which Prof. Wilde mentions in his comments. A
laboratory confirmed chikungunya virus outbreak in southern Thailand
was reported on 26 Oct 2008 by ProMED-MBDS (see ProMED-MBDS archive
no. 20081026.3380) citing the Thai Ministry of Public Health that the
outbreak of chikungunya in one village of Narathiwat province was
confirmed by HI (hemagglutination inhibition) and PCR (polymerase
chain reaction) from almost 40 patients' sera. PCR conducted on a
pool of _Aedes albopitus_ caught in the affected village was also
positive for chikungunya virus.
