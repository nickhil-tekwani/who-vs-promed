Set for war: the Safari giraffes and elephants already vaccinated
-------------------------------------------------
As part of the preparations for a possible attack on Israel, the Safari
park in Ramat-Gan [adjacent to Tel-Aviv] has begun to vaccinate the animals
against anthrax. The first vaccinations have been carried out last week, to
be continued this week.
The Safari spokesperson, Rachel Klang, confirmed yesterday that elephants
and giraffes have already been vaccinated due to their very small number in
Israel. "We would rather maintain, at least, a breeding nucleus of the rare
species, so that in case of attack the animals of the safari park could be
recovered."
Anthrax vaccination is given to animals because they are extremely
sensitive to the disease -- much more than humans. Once infected, untreated
animals die swiftly, within a few days. Sometimes, there is sudden death
without any clinical symptoms.
Anthrax is known to be one of the most lethal diseases, affecting many
animal species in various parts of the world. Among the most susceptible
animals are sheep, goats, horses, donkeys, dogs, and pigs. There are also
many reports regarding elephants, lions, and hippos that died in Africa.
The most efficient way to protect animals is vaccination; one vaccination
will convey protection for 9 months on average.
Incidentally, as part of the Ramat-Gan municipality's preparations for the
anticipated war, special guns have been prepared to disable or kill
dangerous animals, such as lions, should a missile destroy their cages or
the safari park's outer wall.

[Though captive gazelles have been vaccinated (against FMD) only once, when
there was an outbreak in wild gazelles in 1985, this might be the first
time captive zoo animals have been vaccinated against anthrax in Israel.
The anthrax vaccine used for livestock in Israel is the classical Sterne
vaccine. According to OIE's Manual of Standards for diagnostic tests and
vaccines, "most experts agree that immunity is good for at least one year,
and it is recommended that an annual booster be given. Horses may be slow
to develop immunity following initial vaccination; some manufacturers
therefore recommend a 2-dose initial vaccination, administered one month
apart, followed by a single annual booster."
<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00038.htm>
Israel's traditional practice is to carry out annual vaccinations of
livestock on infected premises for 10 consecutive years following an
outbreak. Approximately 2000 vaccinations of domestic ruminants have been
carried out in each of the years 2000 and 2001.
Remarks and advice are welcome from those who are ready to share with
ProMED-mail readers their experience of anthrax vaccination in wildlife. -

[A sensible precaution because in the chaos of war, if anthrax spores were
deployed and these animals exposed, any carcasses of dead animals are not
likely to be disposed of promptly. It would take a few years to be assured
that environmental contamination from the carcasses had not occurred in the
park. The Sterne vaccine is very cheap and therefore the benefit cost ratio
of its proactive use is very positive. Plus parks with healthy animals are
excellent for boosting morale in troubled times. MHJ Mod.]
