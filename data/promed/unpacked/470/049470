Thousands of fish in Lake Naivasha have died in the last 2 days [17-18
Feb 2010], raising fears among fishermen and locals. Part of the lake
has been covered by the decaying fish as a heavy odour filters across
the water body that is said to be on its deathbed.

All species of fish in the lake have been affected by the mysterious
disease, with fingers pointing to toxic wastes from flower farms. A
visit to the lake by KBC found fishermen collecting the fish from the
lake and burying them by the beach as tourists, unaware of the
incident, toured the lake.

According to an eco-tour operator, David Kilo, they first noticed huge
common carp floating near the beaches. "We got concerned after finding
at least 200 fish floating in a section of the lake, all with bloated
bodies," he said and attributed the deaths to chemicals from flower
farms around the lake, adding that the problem could get worse in
coming days.

"Chemical run offs from the farms have been the order of the day, and
the situation has been made worse by heavy rains that have pounded the
area in the last 2 days," a conservationist, Mr Nigel Warren, who was
once a member of the Lake Naivasha Riparian Association, said.

Pollution caused by large scale flower farming has been wreaking havoc
on the lake, which is the only fresh water ecosystem in the east. "I
resigned from the association in protest, and flower farms around the
lake have, in one way or the other, contributed to the current status
of the lake," said the former UK soldier.

A researcher from Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute
(KEMFRI), George Morara, said that deaths could have been caused by
suffocation or pollution. Speaking on the phone, Morara said that
samples had already been taken to the institute's laboratory, and
results would be out by Monday next week [22 Feb 2010]. "Initial
investigations show that the fish died from suffocation, as their
mouths and gills were open." He added that the majority of the dead
fish were found in shallow areas which had been covered in silt
following the heavy rains. "There could be depletion of oxygen when
the organic matter decomposes, causing the deaths of the fish." He was
quick to add that they did not rule out pollution, adding that
laboratory results would clear up the issue.

In the last couple of months, the lake's water level and quality have
dropped, with experts warning that the lake faces an ecological
collapse.

[Fish die-offs in the Naivasha lake ecosystem as well as damage to
various other species have been reported also in previous years. One
of the suspected pesticides was Carbofuran (Furadan, Curater), a
highly toxic carbamate, allegedly in wide use in the area. The event
could, however, be attributed to a wide range of other possible factors.

Results of the laboratory and epidemiological investigations are
expected with concern. - Mod.AS]
