Encephalitis Virus Detected in Chicken Flocks
---------------------------------------------
A warning has been issued to people in far northern and western parts of
New South Wales to take precautions against the mosquito-borne disease
Australian Encephalitis. ["Australian" encephalitis is assumed to be a
synonym for Murray Valley encephalitis. - Mod.CP
Evidence of this potentially fatal disease has been found during routine
testing of chicken flocks in areas around Broken Hill, Bourke and Walgett.
The last outbreak of the disease occurred in 1974 and killed 10 people.
Infectious diseases expert Dr. Jeremy McAnaulty said only one in 1000
people who contract the disease develop serious symptoms. "This is a virus
[see Mod. comment that in most people who get infected causes no symptoms
at all, but in a minority, maybe one in a 1000 of people who get infected
with it, can have some serious illness, encephalitis or brain infection,"
he said.

[There is no such virus as Australian encephalitis virus. Murray Valley
encephalitis virus, a flavivirus belonging to the Japanese encephalitis
virus complex, is presumed to be the subject of this report. Murray Valley
encephalitis virus infection can produce a potentially fatal illness in a
small proportion of cases. The symptoms are severe headache, stiff neck,
high fever, and in some cases the disease progresses to delirium and coma.
Murray Valley encephalitis virus is present in the northwest of Western
Australia and the Top End of the Northern Territory during most years. The
virus is transmitted by the bite of the common banded mosquito (_Culex
annulirostris_). - Mod.CP
