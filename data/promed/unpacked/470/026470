Brucella infection in Calcutta, India
-------------------------------------
[Data are available for] patients who were suffering from long, continued
fever and who were not cured by any conventional therapy at one Centre
(Peerless Hospital). After analysis of the data it was found that on an
average 39% patients of this group at this Centre in Calcutta were found
suffering from brucellosis and all of them were cured after treatment of
brucellosis [including] many patients [who had been moribund]. The
diagnosis was based both on serological test and culture. In 1995, [for
patients with the same presentation,] out of 6 patients 3(50%) were
positive, in 1996 out of 13 cases 6 (46%) were positive, in 1997 out of 38
cases 19(50%) were positive, in 1998 out of 51 cases 16(31%) were positive,
in 1999 out of 59 cases 16(27%) were positive, and in 2000 up to the month
of June, out of 31 cases 17(55%) were positive. Altogether it was found
that out of 198 cases 77(39%) were positive for _Brucella_ infection. We
are now looking for possible sources of this infection.

[It is noteworthy that these data have been collected over a period of
time, rather than being representative of an outbreak of disease. The data
suggest that monitoring of patients exhibiting the symptoms described at a
larger number of institutions would reveal a much larger number of cases in
Calcutta. - Mod.ES]
