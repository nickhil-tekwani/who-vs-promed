The Ministry of Agriculture said Sunday [9 Jun 2013] that an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] has been confirmed in cattle in southwest China's Yunnan Province.

A village in Shangri-La County reported on 3 Jun 2013 that 283 head of cattle had shown signs of the disease. National laboratory test results released on Sunday [9 Jun 2013] confirmed that the cattle are infected with type A FMD, the ministry said in a statement on its website.

It said local authorities have sealed off and sterilized an infected area where 1767 head of cattle have been culled and safely disposed of.

In case the information above is officially confirmed, this will mean that the FMD serotype A virus strain, reportedly spreading in China since early 2013, has been identified in a 5th province, threatening 3 of China's southern neighbours. The provinces already reported as infected are Guangdong, Qinghai, Xinjiang, and Tibet. China has applied a stamping out policy in relation to this virus strain, which is termed "new" and has already been genotyped.

Confirmation or otherwise, and, if confirmed, official reporting to the OIE, are anticipated.- Mod.AS]
