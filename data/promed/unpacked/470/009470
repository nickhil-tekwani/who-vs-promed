An exotic tick bite on a 12-year-old girl in Bergen County may be a 1st-of-its-kind case in the United States, leaving researchers with questions about whether the invasive species will transmit disease among human beings.

Scientists believe the longhorned tick, a species native to China, Korea and Japan, 1st appeared in New Jersey in 2013. Specialists at Rutgers University collected the specimen from a dog in Union County.

As cattle ticks and or bush ticks, they are generally found on livestock and wildlife, though they also infest domesticated cats and dogs.

The discovery in Bergen County came after the 12-year-old child spent a day in Leona and Edgewater in early July [2018], according to NorthJersey.com. When the girl's mother found the tick on her daughter's stomach, she took it to a neighbor who offers community education on ticks.

Unable to identify the species, the neighbor sent the parasite to be analyzed at a lab in Colorado, where the girl's family hoped to determine whether it carried any dangerous pathogens.

In Asian populations, longhorned ticks have been known spread diseases including the SFTS [severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome] virus and Japanese spotted fever.

The lab in Colorado determined that the specimen did not test positive for any pathogens, but that doesn't necessarily mean humans will remain immune to future diseases picked up as the tick spreads in the United States.

Researchers say the longhorned tick has been spotted in New York, North Carolina, Virginia and Arkansas.

New Jersey and Pennsylvania are among the states most heavily impacted by ticks and the danger of contracting Lyme disease. Longhorned ticks, which resemble common blacklegged ticks to the naked eye, are dark brown and can grow to the size of a pea when filled with blood.

Rutgers researchers plan to continue following the spread of longhorned ticks to monitor whether they may eventually pose a public health threat.

The USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratory has confirmed that the longhorned tick (_Haemaphysalis longicornis_) was found at Soldier Hill Golf Course in Bergen County, making it the 5th county in New Jersey known to have the tick. The longhorned tick was also found on a child in Bergen County at a separate location. That confirmation came from the Rutgers Center for Vector Biology at Rutgers University-New Brunswick. The child was not bitten by the tick, and tests by a private lab revealed no pathogens in that tick. Earlier findings have been confirmed in Hunterdon, Union, Middlesex and Mercer counties.

Some of these findings were a result of a statewide "Tick Blitz," led by the Rutgers Center for Vector Biology in May 2018 and developed primarily by professionals from New Jersey's county mosquito control programs. The longhorned tick was newly identified in both Middlesex and Mercer Counties during the Tick Blitz, with additional locations identified within Union and Hunterdon Counties. Bergen County officials continued looking for ticks within their county after the Tick Blitz, which led to the finding of the longhorned tick at Soldier Hill Golf Course.

Other public parks where the longhorned tick has been found include Davidson Mill County Pond Park in Middlesex County and Watchung Reservation, Houdaille Quarry Park and Briant Park in Union County. There have also been confirmed findings of the longhorned tick in New York, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia and Arkansas.

Various local, state, and federal animal health agencies, as well as Rutgers-New Brunswick, continue to work together to identify the range of the longhorned tick in New Jersey. Longhorned ticks that have been collected in New Jersey thus far have tested negative for various human and animal pathogens.

Like blacklegged ticks, the nymphs of the longhorned tick are very small (resembling tiny spiders) and can easily go unnoticed on animals and people. Although specimens identified in New Jersey have not been found to carry pathogens, longhorned ticks in other countries have been shown to spread diseases. They are known to infest a wide range of species including humans, dogs, cats, and livestock.

"We want to emphasize that it is important that people continue to use normal tick prevention measures for themselves, their pets and livestock," said Dr. Manoel Tamassia, the New Jersey Department of Agriculture State Veterinarian. "We will work to continue to develop strategies to control the spread of the tick to other areas."

As part of New Jersey's investigation, counties have set up drop off locations for the public to submit suspected longhorned ticks they find on themselves, their pets, livestock or on wildlife. Information on these locations and how to submit a tick can be found on the New Jersey Department of Agriculture's website at http://www.state.nj.us/agriculture/divisions/ah/.

A phone line has also been established to leave a message if a tick is found and there is uncertainty about what the next steps are. If you need information about what to do if you find a tick on yourself, your pets or livestock, call 1-833-NEWTICK (1-833-639-8425).

[This is the 1st report of a longhorned tick taken from a human in the USA. Finding this species of tick on a human is not surprising because it is known to occur on humans in Asia.

As noted earlier, the discovery of this tick in several different states in the eastern USA, and now in several locations in New Jersey, makes one wonder whether this tick has become established in the eastern USA. Either the tick is spreading rapidly, or surveillance has been intensified, or both. With discovery of this tick in widely divergent localities in the USA in the past 8 months, one wonders whether it is being moved via birds or by infested domestic animals.

As the report above indicates, this tick is a vector of important pathogens that infect people and domestic animals. One wonders whether this tick is capable of transmitting tickborne pathogens that already occur in the eastern USA, such as Powassan virus and Lyme borreliosis. One hopes that there will be intensified surveillance in broad areas in the eastern USA to find out whether there are additional bush ticks in the area. Ticks can be extremely difficult to control once established in an area.
