[This is a bit unusual. The oyster mushroom (_Pleurotus ostreatus_) is not
generally regarded as toxic, but rather a desirable, edible mushroom. There
are a few other mushrooms that they could be confused with, but those are
generally bitter and are recognized quickly. There may be some toxin that
was sprayed onto these mushrooms, or perhaps some toxin associated with the
organic material where the mushrooms were growing. It is also possible the
mushrooms referred to in the article are not really oyster mushrooms at all
and are some other less desirable mushroom that is toxic. - Mod.TG]
