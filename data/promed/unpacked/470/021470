On 14 Aug 2008, anthrax was diagnosed by bone marrow culture of a
bovine metacarpal. The dead animal belonged to an estancia [cattle
ranch] located at the paraje Banderalo, close to National Highway
188, in the Partido de General Villegas, Buenos Aires Province. The
exposed animals included a herd of 120 steers that are grazing on a
mixed pasture for a year and were not vaccinated; in addition, the
area is going through a drought.

The affected animal died suddenly and lost un-coagulated blood from
natural openings. The veterinarian disposed of the carcass with the
controlled covered technique [Tapado Controlado], decontaminating
beforehand with 5 percent formaldehyde.

Personnel working on the farm recalled an outbreak that occurred in the 1980's.

[According to Wikipedia a "paraje" is typically a camping place along
a long distance trail where travelers customarily stopped for the
night. A paraje can be a town, a village or pueblo, a caravanserai,
or simply a good location for stopping. Parajes typically are spaced
10 to 15 miles apart and feature abundant water and fodder for the
travelers' animals (cattle, sheep, and horses). During the 18th and
early 19th centuries, we had similar establishments in southern
Louisiana, similarly spaced, along what is now the I-90 from Houston
to New Orleans for Texas cattle being shipped to the East Coast. Our
thanks to Ramon for this prompt report.

It is still winter in Argentina, when anthrax outbreaks should be
infrequent if not rare. And the county (partido) of General Villegas
had no outbreaks in 2007; see 20080528.1731. Traditional anthrax
epidemiology, going back to van Ness, has sunken areas of higher risk
during droughts, as these maintain grazing longer than other areas,
and any brief shower will collect rain there with a subsequent burst
of new grazing growth. If an animal had died of anthrax there in the
past, leaving contaminated soil, the drought and brief shower would
draw animals to this potentially dangerous site.
