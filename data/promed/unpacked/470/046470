This week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reviewed a travel notice last updated in March 2019 concerning travel to Japan and the rubella outbreak.

Travelers to Japan should make sure they are vaccinated against rubella with the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine before travel, the federal health agency notes.

According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Tokyo, 2039 rubella cases have been reported through the end of July 2019, with most cases continuing to be reported in the Kanto region (Tokyo, Kanagawa, Chiba, and Saitama).

Rubella is a contagious disease caused by a virus. Most people who get rubella usually have a mild illness, with symptoms that can include a low-grade fever, sore throat, and a rash that starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body.

Rubella can cause a miscarriage or serious birth defects in a developing baby if a woman is infected while she is pregnant. The best protection against rubella is MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine.

[During 2018, Japan reported a total of 2917 rubella cases. The initial CDC Travel Alert for Japan regarding this rubella outbreak was issued on 22 Oct 2018.

The Japan rubella epidemic is mainly affecting men from their late 30s to early 50s. This is because, between August 1977 and March 1995, the rubella vaccine was only given to girls.

With a change in vaccination policy, Japanese boys began receiving rubella vaccinations during April 1995.

Rubella on its own is not a high-risk infection, but rubella infection during early pregnancy can pose serious risks to the foetus, as in 90% of the cases, the virus is transmitted to the foetus. This can result in miscarriage, stillbirth, or congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in infants. CRS can cause deafness, disabilities, heart impairment, autism, and other birth defects. Around 40 000 children are born with birth defects due to CRS every year in India, according to WHO. - Mod.LK
