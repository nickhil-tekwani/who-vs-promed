Three horses in N.J. have been diagnosed with mosquito-borne disease over the past two weeks. Protect your horse from illness with proper vaccinations and a clean environment. Remove all standing water from bird baths, gutters and low-lying areas.

The New Jersey Department of Agriculture reported today that within the past 2 weeks 3 New Jersey horses have been found infected with either Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) or West Nile virus (WNV) .

A 25-year-old gelding from Monmouth County tested positive for WNV by serum neutralization and is recovering. In addition, a 3-year-old mare in Atlantic County succumbed to EEE on 10 August 2012 and a 4-year-old mare from Camden County, who was euthanized on 18 August 2012, also was infected with this disease.

Both WNV and EEE are carried in bird populations and transmitted by mosquitoes. Horses infected with EEE rarely survive. Neither virus is directly transmitted from infected horses to other horses or humans. Owners should discuss their horse's vaccination history against these diseases with their veterinarians. Seasonal timing of vaccination against WNV and EEE is recommended. For animals at high risk or with limited immunity, more frequent vaccination may be recommended in order to induce protective immunity during periods of likely exposure.

Vaccinations are not curative and will not protect a horse that has already been infected with either virus. More information about vaccination for these diseases is available at: http://www.aaep.org/core_vaccinations.htm>.

In addition, a horse's exposure to mosquitoes can be decreased by eliminating standing water in areas, including low lying areas on properties, tire ruts, old tires, gutters, etc. Water troughs, birdbaths etc. should be emptied or flushed every three days, at a minimum, to prevent growth of the mosquito population. Owners should also keep their animals inside barns, if possible, from dusk through dawn when mosquitoes are most active. Local mosquito agencies may also be contacted to help identify areas of concern, suggest areas for clean-up and/or treatment, and to identify possible sites for mosquito collection and testing.

Both EEE and WNV are reportable in New Jersey. If you have a horse exhibiting neurologic signs or questions or concerns, please call the Division of Animal Health at (609) 671-6400. The Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory can test horses for EEE and WNV. The NJDA Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory offers full necropsy service for equine at its new facility. Please contact the laboratory for additional information at (609) 406-6999.

The Eastern equine encephalitis risk level has been raised to "critical" in Halifax after an alpaca died Thursday from complications of the mosquito-borne illness. The animal, which resembles a small llama, was being housed on the Halifax-Plympton line.

Halifax was one of the communities that was sprayed in the first round of aerial spraying in July to kill the mosquitoes that carry the disease but it was not included in the second round of spraying done last week. "This is an indication that people should be practicing their personal protection measures," said Anne Roach, Department of Public Health spokeswoman. The EEE risk levels in the neighboring communities of East Bridgewater, Hanson, Pembroke and Plympton have also been raised to "high."

A horse in Georgetown has also died from complications of EEE. A horse in Ludlow tested positive for West Nile virus on 13 August 2012 and has since been euthanized because of complications from the disease.

The Department of Agricultural Resources is reminding animal owners that there are USDA licensed vaccines available to protect horses from West Nile virus and EEE.

For other susceptible species, owners should contact their veterinarians. In addition to vaccination, owners should reduce potential mosquito-breeding sites on their properties by eliminating standing water from containers such as buckets, tires and wading pools, especially after heavy rains.

[Eastern equine encephalitis is almost always fatal to horses. It is preventable with a vaccine. The vaccine is usually combined with West Nile Virus. It is very sad to have an animal infected, and either euthanized or die because owners do not want to get their animal vaccinated.

Eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) is a mosquito-borne viral disease of all equine species, such as horses, asses, and zebras. After infection, equines may suddenly die or show progressive central nervous system disorders. The rapidity of deterioration and eventual outcome of infection vary among individual horses. The equine mortality rate due to EEE ranges from 75 to 90 percent.

Eastern equine encyphalomyelitis virus (EEEV) is thought to have caused EEE in North American horses since 1831. However, the virus itself may have been present in its endemic form long before that. The virus did not receive its name until a major outbreak occurred in horses in coastal areas of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and Virginia in 1933.

Additional outbreaks occurred in Virginia and North Carolina in 1934 and 1935 respectively. Mosquitoes were first determined to be potential carriers of EEEV in 1934.

The virus that causes EEE is transmitted primarily by mosquitoes that bite an infected animal and then bite and feed on another animal or human. The speed with which the disease spreads depends on the density of mosquito populations.

The clinical signs of EEE can be confused with those of other diseases that affect the central nervous system. These include Venezuelan equine encephalitis, Western equine encephalitis, West Nile equine encephalitis, African horse sickness, rabies, tetanus, and bacterial meningitis. EEE might also be mistaken for toxic poisoning. Definitive diagnosis can be made by isolating the virus in a laboratory or by testing blood for the presence of antibodies to the virus.

Equines infected with EEE may show one or more of the following signs:
• Fever
• Depression
• Loss of appetite
• Weakness
• Central nervous system disorders (lack of coordination, chewing movements, head pressing,
"sawhorse" stance, circling, paddling motion of the limbs, and convulsions)
• Irritability and aggressiveness towards handlers
• Blindness
• Excitability
• Abnormal sensitivity to light and sound

In some cases, horses infected with EEE may show no clinical signs before dying.

Vaccination can prevent your animal from suffering these abnormalities. While the vaccine is licensed for use in horses, it is best to check with your veterinarian before using it other animals.
