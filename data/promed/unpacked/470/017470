At least 9 people involved with the processing of an anthrax-tainted dead cow have been sickened with anthrax, according to the Bangladeshi news source The Independent today [24 Aug 2014]. The report states that the individuals were diagnosed with anthrax at Ambaria village in Madhupur upazila. Apparently, the infected bull [sic] was purchased at a bazaar a year and a half ago, and the animal got sick. The infected [people developed] skin sores and sought medical treatment, when doctors diagnosed anthrax.

Cutaneous anthrax occurs when the spore (or possibly the bacterium) enters a cut or abrasion on the skin. It starts out as a raised bump that looks like an insect bite. It then develops into a blackened lesion called an eschar that may form a scab. Lymph glands in the area may swell, plus edema may be present. This form of anthrax responds well to antibiotics. If untreated, deaths can occur if the infection goes systemic; 95 percent of cases of anthrax are cutaneous.

[The writer of this report is uncertain as to the sex of the affected animal, "cow," initially, and then a "bull." This could be just a confused reporter or that there were 2 animals affected, a bull and a cow, and something got lost in the editing. This is the monsoon season in Bangladesh, and grazing is limited because the pastures are flooded, and, therefore, cattle are fed on rice hay and dairy concentrates. Thus, livestock outbreaks at this time are more likely because of contaminated dairy feed. If I am correct, there will be additional outbreaks from other herds fed from the same batch of feed.

The news report has a map of Bangladesh, but it is of small scale. If you want a bigger map, go to: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/txu-pclmaps-oclc-742924775-bangladesh_pol-2011.jpg.
I tried to locate Madhupur but there are many Madhupurs in Bangladesh, ditto Ambaria. - Mod.MHJ
