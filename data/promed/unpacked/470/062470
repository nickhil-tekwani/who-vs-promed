Health Minister Midori de Habich, announced that MINSA [Ministry of Health of Peru] will declare a red alert for next week for the city of Juanjui, capital of the Mariscal Caceres Province, in the San Martin Region, where an outbreak of leptospirosis has been detected.

She said that a team from MINSA was in [Juanjui] 2 weeks ago, monitoring the situation and coordinating with the regional and local authorities the measures to be taken in the face of this disease. She also indicated that at this moment it is not necessary to declare a state of emergency in the zone, as had been requested by the provincial mayor, Renan Saavedra Sandoval. "We are monitoring the situation and we have sufficient medication for the rapid treatment of patients affected by this bacterial disease", she declared to the press.

For his part, the Vice Minister of Health, Jose Carlos Del Carmen, said that the outbreak of leptospirosis was specifically in San Martin, and 92 percent of the cases were reported in Juanjui. He confirmed that necessary interventions were in place in the affected zone to control this disease and dengue. "Our team was present in the jurisdiction to work on both these diseases and also addressing the issues of providing potable water [to the area], an aspect that has also been identified as needing intervention", he emphasized.

Finally, the Vice Minister announced that tomorrow [8 Apr 2013] the technical team from MINSA, together with the provincial mayor will evaluate the ongoing activities and conjointly develop a plan of action for controlling the situation. De Habich and Del Carmen presented these declarations while participating in events in Lima marking World Health Day.

According to some media reports, as of now there have been 66 cases of leptospirosis in Juanjui and 2 deaths, although there hasn't been an official report released.

Leptospirosis is caused by a bacterium and is transmitted to humans by [contact with] infected urine of rats and dogs.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that is distributed throughout the world in warm climates and is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals, or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. These animals are mostly asymptomatic but chronically infected with one of the several hundred serovars of pathogenic _Leptospira_. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions. In carrier animals with chronic renal infections, leptospiruria persists for long periods or for life. Leptospira bacteria shed in urine may survive in water or moist soil for weeks to months. Many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rodents) are susceptible to chronic urinary infection with pathogenic leptospira. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.

Juanjui with 24 085 inhabitants is the capital of the Mariscal Caceres province in the San Martin Region of Peru (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juanju%C3%AD). The town is located in the Huallaga River valley (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huallaga_River) in the northern and tropical part of Peru and has a tropical rainforest climate. Heavy rains occur from February to May that sometimes cause flooding and road washouts (http://tinyurl.com/d5lj3bf). However, no reports of flooding in the San Martin Region of Peru can be found on the Internet at the present time.

Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of leptospirosis, its diagnosis cannot be made confidently without laboratory confirmation. Leptospirosis may be confused with other diseases with other diseases such as Hantavirus infection (1).
