An epidemic of shigellosis has been confirmed in the Central African
Republic, with a total of 379 cases and 23 deaths from 16 Jun to 29 Oct
2003. The cases are in the regions of Paoua and Bozoum, north west of the
capital city, Bangui. Institut Pasteur, Bangui analysed stool samples and
confirmed the diagnosis of _Shigella dysenteriae_ type 1, which is
sensitive to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin.
Medecins sans Frontieres, Spain and Coopi are supporting the Ministry of
Health in containing the epidemic. However, since the affected regions face
important population movements as a result of the recent civil war, the
control of the epidemic is not straightforward. Migration of people to
neighboring Chad is also cause for concern.

In addition to the cholera outbreak, a steady increase in the number of
cases of bloody diarrheal has been registered since 18 Aug 2003 in
Monrovia, Liberia, with a total of 1857 cases. The number of deaths is not
registered in the health facilities that are participating in the emergency
surveillance system.
An average of 240 cases per week have been reported during the month of
October 2003. Stool samples have been taken, and the diagnosis of
shigellosis confirmed. Further laboratory investigations have ruled out
_Shigella dysenteriae_ type 1. WHO and UNICEF are coordinating
interventions to ensure proper management of cases and of the environment,
including safe water and sanitation.

[As is occurring in these 2 African countries, the consequences of war
include radical movement of people and shortages of potable water,
resulting in enteric infections such as shigellosis, typhoid, and cholera.
