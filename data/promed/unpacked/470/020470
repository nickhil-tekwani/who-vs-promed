Hepatitis C epidemic -- 1000 cases per year
-------------------------------------------
Little known before the early 2000s, hepatitis C virus (HCV)
infection has reached epidemic levels in the Montreal area. There have
been about 1000 new cases annually during the past 4 to 5 years
according to Dr Richard Lessard, director of the Montreal DSP
[Direction de sante publique de Montreal; public health department].
This figure may represent only a fraction of the actual number of
cases. "We cannot know the percentage of infected people in the
general population." Dr Lessard stated further that: "We only know the
situation for people who have undergone screening. However, we know
that the infection is prevalent in all districts of the city of
Montreal. "Initially, HCV was present mainly in the city centre and in
the south west district, but currently the problem is present in all
areas of Montreal island."

Nearly 50 per cent of infected people are or have been users of
injected drugs. "HCV is transmitted by blood. Needle re-use is the
main route of transmission," according to Dr Lessard. HCV infection is
3 times commoner in men than in women. In 95 per cent of cases, people
who exchange syringes will become infected in the 1st 6 months after
becoming addicted. Dr Lessard advised that the establishment of
supervised injection facilities should be considered as an approach
toward curbing this scourge. "We must improve our prevention
strategies to prevent the problem snowballing out of control."

To a lesser extent, use of other types of drug pose problems in
relation to HCV (and HIV) infection. Sandra Trifa, a nurse involved in
HCV and HIV infection control stated that: "Pipes used for smoking
crack [cocaine] also represent a risk [for transmission of virus]
because they may cause burns and bleeding lips." Nurse Trifa also
indicated that nasal inhalation is another route of infection, because
the occurrence of micro damage in the nasal passages contributes to
the spread of HCV, which is a more virulent [contagious?] virus than
HIV. "Whereas HIV is inactivated rapidly at ambient temperatures, HCV
can remain infectious for up to 16 hours under the same conditions,
and can remain infectious for as long as 163 days in a contaminated
syringe," according to Nurse Trifa.

In 2009, 45 per cent of all HCV diagnoses in Quebec [province] were
made in Montreal.

[About 60-70 per cent of people newly infected with HCV typically are
usually asymptomatic or have a mild clinical illness. Although HCV RNA
can be detected in blood within 1-3 weeks after exposure, the average
time from exposure to seroconversion is 8-9 weeks, and anti-HCV can be
detected in greater than 97 per cent of people by 6 months after
exposure. Chronic HCV infection develops in 70 per cent to 85 per cent
of HCV-infected people and 60 per cent to 70 per cent of people with
chronic infection have evidence of active liver disease. Most of those
infected might not be aware of their infection because they are not
clinically ill, but they serve as a source of transmission to others
and are at risk of chronic liver disease or other HCV-related chronic
diseases decades after infection.

HCV is most efficiently transmitted through large or repeated
percutaneous exposure to infected blood (such as, through transfusion
of blood from unscreened donors or through use of injecting drugs).
Although much less frequent, occupational, perinatal, and sexual
exposures also can result in transmission of HCV. Surveillance data
also indicate that 15 per cent to 20 per cent of people reported with
acute HCV infection have a history of sexual exposure in the absence
of other risk factors.

15 per cent to 25 per cent of people clear the virus from their
bodies without treatment and do not develop chronic infection, but HCV
infection becomes chronic in about 75 per cent to 85 per cent of
cases.

Chronic liver disease in people with HCV infection is usually
insidious, progressing slowly without any signs or symptoms for
several decades and often not recognized until asymptomatic people are
identified as HCV-positive or when elevated alanine aminotransferase
levels are detected during routine examinations.

and elsewhere can be obtained at
