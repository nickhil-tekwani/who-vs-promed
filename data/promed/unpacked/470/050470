Northwest China yesterday [24 Nov 2005] reported an outbreak of bird flu, the
7th in less than 10 days, as the World Health Organization (WHO) said it would
send a team to an eastern Chinese province where a woman was confirmed as
having been killed by the infection.
The 7 outbreaks reported since 15 Nov 2005 make Xinjiang the most-afflicted
area in the country, experts said.
3 of the outbreaks occurred in or around Urumchi, the regional capital,
according to the Agriculture Ministry's website.
The ministry and the local government were handling the latest outbreak in
accordance with emergency plans, officials said. Veterinary workers culled
5180 poultry within a 3km radius of the outbreak site in line with standard
practice, the ministry said in a statement.
Health authorities yesterday intensified an information campaign on prevention
of human infections, using prime-time TV slots and major newspapers urging
people to maintain a hygienic and healthy lifestyle and process poultry
products with caution.
The ministry has also published an updated version of Diagnosis and Treatment
Guidelines for Human Infection by Avian Influenza, detailing the sources,
symptoms, prevention and treatment for health workers.
In a related development, the United Nations said on Wednesday [23 Nov 2005]
that it supports China's massive animal vaccination programme to combat bird
flu, but cautioned that quality control on vaccines must be assured.
Joseph Domenech, chief veterinary officer of the UN Food and Agriculture
Organization, said agency officials would be among those visiting Chinese
laboratories, the Associated Press reported yesterday.
In a circular issued on Wednesday, the State Council, China's cabinet, asked
local governments to support and supervise designated vaccine producers, and
strike hard at those manufacturing fakes.
In Harbin, capital of Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, where water
supply has been cut off since midnight Tuesday, production of vaccines has not
been affected, said Han Biao, an executive with the First Biological Products
Plant of the Harbin Pharmaceuticals Group. The plant, one of the 9 designated
vaccine producers in China, produces 60 per cent of the doses used in the
country, Xinhua News Agency reported. [An exploson at a chemical plant
upstream of Harbin sent tons of benzene into the river which supplies most of
the city's water. - Mod.JW]

[The above official call to "strike hard at those manufacturing fakes"
deserves attention.
In our post 20051111.3299, we included the text of a letter from China's
Ministry of Agriculture to all farmers, warning them to refrain from using
fake vaccines against avian influenza, adding that counterfeit vaccines were
being sold in Liaoning province and that millions of birds may not be
protected from the virus. China's official notification to the OIE, dated 10
Nov 2005, indicated that 3 H5 vaccine types were applied:
1. Inactivated monovalent H5N2 Vaccine;
2. Inactivated recombinant H5N1 vaccine;
3. Live recombinant H5 vaccine vectored in avian pox virus.
The following [see item 2] list of the 9 avian influenza vaccine producers
which are officially designated in China has been kindly sent to ProMED-mail
by a reliable contact. The use of other Chinese AI vaccines, within China or
elsewhere, is contraindicated. - Mod.AS]

[As indicated by Dr David Swayne in posts 20050307.0680 and 20050308.0689, the
use of live AI virus vaccines in poultry is a very risky proposition,
especially for H5 and H7 subtypes, and is in theory strongly discouraged;
mutations of low-pathogenicity (LP) AI field viruses to high pathogenicity
(HP) have been well documented in several countries. However, with the advent
of reverse genetics, changes in one or more genes may result in the creation
of a live AI virus with reduced potential for mutation to HP. Furthermore, a
cold-adapted AI virus may be produced by selection of virus strains at lower
temperature. However, such viruses would need extensive safety testing for
reversion before accepting them as safe to apply in the field.
Any vaccine -- before use -- must be thoroughly investigated by the "competent
authority" of a country's government to determine its safety, purity, and
potency. After the principal approval of a vaccine type, it remains the
responsibility of the authority to supervise and monitor the control upon the
production, testing, distribution and application of each batch. It would be
reassuring to have confirmation that all batches of AI vaccines undergo such
procedures. - Mod.AS]
