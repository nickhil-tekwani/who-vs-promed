Two weeks ago, health authorities issued an epidemiological alert for the
province of El Oro, and Saturday it was extended to Manabi, Los Rios,
Galapagos, and Guayas. In cases where the symptoms suggest a hantavirus
[etiology], health personnel ought to carry out an investigation to
discount the possibility of infection. In addition, health control
measures [should be carried out] in air, sea, and land terminals, according
to the Undersecretary of Health Region II, Silvio Torres.
Last week there were meetings of epidemiologists of the Ministry [of
Health] and the Pan American Health Organization. The goal was to define
strategies for preventing hantavirus transmission to humans by excreta,
urine, and saliva of infected mice, such as is occurring in Chile.
It would be difficult for an infected mouse to get into Ecuador from Chile
by land [Right, it would have to cross Peru and rodents have very short
legs, although they have four of them. -- Mod CHC], but there is the
possibility that one could arrive by ship, maintained Dr. Keith Carter,
advisor to the Program of Transmissible Diseases of the Pan-American Health
Organization and the World Health Organization.
There are international standards that all ships be certified that they
have cleared of rats because of the possibility of infections such as
plague. Still, it is necessary to be vigilant for patients who present with
respiratory problems. The manager of the Port Authority of Gayaquil,
Nelson Recaurate, said that to enter an Ecuadorian port, there is a
requirement that ships be certified. The certification has a validation of
six months and is part of the routine controls that are carried out at port
terminals.
Carter also advised that there are many diseases that are causing problems
in Ecuador and the general region, diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV,
that should receive attention and a doubling of efforts of prevention. He
went on to say that concern about hantaviruses "can take us down
theoretical roads when there are other old diseases that" that are reemerging.
According to the director of the National Institute of Hygiene, Aracely
Alava, some samples have been tested serologically but all have been
negative for antibody to hantaviruses. The Health Director of Guayas,
Victor Hugo Mite, said that "if the community does not work with us,
neither the authorities nor anyone else can do anything against
hantavirus." He called upon the citizens of Guyas to maintain standards of
hygiene in the collection and disposal of garbage, as well as in keeping
houses free of rodents.
In Peru, although there hasn't been a single case of hantavirus detected,
planes and ships that have come from Chile or Argentina are being
fumigated, but experts from those two countries advised that independently
of the intensity of measures for general sanitation, the disease will
spread to the whole region in the next few years.
The Chilean Minister of Health, called for a South American conference of
experts to discuss and approve common strategies to combat hantavirus in
the region.

[Where to begin? First, I took some liberties while editing this report. I
did not alter the quotes but I took some educated guesses as to what was
meant by some of the text. I hope I have not made it worse. Second, if
any country is looking to another country as the source of a hantavirus,
they may be looking in the wrong place. Hard to believe that an invasion
of rodents would make a hantavirus-free country an infected country.
Indeed, I think this is simply silly and wasteful of time and resources. I
have utmost confidence in Dra. Aracely Alava. If she says a specimen does
not contain antibody to a hantavirus, that's good enough for me. However,
laboratories only receive specimens after the fact. What is needed is
education in a calm environment -- prevention-- not hysteria. -- Mod CHC]
