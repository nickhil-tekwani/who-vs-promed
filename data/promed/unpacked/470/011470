CHOLERA - HAITI (18): UPDATE

The death toll in Haiti's cholera epidemic has reached more than 900,
the government reported Sun 14 Nov 2010, as aid groups rushed soap and
clean water to a disaster-wracked population to fight the disease.

The Ministry of Health reported that as of Fri 12 Nov 2010, there had
been 917 deaths and more than 14 600 were hospitalized with
cholera-like symptoms. That is up from the 724 deaths and 11 125
hospitalizations reported a few days before.

The disease has been found in 6 of Haiti's 10 provinces, known as
departments, and is most severe where it originated, in Artibonite,
which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the deaths.

Several epidemiologists have said the disease has not peaked and will
likely worsen and break out in other regions of the country, with UN
health officials estimating about 270 000 may be eventually sickened.
Several new cholera treatment centers are springing up in the capital
and other areas.

"The trend is increasing and it is propagating from department to
department," Roc Magloire, the Ministry of Health's epidemiologist,
said in a telephone interview on 14 Nov 2010. He referred questions to
the ministry's director general, Gabriel Timothee, who could not be
reached.

Hospitals in Port-au-Prince, where more than one million earthquake
refugees live in congested, squalid tent encampments, are overflowing
with patients exhibiting cholera symptoms, and the death toll there
has reached 27. The disease was first reported in the capital on 8 Nov
2010.

President Rene Preval, at a conference on the disease in
Port-au-Prince, urged people to wash their hands frequently and drink
only potable water, The Associated Press reported. But even before the
earthquake, most of the population lacked access to clean water and
sanitation.

Cholera, [caused by bacteria] that thrive in feces-contaminated water,
causes severe diarrhea and vomiting that can dehydrate and kill its
victims in hours without treatment. The rate of severe cases, about 30
to 40 percent, is far higher in Haiti than the 25 percent in a typical
outbreak because of extreme poverty, unsanitary conditions, and the
fact that cholera has not been there for 40 years.

"When we go around and give advice about hygiene, they say, 'Let me
have soap, I can't afford it,' " said Leonard Doyle, a spokesman for
the International Organization for Migration, an agency that is
distributing water purification tablets and cleaning supplies.

Officials in the neighboring country, the Dominican Republic, say they
are limiting markets on the border and taking other steps to ensure
cholera does not reach that country, where thousands of Haitians live
and work. A suspected case turned out not to be cholera, the country's
health minister said Sun 14 Nov 2010, according to a Dominican
newspaper, Listin Diario, which said the Dominican Republic is
prepared to treat 7500 to 10 000 cholera patients.

[The numbers of cases and the area involved in this rapidly growing
epidemic continue to rise dramatically. There is no reason to doubt
that the numbers predicted will not be reached and probably surpassed.
Additionally, as cholera was introduced into South America 2 decades
ago, the bacterium is likely to continue to produce cases in years to
come. Dominican authorities have stated that the case previously
reported in ProMED-mail was not proven to be cholera but it is just a
matter of time before cases occur in the country which shares the
island of Hispaniola with Haiti. - Mod.LL]
