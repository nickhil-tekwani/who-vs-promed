Plague Detected in Colorado Springs
--------------------------------
The El Paso County Department of Health and Environment has determined that
a tree squirrel has tested positive for plague in the Colorado Springs area.
The Health Department staff has been monitoring the situation for the past
2 weeks in the western side of the city. The area affected is the South and
West border of Garden of the Gods, including the Northeast part of Manitou
Springs.
Now, Health Department staff are informing and educating residents within
the affected area. They are going door to door and handing out pamphlets
that contain information that cautions residents about plague. Health
Department staff has also set up insecticide tubes that will aid in the
control of infected fleas on the local tree squirrel population.
Plague is a bacterial disease of rodents transmitted to humans by the bite
of an infected flea. In humans the symptoms are high fever, chills,
headache, severe prostration, and tender or swollen lymph glands. Health
Department advises residents who experience these symptoms to contact their
physician.
In Colorado, the last reported human case was in a woman from Weld County,
who is fully recovered. In El Paso County, the last reported human case
occurred in 1991.
Don Mydlowski, the Health Department's program manger for animal diseases
that can be transmitted to humans, says "Do not attempt to catch, kill,
feed or handle any type of squirrel, chipmunk or other wild rodent.. Keep
your dogs and cats under control and do not allow them to chase wild
animals. If you live in the affected area, keep cats indoors. Residents
within the affected area should also clear property from trash, lumber
piles, and other areas where animals my live or hide."
If you find a dead squirrel in the affected area please contact the Health
Department at 578-3199.

[Joe, many thanks.
If you must pick up a dead squirrel, use an inverted plastic bag.
For those concerned, the clinical signs in cats include lethargy, anorexia,
and high fever. All 3 forms -- bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic --
usually have all 3 of these signs, and the bubonic form has enlarged lymph
nodes as well (buboes; lymphadenopathy; lymphadenitis), especially in the
submandibular lymph nodes. Some of these may abscess. Both the bubonic and
septicemic forms may also become pneumonic in cats, and this increases the
risk of spread to humans. There may occasionally be oral lesions or
coughing. The following samples should be taken and forwarded to the
relevant diagnostic laboratory: Lymph node aspirate in sterile tube with
saline Whole blood (red top tube); if necropsy: liver, spleen, LN biopsy,
lung (fresh and formalin). - Mod.MHJ]
