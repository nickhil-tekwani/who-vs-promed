A Commentary from Professors Henttonen and Vaheri: Rodent-borne
hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Finland - A changing
epidemiological pattern
-----------------------------------------------
Most cases of rodent-borne hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome
(HFRS) in Europe are caused by Puumala hantavirus (PUUV). This mild
form of HFRS is often called nephropathia epidemica (NE). The virus
and its carrier host, the bank vole (_Clethrionomys glareolus_, in
the very latest taxonomy suggested to be _Myodes glareolus_) are
prevalent in most of Europe except the northernmost areas and
Mediterranean coastal regions. NE incidence is much higher in
Northern Europe than in the west and south, primarily due to the
pronounced population cycles of the carrier voles in the north. The
incidence is highest in Finland, and on the average, about 5 percent
of Finns are seropositive to PUUV. Although yellow-necked mouse
_Apodemus flavicollis_ and striped field mouse _A. agrarius_ are
found in southern Finland, and known to carry Dobrava and Saaremaa
hantaviruses elsewhere in Europe, only PUUV is a known to cause HFRS
in Finland. The human epidemiology of NE follows the local vole
cycle, i.e. human cases occur in the same rhythm as the rodent cycles.
NE is a notifiable disease in Finland. According to national
statistics, a drastic change in the human epidemiology has been seen
recently. Since the late 1980s until the late 1990s, there were
around 1000 (800-1100) human cases annually in Finland, and the
yearly variation was not large at the national scale. However, a
change took place in 1999, when a record 2305 cases was reached; in
2002, a new record of 2603; and in 2005, 2524 human cases were
diagnosed. In addition, the numbers of human cases have been higher
than earlier in the between-peak years. The Finnish population is 5.2
million, and 2600 cases means an incidence of 50 / 100 000 in the
peak years. For comparison, the same incidence rate would cause
nearly 150 000 human cases in the U.S. Fortunately, European NE is a
much milder disease than HPS [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
associated predominantly with Sin Nombre virus - Mod.CP] in the
Americas, with a case fatality rate of 0.1 percent or less in Finland
vs. more than 30 percent in the U.S.
There are 2 clear trends in the Finnish data. The long-term
increasing trend is apparently based on better awareness and
diagnostics of the disease. The increasing trend is also clear in
local data sets and in between-peak years. However, the most
important feature is that the human epidemiology has changed from a
rather stable national multi-annual pattern to a strongly cyclic one.
The change in NE dynamics is obviously due to the change in the
geographic synchrony of vole fluctuations in Finland. In the southern
half on Finland, where most people live and most human NE data come
from, a vole cycle usually lasts for 3 years, though 4-year cycles
are also known. Vole cycles are monitored by the Finnish Forest
Research Institute, e.g. to predict the damage risk by rodents in
forestry plantations. From the 1970s until the late 1990s, the
geographic coverage of a vole peak was not as extensive as it is
presently. For example, earlier, a vole peak occurred simultaneously
in western and south-central Finland, and a year later in
southeastern Finland. In the late 1990s, a change in geographic
synchrony took place, and since then, the vole peak has occurred in
the same year through most of the southern half of Finland from the
western coast to the eastern border. As a result, the number of human
cases that earlier were dispersed over 2 or 3 years in geographically
different areas now occur in the same year in the whole area. The
reason for this geographic change in the synchrony of vole cycles is
not well known, but changes like this have taken place earlier and
may therefore not be related to any present sudden environmental change.
The bank vole densities were very high in Finland in autumn 2005,
higher than in 2002, and seroprevalence in bank voles was commonly
20-40 percent (and based on our ongoing studies, most seropositive
voles have viral RNA). Therefore, we expected a new record in human
NE numbers in 2005. However, the numbers remained at the same level
as in 2002. This might have been because the autumn was exceptionally
warm and the autumnal movements of bank voles to human settlements
were probably delayed. Consequently, also the seasonal peak in human
NE incidence was delayed from late autumn to mid-winter, and over to
early 2006. Bank vole numbers were also high on coastal regions in
southern and southwestern Finland, resulting in 4-5 times more NE
cases than normally in these regions, where NE usually is not common.
Larger than usual increases in cases of hantavirus (PUUV) infections
in Belgium, France and Germany were also observed in 2005 (see
ProMED-mail post archived as "Hantavirus - Belgium, France & Germany
20050722.2108", and EuroSurveillance 10:198-200, 21 Jul 2005), and
for laymen it would be tempting to look for common reasons. However,
we emphasize that the causes of cycles/outbreaks of forest rodents in
central and northern Europe are different. The northern European vole
cycle in the boreal environment is to a great extent a predator-prey
cycle, while the outbreaks of forest rodents in temperate Europe are
due to masting (good seed crops of deciduous forest trees). It is
also noteworthy that even though Belgium, France and Germany had
their record numbers in 2005, these numbers, both the total and
especially the incidence, were still much lower than those in
Finland, even in low years.

[ProMED-mail is grateful to Professors Henttonen and Vaheri for
providing this update on the disease situation relating to
nephropathica epidemica (NE) and the ecological factors responsible
for the increasing prevalence of NE in the human population in
Finland at the present time.
A general description of hantaviruses can be accessed at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hanta/hps/noframes/phys/technicalinfoindex.htm>.
The genus _Hantavirus_ is one of the 5 genera comprising the family
_Bunyaviridae_, a group of negative-stranded RNA viruses with
tripartite genomes. The hosts of hantaviruses are primarily rodents,
and genetically distinct hantaviruses are usually associated with a
single rodent species. Hantaviruses cause persistent non-pathogenic
infections of their rodent hosts. Human infection is incidental to
viral survival and is almost always a dead end in the infection
chain. Unlike viruses of the other genera of the family
_Bunyaviridae_, the hantaviruses are not transmitted by arthropods. - Mod.CP]
