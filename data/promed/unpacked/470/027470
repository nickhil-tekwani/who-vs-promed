Many pigs are dying in farms, pigpens and other places in the north-western region because of a strange disease that affects the immunological system of these animals, and breeders are becoming concerned about this occurrence.

After the first reports of this condition, sales of pork have fallen down in butcher shops, markets, supermarkets and other stores in Dajabon Province, where it was reported that more than 100 animals died.

Most of the cases of this disease have been reported in Carbonera and Copey in Dajabon Province, as well as in Manzanillo Municipality in Montecristi Province.

Mr. Ausberto Rodriguez-Sanchez, officer in charge of the Farming Department in Dajabon, believes this disease comes from Haiti. "We suspect this disease is enteroviral swine encephalitis (terchen)", he explained.

Nevertheless, the officer pointed out they are waiting for the results of tests sent to a laboratory in Santo Domingo.

According to breeders, pigs affected by this disease start shaking and then they fall down, stop eating and die soon afterwards.

'I lost 14 pigs because of this disease. I had these animals for sale and pay for my children's education' expressed Mr. Yameris Rosado, from Carbonera community.

[This sounds a bit like Porcine Enteroviral Encephalomyelitis: (Teschen disease)

Until recently, viruses causing this disease were classified within the genus Enterovirus (family Picornaviridae). However, analyses of their complete genome sequences have revealed them to be very different from the enteroviruses, and they have been reclassified in a new genus, Teschovirus, as the species porcine teschovirus (PTV, derived from Teschen disease).

Transmission is by direct or indirect contact with infected pigs. The virulent serotype 1 strain of classic Teschen disease results in high morbidity and mortality in all ages of pigs but apparently has remained confined to certain geographic areas. Mild, sporadic disease is seen elsewhere. Conventional herds are usually endemically infected, and exclusion of teschoviruses from SPF herds is difficult to maintain. Infection is mainly inapparent, and pigs usually become infected at weaning with the decline of passive maternal immunity and mixing of groups. Sporadic clinical cases of nervous disease are seen mainly around this time, although disease is more common in unweaned piglets after introduction of a serotype to which the herd has not been exposed.

Ingested virus replicates in the GI tract and associated lymphoid tissue. There is no destruction of gut epithelium, but virus is shed from multiplication sites into the feces for several weeks. In some pigs, especially those infected with virulent strains, viremia ensues and results in spread of infection to the CNS

In acute virulent infection, clinical signs appear 1-4 wk after exposure in pigs of all ages. Ataxia is often seen first, followed by fever, lassitude, and anorexia. Seizures, nystagmus, opisthotonos, and coma may occur. Paralysis, initially evident as paraplegia but progressing to quadriplegia, is frequent in severe cases. Death is common within 3-4 days of onset of signs.

In mild disease, signs are essentially ataxia and paresis, the latter more rarely progressing to paralysis. Only young pigs (unweaned or weaned) are susceptible, and recovery is frequent.

The clinical signs (especially those of locomotor disturbance), epidemiology, and absence of specific gross necropsy findings offer a presumptive diagnosis. The nature and distribution of histologic lesions provide supportive evidence. Acute and convalescent serum samples, taken more than 2 weeks apart, may demonstrate a rise in neutralizing or complement-fixing antibodies. Virus isolation from the CNS is required to confirm the diagnosis. Differentiation of severe and milder forms of the disease can be based only on serologic, clinical, and epidemiologic evidence.

Differential diagnoses include the many other viral encephalitides of pigs, particularly classical swine fever, African swine fever, pseudorabies, rabies, and the encephalopathies of edema disease and water deprivation/salt intoxication. The prominent locomotor signs in porcine enteroviral encephalomyelitis also can be confused with several toxic and nutritional neuropathies.

The different serotypes are identified either by virus neutralization, complement fixation, or ELISA using specific antisera. With the recent availability of genome sequence data for all the PTV serotypes, molecular diagnosis is a possibility; however, no validated protocols are currently available.

There is no treatment. Live attenuated vaccine is used for control in areas experiencing severe endemic disease. In the past, eradication measures in central Europe involved ring vaccination and slaughter, and restrictions on importation of pigs and pork products. In many countries, suspected disease must be reported to regulatory authorities. In herds with endemic mild clinical disease, introduction of new breeding stock at least or more than 1 mo before breeding should enhance passive immunity in offspring.
