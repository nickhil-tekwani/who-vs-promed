Queensland police have raided an Inghams poultry research laboratory as
part of an investigation into the New South Wales (NSW) outbreak of the
deadly Newcastle disease. The Herald understands the police called in
computer experts to help retrieve information held on Inghams computers. It
is understood the police seized documents and cultured samples from Inghams
Enterprises laboratories and took them away for analysis.
The outbreak of Newcastle disease at Mangrove Mountain in April has been
the worst in Australia's agricultural history and has led to the slaughter
of 1.9 million commercial chickens and thousands of domestic birds and
pets, and the poisoning of wild birds in an attempt to contain it.
The Herald understands the police investigation is centered on how a farmer
growing chickens on behalf of Inghams lost 20,000 birds on his farm at
Mangrove Mountain several months before the disease was officially
discovered on April 1. It will also investigate why neither the farmer nor
Inghams reported those deaths to the Department of Agriculture.
Earlier this month the investigators dug up rotting chicken carcasses from
the farm but it is understood scientists were unable to determine what
killed them.
Strange and large deaths of poultry must be reported to the authorities
under the Exotic Diseases of Animals Act, according to a NSW Agriculture
spokesman.
