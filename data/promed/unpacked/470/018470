Avoiding New York and boiling your suitcase might not be enough for
Londoners to dodge the global bedbug pandemic -- they are probably
already in a hotel, house, or cinema nearby.

Apple seed-sized, flat, brownish bedbugs -- also known as _Cimicidae_
-- were once rife all over the world but had been largely wiped out by
the banned pesticide DDT. But like head lice, they have been mounting
a comeback during the past few decades, pest control firms say.
Wrongly linked to poverty or poor hygiene, today's jet-setting bedbugs
travel on all airline classes in luggage, aircraft seats, and clothes
to wherever people sleep or rest.

This week [week of 7 Feb 2011] there were more than 42 000 references
to bedbugs on customer feedback travel website
<http://www.tripadvisor.com> and British pest control firm Rentokil
Plc said there has been a 24 per cent increase in bedbug jobs over the
past year in Britain. "Bedbugs are a worldwide and growing problem,"
Rentokil technical director Savvas Othon told Reuters. "People carry
bedbugs unknowingly in clothes and bags."

Pest controller Mark Astley said the problem in London encouraged him
to switch careers from IT consultant and he has seen such a surge in
demand that he has acquired a dog trained to sniff out bedbugs in
order to speed detection. Mr Astley's canine scent-detection company,
Trust K9, runs seminars on bedbug management for hoteliers. He says
the bugs hide in bed frames, headboards, skirting, wall and ceiling
cracks, behind light switches, and can drop on you from the ceiling.
But they do not like smooth surfaces so if you sleep in a hotel bath
or keep your luggage there you might be all right. Mr Astley uses
Lola, a 2 year old Parson's Jack Russell terrier, to detect bugs and
then pumps hot air into affected rooms, which kills live bugs and eggs
within hours.

Bedbugs seem to trigger a more primal response of revulsion than
fleas or head lice, although they are not disease carriers, perhaps
because they feed when we are most vulnerable. "Your inner, inner
sanctum has been invaded by a pest which can eat 10 times its
bodyweight in your blood when you're deeply asleep in the middle of
the night," he said.

Lola will perform a relentless search for bedbugs on the command
"find the bees", but even the average person can detect a serious
infestation. It smells sweetish, like almonds, while black spots like
felt tip marker dots on furniture can also be a sign, as well as blood
spots on bedding, carpets, and walls. "I saw an apartment this week
where there were blood spots and bugs on the bed frame and against the
wall and carpet," Mr Astley said. "It looked like someone had
scattered thousands of Rice Krispies -- pupae skins and bugs
everywhere. I even saw them walking across the forehead of a man I was
talking to."

Mr Astley said travellers who bring soft luggage abroad could tumble
dry it on high heat for 20 minutes after a trip to kill bugs in the
luggage, but it was still not easy to prevent being bitten abroad or
avoid bringing the bugs home. "I'd recently treated and swept a large
central London hotel and as we walked through the lobby Lola alerted
and started scratching at a departing guest's luggage," he said.

[[Bedbugs are wingless, blood-sucking insects. They are flat, oval,
reddish brown, about 5-7 mm in length, and turn purplish after feeding
(for pictures, see
<http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1088931-overview>). Bedbug
infestations are common worldwide, including North America and Europe,
and seem to be increasing around the world at an alarming rate (Hwang
SW, Svoboda TJ, De Jong IJ, et al: Bed bug infestations in an urban
environment. Emerg Infect Dis (serial on the Internet). 2005 Apr (date
cited); available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol11no04/04-1126.htm>). The reasons
for this resurgence are unknown, but are thought to be due to
increasing world travel, reluctance to use some insecticides because
of concerns regarding toxicity, and resistance to other insecticides,
such as pyrethroids.

Although bedbug infestation is thought to be a problem of poverty,
unsanitary living conditions, and overcrowding, a study of the extent
of the problem in Toronto, Canada documented bedbug infestations in
single-family dwellings as well as in homeless shelters and other
communal living settings
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol11no04/04-1126.htm#table1>).

Bedbugs are transported from infested to non-infested areas on
clothing, luggage, furniture, or bedding. Bedbugs possess stink glands
and emit an odor. Homes heavily infested with the bugs have a distinct
odor that dogs can be trained to detect.

The bedbug's name comes from its preferred habitat that includes
mattresses, sofas, and other furniture. Bedbugs hide in the seams and
folds of upholstery and cracks and crevices in beds, wooden furniture,
floorboards, and walls during the daytime and emerge at night to feed
on humans, attracted to body heat, carbon dioxide, vibration, sweat,
and odor. In some persons the bite is nearly undetectable. However,
repeated bites may sensitize individuals to bedbug antigens, leading
to more pronounced cutaneous manifestations, usually small clusters of
extremely pruritic, erythematous papules, or systemic hypersensitivity
reactions, including rarely anaphylaxis. Scratching of the bite can
lead to secondary bacterial infection. Most bedbug bite reactions are
self-limited and require little specific treatment other than
corticosteroid creams and oral antihistamines for local allergic
reactions and antiseptic or antibiotic creams for secondary
infections.

The life span of a bedbug is about 10 months, during which they may
bite more than one individual and could possibly serve as a vector for
transmission of a blood borne pathogen from one individual to another.
Nevertheless, bedbugs have never been shown to transmit disease.
Hepatitis C virus RNA has not been detected in bedbugs at any time
after feeding. Although hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA has been detected
in bedbugs and excrement up to 6 wk after feeding on an infectious
meal (<http://www.uptodate.com/contents/bedbugs/abstract/17>) and
hepatitis B surface antigen has been shown to persist in bedbugs for
at least 7.5 weeks after experimental feeding (Jupp PG, McElligott SE:
Transmission experiments with hepatitis B surface antigen and the
common bedbug (_Cimex lectularius_ L). S Afr Med J. 1979; 56: 54-7;
available at
<http://archive.samj.org.za/1979%20VOL%20LVI%20Jul-Dec/Articles/01%20July/2.6%20TRANSMISSION%20EXPERIMENTS%20WITH%20HEPATITIS%20B%20SURFACE%20ANTIGEN%20AND%20THE%20COMMON%20BEDBUG%20(CIMEX%20LECTUL.pdf>),
no infections or seroconversions resulted in 3 chimpanzees on which
HBV-positive bedbugs were fed (Jupp PG, Purcell RH, Phillips JM, et
al: Attempts to transmit hepatitis B virus to chimpanzees by
arthropods. S Afr Med J. 1991; 79: 320-2; available at
<http://archive.samj.org.za/1991%20VOL%2079%20Jan-Jun/Articles/03%20March/2.10%20ATTEMPTS%20TO%20TRANSMIT%20HEPATITIS%20B%20VIRUS%20TO%20CHIMPANZEES%20BY%20ARTHROPODS.%20P.G.%20Jupp,%20R.H.%20Purcell.pdf>).

Similarly, HIV could be detected in bedbugs up to 8 days after
exposure to highly concentrated virus in blood meals, but no viral
replication was observed, nor was any virus detected in bedbug feces;
and, by using an artificial system of feeding bedbugs through
membranes, the authors of this study could not demonstrate mechanical
transmission of HIV and believed that the risk of insect transmission
of HIV is extremely low or nonexistent (Webb PA, Happ CM, Maupin GO,
et al: Potential for insect transmission of HIV: experimental exposure
of _Cimex hemipterus_ and _Toxorhynchites amboinensis_ to human
immunodeficiency virus. J Infect Dis. 1989; 160: 970-7; available at
<http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/160/6/970.long>).
