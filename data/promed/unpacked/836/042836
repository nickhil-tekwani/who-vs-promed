We would appreciate your posting the following WHO update on the
ongoing investigation of deaths following Euvax B (hepatitis B)
vaccination and with specific reference to 2 press articles posted on
the ProMED Digest website on 25 May 2007 (see below) and
<http://pro-med.blogspot.com/2007/05/pro-promed-digest-v2007-252.html>.
WHO update on deaths following Euvax B (hepatitis B) vaccination:
The articles posted on the ProMED Digest website on 25 May 2007
entitled "Hepatitis B vaccine-associated deaths - Multicountry:
susp." and "WHO probing more cases of vaccine-related child deaths"
mentions 2 deaths in the Philippines and one death in Bangladesh
following Euvax B (hepatitis B) vaccination.
All information to date indicates that the reference to these alleged
deaths in the original press article was due to a misquote. A media
update has been issued to all press in Viet Nam to correct this
misquote. WHO has not been able to confirm those rumors of alleged
deaths following Euvax B vaccination in Bangladesh and the Philippines.
WHO is currently investigating the reports of deaths and serious
adverse events in Viet Nam following Euvax B vaccination. WHO is also
investigating all alleged reports of deaths and serious adverse
events following Euvax B vaccination in other countries. In addition,
WHO is conducting a vaccine quality review, including a review of the
batch records of relevant vaccine lots and the manufacturing and
quality control process of the Euvax B vaccine produced by LG Life
Science, Republic of Korea.
It is important to stress that none of the information to date
suggests a vaccine quality problem with specific lots of Euvax B or
with the vaccine in general. Furthermore, the information to date
does not provide evidence of a causal link between the deaths under
investigation and Euvax B vaccine. It is important to note that
deaths in this age group, reportedly following vaccination, may be
coincidental, that is, having only a temporal association with the
vaccine(s) administered.
As a precautionary measure, and pending the outcome of ongoing
investigations, WHO has temporarily suspended use of specific bulk
batches and final lots of Euvax B vaccine; this information has been
communicated to national authorities. WHO is recommending the
continued use of other Euvax B vaccine lots not affected by the
temporary suspension.
WHO reiterates that hepatitis B vaccine is highly effective in
preventing hepatitis B virus infection and its long-term
consequences. WHO recommends that all infants in all countries
receive hepatitis B vaccine, with the 1st dose provided at birth in
areas where mother-to-child hepatitis B virus transmission is important.

[The information in the preceding reports was reported in good faith,
and ProMED-mail regrets the inaccuracy. ProMED-mail welcomes the
opportunity to make this correction. - Mod.CP]
[ProMED-mail would like to thank WHO for the above given
clarification of the current situation. As local media are frequently
the 1st public source of information on unusual health events,
ProMED-mail frequently posts such information, often with moderator
comments requesting more information from knowledgeable sources.
Fortunately, the media is more often than not fairly reliable, and
correction postings haven't been routinely necessary. From the above
comments, it appears as though the media reports on the supposed
deaths following receipt of the questionable lots of Euvax B vaccine
in Bangladesh and the Philippines have not been substantiated nor
have other reports from other countries that have received the lots
in question. Of note, in one of today's media reports from Viet Nam (see
<http://www.thanhniennews.com/healthy/?catid=8&newsid=28497>)
there is mention of a 4th death following vaccination, but with a
different batch of hepatitis B vaccine (a "domestically produced
vaccine") and receipt of other childhood vaccines. The newswire also
makes reference to deaths in other countries. Apparently, the media
are still having a "feeding frenzy" with respect to possible
vaccine-associated deaths in Viet Nam. As mentioned in the prior
posting: "While it is unclear if there is a definite causal
association between the deaths and the receipt of the vaccine, it is
prudent that the lots of vaccine involved be withheld from
administration. What is also unclear is whether there has been active
case finding in all of the 24 countries that received vaccine from
the suspected lots." - Mod.MPP]
