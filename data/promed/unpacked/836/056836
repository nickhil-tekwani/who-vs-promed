The number of dengue cases nationwide has doubled in the 1st 5 weeks of the
year [2009] compared with the same period last year [2008]. And Selangor
still has the highest number. By 6 Feb [2009], some 6623 cases had been
recorded and 18 people had died. In the same period last year [2008] the
numbers were 3829 cases and 9 deaths.

These worrying numbers have given rise to concern for Selangor,
particularly Hulu Langat district, which has 15 of the 40 hotspots
identified in the state. Last year [2008] Selangor recorded 21 262 cases,
almost half of the 49 335 cases nationwide.

Speaking at an anti-dengue campaign at Taman Taming Jaya in Balakong
yesterday [7 Feb 2009], health minister Datuk Liow Tiong Lai said although
Selangor has shown an increase when compared with last year [2008], since
December the number of cases has dropped by 38 per cent. "Although we are
dealing with worrying numbers overall, this is an encouraging trend. People
need to be quicker in consulting a doctor when they have symptoms. Many
people delay treatment," Liow said. Only 35 per cent of people nationwide
are diagnosed with dengue inside 3 days.

He said the ministry has registered 11 892 volunteers in its Communication
for Behavioural Impact (Combi) programme launched last year [2008]. It is
aimed at turning awareness into community action against dengue. They have
been sent to 585 locations around the country. "We need help from local
councils and residents associations as well. If we had enough machines we
could fog all areas on a weekly basis. But we don't have sufficient
machines or manpower," he said.

Liow said more volunteer groups are needed to combat the disease. The
ministry is willing to support them financially, and help them to acquire
fogging machines and training in their use.

The residents of Taman Taming Jaya, where one person has died of dengue,
had organised a gotong-royong [joint responsibility and mutual cooperation.
- Mod.TY] and launched their "10 Minutes a Week -- Destroy _Aedes_ and
Combat Dengue" campaign. The idea is that volunteers from secondary schools
and non-governmental organisations in the area spend a short time each week
cleaning up the neighbourhood.

Some 6240 dengue cases and 16 deaths were recorded up to 4 February this
year [2009], a 55 per cent increase compared with 3407 cases and 9 deaths
recorded in the same period last year [2008], health minister Datuk Liow
Tiong Lai said. However, on a weekly basis, however, the number showed a
decrease, he added.

"A total of 1013 cases with 2 deaths were recorded in the 4th week [2009],
or a 37 per cent drop compared with 1633 cases and 4 deaths in the 1st week
[2009]. There were 1578 cases and 4 deaths recorded in the 2nd week and
1310 cases with 5 deaths in the 3rd week," he stated.

Of the total, 3835 cases and 10 deaths were in the Klang Valley. Liow said
13 of the 54 dengue hotspots identified last month [January 2009] were now
free of the disease. However, dengue had erupted in 3 new localities,
bringing the total number of dengue hotspots to 44 -- 40 in Selangor, 3 in
Kuala Lumpur, and one in Terengganu.

The minister said the ministry was targeting to reduce the number of dengue
cases by 10 000 this year [2009]. Last year [2008], Malaysia recorded about
49 300 cases. He said 94 chikungunya cases were reported nationwide between
[25-31 Jan 2009].

state, as dengue hot spots. Of the reported cases, 161 have been confirmed
with one case of DHF (dengue hemorrhagic fever). Shah Alam City Council
officials have inspected 3252 places, including residential premises,
commercial areas, schools, factories, kindergartens, construction sites,
abandoned housing projects, playgrounds, and other recreational spots
throughout the city. They found _Aedes_ mosquito breeding sites at 240
premises and had issued 137 summonses, which carries a fine of RM 500 [USD

The Public Health Ministry has set up a national war room to control the
spread of dengue fever across the country after learning the situation will
be far worse than last year [2008]. So far, 1675 people have fallen victim
to the fever this year [2009], said the minister, Witthaya Kaewparadai.

The ministry's deputy permanent secretary, Dr Paijit Warachit will chair
the war room, teaming up with agencies including the Bangkok Metropolitan
Administration's Health Department, the World Health Organisation (WHO),
and a joint activity of the Ministry of Public Health of Thailand and the
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to monitor the spread
of disease within Thailand and neighbouring countries. They will meet at
least once a week to keep a close watch on any possible outbreak.

Witthaya added he has assigned all provincial public health offices, local
administration organisations, and health volunteers to strictly control and
monitor the transmission of dengue fever in local areas. Local authorities
have been advised to spray insecticide to eradicate the adult _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquito, which bites humans in the daytime. Residents should
drain off any stagnant water to prevent mosquitoes from breeding and use
abates sand, a pesticide, to destroy their larvae.

Citing Bureau of Epidemiology records, Paijit said in January [2009], 1675
people had been infected with dengue fever and 2 had died. The figure for
the same period last year [2008] was 1553 dengue fever cases reported and 2
lives lost. The Central region was the hardest hit with 886 patients, the
Southern region suffered the 2nd worst outbreak with 546 patients and
Bangkok, 303. Songkhla, Pattani, and Yala were the worst affected
provinces. Nearly half the patients this year [2009] were over 15 years old.

Last year [2008] saw a total of 91 003 patients, with 65 581 cases in 2007.

A dengue fever outbreak killed one person and infected 26 others in Mamuju
District, West Sulawesi Province, a local health official said.

The Mamuju health office declared the disease outbreak in the district as
an "extraordinary happening" [emergency] to anticipate the spreading of
dengue fever, Firmon, the Mamuju health service head, said [in Mamuju] on
Saturday [7 Feb 2009]. The 26 patients of dengue fever were currently being
hospitalized in Mamuju Public Hospital, he said.

The health office has distributed powder to kill the eggs of _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquitoes, which are usually laid on the surface of stagnant
water, and sprayed mosquito repellent, he said. The local health office
also set up 27 command posts in every community health center and hospitals
in the district to monitor the disease outbreak.

During January 2009, 102 cases of dengue fever occurred in the Pacitan
Regency, East Java, so as to cause the Health Service to declare a dengue
fever emergency ("extraordinary incident"), said the head of Disease
Control, Environment and Sanitation of Pacitan, Hendra Purwaka, on Tuesday
[3 Feb 2009]. The dengue attack this time has experienced a change in the
pattern." [he said] "The Health Service found inconsistency," shock to the
sufferer which usually happens on day 5-7, but this time it was earlier,
that is day 3-5.

So he made a plea to the wider community to be more on the alert with the
change in the pattern of this attack of dengue fever. He said, the high
number of dengue cases was also caused because of the lack of social
involvement by the community to be aware of the need for environmental
sanitation that ought to be carried out constantly and earlier, before the
rainy season.

To anticipate increase in cases, the Pacitan Health Service will carry out
monitoring activity and fumigation in the endemic territory where the
illness is spreading. Moreover, there will be eradication of the mosquito
breeding sites using the "3M" approach with drained [water catchments],
closed [water storage containers], buried trash to combat mosquitoes.
Moreover, the efforts were to be carried out periodically in areas of all
the social strata.

Health authorities in far north Queensland say there is a danger dengue
fever could spread through Port Douglas, north of Cairns, after its 1st
case was confirmed today [6 Feb 2009]. There have been 277 confirmed cases
in Cairns and 47 in Townsville.

Entomologist Brian Montgomery says people need to take precautions to stop
the spread of the disease. "We've had dengue outbreaks before in Port
Douglas so there's certainly a risk that it will spread," he said. "They
have a very pro-active program with assessing hotspots there, so it's
always encouraging if the public are well educated."

Travelers arriving at Cairns airport should be screened for dengue fever,
an infectious disease specialist said yesterday [6 Feb 2009]. As health
authorities battle the fastest spreading outbreak ever seen, James Cook
University medicine professor James McBride said the Government should
consider installing a thermal scanner to identify dengue fever cases. "If
we can identify everybody that came into the country with dengue [virus],
then we wouldn't have epidemics," professor McBride said.

The clinical microbiologist said although the technology would not stop all
dengue fever outbreaks, it had the potential to reduce the incidence of the
virus. The federal Government last night [6 Feb 2009] dismissed the
suggestion, despite having 25 unused portable scanners purchased in
response to the threat of pandemic influenza, saying current screening was
sufficient.

Cases of the mosquitoborne disease have skyrocketed: last night [6 Feb
2009] there were 279 in Cairns and 49 in Townsville, compared with 170 in
Cairns and 9 in Townsville just a fortnight ago. The potentially fatal
disease also spread to the tourist town of Port Douglas, north of Cairns,
last night with one confirmed case.

Professor McBride said the scanners would identify travellers who had
fevers, one of the main symptoms of dengue fever. The current Cairns
epidemic was started by a traveller from Indonesia. Professor McBride said
12 people with dengue arrived in north Queensland every year.

Taiwan, China, and Hong Kong scan travellers and Canada did so during the
SARS outbreak from late 2002 to mid 2003.

Scott Ritchie, director of medical entomology at Tropical Population Health
Services in Cairns, said the current dengue virus was the most rapidly
moving he had seen. Dr Ritchie said the transmission rate for this form of
virus was as short as 9 days, compared with 17 days during the 2003
outbreak. He said the virus could not be eradicated until winter, when it
would be too dry and too cold for mosquitoes to breed and the virus to spread.

Mosquitoborne dengue fever is spreading once again in the Colombo city
limit area with sharp increase in the number of patients, Sri Lanka health
officials today said [5 Feb 2009]. Dr Pradeep Kariyawasam, the chief
medical officer of the Colombo Municipal Council confirmed that 113 dengue
cases have been reported within Colombo city limits during last month
[January 2009]. According to the health sources, 2 children have already
died in the same period due to dengue fever.

Most dengue cases have been reported from Mattakkuliya, Modara, Hulftsdrop,
Borella, and Slave Island areas, Dr Kariyawasam said. Health officials
urged the people in Colombo city limits to destroy the mosquito
breeding-grounds to prevent the spreading of the disease.

In New Caledonia, about 500 new cases of dengue fever have been detected
this year [2009], prompting local authorities to label the outbreak an
epidemic. Health and social department authorities say they are worried by
the rapidly rising incidence of the disease, and say there have been 100
new cases in the past week alone [week of 1 Feb 2009]. Hotspots for the
epidemic include the capital, Noumea and its surrounding area, as well as
the southern part of the main island.

Health authorities have reported the official registration of 2 cases of
dengue [virus] type 4. French Polynesia had been so far spared from the
epidemic that has been raging since mid-2008 in several regions of the
South Pacific. The anti-vector effort is to be strengthened. In particular,
people have been asked to eliminate mosquito-breeding sites.
