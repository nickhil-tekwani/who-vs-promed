_Wheat streak mosaic virus_ in southern Illinois
------------------------------------------------
Wheat streak mosaic virus has been confirmed in southern Illinois,
says Carl Bradley, University of Illinois Extension, noting that he
has received several reports of similar symptoms in wheat fields
across the state. "Infection likely occurred last fall [2010]," says
Bradley.

Symptoms of wheat streak mosaic could easily be confused with another
disease known as bacterial mosaic, caused by the bacterial pathogen
_Clavibacter michiganense_ subsp. _tessellarius_. Bradley says
bacterial mosaic has been observed in Illinois in past seasons, but no
confirmations of that disease have been reported for 2011.

Bradley reminds producers that the only way virus diseases can be
properly diagnosed is by a laboratory that can run specific tests
using ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) or PCR (polymerase
chain reaction). As part of a funded research project, Bradley's
laboratory is conducting a wheat virus survey for Illinois.

[_Wheat streak mosaic virus_ (WSMV; genus _Tritimovirus_) can infect
wheat, maize (some cultivars), grasses, and also oats and barley in
experimental inoculations. Heavy WSMV infection can cause complete
crop failure in wheat. Symptoms usually appear in warmer weather and
may include yellow blotches, streaks, and mottling on leaves as well
as severe stunting, excessive tillering, and possibly death of
plants.

WSMV is spread by the wheat curl mite _Aceria tulipae_. Larvae
acquire the virus by feeding on infected plants and remain infectious
for approximately a week. Field distribution of symptoms is closely
related to the dispersal of the vector, for example, margins of fields
are often affected first. The virus is not transmitted congenitally to
the progeny of the vector. WSMV can also be mechanically transmitted
and seed transmitted at a low level. Control of the mite vector is
difficult but disease management may include controlling volunteer
wheat and grassy weeds to minimise inoculum from the previous season
via a 'green bridge'.

Bacterial mosaic of wheat, also mentioned above, is characterised
mainly by foliar mosaic symptoms, which may be widespread (see links
below for further information).
