Ontario: Second West Nile virus-positive bird confirmed
-------------------------------------------------------
A dead crow from Oxford County has tested positive for West Nile virus. The
bird was found in Woodstock on 4 Jun 2002. No West Nile virus-positive
birds were found in Oxford County during the 2001 season.
The first West Nile virus-positive bird found in Ontario in 2002 was
collected on 19 May 2002 in Peel Region.
Last year was the first year that West Nile virus was found in Canada. In
2001, 128 birds in southern Ontario were found and confirmed to have been
carrying the virus. The first of those dead birds turned up on 8 Aug 2001,
more than 2-1/2 months later than this year's first reported case.
