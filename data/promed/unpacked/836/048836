Summary of new viruses this week:
- Afghanistan: 1 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) positive environmental sample.
- Pakistan: 4 WPV1 positive environmental samples.
- Papua New Guinea: 1 case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1).
- Nigeria: 2 cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) and 7 cVDPV2 positive environmental samples.

As the year [2018] draws to a close, endemic and outbreak countries are making concerted efforts to eradicate the last strong holds of polio, by conducting large-scale immunization activities before the end of the year.

[Comments from the GPEI re: approaching eradication]
- Nominal variations (up or down) in the number of newly-reported cases at this point of the polio endgame -- although tragic for the affected children and their families -- are not operationally overwhelming, especially considering the population size in the 3 remaining endemic countries (upwards of 90 million children aged less than 5 years). However, confirmation of even a single polio case anywhere points to remaining vaccination coverage gaps which must be filled, to achieve eradication.
- Over and beyond case numbers, the GPEI and its partners actively and continuously evaluate a wide range of epidemiological, virological, programmatic, operational, surveillance, financial, and social data, the analysis of which drives strategic planning and enables target eradication efforts.
- The 3 remaining endemic countries continue to intensify their eradication efforts, through implementation of national polio emergency action plans. Underpinning these plans is the data analysis, to identify area-specific challenges and reasons why children are being missed (that is, due to population movement, inaccessibility, lack of infrastructure, inadequate microplanning, resistance, etc.), and putting in place area-specific solutions to overcome those reasons. By clearly identifying high risk areas, teams are able to allocate and prioritise technical assistance to those areas.
- Analysis in 2018 by both GPEI partners and independent technical advisory groups, reviewing all available evidence, concludes that the near-term feasibility of eradication is possible, if remaining vaccination coverage gaps are rapidly filled, and the GPEI and its partners continue to work towards this goal.
- The aim is to urgently interrupt the remaining strains of wild poliovirus transmission, not only to eradicate such strains in their own right and prevent their global re-emergence, but also to subsequently remove oral polio vaccines (OPV) from routine immunization programmes globally, to eliminate the long-term risks of vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs).
- The ultimate aim of the GPEI is to secure and sustain a world where no child will ever again be paralysed by any poliovirus -- be it wild or vaccine-derived.

Afghanistan
- No cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) have been reported this week. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 is 19.
- 1 WPV1 positive environmental sample was reported this week from Jalalabad district, Nangarhar province, collected on [24 Oct 2018].

Pakistan
- No cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) have been reported this week. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 in the country now stands at 8.
- 4 WPV1 positive environmental samples have been reported across Pakistan: 1 in Quetta district, Balochistan province, 1 each in Nowshera and Peshawar districts, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, and 1 in Lahore district, Punjab province, collection dates ranging from [11-24 Oct 2018].
- It is important to note that cases are reported this year [2018] from only 4 districts across the country, and that no WPV cases (except 1 from Gadap, greater Karachi) have been reported from core reservoir areas in 2018. 20 years ago, the entirely country was affected by polio, and every year, more than 35 000 children were paralyzed for life by the disease.

Nigeria
- 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases were reported this week, 1 from Katsina state and 1 from Kaduna state (newly infected district and province, part of the Jigawa outbreak) with onset of paralysis on [9 Oct 2018] and [10 Sep 2018] respectively.
- No cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported. The most recently-detected WPV1 case, from Borno state, had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016].
- 7 cVDPV2 positive environmental samples reported in Nigeria from 4 states: 3 in Bauchi, 2 in Yobe, 1 in Borno, and 1 in Kaduna.
- The 36th Expert Review Committee for Polio Eradication and Routine Immunization (ERC), the independent technical advisory group in the country, met in Abuja on [29-30 Oct 2018] to review the evolving epidemiology and programmatic implications. The group concluded: Nigeria must maintain momentum by focusing on the remaining inaccessible areas through high quality (above 90% coverage) supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) to prevent cVDPV2 outbreaks and reach the last remaining 70 000 children in Borno.
- The country continues to be affected by 2 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, the 1st centered in Jigawa state, and the 2nd in Sokoto state.
- In response to cVDPV2 detection, the country continues to conduct acute flaccid paralysis surveillance strengthening activities including enhanced active surveillance visits and community sampling. The programme has also carried out an extensive search for type 2 containing vaccines (tOPV/mOPV2) in the areas surrounding where the virus is detected.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 continues, including efforts to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno state.

Lake Chad Basin
- No cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week. There are 7 total number of cVDPV2 reported cases in 2018 in Niger, which are genetically linked to a cVDPV2 outbreak in Jigawa and Katsina states, Nigeria. The virus was isolated from children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from Zinder region, located in the south of Niger and on the border with Nigeria, with dates of onset of paralysis ranging from [18 Jul 2018] through [7 Sep 2018].
- 2 mOPV2 response vaccination campaigns aimed to reach 3.2 million children under 5 years of age in 4 provinces in Niger (Agadez, Diffa, Maradi, and Zinder). The 1st round took place from [24 through 27 Oct 2018] and the 2nd on [7 through 11 Nov 2018].
- Acute flaccid paralysis surveillance and routine immunization across the country with focus on the infected provinces and the provinces at the international borders with Nigeria are being reinforced.
- WHO and its partners are continuing to support local public health authorities in conducting field investigations and risk assessments to more clearly assess risk of the identified cVDPV2 and to conduct additional response measures as appropriate and necessary.
- Active case finding for additional AFP cases is continuing, and additional surveillance measures such as increasing the frequency and extent of environmental surveillance and community sampling of healthy individuals is being expanded.
- WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health to strengthen the risk communication and community engagement.

Central Africa
- No cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The total number of cases detected in the country in 2018 remains 18.
- DRC is affected by 3 separate strains of cVDPV2, in the provinces of Mongala, Maniema and Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri.
- Provincial governors on [26 Jul 2018] convened an urgent meeting and signed the 'Kinshasa Declaration for Polio Eradication'. The high-level meeting was convened by HE the minister of health, as well as the WHO director-general and the regional director for Africa. Provincial governors committed to providing the necessary oversight, accountability and resources needed to urgently improve the quality of the outbreak response being implemented across the country. Outbreak response since cVDPV was 1st confirmed in 2017 has been marred by operational challenges, as too many children continue to remain un- or under-vaccinated. This level of oversight can help ensure that operational deficits are rapidly identified and addressed.
- The polio outbreak response is being conducted simultaneously to an ongoing Ebola outbreak affecting North Kivu province, in the east of the country (close to provinces affected by cVDPV2). As in the past, the polio teams are coordinating closely with the broader humanitarian emergency network, to ensure both outbreaks are addressed in a coordinated manner (as was the case during the recent Ebola outbreak in Equateur province, which was successfully stopped).
- Partners of the GPEI will continue to support authorities across the country, to ensure that this new level of commitment rapidly translates into operational improvements on the ground.

Horn of Africa
- The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) and type 3 (cVDPV3), reporting both cases and environmental positives.
- Somalia has reported a total of 12 cVDPV cases (5 type 2, 6 type 3 and 1, coinfection of both type 2 and type 3) in 2018.
- cVDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in 1 environmental sample in Kenya.
- Outbreak response to both virus types is currently being implemented in line with internationally-agreed guidelines. Large-scale SIAs have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle, and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia, with additional SIAs planned or carried out in the affected zones of the Horn of Africa. Special surveillance activities are being undertaken to determine the origin of the viral circulation.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Papua New Guinea
- 1 new case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) was reported this week from East Sepik province, Angoram district, with onset of paralysis on [26 Sep 2018].
- The total number of cases in the country in 2018 is now 22.
- Emergency Operation Centres are established and operational in all affected provinces; environmental surveillance is functional in 5 sites in 2 major cities.
- 3 SIAs of expanding scope have taken place since late July [2018], from 3 provinces to 9, to nationwide. The most recent was aimed at children under the age of 15, due to large numbers of poorly-immunized older children.
- Detection and reporting of new viruses or cases at this point in the outbreak response is not unusual or unexpected, as surveillance is being strengthened and most reported and confirmed cases had onset of paralysis prior to the start of comprehensive outbreak response.

Middle East
- No cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in Syria. The total number of officially reported cVDPV2 cases in Syria in 2017 remains 74. No cases were reported in 2018. The most recent case (by date of onset of paralysis) was reported in Boukamal district, with onset on [21 Sep 2017].

[The year (2018) continues to identify both WPV-associated and cVDPV-associated polio cases. While numbers are relatively small, they are still occurring, so 2018 will not see the goal of eradication of polio worldwide.

The presence of positive environmental samples for WPV1 in both Pakistan and Afghanistan, and the presence of positive environmental samples for cVDPVs in areas not currently reporting cases signal there is ongoing transmission of the WPV1s and cVDPVs in those areas, resulting in the positive environmental samples.

For a map showing the locations of cases of WPV and cVDPV, see http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/.
