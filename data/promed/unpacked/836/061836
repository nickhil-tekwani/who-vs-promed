Classical swine fever in Moldavia: Emergency report
---------------------------------------------------
(Date of previous reported outbreak: August 1998).
Translation of information received on 11 Jul 2002 from Dr Efim Renita,
Chief Veterinary Officer, Ministry of Agriculture and Food, Kishinev:
Report date: 10 July 2002.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, post-mortem and laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 5 Jul 2002.
Estimated date of first infection: 1 Jul 2002.
Location: Zaim village, Causeni sector, Tighina district (in the eastern
part of the country)
No. of outbreaks: 1
Description of affected population: piglets aged 2 to 4 months and pigs
aged over 4 months.
Total number of animals in the outbreak:
species/susceptible/cases/deaths/destroyed/slaughtered
sui/660/24/17/5/2
On 25 Jun 2002, a day of exceptionally hot weather, routine vaccination
against classical swine fever (CSF) was carried out in a private
pig-breeding farm at Zaim locality (Causeni municipality, Tighina
district); 225 pigs were vaccinated, comprising 6 boars, 13 young sows, 36
fattening pigs, 109 pigs aged over 4 months and 61 piglets aged 2 to 4 months.
Three days later (on 28 June 2002) some of the vaccinated animals
(especially among the animals aged 2 to 4 months and those aged over 4
months) presented complications, such as: anorexia, staggering, vomiting
and in certain cases pyrexia of up to 41-42 C.
After antibiotic treatment the situation appeared to return to normal,
apart from the persistence of anorexia. On 1 July 2002, one of the group of
piglets aged 2 to 4 months died, and on 2 July 2002 three others in the
same age group also died. Samples taken from the latter animals were sent
to the Moldavian national veterinary diagnostic center. The results of
tests for CSF were negative.
On 3 July 2002, five other animals died. Their cadavers did not show any
pathological signs. The samples were examined in the district laboratory.
The results were negative.
On 4 July 2002, three other animals from the group aged 2 to 4 months died.
Two of the cadavers showed signs consistent with CSF (infarction of the
spleen, hemorrhage in the kidneys and bladder). The samples were examined
at the national veterinary diagnostic center and the results were negative.
Diagnosis: By 5 July 2002, the situation had practically returned to
normal; there were only 12 sick animals in the group aged 2 to 4 months
which presented a poor growth rate, and 2 of them were slaughtered. Samples
were collected from the affected organs showing lesions consistent with CSF
and were sent to the national veterinary diagnostic center, which diagnosed
CSF.
Between 6 and 8 July 2002, 5 more animals from the same group died. On 9
July 2002, the 5 remaining animals were slaughtered and, as in the case of
the animals that had died, their cadavers were destroyed by burning.
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: Moldavian national veterinary
diagnostic center.
B. Diagnostic tests used: fluorescent antibody test.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent/origin of infection: the infection may be of vaccinal
origin.
B. Other epidemiological details: clinical signs have been observed in weak
animals presenting a poor growth rate.
Control measures:
In the affected farm, all necessary sanitary and quarantine measures have
been applied. In the zone at risk, vaccination of all susceptible livestock
is being applied and strict veterinary control is being maintained:
-quarantine;
-stamping out;
-control of wildlife reservoirs;
-movement control inside the country;
-screening;
-vaccination.
The situation is now stable. There have been no further deaths or clinical
signs in any of the vaccinated or non vaccinated animals.
