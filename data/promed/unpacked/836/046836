Health officials have issued a warning of a potential measles exposure after an out-of-state visitor with the measles traveled to northern Arizona.

A spokesperson for the Arizona Department of Health Services says the tourist was potentially contagious from 6 to 8 Aug 2018 and visited multiple locations in northern Arizona.

There are currently no cases of measles in the state, but health officials say the visitor may have exposed the public at the locations [listed in the URL above] during the listed times...

"As more and more people become unvaccinated, it creates more pathways to those susceptible individuals. You can develop pneumonia; you can develop swelling of the brain, and 2-3 people out of every 1000 infected with measles will die," Dr. Cara Christ, director of the Arizona Department of Health Services said. "We have a lot of people going from Phoenix to cooler weather right now -- Sedona, the Grand Canyon -- so it could just be one person that brings it back to Phoenix."

[2] USA: California (Los Angeles county, Santa Monica) case in non-resident tourist

Amid reports of measles cases in several states, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health on Friday [17 Aug 2018] announced that one case has been confirmed in a non-resident tourist who visited Santa Monica while infectious earlier this month [August 2018].

[See URL for locations tourist visited.]

"No current risk related to measles exists at these venues at this time, as the period of possible exposure was more than one week ago," according to a Department of Public Health statement. "In addition, because measles is spread from person to person by the respiratory route, there is no risk present related to food that may have been consumed at these locations. However, individuals who were present at these locations during these times, especially those with weakened immune systems or persons who may not have been vaccinated against measles, may be at risk of developing measles and should watch for symptoms of the illness.''

Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash that appears 10-12 days after exposure, and anyone experiencing these should contact their health care provider.

"Getting vaccinated is the best way to keep from getting and spreading measles," Los Angeles County Health Officer Dr. Muntu Davis said.

Those who may have been exposed and have not been immunized can get a measles shot and still be protected from developing the disease, Davis said.

[Reports 1, 2, and 5 highlight the importance of maintaining vaccination against diseases that are considered eliminated because of the risk of exposure during travel or from an infected tourist. Complacency will only lead to an overall decrease in the level of herd immunity, putting individuals who cannot get vaccinated at risk, besides oneself. - Mod.LK

In a follow-up on the imported measles situation in Brazil, the Ministry of Health reported this week that 910 cases of measles have been confirmed in Amazonas; 5630 remain under investigation.

In addition, the state of Roraima has confirmed 296 cases of the disease, and 101 are still under investigation. All the cases are imported from Venezuela.

The genotype of the virus (D8) that is circulating in the country is the same that circulates in Venezuela, a country that has been facing an outbreak of the disease since 2017. Some isolated and import-related cases were identified in the states of São Paulo (1), Rio de Janeiro (14); Rio Grande do Sul (13); Rondônia (1) and Pará (2).

To date, in Brazil, 6 deaths have been confirmed for measles, 4 deaths in the state of Roraima (3 in foreigners and one in a Brazilian) and 2 deaths in the state of Amazonas (Brazil).

The National Campaign on Poliomyelitis and Measles Vaccination will last until 31 Aug 2018 and intends to vaccinate 11.2 million children. The D-day of national mobilization will be on Sat 18 Aug 2018, when more than 36 000 stations will be open in the country. The goal is to vaccinate at least 95% of children to reduce the possibility of polio return and reemergence of measles, diseases already eliminated in Brazil. All children between the ages of one year and under 5 years should be taken to the vaccination posts, regardless of their previous vaccination situation.

In related news, the Pentagon is sending a U.S. Navy hospital ship to Colombia to help treat some of the hundreds of thousands of people who have poured over the border fleeing violence in Venezuela, according to a Stars and Stripes report.

"We're not sending soldiers; we're sending doctors," Mattis said. "It is absolutely a humanitarian mission," he told reporters returning with him to Washington after a 6-day tour of South America.

The Comfort has 12 fully-equipped operating rooms, a 1000-bed hospital facility, digital radiological services, a medical laboratory, a pharmacy, an optometry lab, a CAT scan, and 2 oxygen-producing plants.

Jason Marczak, director of the Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center at the Atlantic Council, told VOA that the situation in Venezuela has led to a migration crisis of global proportions "that is on track to potentially parallel or surpass the numbers that (have been) coming out of the Middle East."

As of June 2018, an estimated 2.3 million people had fled Venezuela, mainly to Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil, according to the United Nations.

[The economic situation and the consequent violence in Venezuela are dire and affecting public health and the mental wellbeing of the population. A humanitarian mission is certainly welcome, but even more support is needed, as an estimated 2.3 million people have fled the country. - Mod.LK

The measles outbreaks that were detected in Argentina and that threaten the region have arrived in Catamarca.

According to Nelly Castro, director of school head No. 224, Province of Entre Rios, this week there was a student who presented a medical certificate indicating that he had measles. In the face of the onset of this disease, a group of parents asked for the suspension activities to disinfect the institution.

In dialogue with Radio San Francisco de Fiambalá about measles outbreaks, Castro, when consulted on respiratory diseases within the institution, responded that while in July 2018 there were numerous cases, currently, the number of sick boys has been reduced considerably. "Now, we have some guys with chickenpox, not many, 3. And we also have a certificate from a student who has measles," he said.

In addition, he commented regarding the Ministry of Health that no one came to the institution, and he admitted that there was a group of 5 parents who came by the school to ask for disinfection in these cases, to which the director responded that she was aiming for this weekend, but indicated that "it should be shared jointly between the institution and the parents, because the fluids used for disinfection are expensive, and the school does not have the resources to buy them. We would need parents to collaborate so that we can do the disinfection, because it is impossible for us. We don't have the resources," he acknowledged, thus revealing the lack of funds for these health cases. "I also [cannot ask] the municipality to help us because I have a single certificate of a case of measles. I should have more cases for the municipality to help us," he said.

This newspaper tried to communicate with different officials of the Ministry of Health to confirm this case but did not obtain answers.

Health authorities have warned of an increased risk of measles in Perth after 6 people reported being infected in the past week.

They had contact with 2 people who recently brought their infections in from overseas, at a workplace, and in a hospital Emergency Department.

The Department of Health said the latest cases visited various public places while they were infectious, so other people may have been exposed to measles, which is highly contagious.
