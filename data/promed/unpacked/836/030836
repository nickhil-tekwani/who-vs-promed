The CDC team returned from Philippines on May 12.
"Our job has been to assist the Philippine government in an investigation
of the primate exporting facilities," said Thomas G. Ksiazek, head of the
CDC team, in an interview with OUTBREAK [on Thursday May 30].
CDC assisted the authorities in Manila in evaluating if there was a public
health problem and dealing with the issue of restoring primate exports
(which they themselves had suspended.)
"We have developed sampling plans to determine if there was any active
infection in primate exporting facilities. All persons working actively in
monkey facilities have been sampled and we have assisted the Philippine
authorities in establishing a long term surveillance system," said Dr.
Ksiazek.
The CDC team has not used BL-4 space suits while drawing blood from the
monkeys. But they did wear long sleeved surgical scrubs, gloves, and
respiratory and eye protection.
CDC did not focus on investigating the Ebola Reston reservoir while in the
Philippines.
"In this instance, we were mainly trying to establish what was going on in
the monkey facilities, which is the first piece of information you need for
to go further," said Tom Ksiazek.
In order to reinstitute monkey exports, the Filovirus advisory group will
make recommendations to the Secretary of Health. Then the Department of
Health will make a recommendation to other agencies concerned with monkey
export. Finally, an official policy on reinstituting exportation will go
into effect.
The CDC spokesman also declared that the monkey outbreak in Texas is now over.
When asked if there was ever a risk for humans in this outbreak, Ksiazek
answered, "I would be reluctant to be a volunteer to be inoculated with
this virus. But on the other hand, four individuals had documented
infections during the 1989-90 outbreak in Reston, and 1 or 2 individuals in
past episodes in the Philippines, and none of those people reported any
illness. One person in the Reston episode clearly exposed himself and was
followed quite closely and he never developed any disease."
Nothing can at the moment be disclosed about the concrete results of the
investigation in the Philippines. An official statement will be released by
the government in Manila in early June.
