The stage was set yesterday for the effective end of the worldwide ban on
British beef exports when the European Commission proclaimed meat from
younger animals to be safe from "mad cow" disease and called on European
Union states to allow sales to resume.
The Commission unanimously backed a proposal from Franz Fischler, the Farm
Commissioner, to start the process of easing the ban on deboned meat from
cattle born after August 1996 and certified free of any contact with
BSE-infected animals. The member states are expected to give their approval
in the autumn or possibly earlier, sending British beef back to continental
shops several weeks later. It recommended that the two-year export ban,
which has to date cost Britain at least £1.5 billion and 1,000 jobs, should
be lifted as soon as possible. Franz Fischler, the EU Agriculture
Commissioner, said that he and the 19 other commissioners had made the
decision.
Other conditions listed by Mr Fischler were that a proper animal tracing
and identification system should be adopted and no meat from animals whose
mother had had BSE would be allowed. The proposal still has to win the
backing of EU veterinary experts and agriculture ministers before the
worldwide export ban is dropped.
"British beef is safe," Herr Fischler assured continental journalists who
voiced public suspicion over continuing risks. He insisted that remaining
conditions would protect consumers and he ruled out suggestions that beef
of British origin should have to be labelled as such in EU shops.
The cut-off date for younger meat, proposed by Britain, coincides with the
ban on the use of animal-based feed, the suspected source of the BSE
epidemic. This will allow through most beef from the six million cattle in
Britain bred for export. Exports have already resumed of most beef from
Northern Ireland. Older cattle and animals connected with herds affected by
BSE will still be banned.
However, general elections in Germany are expected to prompt fierce
opposition to the move from their Government, in response to public fears.
"The German Government has always insisted that preventive measures to
protect consumers must have priority," a spokesman said.
German consumer organisations attacked the proposal. "There is no new
information that should lead the German Government to change its reluctance
to ease the ban," the Working Group of Consumer Federations said. Officials
in Brussels stressed that while Germany was certain to oppose lifting the
ban ahead of its general election on Sept 27, the Bonn government could not
block the measure on its own. However, there are fears that momentum
towards ending the ban could be lost if political agreement is not reached
before the Austrian presidency of the EU takes over from Britain on July 1.
EU approval could come at a meeting of national veterinary officials in
Brussels tomorrow or a council of farm ministers in Luxembourg on June 22,
the last under Britain's presidency.
France gave qualified backing to the proposal. Louis Le Pensec, the French
Farm Minister, said: "We will examine it in a favourable light but we are
not there yet."
Herr Fischler dismissed suggestions that the Commission was rushing an end
to the ban as a favour to the British presidency. He said it had taken nine
months for the British "date-based scheme" to win approval.
Stringent conditions, including extensive inspections, would still be
imposed to guarantee the quality of exported beef, he added. To ensure that
there had been no maternal transmission, only meat from animals over six
months old would be eligible.
The Commission is also starting separate procedures to remove the ban on
gelatine and tallow, beef by-products.
Jeff Almond, Professor of Microbiology at Reading University and a member
of the Government's advisory committee on BSE, said that there was no
longer any scientific basis for maintaining the ban. "The measures we have
had in place since the middle of 1996 mean that the beef in the animals
they are talking about readmitting really is very safe," he said.
In 1995, the last full year before the ban came into force, Britain
exported carcass beef worth £594 million and live calves worth another £73
million. The Meat and Livestock Commission estimated yesterday that the ban
would be lifted from up to two thirds of these exports, nearly all of which
went to the EU.
Austria, which until recently has taken a hard line on BSE, could come
under intense pressure from Bonn to harden its line again. Yesterday's
decision follows a move which allowed exports to resume from Northern
Ireland from June 1. The first beef to be exported from the UK since the
worldwide ban will be shipped from the province on June 29. The small,
"trial" consignment will be sent to the Netherlands for commercial sale in
Europe.
Ulster has a computerised cattle tracking system and suffered the least
number of BSE cases in the UK. The cost of the beef ban in the UK is now
reckoned to be £1.5-£2 billion but the worst effects are still to come,
according to a report prepared for the Government by DTZ Pieda Consulting.
