The moderator is correct in noting [in ProMED-mail post 20150821.3594873] that owners of EIA [equine infectious anemia]-infected equines have the option of placing their animal in permanent quarantine. However, given the role that biting insects play in the transmission of this infection, the CFIA's [Canadian Food Inspection Agency] requirements for permanent quarantine are quite onerous and almost impossible to achieve in a ranch setting. The animal must be housed in an insect-proof enclosure at all times between killing frosts, a minimum distance requirement from non-infected horses must be abided by at all times, and separate equipment used for the infected animal, etc. And, when only a single animal on a farm/ranch is affected, the constant isolation from other horses that is required with permanent quarantine may be more inhumane than humane euthanasia. For all practical purposes, permanent quarantine is probably only a reasonable/feasible option for a limited period of time, such as: for a pregnant/nursing mare until foal is born and weaned; for a high-value stallion to permit semen collection; to give a family some time to come to terms with the loss of a treasured companion.

For horses that are ordered destroyed under the CFIA's EIA control program, the owner is awarded compensation/indemnity in the amount of the market value of the animal up to a maximum of CAD 2000 [about USD 1517] per animal.
