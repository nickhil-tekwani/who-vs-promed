[The following information has been released by Hong Kong's Center for
Health Protection which relates to the ProMED-mail Request for Information:
"Undiagnosed respiratory disease, fatal - China (Hong Kong): RFI
20061229.3649", posted on 29 Dec 2006. - Mod.CP]
The 61-year-old male Sheung Shui Slaughterhouse worker hospitalised 30 Dec
2006 for pneumonia was discharged today. Preliminary microbiological tests
on him found pneumococcus and parainfluenza virus, common respiratory
pathogens that can cause pneumonia.
Centre for Health Protection Community Medicine Consultant Dr Thomas Tsang
said test results on the 44-year-old pig farmer, who died of a
pneumonia-like illness in December 2006, and 23 specimens from local pig
farms will be available in the coming weeks.
Meanwhile, a meat delivery vehicle supervisor from the slaughterhouse was
admitted to North District Hospital today. The 69-year-old man went to
Zhuhai and Panyu and Guangzhou in December 2006, and came down with cough.
He is now in stable condition. His family contacts are asymptomatic.
Dr Tsang said a retrospective review from May to December [2006] is being
conducted on Hospital Authority records to identify pig farmers who had
been hospitalised with pneumonia. "With all the enhanced surveillance
measures and record reviews, it is expected that some more cases of
pneumonia among pig farmers may be uncovered in the process," he said.
There is an average of 4000 pneumonia deaths in Hong Kong a year. The
number of hospitalisations due to pneumonia every year is about 40 000.
The Centre for Health Protection's hotline 2125 1133 for pig farmers has so
far received 9 calls, with only one requiring follow-up action. A forum
will be held at the Centre tomorrow to update pig farmers and live pig
handlers' on the situation and offer health advice.

there is no outbreak of a specific respiratory disease among persons
employed in pig rearing and meat processing in Hong Kong, other than the
normal range of respiratory infections experienced in midwinter. - Mod.CP]
