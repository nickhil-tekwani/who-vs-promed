Approx. 100 birds have died [suddenly] in the last few days in the streets
of Bartolome Bavio, part of Magdalena, Buenos Aires [Province], including
pigeons, thrushes, cardinals,and fieldfares. It is suspected that they
died from eating pesticide-contaminated food.

[Rodenticide is often spread on corn, and pigeons will eat the bait,while
insectivorous birds may eat insects dying from insecticide poisoning. But
in these days when we are on the lookout for the arrival of West Nile virus
in South America, it would be important to exclude that diagnosis. Perhaps
an ornithologist reader can tell us whether any of the species mentioned
are likely to be recently arrived migrants from North America. We would
like to receive more details of this outbreak. - Mod.JW]
