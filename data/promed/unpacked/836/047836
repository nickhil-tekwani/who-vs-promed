The presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has been confirmed in another commercial turkey flock in Utah. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) reported that on 26 Jul 2022, HPAI was confirmed in a flock of 12 700 turkeys in Sanpete County, Utah, making it the 3rd HPAI case in that county.

The 2 previous cases in Sanpete County were confirmed on 14 Jul 2022 and 19 Jul 2022 -- both of which were larger flocks than the most recently affected one. Between the 3 flocks, avian influenza has affected 38 800 commercial turkeys in Sanpete County.

The latest case marks the 4th case of HPAI in Utah in 2022. The 1st case was confirmed on 22 Apr 2022 in a commercial table egg layer flock in Cache County. There were more than 1.5 million layers in that flock.

Backyard flocks in the Utah counties of Utah, Salt Lake and Cache have also been affected by HPAI, as has a petting zoo/exhibition farm in Salt Lake County. With the exception of the 3 Sanpete County cases, the control areas related to all other HPAI cases in Utah have been released, according to APHIS.

Prior to the 3 Sanpete County cases, the last case of HPAI in the United States was confirmed on 9 Jun 2022 in a flock of 205 000 commercial layer pullets in Weld County, Colorado.

So far in 2022, HPAI has been confirmed in commercial poultry in the states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Oklahoma, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, Kentucky, Indiana, Colorado, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and Utah. The virus has also been found in commercial game bird operations in Texas, New York and South Dakota.

State officials report that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has been confirmed in a Flathead County backyard poultry flock. The Montana Department of Livestock (MDOL) reports this is the 10th flock in Montana with HPAI that is linked to a 2022 wave of HPAI infections in the United States traced to seasonal migrations of wild birds. Nationally, nearly 400 poultry flocks have been diagnosed with HPAI, according to MDOL.

"With over 2 months since our last case of HPAI in the state, we had hoped that avian influenza was behind us," said Montana state veterinarian Marty Zaluski. "Unfortunately, the risk seems to persist, and poultry owners should continue to practice enhanced biosecurity measures."

Sick birds can exhibit numerous signs such as swollen eyes, discolored comb and legs, a significant drop in egg production or water and feed consumption, or sudden death. Samples from the flocks are submitted to the Montana Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (MVDL) and tested for the presence of avian influenza.

MDOL encourages all poultry producers to immediately report sudden onset of illness or high death loss in domestic poultry to their veterinarian or the MDOL. People who find sick or dead wild birds that have died from unknown causes should contact their local FWP warden, biologist or regional office, or call the FWP wildlife veterinarian.

Infected flocks are placed under quarantine and are required to depopulate all remaining birds on the premises to prevent further disease spread. Flock owners are eligible to receive indemnity on birds from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).

Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease of birds that can cause high mortality rates in domestic flocks. Migratory waterfowl are the primary source for avian influenza (AI). Wild birds can be infected and appear healthy but shed virus in the feces, saliva, and respiratory secretions. Domestic poultry become infected through direct contact with infected wild birds, or through contact with contaminated objects, equipment, or the environment.

According to a news release, MDOL is conducting an epidemiological investigation and will be identifying other poultry producers in the area to conduct disease surveillance and to provide educational resources.

MDOL encourages poultry producers to implement the following biosecurity measures to protect flocks:
- Prevent contact between wild or migratory birds and domestic poultry, including access by wild birds to feed and water sources. House birds indoors to the extent possible to limit exposure to wild or migratory birds.
- Limit visitor access to areas where birds are housed.
- Use dedicated clothing and protective footwear when caring for domestic poultry.
- Immediately isolate sick animals and contact your veterinarian or MDOL.

While HPAI is considered a potentially zoonotic disease, CDC continues to consider the risk to people from wild birds, backyard flocks, and commercial poultry to be low.

Existing safeguards to keep food safe and wholesome are sufficient to protect people, and the food supply in the United States is one of the safest in the world. As a reminder, the USDA recommends cooking poultry to 165 deg F.

[3] Pennsylvania (Northampton County): backyard flock

Pennsylvania has a new confirmed case of avian flu, the state's 1st in a noncommercial, backyard flock, the state Department of Agriculture said in a press release. A duck and chickens from a flock in Upper Mount Bethel Township in Northampton County were confirmed to be infected after a dead turkey vulture was found on the property. Wild birds are known to be a source of infection, the release last week noted.

The department has quarantined the infected farm and established a roughly 6-mile control area around it where products are subject to testing requirements and farmers need permits to transport products. Work is underway to clean and disinfect the farm and safely dispose of potentially infected material. Anyone within about 1.75 miles of the infected farm may not transport any poultry or egg products.

Avian influenza does not present an immediate public health concern, human health is not at risk, and poultry and eggs remain safe to eat, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

"Backyard bird owners should recognize this disease is deadly to their birds," Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding said in the release. "Protecting their birds helps protect neighboring poultry farms and the families and jobs depending on those businesses."

Redding reminded backyard bird owners and poultry and egg producers to stay vigilant, especially as wild bird migration season picks up again in the coming weeks.

Poultry farmers can take the following measures to limit the spread of avian flu:
- Wear clean clothes, scrub footwear with disinfectant, and wash hands before and after contact with animals.
- Keep equipment and vehicles clean, including all those entering your property.
- Control birds and rodents who can carry and spread disease.
- Keep your birds inside whenever possible and minimize the chance of contact with wild birds.
- Clean under barn soffits and eliminate possible entry points for wild birds.
- Eliminate standing water that may attract wild birds.

For detailed information on protecting your flock, visit the USDA's Defend the Flock page (https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/defend-the-flock-program/defend-the-flock-program).

Signs of avian flu in birds include sudden death; lack of energy, appetite and coordination; purple discoloration or swelling of body parts; diarrhea; nasal discharge; coughing; sneezing; and reduced egg production or abnormal eggs.

Suspected cases and any unusual deaths can be reported to the department. A veterinarian is on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

Sick or dead wild birds should be reported to the Pennsylvania Game Commission or <pgc-wildlifehealth@pa.gov>.

Last week, Redding announced the details of USD 25 million in direct relief to poultry producers to support recovery from the avian influenza outbreak. The state's 2022-23 budget invests an additional USD 6 million to the PA Animal Diagnostic Laboratory System to support ongoing testing needs.

After nearly a 3-week break in bird flu detections, avian influenza was detected in a Walla Walla County backyard flock on 12 Aug 2022, bringing the state-wide flock total to 31. Even though cases have slowed in Washington, neighboring states continue to detect bird flu, indicating the virus is still in the environment. [Migration southward will soon begin, so all bird owners need to be on the alert again. - Mod.TG]

"While we had hoped cases would [taper] off by now, current trends suggest that resident wild waterfowl are creating a reservoir of ongoing infection. We must stay vigilant and prepared to respond for the coming weeks, and potentially months," Washington State veterinarian Dr. Amber Itle said.

Flock owners within 10 kilometers (6.2 mi) of a detection are encouraged to self-report the health of their flock via the WSDA online surveillance self-reporting tool.

Itle says the biggest risk factor is direct contact with wild waterfowl. All 31 infected flocks have had contact with them.

Flock owners should be discouraged to bring their birds to fairs, exhibitions, poultry auctions, and on-farm sales until there hasn't been a detection in the state for 30 days. If your flock experiences sudden death or illness of several birds, call the WSDA Sick Bird Hotline.

[5] California (Sacramento, Butte, Stanislaus, Mendocino, Santa Clara counties), backyard birds, other privately owned birds

More avian flu outbreaks have been reported in northern California, including a backyard flock of chickens in Sacramento County and a large outbreak among 1500 privately owned birds in Butte County.

The Butte County discovery prompted a declaration of a "local health emergency" Wednesday [17 Aug 2022]. It appears to be the largest outbreak in California, according to records compiled by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).

Until now, only 40 birds were found to have been infected with the disease in California, according to the USDA's tally, although those records appear to be incomplete.

In addition to the discoveries in Butte and Sacramento counties, the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory has also found 2 cases of the Eurasian H5N1 strain in Stanislaus County and one each in Mendocino and Santa Clara counties, according to a memo from the California Department of Food and Agriculture.

The disease, which is rare in humans and typically caused by direct contact with birds or infected surfaces, can cause symptoms similar to those of human influenza. There is no treatment for the disease. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported one case of a human contracting the disease in May [2022]. Officials said the person was an inmate at a prison in Colorado who was working with chickens as part of a pre-release program.

All told, about 40 million birds have been infected across the country, the USDA says. The disease has been most prevalent in Iowa, where more than 13.3 million birds have been diagnosed.

In Butte County, the birds were expected to be killed Thursday [18 Aug 2022] afternoon, according to a memo from Public Health Director Danette York. State and federal officials then planned to dispose of the carcasses in a landfill south of Chico and Paradise, she wrote. Her memo didn't identify the type of birds contracting the disease. A county spokeswoman referred questions about the facility to the California Department of Food and Agriculture.

Citing privacy concerns, a spokeswoman at the agency declined to identify the facility where the outbreak occurred or reveal what type of birds were infected. Meanwhile, Butte County Health Officer Davis Canton declared a local health emergency because of the "threat of communicable disease due to a large number of potentially infectious animal carcasses."

[[Avian influenza is still causing problems for poultry and backyard producers and hobby raisers. It seems late in the year to be seeing these cases. However, as fall migrations begin occurring, we are likely to see more cases. The hot summer was a bit of reprieve, but case numbers could increase again with the autumn migrations. So please keep your birds indoors and protected from other fowl. Keep your biosecurity in action. Protect your birds and yourselves. - Mod.TG
