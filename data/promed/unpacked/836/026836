Black spot infection in field peas growing in South Australia has been
high this season [2009], especially in early-sown crops. According to
SA Research and Development Institute [SARDI] Jenny Davidson, the high
level of infection is due to several reasons.

"Black spot spores were released in June [2009], which is later than
in most years, leading to high spore numbers infecting seedling
crops," Ms Davidson said. "Early-sown crops had the most exposure to
these spores and so have more disease. The disease has been increased
by the frequent rain events during July [2009], which splashed the
infection from the base of the pea plants to the higher nodes."

On top of the high infection loads, some pea crops have been sown into
paddocks that had peas in 2005. "Black spot was severe in the spring
of 2005 and produced a spore load that has survived in the soil. This
spore load has been splashed by the frequent rain onto the current
season's crop. In addition, plant injury through herbicide application
may have exacerbated disease levels," Ms Davidson said.

She said fungicide sprays to reduce black spot severity could be
economic. Sprays should be timed ahead of a major rain event to
minimise spread of the disease during rainfall. Black spot will not
spread in dry conditions.

[Any one or combinations of 3 fungi may cause black spot in field
peas, namely _Mycosphaerella pinodes_, _Phoma pinodella_, and
_Ascochyta pisi_, depending on the region. All 3 can occur together
and symptoms caused by each may not be easily distinguished from the
other. The disease is generally referred to as the ascochyta-, or
black spot-complex of field pea. Symptoms may include leaf and pod
spots, blight, and root rot. The fungi can survive as dormant spores
in the soil in some areas, on pea stubble for more than 3 years, and
they may also be seed- and airborne. Up to 45 percent of seeds from
areas receiving over 350 mm (14 in) of rain per year may carry black
spot infection, while seed from areas with less rain are almost free
from infection. Disease management may include fungicides and cultural
practices, but clean seed and isolation from sources of infection is
most important.
