40 farms identified with Schmallenberg in UK
--------------------------------------------
Schmallenberg virus (SBV) has now been identified in samples submitted from 40 farms in the south and east of England, across the counties of Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Kent, East Sussex, West Sussex, and Hertfordshire.

All of the counties where SBV infection has been identified are in the zones recognised as potentially at risk from infected midges being blown across last summer from affected areas in northern mainland Europe.

With the exception of one SBV positive cattle sample from a farm in West Sussex, all of the GB cases of SBV infection have been diagnosed in sheep to date.

A total of 94 farms in northern France have been hit by a novel virus, 1st uncovered in Germany last year, that strikes cattle, sheep and goats, a French research agency reported on Tuesday [14 Feb 2012].

The Schmallenberg virus, named after the town in Germany where it first surfaced, causes diarrhea and falling milk production in cattle and fetal defects in lambs, calves and kids, the Centre for International Cooperation in Agricultural Development Research (Cirad) said. In addition to France and Germany, cases have also occurred in Belgium, Britain and the Netherlands, it said.

The Paris-based World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), which monitors cross-border trade in farm animals, said it was closely following events. The virus is not a "listed disease," the OIE told AFP, referring to diseases that require member-states to notify the agency whenever they detect an outbreak.

However, "countries have been very proactive and transparent in notifying the OIE of the appearance of the Schmallenberg virus on their territories. Disease surveillance and control has proven to work very well," it said. "The OIE is monitoring the situation very closely and has decided to convene a group of experts this week to review the current knowledge."
