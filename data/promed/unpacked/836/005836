The Thailand Bureau of Epidemiology, Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health reported 340 _Streptococcus suis_ cases through 22 Dec 2020. In addition, 12 fatalities were reported. This is down from the 377 cases and 29 deaths recorded in 2019.

The provinces with the highest incidence include Uttaradit, Phichit, Phayao, Kamphaeng Phet and Lampang.

_S. suis_ infection tends to occur sporadically especially in the high-risk regions due to a risky behavior of eating local favorite food, i.e., raw pork with fresh blood (Lahp-moo) and close contact with pigs with no proper personal protection.

Human _S. suis_ infection is a zoonotic infection associated with pigs. The infection can be fatal, particularly if the specific strain produces certain toxins. _S. suis_ infection can manifest itself in meningitis, hearing impairment, toxic shock, septicemia and endocarditis. It can be contracted either through ingesting raw pork or if it comes in contact with an open wound or mucous membrane.

To prevent the disease, members of the public are advised to always practice personal and environmental hygiene. They should avoid contact with pigs that are sick or dead from diseases and their excreta or body fluid. If contact with pigs or raw pork is necessary, one should use protective gloves, wash hands after handling pigs or raw pork, and clean and cover all wounds properly.

[_Streptococcus suis_ is facultative anaerobic gram-positive alpha-hemolytic coccus that is sub-divided into at least 35 serotypes, based on antigenicity of their capsular polysaccharides (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3623174/); serotypes vary in pathogenicity (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5244560/). Serotype 2 is the most frequently isolated serotype from diseased animals. _S. suis_ has been isolated from asymptomatic pigs; the natural habitat of _S. suis_ is the upper respiratory tract, particularly the tonsils and nasal cavities, and the genital and alimentary tract of pigs (https://www.farmhealthonline.com/US/disease-management/pig-diseases/streptococcus-suis/), but virulent strains can cause serious disease mainly in suckling and recently weaned pigs (polyarthritis, meningitis, and septicemia) (https://vetmed.iastate.edu/vdpam/FSVD/swine/index-diseases/streptococcal-infection).

_S. suis_ can cause potentially fatal zoonotic infection in humans, namely, meningitis, septicemia, and endocarditis (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC97186/). Toxic shock may also occur if the strain produces the appropriate toxins.

Human _S. suis_ infection occurs mainly among those who slaughter infected pigs. Eating appropriately cooked meat or organs from infected pigs is said to pose no risk of _S. suis_ infection. However, people who eat raw infected pork and cooks who prepare food from infected pork meat and organs would also be at risk of infection. Person-to-person spread does not seem to occur (see http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/50/2/201).

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), a viral infection in pigs, is known to have an immunosuppressive effect, which is thought to increase pigs' susceptibility to infection with _S. suis_. - Mod.ML
