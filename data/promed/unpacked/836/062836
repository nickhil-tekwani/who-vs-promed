About 55 inmates have been feared dead from the outbreak of cholera in the notorious prison locally known as "Jail Ogaden" in the regional capital of Jigjiga [Somali Region], and several others are in a severe condition following the outbreak of the disease. This also followed a report that in the last week [up to 28 Nov 2013], about 45 inmates have died in the cells after the guards forced them to drink from contaminated water Jerry cans.

A visit to "Jail Ogaden" in the regional capital of Jigjiga revealed that about 55 people [died] over the weekend [week ending 24 Nov 2013] after stooling and vomiting consistently. "I saw their (inmates') corpses, about 55, lying among the prisoners, while others [were] vomiting and stooling continuously," said a relative visitor.

The notorious prison in the regional capital of Jigjiga has the capacity of 400 inmates; however, currently it holds several thousand inmates, which is more than it should. This is not the 1st time that a cholera outbreak has happened in the notorious Jail Ogaden in the regional capital of Jigjiga.

The Puppet Administration of Ogaden did not carry out an awareness campaign to the jails and environs on how best to sanitize environment in order to stop the spread of the disease in and around the "Jail Ogaden."

[3] Cholera - Togo
Date: Tue 26 Nov 2013

Thousands of chlorine tablets are being distributed to combat an outbreak of cholera in Togo. The global children's charity Plan International has provided 120 000 of the pills to help clean water in the affected areas. The outbreak has now spread outside the capital Lome and as far north as the Central Region.

At least 130 cases of cholera have been identified. A total of 7 people have died so far. Some of the cases have come from the fishing area of Katanga in the capital Lome, which is considered to be one of the sources of the outbreak. "It seems that some people do not follow the hygiene rules and some continue to drink water without cleaning it with chlorine pills," says Mohamed Bah, Plan's country director in Togo. In addition to the chlorine pills, Plan has also provided soap, rubber gloves and water purification tablets.

"Children under 5 are particularly vulnerable. Poor access to water and poor hygiene and sanitation conditions put them at extra risk of infection. But cholera is easy to prevent by improving basic hygiene, access to clean water and sharing information," adds Mr Bah.

[The World Health Organization says:
"Cholera is an easily treatable disease. The prompt administration of oral rehydration salts to replace lost fluids nearly always results in cure. In especially severe cases, intravenous administration of fluids may be required to save the patient's life."
