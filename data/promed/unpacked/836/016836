Eastern Province health director Dr Kennedy Malama said the province has
recorded 6 deaths from measles. In an update early in the week, Dr Malama
said Lundazi district recorded 4 measles deaths while Nyimba recorded 2.
"As I mentioned, Lundazi [reported] 1086 [cases], Nyimba 345, Chadiza 125,
Katete 123, Chipata 105, Petauke 91, Chama 30, and Mambwe 3, giving us a
total of 1908," Dr Malama said.

He urged the general public to ensure that all the children were immunised
against measles. "We need to support the health workers as they undertake
the immunisation campaign when they are doing their outreach programmes.
Let me mention that we have seen that measles does not only affect children
in the province; we have some adults who have actually been affected by
measles," Dr Malama said.

He appealed to parents to ensure that all their children received
vaccination not only for measles but all the immunisations which were due.
"As we have indicated before, if a child is immunised it's not automatic
that that child is protected. When you immunise 100 children, there are
about 5 to 15 percent children who cannot be protected, and that's why we
are doing repeat immunisation so that even those who were immunised years
back, when the campaign comes they can still be immunised like we recently
did during the child health week," Dr Malama said.

He said the Ministry of Health had some challenges in the province because
some sections of the population were not very supportive in taking their
children for vaccinations. "Some, on religious basis, have denied the
children access to these immunisations but the consequences in some cases
have been very, very clear. So we once again appeal to all the stakeholders
to embrace immunisation. It's the only magic bullet we have to ensure that
all our children are immunised, and if we did that, we are going to see
fewer measles cases," said Dr Malama.

[Apparently, these case numbers are just for the Eastern province. The 6
Aug 2010 ProMED-mail report (archive number 20100806.2669) quoted he
Ministry of Health as saying that measles in Zambia has affected more than
6200 people and claimed at least 110 lives. The current report indicates
that the measles outbreak in Zambia continues. One hopes that the
vaccination campaign will slow transmission of this preventable virus disease.
