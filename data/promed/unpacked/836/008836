The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) is investigating a suspected
outbreak of _Brucella canis_, the cause of canine brucellosis. If
confirmed, this will be the first occurrence of this disease in New
Zealand. _Brucella canis_ primarily affects dogs, but it can also infect
humans. Human cases are sporadic and the clinical signs (headaches, chills,
nausea and weigh loss) are mild [though human endocarditis due to _B.
canis_ has been published at the case report level -Man. Ed. DS.
The investigation began when a St Bernard dog in Wellington with an
inflamed testicle was blood tested and found to be serologically positive
for _Brucella canis_ (i.e., the blood sample showed evidence of _Brucella
canis_ antibodies). The infected dog was born in New Zealand as the product
of semen imported from the USA, where _Brucella canis_ occurs widely. A
second St Bernard bitch imported from the USA and resident in the same
household also tested positive, as has the bitch's daughter. All imported
dogs to New Zealand are tested for _Brucella canis_, as are semen donors.
The _Brucella canis_ diagnosis is currently presumptive as approximately
10% of dogs may return a false positive _Brucella canis_ serological result
due to cross-reactions with a number of common bacteria. MAF is attempting
to secure a definitive diagnosis by isolating the bacteria through culture.
_Brucella canis_ is sexually transmitted by the mating of infected males
and females. The infected female usually appears healthy with no signs of
disease or indication that she is a carrier of the bacteria. She can spread
_Brucella_ to other animals through her urine, aborted pups, or more
commonly at mating. Once pregnant, the bacteria will also infect the
developing fetuses causing illness. An infected male can spread the
_Brucella_ bacteria via his semen. Litters of infected bitches are often
aborted in the last 2 weeks of gestation, or the puppies may die shortly
after birth. The aborted pups are usually partially decomposed and
accompanied by a grey to green vaginal discharge, which can contain high
levels of bacteria. People should avoid contact with dead fetuses or
discharges from aborting dogs.
To report a case for investigation, please phone the MAF National Centre
for Disease Investigation (0800 809966) and inform the operator that the
query is to do with the canine _Brucella_ investigation.

[It is important to remember that human infections with _B. canis_ are
mild, while people infected with _B. abortus_, _B. melitensis_ and _ B.
suis_ are facing a more serious and protracted situation. The little
clinical information presented here for the Saint Bernard certainly fits
with the positive serology, so I am not expecting a negative culture
result. However, one must recognize the wisdom of awaiting the culture
results before letting the fat lady sing because false positive serology
commonly occurs with _B. canis_. -Mod. PC
