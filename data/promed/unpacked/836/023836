Avian Influenza, Italy - clarification
-----------------------------------------
The low-pathogenic H5 strain detected in Italy was obtained as a
result of surveillance efforts from a premise rearing primarily
waterfowl, a small number of galliform birds and one psittacine. In
detail, the farm contained 1600 mallard breeders (_Anas
platyrhynchos_), 8310 mallards for release in the wild, 100 pheasants
(_Phasianus colchicus_), 4 teals (_Anas crecca_), 6 Mandarin ducks
(_Aix galericulata_), 3 Swan geese (_Cygnopsis cygnoides_), 9 Canada
geese (_Branta canadensis_) and one African grey parrot (_Psittacus
erithacus_). None of these birds are to be considered wild birds as
they were all reared in captivity, and none of them exhibited any
clinical signs.
The H5 virus was detected by real-time PCR, and sequence analysis of
the cleavage site confirms the low pathogenic nature of the strain.
Additional testing by molecular methods indicate that the virus does
not belong to the N1 subtype. Virus isolation attempts are in progress.
The affected holding is located in a wetland, and there are no
industrial poultry farms within a 10-km radius. According to EC
Directive 2005/94, a one-km restriction zone has been established.
Rural farms in the restriction zone will be tested to establish
whether there are any additional positives.
The detection of a low pathogenicity avian influenza virus in
mallards farmed in a wetland is a normal finding and is in-keeping
with the ecology of these viruses. It does not represent a threat for
public health.

[ProMED-mail requested details (see 20061101.3121) pertaining to the
serotype involved in the described outbreak and its pathogenicity.
The authoritative, firsthand, exemplary response from Dr. Capua is
gratefully appreciated. It adds new details on the affected
population and provides explanation as to the control steps applied
by the Italian authorities in spite of the low pathogenicity of the
H5 strain involved.
According to the provisions of chapter 2.7.12 of OIE's terrestrial
animal health code, this outbreak is regarded as "notifiable avian
influenza" (NAI), namely "an infection of poultry caused by any
influenza A virus of the H5 or H7 subtypes." Since the laboratory
confirmed that the strain was not highly pathogenic, it has become a
case of "Low pathogenic notifiable avian influenza" (LPNAI). For the
practical, prescribed consequences of such an event upon the status
of the affected country, readers are referred to the text of the code
articles 2.7.12.1., 2.7.12.2. and 2.7.12.3., available at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mcode/en_chapitre_2.7.12.htm>.
