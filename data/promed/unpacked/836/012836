The majority of businesses in St. Vincent and the Grenadines have
been feeling the pinch, and most of them are not optimistic that
their finances will get better soon.

To add to our list of woes, we got news last week that the EU and the
Latin American countries had struck a deal and agreed to lower, yet
again, the tariffs placed on Latin bananas.

And this week, news of the black sigatoka disease affecting our
bananas broke. Can it get any worse?

Undoubtedly, the Prime Minister will pay some attention in the budget
to making the transition to alternative economic activity easier for
those who will be forced out of the banana business by the recent developments.

[With no previous records], _Mycosphaerella fijiensis_ [was found] on
plantains and bananas. To date, the problem is restricted to the
northern portion of the country. It was detected in November 2009.
Active surveillance is ongoing to determine its spread, though we are
of the opinion that it is restricted only to 4 farms in the north.

We are confident that if the problem is in the early stages, there is
a high probability in restricting its spread or managing the
situation. The fear is that if the situation turns out to be
different [i.e. if the disease has already spread more widely -
Mod.DHA], judged from the current island-wide survey being
undertaken, then it will be very costly to manage.

[Black sigatoka (BS), also known as black leaf streak, is caused by
the fungus _Mycosphaerella fijiensis_, which affects only species and
hybrids of _Musa_. Worldwide, BS is one of the most devastating leaf
diseases of bananas with yield losses of 50 percent or more. It is
present in the Americas, China, South East Asia, and parts of Africa.
Several outbreaks in Australia have been successfully eradicated.
Infection occurs on the youngest leaves of the plant during and
immediately after unfurling, while older leaves are not readily infected.

BS causes destruction of leaf tissue affecting the photosynthetic
capabilities of the plant. Fruit produced on diseased plants can
ripen prematurely during commercial shipment and cause further
losses. The pathogen is spread by water, wind, and contaminated
materials including suckers for planting. Disease management includes
frequent applications of fungicides, phytosanitary measures to reduce
inoculum, and cultural practices, but the high costs of these
measures make them essentially unavailable to smallholder farmers.

Another type of sigatoka leaf spot, yellow sigatoka (YS), is caused
by the related species _M. musicola_. Symptoms of both diseases are
often similar, and laboratory analysis may be needed for a clear
diagnosis. However, YS is considered less serious than BS because
symptoms appear mainly on older leaves, and, therefore, less damage
is caused to photosynthetic tissue. Also, there are more cultivars of
banana and plantain with degrees of resistance to YS than to BS.

Both YS and BS have been causing serious crop losses in the Caribbean
region. In St Vincent & Grenadines, leaf spot diseases were reported
to be a major problem for banana growers in 2008 (ProMED-mail post
20080215.0605), but this appears to be the 1st time BS has been
confirmed in the country.
