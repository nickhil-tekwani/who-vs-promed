[Tubas is situated in the northeastern part of the Palestinian Authority (P.A.), district West Bank, about 17 km [10.6 mi] western to the river Jordan/the border with the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, and about the same distance from the demarcation line with Israel.

An immediate notification from Jordan, submitted to the OIE on 8 Nov 2021, informed the diagnosis of (untyped) outbreak of FMD in the vicinity of a livestock market in Amman. Media reports hinted the possible linkage between this event and imported calves. No information on the origin of such import became available.

Recently, several media sources in Jordan reported that FMD has been affecting cattle in Dhlail, about 30 km [18.6 mi] northeast of Amman (map at <tinyurl.com/jxkd5ysy>). The report further mentioned the demands of cow farm owners to vaccinate their livestock "to avoid losses resulting from the rapid spread of the virus."

Israel reported to the OIE in June 2021 that an FMD event on its northern district, bordering Lebanon, was resolved. The causative agent was genotyped O/ME-SA/PanAsia-2. Spread was prevented by the earlier mass vaccination, additional revaccinations, and zoosanitary measures. No further cases have been reported since. More details are available in ProMED post 20210611.8441061.

To apply matching vaccine strains in Jordan, the Palestinian territories, Israel, and other countries in the region, details on the serotype and genotype of the FMD strain(s) currently circulating in Jordan and the P.A. are essential. - Mod.AS
