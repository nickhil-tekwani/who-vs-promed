NEWS

Community deaths in Rwampara

- The community death registered in Rwampara Health Zone, Ituri Province is the mother of a child who died of Ebola in Oicha in early May 2019. She was neither vaccinated nor followed. When she became ill, she was treated for home poisoning by a traditional healer. After a few days, she was admitted to a 1st health post. Due to the deteriorating symptoms, her family wanted to transfer her to another health center, but she died on the way. The dignified and secure burial has been realized.

"Everything about Ebola" conference at the University of Assumption in Congo (UAC)
-----------------
- This Sat 8 Jun 2019, an Ebola conference was organized for UAC students in Butembo. The students had the opportunity to ask all their questions about the disease and about the response mechanisms to the teams present at the conference. They talked about vaccines, response strategies, and how to manage the disease. Several Ebola conferences are organized in the different universities of Butembo to inform the students who will, in turn, raise their awareness.

Situation of providers in Mabalako

- Contrary to civil society statements, no providers' strike took place in Mabalako this Saturday, 8 Jun 2019, and the response activities proceeded as planned.
- Regarding the payment of Ebola premiums from providers working in the Mabalako sub-coordination, the Ministry of Health was informed of irregularities in the payment of these premiums by national, provincial and local agents. These irregularities take the form of unjustified extensions in the field and an organized system of double premium payments. The General Inspectorate of Health has been seized and investigations are under way.

[2] Outbreak Summaries
- WHO: Disease Outbreak News 6 Jun 2019
https://www.who.int/csr/don/06-Jun-2019-ebola-drc/en/

As the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak surpasses the 2000 case mark, indicators over the past 2 weeks provide early signs of an easing of the transmission intensity. This follows a period of improved security and therefore access to communities, allowing response teams to operate more freely. A total of 88 confirmed cases were reported each week for the past 2 epidemiological weeks, down from a peak of 126 cases per week observed in April 2019. Declines in the incidence of new cases have been most apparent in hotspots such as Katwa, Mandima and Beni health zones. Concurrently, improvements in the proportion of cases among contacts registered prior to onset (up from 30% 3 weeks ago to 55% last week), and a lower proportion of cases resulting from transmission within community health facilities (from 31% during the 1st week of April 2019 to 9% during the last week of May 2019), are encouraging. Nevertheless, both indicators are below where we would aim to be. The outbreak continues to be contained within 12 active health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

However, substantive rates of transmission continue within affected communities, and further waves of the outbreak may be expected. An increase in the incidence of new cases has been reported from Mabalako Health Zone in recent weeks, and high infection rates continue within Butembo metropolitan. Times between detecting, reporting and admission of cases at Ebola treatment/transit centres (ETCs) remains too long (median 6 days, interquartile range 4-9 days in the past 3 weeks), with about 1/3rd (34% in the past 3 weeks) of cases dying outside of ETCs. Collectively these indicators highlight that the risks associated with this outbreak remain very high.

In the 21 days between 15 May to 4 Jun 2019, 80 health areas within 12 health zones reported new cases, representing 12% of the 664 health areas within North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Table 1 and Figure 2). During this period, a total of 280 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the Mabalako (27%, n=75), Butembo (23%, n=63), Katwa (16%, n=44), Beni (11%, n=30), Kalunguta (8%, n=23), Mandima (7%, n=19) and Musienene (5%, n=14) health zones.

As of 4 Jun 2019, a total of 2025 EVD cases, including 1931 confirmed and 94 probable cases, were reported. A total of 1357 deaths were reported (overall case fatality ratio 67%), including 1263 deaths among confirmed cases. Of the 2025 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, 58% (1170) were female, and 29% (589) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 110 (5% of total cases).

- Thu 6 Jun 2019. No "reset" with Ebola outbreak. As many as 25% of cases missed. Vaccine predicted to run out
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Response and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/06/no-reset-ebola-outbreak-who-official-says


Today [6 Jun 2019] leaders from the World Health Organization (WHO) said the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) remains contained to a small geographic area, but that does not mean the virus is retreating.

"At any point it could flare up within a zone," said Mike Ryan, MD, a WHO assistant director-general. Ryan, citing information contained in yesterday's WHO Ebola situation report, said there are some encouraging signs, including lower transmission rates in known hot spots and more surveillance.

"Surveillance has intensified to 1300 alerts per day, of which between 200 and 300 are validated and tested," Ryan said. "The number of contacts being followed is 15 000."

Ryan said the outbreak's reproduction rate is 1.04, meaning that every Ebola case begets one additional case. That means transmission is flat, not increasing, but also not decreasing significantly.

Throughout the press conference, Ryan called the outbreak complex. In addition to the security challenges in the region, he said certain health-seeking behavior and community death practices have contributed to the outbreak's longevity.

About 20% of Ebola case-patients 1st seek healthcare in a health zone far away from where they live, which makes it hard to make connections between transmission chains. Additionally, several deaths are still occurring in the community. Each community death, Ryan said, raises the risk of further disease spread.

Ryan also said the WHO estimates it is detecting 75% of cases, with as many as 25% missed or being picked up "too late."

He also responded to recent criticism from various non-governmental organizations that the WHO needs to "reset" the outbreak response. "This is not an iPhone. We don't just hit a reset button," Ryan said. "We get to adapt ... and make the response the best we can make it."

He also reminded the reporters in the room that 80% of vaccinators in the region are Congolese, and most doctors and nurses working the outbreak are Congolese. "It's Congolese people ending this outbreak," he said.

Today [6 Jun 2019], the DRC ministry of health confirmed 6 new cases of Ebola and 10 deaths, raising outbreak totals to 2031 cases and 1367 deaths. Three of the 10 deaths occurred in the community, which is a lower percentage than usual.

A total of 293 suspected cases are still under investigation, and 130 711 have been vaccinated. The number of infected healthcare workers remained at 110.

Yesterday [5 Jun 2019], Robert Redfield, MD, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told Congress that the world must be prepared for this outbreak to spread internationally, and for vaccine supplies to dwindle, according to a Devex story.

Ryan, when asked about Redfield's comments, deflected. "Dr. Redfield is trying to bring attention to the outbreak; that's a good thing," he said.

Redfield said vaccine production is being held up by plant validation. Merck had manufactured the vaccine, rVSV-ZEBOV, in Pennsylvania until recently moving the operation to Germany.

There are currently about 145 000 doses of the vaccine, too few for a planned broader vaccination campaign that would look toward vaccinating geographic regions instead of contact rings.

[A number of articles about the same press briefing by Dr. Ryan have suggested that the actual case counts are at least 25% higher than those reported by the DRC MOH and WHO. However, I believe this is a misinterpretation of his comments, because those cases that aren't detected before death outside of treatment centres are nevertheless recorded in the official figures. With regard to vaccine supplies, clearly production would have to be ramped up substantially either in preparation for a blanketed vaccination campaign in the DRC aiming to achieve herd immunity, or in the event of the outbreak's spread beyond the DRC's borders. - Mod.LXL]

- Tue 4 Jun 2019. U.N. appoints David Gressley as new U.N. emergency Ebola coordinator
[NPR, abridged, edited]
https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/06/04/726139304/an-urgent-mystery-whos-attacking-ebola-responders-in-congo-and-why


David Gressly is not a medical expert. But he has just taken on what has to be one of the toughest jobs in global health.

On 23 May 2019, the United Nations' secretary-general named Gressly to a new position overseeing the organization's effort to stop the 10-month-long Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of the Congo. (His official title is U.N. emergency Ebola coordinator.)

Until then, Gressly had been deputy head of the U.N. mission in Congo, which includes a massive force of peacekeepers. His appointment amounts to a recognition by the U.N. that it's no longer an option to leave coordination of the international Ebola response solely to its health officials, specifically the staff of the World Health Organization. That's because the biggest obstacle to ending the outbreak is a problem that WHO officials say has ballooned beyond their purview to address: Since late February 2019, there's been a dramatic surge in violent -- and sometimes deadly -- attacks against Ebola response teams.

The violence keeps forcing Ebola responders to pause key activities such as identifying and treating people infected with the virus, vaccinating their contacts and safely burying those who die of the disease. The result has been a spike in infections. Since mid-March 2019, the new case count has jumped from about 25 per week to more than 120 in some weeks. And the total number of cases over the 10 months of the outbreak has just topped 2000.

Perhaps the biggest challenge to ending the violence is that it's still not entirely clear who is behind it and why. Reached by phone in Congo, Gressly said that understanding the dynamics driving the violence will be "essential" to his mission: "It's important to figure that out at a detailed, granular level." But like many local and international observers in Congo, he said it's already clear that "it's not just a simple matter of [local people] not understanding the importance of the [Ebola] response. It goes much deeper and may have political or economic reasons behind it."

Whether their motivations are financial or political, the assailants who are mounting the organized attacks pose a particular problem for aid workers like the IRC's Tariq Riebl. Six members of his organization were caught up in the attack in which the WHO epidemiologist was killed. "Three were able to get out quickly," said Riebl. "But 3 more were trapped for hours."

In the aftermath, he said, it's hard to know how to keep his teams safe. When it comes to the attacks by ordinary people in the community who are simply misinformed, "you can mitigate it, do community outreach, improve your communication strategy, discuss with communities what their troubles are and usually you can resolve these things," said Riebl. But when attackers seem to be targeting aid workers as part of a larger strategy, "you can't negotiate with people that have these sorts of intents."

Gressly said he'd like to try. And he said he plans to draw on several tools from the U.N. mission in Congo not available to the WHO officials who had been heading up the response: "We have civil affairs officers who maintain really close relationships with communities. We work with them all the time. That gives us a level of access to the population that WHO could never match."

He also plans to build on his prior role mediating between the government and Mai Mai militias. The idea, said Gressly, is "to work basically as an impartial entity between the 2 to find solutions that allow these groups to re-enter society." Even just getting those kinds of negotiations underway could have a calming influence on violence, he said. And of course, he added, if necessary "we can deploy forces."

Gressly said one of his objectives is to "end impunity for these kinds of actions." He noted that the U.N. has specialized support teams that can help Congolese prosecutors with their investigations. And he said he intends to deploy them in pursuit of the sponsors of the organized attacks on Ebola teams, including the killing of the WHO epidemiologist, who was a U.N. employee.

"We have a strong policy for our own personnel -- U.N. personnel -- that we want to pursue these cases and see justice done," he said. "And if there's a requirement to follow this up a chain of command, then that's what we want to see as well. We will continue to do so until we feel that justice has been done."

[WHO is elevating an individual who is intimately familiar with the endemic violent forces in the area, rather than a health official, to be the U.N. Ebola coordinator. This is de facto recognition that controlling the violence and easing the unrest is the key to quelling the epidemic. Hopefully Mr. Gressley's experience and contacts both within and outside of the DRC government, and the resources at his disposal, will make a real difference and obviate the need for declaring a PHEIC (Public Health Emergency of International Concern) - Mod.LXL
