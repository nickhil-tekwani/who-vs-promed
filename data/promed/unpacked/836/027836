A team of 30 scientists and assistants killed 19 cape buffalo in Kruger
National Park and performed autopsies in the field to study the prevalence
of bovine tuberculosis in the herd. [At least one animal with gross
lesions was found as they were able to
demonstrate such lesions that evening to the accompanying journalist(s).
Tuberculosis is not a natural disease for the herd. The buffalo are
thought to have contracted it by mingling with infected cattle herds prior
to fencing of the park's southern boundary in the 1950s. The disease
progresses slowly in buffalo, but is more rapidly progressive in feline
park predators. Lions and leopards are among the species known to have
been affected in Kruger National Park.
The disease has also hit lions in two other game parks, including one in
Uganda, adding urgency to finding a solution. Park officials have described
tuberculosis as a slow and insidious disease, but for wild animal
populations, the problem can be out of hand before it is recognized.
It is probably hitting many more African game reserves, but few studies
have been done because of lack of money, said Leo Braack, chief of
conservation at Kruger. "Hopefully the insight we gain [from this study
can benefit a whole range of countries," Braack said.
