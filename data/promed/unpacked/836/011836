Mexico: New Inspections Planned Following Contaminated Green Onions Incident
--------------------------------------------------
Mexico will follow its closure of 4 green onion growers linked to a
hepatitis [A] outbreak in the United States with more intensive
inspections aimed at boosting consumer confidence in the country's
produce, a top agricultural official said on Tue 25 Nov 2003. The
move will also aid growers by improving the image of their crops at
home and abroad, Javier Trujillo, director of the Agriculture
Department's division of health, safety and quality, said in an
interview with Associated Press. "It will help in large measure to
generate confidence that if something has made it to the marketplace,
it's the direct result of having met hygiene standards," Trujillo
said.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned imports from the 4
scallion [green onion] growers after identifying them as a possible
source for the hepatitis A outbreak that has killed at least 4 people
and sickened hundreds in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Tennessee, and North
Carolina. Mexico has some 22 other producers of green onions whose
exports are not affected.
Trujillo said the situation has prompted the government to move up a
plan to inspect growers on a regular basis by region instead of
conducting spot inspections of individual companies and products only
after reports of trouble. At a meeting in Washington earlier this
month, agricultural officials from the United States and Mexico
discussed the new inspections.
But the hepatitis outbreak has now made that effort more critical,
Trujillo said, adding Mexico now hopes to submit a plan for
implementing the program by the end of 2003. The official said the
government closed the 4 growers, including 3 owned by U.S.-based
companies, in the states of Baja California and Sonora because they
did not comply with health standards. "We concluded after our
inspections that if the (tainted onions) were indeed Mexican, these
companies had the greatest probability of having caused the
contamination," he said. The FDA will send a team to Mexico on Sunday
to work with local authorities in trying to determine how the
scallions became contaminated, said John Guzewich, director of
emergency coordination and response at the agency's Center for Food
Safety and Applied Nutrition.

and the outbreaks in Pennsylvania and elsewhere earlier still appears
to be circumstantial, based on the supply chain rather than on
detection of hepatitis A virus contamination at source. - Mod.CP]
