Duncan Maughan has already lost 125 of his dairy cows -- half his herd -- after they were blighted by an incurable condition.

The farmer, of Cumrew, near Brampton [England], is within days of slaughtering the remaining 125 -- and he'll get no financial compensation for his losses.

The father-of-2 is worried he will lose his home as his family reaches breaking point, unable to find support anywhere. Mr Maughan's cattle have contracted _Mycoplasma bovis_, and a rarer strain of the disease, _Mycoplasma wenyonii_, for which there is no cure.

The dairyman, 41, whose family has farmed at Gateshawmill Farm for more than 70 years, has been fighting for nearly 2 years to find a way out of the crisis.

He told The Cumberland News: "We've been struggling with sick and crippled cows, unexplained deaths, low yields and poor fertility."

The disease is known to be associated with mastitis, arthritis, meningitis, eye infections, abortion and infertility.

Infected animals may slowly deteriorate, become chronically ill, or even die.

"We've had times when it was impossible to get the cows in for milking. Their joints were so stiff they just couldn't take a single step," said Mr Maughan.

But because there are currently no known effective treatments for the disease, Mr Maughan has felt helpless to stop it.

"It is soul destroying. The mental anguish is killing us. It has gone on so long we have shed our last tear and we need to make decisions," he added.

Mr Maughan also questions whether the disease could lead to behavioural problems in bulls after one of his prize Herefords attacked his 68-year-old father, John, and put him in hospital.

"The bull just turned on him when he went to fetch in the cows. It knocked him down and pinned him against the wall and was head-butting him. Luckily I heard him shouting, and pulled him out. It did break his jaw, but it could have been worse."

Mr Maughan said the industry needed to wake up to the fact that the disease is a major threat to dairy herds.

"Its insidious nature is masking how many herds have it and its rate of spread. It has brought my business to its knees," he said.

The herd's outbreak has caused severe arthritis, preventing cows walking or standing, inflamed udders with open sores, abscesses on the hips as well as swollen hocks and feet.

"It's cost us over [GDP] 1 million in lost stock, tests, vet's bills, vaccines and feed. A combination of antibiotics and overfeeding seemed to help, but then a short while later we faced the same picture. The disease seemed to build up a resistance to antibiotic treatment."

Mr Maughan said his vet had done everything he could to help, but cries for help from Government officials and vets had failed.

"I have even gone to the top, and they have just ignored me. Not one vet from the Animal Health and Laboratories Agency has set foot on this farm," said Mr Maughan.

The disease is transmitted between animals, but Mr Maughan keeps his cows as far away as possible from neighbouring farms. He added: "The authorities just don't want to know. They don't want to start a panic situation. If I had foot-and-mouth [disease] or bovine TB [tuberculosis], I would be entitled to compensation.

"I have a land agency coming to value the farm and the land. What choice do I have? But where will that leave our family? I cannot afford to start up again and where would we live? The cost of replacing all my herd is out of the question."

[_Mycoplasma bovis_ is a pathogen causing respiratory disease, otitis media [inflammation of the middle ear], arthritis, mastitis [infection of the mammary gland and udder tissue], and a variety of other diseases in cattle worldwide. It is increasingly recognized by the veterinary and livestock communities as having an important impact on the health, welfare, and productivity of dairy and beef cattle. _M. bovis_ diseases can be difficult to diagnose and control because of inconsistent disease expression and response to treatments and vaccines, and large gaps in the current understanding of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of these diseases, which tend to become chronic and do not respond well to antibiotic treatments.

Less is known about _Mycoplasma wenyonii_, an enigmatic and incompletely understood organism, while there is growing body of evidence suggesting that it may contribute to clinical signs in cattle, particularly in dairy cows, during late summer and early autumn. Arthropods and events involving blood contact are suspected to be involved in transmission. The described clinical signs include pyrexia [fever], hindlimb and/or udder oedema and prefemoral lymphadenopathy [enlarged lymph nodes].

It deserves to be investigated if a combination of both pathogens is behind the unusual severe picture reportedly observed in the dairy farm described. Could additional factors play a role?

Both agents are not intra-nationally reportable, and are not OIE-listed, thus not under internationally agreed requirements for international trade in animals. Both pathogens are not zoonotic.

Subscribers with experience in similar events are invited to share their view.
