African swine fever [ASF] has been identified on a private farm in the republic of Karelia following the deaths of 8 animals. The study of pathological material taken from the dead pigs revealed the presence of ASF.

Preliminary results of the investigation stated that the most likely source of infection is from pre-fabricated food waste from the district hospitals and kindergartens.

Necessary measures have been undertaken to prevent the spread of infection.

[If confirmed, this will become the 1st ASF [African swine fever] outbreak in Karelia, a Russian republic bordering Finland on its west. During 2011, ASF was reported from 3 neighbouring oblasts: Murmansk (north, one outbreak), Arkhangelsk (east, 2 outbreaks) and Leningrad (south, 3 outbreaks). Those northern territories are suspected to have been infected by the introduction of contaminated material, transported from southern areas of Russia where ASF has already become endemic.

Since the start of the current, continuing ASF epizootic in Russia in September 2009, 174 foci have been reported involving domestic pigs and wild swine. Russia's 79 follow-up reports to the OIE and an interactive map showing all accumulated outbreaks are available at http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8462. In fact, the ASF epizootic had started earlier, namely in 2007, initially in Georgia, spreading to Chechnya and subsequently to vast parts of Russia, up to Murmansk in the extreme northwest part of Russia, not far from Russia's borders with Norway and Finland.

Confirmation of this suspected added outbreak and more details are anticipated. - Mod.AS]
