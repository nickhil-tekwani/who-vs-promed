Wisconsin horse dies of West Nile virus
---------------------------------------
A 4 year old quarter horse gelding in St Croix County, Wisconsin has died of West Nile virus (WNV) [infection], according to the Equine Disease Communication Center. The horse presented with signs of muscle weakness caused by nerve damage and was tested for WNV on 27 Jul 2016. The horse succumbed to the disease the following week. Testing confirmed WNV infection on 5 Aug 2016.

West Nile is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs for WNV include flu-like signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed; fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculations; hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound); changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they are daydreaming or "just not with it"; occasional somnolence (drowsiness); propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and "spinal" signs, including asymmetrical weakness. Some horses show asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia. Equine mortality rate can be as high as 30-40 per cent.

Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3- to 6-week period.

In addition to vaccination, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents.

North Dakota mule dies of West Nile virus
-----------------------------------------
West Nile is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Animal health authorities in North Dakota have confirmed a case of West Nile virus (WNV) in a Burleigh County mule. According to the Equine Disease Communication Center, the mule was euthanized due to neurologic clinical signs of the disease. The mule was not vaccinated against WNV.

The clinical signs of WNV can be consistent with other neurologic diseases such as equine encephalitis, rabies, and equine herpesvirus; therefore it is important to work with your veterinarian to get an accurate diagnosis through laboratory testing.

[We don't very often hear of other equines, but donkeys and mules are as susceptible to this disease horses are. The same clinical signs in horses are also seen in donkeys and mules. The same vaccine is effective.

Although West Nile virus (WNV) became an endemic disease in the United States many years ago, it is sad that animals suffer and may end up dead because a vaccine was not given. Prevention is a simple vaccine.

WNV is the leading cause of arbovirus encephalitis in horses and humans in the United States. Since 1999, over 25 000 cases of WNV encephalitis have been reported in US horses. Horses represent 96.9 per cent of all reported non-human mammalian cases of WNV disease.

This virus has been identified in all of the continental United States, most of Canada, and Mexico. Several Central and South American countries have also identified WNV within their borders. The virus is transmitted from avian reservoir hosts by mosquitoes (and infrequently by other bloodsucking insects) to horses, humans, and a number of other mammals. West Nile virus is transmitted by many different mosquito species and this varies geographically. The virus and mosquito host interactions result in regional change in virulence of the virus and no prediction can be made regarding future trends in local activity of the viruses. Horses and humans are considered to be dead-end hosts for WNV; the virus is not directly contagious from horse to horse or horse to human. Indirect transmission via mosquitoes from infected horses is highly unlikely as these horses do not circulate a significant amount of virus in their blood.

The case fatality rate for horses exhibiting clinical signs of WNV infection is about 33 per cent. Data have supported that 40 per cent of horses that survive the acute illness caused by WNV still exhibit residual effects, such as gait and behavioral abnormalities, 6 months post-diagnosis. Thus vaccination for West Nile virus is recommended as a core vaccine and is an essential standard of care for all horses in North America.

There are 3 challenge models that have been used to license currently available vaccines. The mosquito and needle challenge were the 2 models used in early studies. These challenge models result in 90 per cent of non-vaccinated control horses developing viremia, while only 10 per cent of these horses demonstrated clinical disease. More recently, the intrathecal (infection in the atlanto-occipital space) challenge model has been employed. In this model, 70 to 90 per cent of non-vaccinated control horses become viremic and 90 to 100 per cent develop grave signs of encephalomyelitis.

West Nile virus vaccines are licensed either as 1) an aid in prevention of viremia; 2) an aid in reduction of viremia, encephalitis, and clinical disease; 3) an aid in prevention of disease, viremia, and encephalitis; or 4) an aid in prevention of viremia and mortality, and an aid in reduction of severity of clinical disease.

Vaccines
--------
There are 4 USDA licensed vaccines currently available (2 are inactivated whole WNV vaccines; one is a non-replicating live canary pox recombinant vector vaccine, and one is an inactivated flavivirus chimera vaccine):

Inactivated whole virus vaccines with an adjuvant. Label instructions call for a primary vaccination series of 2 intramuscular injections administered 3 to 6 weeks apart followed by a 12-month revaccination interval. These products are labeled as an aid in prevention of viremia or as an aid in prevention of viremia and mortality and an aid in reduction of severity of clinical disease.

Recombinant canary pox vaccine with protective antigens expressed in a vaccine strain canary pox vector which does not replicate in the horse. The vaccine contains an adjuvant. Label instructions call for a primary vaccination series of 2 intramuscular injections administered 4 to 6 weeks apart, followed by a 12-month revaccination interval. The product is labeled as an aid in prevention of disease, viremia, and encephalitis.

Inactivated flavivirus chimera vaccine with protective antigens expressed in a vaccine strain yellow fever virus vector and contains an adjuvant. Label instructions call for a primary vaccination series of 2 intramuscular injections administered 3 to 4 weeks apart followed by a 12-month revaccination interval. This product is labeled as an aid in reduction of disease, encephalitis and viremia.

All of the current WNV vaccine products carry 1 year duration of immunity, with challenge, consistent with their respective label claims.

Vaccination schedules
---------------------
Adult horses previously vaccinated: Vaccinate annually in the spring, prior to the onset of the insect vector season.

For animals at high risk or with limited immunity, more frequent vaccination or appropriately timed revaccination is recommended in order to induce protective immunity during periods of likely exposure. For instance, juvenile horses (younger than 5 years of age) appear to be more susceptible than adult horses that have likely been vaccinated and/or had subclinical exposure. Geriatric horses (older than 15 years of age) have been demonstrated to have enhanced susceptibility to WNV disease. Therefore, more frequent vaccination may be recommended to meet the vaccination needs of these horses.

Booster vaccinations are warranted according to local disease or exposure risk. However, more frequent vaccination may be indicated with any of these products depending on risk assessment.

Adult horses previously unvaccinated or having unknown vaccinal history:
Inactivated whole virus vaccine: a primary series of 2 doses is administered to naïve horses. A 4 to 6 week interval between doses is recommended. The label recommended revaccination interval is 12 months.

Recombinant canary pox vector vaccine: a primary series of 2 doses is administered to naïve horses with a 4 to 6 week interval between doses. The label recommended revaccination interval is 12 months.

Inactivated flavivirus chimera vaccine: a primary series of 2 doses is administered to naïve horses. A 3 to 4 week interval between doses is recommended. The label recommended revaccination interval is 12 months.

Pregnant mares:
Limited studies have been performed that examine vaccinal protection against WNV disease in pregnant mares. While none of the licensed vaccines are specifically labeled for administration to pregnant mares at this time, practitioners have vaccinated pregnant mares due to the risk of natural infection. It is an accepted practice by many veterinarians to administer WNV vaccines to pregnant mares as the risk of adverse consequences of WNV infection outweighs any reported adverse effects of use of vaccine.

Pregnant mare previously vaccinated:
Vaccinate at 4 to 6 weeks before foaling.

Pregnant mares previously unvaccinated:
Initiate a primary vaccination series (see adult horses previously unvaccinated) immediately. Limited antibody response was demonstrated in pregnant mares vaccinated for the 1st time with the originally licensed inactivated, whole virus vaccine. It is unknown if this is true for the other products. Vaccination of naïve mares while open is a preferred strategy.

Foals:
Limited studies have been performed examining maternal antibody inference and inhibition of protection against WNV disease. The only data currently available is for the originally licensed, inactivated whole virus product in which foals were demonstrated to produce antibody in response to vaccination despite the presence of maternal antibody. No studies have been performed evaluating protection from disease in foals vaccinated in the face of maternal immunity.

Foals of vaccinated mares:
Inactivated whole virus vaccines: administer a primary 3-dose series beginning at 4 to 6 months of age. A 4 to 6 week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses is recommended. The 3rd dose should be administered at 10 to 12 months of age prior to the onset of the next mosquito season.

Data indicate that maternal antibodies do not interfere with the originally licensed, inactivated whole virus vaccine; however protection from clinical disease has not been provocatively tested in foals less than 6 months of age. Animals may be vaccinated more frequently with these products if risk assessment warrants.

Recombinant canary pox vector vaccine: administration of a 3-dose primary vaccination series beginning at 4 to 6 months of age. There should be a 4-week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses. The 3rd dose should be administered at 10 to 12 months of age prior to the onset of the next mosquito season.

There are no data for the recombinant canary pox vector vaccine regarding maternal antibody interference. Protection from clinical disease has not been provocatively tested in foals less than 6 months of age. Animals may be vaccinated more frequently with this product if risk assessment warrants.

Inactivated flavivirus chimera vaccine: administration of a 3-dose primary vaccination series beginning at 4-6 months of age. There should be a 4-week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses. The 3rd dose should be administered at 10 to 12 months of age prior to the onset of the next mosquito season.

There are no data for the inactivated flavivirus chimera vaccine regarding maternal antibody interference. Protection from clinical disease has not been provocatively tested in foals less than 6 months of age. Animals may be vaccinated more frequently with this product if risk assessment warrants.

Foals of unvaccinated mares:
The primary series of vaccinations should be initiated at 3 to 4 months of age and, where possible, be completed prior to the onset of the high-risk insect vector season.

Inactivated whole virus vaccines: administer a primary series of 3 doses with a 30-day interval between the 1st and 2nd doses and a 60-day interval between the 2nd and 3rd doses. If the primary series is initiated during the mosquito vector season, an interval of 3 to 4 weeks between the 2nd and 3rd doses is preferable to the above described interval of 8 weeks.

Data indicate that maternal antibodies do not interfere with the originally licensed product; however protection from clinical disease has not been provocatively tested in foals less than 6 months of age. Animals may be vaccinated more frequently with these products if risk assessment warrants.

Recombinant canary pox vaccine: administer a primary series of 3 doses with a 30-day interval between the 1st and 2nd doses and a 60-day interval between the 2nd and 3rd doses. If the primary series is initiated during the mosquito vector season, an interval of 3 to 4 weeks between the 2nd and 3rd doses is preferable to the above described interval of 8 weeks.

There are no data for this product regarding maternal antibody interference. Protection from clinical disease has not been provocatively tested in foals less than 6 months of age. Animals may be vaccinated more frequently with this product if risk assessment warrants.

Inactivated flavivirus chimera vaccine: administer a primary series of 3 doses with a 30-day interval between the 1st and 2nd doses and a 60-day interval between the 2nd and 3rd doses. If the primary series is initiated during the mosquito vector season, an interval of 3 to 4 weeks between the 2nd and 3rd doses is preferable to the above described interval of 8 weeks.

There are no data for this product regarding maternal antibody interference. Protection from clinical disease has not been provocatively tested in foals less than 6 months of age. Animals may be vaccinated more frequently with this product if risk assessment warrants.

Horses having been naturally infected and recovered:
Recovered horses likely develop life-long immunity, but this has not been confirmed. Consider revaccination if the immune status of the animal changes the risk for susceptibility to infection or at the recommendation of the attending veterinarian. Examples of these conditions would include the long-term use of corticosteroids and pituitary adenoma.
