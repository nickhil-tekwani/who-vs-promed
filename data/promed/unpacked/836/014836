The Food and Drug Administration is warning pet owners Midwestern Pet Foods, Inc.'s products have been "associated with the illness or death of hundreds of pets who had eaten the company's dry dog food."

The FDA said Tuesday [17 Aug 2021] it has issued a warning letter to the Evansville, Indiana, family-owned company because inspections of manufacturing plants revealed evidence of violations.

As of 9 Aug [2021], the federal agency said it was aware of "more than 130 pet deaths and more than 220 pet illnesses that may be linked to eating brands of pet food manufactured by Midwestern," which may contain potentially unsafe levels of aflatoxin, a byproduct of mold.

"The FDA is dedicated to taking all steps possible to help pet owners have confidence the food they buy for their animal companions is safe and wholesome," Steven Solomon, director of the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine, said in a statement. "Samples of dog food were found to contain high levels of aflatoxin."

Aflatoxin is a toxin that can grow on corn and other grains used in pet food, according to the FDA. At high levels, aflatoxin can cause illness and death in pets.

Pets experiencing aflatoxin poisoning may have the following clinical signs: sluggishness, loss of appetite, vomiting, jaundice (a yellowish tint to the skin, eyes, or gums [and inner parts of the ear - Mod.TG] due to liver damage), and diarrhea.

"Not all of these cases have been confirmed as aflatoxin poisoning through laboratory testing or veterinary record review," the FDA's statement said Tuesday [17 Aug 2021]. "This count is approximate and may not reflect the total number of pets affected."

Midwestern Pet Foods didn't immediately respond to USA Today's request for comment Tuesday [17 Aug 2021].

In December [2020], the pet food manufacturer recalled several types of its dog food, and the recall was expanded in January [2021]. Sportsmix products were among the recalled items.

The FDA said in December [2020] it was aware of 28 deaths and 8 illnesses in dogs having eaten the recalled product. The number increased to more than 70 dog deaths in January [2021].

The FDA said Tuesday [17 Aug 2021] it has requested a "written response from the company within 15 working days stating the specific steps they have taken to correct any violations. Failure to adequately address any violations promptly may result in legal action, including product seizure and/or injunction."

"It is imperative that manufacturers and distributors of pet foods understand their responsibility to comply with all requirements of federal law and FDA regulations and, when applicable, to implement a robust hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls program," Solomon said in his statement. "We'll continue to hold companies accountable and protect animal health as a core element of the FDA's public health mission."

In March [2021], Midwestern Pet Foods had a recall because of possible _Salmonella_ contamination.

"The FDA found Midwestern's food safety program appears inadequate to significantly minimize or prevent _Salmonella_ in its pet food," the FDA said Tuesday [17 Aug 2021] of the March [2021] recall. "None of the recalled products should be available to consumers to purchase."

[Signs of aflatoxicosis in dogs include the following:
- bloody vomiting or diarrhea
- general lethargy
- loss of appetite
- increased water consumption and urination
- jaundice or yellowing of the whites of the eyes or gums or inside of the ears, especially in cats

In severe cases, or if left untreated, aflatoxin can cause death.

Although aflatoxin has been associated with cancer in people, it does not cause cancer in dogs. Dogs do not live long enough to develop any kind of cancer associated with aflatoxin.

Dogs (and cats) are sensitive to low-level long-term intake. Although the clinical signs listed above are correct, it is important to realize there are other illnesses that cause the same signs. It is important to have your pet evaluated by a veterinarian if there are signs of illness.

If you have purchased any of the food that has been recalled (see recall list at https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/outbreaks-and-advisories/fda-alert-certain-lots-sportmix-pet-food-recalled-potentially-fatal-levels-aflatoxin), please discard it. Do not feed this recalled food to your pet(s). Please take your pet to a veterinarian for a complete check-up, including necessary blood work. - Mod.TG
