On 24 and 25 Oct 2005, 5 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)
were reported to the Institut de Veille Sanitaire (InVS) by
pediatricians at 2 separate hospitals in southwest France. The 5
patients lived in 2 neighboring administrative departments.

An investigation was begun in collaboration with the district public
health offices, the interregional epidemiology centers, the national
reference laboratories for _Escherichia coli_, the ministries of
agriculture and health, the national school for veterinary medicine
in Lyon, the ministry of the economy and consumer protection, and the
hospitals involved.

An outbreak case of HUS was defined as a resident of one of the
departments in southwest France who developed HUS on or after 20 Sep
2005. HUS was defined as acute hemolytic anemia (hemoglobin less
than 10g/100mL with evidence of red cell fragmentation) and acute
renal failure (at least one of the following symptoms:
creatinine greater than 60 micromol/L if aged less than 2 years, 70
micromol/L if aged 2 years or more [to convert creatinine in
micromole/L to mg/dL, one must multiply by a factor of 0.11 -
Mod.LL] and/or hematuria greater than 20 000 cells/mL (or = ++)
and/or proteinuria greater than 1g/L.

A probable case of verotoxin-producing _E. coli_ acute
gastroenteritis (VTEC-GEA) with bloody diarrhea was defined as a
person in southwest France with bloody diarrhea whose symptoms began
on or after 20 Sep 2005.

As a first step to identify cases, all hospitals in southwest France,
the 22 medical laboratories in the most affected department (les
Landes) and all general practitioners and pediatricians in the
communities where cases occurred were contacted. Patients, or their
parents, were interviewed with a trawling questionnaire about
consumption of food and drink, contact with animals (domestic, farm,
zoo), contact with other cases of diarrhea, activities (school,
leisure) and other possible sources of exposure (such as travel or
visits to lakes) during the 7 days before onset of diarrhea.

Results
--------
By 2 Nov 2005, 13 cases of HUS and 13 probable cases of VTEC-GEA with
bloody diarrhea had been identified. Symptom onset dates ranged
between 5 and 29 Oct 2005, with 18 cases (69 percent) reporting onset
of symptoms between 18 and 24 Oct 2005 (Figure 1) [for figures, refer
to original URL - Mod.LL].

17 patients were resident in the department of Landes, 3 in Pyrenees
Atlantiques, 1 in Hautes Pyrenees, 4 in Lot-et-Garonne and 1 in Gers
(Figure 2). 14 male patients and 12 female patients were affected,
aged between 15 months and 49 years. 24 (92 percent) cases were in
children under the age of 9. The 13 HUS cases were in children aged
between 15 months and 9 years.

All patients with HUS and 7 with VTEC-GEA were admitted to hospital.
No deaths have occurred. To date, _E coli_ 0157:H7 infection has been
confirmed in 10 cases. In 3 cases, the isolates were shown to be
positive for the genes stx1, stx2, and eae.

Analysis of the questionnaires showed that the only exposure common
to all cases was the consumption of minced beefburgers. All 26 cases
had consumed from the brand 'Chantegrill' beefburgers, which had been
purchased as boxes of 10 deep-frozen beefburgers at 12 different E.
Leclerc supermarkets in southwest France. 16 boxes of the
beefburgers were recovered from the homes of 15 of the patients. 2
batch numbers were identified from these boxes: batch 231/234 on 15
boxes and batch 206 on one box. The family who identified the only
box from batch 206 also had a box from batch 231/234. A limited
number of boxes from these batches had also been distributed to a
supermarket in Pamplona in Spain and several E. Leclerc supermarkets
in Portugal.

PCR testing on samples from 5 beefburgers of batch 231/234 recovered
from one freezer where a patient lived, and samples stocked by the
supermarket chain, has been positive for _E coli_ O157:H7. The
strains tested positive for stx1 and stx2. Further characterization
of the isolates is ongoing, particularly for the presence of the eae gene.

Control measures
------------------
On 29 Oct 2005, the E. Leclerc supermarket withdrew all Chantegrill
minced beefburgers from sale in France, Spain and Portugal, and
issued a recall of the batches 206 and 231/234 on 30 Oct. The recall
has been communicated to the public through television, radio and the
press, and notices in E. Leclerc supermarkets. E. Leclerc
supermarkets have identified 95 percent of the customers who had
purchased the incriminated batches using data from supermarket
loyalty cards and through the bankcards and cheques used for payment.
Starting from 30 Oct 2005, a team of 750 employees are contacting
these customers by phone to inform them not to consume the beefburgers.

Consumers have been advised to return boxes of minced beefburgers
from the incriminated batches to the supermarket and to contact a
physician if they develop symptoms of acute gastroenteritis. European
alerts were sent out via the Early Warning and Response System and
Enter-net (International surveillance network for the enteric
infections Salmonella and VTEC O157,
<http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpa/inter/enter-net_menu.htm>)

Ongoing investigations
-----------------------
The incriminated batches were produced by a major beefburger
manufacturer. Batch 231/234 corresponds to a single day of
production. A traceback investigation is ongoing to determine the
origin (breeders and abattoirs) of the carcasses used for beefburger
production. An inspection is being carried at the manufacturing
plant, and the exact quantities of beefburgers that have been
exported are being determined and will be communicated to the
countries concerned through the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed
(RASFF, <http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/food/rapidalert/index_en.htm>).

Medical professionals and district health offices have been requested
to report all people who developed acute gastroenteritis symptoms
within 2 weeks of consumption of Chantegrill beefburgers, and to send
stool samples for VTEC analysis.

Discussion
-----------
This is the 1st community-wide outbreak of _E. coli_ O157 to be
reported in France. Surveillance of HUS cases in France began in
1996, and is based on 30 nationally distributed pediatric nephrology
units that notify, on a voluntary basis, pediatric cases of HUS to
the national institute of public health. Annually, between 70 and 100
cases are reported, and of those, 57 percent have a
laboratory-confirmed VTEC infection. 90 percent of
laboratory-confirmed HUS cases are infected with _E. coli_ O157. A
recent case-control study on risk factors for VTEC-confirmed HUS in
France identified undercooked minced beefburgers as a major risk
factor, accounting for an estimated 53 percent of HUS cases in
children (InVS, data not yet published).

[To be able to identify 95 percent of the customers who purchased the
batches in question is a tribute to the identification system and
ability to trace purchases by payment records.

Stx1 and stx 2 are the 2 major shigella toxin genes that can be
produced by O157. Not all strains have the gene sequence for both.
The eae gene produces a virulence factor, intimin, which enables the
_E. coli_ strain to attach to the surface of the epithelial cell with
removal (effacing) of the microvilli. - Mod.LL]
