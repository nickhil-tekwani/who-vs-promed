H1N1 In California Turkey Flock
-------------------------------
The California Animal Health and Food Safety (CAHFS) Laboratory has
identified the presence of the H1N1 influenza virus in a turkey
breeding flock in California's Central Valley, the American
Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) has learned today [6 Jan 2010].

The CAHFS Laboratory confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza infection on 28
Dec 2009, by testing of samples taken from the infected flock. There
had been no clinical signs of illness in the flock other than a
decrease in egg production.

Although the State of California has not officially quarantined the
facility, the producer has imposed a self quarantine until further
testing has been completed. Samples were forwarded to the National
Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, for additional
confirmatory testing.

In the United States, turkeys have previously tested positive for the
H1N1 virus in Virginia. They have also tested positive in Canada and Chile.

In addition, the virus has been identified in pigs, cats, ferrets, and a dog.

[If turkeys in other countries are any indication, this flock will
recover without any adverse effects. This article does not tell us
how the flock was diagnosed. However, in other flocks there have been
behavior changes and a decrease in egg production. - Mod.TG]
