Brazilian biologists are investigating the deaths of more than 500 penguins found washed up on the beaches of Rio Grande do Sul state. Autopsies are being conducted on some of the birds to determine the cause of death.

Researchers said the penguins appeared to have been well-fed, with no apparent injuries and no oil on their bodies. Similar incidents in the past have been blamed on shifting ocean currents and colder temperatures.

Magellanic penguins migrate to southern Brazil from Patagonia every year during the southern winter.

Last week [week of 2 Jul 2012], dozens of young penguins were rescued from beaches in Rio de Janeiro after straying far beyond their normal range. The birds delighted beach-goers, but scientists said their health was suffering in the tropical waters.

Brazil's environment agency is preparing to fly those penguins back to the south.

[Magellanic penguins migrate from Patagonia reaching northern Argentina, Uruguay, and southern Brazil on their winter migration, in parallel with the seasonal pulse of anchovy spawning. There was a previous die-off episode in 2008, when Magellanic penguins went further north than usual. Many died, and a few swam nearly to the Equator. Then, penguins were dehydrated, anemic, hypothermic, and emaciated, which does not seem to be the case now. In the winter of 2008, sea surface temperature was unusually cold, perhaps reducing prey availability for penguins. Again in 2009, a new die-off was recorded along the coast of Sao Paulo (ProMED archive 20100721.2447). The investigation carried out then pointed to starvation as the main cause.
