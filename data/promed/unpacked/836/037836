In January 2012, a human case of brucellosis was diagnosed by blood culture in a district of the French Alps. The isolated strain was identified as _Brucella melitensis_ biovar 3. The patient had presented in late November 2011 with non-specific symptoms that had been ongoing since that date. Usual at-risk exposures were investigated: recent or ancient travel in an endemic/enzootic country, consumption of raw milk or raw milk products imported from an enzootic country, professional or accidental exposure to _Brucella_ strains in a laboratory, direct contact with animals, etc. As the patient had not had such an exposure at any point before, the case was considered to be an autochthonous case of acute brucellosis of undetermined origin.

In April 2012, brucellosis was confirmed in a dairy cow in a herd of the same district of the French Alps. The seropositive cow had aborted in late January 2012, and a strain of _Brucella melitensis_ biovar 3 was isolated from the milk sampled from the animal. The animal belonged to a herd 21 dairy cows, and no other animal in the herd presented with symptoms suggesting brucellosis or showed any serological reaction. Approximately 20 kg of Reblochon cheese (soft raw milk cheese) are usually produced daily on the affected farm.

Brucellosis surveillance in France
----------------------------------
France has been officially free of brucellosis in cattle since 2005, and the last outbreak of brucellosis in sheep and goats was reported in 2003. In order to detect and prevent any re-emergence of the disease, annual screening using Rose Bengal test or complement fixation test is carried out in all cattle, sheep and goat farms producing raw milk as well as in all cattle herds, and every 1-3 years in small ruminant, according to EU regulations (1-4). Moreover, abortion in ruminants is mandatorily notifiable, and the investigation of abortion includes examination for brucellosis.

Human brucellosis in France is mandatorily notifiable. The National Reference Centre (NRC) determines the characteristics of _Brucella_ strains isolated from patients (5,6). Serological suspicions also have to be confirmed by the NRC, as the low specificity of available tests can be responsible for false-positive results. The confirmation is carried out using a combination of in-house tests including Rose Bengal test, immunoassay, complement fixation test, and specific detection of antibodies against _Yersinia enterocolitica_.

Veterinary investigation
------------------------
All animals were tested serologically (Rose Bengal test, complement fixation test and indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) before slaughter in April 2012 (5). Following French regulations, all animals in the infected herd were immediately slaughtered, and 3 pairs of lymph nodes (retropharyngeal, retromammary and internal iliac) were sampled from all animals for _Brucella_ culture (5) and PCR (7). All animals were seronegative with the exception of the index animal which showed a very strong reaction in all 3 tests. However, _Brucella_ was isolated from a 2nd animal in the herd, and PCR-positive results were obtained for 4 further animals, in addition to the index animal and the 2nd cow with an isolation of _Brucella_.

Following the confirmation of brucellosis in the cow, a trace-back investigation was implemented by the veterinary services to determine the origin of the contamination of the herd. The animals of the infected herd had not taken part in a transhumance nor did they graze with other herds on the same pastures. Other neighboring farms as well as farms that had traded animals with the infected farm in the year before the outbreak were investigated. All tested negative in serology (5).

A trace-forward investigation was also carried out to determine the places of distribution of cheese produced at the affected farm since the abortion of the cow.

Reblochon cheese is a raw milk soft cheese, requiring a maturation period of 3 weeks to one month. The cheese from the affected farm had been commercialized after the abortion in 7 districts. Cheese was sold directly at the farm, and as whole pieces or in parts in supermarkets. Cheese produced by the affected farm had not been exported to other countries but might have been bought by foreign tourists during their winter holidays in several ski resorts in the area. For this reason, the European rapid alert system for food and feed (RASFF) was informed.

Human investigations
--------------------
After the identification of the 1st bovine case, the human case was interviewed again to investigate any direct or indirect epidemiological link with the infected herd. During the 2nd interview, it became clear that the patient and their family had visited the infected farm in autumn 2011, although it was not possible to determine the exact date. During this visit, the family had bought Tome Blanche cheese, a fresh cheese obtained during the 1st step of Reblochon production. The 4 family members had shared the Tome Blanche on the same day, but the index case was the only one who later presented with symptoms. The other 3 family members were serologically investigated in May 2012 and only one had a positive high agglutination titer. The farm reported no other visitors during that period, apart from neighbors.

Microbiological investigations
------------------------------
The strain isolated from the human case and from the 2 cows both belonged to _Brucella melitensis_ biovar 3. The strains had the same genotype as determined by multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) (8).

Control measures
----------------
All cheese pieces produced by the affected farm and still within the shelf life were withdrawn from retailers. In addition, a recall of already sold products was carried out via a national press release by the cheese producer and by posters in the sale points. Medical doctors in the concerned districts were informed by the regional health authorities. Consumers of these products were advised to seek medical attention should they present symptoms consistent with brucellosis.

The release of cheese from the affected farm was immediately stopped. The movements of animals from other herds that had epidemiological links with the infected herd (those that were geographically close to the infected herd, or had been bought from the infected herd) have been restricted until the end of the investigation. Furthermore, raw cheese products from farms with epidemiological links to the infected farm were put on sale only after negative bacteriological tests results had been obtained.

Reinforcement of human surveillance
-----------------------------------
Notification of human brucellosis is mandatory in France. All notified human cases in France have to be confirmed by the national reference laboratory. From 2002 to 2011, 219 human cases were confirmed in France. Among them, 183 (84 percent) were patients infected through the consumption of raw milk products or direct contact with animals in (or from) countries with enzootic brucellosis; 14 (6 percent) were laboratory workers infected through the handling of _Brucella_ strains; 17 (8 percent) were relapses in people with past infection, while the origin of contamination could not be determined for 5 patients (2 percent) (9).

Because the investigation of the origin of the human case diagnosed in January 2012 had been inconclusive, it was decided to reinforce the surveillance immediately. Since January 2012, all notified suspected cases have been interviewed with a trawling questionnaire before the diagnosis was confirmed. Since April 2012, any epidemiological link with the infected herd has been systematically investigated. No other related human cases have been identified so far.

Discussion
----------
At this time, several hypotheses can be proposed to explain the re-emergence of brucellosis in cattle in France. One explanation is contact with infected cattle or small ruminants. Knowing that the affected herd had not received any imported animals, it needs to be investigated whether animals had been introduced in one of the herds that sold animals to the affected farm or whether the affected herd had been in contact with animals of neighboring farms. Another hypothesis would be a contamination of cattle by wildlife. Some chamois (_Rupicapra rupicapra_) were found infected with _B. melitensis_ biovar 3 in 1988 in the Alps, and some of these animals may have become chronically infected and not display symptoms (10). However, no infected chamois has been identified in the last 10 years, despite several serological surveys (Garin-Bastuji, personal communication, July 2012). _B. melitensis_ biovar 3 is the most common biovar isolated in ruminants worldwide, and therefore the identification of this biovar in a district like the French Alps with many different ruminant species cannot contribute to a more precise hypothesis.

The veterinary investigations are still ongoing to determine the origin of the contamination of the herd, to investigate the possible spread of the infection to other herds and to take control measures to avoid the infection of new herds and consequently the occurrence of additional human cases.

However, the absence of infected animals in the herds that are epidemiologically linked with the infected herd, and the absence of other autochthonous human cases argue in favor of a single outbreak and a limited episode. The index animal on the farm was born from a dam that itself was born in 1999 before the last outbreak in the area and died in 2006. The lifetime of the mother of the index infected animal is therefore consistent with the hypothesis of a congenital case of bovine brucellosis (11).

In addition to the investigations already carried out, all herds coming back from transhumance [the seasonal movement of people with their livestock between fixed summer and winter pastures - Mod.LL] in the concerned district will be serologically screened during the fall. Serological tests lack specificity, but they have a good sensitivity and are of good value to detect recent or active infections. The index animal had an active infection demonstrated by _Brucella_ excretion in milk. This animal displayed a high level of antibodies in relation with the active although possibly chronic infection. During the early investigation, a _Brucella_ strain and _Brucella_ DNA were detected in ganglions of seronegative animals, demonstrating chronic latent infections, with no antibodies. Strengthened surveillance of human and animal brucellosis will be maintained until the end of the investigations.

The surveillance of human brucellosis in nonendemic countries is complicated by the lack of specificity of serological tests (12-16). In our experience, all available tests still may cross-react with other bacteria (mainly _Y. enterocolitica_, but not only), and can also give false positive results in patients presenting with immune disorders. In countries with low prevalence and incidence of the disease, this low specificity contributes to the low positive predictive value of serology. A positive diagnosis has important consequences for the patients (long antimicrobial therapy with possible adverse effects and ecological consequences on intestinal bacteria), and for the dairy animals (culling of the entire herd in our country). It is therefore important to obtain as much evidence as possible to confirm a serological diagnosis.

[To highlight focal complications of _B. melitensis_, this Spanish citation and its abstract (Colmenero JD, Reguera JM, Martos F, et al: Complications associated with Brucella melitensis infection: a study of 530 cases. Medicine 1996;75:195-211) is presented:

We carried out a prospective study of 530 patients older than 14 years of age with brucellosis. We describe the incidence and clinical features of the focal forms of the disease, analyzing some of the possible factors associated with their appearance. 169 patients (31.9 percent) had a focal form or complication. Osteoarticular complications were the most frequent, totaling 113 cases (66 percent), followed by genitourinary with 18 cases (5.1 percent of males), hepatic (2.5 percent), neurologic (1.7 percent), and heart (1.5 percent). Nine patients (1.7 percent) had more than one complication. In a multivariate analysis, diagnostic delay greater than 30 days, ESR greater than 40 mm/hr, and levels of alpha-2 globulin greater than 7.5 g/L were statistically significant independent variables associated with the presence of focal forms.

25 patients with complications (14.8 percent) required surgical treatment. The relapse rate was 3.6 percent for those patients without complications and 4.1 percent for patients with focal forms (p greater than 0.05). However, when therapeutic failure, relapses, and mortality were considered together, the risk of an unfavorable evolution was significantly greater in patients with focal forms (10.6 percent versus 3.6 percent in patients without complications; p less than 0.005). Given the worse prognosis, knowledge and early diagnosis of the focal forms of _B. melitensis_ infection is especially important. - Mod.LL]

[The previous posting on this case was 20120414.1101283. Generally, the penetration of _B. melitensis_ into cattle farms is regarded as a spin-off from infected flocks of sheep and goats. Cattle infections are, in most cases, not associated with abortion storms. As observed in Israel, where -- similarly to Spain -- several dairy cattle farms got infected in previous years, the eradication of _B. melitensis_ from dairy cattle involved additional concerns in comparison to the eradication of _B. abortus_. Humans easily contract _B. melitensis_ due to the extremely low inoculum dose required. Since the bacteria are excreted in the milk, which in the cow are produced in large quantities, the requirement to remove the udder and internal organs from slaughtered cows would necessarily lead to exposure of the abattoir personnel to huge amounts of the organisms. Therefore, in Israel, it was recommended to dry-off suspected cows prior to sending them to slaughter. - Mod.AS]
