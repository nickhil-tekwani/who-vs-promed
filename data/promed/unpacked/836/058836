Cows catch anthrax in Chechnya, no threat of spread
---------------------------------------------------
Three cows have died in an anthrax outbreak in the Republic of Chechnya, in
Russia's North Caucasus, but there is no threat of the disease spreading,
the local epidemiology center said on Wednesday [22 Nov 2006].
The owner of the cows, a resident of the village of Rubezhnoye in the
Naursky district in northern Chechnya, discovered the deaths on 17 Nov 2006.
The cows have been incinerated.
The republic's veterinary and anti-epidemic services have taken necessary
preventive measures. Persons who came into contact with the dead cattle have
been inoculated and their clothes burned, the center said.

[That the authorities saw fit to both inoculate the "persons who came into
contact with the dead cattle" and burn their clothes suggests that the
outbreak was reported after the 3rd death, when the owner probably had 2nd
thoughts about butchering the earlier dead animals --tha is, their clothes
were bloody when the authorities turned up. November is very late for this
disease. Although it is described year round, it is essentially a hot summer
month disease. Winter cases occur either through contaminated feed (which
could include muddy, poor quality hay harvested in a field with an old
anthrax grave) or seasonal movement of stock when grazing is thin and sparse
on the "green road" and in areas with past anthrax cases. Thank you, Brent.
