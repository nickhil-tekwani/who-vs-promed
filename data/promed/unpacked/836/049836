IFST POSITION STATEMENT ON BSE, UPDATE 27 MARCH 1996
====================================================
Herewith, as promised, the Institute of Food Science & Technology's
Position Statement update of 27 March 1996.
BOVINE SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHY (BSE)

The Institute of Food Science & Technology, through its Public Affairs
and Technical & Legislative Committees, has authorised the following
Position Statement, dated 27 March 1996, updating the previous
Statement of 6 February 1996, and replacing any previous version :-
Summary
BSE is an extremely serious disease of cattle, the eradication of
which is of primary importance to safeguard herds, and hence future
supply of dairy and bovine meat products for the human and pet food
chains, together with important bovine by-products.
For there to be any risk to humans consuming beef, two conditions
would both have to be fulfilled: that BSE could be transmitted from
cows to humans; and that parts of the animal capable of carrying the
infective agent could enter the human food chain.
As to the first, there is no direct scientific evidence that BSE can
be transmitted from cows to humans, and some research evidence
suggesting that it cannot. Nevertheless, the emergence during the past
two years of ten anomalous cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) in
a previously unrecognised pattern, led, in the absence of other
explanation at present, to the conjecture that they were likely to
have been caused by exposure to infected cattle brain or spinal cord
before 1989 (at which time they were banned from the food chain) and
to a judgement that, if there is any risk to humans, it is extremely
small, and no greater for children, hospital patients, pregnant women
or people who are immuno-compromised.
As to the second, muscle meat and milk have been shown to be incapable
of carrying the infective agent, and measures have been taken, and
strengthened, to exclude from the food chain certain parts of the
animal, including all those parts shown to be capable of carrying the
infective agent. These measures require the most stringent
enforcement and heavy penalties for evasion.
Having regard to the present scientific evidence, therefore, and
provided that the above measures are fully implemented, muscle meat of
British beef would appear to be without risk of causing CJD.
As regards animal health, successful measures have been taken, and
strengthened, to reduce the incidence of BSE in cows and these are
expected to lead to the virtual elimination of the disease.
On the basis of present scientific knowledge, no further measures are
needed. If additional measures are taken, it will be for other than
scientific reasons.
While that sums up the present state of knowledge, scientists always
have to keep open minds. They have to act on existing knowledge while
recognising that further research will bring new information and
knowledge, which may in turn lead to revised conclusions. We welcome
the undertaking to devote substantial extra resources to research in
this field.

Background
Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is a fatal brain disease of
cattle which has only come to light in recent years, having been first
recognised in the UK in 1986. The disease is caused by an
unconventional infectious agent, originally described as a 'slow
virus', a 'self-replicating protein' and more recently as a 'prion'
(PrPsc) an aberrant conformation of normal protein (PrPc). Research is
increasingly supporting Prusiner's hypothesis, whereby a prion
molecule contacts a normal PrPc molecule in the membrane protein of
the brain, and induces it to refold into the aberrant conformation,
and molecules so formed go on to do the same to other normal PrPc
molecules, thus creating further replicas from normal protein.
Scrapie in sheep, BSE in cattle and CJD, a rare brain disease in
humans, are all neurodegenerative disorders thought to be transmitted
by such proteinaceous infective agents. These infective agents have
many similar common characteristics.
The incubation period in cattle is very long, commonly 3-5 years (but
the range can be considerably wider), and there were fears that meat
and milk from cattle which were infected with the agent (but not yet
showing clinical signs of the disease) could enter the human food
supply chain and transmit the disease to man. Such fears have been
repeatedly exacerbated by alarmist publicity in the media, by news of
bans on UK beef applied from overseas and by a dearth of easily
assimilated and verified information. The most recent developments
have been wrongly assumed to implicate beef muscle meat.
Independent and UK Government experts considering the problem from
1988 up to the present have judged that the chance of man becoming
infected in some way through meat or milk from BSE infected cattle
were extremely remote, this view being endorsed by the House of
Commons Agriculture Committee in their 1990 report and by the
Southwood Committee set up in 1988 specifically to consider the BSE
problem. Other experts and perceived experts were not so convinced
and expressed varying degrees of concern.
Even with the latest developments, the Spongiform Encephalopathy
Advisory Committee of independent experts (SEAC), which advises the
Government, and which made recommendations to strengthen the
precautionary measures, concluded that "If the recommendations are
carried out the Committee considers that the risk from eating beef is
now likely to be extremely small" including for children, hospital
patients, pregnant women and people taking immuno-suppressive drugs.
