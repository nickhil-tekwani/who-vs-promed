The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 14 Dec 2018:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 529, with 481 confirmed and 48 probable cases. In total, there have been 311 deaths (263 confirmed and 48 probable) and 183 people recovered.
- 96 suspected cases are under investigation.
- 8 new confirmed cases, including 4 in Mabalako, 2 in Katwa, 1 in Kalunguta, and 1 in Komanda.
- 5 new confirmed case deaths, including 2 in Mabalako, 1 in Komanda, 1 in Katwa, and 1 in Beni. All are community deaths, except that in Beni.
- 1 new person recovered and discharged from the Ebola treatment center (ETC) of Beni.

News of the response
--------------------
- Bishop Sikuli Paluku, the bishop of the Butembo-Beni diocese, launched the "Family Without Ebola" campaign throughout the district of Butembo-Beni. This project is part of the "Ebola Pas Chez Moi" citizen campaign launched by Beni students last October [2018].
- In a statement issued Fri 14 Dec 2018, the bishop calls all Catholic faithful to protect themselves to protect their neighbors and their community. He particularly emphasized the importance of youth engagement in the Ebola response. Inspired by the passage in the 1st letter of St. Paul the Apostle to Timothy, chapter 4, verse 12, he reminded the youth that they are not only the future of the country. They are also the present. The bright future of the DRC will not happen without them.
- Bishop Sikuli Paluku also invited all the priests and other religious leaders to increase awareness during liturgical and paraliturgical celebrations. He regretted that, despite the efforts of the response teams, the epidemiological situation remained alarming and the epidemic continued to spread because of members of the population who refused to apply the hygienic prescriptions. He strongly condemned "the inhuman and cruel mischief" of all those who verbally or physically attacked the response teams and the pastoral agents involved in the outreach. He also denounced those who desecrated the graves by digging up people who had died of Ebola and some of whom ended up being infected. The bishop also announced that any family who would lend themselves to such acts will be punished by a suspension of pastoral and liturgical services, including the Eucharistic celebration and other sacraments, so as not to put the other faithful in danger.
- Religious leaders in the affected areas have been involved in sensitizing the population since the beginning of the epidemic. Bishop Sikuli Paluku has personally engaged in sensitizing the population by agreeing to be vaccinated and regularly denouncing the hostile behavior that has caused the spread of the epidemic.

Vaccination
----------
- Continued wide-belt vaccination (or ring plus) in Otomaber (in Komanda Health Zone) and Aloya (in Mabalako Health Zone).

[2] Summary
- Fri 14 Dec 2018. Six more cases reported in DRC Ebola outbreak
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/12/six-more-cases-reported-drc-ebola-outbreak
[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

In a snapshot of the latest patterns in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC's) Ebola outbreak yesterday [13 Dec 2018], the World Health Organization (WHO) said conditions are "unforgiving," with community resistance and conflict hampering the response and poor infection prevention and control practices in certain health facilities amplifying disease spread. Today [14 Dec 2018] the DRC's health ministry reported 6 more cases, including 3 from 12 Dec [2018] in patients whose lab results were released late in the day.

The WHO said the infection control problems are occurring at several private and public health centers. The agency underscored the fact that Ebola virus spread in the clinic doesn't just affect patients; it's a threat to health workers as well. Over the past week, 4 new infections were reported in healthcare workers, raising the total to 51, including 17 deaths.

The pace of new infections has averaged about 33 a week since the middle of October [2018], and although there has been some decline in Beni -- the main hotspot -- the outbreak is intensifying in Butembo and Katwa, with new clusters popping up elsewhere. "At present, the situation remains concerning," the WHO said, noting that affected health zones reflect a mix of densely populated urban areas and remote villages, resulting in different transmission patterns and response challenges.

A high risk of further spread was exemplified this week when several contacts from Beni traveled to Kisangani and Goma, the provincial capital. The WHO said health officials quickly found the contacts, who returned to Beni to complete their 21-day follow-up. Also, several alerts for suspected cases came from Goma and locations between Goma and Butembo, and responders quickly isolated the patients, all of whom tested negative for the virus.

Despite the tough challenges and conditions, the WHO said progress has been made on several fronts, with new tools such as vaccination and experimental treatments in use alongside proven tactics such as surveillance and rapid isolation.

The 6 new cases push the overall outbreak total to 521 cases, 473 of them confirmed and 48 listed as probable. Of the newly infected patients, 3 are from Komanda, 2 from Beni, and 1 from Kalunguta.

Also, 2 more deaths were reported, 1 in Kalunguta and 1 in Komanda, and both occurred in the community, a factor that raises the risk of Ebola spread. The fatality count in the outbreak now stands at 306.

In vaccination developments, health officials began immunizing frontline providers in Goma health zone, where the recent alerts were issued, the health ministry said. Also, a new vaccination ring opened in the South Mabanga district of Karisimbi health zone, located in Goma, targeting people identified as contacts of a group from Beni who had been identified as contacts but traveled to Goma. So far, 46 047 people have been vaccinated since the campaign with Merck's experimental VSV-EBOV vaccine began on 8 Aug 2018.

- Fri 14 Dec 2018. Comment on Dashboard
[Crofs blog, edited]
https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/h5n1/2018/12/ebola-a-small-worrying-number.html

The Ministry of Health (MoH) and WHO AFRO run the informative Ebola DRC KIVU 2018 Dashboard, which is usually a day or 2 late but provides a good overview of the situation. One statistic, however, seems to stay about the same: the number of Ebola contacts who have not been traced.

All told, 6400 persons are considered contacts of Ebola cases, but only 5800 are being monitored. Thus, 600 remain unreached and perhaps unreachable.

Then the MoH reports "community deaths," which are likely the result of untraced contacts, and every one prolongs the fight against the outbreak. Worse yet, some infected contacts could cross the border or travel elsewhere in the DRC, and thereby spread the outbreak even further.

[3] Guinea: vaccine
- Fri 14 Dec 2018. Russia and Rusal complete Ebola vaccinations in Guinea
DJA Pharma [edited]
https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/rusal-ebola-vaccinations-in-guinea/

The Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation and domestic aluminum producer Rusal have completed vaccinations against Ebola virus in the Republic of Guinea. During the testing programme, as many as 2000 participants were administered with GamEvac-Combi vaccines. Health and development of immunity in these people will be monitored over one year.

Currently in the last testing phase, GamEvac-Combi has been created at the Gamalei Federal Research Centre for Epidemiology and Microbiology of the Russia's health ministry. The vaccine is developed using a biotechnology technique instead of the pathogenic Ebola virus. It is based on genetic material of an adenovirus and vesicular canker virus. This genetic material is considered safe for humans and contains a modified gene with information on GP protein structure of Ebola virus.

Data from the testing programme in Guinea are intended to support international certification of the vaccine, allowing its use by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and other entities to prevent the spread of Ebola. The vaccination was conducted at the Scientific Diagnostic Centre for Epidemiology and Microbiology (SDCEM), which was built by Rusal in 2015.

Minister of Health of the Russian Federation Veronika Skvortsova said: "Currently the vaccine is administered to the Russian medics and other specialists going to the regions where there is a high risk of Ebola contagion. During the Ebola outbreak, the centre has shown the best results in terms of the number of Guinean persons wholly recovered: 62.5% of the SDCEM patients with a confirmed Ebola fever diagnosis have been successfully treated."

In preclinical and clinical studies, the GamEvac-Combi vaccine is said to have demonstrated a favourable safety profile, along with ability to stimulate the immune system efficiently, compared with foreign vaccines.

[It is not clear whether this vaccine is effective once individuals are infected with Ebola, as stated in the report in a sidebar, "During the Ebola outbreak, the centre has shown the best results in terms of the number of Guinean persons wholly recovered: 62.5% of the SDCEM patients with a confirmed Ebola fever diagnosis have been successfully treated," or whether the vaccine is a preventative measure. It would be helpful to see the data on the original tests done prior to humans to determine efficacy pre- and post-infection. The report states the vaccine is based on genetic material of an adenovirus and vesicular canker virus. The latter is likely vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which is also a component of the Merck vaccine being used in the DRC. - Mod.LK
