Food Preservative Blamed for Illness
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YONKERS, N.Y. (AP) -- A food preservative was to blame for the sudden
outbreak of illness that triggered a chemical-contamination scare in
downtown Yonkers, a health official said.
``The food that the family digested was heavily contaminated with sodium
nitrite,'' said Mary Landrigan, spokeswoman for the Westchester County
Department of Health. ``In that quantity it can be deadly.''
Six victims were taken to St. Joseph's Medical Center Thursday night with
severe breathing problems, bluish pallors and mental confusion. Because the
cause was not immediately known, police, firefighters, hazardous-materials
workers and anti-terrorist agents were deployed.
One victim remained in critical condition Saturday; another was in critical
but stable condition, a hospital spokeswoman said. The other victims have
been released.
Health officials said the victims, identified only as adults of Egyptian
heritage, had been at a dinner party featuring a dish that included
processed food from Egypt.
Officials narrowed their hunt for a cause Saturday to a substance, in a
packet labeled in English and Arabic, that the victims said they had
sprinkled on their meal.
``A sample from a packet labeled 'refined iodized table salt' did not
contain table salt -- it was 100 percent sodium nitrite,'' Landrigan said.

[As mentioned in the prior ProMED-mail posting [Unknown illness, toxic
ingestion suspected - USA (NY) (02) 20020518.4251], accidental excessive
ingestion of sodium nitrite (saltpetre) has been responsible for prior
cases/outbreaks of methemoglobinemia following food ingestion (references
provided in prior posting). In this case it appears as though sodium
nitrite was in a container labeled 'refined iodized table salt' and the
product was used in the preparation of the food thinking it was salt. As
for whether the mislabeling of the container was accidental or deliberate,
that is out of the scope of this discussion and in the hands of the law
enforcement agencies, with a reminder that accidental mislabeling of
powdered substances that make their way into food preparation is
unfortunately not an uncommon event. Checking with local poison control
hotlines would confirm this observation. - Mod.MPP]
