Growers of winter [faba] beans are being warned that they must keep
well ahead of chocolate spot this season, with signs that the disease
is already present at high levels.

Anthony Biddle, PGRO [Processors and Growers Research Organisation]
confirms: "We are definitely seeing more signs of the disease in
winter beans than we have done for many years, and also at an earlier
growth stage. This is most likely due to the hard winter making the
crop more susceptible to disease. To protect yield potential it is
essential that a protectant spray is applied before the disease is
established."

Dr Biddle has been assessing the performance of a range of fungicides
against both chocolate spot (_Botrytis cinerea_ and _B. fabae_) and
rust (_Uromyces fabae_) in beans. He advises that the 1st application
should occur at early flowering stage, the 2nd 4 weeks later. "The
1st spray is usually targeted just at chocolate spot, the 2nd at both
chocolate spot and rusts."

According to Jonathan Ball, BASF Pulses, growers should be gearing up
to start their fungicide programme. "Chocolate spot can escalate to
epidemic proportions if it is warm and wet. If it stays warm, rusts
could become a problem later on in June [2010]," he says. "Chocolate
spot is not an easy disease to control and resistance issues need to
be considered, which is why it is useful to integrate fungicides with
different modes of action. With resistance management in mind,
fungicides from different cross-resistance groups should be alternated."

[Chocolate spot caused by the fungus _Botrytis fabae_ or the more
virulent _B. cinerea_ is an important disease of faba bean (_Vicia
faba_; also called broad bean, horse bean, Windsor bean, field bean,
winter bean) and other leguminous crops. For example, it is one of
the most destructive diseases of pulses in tropical African regions.
_B. fabae_ is prevalent throughout the season, while _B. cinerea_
affects crops intermittently and is usually confined to flowering time.

Symptoms start as brown spots on lower leaves, and this is considered
the 'non-aggressive' phase thought to have little effect on crop
yield. However, if warm, humid conditions persist for several days,
the disease will spread quickly and be termed 'aggressive' with
symptoms of leaf blight, defoliation, and loss of flowers and pods.
Stems can weaken and collapse, and flowers and pods may also develop
lesions although affected seeds are still edible. A plant toxin
produced by the pathogens is thought to be responsible for the damage
to the host tissue.

A strong relationship exists between disease incidence and seed
yield, with an average of 3 percent yield loss per percent of crop
infection for _B. c._ and 0.5 percent loss per percent of _B. f._
infection. Disease management includes cultural and phytosanitary
measures (such as burning of plant residue at the end of cropping,
wide spacing of plants, limiting the amounts of nitrogenous
fertilisers, crop rotation), use of clean seed, control of volunteer
plants, and fungicides. Host cultivars with varying levels of
tolerance are being developed.

It appears from the report above that bean rust is not present at
this time, but the fungicide treatments recommended for chocolate
spot will nevertheless serve as prevention for possible rust
development later in the season.
