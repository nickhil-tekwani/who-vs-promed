[Latterly there have been ovine outbreaks in Basilicata in 2009, 2011, and 2012; a mixed series in 2011 involving cattle, sheep, and horses; and 3 cattle affected in 2 outbreaks in 2014.

I hope that this dead sheep does not presage a widespread series as we have seen in the past in this region in 2004; see:
