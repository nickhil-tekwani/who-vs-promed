The deaths of more than 400 California sea lions in 1998 have
been traced to toxic algae that destroyed their brains.
The sea lions died along the California coast in the spring at the
same time an algal bloom was observed in Monterey Bay. The
algae carried domoic acid, a potent toxin that attacks the brain.
An examination of the animals showed the effects of domoic acid
in their brains, reported Christopher Scholin of the Monterey Bay
Aquarium Research Institute. Scholin said the sea lions had eaten
large quantities of anchovies, small fish that had fed on the algae.
The study marked a rare opportunity to track an outbreak of the
poisonous algae through the food chain.
"It's the first time it's been shown, and it's shown in a very sound
and convincing way,'' said Steven Bates of the Gulf Fisheries
Centre at Fisheries and Oceans Canada in Moncton, New
Brunswick.
About 70 sea lions survived the initial outbreak but showed
symptoms of domoic acid poisoning, including head waving,
depression and abnormal scratching. All but about 20 of those sea
lions eventually died.
The same kind of alga caused a die-off of cormorants in 1991 in
California. A related alga sickened people and killed marine life on
Prince Edward Island in Canada in 1987.

[This is an update on ref.(02) on sealions above, raising the
number of deaths to 400 & pin-pointing the movement of the toxin
up the food chain from anchovies. Other refs. above show how
domoic acid poisoning also affects seabirds & people who
consume shellfish - Mod.JW
