Newcastle disease highly suspected in France
--------------------------------------------
(date of previous outbreak of Newcastle disease in France reported to the
OIE: December 1999)
Translation of information received on (and dated) 19 Jul 2005 from Dr
Monique Eloit, deputy director general, General Directorate for Food
(DGAL), Ministry of Agriculture, Food, Fisheries and Rural Affairs, Paris:
An outbreak of Newcastle disease (NCD) is highly suspected in a farm at
St-Mars-de-Coutais, Loire-Atlantique department, Pays-de-la-Loire region
(in the western part of the country). The farm contains about 35 000
partridges and 20 000 pheasants.
On 19 Jul 2005, 20 pheasants showed positive serological results for
Newcastle disease, associated with mild clinical signs. Virological tests
are being carried out; their results should be available by 21 Jul 2005 at
the earliest.
Source of outbreak or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive (contact
with wild animals?).
Control measures
A. Undertaken: quarantine.
B. To be undertaken: preventive stamping out.
Other details/comments:
- The affected farm is located in 2 different sites.
- No birds have left the affected farm since 1 Jun 2005, with the exception
of one shipment to England on 22 June 2005.
- The affected farm is epidemiologically linked to the farm in Surrey,
United Kingdom which was declared infected with Newcastle disease on 15 Jul
2005.

[The cases in the French pheasants seem to have been mild or even
subclinical; the earlier identified NCD outbreak in pheasants in the UK
preceded and probably triggered the identification, followed by
notification, of the French outbreak. This incident clearly demonstrates
how critical effective vigilance, early notification, and international
cooperation are for the control of infectious animal diseases - Mod.AS]
