According to reports from the Strategy for Prevention of Vectorborne
Diseases of the Ayacucho Regional Health Directorate, a case of
sylvatic rabies has been registered in a woman in the 27th week of
pregnancy. The woman was a victim of a bat bite in the locality of
Sanabamba, San Miguel district in La Mar province. According to the
physicians, the patient is in good condition and to date has received
3 of the 5 intramuscular doses of [rabies] vaccine, scheduled over a
period of 14 days. In addition, 3 cases of sylvatic rabies in animals
have been registered in Vilcashuaman [capital of Vilcas Huaman
province] and one case in Sanabamba, San Miguel district.

The Ayacucho Regional Health Director, Antonio Sulca, said, "If one
suffers bat bites, it is important for the residents in high risk
areas to go to the nearest health posts to receive vaccine for
sylvatic rabies. Also, they must use bed nets when resting [or
sleeping]."

Given the alert for a possible outbreak of sylvatic rabies in Vilcas
Huaman and La Mar provinces, a multi-sectorial meeting decided to
promote public education, control, and prevention of sylvatic rabies
infections due to bat bites in the different areas in Ayacucho. There
was participation [in the meeting] by the Regional Agriculture office,
The Civil Defense Subdirectorate, the Ayacucho regional government,
SENASA [Servicio National de Sanidad Agraria; National Agricultural
Health Service], and the directorates of Environmental Health,
Epidemiology, and Health Promotion of the Regional Health
Directorate.

It was reported that DIRESA [Direccion Regional de Salud; Regional
Health Office] will intensify supervision, monitoring, information,
and public education actions. As well, it is necessary to define risk
areas to control the disease through use of bed nets, protective
measures for houses, training of health personnel, and provision of
rabies vaccine and rabies immune globulin to health posts.

The Civil Defense Subdirectorate of the Ayacucho regional government
must assure provision of bed nets. The Agriculture Directorate will
help with transport and personnel for monitoring and inspecting areas
of risk.

[The report is somewhat confusing in that the woman was reported as a
rabies case, when, in fact, she was probably exposed, is undergoing
post-exposure treatment (PET), and is doing well. She is scheduled to
receive 5 doses of rabies vaccine, although the current WHO
recommendation is 4 doses. One hopes that the PET is successful, and
that she does not become a clinical rabies case with its almost
certain fatal outcome.

The report indicates animal rabies cases in 2 provinces, but does not
specify which animals were involved. Sylvatic rabies in the American
tropics refers to vampire bat transmitted rabies virus. The
hematophagous bat most frequently involved is _Desmodus rotundus_. Its
preferred hosts are cattle and equine animals. Humans are not
frequently attacked, although it does occur occasionally. In a very
remote area in Peruvian Amazonas, several Awajun natives have died of
vampire bat transmitted rabies in February-March of this year (2011).
