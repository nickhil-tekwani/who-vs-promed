Collier County officials on Tuesday [29 Nov 2011] said they received
samples that indicated medium to high levels of red tide 10 to 20
miles [16-32 km] offshore last week [week of 21 Nov 2011].

Rhonda Watkins, a principle environmental specialist with the Collier
County Pollution Control and Prevention Department, said Florida Fish
and Wildlife Conservation Commission tests showed there were high
levels of red tide about 18 miles west of Naples Park and about 20
miles west of Keewaydin Island.

Researchers also found medium levels of red tide about 10 miles west
of Venetian Bay, about 15 miles west of the Naples Pier, and about 20
miles west of Doctor's Pass.

The samples were collected on 23 Nov 2011.

"A bloom happens every year and the extent of the negative effects
depends on where they hit shore," said Alina Corcoran, a research
scientist with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
"I wouldn't necessarily call it the worst red tide bloom or anything
... but it is a pretty significant event. It extends across 2 counties
in Southwest Florida."

It may not be the worst red tide the county has experienced, but
Watkins said it is the 1st significant bloom that's impacted Collier
County since June 2006.

The bloom may be offshore, but Watkins said beachgoers are starting to
feel the effect on shore. Watkins said there have been reports of "a
few dead fish scattered from Barefoot Beach to Lowdermilk Park" and on
Tigertail Beach on Marco Island, as well as respiratory irritation
from Barefoot Beach to Park Shore in Naples.

Watkins said signs are typically a tickle in the back of the throat,
watery eyes, and a runny nose. People with respiratory illnesses like
asthma and emphysema should avoid going to the beach because the
illness can be aggravated.

Katie Laakkonen, an environmental specialist for the city of Naples,
said she felt respiratory irritation as far south as the Naples Pier
when she was out on the beach Tuesday [29 Nov 2011]. "I heard quite a
few people coughing," she said.

The results of samples taken on Collier County beaches on 28 Nov 2011
were not immediately available Tuesday.

To report dead fish or red tide symptoms call the Collier County
Pollution Control and Prevention Department at 252-2502. Red tide
updates are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on the county's
red tide hotline at 252-2591.

[Red tide is caused by several toxic algae. Depending upon the toxin,
it is also known as paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), because it
causes shellfish to be toxic for consumption.

_Alexandrium_ spp is one of many members of this genus. Some members
may not be toxic. However, generally, the genus is found in coastal
waters high in nitrogen content. These organisms produce a neurotoxin,
like many of the organisms capable of causing paralytic shellfish
poisoning (PSP). The neurotoxin is considered fatal for humans
consuming contaminated shellfish and may be dangerous to humans and
animals who swim in waters that are 'blooming' with the organisms.
Ocean spray containing the organisms may also cause illnesses,
including rashes and eye irritation in people. Some species of this
genus are capable of causing 'red tide' that may be visible for long
distances along a coast line.

PSP is a significant problem in several geographic areas, especially
on both the east and west coasts of the US. Produced by several
closely related species in the genus _Alexandrium_, PSP toxins are
responsible for persistent problems due to their accumulation in
filter-feeding shellfish, but they also move through the food chain,
affecting zooplankton, fish larvae, adult fish, and even birds and
marine mammals.

_Alexandrium_ blooms generally do not involve large-cell accumulations
that discolor the water and may instead be invisible below the water
surface. Low-density populations can cause severe problems due to the
high potency of the toxins produced. Furthermore, _Alexandrium_ spp
can grow in relatively pristine waters, and it is difficult to argue
that anthropogenic nutrient inputs are stimulating the blooms. These
characteristics are important when considering mitigation and control
strategies.

Often PSP is associated with red tides or algal blooms. Red tide is
caused by an organism called _Karenia brevis_, which in high
concentration can make the water look red. The organism releases a
toxin that paralyzes the respiratory system of fish and other marine
life.

Airborne toxins, water spray, and splashes in an outbreak have kept
people from beaches while leaving others with irritated eyes and
throats. Red tide irritates the skin of people exposed to it and can
cause itchy eyes, scratchy throats, and coughs. Harvesting
[seafood]from affected areas for personal consumption is discouraged.
Red tide poisoning symptoms include nausea and dizziness and may last
for several days.

Previously the organism causing red tide was known as _Gymnodinium
breve_, but it has been reclassified in the taxonomy of
dinoflagellates. Its new name is _Karenia brevis_. Karenia was chosen
in honor of Dr Karen Steidinger, a prominent red tide scientist from
the Florida Marine Research Institute in St Petersburg, Florida
