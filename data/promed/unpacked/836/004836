Louisiana turtle farmers and lawmakers are trying to end a federal
ban on domestic pet turtle hatchling sales. "After 30 years of
research and development, we have developed a pet baby turtle that we
feel would be safe and very appropriate for the homes of children and
adults," said Keith Boudreaux, owner of Tangi Turtle Farm in Ponchatoula, LA.

Nine of the state's members of Congress introduced or co-sponsored
bills and amendments in 2007 that would have ended the Food and Drug
Administration's prohibition, which has stood since 1975. A turtle
farmers' organization is suing the FDA in federal court to contest
the fairness of the regulation, but no court date has been set. The
FDA adopted the regulation against selling pet turtles with carapaces
(shells) less than 4 inches long in response to links between the
animals and childhood salmonellosis infections in the late 1960s and
early 1970s. It allows the export of hatchlings and eggs and sales
for educational, scientific, and exhibition purposes.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports indicate
infections remain a concern. The CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly
Report from 25 Jan 2008 states that 24 people were hospitalized in a
series of salmonellosis cases related to exposure to small turtles in
2007 and early 2008. In support of the ban, the report cites a 1980
study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association
that the ban prevented 100 000 _Salmonella_ infections in USA
children each year.

"Prohibiting the sale and distribution of small turtles likely
remains the most effective public health action to prevent
turtle-associated salmonellosis," the report says.

Boudreaux said turtle farmers have improved feeding, pond health,
hatching, and storage practices since the 1970s. "I would be lying to
you if I told you that they were going to be 100 percent
_Salmonella_-free and they would stay 100 percent _Salmonella_-free,"
Boudreaux said. "They wouldn't, but our research and development and
the longevity of our treating procedure states that they are probably
98.9 percent _Salmonella_-free."

Small turtles are treated differently from other reptiles, which also
carry _Salmonella_, because they are most likely to be sold as
children's pets, according to information from the FDA. People who
illegally sell turtles can receive up to one year in prison and USD
1000 fines for each violation.

The 2008 CDC report [involving _S._ Paratyphi_ B var. Java - Mod.LL]
says 103 people reported illnesses attributed to salmonellosis in the
33-state outbreak from May 2007 to January 2008, and 47 of 80
patients said they were exposed to turtles within a week of their
illness. The report blamed the illegal sale of small turtles at pet
stores, flea markets, and other outlets.

Mark Sotir, PhD, an epidemiologist with the CDC, said a case-control
study conducted in investigating the outbreak found that people who
became ill were approximately 40 times as likely to have been exposed
to turtles before their illness than healthy people interviewed in
the study. Turtles are easily colonized with the bacteria and shed it
intermittently, often leaving no signs of infection, even through testing.

"We actually had a child last April 2008 die from salmonellosis after
being exposed to a small turtle," Dr. Sotir said. "What we do know is
children, immunocompromised persons, and the elderly are at higher
risk for invasive and more serious disease from _Salmonella_ infection."

Dr. Nicholas Saint-Erne, technical services veterinarian for PetSmart
Inc., said dropping the FDA restrictions would likely increase the
unregulated sale of cheap turtle hatchlings in small plastic boxes at
swap meets, convenience stores, and street corners. "I would love to
sell baby turtles in a pet shop," Dr. Saint-Erne said. "But I would
rather not sell them if they would put people's health at risk or the
whole pet industry's reputation at risk."

It was unlikely at press time that the Domestic Pet Turtle Market
Access Act of 2007 would pass and overturn the ban on the sale of
turtle hatchlings and eggs. The bill was referred to committees in
the Senate and House of Representatives in February 2007, and no
further actions were taken through September 2008.

The Philadelphia Department of Public Health is warning people of a
potential danger associated with keeping baby turtles as pets.

Health department officials report the number of cases of salmonella
poisoning linked to turtles has tripled in recent months, and the
majority of those getting sick are young children, including tiny infants.

To reduce one's risk of getting sick, the health department
recommends the following tips:

- Do not buy turtles with shells less than 4 inches long.
- Remove all reptiles from the house before bringing a new baby home.
- Do not clean the turtle's tank in the kitchen sink.
- Always wash hands after handling a turtle.
- Do not let turtles roam freely through the house.
- The health department said bleach is effective at disinfecting
areas where turtles have been.
- Salmonellosis is a bacterial illness; the disease is especially
dangerous to anyone with a compromised immune system.
- The health department wants people to dispose of turtles humanely.
The reptiles can be turned in to the Philadelphia Animal Care and
Control Association.
- Releasing pet turtles into the wild violates Pennsylvania Game
Commission regulations.

[From a medical and public health standpoint, this moderator sees no
reason to discontinue the current ban.

A photograph of the red-eared slider turtle, the small turtle
involved in this issue, is available at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-eared_slider>. - Mod.LL]

[And for a somewhat different view on the ban, ProMED-mail veterinary
moderator Mod.TG had the following thoughts: "If the turtles are
really free of salmonella -- they should be allowed. Why should
government have to protect us from pet turtles? Wash your hands if
you want to keep turtles. Teach kids cleanliness and responsibility."

Unfortunately in the human public health sector, we have observed
that recommendations aimed at disease prevention are not always
adhered to, but legislation is. - Mod.MPP]
