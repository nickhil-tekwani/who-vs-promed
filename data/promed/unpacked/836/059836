The deaths of a large amount of coral and deep-sea fish off the coast
of Green Island over the past month remains a mystery, members of a
special team in charge of the probe said yesterday [8 Jan 2008].
The special team was formed by the Eastern Coastal Patrol Office, the
Taitung County Government's fishery office, and the [Lu Tao] township
office, after residents on Green Island, better known locally as Lu
Tao, reported waves of dead fish being swept ashore daily, beginning
on 21 Dec 2007.
To date, no definitive cause for the massive die-off has been identified.
Seeking answers, the team will conduct further toxicity tests on
seawater taken from the beach where dead fish have been found,
research team members said.
It has been established that the deaths were not caused by illegal
fishing and that many of the fish had empty stomachs when they died.
The findings have added to the mystery following laboratory tests
that failed to find harmful bacteria in tissue samples taken from the
suddenly stricken fish.
Green Island, off the southeastern coast of Taiwan, has never
experienced such a massive fish die-off, Lu Tao Township chief Chen
Chia-wen said.
At first, island residents would pick up the fish, mostly from
valuable species such as groupers and parrot fish, and take them home
to eat, but stopped doing so after the dead fish continued to wash
ashore, Chen said.
