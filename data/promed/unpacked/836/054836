16 January 1998: Swine fever outbreak forces German pig cull
The slaughter of tens of thousands of pigs began Friday after an outbreak
of swine fever was detected at one of Germany's biggest piggeries. Farm
authorities in northeastern Germany said all the estimated 62,000 animals
at the farm near the town of Bad Kleinen in the state of
Mecklenberg-Vorpommern would have to be killed at a cost of around $5.5
million. As many as 15,000 pigs in Lower Saxony, 7,600 in North
Rhine-Westphalia and up to 3,500 in Schleswig-Holstein might also have to
be culled even though there was no sign yet that the disease had broken out
there, state authorities said.

(Spain), 16 Jan 1998

Xinhua News Agency has reported today from Bonn that the slaughter of about
77,000 pigs has been ordered by officials in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, North
Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony, and Schleswig-Holstein due to an outbreak
of classical swine fever in one farm and subsequent sale of breeding pigs
to other German states.
Belgium on Friday, 16 January imposed a temporary ban on the sale of pigs
from 90 farms that imported pigs from Germany during the past 40 days.
In Spain, according to a report received on 13 January by the Office
International des Epizooties, there were 2 new outbreaks of the disease in
December, 1997, one in Lerida province, the other in Segovia province. Out
of 17,558 susceptible animals, 98 died and 17,460 were destroyed.

[There is obviously more to this than these brief reports. Could those with
hard information provide us the insight as to how Germany & Spain got to
their severe situations. It does not happen overnight. - Mod.MHJ
