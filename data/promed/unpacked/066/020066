32 people working in a diamond mine in the central region of the Democratic
Republic of Congo are now known to have died from an "acute respiratory
syndrome" since the end of Jul 2005, according to new figures by the health
ministry.
"This infection, which must be confirmed by laboratory results, has already
seen 32 victims notified out of the 1500 cases registered," regional
medical inspector Dr Andre Kasogo Mulamba told AFP [Agence France Presse].
The epidemic broke out on 29 Jul 2005 at Kabongola, about 240 km from
Kindu, the main city of the central province of Maniema. On 11 Aug 2005,
the death toll stood at 23 out of 997 affected people in Kabongola, a
mining town of about 6000 inhabitants.
The [disease] begins with "bloody diarrhea" and is accompanied by fever,
pains in the throat, vomiting, and later difficulty in breathing.
An official with Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF, Doctors without Borders),
which last week sent an emergency team to Punia, north of Kindu, said it
could be a "pulmonary plague" but that this was unconfirmed.
A diagnosis may be [available] within a month, said MSF's Philippe Havet.

[This post again mentions bloody diarrhea as an initial manifestation of an
illness that seems to progress to respiratory failure. More clinical
information is needed, but one would think that pneumonic plague is
unlikely, not only because of the bloody diarrhea but also because of the
low case-fatality rate. Perhaps the respiratory failure is the result of
an adult respiratory distress syndrome related to shigellosis sepsis or
from renal failure related to hemolytic uremic syndrome from _E. coli_
O157. Alternatively, several illnesses may be appearing simultaneously.
ProMED thanks Mr. Greenway for this contribution. - Mod.LL]
