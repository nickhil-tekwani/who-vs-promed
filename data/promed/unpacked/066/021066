A severe outbreak of trachoma has been reported in Karamoja [sub-region] with at least 50 000 people in dire need of urgent eye surgery to prevent blindness.

The disclosure was made by the State Minister of Primary Health Care Sarah Opendi in Moroto town. She was officially launching the Karamoja and Busoga sub-regions trachoma elimination programme. "At least one out of every 6 people in Karamoja has trachoma," she noted. Opendi added that that this makes Karamoja the 2nd most trachoma endemic sub-region in the world after the Upper Nile state of South Sudan.

The Minister attributed the outbreak to the lack of toilet facilities in the sub-region adding that [only] a small percentage had facilities for refusal disposal. "Low latrine coverage leads to indiscriminate disposal of human excreta which promotes the breeding of flies," Opendi observed. [Flies are attracted to eyes, spreading the disease. - Mod.JW].

She also said crowded conditions in the family unit increase exposure to infection through close contacts. Others include sharing of clothes, bedding, handkerchiefs and towels.

[The following is extracted from moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post Conjunctivitis, trachoma - Sudan: (Jonglei) 20080928.3069:

"Trachoma is a chronic keratoconjunctivitis caused by recurrent infections with ocular serotypes of _Chlamydia trachomatis_, an obligate intracellular bacterium. Infection often begins during infancy or childhood, and, if left untreated, the infection eventually causes the eyelid to turn inwards, which in turn causes the eyelashes to rub on the cornea, resulting in intense pain and scarring of the cornea. This ultimately leads to blindness by the time the person is an adult.

"Trachoma is widespread in the Middle East, North and Sub-Saharan Africa, parts of the Indian subcontinent, Southern Asia, and China, with pockets of trachoma in Latin America, Australia (among native Australians), and the Pacific Islands (http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/diseases/trachoma/en/). The regions involved are characterized by poverty, crowding, poor personal and family hygiene, lack of safe water, absence of latrines or toilets, flies, and lack of facial cleanliness.

"Trachoma is spread person-to-person among children and within families by frequent exchange of infected ocular discharge from one child's face to another, by direct contact with secretions of affected individuals, by contact with contaminated inanimate objects, such as towels and/or washcloths, and by flies.

"Surgery is done to correct advanced stages of the disease. Facial cleanliness is emphasized to reduce disease transmission. Improved access to water and proper disposal of human and animal waste are reported to decrease the number of trachoma infections in communities (http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/diseases/trachoma/en/).

Antibiotics are given to treat active infection, using one percent tetracycline eye ointment administered to both eyes twice daily for 6 weeks or azithromycin administered as one oral dose (20mg/kg body weight). Tetracycline eye ointment is cheap and is almost universally available, but compliance is often poor, whereas azithromycin is well tolerated but is relatively expensive, unless donated by Pfizer Inc. through the International Trachoma Initiative (Mariotti SP: New steps toward eliminating blinding trachoma. N Engl J Med. 2004 Nov 4; 351(19): 2004-7).

"WHO Guidelines recommend that a district should receive community-based, mass antibiotic treatment when the prevalence of active trachoma among one to 9-year-old children is greater than 10 percent, and treatment should be repeated annually for 3 years, after which, a repeat district survey is carried out. If the district prevalence in one to 9-year-old children is still 10 percent or greater, annual mass treatment should be continued. If the prevalence is less than 10 percent, surveys should be conducted to determine the prevalence at the community level. Then, in communities in which the prevalence is less than 5 percent, treatment can be stopped, and in communities in which the prevalence is 5 percent or greater, annual treatment should continue until it falls below 5 percent (http://www.who.int/blindness/publications/tcm%20who_pbd_get_06_1.pdf)."

The Karamoja sub-region is located in northeastern Uganda and is bordered by South Sudan to the northwest, where trachoma is highly endemic (ProMED-mail post Conjunctivitis, trachoma - Sudan: (Jonglei) 20080928.3069).
