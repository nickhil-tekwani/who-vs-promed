A new case of mad cow disease (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE) has
been discovered in France, the agriculture ministry said Thursday.
A milk cow, born in November 1993, and a herd of 129 were slaughtered on
Wednesday after the new case was detected in the Cantal region, central
France. It was the third case in France this year. Last year, 31 cases of
BSE were found in France.
Officials say new cases of BSE will continue to appear in France until
2001, 5 years after stringent prevention measures were taken against the
disease, which has an average incubation period of 5 years.
In February, France will begin testing cattle destined for human
consumption to determine how widespread the disease has become.
