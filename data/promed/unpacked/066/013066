Out of the 26 provinces in the DRC [Democratic Republic of the Congo], 22 are exposed to sleeping sickness [human African trypanosomiasis]. Hence the importance of intensifying awareness campaigns and mobilizing funding to improve access to screening and care tools for the most affected communities, say the health authorities.

These statistics were given on [30 Jan 2022], on the occasion of the commemoration of the World Day for neglected tropical diseases [30 Jan 2022], including human African trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness. This commemoration also coincides with the anniversary of National Sleeping Sickness Day. This year [2022], the focus is on raising awareness and access to care.

According to the WHO, 5.6 million people are at high risk of infection with this disease. And the DRC alone notifies nearly 85% of cases in Africa.

In 2021, the country recorded 387 cases. In view of these statistics, the elimination of sleeping sickness in the DRC remains a major challenge. But it is true that in recent years, progress has led to therapeutic advances, in particular, the administration since January 2020 of fexinidazole, a new effective oral treatment, acting at all stages of the disease.

Human African trypanosomiasis also called sleeping sickness, is one of the most neglected tropical diseases in the world. It is transmitted by a vector, the tsetse fly, and is generally fatal if left untreated
