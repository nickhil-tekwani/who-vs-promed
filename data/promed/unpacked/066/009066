Some 42 students of the government school in the Viswanagar area of Nandyal town in Kurnool district fell sick after having their mid-day meal at the school premises on [Fri 11 Mar 2022]. The food was contaminated with spoiled eggs used in the cooking, which caused food poisoning. Soon after the students started vomiting in the school, they were taken to the government hospital at Nandyal town.

Some 92 children were studying at the government school in Viswanagar locality of Nandyal municipality. The students were served the mid-day meal consisting of rice, asparagus, boiled egg, and chickpeas as part of the Friday menu fixed by the state government. Soon after having their lunch, the students went to their classrooms. Many of them soon complained of stomach pain and started vomiting.

About 50 students with the sensation of vomiting were shifted to the hospital and a team of doctors treated them. Nandyal hospital superintendent Dr. Vijayakumar said contamination of food was the cause. "All are being provided necessary medical aid. The students are safe," he said.

Kurnool DEO Ranga Reddy went to Nandyala hospital and talked to the students and teachers about the incident. The DEO, after a preliminary inquiry, noted that spoiled eggs were served on the students. Action would be taken against the errant persons, he said.

[The illness here may well have been caused by staphylococcal enterotoxin. Classical food poisoning due to _Staphylococcus aureus_ presents with a short incubation period of 4-6 hours as acute nausea and vomiting usually without fever or diarrhea. The illness generally lasts less than 24 hours.

The following information regarding this entity is extracted from the Food-info site / _Staphylococcus aureus_ at http://www.food-info.net/uk/bact/staur.htm:

"In the diagnosis of staphylococcal foodborne illness, proper interviews with the victims and gathering and analyzing epidemiological data are essential. Incriminated foods should be collected and examined for staphylococci. The presence of relatively large numbers of enterotoxigenic staphylococci is good circumstantial evidence that the food contains toxin. The most conclusive test is the linking of an illness with a specific food or in cases where multiple vehicles exist, the detection of the toxin in the food sample(s).

"In cases where the food may have been treated to kill the staphylococci, as in pasteurization or heating, direct microscopic observation of the food may be an aid in the diagnosis. A number of serological methods for determining the enterotoxigenicity of _S. aureus_ isolated from foods, as well as methods for the separation and detection of toxins in foods, have been developed and used successfully to aid in the diagnosis of the illness. Phage typing may also be useful when viable staphylococci can be isolated from the incriminated food, from victims, and from suspected carriers such as food handlers."

"A toxin dose of less than 1.0 microgram in contaminated food will produce symptoms of staphylococcal intoxication. This toxin level is reached when _S. aureus_ populations exceed 100 000 per gram."

"Foods that are frequently incriminated in staphylococcal food poisoning include meat and meat products; poultry and egg products; salads such as egg, tuna, chicken, potato, and macaroni; bakery products such as cream-filled pastries, cream pies, and chocolate eclairs; sandwich fillings; and milk and dairy products. Foods that require considerable handling during preparation, and that are kept at slightly elevated temperatures after preparation, are frequently involved in staphylococcal food poisoning." - Mod.LL
