Health authorities in south China's Guangdong province have identified
the virus that led to the death of a local bus driver, although the
source of the virus remains unclear, a local disease control center
said Monday [2 Jan 2012]. The highly pathogenic avian A/(H5N1)
influenza virus is carried by poultry and birds, according to a
statement released by the Shenzhen Disease Control Center.

Genetic analysis of the virus has indicated that it is similar to a
virus found in dead migrant birds in a 2011 avian influenza outbreak
in Hong Kong. However, it is not known if the case in Guangdong is
related to migrant birds, the center said.

A 39-year-old man from the Bao'an district of Shenzhen was
hospitalized for a fever on 21 Dec 2011 and tested positive for the
H5N1 avian influenza virus. He died of multiple organ failure Saturday
afternoon [31 Dec 2011].

Poultry and migrant birds are the only vectors for human H5N1
infection, according to He Jianfeng, director of the Epidemics Studies
Institute of the Guangdong Disease Control Center. However, he said
that there is no clear evidence that the bus driver had close contact
with poultry or migrant birds. Health authorities are still working to
figure out where and when he acquired the virus. Although it is highly
pathogenic, the virus cannot be spread from person-to-person, the
center said in a previous statement, adding that there is no need for
people to panic.

The Guangdong Department of Agriculture also announced on Saturday
that no epidemics of avian flu among poultry have been reported in the
province.

[The origin of the bus driver's infection remains unknown, other than
that the infecting virus is closely related to a virus isolated from
migrant birds in Hong Kong in 2011. A ProMED-mail correspondent has
commented that this information probably implies that the virus
isolated from the victim retains an avian-type alpha 2-3 sialic acid
receptor site. - Mod.CP]
