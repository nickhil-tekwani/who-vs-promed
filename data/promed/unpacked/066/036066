European clubroot differential (ECD) 04 is a key source of clubroot resistance for canola breeding programs around the world, said scientist Rudolph Fredua-Agyeman. [It] has been bred into most clubroot-resistant varieties, including Mendel -- a European winter cultivar that has also been used for Canadian varieties.

But in 2013, clubroot strains started to overcome the resistance [ProMED-mail post 20150618.3447106]. Most notable of these strains is 5x, which can cause disease severity of up to 90 per cent. At least 9 other strains have also been identified.

"We went from ECD 04 -- complete resistance -- to Mendel [with] resistance to only 50 per cent of the new strains, and then to the commercial varieties, none of which are resistant to these new strains," he said. "Not all the resistance genes were passed on from ECD 04 to Mendel, and from Mendel to the commercial varieties."

Growers will need to take a more "integrated" approach to clubroot management, said Stephen Strelkov, University of Alberta. Reliance on resistant varieties has caused resistance to break down in record time. It only takes about 2 crops of a resistant variety for the pathogen to start to shift, and if those crops are back to back, it takes less than 3 years for resistance to break down. "Our crop is still at risk from clubroot. The pathogen is changing and evolving," said Strelkov.

[Clubroot of _Brassicaceae_ is caused by the fungus-like organism _Plasmodiophora brassicae_. It is a destructive soil-borne disease affecting nearly all cultivated members of the family, including oilseed rape (_Brassica napus_; "canola" refers to a group of specific varieties), cabbages and turnips, as well as many wild species which may serve as pathogen reservoirs. It is found worldwide and is most damaging in temperate regions and tropical highlands.

The pathogen enters root hairs and wounded roots. It multiplies rapidly causing abnormal enlargement of the underground stem, taproot, or secondary roots ("clubs"). Affected roots often decay before the crop has matured. Depending on the timing of infection in the crop cycle, symptoms may include wilting, stunting and yellowing of plants, or premature ripening resulting in shrivelled seeds. Due to the distortion of the roots, plants may wilt in dry weather and then recover at night.

Decaying roots release many resting spores, which can survive in the soil for a decade or more in the absence of a susceptible host plant. The disease can be spread with soil (for example on agricultural machinery), farming activities and infected plant debris. Use of clean planting material and phytosanitary measures to prevent spread between fields is essential. Disease management is difficult due to the longevity of the spores and the inaccessibility of underground plant parts to fungicides. Raising soil pH by addition of lime and experimental fumigation treatments have been shown to be effective (see ProMED-mail post 20120521.1139354).

The species is composed of numerous pathotypes, which makes breeding crop cultivars with durable resistance difficult. In Canada, several of the pathotypes are known to occur. The report above illustrates the importance of using multiple approaches to disease management simultaneously, to counteract pathogen adaptation and extend the useful duration of both host resistances and effectiveness of fungicides.
