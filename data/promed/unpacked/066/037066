Russia's Rosselkhoznadzor agricultural watchdog has reported new outbreaks of African swine fever (ASF) in the Pskov and Tambov regions.

Officials said the regional veterinary laboratory had found genetic material of the ASF virus in samples taken from a young pig from a private household in the settlement of Tserkovishche, Pskov region, housing 89 animals.

The virus was also confirmed after probes had been taken from a dead pig in a private household in the settlement of Karlovka, Tambov region, where 116 pigs were kept, the watchdog said.

There is no vaccine against ASF, which can be stopped from spreading only through culling infected animals.

[A summary of all 101 ASF reports from Russia since the start of the current epizootic in September 2009, covering the 261 recorded outbreaks, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000013742_20130709_125635.pdf.

Follow-up reports Nos. 97, 98 and 99 were submitted, respectively, on 11 Jun, 18 Jun and 21 Jun 2013. The most recent follow-up report, No. 100, was submitted by Russia on 9 Jul 2013, addressing a wild boar in the Yaroslavskaya oblast. Has Russia decided to apply a slowed down reporting frequency? The epizootic is officially considered as "continuing".

For details on new outbreaks reported since 9 Jul 2013, please refer to the 5 postings below.

The Tambov oblast is situated about 480 km (300 miles) south-southeast of Moscow; map at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Map_of_Russia_-_Tambov_Oblast_(2008-03).svg. As far as can be seen in OIE's maps, no earlier ASF outbreaks seem to have been reported earlier from this oblast. - Mod.AS
