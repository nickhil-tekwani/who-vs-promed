News
----
The DRC is home to the 1st training workshop on laboratory diagnosis of ebolavirus disease.
- The training center of the new building of the National Biomedical Research Institute (INRB) houses since 17 Feb 2020 the 1st workshop training on laboratory diagnosis of ebolavirus disease.
- The announcement was made this Thursday [20 Feb 2020] by the Technical Secretary of the Multisectoral Committee of the response to the epidemic of ebolavirus disease (CMRE), Professor Jean-Jacques Muyembe Ntanfum, during the official inauguration ceremony of the new modern INRB building by Prime Minister Sylvestre Ilunga Ilunkamba.
- "This center is expected to become a center of excellence for Ebola in the DRC, which has known for more than a year its 10th epidemic of ebolavirus disease," said Professor Jean-Jacques Muyembe, as director of INRB.
- 26 participants from 10 countries, friends of the DRC, took part in the workshop, including faculty composed of experts from Senegal, France, Burundi, the USA and DRC.
- The director of the INRB reported that this training center has 2 practical training rooms for training INRB teams of Congolese researchers as well as those from other countries in the subregion.
- For the Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Ambassador of Japan in the DRC, Karube Hiroshi, the INRB rehabilitation project, the largest laboratory in the country, is the realization of the exchange of notes signed in May 2017, for a total about USD 21 million, consisting of equipping the Institute with a new building for exams, research and training resources.
- Professor Jean-Jacques Muyembe has directed the National Institute of Biomedical Research since 1997; his stability at this position has allowed him to print a new vision within the structure of the Ministry of Health that led to this current development.

Vaccination
-----------
- 14 566 people were vaccinated, as of 18 Feb 2020, with the 2nd vaccine Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo (Johnson & Johnson) in the 2 health areas from Karisimbi to Goma.
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018 with the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, 296 584 people have been vaccinated.

Surveillance at entry points
----------------------------
Since the start of the epidemic, the cumulative number of travelers checked (temperature taken) at health checkpoints is 153 575 346.

[2] Summaries
- Thu 20 Feb 2020. Disease outbreak news: Update
[WHO, abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/20-february-2020-ebola-drc/en/

During the past week, the incidence of new ebolavirus disease (EVD) cases has remained low (see Figure 1 at the source URL). From 12-18 Feb 2020, one new confirmed case was reported. The case was reported in Beni Health Zone, North Kivu Province and had an epidemiological link to a confirmed case reported on 5 Feb 2020. As the case was alerted and transferred to an Ebola treatment centre 4 days after symptom onset, there remains a risk that onward transmission to contacts may have occurred, and further cases may be expected from the currently active chain of transmission. Ebola virus may also persist in some survivors' body fluids for several months, and in a limited number of instances, transmissions from exposure to body fluids of survivors have been documented during this outbreak. The ongoing programme for survivor care helps mitigate the risks of re-introduction events.

To maintain operations and prevent re-emergence of the outbreak, WHO is requesting funding. Under the Strategic Response Plan (SRP 4.1), WHO's financial need for the Ebola Response from January to June 2020 is USD 83 million. Thanks to the generosity of many donors during 2019, WHO has some carry-over funding, which has been applied to maintain operations through February 2020. USD 40 million is currently needed to ensure continuity of response and preparedness activities to bring the case incidence to zero, and continue building strong, resilient health systems.

In the past 21 days (29 Jan-18 Feb 2020), 8 confirmed cases were reported from 4 health areas within 2 active health zones in North Kivu Province (see Figure 2 and Table 1 at the source URL): Beni (n = 7) and Mabalako (n = 1). It has been more than 42 days since Butembo and Mambasa health zones reported new cases. The continued reduction of geographic spread of EVD cases and the declining trend in case incidence observed in the past 21 days are encouraging.

As of 18 Feb 2020, a total of 3433 EVD cases were reported, including 3310 confirmed and 123 probable cases, of which 2253 cases died (overall case fatality ratio, 66%) (Table 1). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n = 1924) were female, 28% (n = 969) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n = 172) of all reported cases were healthcare workers. Substantial case finding activities continue with more than 5000 alerts reported and investigated daily, among which approximately 450 suspected EVD cases are detected each day who require laboratory testing and specialized care within the established Ebola treatment and transit centres.

Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning. Non-active health zones indicate health zones that have not reported cases in the last 42 days.
