Chief medical officer of the Sankuru Provincial Health Division, Aimée Alengo reported the following statistics to local media:

"From the 1st week to the 34th epidemiological week, the province notified that 1258 cases of Monkeypox including 23 deaths were recorded. The epicenter of this disease are the health zones crossed by the equatorial forest, namely: Bena Dibele, Tumbiloto, Lombela, Katako, Lodja and Bikuku. In these areas, the vital activity is fishing and hunting, the reservoir of this disease is the corpses of monkeys found in the forest and consumed by the population".

In addition, Aimée Alengo indicates that at the current stage there is no support from the government or from partners in the management of cases of this disease in the region.

"In the past we had a whole program supported by USAID where they were also taking charge of the cases. Now we take care of the cases with the means on board, for the moment we have neither the intervention of the government nor of the partners", he lamented.

The Democratic Republic of Congo is facing a worrying development of the monkey pox epidemic. It was the 1st country to have discovered a human case of this disease in 1970. The country intends to strengthen surveillance of this viral zoonosis to control it or even significantly reduce the number of cases.

According to the World Health Organization, From 1 Jan to 14 Aug 2022, the Democratic Republic of the Congo reported 2877 suspected including 195 confirmed cases from 134 health zones across 22 provinces, with Sankuru being the most affected province.

[2] USA (Los Angeles): death

Key Points
• Dr. Rita Singhal, director of disease control for Los Angeles County, said health officials are investigating what role monkeypox may have played in the person's death.
• Health officials in Texas are investigating the death of an adult who had monkeypox.
• The individual in Texas had a severely compromised immune system, officials said.

Los Angeles health officials are investigating the death of a person who had monkeypox.

Dr. Rita Singhal, director of disease control in Los Angeles County, said it's not clear what role monkeypox may have played in the person's death. Officials do not have additional details at this time, Singhal said.

"This is one of 2 deaths in the United States that are currently under investigation to determine whether monkeypox was a contributing cause of death," Singhal told reporters during a press conference Thursday [8 Sep 2022].

Health officials in Texas last month [August 2022] reported the death of an adult in the Houston area who was diagnosed with monkeypox. The individual had a severely compromised immune system, according to health officials.

Monkeypox is rarely fatal, but people with weak immune systems are at higher risk of severe disease. The virus causes a painful rash that resembles blisters or pimples.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in a report published Thursday [8 Sep 2022], found that 38% of 2000 patients diagnosed with monkeypox from May to July [2022] were HIV positive. People who have monkeypox and HIV were hospitalized more often than those who did not have HIV, according to the study.

The U.S. is trying to contain the largest monkeypox outbreak in the world, with more than 21 000 cases across all 50 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, according to the CDC.

Worldwide, 9 monkeypox deaths have been confirmed since the outbreak began, according to CDC data. Deaths have occurred in Belgium, Brazil, Cuba, the Central African Republic, Ecuador, Ghana, India, Nigeria and Spain.

More than 56 000 monkeypox cases have been reported across 96 countries since the outbreak began, according to CDC data.

Monkeypox is primarily found to be spreading during sex among gay and bisexual men, though anyone can get monkeypox through close contact with someone who is infected or via contaminated materials like towels and bedsheets.

Federal health officials said this week that the outbreak appears to be slowing as vaccines, testing and treatments have become more widely available. Demetre Daskalakis, deputy head of the White House monkeypox response team, said it took 25 days for cases to double in August [2022] compared to 8 days in July [2022].

The U.S. has administered more than 460 000 monkeypox vaccine doses to date. About 1.6 million gay and bisexual men who have HIV or who are taking medication to reduce their risk of contracting HIV face the highest risk from monkeypox, according to CDC.

The monkeypox vaccine, Jynneos, is administered in 2 doses 28 days apart. CDC officials say it's crucial for people at risk to receive the 2nd shot. It takes 2 weeks after the 2nd dose for the immune system to reach its peak response.

[3] Monkeypox as an STI
Date: Fri 9 Sep 2022

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/09/commentary-no-question-monkeypox-sti


Commentary: No question monkeypox is an STI
-------------------------------------------
Whether or not monkeypox (MPX) should be labeled a sexually transmitted infection (STI) isn't much of a debate among STI experts.

So far, more than 95% of cases in the United States have been acquired during sexual contact among men who have sex with men (MSM). To not call it an STI is nearly equivalent to saying syphilis isn't an STI because exceptions to sexual transmission are common in some settings.

Pragmatically, MSM should be advised that certain sexual practices and lifestyles put them at very high risk of MPX. As well as its opposite: That modified sexual exposures can be nearly 100% protective.

Today [9 Sep 2022], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a report documenting an intimate association between MPX and other STIs in MSM in the United States. The CDC has long advised screening patients who have newly diagnosed STIs for other STIs, and it recommends STI screening all persons evaluated for MPX, implicitly recognizing MPX as an STI.

Recently reported cases of MPX in persons other than MSM is similar to the course of HIV transmission in the early years of HIV/AIDS in industrialized countries. But the dominant sexual transmission of HIV among MSM, and its characterization as an STI in them, remains valid.

Precedents with other infections
--------------------------------
That an infection is an STI in some settings but not others has precedents. Among MSM, most enteric infections (e.g., Salmonella, Campylobacter, hepatitis A) are properly considered STIs, even though sexual transmission is uncommon in the population as a whole.

Chancroid, one of the 5 classical venereal diseases, is now known to be a common non-sexually transmitted skin infection in tropical climates, best documented in Papua New Guinea and other South Pacific islands. That doesn't imply that chancroid should not be considered an STI in most populations and geographic areas.

A valid approach is to ask what the epidemiology of a condition would be if sex were not involved. Some cases of tuberculosis, influenza, Zika, and Ebola are transmitted between sex partners and undoubtedly during sexual contact. But if sex didn't exist, there would be little if any change in overall incidence or prevalence, and we don't label them as STIs.

The exact opposite is true of syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia -- generally sexually transmitted but with well-documented exceptions. For MPX and enteric infections in MSM, eliminating sexual contact would markedly reduce -- and perhaps eliminate -- transmission in that population.

Accuracy while limiting stigma
------------------------------
Part of the problem, of course, is that characterizing an infection as sexually transmitted automatically makes it stigmatizing. It's a social issue without easy or quick resolution, stemming from the problems most societies have with sex and sexuality in general.

Avoiding the truth doesn't help, but of course context, tact, and understanding are requirements in limiting stigmatizing interpretations. For example, in some circumstances it may be useful to characterize an infection as sexually transmissible rather than sexually transmitted, with the former term implying flexibility, including nonsexual transmission mechanisms.

[4] Reduced volume vaccine
Date: Thu 8 Sep 2022
Source: Reuters [edited]
https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-starts-enrollments-trial-testing-smaller-dosage-monkeypox-vaccine-2022-09-08/


The National Institutes of Health said on Thursday [8 Sep 2022] it had started enrollments in a trial testing an alternative method of administering Bavarian Nordic's monkeypox vaccine, Jynneos, which requires smaller dosages.

U.S. health regulators last month [August 2022] authorized injecting the shot intradermally in adults, meaning between layers of the skin rather than below the skin, in an effort to stretch out low vaccine supplies.

This alternative intradermal dosing regime will allow health care providers to administer up to 5 times the number of vaccine doses per vial of shot.

The NIH trial will enroll 200 people between 18 and 50 years of age, who have not been previously vaccinated, across 8 U.S. research sites.

Citation: O'Laughlin K, Tobolowsky FA, Elmor R, et al. Clinical Use of Tecovirimat (Tpoxx) for Treatment of Monkeypox Under an Investigational New Drug Protocol -- United States, May-August 2022. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. ePub: 9 September 2022.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
What is already known about this topic?
Tecovirimat (Tpoxx) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of smallpox based on data obtained from animal models; there are no safety or efficacy data regarding its use in patients with Monkeypox virus infection.

What is added by this report?
Among 549 patients with Monkeypox virus infection treated with tecovirimat under an Expanded Access Investigational New Drug protocol, 99.8% received it orally as an outpatient. Among 369 patients, few adverse events were reported.

What are the implications for public health practice?
Tecovirimat is generally well tolerated, and these data support continued access to treatment with tecovirimat during the current monkeypox outbreak.
