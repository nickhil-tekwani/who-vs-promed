A study by Benguet State University assessed the incidence and severity of diseases in the 6 provinces of Cordillera [region] that necessitate quarantine. The provinces are Abra, Apayao, Benguet, Ifugao, Kalinga, and Mountain Province. The Cordilleras is the foremost producer of major agricultural crops in the country. An estimated total of 33.5 ha [about 82.8 acres] was surveyed.

_Tomato mosaic virus_ is prevalent in Benguet while _Banana bunchy top virus_ had the highest occurrence at [locations in] Benguet, seconded by Apayao, Kalinga, and Ifugao. 80 per cent of 0.20 ha [about 0.5 acres] Chinese cabbage in Benguet [was] infected with _Turnip yellow mosaic virus_. In Mountain Province, of 0.25 ha [about 0.6 acres], 15 per cent incidence of _Potato aucuba mosaic virus_ in potatoes was found, whereas, 12 per cent of Benguet's coffee nurseries were infested with yellowing, little leaf and mosaic symptoms.

In Benguet, mushroom bacterial blotch caused by _Pseudomonas_ sp., bacterial wilt caused by _Ralstonia solanacearum_ race 1 on seed potatoes, and rose crown gall caused by _Agrobacterium_ sp. were the eminent bacterial diseases. The study documented several fungal diseases: yam anthracnose, chrysanthemum white rust, anthurium leaf spot, strawberry leaf spot and berry rot, coffee leaf spot, and fusarium wilt in banana. Potato late blight and taro leaf blight were also identified.

[Crop pathogens mentioned above are or are likely to be:
_Tomato mosaic virus_ (ToMV; genus _Tobamovirus_) is an economically important disease of glasshouse and field tomatoes. It can affect a wide range of solanaceous hosts and species in several other families, including many crops.

_Banana bunchy top virus_ (BBTV; genus _Babuvirus_) causes one of the most serious diseases of banana; transmitted by the banana aphid _Pentalonia nigronervosa_.

"Turnip Yellow Mosaic Virus" -- this may refer to either _Turnip mosaic virus_ (TuMV; genus _Potyvirus_) or
_Turnip yellows virus_ (TuYV; genus _Polerovirus_).

_Potato aucuba mosaic virus_ (genus _Potexvirus_) affects a range of solanaceous crops.

Yellowing, little leaf, and mosaic symptoms on coffee -- may be caused by phytoplasmas or viruses.

"Mushroom bacterial blotch by _Pseudomonas_ sp." -- bacterial blights, wilts and canker diseases due to different species or pathovars of _Pseudomonas_ can affect a range of crops.

"Bacterial wilt caused by _Ralstonia solanacearum_ race 1 on seed potatoes" -- brown rot (also called bacterial wilt) of potato is caused by _R. solanacearum_ race 3 (biovar 2, adapted to cooler temperatures) or race 1 (prevalent in warmer areas).

Yam anthracnose is one of the most serious diseases of the crop; caused by the fungus _Colletotrichum gloeosporioides_ (synonym _Glomerella cingulata_).

Strawberry leaf spot may be due to a number of fungi, bacteria and viruses.
Strawberry berry rot may be caused by a number of different fungi.

"Coffee leaf spot" -- this may refer to the fungus _Phyllosticta coffeicola_.

Fusarium wilt in banana or Panama disease is caused by the soil borne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _cubense_.

Potato late blight is caused by the fungus-like organism _Phytophora infestans_ which can devastate both potato and tomato crops.

Taro leaf blight is caused by _Phytophthora colocasiae_.
