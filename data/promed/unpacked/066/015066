A cow which was affected by rabies and terrorizing people in and around Valpoi was caught by members of Shriram Gosanvardhan Kendra Nanuz on [Mon 13 Jul 2015] and is being kept in the cattle shed of Valpoi municipality under observation.

The cow was attacked and bitten by a rabies-affected dog. Since the disease was transmitted to the cow, it was attacking people. Stray cattle have been a big nuisance for the residents of Valpoi municipality.

On account of the aggressive behaviour of the cow, Valpoi locals and those residing in the surrounding areas on Monday [13 Jul 2015] complained to the police. Valpoi police, firemen and workers of the municipality tried to catch the animal but were unsuccessful. Finally, members of Shriram Gosanvardhan Kendra Nanuz Laxman and Sameer Joshi were contacted and were successful in catching the cow.

Shrish Betkikar, a veterinary doctor in Valpoi, when contacted by [The Times of India] TOI, said, "The cow has been affected by rabies. It is very risky to release this cow and allow it to mix with other cattle. Presently, we have kept it under observation in the cattle shed of the municipality. As the disease is in the final stages, the cow will die within 2 to 3 days and hence it has been kept in isolation."

On previous occasions, the cow attacked a few persons in the vicinity of Valpoi, and people were scared of the animal. Stray cattle and stray dogs have become a serious problem in many villages of Sattari taluka [administrative district]. People have urged the government to take the necessary steps to curb the spread of rabies.

[Cattle and horses are the most frequently reported livestock species affected by rabies.

The newswire above is unclear on the extent of the cow's attacks on people and whether any people were injured. It also provides no detailed information on the diagnosis of the rabid cow.

The rabid cow was at the furious stage with signs of aggression. In the furious form of rabies in cattle, normally docile animals may attack humans and other animals. Milk production ceases abruptly in dairy cattle. The cow may appear hypersensitive and will follow sounds and movements intensely. The affected cattle may exhibit abnormal bellowing which may continue intermittently, or voiceless attempts to bellow described as yawning.

Rabies virus usually is transmitted from animal to animal through bites. The incubation period is highly variable. In domestic animals, the incubation period is generally 3-12 weeks but can range from several days to months, rarely exceeding 6 months depend upon the site of exposure.

Stray dogs are a common sight in India; the problem of waste disposal is recognized as a risk factor, increasing the abundance of stray dogs and thus the number of rabies cases in the region.

According to figures compiled by the Animal Welfare Board of India, Goa's shelters brought in a combined 16 254 stray dogs in 2012. More than 1/3 of these were sterilized and vaccinated under the Animal Birth Control programme. http://www.goastreets.com/to-catch-a-stray

International Animal Rescue, People for Animals and South Goa Animal Welfare Trust lead the fight against rabies in Goa by teaming up with Mission Rabies in 2014. The Mission Rabies sterilized and vaccinated 28 000 dogs, or 70 percent of the dog population in Goa. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/Mission-rabies-to-tackle-stray-dog-menace-in-Goa/articleshow/32380752.cms
