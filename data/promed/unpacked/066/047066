Two people that were taken to a Canberra hospital after eating
poisonous mushrooms on the weekend [31 Dec 2011-1 Jan 2012] remain in
a critical condition and are now en route to a Sydney facility for
treatment. A 3rd person who was with them was being treated at
Canberra Hospital.

The trio, who cannot be named, went to Calvary Hospital on New Year's
Day [1 Jan 2012] after becoming ill from eating death cap mushrooms, a
spokesman for ACT [Australian Capital Territory] Health said. 2 of the
3 were in a critical condition and were being transferred to a Sydney
facility.

The 3rd, whose condition has not been disclosed, was taken to Canberra
Hospital from Calvary Hospital.

A spokesman for Calvary Hospital said admissions involving mushroom
poisoning were rare.

ACT Health said death cap mushrooms are usually found in Canberra in
autumn, near oak trees, but recent summer rain has encouraged growth
of the mushrooms.

Fully-grown versions have silky smooth caps, and the colour varies
from white to greenish-brown.

"The gills are white -- unlike the pink or brown gills of the common
field mushroom," Michael Hall, director of Canberra Hospital's
emergency department said in a statement. He said people should not
eat any mushrooms unless they are sure they are not poisonous.

In the past decade, there have been 3 fatalities associated with death
cap mushrooms in the ACT. In the same period, there have been around a
dozen reported cases of poisoning.

Anyone who has eaten [or suspected they consumed - Mod.TG] death cap
mushrooms should seek urgent medical help, health officials said.

[The death cap mushroom is known worldwide to cause intoxication and
death. The death cap is _Amanita phalloides_.

The death cap mushroom (see picture at
http://www.fcps.edu/islandcreekes/ecology/Fungus/Death%20Cap/deathca2.jpg)
is generally mistaken for a non toxic variety. Alternatively it is
collected by someone not trained in the subtle differences of
mushrooms; someone believing it is a mushroom that has hallucinogenic
properties; someone applying some myth, such as it cannot be toxic
because it is growing on wood, or in the sun, or other such mushroom
nonsense.

Amanitas contain toxins known as amatoxins which are cyclopeptides.
This ring of amino acids inhibits production of some proteins,
especially in liver and kidney cells. Clinical signs generally begin
5-24 hours post ingestion. Signs and symptoms include nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. These initial symptoms may
resolve briefly, but without treatment there is severe liver and
kidney damage and even organ failure which results in coma and death.

In some cases clinical signs and symptoms may not begin for 1-2 days.
These signs mimic the flu or other gastrointestinal upset.
Consequently treatment is delayed and diagnosis can be difficult.

Early treatment may include fluids, antibiotics, and use of liver
supportive agents such as the extract of milk thistle which contains
the flavonoids sylimarin/silybin/silibinin. These flavonoids have been
demonstrated to inhibit amatoxin.

The milk thistle flavonoids success with amatoxin has not been able to
be duplicated with other toxins, such as aflatoxin that also affect
the liver, but are not related to mushroom toxins.
