Windsor, Ontario isn't alone in a spike of respiratory virus cases. Saskatchewan's chief medical health officer is advising parents to be aware of a respiratory virus that may be linked to dozens of cases of sick children in the U.S.

Windsor (Ontario) Regional Hospital CEO David Musyj told CBCWindsor that more than 10 children have been treated since Thursday [11 Sep 2014], so the hospital is restricting visitation in its pediatric ward. Only adults aged 18 or older are allowed access. Musyj said some children are being discharged, while others have been admitted. One child was sent to London, ON for further treatment. "It's not typical to see that many suffering from the same issues all at once," Musyj said.

"Effective immediately, as a result of a sudden increase in pediatric patients attending the emergency department and some being admitted for severe respiratory issues, we will be restricting visitors to the pediatric unit, Met campus, to 18 years of age and over. Only in extraordinary case by case circumstances will this restriction be waived. These visitor restrictions for the pediatric unit are being put into place to protect the health of pediatric visitors."

Musyj said staff are not sure whether enterovirus D-68 is to blame; the virus is currently affecting thousands of children in the United States. A blood test would be required to make that determination, Musyj said. He said he's waiting on the province to decide whether blood tests should be administered. The hospital will know whether the children had enterovirus D-68 "probably sometime this week, if it's determined by the province that they want to do blood tests," Musyj said. Later on Monday [15 Sep 2014], hospital spokesperson Ron Foster told CBC News that blood tests were underway.

Musyj said the virus begins with symptoms of the common cold, but they "increase rapidly. That's what the concern is with this virus." The most susceptible are children, usually those under 5, and sometimes adults. There is no treatment, only symptom management.

"To date, there has been no confirmation of enterovirus D-68 in Windsor and Essex County. Also, there has been no reported increase in school absenteeism due to respiratory illness," the health unit said in a media release on Monday [15 Sep 2014].

There are concerns in other parts of Canada as well: Saskatchewan's chief medical health officer is advising parents to be aware of a respiratory virus that may be linked to dozens of cases of sick children in the U.S. Alberta Health Services says it has seen a spike in "respiratory-related admissions" at the Alberta Children's Hospital since the end of August 2014.

[Most hospitals (in Canada and elsewhere) are not equipped for rapid diagnosis of uncommon strains of enteroviruses, hence the tentative nature of these reports. It is likely, nonetheless, that enterovirus D68 virus infection is equally as prevalent in Canada as it now apparently is in the United States. - Mod.CP
