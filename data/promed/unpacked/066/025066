Europe

Netherlands ex France
- National. 1 Oct 2020. We report autochthonous dengue virus (DENV) infection in 2 Dutch tourists who visited Departement Var, southern France, in July and August 2020. As some autochthonous dengue cases have occurred in Europe in recent years, awareness among physicians and public health experts about possible intermittent presence of DENV in southern Europe is important to minimise delay in diagnosis and treatment. Quick diagnosis can lead to timely action to contain the spread of vectorborne diseases and minimise transmission.

In order to avoid any risk of transmission, which is done through blood for dengue fever, the French blood establishment (EFS) no longer accepts blood donations from people living in Saint-Laurent-du-Var and Juan-les-Pins (06160) where having spent a night in these 2 towns.

In Italy, 10 locally acquired cases have been reported in the Veneto region since the summer. Officials say the probable origin of the primary travel-related case is West Sumatra, Indonesia. The DEN-1 serotype is the viral strain reported. _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes are endemic in the region. Cases in France: Herault (1), Alpes-Maritimes (5), and Var department (2).

Kenya
- National. 30 Oct 2020. Study uncovers "enormous burden of dengue" among Kenyan children. Specifically, out of more than 1000 children ill with fever, more than 40% were infected with dengue virus. Many children with dengue and without malaria were treated with antimalarial drugs, antimicrobial drugs or both, according to a report in Emerging Infectious Diseases. Dengue, which is endemic in more than 100 countries, "is an important cause of illness among children in Kenya, and clinicians should consider dengue as a cause of unlocalized fever," Melisa M Shah, an endowed postdoctoral fellow at Stanford Medicine, told Healio. Shah and colleagues tested blood samples from 1022 Kenyan children with ongoing febrile illness from 2014 to 2017. Of the 862 viable samples, dengue viremia was detected in 361 (41.9%). Of those 361 samples, 333 were classified as primary infections (92.2%), 14 were secondary infections (3.9%) and the remaining 14 samples lacked dengue virus immunoglobulin G data.

- St Lucia. 13 Oct 2020. The Ministry of Health and Wellness is currently investigating 2 dengue-related deaths. Both individuals were seen and managed at the Owen King European Union Hospital, where they presented with a clinical picture consistent with dengue fever. All samples were tested locally for dengue virus and have been sent to the Caribbean Public Health Agency for confirmation. To date [13 Oct 2020], Saint Lucia has recorded one confirmed dengue-related death and is investigating 2 new dengue-related deaths.

[2] Dengue viremia kinetics in asymptomatic and symptomatic infection
Date: Sat 26 Sep 2020

https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(20)32162-7/fulltext


Abstract
--------
Background: Dengue infection is a global health threat. While symptomatic cases contribute to morbidity and mortality, the majority of infected people are asymptomatic but serve as an important reservoir. However, the kinetics of viremia in asymptomatic infections remains unknown.

Methods: We enrolled 279 hospital-based symptomatic index cases and quantified dengue virus (DENV) RNA at enrollment and at the day of defervescence. To identify asymptomatic cases, 175 household members of index cases were monitored for clinical symptoms during follow-up, and blood was taken twice weekly to test for and quantify DENV RNA until cleared.

Results: We detected DENV in 13 asymptomatic household members (7.43%). Their DENV serotypes were primarily the same as those of their family index cases. The median peak DENV viremia in asymptomatic subjects was lower than that of symptomatic individuals during the febrile phase, and the viral decay rate was slower in asymptomatic infections.

Conclusions: DENV level and kinetics in asymptomatic individuals differed significantly from those of symptomatic cases. Despite the lower viremia, the slower decay rate in asymptomatic infections could lead to their prolonging the infectious reservoir. The improvement of transmission control to prevent such long-lived asymptomatic infections from transmitting the DENV is needed.
