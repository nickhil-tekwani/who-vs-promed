MOUSE BIRTH CONTROL - AUSTRALIA
===============================
Date: Mon, 28 Apr 1997 00:27:47 +0800
From: M. Wegner <rabbit@wantree.com.au>
[Paraphrased from the message received -- Mod CHC]
According to a local newspaper report, Australian scientists from CSIRO
[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization] have devised a
method of birth control for laboratory mice. They claim to have inserted a
protein involved in mouse reproduction into mousepox [ectromelia] virus.
When the mouse becomes infected with this virus, temporary infertility
results. More research is needed to ensure the virus does not affect species
other than mice.

[Mouse "plagues" occur periodically in Australia and do many millions of
dollars of damage to grain crops. This or any other method of rodent control
would be welcome economic news. Although success has been claimed only for
experiments with laboratory mice, one assumes the technique would be useful
for field mice. If I recall correctly, the mice responsible for these
"plagues" are house mice, _Mus musculus_, which are not native to Australia
but which have been associated with human habitation, world-wide, for
thousands of years (see Leviticus). I wonder whether Australian non-human
predators have come to rely on these animals as a food source. No matter
really; the damage done by these mice is extraordinary and must be addressed
as soon as possible. It's a "them or us" outlook. Delivery of a gene that
produces a protein to which the vertebrate produces antibody would be one way
to bring about mouse birth control. Other aspects of application of such a
system to field use is another issue altogether, which the Australian
Government surely must be discussing. -- Mod CHC]
