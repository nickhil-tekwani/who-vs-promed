Mountain lion hunters, domestic cat owners and others who may come in
contact with mountain lions in Wyoming and other western states are
urged to protect themselves and their animals against plague.

"Plague was confirmed in a mountain lion found dead in mid-April 2008
by a landowner in rural Johnson County," said Todd Cornish, an
associate professor in the University of Wyoming College of
Agriculture's Department of Veterinary Sciences.

Cornish said this is the 5th case of plague confirmed in mountain
lions in Wyoming in the past 3 years. The other 4 cases were in Teton
County and the Greater Yellowstone Area of northwestern Wyoming.

"Plague is an important consideration when mountain lions are found
sick or dead in Wyoming and elsewhere in the western United States,"
Cornish said.

Those who find sick or dead mountain lions or similar species,
including bobcats, should avoid contact with the animals and are
asked to contact the Wyoming Game and Fish Department (WGFD), Cornish
said. Contact information for regional offices can be found on the
WGFD website at
<http://gf.state.wy.us/admin/regional/index.asp>.

"Appropriate personal safety precautions should be taken by wildlife
professionals working in the field and diagnosticians working in
laboratories when handling these animals or their tissues," he added.
Information on how people can protect themselves is available on the
Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory (WSVL) website at
<http://wyovet.uwyo.edu/Disease_Updates.asp>.

"Plague is a serious zoonotic disease capable of causing significant
illness and even death in humans, as exemplified by a recent fatal
case of plague in a wildlife biologist working at Grand Canyon
National Park (in Arizona)," Cornish said. A zoonotic disease is one
that can be transmitted from animals to humans.

The National Park Service biologist, Eric York, 37, performed a
necropsy of a mountain lion carcass last October [2007], and
approximately 5 days later, he developed a high temperature, mild
nausea, muscle aches, chills, a cough and streaks of blood in his
saliva, according to an article in the April 2008 edition of the
Newsletter of the Wildlife Disease Association (WDA).

York died several days later, and specimens from the biologist and
the mountain lion both tested positive for the bacterium that causes
plague, _Yersinia pestis_, according to the WDA article.

Wildlife biologists, wildlife veterinarians, public health officials,
hunters skinning an animal with plague and the owners of domestic
cats stricken with the disease are among those susceptible to plague.
Cats can contract plague by eating an infected rodent or by being
bitten by fleas from an infected host.

Cornish said: "What's becoming more of a common recommendation is to
avoid allowing your cats to hunt wildlife. Concerned cat owners
should also consider visiting with their veterinarian about a
flea-control program."

There have been one fatal and 4 non-fatal cases of humans contracting
plague in Wyoming since 1978, said Karl Musgrave, state public health
veterinarian with the Wyoming Department of Health. There were 2
cases in Washakie County and one each in Goshen, Laramie and Sheridan counties.

The 1992 Sheridan County case resulted in the death of a man after he
contracted the disease when skinning an infected bobcat. The Goshen
County case involved a resident of Colorado.

WGFD assistant veterinarian Cynthia Tate said: "Finding plague in
animals such as mountain lions and bobcats -- and occasionally
domestic cats -- is not surprising because they eat rodents, and
rodents are the typical carriers."

Tate added: "Those who hunt or trap predators should protect
themselves while skinning animals or handling traps by wearing long
rubber or latex gloves. They should avoid contact with an animal that
appears sick (rough hair, coat and/or drainage out of the eyes) and
immediately contact the WGFD."

Tate cautions that animals having plague may not appear sick because
the disease can kill rapidly. The incubation period of plague is
between 2 and 6 days after exposure, she noted. If hunters or others
develop flu-like symptoms within that period, they should call their doctor.

Ken Mills, a professor in the UW Department of Veterinary Sciences,
said: "Plague could be a risk to mountain lion hunters, but I see it
as more of a risk to the owners of domestic cats allowed to go
outside and hunt rodents."

There have been at least 7 unrelated cases of plague in domestic cats
in Wyoming since 2005, Mills said. They included 4 in Laramie County
and one each in Albany, Natrona and Teton counties.

"If your cat develops a fever and has swollen lymph nodes, it is
definitely time to call a veterinarian," he said.

[Cats are sensitive indicators of plague. The size of the cat is
immaterial, and these cases demonstrate the sensitivity. Prairie dogs
are more sensitive than cats, but nevertheless, cats are quite sensitive.

Often, plague in cats, particularly domestic cats, may initially be
confused with a cat fight or cat bite abscess, as there are often
swellings in the mandibular region. These swellings are buboes,
abscesses from a fight. Consequently, veterinarians, technicians,
animal shelter workers and animal caretakers may be come victims when
buboes rupture.

Plague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is an acute and sometimes fatal
bacterial zoonosis that is transmitted primarily by the fleas of rats
and other rodents. Enzootic foci of sylvatic plague exist in the
western USA and throughout the world, including Eurasia, Africa, and
North and South America. In addition to rodents, other mammalian
species that have been naturally infected with _Y. pestis_ include
lagomorphs, felids, canids, mustelids, and some ungulates. Domestic
cats and dogs have also developed plague from oral mucous membrane
exposure to infected rodent tissues, typically when they are allowed
to roam and hunt in enzootic areas. Birds and other non-mammalian
vertebrates appear to be resistant to plague. On average, 10 human
plague cases are reported each year in the USA; the majority are from
New Mexico, California, Colorado, and Arizona. Most human cases
result from the bite of an infected flea, although direct contact
with infected wild rabbits, rodents, and occasionally other wildlife
and exposure to infected domestic cats are also risk factors.

_Y. pestis_ is a gram-negative, nonmotile, coccobacillus belonging to
the _Enterobacteriacae_ family. It exhibits a bipolar staining,
"safety pin" appearance when stained with Wright, Giemsa, or Wayson
stains. _Y. pestis_ grows slowly even at optimal temperatures (28 C)
and can require greater than 48 hours to produce colonies. Several
types of media can be used to grow _Y. pestis_, including blood agar,
nutrient broth, and un-enriched agar. Colonies are small (1-2 mm),
gray, nonmucoid, and have a characteristic "hammered copper"
appearance. Different virulence factors are expressed by the organism
at different temperatures and environments, allowing the organism to
survive in flea vectors and then be transmitted to and multiply in
mammalian hosts. The organism does not survive for long at high
temperatures or in dry environments.

_Y. pestis_ is easily destroyed by sunlight and drying. Even so, when
released into air, the bacterium will survive for up to one hour,
although this could vary depending on conditions.

Pneumonic plague is one of several forms of plague. Depending on
circumstances, these forms may occur separately or in combination.

Pneumonic plague occurs when _Y. pestis_ infects the lungs. This type
of plague can spread from person to person through the air.
Transmission can take place if someone breathes in aerosolized
bacteria, which could happen in a bioterrorist attack. Pneumonic
plague is also spread by breathing in _Y. pestis_ suspended in
respiratory droplets from a person (or animal) with pneumonic plague.
Becoming infected in this way usually requires direct and close
contact with the ill person or animal. Pneumonic plague may also
occur if a person with bubonic or septicemic plague is untreated and
the bacteria spread to the lungs.

Bubonic plague is the most common form of plague. This occurs when an
infected flea bites a person or when materials contaminated with _Y.
pestis_ enter through a break in a person's skin. Patients develop
swollen, tender lymph glands (called buboes) and fever, headache,
chills, and weakness. Bubonic plague does not spread from person to person.

Septicemic plague occurs when plague bacteria multiply in the blood.
It can be a complication of pneumonic or bubonic plague or it can
occur by itself. When it occurs alone, it is caused in the same ways
as bubonic plague; however, buboes do not develop. Patients have
fever, chills, prostration, abdominal pain, shock, and bleeding into
skin and other organs. Septicemic plague does not spread from person to person.

Symptoms and Treatment:
With pneumonic plague, the 1st signs of illness are fever, headache,
weakness, and rapidly developing pneumonia with shortness of breath,
chest pain, cough, and sometimes bloody or watery sputum. The
pneumonia progresses for 2 to 4 days and may cause respiratory
failure and shock. Without early treatment, patients may die.

Early treatment of pneumonic plague is essential. To reduce the
chance of death, antibiotics must be given within 24 hours of 1st
symptoms. Streptomycin, gentamicin, the tetracyclines, and
chloramphenicol are all effective against pneumonic plague.

Antibiotic treatment for 7 days will protect people who have had
direct, close contact with infected patients. Wearing a close-fitting
surgical mask also protects against infection.

A plague vaccine is not currently available for use in the United States.
