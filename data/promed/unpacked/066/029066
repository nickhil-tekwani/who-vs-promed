Avian cholera, a disease that can quickly kill bird populations, has been
diagnosed in 6 dead seagulls, Newfoundland and Labrador's chief
veterinarian reported Tuesday.
Hugh Whitney said the disease poses minimal risk to humans. He called on
the public to avoid contact with birds they suspect may be infected with
avian cholera.
However, the disease can cause what Whitney described as "large-scale
die-offs in waterfowl and other bird populations."
Sick gulls have been reported at various offshore sites. As well,
investigators are responding to reports of gull infections around the St.
John's area, particularly at Quidi Vidi Lake in the city's east end.
Quidi Vidi Lake is a frequent stop for seagulls, and is near both a large
landfill and the Atlantic Ocean.
Whitney advised the public to avoid contact with birds that may be
infected, and to keep pets away. "The risk in contact with the sick or dead
birds may include a skin infection if exposure is with an open cut,"
Whitney said in a statement.
The disease has so far been found in 3 gull species: great black-backed
gulls, glaucous gulls and black-legged kittiwakes.
Avian cholera, a bacteria-based disease, can spread to other bird species,
particularly scavengers such as crows, ravens and eagles.
"Affected birds may be seen lying on the ground, circling in the water with
their heads twisting in different directions or found dead in areas where
gulls roost," Whitney said. "Death is usually very quick."
Whitney called on poultry farmers to look after their stock and to try to
keep gulls and scavengers from their premises.

A discussion of Avian Cholera may be found in ProMED-mail posting
200610231.3119.
Since avian cholera can kill quickly, it is not unusual to see a die-off of
large number of birds quite suddenly. But seagulls are not one we often
hear about.
