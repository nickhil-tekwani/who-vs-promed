West Nile disease is spreading across southern Europe, including 24 confirmed cases in France, with experts calling it the "biggest epidemic seen in our country."

The Mediterranean area reported the 1st case of the virus in July 2018. There have now been 24 cases diagnosed across the Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur, Occitanie, and Corsica regions; as well as 550 cases in Italy and 300 in Greece.

West Nile virus is spread by _Culex_ mosquitoes, which carry the virus from infected birds and horses into humans. The virus can only be carried by mosquitoes and cannot be spread from horse to human, or between humans themselves.

The virus can go on to cause West Nile disease, with around 20 percent of infected humans going on to develop a fever.

When it shows up, after an incubation period of 3-15 days, flu-like symptoms will occur, including fever, headache, fatigue, joint and muscle pain. Older people over 50 are more at risk.

For 80 percent of infected people, there are no symptoms, but one in 150 will develop a severe case of the illness, causing neurological problems such as meningitis, paralysis or Guillain-Barre syndrome, which affects the nerves and immune system.

So far in France, 6 people have required hospitalisation due to a severe case, but according to the Agence Régionale de Santé (ARS), they should all make a full recovery.

In Greece and Italy, 85 people have died. There are no antiviral drugs or vaccination for West Nile disease, so infected people are given treatment to help their symptoms, and authorities are more focused on prevention.

West Nile virus was 1st discovered in 1937, and in France in 1962. Dr Marie-Claire Paty, epidemiologist at health body Santé Publique France, said: "The 2018 epidemic is the biggest we have ever seen in our country. Hot years help the virus get worse, and it has now probably become permanent in the south of France."

To prevent the virus, anti-mosquito measures are the best course of action. Authorities recommend getting rid of any stagnant water around your property, wearing clothes that cover the skin, using anti-mosquito sprays and creams, and sleeping under a mosquito net.

Anyone infected by the virus is not allowed to give blood, with 6 departments in the affected area in France now offering tests to check for infection before any giving takes place.

Dr Christophe Besiers, deputy medical director at the blood donation agency Etablissement Français du Sang (EFS), said: "This measure was already in place in 2015 and 2017, but this is the 1st time it has been in place for so long."

Anyone wanting to give blood who has travelled and stayed in an affected region -- including in the Mediterranean, but also the USA and Canada -- should also make this clear beforehand.

Between 19 and 25 Oct 2018, EU Member States reported 24 human West Nile virus (WNV) infections in Croatia (8), Romania (8), Greece (5) and Bulgaria (3). EU neighbouring countries reported 24 cases: Serbia (13) and Kosovo* (11).

All human cases were reported from areas that have been affected during previous transmission seasons. This week, 8 deaths were reported by Romania (4), Kosovo* (2), Bulgaria (1) and Greece (1).

In the same week, 18 outbreaks among equids were reported by Italy (8), France (3), Hungary (3), Spain (3) and Greece (1).

In 2018, as of 25 Oct 2018, EU Member States have reported 1460 human cases in Italy (550), Greece (307), Romania (276), Hungary (212), Croatia (53), France (24), Austria (19), Bulgaria (14), Slovenia (3) and the Czech Republic (2). EU neighbouring countries reported 522 human cases in Serbia (398), Israel (110) and Kosovo* (14). To date, 170 deaths due to West Nile virus infection have been reported by Italy (44), Greece (42), Romania (42), Serbia (35), Kosovo* (3), Bulgaria (2), the Czech Republic (1) and Hungary (1).

In September 2018, a veterinarian was diagnosed with suspected WNV infection after performing an autopsy on a deceased owl found in a wildlife park near Poing, Ebersberg, Bavaria, Germany. WNV was detected in the owl by PCR in tissue samples recovered during the autopsy.

During the current transmission season, 261 outbreaks among equids have been reported by Italy (136), Hungary (87), Greece (15), France (11), Romania (2), Germany (2), Spain (5), Austria (1), Slovenia (1) and Portugal (1).

In accordance with European Commission Directive 2014/110/EU, prospective blood donors should defer for 28 days after leaving an area with evidence of West Nile virus circulation among humans unless the results of an individual nucleic acid test are negative.

*This designation is without prejudice to positions on status and is in line with UNSCR 1244 and the International Court of Justice Opinion on the Kosovo Declaration of Independence.

[3] West Nile and Usutu virus infections, human, eastern Austria, 2018
Date: 27 Oct 2018
From: Norbert Nowotny <Norbert.Nowotny@vetmeduni.ac.at> [edited]


I wish to draw your attention to a rapid communication published in the most recent issue of Eurosurveillance (https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2018.23.43.1800545), in which we report during the 2018 transmission season the highest ever number of human West Nile and Usutu virus infections in Austria.

Between 28 Jun and 17 Sep 2018, 27 cases of human West Nile virus infections were recorded, of which 21 were locally acquired. Four cases were West Nile neuroinvasive disease, 11 cases were West Nile fever, 6 were West Nile virus infections detected by blood donation screening, and 6 cases were associated with travels to Serbia (n = 2), Italy (n = 1), Greece (n = 1), Hungary (n = 1), and Croatia (n = 1). All autochthonous West Nile virus infections were acquired in the eastern part of Austria.

It is also noteworthy that Usutu virus infections were identified in 18 of 31 598 blood donations tested. Although Usutu virus, which is genetically closely related to West Nile virus, seems to be less pathogenic for humans than West Nile virus, it might cause severe disease in immunocompromised patients or might be involved in other neurological disorders.

Usutu virus is currently spreading across Europe, which may lead to increased numbers of human infections. In countries with blood donation testing for flavivirus nucleic acid, health authorities should be aware that -- because of cross reactions between the 2 viruses -- positive West Nile virus screening results could be due to Usutu virus infections and have to be further differentiated. In addition, countries where blood donation testing is not performed for flaviviruses, Usutu virus might be transmitted through contaminated blood units. Although no transfusion-associated Usutu virus infection has been reported so far, the clinical relevance of Usutu virus infections in humans needs to be explored further.

[ProMED thanks Dr Nowotny for his submission on detection of Usutu virus in a small percentage of tested blood donations. The cross reactivity between the WNV and Usutu virus due to genetic similarity can complicate interpretation of positive results in blood donors and further complicates the testing protocols employed for WNV identification.

Usutu virus, a mosquito-borne flavivirus, was 1st discovered in South Africa in 1959 and is maintained in bird reservoirs. The 1st human case was identified in the Central African Republic in 1981. The virus was 1st detected in Europe in 2001 in wild bird populations in Austria, and the continent's 1st documented human cases were in Italy in 2009. These European cases were also the 1st to exhibit neurological manifestation of the disease, as the only 2 previous cases in Africa exhibited fever, rash, and jaundice. This relatively unknown and emerging zoonotic virus highlights the importance of vector-borne disease surveillance for human health.

Usutu virus is a neurotropic virus, meaning that it has the capacity to affect the nervous system. In humans, it has resulted in symptoms ranging from fever to meningoencephalitis, though in most of these cases, this was seen in patents who suffered from co-morbidities. At this time, Usutu virus has not been observed to exhibit person-to-person transmission, although similar viruses have demonstrated this capability (e.g. sexual transmission in Zika). The newly identified case had no documented history of recent travel, and it is believed that he acquired the infection locally. Usutu virus has been determined to be endemic in several European countries and was recently found to be circulating in France (https://www.outbreakobservatory.org/outbreakthursday-1/6/28/2018/newly-identified-human-infection-with-usutu-virus).

This most recent Usutu virus infection (22nd documented case) was identified through a retrospective study that analyzed the cerebrospinal fluid collected from patients in 2016 in 2 towns in southern France. The specimens that were tested were collected as part of a surveillance for arbovirus infections that is conducted annually in the area from May-November every year. The man originally presented with acute onset facial paralysis (or Bell's Palsy), droopy eyelids, and distorted taste sensation in November 2016 (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/24/5/17-1122_article).

A 2011 study of the Usutu virus in Africa noted the "striking" fact that the virus had only been isolated in African countries with entomological surveillance programs, raising the prospect that the geographic distribution of the virus could be substantially wider than previously reported. Similarly, it is theorized that the virus has been introduced from Africa into Europe in multiple events starting approximately 50 years ago. In fact, a 2013 study determined that a die-off of wild birds in Italy in 1996 was actually caused by Usutu virus 6 years before it was 1st identified on the continent (https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/vbz.2011.0631?journalCode=vbz).

The variation in clinical presentation of Usutu virus infection complicates disease detection and surveillance efforts. There seems to be a difference in the clinical manifestation of the disease between the cases in Africa and those in Europe. However, this distinction is based on a very small sample size, including only 2 cases in Africa; considerable further research is required to make any determination. Difference in disease severity in birds has also been reported, and phylogenetic data indicate that the virus is evolving independently in Europe and Africa (https://mbio.asm.org/content/7/1/e01938-15.full).

The variation in clinical presentation with the Usutu virus also poses a risk of misdiagnosis, particularly considering that some of the symptoms are similar to many other diseases. The fact that this most recent case of Usutu virus infection in France was not detected until a retrospective study was performed 2 years later is a clear example of the potential for Usutu virus, and similar pathogens, to enter human populations undetected. Reliable data on the geographic spread of the virus are critical to informing clinicians of the risk so that they can include Usutu virus infection in their differential diagnosis and to educating the public so that they can take proper protective measures.

As noted above, vector-borne surveillance programs have been critical in detecting Usutu virus circulation in animal populations as well as detecting human cases. Accurate information about infectious disease risks enables health officials and clinicians to better protect the public's health, and robust, proactive surveillance systems are vital to obtaining this information. While often underappreciated as tools for protecting human health, animal and vector-borne disease surveillance systems provide data and insight into human health risks that may otherwise go uncollected. - Mod.UBA
