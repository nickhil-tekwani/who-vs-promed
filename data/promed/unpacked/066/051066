[1] Cholera - Kenya (Mombasa)

CAFOD (Catholic Agency for Overseas Development) is supporting a
local organization in coastal Kenya as it races to stem the spread of
an outbreak of cholera following the floods.
The public health officer in Mombasa district has reported 28 cases
of cholera in 3 densely populated areas following the floods, that
are said to have affected over 60 000 people in coastal provinces.
Today, CAFOD's partner, the Archdiocese of Mombasa, is distributing
disinfectants and sample kits to enable communities to test and treat
their wells and water tanks to prevent further transmission of the
water-borne disease. The Kenyan government has supplied chlorine
but the public health office appealed to the Archdiocese for help
with providing these vital chemicals and pieces of equipment to
tackle the situation in Changamwe, Likoni and Kisauni
divisions. Medicines for cholera and diarrhea are also being sent
for people who are already sick.
Responding to this latest need is part of a joint Caritas program
that is assisting flood victims in both the Mombasa area on the coast
and Garissa in Northern Kenya.

[2] Cholera - Tanzania (Dar es Salaam)

Officials of the Dar es Salaam Region are still at work, despite the
passing of a 2-week deadline by Tanzanian Prime Minister Edward
Lowassa to end the cholera epidemic or lose their jobs.
The deadline expired on Sun, 3 Dec 2006, and health centers continued
to report newly infected cholera cases. City Medical Officer Deo
Mutasiwa said that by Tue, 5 Dec 2006, 29 patients had been admitted
to different clinics in Dar es Salaam, although the overall infection
rate in the city was declining.
Dar es Salaam Regional Commissioner Abbas Kandoro had earlier told
Lowassa that from 20 Nov to 12 Dec 2006, 11 227 people had contracted
the disease in the region. Of these cases, Kandoro had said, 117 died
in Dar es Salaam, the nation's commercial capital with about 3
million residents.
Health officials say cholera is transmitted via the faecal-oral route
and blame its almost endemic prevalence in the country on poor public
hygiene standards and the lack of individual precautions such as
boiling drinking water. Hotel and restaurant owners told IRIN that
city health officials had stepped up inspections, following orders by
Kandoro for strict surveillance of the city's restaurants, hotels and bars.
Furthermore, the cultivation of vegetables within city limits, where
farmers used suspected toxic water on their vegetable patches, has
been banned. Vegetables were being planted in conduits for domestic
sewers and industrial effluent that run into the sea.

[4] Cholera - Angola

More than 2500 people in Angola have died of cholera since an
epidemic broke out in February, UNICEF said Fri, 8 Dec 2006.
The disease claimed 2584 lives with new cases still being reported in
5 provinces in the south and north of the country, the UN agency said
in a statement.
The epidemic, which started in Luanda, the capital, has spread to 16
of the southwest African country's 18 provinces. Government officials
have reported a total of 62 300 cases, UNICEF said.
The agency is particularly concerned about the threat the epidemic
poses to children under 5, who make up about 35 percent of cases,
UNICEF spokesman Michael Bociurkiw said.
As part of the effort to combat the spread of the disease, UNICEF
said it is handing out water dispensers, water purification tablets
and soap in affected areas.
A 2-decade civil war that ended in 2002 crippled Angola's public
infrastructure, including health care and sanitation systems.
