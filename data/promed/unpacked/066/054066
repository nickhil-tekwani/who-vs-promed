Officials in Ukraine's Crimea peninsula said on Wednesday [18 Jan 2006]
that new cases of bird flu had been detected among wild birds and urged
residents to exercise caution to prevent a spread to domestic livestock.
Officials said that tests showed 5 birds found dead in the port of
Sevastopol -- including a seagull discovered in the courtyard of a
kindergarten -- had been infected with bird flu. A municipal spokesman said
the city had been declared a "potentially dangerous zone" after the discovery.
Residents in and around Sevastopol, home to Russia's Black Sea Fleet and
Ukraine's small navy, were told to keep domestic birds in enclosures and to
destroy any with suspicious symptoms. Testing in Ukraine is insufficiently
sophisticated to detect the deadly H5N1 bird flu strain -- which has
already been found in other regions of Crimea, a key centre for migratory
birds jutting out into the Black Sea.
No human cases of bird flu have been recorded.
Specialised teams of sanitary workers have already destroyed well over 200
000 birds in Ukraine -- both privately held and at industrial plants --
since the discovery of the H5N1 virus in a dozen villages in north eastern
Crimea late in 2005.
Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly said that the outbreak is under
control but expect further difficulties when migratory birds pass through
Ukraine on their way north in the spring.

Avian influenza in Turkey: situation update, 18 Jan 2006
--------------------------------------------------------
There are still confirmed H5 outbreaks in poultry in 13 different
provinces, and suspected outbreaks are [being] investigated in [a further]
19 of the 81 provinces of Turkey.
It should be [taken into consideration] that even one single bird with
confirmed H5N1 is counted as an outbreak.

According to the Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tue, 17 Jan
2006, "Nearly one million poultry have been culled so far (due to bird flu)
in Turkey, and breeders were paid compensation,".

I have some questions about H5N1 HPAI that I hope others might find
interesting and respond to.
1) Does anyone have any information about the time from infection to the
start of shedding of the virus compared to the onset of clinical signs and
increased mortality? This is an important point for undertaking both
forward and backward tracings and knowing how much spread there might have
been before an outbreak is detected. I realise that it will be variable
both in general and perhaps between different species, but I think a
ballpark figure would help. This period of "silent spread" is critical to
the size of outbreaks. So far I haven't been able to find much information
on how long this period is for HPAI in general, let alone H5N1.
2) Vaccination of poultry is being used in various countries. I can see how
this will work in large-scale commercial farms, especially when these are
all-in, all-out single-age sites; each batch can be vaccinated at birth or
some other life stage. But my experience of village poultry is that they
are multi-age and that there is a very rapid turnover in the population
(over 100 per cent per year, or around 10 per cent per month in my
experience), which would suggest a rapidly waning flock immunity.
For vaccination to work in that sort of situation, a one-off vaccination
campaign is rarely effective; it is usually necessary to have constant
supplies of vaccine available for administration when required. Am I right
about this and is it achievable?
3) A lot of disease is being found in areas where migratory wildfowl either
pass through or over-winter. I wonder if most outbreaks are being found in
these areas because that is where surveillance is being concentrated,
rather than because that is the only place where the virus is present.
Might the example of the recent outbreaks in Turkey suggest that widespread
surveillance is required, not so focused on wildfowl? I want to emphasise
that I intend absolutely no criticism of the Turkish veterinary services
when I say that -- quite the opposite; I have a lot of sympathy for the
very difficult situation they have been faced with.

I believe I read H5N1 antibodies had been detected in pigs many months ago.
With all the bird monitoring going on, I wondered if anyone was monitoring
pigs or other animals that might be shedding virus without noticeable symptoms.

[Responses to the above queries, from first-hand sources, are welcome.
The following additional information from Romania and Georgia is added:
1. Romania:
On 17 Jan 2006, Romania notified the OIE on 2 new outbreaks of H5, in
Braila County: one in the village of Ciresu, the other one in the village
of Dudesti. Reportedly, both outbreaks started on 10 Jan 2006.(see
<http://oie.int/downld/AVIAN%20INFLUENZA/Romania%20Follow%20up%20report%20060117.pdf>).
The following control measures have reportedly been applied in both
affected localities since 13 Jan 2006:
- partial stamping-out, in the infected premises and in neighbouring
backyard premises (there were 6 premises in Dudesti where 127 fowls were
culled and 10 premises in Ciresu where 157 fowls have been culled);
- movement control measures, applied to people and to animals (poultry,
poultry products, feed, etc);
- disinfection of backyard premises in the locality;
- sanitary checkpoints ("filters") installed at the entrance of the localities.
- destruction of carcasses, assured by burning and burying.
2. Georgia:
Mikheil Svimonishvili, Georgian agriculture minister, stated on 18 Jan 2006
that the fact that the bird flu has not been detected after examination of
385 dead hens is not an argument for serenity. - Mod.AS]
