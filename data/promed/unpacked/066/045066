Update on human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1)
virus infection, 2010
-----------------------------------
This report describes the epidemiology of the 48 human cases of
symptomatic illness caused by laboratory confirmed infection with
influenza A(H5N1) virus that were reported to WHO during 2010. All 48
cases occurred as sporadic cases, with no clusters reported.

Temporal and geographical distribution
--------------------------------------
Although cases occurred throughout the year, there was a marked
seasonal variation with the peak occurring between December and March
2010, during the northern hemisphere winter. In 2010, most human cases
occurred in the northern hemisphere -- with the exception of those in
Indonesia, which straddles the equator -- in both temperate and
tropical areas.

The number of cases in individual countries was too small to
determine whether seasonality differed among countries with different
climates. The seasonal variation in human cases parallels that of
outbreaks in birds.

The highest number of cases was reported from Egypt (29 cases),
followed by Indonesia (9), Viet Nam (7), China (2), and Cambodia (1).
All of these countries have reported human cases previously, including
in 2009, and all are countries where influenza A(H5N1) virus is
believed to be circulating widely in poultry. Egypt and Indonesia have
officially declared the virus endemic in poultry, and information from
the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization suggests that the
influenza A(H5N1) virus is also endemic in poultry in Viet Nam and
parts of China as well as in Bangladesh. In Cambodia, the virus
appears to be reintroduced sporadically in poultry.

Distribution by sex and age
---------------------------
In 2010, most cases occurred in children and young adults; 83 percent
(40/48) of cases occurred in people aged younger than 40 years. Cases
ranged in age from 1-59 years, with a median age of 25 years. The
median age of cases in 2010 was slightly higher than the median of 19
years for all cases from all countries since 2003. Egypt in 2010 had a
higher median age of 27 years compared with a median age of 3 years in
2009, and 10 years for all previous years combined. In 2010, there
were half as many cases in male than in females (ratio of male to
female cases, 1:2), although this difference was not uniformly
distributed among countries nor was the sex distribution consistent
among age groups. Females made up a much larger proportion of cases
aged 20-29 years, which is consistent with data from previous years.
The sex difference in 2010 was most notable in Indonesia (ratio of
males to females, 1:8) and for Viet Nam (ratio of males to females,
1:6). In contrast, cases in Egypt were more evenly distributed: the
ratio of males to females was 1:1.2. Historically, when all cases from
all countries are considered, the sex of cases is almost equally
distributed between males and females (ratio of males to females,
1:1.1).

Outcome
-------
Half (n = 24) of the 48 cases died. The case-fatality ratio (CFR)
differed by country: Viet Nam had the lowest CFR (7 cases; CFR, 28
percent). For all countries in 2010, women had a higher CFR than men
(56 percent versus 38 percent). There have been 516 cases since 2003,
and the CFR has been higher for women for all years taken together (65
percent versus 53 percent); however, this difference has not been
observed in every country and may be related to factors such as age.
During 2010, the CFR was highest among those aged 30-39 years (CFR, 70
percent) and lowest among those aged 0-9 years (CFR, 30 percent), but
the difference was not significant. When all 516 cases from 2003 to
2010 are included, cases aged less than 20 years have a significantly
lower risk of dying than those aged more than 20 years (CFR 52 percent
versus 66 percent; OR [odds ratio], 0.56; 95 percent CI [confidence
interval], 0.39-0.81); however, this observation is not consistent for
every country.

Time from onset to hospitalization
----------------------------------
The time from onset of illness to hospitalization was available for
42 cases; it ranged from 0 days to 12 days, with a median of 4 days.
Cases that died were admitted to hospital later (median, 5 days) after
onset than those who survived (median, 2 days). The CFR for cases who
were hospitalized within 2 or less days of onset was lower than for
those hospitalized more than 2 days after onset (CFR, 25 percent
versus 65 percent; OR, 5.6; 95 percent CI, 1.4-22.7). For all cases
from all years, those who died were hospitalized later than those who
survived (median 5 days after onset versus 2 days; Kruskal-Wallis test
P = 0.0001), and when cases were hospitalized 2 or less days from
onset, they were more likely to survive than those hospitalized more
than 2 days after onset (CFR, 29 percent versus 71 percent; OR, 5.9;
95 percent CI, 3.7-9.3).

Exposure data
-------------
Data on exposure were available for 37 cases. In 32 of the cases,
exposure to sick or dead poultry was noted; no other exposures were
reported. Of the cases reporting exposure to sick or dead poultry, 4
were reported to have slaughtered poultry, and 2 disposed of dead
poultry. Three cases were associated with occupational exposure: one
worked with fertilizers of animal origin, one worked in a live-bird
market, and one worked slaughtering and defeathering poultry. Two of
the 37 for whom data on exposure were available reported being exposed
in live-bird markets. Data on exposure were inconclusive or
unavailable for 11 cases. However, poultry, some of which were sick,
were reported to have been present near the households of 5 of these
cases.

Virological information
-----------------------
Influenza A(H5N1) viruses have continued to diversify, both
genetically and antigenically. During 2010, viruses characterized from
human cases belonged to clade 1 (Cambodia), clade 2.2.1, group C
(Egypt), clade 2.3.2 (China, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region),
and clade 2.3.4 (Viet Nam). Viruses from these clades have also been
isolated from poultry in each country. None of 9 human isolates from
2010 that have been sequenced had the neuraminidase mutations known to
predict resistance to oseltamivir.

Discussion
----------
Human infection with influenza A(H5N1) virus remains uncommon and
sporadic despite continued widespread circulation of the virus in
poultry in some countries. As in previous years, countries reporting
human cases were those where the virus circulates in poultry; there
continues to be no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission.

The general epidemiological picture of human cases of infection with
influenza A(H5N1) is unchanged. Women seem to have a worse outcome
than men, and the disease appears more likely to be mild in children.
Overall, children and young adults seem to be more frequently
diagnosed with the infection, although the median age increased in
2010, primarily in association with an increase in the age of cases in
Egypt. Early recognition of infection and hospitalization are likely
to lead to favorable outcomes. A recent analysis of 119 cases
occurring in Egypt since 2006 reaffirms these observations.

Investigators there found a significant increase in CFR with the age
of the case and among females when compared with males. In addition,
early hospitalization was found to have a positive impact on survival.
WHO continues to recommend that clinicians in endemic countries be
encouraged to consider influenza A(H5N1) infection when patients
present with compatible clinical and epidemiological features, and to
treat patients early with appropriate antiviral medications.

Influenza A(H5N1) virus remains an avian virus that has not
substantially changed in its zoonotic behavior since emerging. The
genetic and antigenic diversification of circulating influenza A(H5N1)
viruses, however, require the development of multiple candidate
vaccine viruses for purposes of pandemic preparedness. There are no
signs of increasing antiviral resistance to oseltamivir in influenza A
(H5N1) viruses or re-assortment with any of the circulating human
influenza viruses.

Most human cases are exposed through direct or indirect contact with
poultry or contaminated environments and, as in previous years, the
exposures that result in symptomatic infection happen almost
exclusively in households or markets rather than in association with
commercial poultry. People who are infected are often reported to have
slaughtered or prepared birds for consumption, and visits to live-bird
markets continue to be reported as potential venues for exposure to
infection. However, in most of the areas where human cases have been
reported, multiple exposures to potentially infected poultry or to
environments where poultry live are a routine part of daily life.
Because of this, it is difficult to determine which specific exposures
lead to human infection and disease. It is, therefore, important for
animal health and public health partners to continue to work together
to identify and manage common risks and to decrease human exposure at
the human-animal interface, particularly in households and in
live-bird markets. Because some risk of human exposure will remain as
long as the virus circulates widely among poultry, it is also
important that the animal health sector continues its efforts to
control the virus at its source, that is, in animal populations.

Current knowledge about influenza A(H5N1) infection in humans has
been acquired thanks to the countries that have collected and openly
shared information about their cases. WHO would like to recognize the
contribution of the countries which reported cases in 2010. However,
there is a need to do more, both in terms of comprehensive data
collection, contextual analysis, and the sharing of linked
virological, epidemiological, and clinical data. There are still
unanswered questions about the epidemiology of the disease in animals,
and these are being addressed by the animal health sector. In
addition, there are specific issues about the disease in humans and at
the human-animal interface that need to be addressed through targeted
research, including clearly identifying the factors that facilitate
transmission to humans, further defining the spectrum of illness and
the magnitude of mild or asymptomatic disease, and identifying the
virological and genetic markers for transmissibility and virulence in
humans. Finally, laboratories which identify influenza A viruses that
are not seasonal subtypes are encouraged to submit these samples
immediately for further characterization to a WHO Collaborating Centre
on influenza.

[This report presents the epidemiological description of 48 human
cases of avian influenza, with Egypt reporting the highest number: 29
cases (60 percent of the cases reported in 2010). All the cases
occurred sporadically with no evidence of human-to-human transmission.
High risk groups for infection included persons handling sick or
diseased poultry at the household level, persons visiting live bird
markets, children and young adults, and persons who delay seeking
hospitalization following onset of disease symptoms.
