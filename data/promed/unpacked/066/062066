A total of 18 people in Dokolo district have died of sleeping
sickness. The director of health services, Dr Samuel Ojok, said the
latest death occurred last week [week of 2 Mar 2009] and that 11
other people were still admitted and undergoing treatment at Dokolo
Health Centre IV. "The cases have become common and we are asking
people to come for testing in case anyone feels feverish," Ojok told
journalists at the health centre on Monday[9 Mar 2009]. He said the
disease spread to the district in 2004 following the arrival of
infected animals from the Busoga region for sale by businessmen. Ojok
said because the disease presented itself in a confusing form,
patients diagnosed with malaria were also being tested for the virus.
He added that many people were unaware of the symptoms and that it
had resulted into late reporting of the disease. The district has so
far recorded 120 cases.

Sleeping sickness or human African trypanosomiasis is a parasitic
disease of people and animals caused by protozoa and transmitted by
the tsetse fly. Its symptoms begin with fever, headaches, and joint
pains after the parasites enter through both the blood and lymph
systems. The district information officer, Musopiri Suwet, said
Kwera, Kangai, and Dokolo sub-counties were affected with the
disease. "The campaign is ongoing and we are asking people to report
any person bitten by the tsetse fly," Suwet told The New Vision. The
World Health Organisation has released [UGX] 71 million [approx. USD
35 000] to help the district train health officials to contain the
tsetse fly, spray of animals, and follow up.

[Dokolo district is located approximately 200 km (124 mi) north of
Kampala (see map reference below). A recent review of trypanosomiasis
in Uganda concluded, "The distribution of sleeping sickness from
1905-1920 shows notable differences compared to the current
distribution of disease. In particular, archival cases were recorded
in south west and central Uganda, areas currently free of disease.
The disease focus has moved from lakeshore Buganda (1905-1920) to the
Busoga and south east districts" (Berrang-Ford L et al: Sleeping
sickness in Uganda: revisiting current and historical distributions.
Afr Health Sci. 2006; 6: 223-31. Available at
<http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1832067>).
The map in the paper shows that Lira district (until 2006 Dokolo
district was one of the counties of Lira), is an area where recent
outbreaks of human trypanosomiasis have been reported. However, the
description of an increase in the number of human cases indicates
that the transmission is increasing.
