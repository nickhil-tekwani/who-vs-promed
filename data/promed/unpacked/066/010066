Rift Valley fever (RVF) in Sudan - WHO Update 2
-----------------------------------------
As of Wed 14 Nov 2007, 329 human cases, including 96 deaths
(case-fatality rate, 29 percent) have been reported from White Nile,
Sennar, Gazeera states. Cases reported in Khartoum state are not
indigenous cases but were imported from one of the other affected
states. The most rapid increase in human cases has been seen in
Gazeera state, which now accounts for more than half of the human
cases. The cases being reported in Gazeera state are in an area close
to irrigation canals and are linked to naturally occurring cycles
involving livestock and mosquitoes which are abundant in the
irrigation zone.

On Sun 11 Nov 2007, the Sudanese Federal Ministry of Animal Resources
and Fisheries reported to the Office International des Epizooties
(OIE) that Rift Valley fever had been found on 29 Oct 2007 in samples
taken from animals in White Nile State. It is anticipated that
following this declaration, a well-integrated control program for
limiting the disease in both human and animal populations will now be
implemented.

The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations has
deployed a senior animal health expert to the country to assist
veterinary services with prevention and control measures in animals.
The Ministry of Health and the WHO Country Office have presented a
plan for the prevention and control of the disease in humans to
international donors in Khartoum. The WHO Eastern Mediterranean
Regional Office and WHO headquarters are supporting the national
response, mobilizing epidemiologists and working with partners to
enhance national laboratory capacity for RVF.

Social mobilization activities are now underway to alert the local
population to the human health risks associated with this disease in
animals. However, more intensive efforts are urgently needed using
all locally available media -- including television and radio
channels -- as well as community and religious leaders to ensure that
at-risk communities are fully aware of the measures that need to be
taken to reduce the risk of human infection.

[Since the last WHO report on Thu 8 Nov 2007, the number of human
cases has risen by 101 and the number of fatalities by 12. The most
rapid increase in cases is occurring in the eastern state of Gazeera.
A map of Sudan showing the location of the adjacent states of White
Nile, Sennar, and Gazeera, south of the capital Khartoum, is
available at

and the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Sudan can be accessed at
<http://healthmap.org/promed?v=13.8,30,5>.

The extent of the outbreak of Rift Valley fever in livestock in the
Central/Eastern states of Sudan remains confused and unclear, as
discussed in detail in ProMED-mail posts: Rift Valley fever, bovine,
ovine - Sudan: (West Nile), OIE 20071114.3694 and Rift Valley fever -
Sudan (05): animal involvement 20071111.3663. Further information is
awaited.
