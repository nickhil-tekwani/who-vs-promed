New Mexico officials are warning residents in the East Mountains and El Dorado counties of the bubonic plague, after 2 dogs reportedly came down with the disease.

Residents are advised to keep their dogs away from rodents -- including rabbits, chipmunks, and squirrels -- as they could be carrying plague infected fleas. Officials also recommend removing brush and clutter from around the home, which are hiding places for such animals.

"It is the plague," Mark Dimenna of the Environmental Health Department [EHD] said. Fortunately, human cases of plague are rare. Humans can be infected from direct contact with infected tissues or fluids while handling an animal that is sick or dead from plague. The disease can be effectively treated with antibiotics.

Symptoms of bubonic plague for humans include fever, headache, chills, and weakness, and swollen, tender and painful lymph nodes, according to the CDC.

Symptoms usually show up within 2 weeks of exposure to an infected animal or flea, county health officials said.

Dr Paul Smith, of the EHD, warned dog owners to be on the lookout for clinical signs in their dogs: fever, lethargy, and behavior that is "not normal." Cats can also be affected.

Most of the cases plague in the United States have been in the New Mexico, Arizona, and Colorado area and in Nevada, Oregon, and California.

"Plague is naturally present in many parts of California, including higher elevation of El Dorado County, so we all need to be cautious around animals that can carry it," Dr Alicia Paris-Pombo, the county's public health officer said.

Plague is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_.

Plague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the western USA. Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.

Plague is a potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections are rare but can be life-threatening. The plague case-fatality rate depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic) and timing of initiation of antibiotic therapy; if untreated, the case-fatality rate is over 50 per cent for bubonic plague and approaches 100 per cent for pneumonic plague. Rapid laboratory identification can help guide therapy.

Domestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners or, especially cats, serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets and available. Some products may be suitable for dogs but not cats, or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities.

Clinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities in your pet.

Veterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one palpating the swelling.

Another form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the respiratory infection.

You should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into your home via a pet vehicle can also transmit disease to you, the owner or caretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in enzootic areas. Plague patients with no history of exposure to rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected rodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea control to dog and cat owners.
