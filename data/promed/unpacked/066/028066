YELLOW FEVER IN ASIA (4)
========================
In regard to the YF/Dengue question: "What's the difference between the
Asian dengue and that found all over Africa and S. Amer., where YF also
abounds?"
It would be very helpful to resolve better this question of why no YF in
Indian subcontinent etc. Some favor another story, of course, that the
slave trading routes that brought YF bypassed this area [I always favored
this hypothesis, but a good geographer looking critically and accurately
at the geographic data is needed to analyze this. There could be separate
nonoverlapping populations of virus types or vectors.] but then how Ae.
aegypti got there needs to be addressed. I think the usual explanation was
that aegypti was introduced into Asia from a different part of Africa,
where they did not carry YF. Any data in support of either (or against
either) hypothesis? For example, I wonder if there are any molecular data
showing that S Amer Ae. aegypti are genetically distinct from the Asian
introductions; if so, one might be able to identify the founder populations
as well.)
The hypothesis that dengue prevents YF suggests a competition between these
viruses (possible, but one would like real data). This implies that either
(1) there are vector subpopulations, and the dengue-bearing mosquitoes
outcompete those bearing YF (testable by molecular population markers in
places where both dengue and YF coexist, for example, or possibly in the lab),
or (more likely) (2) dengue viruses and YF compete in the same vector,
implying that dengue-infected mosquitoes are refractory to YF infection, or
less competent for YF. This is a testable hypothesis -- so are there any data
from e.g., lab studies? Would be nice to get it resolved, and the hypotheses
involved are testable.
