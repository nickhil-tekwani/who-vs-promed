Hepatitis A Southeast Michigan Outbreak
---------------------------------------
Since the beginning of the outbreak in August 2016, public health response has included increased healthcare awareness efforts, public notification and education, and outreach with vaccination clinics for high-risk populations. No common sources of food, beverages, or drugs have been identified as a potential source of infection. Transmission appears to be through direct person-to-person spread and illicit drug use. Those with history of injection and non-injection drug use, homelessness or transient housing, and incarceration are thought to be at greater risk in this outbreak setting. Notably, this outbreak has had a high hospitalization rate.

In the last week, 29 more cases are reported with 1 more death. More than a 1/3 of the cases had neither homelessness nor substance abuse risk factors. It is possible that subclinical hepatitis A in food handlers may be responsible for some of the cases with no clear risk factors. Recommending hepatitis A vaccination among food handlers, as done in San Diego County, should be a consideration in Michigan. - Mod.LL
