Abstract
--------
Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry can cause severe economic damage and represent a public health threat. Development of efficient containment measures requires an understanding of how these influenza viruses are transmitted from one farm to the next. However, the actual mechanisms of inter-farm transmission are largely unknown. Dispersal of infectious material by wind has been suggested but never demonstrated as a possible cause of transmission between farms. Here, we provide statistical evidence that the direction of spread of avian influenza A(H7N7) is correlated with the direction of wind at date of infection. We find the direction of spread by reconstructing the transmission tree for a large outbreak in the Netherlands in 2003 using detailed genetic and epidemiological data. We conservatively estimate the contribution of a possible wind-mediated mechanism to the total amount of spread during this outbreak to be around 18 percent.

[The following excerpts are derived from the discussion chapter of the above "Epub ahead of print" paper:

"Wind-related spread of avian influenza has direct consequences for containment efforts. Farms emit vast quantities of particulate matter, which could well carry viable virus. Several systems, such as air scrubbers, water or oil sprinkling, changes in ventilation rate, and ionization systems have been shown to reduce dust concentrations and could be an efficient way to stop infectious particles from getting in or out. Alternative wind-related mechanisms cannot be excluded on the basis of our analysis. Wild birds or insects acting as vectors for the disease, flying preferentially in the direction of the wind, would explain our observations as well, but call for different control strategies. Furthermore, culling strategies may take into account the role of wind. 1st, care should be taken to ensure contaminated material does not get into the environment during culling activity. 2nd, wind direction should be taken into account when estimating the risk of infection for farms; the most efficient culling order will 1st target those farms that are at higher risk of infection and, when infected, will pose higher risks to other farms themselves. Thus, increased knowledge of which farms are at risk, provided by current and forecasted wind direction, allows for a more efficient culling strategy.

The type of analysis presented here may have potential to identify and quantify transmission mechanisms for other farm animal diseases. However, the resolution we obtained here, tracking individual transmissions, could only be achieved through the high percentage of farms sampled and high genetic diversity found. This resolution was necessary; an analysis looking solely at prevailing wind direction and farm coordinates would not have shown any significant effects. We, therefore, argue efforts should be made to gather genetic data for outbreaks of other infectious diseases as well. We do note, however, that the usefulness of such data will depend on the genetic diversity that accumulates over the course of the outbreak, which might be lower for other pathogens and depends on the methods used.

Identifying the mechanisms responsible for the transmission of livestock disease between farms is challenging: 1st, because data have to be collected during the outbreak, when the 1st priority will be control rather than research; and 2nd, because there are probably several different mechanisms at play, making their identification troublesome. The key to identifying transmission mechanisms is the reconstruction of detailed transmission networks made possible by the joint analysis of detailed genetic and epidemiological data."

It seems that the observations address spread of short distances, hundreds rather than thousands of meters.

The major 2003 epizootic in the Netherlands was caused by HPAI A(H7N7). For the entire text, references and figures, subscribers are referred to the full original paper at the source URL (subscription).
