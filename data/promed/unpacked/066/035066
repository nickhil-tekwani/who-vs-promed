News Update 21.3.97
It was reported on the radio news here half an hour ago that two elderly
people have died in Victoria, Australia and 22 other Victorians are sick from
salmonella (food poisoning). It is suspected that the illnesses occurred as
a result of eating corned beef and ham containing salmonella. Apparently 8
other people are also sufferring from the same salmonella related food
poisoning in Adelaide,South Australia and some products of ham and corned
beef are being re-called.

[Those of us who had the preveledge of being Ken Newell's students will
remember his class exercise based on his investigation, as a young PHLS
officer in ?1948, into the outbreak of salmonellosis in Pickering,
Yorkshire. The contamination was found to be due to tinned Argentine
bully-beef that after cooking and sealing had been cooled with water
straight out of the Rio Parana. A classic study. Martin Hugh-Jones,
