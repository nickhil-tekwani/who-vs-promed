Horse disease back in US after 20 years
---------------------------------------
A horse in Florida has contracted the rare parasitic disease equine
piroplasmosis [EP], last seen in the United States in 1988.

Blood and tissue testing of a 7-year-old gelding that had been
euthanized after a 3-week illness confirmed the presence of the
disease in the animal.

State officials immediately quarantined the Manatee County premises
in which the horse resided, as well as 2 adjacent properties
containing horses pending a determination of their status.

Florida Agriculture Commissioner Charles Bronson said an
investigation is being conducted by the State Veterinarian's Office
to determine the source of the disease and whether it has spread
beyond the immediate area of the animals.

Equine piroplasmosis is a bloodborne parasitic disease primarily
transmitted to horses by ticks or contaminated needles.

The disease was eradicated from Florida in the 1980s, and the tick
species believed to transmit EP in other countries have not been
identified in Florida in many years.

This disease is not directly contagious from one horse to another but
requires direct blood transfer. Human infection with equine
piroplasmosis is extremely rare.

Acutely affected horses can have depression, fever, anemia (decreased
red blood cells), jaundiced (yellow) mucous membranes, and low
platelet counts. EP can also cause horses to have roughened hair
coats, constipation, and colic. In its milder form, the disease
causes horses to appear weak and show lack of appetite. Some horses
become chronic carriers of the disease.

Veterinarians and horse owners in Florida have been asked to monitor
their horses carefully. Cases must be reported by law.

[The headlines of this article are misleading. Equine piroplasmosis
was diagnosed in Indiana in 2004.

Equine piroplasmosis results from infection by the protozoa _Babesia
caballi_ or _B. equi_ (phylum Apicomplexa). The 2 organisms may
infect an animal concurrently.

Equine piroplasmosis is a tick-borne protozoal infection of horses.
Piroplasmosis may be difficult to diagnose, as it can cause variable
and nonspecific clinical signs. The symptoms of this disease range
from acute fever, inappetence, and malaise, to anemia and jaundice,
sudden death, or chronic weight loss and poor exercise tolerance. The
disease may be fatal in up to 20 percent of previously unexposed
animals. The tick vectors exist in the United States, and epidemics
of piroplasmosis were seen in Florida in the 1960s.

The incubation period for _B. equi_ infections is 12 to 19 days, and
infections are more severe. For _B. caballi_ infections, it is 10 to 30 days.

The clinical signs of piroplasmosis are variable and often
nonspecific. In rare peracute cases, animals may be found dead or
dying. More often, piroplasmosis presents as an acute infection, with
a fever, inappetence, malaise, labored breathing, congestion of the
mucus membranes, and small, dry feces. Anemia, jaundice,
hemoglobinuria, sweating, petechial hemorrhages on the conjunctiva, a
swollen abdomen, and posterior weakness or swaying may also be seen.
Subacute cases may have a fever (sometimes intermittent),
inappetence, malaise, weight loss, signs of mild colic, and mild
edema of the distal limbs. The mucus membranes can be pink, pale
pink, or yellow, and may have petechiae or ecchymoses. In chronic
cases, common symptoms include mild inappetence, poor exercise
tolerance, weight loss, transient fevers, and an enlarged spleen
(palpable on rectal examination). Foals infected in utero are usually
weak at birth, and rapidly develop anemia and severe jaundice.

In acute cases, the animal is usually emaciated, jaundiced, and
anemic. The liver is typically enlarged and dark orange-brown. The
spleen is enlarged, and the kidneys are pale and flabby. Petechial
hemorrhages may be seen in the kidneys, and subepicardial and
subendocardial hemorrhages in the heart. There may also be edema in
the lungs and signs of pneumonia.

The differential diagnosis for piroplasmosis includes surra, equine
infectious anemia, dourine, African horse sickness, purpura
hemorrhagica, and various plant and chemical toxicities.

Equine piroplasmosis can be diagnosed by identification of the
organisms in Giemsa stained blood or organ smears. _B. caballi_
merozoites are joined at their posterior ends, while _B. equi_
merozoites are often connected in a tetrad or "Maltese cross."
Organisms can often be found in acute infections, but may be very
difficult to find in carrier animals. In carriers, thick blood films
can sometimes be helpful.

Because _Babesia_ organisms can be difficult to detect in carriers,
serology is often the diagnostic method of choice. Serologic tests
include complement fixation, indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA), and
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The IFA test can
distinguish between _B. equi_ and _B. cabali_.

Other methods of diagnosis include DNA probes, in vitro culture, and
the inoculation of a susceptible (preferably splenectomized) animal
with blood from a suspected carrier. In addition, pathogen-free
vector ticks can be fed on a suspect animal, and _Babesia_ identified
either in the tick or after the tick has transmitted the infection to
a susceptible animal.

Disinfectants and sanitation are not generally effective against the
spread of tick-borne infections. However, preventing the transfer of
blood from one animal to another is vital.
