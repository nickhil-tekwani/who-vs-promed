Since [19 Jun 2019], the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) has received confirmation of 3 additional anthrax cases in the area of Texas where anthrax is historically found. The 1st anthrax case of the year [2019] was confirmed in one captive antelope on a premises in Uvalde County on [19 Jun 2019]. Since that time, anthrax was confirmed in goats on a new Uvalde County premises on [24 Jun 2019], one Sutton County horse was confirmed to have anthrax on [3 Jul 2019], and cattle were confirmed to have anthrax on a separate Sutton County premises on [4 Jul 2019].

All of the premises have been placed under quarantine, and producers were advised on vaccinating exposed animals and the proper disposal of affected carcasses, as outlined by TAHC's rules. Typically, quarantines are lifted 10 days from vaccination or the last death loss.

"It is common to see an increase in anthrax cases after periods of wet, cool weather, followed by hot, dry conditions," said Dr. Andy Schwartz, TAHC Executive Director. "During these conditions, animals ingest the anthrax bacteria when they consume contaminated grass and hay, or inhale the spores. Outbreaks usually end when cooler weather arrives."

There is an effective anthrax vaccine available for use in susceptible livestock (includes, but is not limited to, swine, equine, sheep, goats, cattle, wildlife, etc.) in high-risk areas. TAHC encourages livestock owners to consult with a local veterinary practitioner and vaccinate livestock if owners live within the triangular area bound by the towns of Uvalde, Ozona and Eagle Pass. Producers may order anthrax vaccines directly from the manufacturer [or from your local feed store or veterinarian. - Mod.MHJ].

After exposure to [_Bacillus anthracis_ ("anthrax" is the disease, not the pathogen)], it usually takes 3 to 7 days for animals to show symptoms of anthrax. Once symptoms begin, death will usually occur within 48 hours. Acute fever followed by rapid death with bleeding from body openings are all common signs of anthrax in livestock. Owners of livestock and animals displaying symptoms consistent with anthrax or experiencing death of animals should contact a private veterinary practitioner or a TAHC official.

Producers are encouraged to follow basic sanitation precautions when handling affected livestock or carcasses. It is recommended to wear protective gloves and long-sleeved shirts and to wash thoroughly afterward to prevent accidental spread of the bacteria to people.

[We now have an additional outbreak in Uvalde County in goats and 2 occurrences in Sutton County in a horse and in an unstated number of cattle. Sutton County is 2 counties north of Uvalde, so it is not a matter of local spread. It is a new focus. To find Sutton County, go to https://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/texas_90.jpg. We have not seen the end of this series of anthrax outbreaks. We are in the middle and there will be more. All contaminated carcasses should be burnt, if possible. Use a burn pit, if you have one.

Vaccinating wildlife in an emergency is difficult, if not impossible, but make sure that any cattle or horses on your place are vaccinated. Do it when it is cool, not in the heat of the day, which makes it very stressful.

Anthrax is not very infectious for humans -- frankly, we are hard to infect (but easy to kill) -- but do get out of any bloody clothes and wash off your hands, arms, face and neck. A common face infection comes from scratching your face with an infective contaminated bloody finger and nail. Believe me, it happens. And thoroughly wash any insect bites. Biting flies will have been feeding on the carcass and you were just the next meal for a female tabanid fly.

Horses regularly get cutaneous anthrax from horseflies with contaminated mouthparts. So this horse is an indicator of other, probably unreported, outbreaks. Female tabanids can easily fly 5 to 7 km (3.1 to 4.3 mi), even 20 km (12.4 mi) on occasion. Information from ranchers in that part of Texas has a number of outbreaks northwest and south of Rocksprings. It is getting interesting. - Mod.MHJ
