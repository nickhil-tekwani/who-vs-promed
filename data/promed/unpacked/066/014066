Thousands of goats, sheep and cattle have died from a suspected lung infection [in Taita Taveta County, Coast region, Kenya], sparking fear that the outbreak could wipe out entire flocks. Some farmers accused the county livestock department of not intervening in time to prevent the deaths, as well as curb the spread of the infectious disease. According to reports from local farmers and the department, more than 5000 young goats, sheep and cattle have died in the past 2 weeks. The young ones of some wild animals have not been spared either. Farmers claimed the animals could have contracted the disease from livestock coming from outside the county. Their animals, they claimed, were not vaccinated against some infections. But Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries Executive Davis Mwangoma attributed the deaths to lung congestion caused by sudden temperature changes. Dr. Mwangoma said temperatures drop suddenly in the region when heavy rains follow a prolonged drought.

"The (sudden) differences in temperatures led to congested lungs in livestock leading to their deaths," said the executive yesterday. Mwangoma's explanation was also supported by the Veterinary Diseases Investigations department at Mariakani that conducted the research on the deaths of the livestock. Briefing The Standard, Mwangoma said bad weather conditions congested the animals' lungs, leading to the deaths. He refuted claims that the animals had died of a lung infection. Mwangoma spoke as farmers maintained that the livestock died of a lung disease.

Yesterday [6 Nov 2018], the executive clarified that most livestock were kept outside bomas [cow sheds], subjecting them to changing weather patterns. "Bad weather affected the livestock. We advise the farmers to ensure that just before the rains start, goats and sheep need to be sheltered to avert deaths," said Mwangoma. But the farmers told off the executive and accused him of misleading locals about the livestock deaths. "The county administration is yet to conduct vaccination against diseases in the region. We are blaming it on lung disease that has left a heavy toll in the region," said a farmer identified as Adan, who said [he] lost more than 700 livestock. Records indicate that the Kasigau location had lost more than 1000 goats and sheep.

Farmers said the worst-hit areas include ranches bordering the Tsavo National Park and settlement areas. "A lung disease is killing our animals," claimed Kishagha Dio from Kasigau in Voi. The farmers claimed that small game like dik-diks had not been spared. A recent drought management report, from the National Drought Management Authority, noted that during drought, animals grew thin and their health deteriorated due to inadequate pasture, water and fodder.

[A previous report from the same source, dated 31 Oct 2018, informed that "Hundreds of livestock and wildlife have died following heavy rains in Taita Taveta County. Farmers yesterday said the worst-hit areas were ranches and smaller settlement areas bordering the Tsavo National Park." Most deaths involved young goats; see https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2001301102/more-than-200-livestock-die-mysterious.

From the 2 reports, the following summarised information could be derived:

1. The event started 2 to 3 weeks ago, following heavy rains in the affected region.
2. Livestock (cattle, sheep and goats) as well as wild ruminants (dik-dik, small antelopes in the genus _Madoqua_) were affected.
3. Within a week, the estimated number of deaths rose from hundreds to thousands (the figure 5000 is mentioned).
4. Juvenile animals (kids, lambs, calves and young antelopes) were the main victims, particularly in caprines.
5. The worst hit areas are ranches and smaller settlement areas bordering the Tsavo National Park.
6. The farmers suspected lung infection; there is no additional evidence for this observation, nor information on other clinical signs, including the duration of disease preceding death, nor gross pathology findings.
7. The vaccination history of the adult animals is not available. The farmers complained that their animals "had not been vaccinated." The event involves primarily juveniles; have the farmers referred to unvaccinated young stock?
8. The attribution of mass mortality, in offspring of several animal species, to "changing weather patterns" is less likely than an infectious agent. Mass acute mortality in goat herds exposed to sudden cold rain has been anecdotally recorded in the past.

The differential diagnosis should include Rift valley fever (RVF), an acute, vector-borne, zoonotic viral disease affecting primarily juvenile ruminants, with possible very high mortality rates in the youngest, and causing abortions. Typically, epizootics of RVF follow heavy rains, which are known to precede the emergence of RVF virus-infected mosquito's larvae.

During 2018, RVF has hit the region between May and September. Livestock were reportedly affected in Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda and South Sudan. In addition, human infections with the disease were observed in all these countries, except for Rwanda. Last outbreaks in livestock occurred in September in Lyantode district in Uganda (20180907.6014484). The 2018 reported outbreaks in animals are presented in OIE's map at https://tinyurl.com/y7t3pv4o (click on the East African cluster, zoom in). The location of Taita Taveta is available at https://tinyurl.com/y8z858cw.

Early forecasts of RVF emergence may enable timely vaccination of livestock; vaccination during an epizootic is not recommended. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) maintains continuously and persistently an RVF monitoring/early warning system, taking into consideration several factors, including climatic analyses and forecasts, which, combined, contribute to the production of predictions addressing the odds of RVF outbreaks in eastern and western Africa. RVF prediction is also addressed by the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). Based on information of recent significant rainfall and vegetation anomalies, it was concluded that increased suitable environmental conditions for RVF vector amplification may have been maintained in south/east Kenya and southern Sudan. Taita Taveta is one of the locations with persistent heavy rains over the past 6 months, representing a major hotspot for RVF vector amplification and potential RVF epizootic.

FAO is assisted by the ARS (USDA) in its RVF prediction. Subscribers may wish to visit the map "RVF Potential October 2018" in the section "4. NDVI Anomalies and RVF Risk Map" at https://www.ars.usda.gov/southeast-area/gainesville-fl/center-for-medical-agricultural-and-veterinary-entomology/docs/rvf_monthlyupdates/. FAO's new RVF Surveillance Manual is available at http://www.fao.org/3/i8475en/I8475EN.pdf.

There is no information on RVF diagnosed/suspected in humans in the region. Results of tests applied in samples obtained from animals are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS
