Europe prepares for possible whooping cough epidemic:
Public health officials across Europe are preparing for a continent-wide
epidemic of whooping cough following an outbreak in the Netherlands that is
resistant to a leading vaccine. The new strain of the infectious disease
is a mutation of the bacterium Bordetela pertussis that attacks mainly
children but can also hit adults. Eighty-nine percent of the Dutch
children who contracted it had been vaccinated. "The mutation appeared in
the early 1980s, but now occurs in 90 percent of circulating strains," Dr
Johannes Schellekens of the Dutch National Institute of Public Health told
New Scientist magazine on Thursday.
Whooping cough, a disease of the mucous membrane lining the air passages,
causes attacks of convulsive coughing and often vomiting. It is more
prevalent in girls than boys and usually occurs between the ages of one and
four. Nearly 3,000 cases have already been reported in the Netherlands,
compared to just 321 in 1995. Danish health officials have treated 179
children so far, more than double last year's figure. The same mutation has
already been spotted in Finland, Italy, Germany, France and possibly
Belgium. The likelihood of the mutant strain of the disease spreading
across the continent will depend on which type of vaccine a country uses.
The whole cell vaccine used by the Dutch has been ineffective. But other
vaccines in England and Finland, which give immunity to pertactin and other
proteins, will help sufferers fight the disease. "In such cases the
mutation may cause a smaller or later epidemic," said Schellekens. During
the last epidemic in Britain in the late 1970s, 102,500 cases were
reported, including 36 deaths.
