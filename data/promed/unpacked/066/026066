I am not a health care professional but worked 6 years in the engineering
department. for a hospital in south Florida. We experienced outbreaks such
as some form of _Aspergillus_ sp. It may have been due to construction
where an older section was torn down while the hospital was still open. The
plastic seals between the construction areas and the existing hospital was
insufficient and we wound up triple sealing the penetrations, encouraged
supervisors to stop all employees from entering the existing hospital, all
employees were to wear shoe coverings, replace them when both entering and
leaving different areas.

Also, the HEPA air filters were changed every 2 months until all
construction was completed. Also fresh air intakes to the affected area
were in taking contaminants from the construction area from on the roof. We
had to rearrange the fresh air intakes away from the construction zone.

Resources include:
1. University of Minnesota, Environmental Health and Safety at
. At this website, under resources, see Indoor Air
Quality - HVAC System Decontamination. Andrew Streifel, the Hospital
Environmentalist at the University of Minnesota is an expert consultant in
air quality and infection control issues related to hospital
construction, demolition and renovation whom our institution used for a
major demolition project. From working with him and reading through your
situation, I feel he may be able to assist you in preventing further
occurrences. He can be reached at 612-626-5804.
2. The American Institute of Architects Academy of Architecture for Health
with assistance from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
publishes Guidelines for Design and Construction of Hospital and Health
Care Facilities that has ventilation requirements and filter efficiencies
listed. Their web site is and their publication is
available for purchase to non-members.
3. The Association for Professionals in Infection Control and
Epidemiology, Inc. (APIC) includes the AIA guidelines plus additional
information related OR ventilation and filter requirements in Chapters 95,
103 and 104 of their publication Infection Control and Applied
Epidemiology, Principles and Practice (1996). In the case of
_Aspergillus_ sp. surgical infections, they stress that location of air
intakes, proper equipment functioning i.e fans and filter mechanisms and
proper equipment maintenance need to be investigated. Their website is
. They also make the statement that there are no published
studies which relate ventilation parameters to post operative wound
infections.
4. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning
Engineers' international headquarters can be reached at 404-636-8400.
They may be able to further assist you.

Hopefully, these resources can help you. At some point, it would be very
educational if you could share the source/cause of introduction of this
organism into your surgery.

The _Aspergillus_ sp. could be growing on or in the walls due to water
leaks into the operating rooms. If this were the case, decontamination and
ventilation would not help. The American Society of heating, refrigerating
and air-conditioning engineers <http://www.ashrae.org/> may have
information which might be useful in operating rooms.

I doubt that you will find many national regulations or standards for
microbial contamination levels in operating rooms, as opposed to guidelines
on airflow and exchange rates per se. Industrial clean-rooms (and
operating rooms similarly outfitted with HEPA laminar airflow HVAC systems)
do have specified microbial density specifications (e.g. "class 100"
environments). Here are some pertinent references:
PARADIGM Database Search, 21 May 98:
1. Lidwell OM, Richards IDG, Polakoff S. Comparison of 3 Ventilating
Systems in an Operating Room. J HYG CAMB 1967;65:193-205.
Downflow displacement, moderate-velocity turbulent & low-velocity turbulent
systems compared with culture & tracer (22-28 air changes/hr). In all,
staff activity &
thermal currents correlated with bioloads more so than system. 8/10
surgical wounds contaminated with S. aureus were of patient origin, 1 from
active staff disperser, 1
from unidentified source. Air volume more important than diffuser type;
airflow must be >10'/min to overcome thermal currents. 6SWI/391 operations;
recommends that except for exceptional circumstances, major emphasis should
be on preventing bacterial dispersal at source(s) rather than by
ventilation system controls.
2. Smith C. Hospital Operating Theatre Environment & The Assessment of
Filters for Use in Associated Ventilating Plants. ANN OCCUP HYG
1975;17:303-14.
Cites work of Blowers, Lidwell & Williams. Standards, test protocols &
sample results for RAF hospitals given. Temperature, relative humidity &
pressurization direction same as Hill-Burton specifications; filtration
efficiency for required 2 filters differs; data provided re: desired level
of bacterial contamination & pressures
required for effective barriers.
3. American Institute of Architects Committee on Architecture for Health
Guidelines for Construction and Equipment of Hospital and Medical
Facilities, 1992-93. American Institute of Architects Press.
Design criteria, replacing the Hill-Burton Act minimum requirements
document, provides specifications for various aspects of building design
and services. SEE ALSO ASHRAE Heating Ventilation and Air-Condition
Handbook (Chapter 7) re: air handling systems.
---COPYRIGHT, APPLIED EPIDEMIOLOGY---
PARADIGM contains other descriptive studies of bioloads in operating rooms,
if that would be of interest, and infection rates in laminar flow vs.
conventional ORs, as well as one investigative report of _Aspergillus
fumigatus_ sternal wound infections following open heart surgery (not
attributed to an environmental source). What was the source of your
problem? Lack of air duct and grille maintenance, water-damaged acoustical
tiles, condition of air intake grilles and filters, and dusty supplies come
to mind.
