Anthrax alert
-------------
Health services have identified cases of anthrax in the village of Koku-Tamberma (Prefecture of Keran, Kara Region). According to information gathered on site, they already deplore the death of two people and 15 cattle.

The ministers of agriculture, Messan Ewovor, and health, Charles Agba Condi, were keen to reassure the public by publishing a statement Monday [20 Feb 2012] indicating that "appropriate provisions such as vaccination of cattle around homes and immediate management of human patients have already been implemented to control the epidemic and save human lives."

The authorities are asking the people of this region of Togo to refrain from consuming meat from dead animals.

[Describing these events as an epidemic is a bit early based on the fact that there have only been 2 human deaths and 15 cattle lost. Either this is ministerial exaggeration or there is more going on than we are aware of.

Anthrax is regularly seen in cattle and sometimes reported in sheep and goats in Togo, along with human cases. This is because there are 'champs maudit' (accursed fields) in the regions of Savanes and Kara, and control is inconstant. In spite of the high risk of this disease in Togo, this is only our 2nd report. Anthrax is a significant livestock threat in West Africa.
