Livestock are dying by the dozens southwest of Saskatoon because of
blue-green algae flourishing in the water.
Ranchers in the Wiseton and Dinsmore area are scrambling to deal with
the problem.
Ivan Thomson said about 40 of his bison have died from drinking
contaminated water, with the 1st fatality occurring about 2 weeks ago.
It's primarily the breeding bulls and the heavier milking females
that are dying, he said. "They're more active, so their systems
require more moisture. They drink more water, then bang," he said.
Thomson has moved his livestock to different pastures, but the
blue-green algae keep popping up.
Some of his bison have died within 30 minutes of ingesting the water
-- sometimes while they're still standing in a body of water -- while
others have lived nearly 2 days after, he said.
"If the blue-green algae doesn't get at them instantly, then the
toxins accumulate in their liver."
Blue-green algae have been choking lakes in many parts of Canada this
year [2007].
The algae are microscopic organisms that, in the right conditions,
can proliferate and form a bloom, emitting toxins that are a
potential health hazard for humans and animals.
The blue-green algae have been found in lakes in Saskatchewan,
Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec.
After losing 14 cows and 2 bulls, southern Saskatchewan livestock
producer Donn Facca began treating his water, trying to avert further
deaths. "It turns into a pretty big hurt," he said of the economic impact.
Farmers are blaming the excessive blue-green algae growth on wet
weather in July followed by a wave of extreme heat.
At the end of July 2007, the province issued a warning about
blue-green algae blooms. It said these can occur during calm, hot
weather in areas of lakes and reservoirs with shallow, slow moving or
still water that is rich in nutrients, and can last up to 3 weeks.
"It used to be pleasurable to go out in the pastures. Now I don't
know what I'll find."

Toxic algae can produce a number of different toxins, some capable of
killing animals within a very short time. Toxic blooms should be
taken seriously and public health warning heeded.
Cyanobacteria is the scientific name for blue-green algae, or "pond
scum." The 1st recognized species were blue-green in color, which is
how the algae got their name. Species identified since range in color
from olive-green to red.
Cyanobacteria form in shallow, warm, slow-moving or still water. They
are made up of cells, which can house poisons called cyanobacterial
toxins. A mass of cyanobacteria in a body of water is called a bloom.
When this mass rises to the surface of the water, it is known as
surface scum or a surface water bloom. Although we don't know the
extent to which cyanobacterial blooms occur across Canada, we do know
they mostly appear in the hot summer months and are quite prevalent
in the prairies.
Cyanobacterial toxins are the naturally produced poisons stored in
the cells of certain species of cyanobacteria. These toxins fall into
various categories. Some are known to attack the liver (hepatotoxins)
or the nervous system (neurotoxins); others simply irritate the skin.
These toxins are usually released into water when the cells rupture or die.
One group of toxins produced and released by cyanobacteria are called
microcystins because they were isolated from a cyanobacterium called
_Microcystis aeruginosa_. Microcystins are the most common of the
cyanobacterial toxins found in water, as well as being the ones most
often responsible for poisoning animals and humans who come into
contact with toxic blooms. Microcystins are extremely stable in water
because of their chemical structure, which means they can survive in
both warm and cold water and can tolerate radical changes in water
chemistry, including pH. So far, scientists have found about 50
different kinds of microcystins. One of them, microcystin-LR, appears
to be one of the microcystins most commonly found in water supplies
around the world.
