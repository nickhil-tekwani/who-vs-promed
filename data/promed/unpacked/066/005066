---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On 6 Sep 2021, RASVE (Red de Alerta Sanitaria Veterinaria) reported a single clinical case of anthrax (_Bacillus anthracis_) in a mare in Navalvillar de Pela, Extremadura, Spain. The mare had been admitted to the Veterinary Hospital (UEX) on 28 Aug 2021, showing signs of colic, tachycardia, tachypnoea, and fever and died several hours later. Necropsy was carried out, and samples from organs were cultured at the Microbiology Service of the hospital, with positive pure growth in all samples. The strain was then sent to VISAVET Health Surveillance Centre (UCM, Madrid), where a positive PCR to _Bacillus anthracis_ and its virulence plasmids PXO1 and PXO2 was notified as of 3 Sep 2021; the positive result was later confirmed by the national reference laboratory, and the outbreak was reported to the OIE.

As of 1 Oct 2021, 17 outbreaks of anthrax have been reported in premises around the area with at least 3 dead horses, 46 dead cows, and 5 dead pigs reported. A recent outbreak notified on 24 Sep 2021 in Merida is more than 80 km [50 mi] away from the initial case. There have been 2 human cases of anthrax (cutaneous form) confirmed in these outbreaks: a veterinary surgeon who had carried out a necropsy, and the owner from an affected horse. The staff at the Veterinary Hospital (where no human cases have been reported) was immediately placed into isolation after the notification of the initial case, and preventive treatment was carried out. A previous outbreak in Ciudad Real (Castilla La Mancha, Spain) where a cow died had been reported on 1 Sep 2021; at this stage, this outbreak is presumed to be unrelated to the outbreaks in Extremadura. Epidemiological surveys are ongoing to confirm the cause for the exceptional spread of the disease. Control measures, including vaccination of all susceptible animals, isolation of affected premises, and appropriate disposal of carcasses were put in place from the 1st notification and are ongoing.

[This report fills in some details missing from the previous official report to OIE. The latter with 6 outbreaks lacked the human and pig cases, and many dead cows were missing in all 17 outbreaks. This happens when formal reports depend on samples submitted for laboratory confirmation and not events as seen in the field. There is an interesting map in the source article showing that the outbreaks were scattered. We look forward to seeing the results of their epidemiologic investigations and surveys. I suspect that it will be found that tabanid flies were involved in the secondary spread from the primary outbreak. But there will be surprises. - Mod.MHJ
