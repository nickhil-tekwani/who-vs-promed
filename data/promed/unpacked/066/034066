While the Odisha government has intensified efforts to contain the suspected outbreak of anthrax in a village of Angul district, health officials are facing stiff resistance from the affected people over hospitalising them for treatment.

Around 16 persons from Suleipal village were rushed to the SCB Medical College and Hospital [in Cuttack] on Tuesday [12 Jun 2013] and more than 10 others have been detected with signs and symptoms of the infection. However, they were not ready to be taken to the hospital, despite coaxing from the health officials.

"The officials are faced with strong resistance from the affected people, who termed the wounds minor and said did not require treatment. While the officials tried to prevail over them, many of them fled the village. We are, however, trying to explain the dangers (the disease could cause) and admit the afflicted to the hospital," ADMO [additional district medical officer] Dr Ganesh Das said.

The district administration, along with the State Health Department and Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services (AHVS) Department, has launched a comprehensive screening of both the human and animal population in the region. A ring zone has been formed, covering all habitations along a 10-km [6 mi] radius of the affected Suleipal village.

"Ring vaccination of all livestock across the 10-km radius has commenced. The situation is being constantly monitored," sources said.

The district administration along with State Health Department and the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services (AHVS) Department has launched a comprehensive screening of both human and animal population in region. A ring zone has been formed covering all habitations along a 10 km [6 mi] radius of the affected Suleipal village. While a special public health team has started screening people, the veterinary wing has rushed in scientists from Animal Disease Research Institute (ADRI) [in Cuttack] to determine if the outbreak is due to anthrax and also take emergency steps to contain the spread.

"Ring vaccination of all livestock across the 10 km radius has commenced. Teams have fanned out to the villages for collecting samples of soil as well as serum and swab from the animals. The situation is being constantly monitored", Joint Director, AHVS Department, Dr ES Patra said. The outbreak has posed questions for experts as Angul district has no history of anthrax incidence. There have, though, been animal deaths under suspicious circumstances in the recent days, mostly among goats. And the affected population is from a particular community that not only consumes meat of dead animals but also handles skin and leather for its vocation of drum-making.

Sources said not all affected people consumed meat of dead goats, which alludes to the possibility of contracting infection by handling infected skin or coming into contact with spores in soil. Anthrax spores can survive for decades and even a century. "The spores, which might have been lying dormant in soil for long, could have surfaced now and infected animals during movement. 10 teams of veterinary officials have been formed for screening of animals. An awareness campaign has been launched to educate people", chief district veterinary officer, Angul, Dr Sachidananda Patnaik said.
