Japan Extends Import Rules Deadline
------------------------------------
Japan is to delay the deadline for demanding country of origin labelling on
US beef exports until 1 Sep 2003. The action was due to take effect on 1
Jul 2003, but now the Japanese authorities have delayed the action
following representations by the USDA.
Japan had decided to impose the new import standards in the wake of the
discovery of a case of BSE in Canada. Japan says it wants to be certain
that US exports are of US origin and do not come from Canada.
The United States, Japan and more than 20 other countries banned Canadian
beef after an Alberta bull (sic; should be cow) tested positive on 20 May
2003 for BSE.
South Korea, the third largest importer of US beef, is also considering
changes to its import standards because of the Canadian BSE case.
US Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman said last week: "We are continuing to
work diligently to address the request from Japan and Korea to discuss
changes in their import standards as a result of the discovery of a single
case of BSE recently reported in Canada.
"Our technical experts will be participating in tri-lateral meetings with
Canada and Japan to examine the results of the Canadian investigation and
explore additional science-based safeguards.
Japan and Korea are important markets for U.S. beef. USDA and FDA have
hosted technical delegations from these 2 countries and we have dispatched
technical teams to those countries to improve their understanding of the
BSE safeguard measures in place in the United States.
This matter is of utmost priority and we will continue to maintain
communication at all levels to assure that this issue is resolved in an
acceptable manner using the best available science."

Report on actions taken by Canada in response to the confirmation of an
indigenous case of BSE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The team consisting of Prof. U. Kihm (Switzerland), Prof. W. Hueston (USA)
and Dr. D. Heim (Switzerland) convened in Ottawa on 7-9 Jun 2003.
Additional input by phone and e-mail was available from Dr. S. MacDiarmid
in New Zealand. The team was provided an overview of the epidemiological
investigation, the actions taken to date, and the scope of options and
measures being considered to adjust domestic policies to address the new
reality that exists in Canada and within the broader North American context.
The team wishes to clearly acknowledge the openness, full disclosure and
access to personnel provided by the Canadian authorities to our team, the
international community and the public. The approach to sharing of
information and communication demonstrated by Canada is a model to be emulated.
1. Investigation to date
The team is impressed with the comprehensive scope, level of analysis and
thoroughness of the investigation to date. In a very short time Canadian
experts have collected and assessed a level of information that exceeds the
investigations done in most other BSE-affected countries. This serves as a
testament to the competence, capacity and dedication of effort of Canadian
officials.
The investigation has looked at both the circumstances surrounding the
index case of BSE and the macro-epidemiological risk factors which have
contributed to the expression and detection of the first indigenous case in
North America. It is important to acknowledge that measures previously in
place achieved their designed outcome as demonstrated by the identification
of the positive animal in a manner which precluded its entry into the human
food chain. Furthermore, the various risk management measures implemented
by Canada over a number of years have reduced the risks of spread and
amplification of the disease. The team applauds the proactive examination
of industry characteristics (rendering industry, feed formulation, feeding
and husbandry practices on farm and the surveillance activities) that is
essential to a full understanding of the complex interrelationships of
factors associated with the disease. The Canadian regulators, veterinary
profession and livestock industries have learned in a demonstrable way from
the experiences of other countries which have been affected by BSE, and
have applied that knowledge beneficially.
2. Actions Arising From the Investigation
The Canadian experts have established epidemiological evidence that
supports the probability that the expression of BSE in the case animal was
associated with exposure to infective material through the feeding system
at some point early in the life of the animal.
Prior to the implementation of the feed ban in 1997, opportunities existed
for animals in the source herd to have been legally fed rations containing
ruminant MBM [meat & bone meal]. It cannot be determined whether the
contaminated MBM was of imported or domestic origin. Neither can past
exposure of other cattle to contaminated feed be discounted. The
possibility that products were derived from the positive cow, and the
possibility that other infected cattle in the late stages of incubation are
present in Canadian herds, lead to the conclusion that the adoption of
additional measures to reduce or eliminate future exposure are warranted.
It can reasonably be assumed based on the collective experience of other
countries that adjustments must be undertaken promptly to address the
possibility that other animals may have been exposed and are incubating the
disease.
A significant factor which affected the scope of the investigation, and the
extensive culling of animals which resulted, was the limitation imposed by
the lack of a mandatory animal identification program in existence prior to
2001. This necessitated the extended application of all available
scientific methods and investigative tools in an effort to compensate for
the absence of a traceability system dating back 7 years.
Given the quality and extent of information gathered to date, the team
considers it appropriate for the active investigation and the culling
activities to be concluded and the focus redirected to short and mid term
policy adjustments which would serve to address the changed North American
dynamic.
Further investigation of feed and exposure cohorts, along with the
disposition of the MBM created from the index cow, are unlikely to yield
further insights nor contribute in a meaningful way to protection of public
or animal health and should be discontinued.
The investigations have clearly identified the potential for past exposure
and clearly established the need to address the risk that BSE is present in
the Canadian herd and beyond.
The review team recognised that the initial response followed established
veterinary practice for disease control for contagious diseases. However,
in light of the consensus that BSE is not a contagious disease, this
approach should be reconsidered, and measures to prevent exposure through
contaminated feed should be implemented and controlled on a national level.
3. Future policy actions
Policy actions being considered by Canada must achieve the following
objectives:
- reduce public health risk for consumer protection
- further limit recycling and amplification of the agent
- establish a benchmark for the effectiveness of measures through surveillance
- prevent any inadvertent introduction of BSE from abroad in the future
- contribute to the prevention of the spread of the epidemic worldwide
To achieve these objectives, a system of complementary barriers, and
implementation of all measures on the national level, is necessary.
These goals cannot be successfully achieved by government alone; their
implementation requires a shared commitment and action on the part of
national and provincial governments, producers, consumers, industry, and
veterinary professionals. Extensive national coordination and cooperation
is imperative.
The team recommends that the following measures are the ones which should
be given highest priority for adoption. Other measures may be adopted at a
later time, and a periodic re-assessment of the measures is advisable.
Depending on the evolution of the BSE situation in Canada, and North
America as a whole, modification of some of these measures may be appropriate.
4. Prohibition of Specified Risk Materials (SRM)
Implementation of an SRM ban is the most critical and valuable central
measure for public health protection and food safety and is fully endorsed
by the review team. An SRM ban would also reduce the risk of infectivity in
animal feed.
A plan for the safe removal, collection and destruction of the SRM should
be immediately developed. Measures to ensure that SRM are not included in
human food and animal feed should be implemented, enforced and audited for
compliance.
The list of material considered as SRM and the age of animals included must
be based on science to ensure that potentially infected material does not
enter the feed and food chains. The list of SRM must be based on knowledge
derived from the extensive studies on cattle, which have demonstrated that
BSE infectivity may be present in brain, spinal cord, trigeminal ganglia,
dorsal root ganglia, terminal ileum, eyes, and tonsils. The age of the
cattle included in the ban should be determined by science and practical
aspects of implementation must also be considered. The timely and full
national implementation of this measure should be a priority. Its adoption
will greatly influence the relative scope of other measures.
Additional measures to avoid contamination with SRM at slaughter and during
processing should be considered (e.g. stunning techniques).
5. Advanced Meat Recovery/Mechanically Recovered Meat
In advanced Meat Recovery (AMR) procedures and Mechanically Recovered Meat
(MRM) systems must be implemented to exclude raw materials containing
potentially infectious tissues (skull, vertebral column).
6. Control of SRM, ARM and MRM ban
To insure that no central nervous tissue is included in food, especially
that derived from AMR and MRM, sampling and testing programs should be
adopted. These programs should be implemented on a test-and-hold basis and
should include destruction of any contaminated products to exclude its use
in the human or animal food chain.
7.Surveillance
Adjustments to surveillance approaches are warranted in the new environment
in order to determine the current prevalence and to judge the effectiveness
of measures implemented over time.
The review team supports the proposal for an increased targeted
surveillance program to be implemented at the national level. This program
should focus on the highest risk populations of adult fallen stock and dead
stock, cattle demonstrating clinical signs compatible with BSE and downer
cattle. Ideally all cattle of these high risk populations should be tested.
Additional measures are recommended to assure that high risk cattle are not
entering the food chain by other routes.
Furthermore, in accordance with the investigations carried out by the
Canadian experts, specific geographical and temporal risk groups within the
national cattle population have been identified. Targeted surveillance
activities to encompass this cohort of animals are also encouraged.
8. Feed Restrictions
The review team strongly endorses the exclusion of Specified Risk Materials
from the feed chain as an effective means to reduce infectivity in meat and
bone meal (MBM). The difficulty in distinguishing ruminant derived MBM from
other mammalian and poultry derived MBM must be considered. Inclusion of
any ruminant-derived MBM in ruminant feed rations should be avoided and
opportunities for possible cross contamination eliminated. Whether this can
be guaranteed by introduction of a mammalian MBM ban to ruminants or other
specific measures has to be evaluated.
For risk reduction at the farm level where multiple species are raised, a
system should be implemented that avoids possible cross feeding of rations
containing ruminant MBM among species. Such an on-farm system would have to
be closely audited for compliance and the resource implications of adequate
monitoring may make prohibition a more practicable measure.
9. Identification Preservation and Traceability Systems
The current investigation reinforces the need for continuous investment,
improvement and extension of the cattle identification system, initiated 3
years ago.
10. Import policies
Import policies should be subject to ongoing review to address the
continued global risks and to ensure that products entering the country
fully meet the same stringent standards for health protection prescribed
domestically. Import controls must be rigorous enough to avoid introducing
additional infectivity into the animal feed system using additional
controls both in the country of origin and post entry (e.g. testing of
fishmeal and poultry meal for possible contamination or inclusion of
mammalian MBM).
11. Export
Export policy and regulations should be re-assessed to provide all
reasonable assurances that BSE is not further spread.
12. Education
Disease awareness among producers, veterinarians, and personnel from the
feed and slaughter industries and other related industries is critical for
effective implementation and compliance with import requirements, feed
restrictions, SRM control and surveillance as well as for the protection of
animal feeds and human foods. Universities have a special obligation to
emphasize key information on BSE diagnosis, prevention and control.
13. Risk communication
The Canadian authorities should continue their excellent practice of
involving concerned parties in the identification of risk factors,
assessment of risk and discussion of the most appropriate risk management
approaches. Equally important is continuing the close collaboration with
public health officials to keep risks to public health in perspective.
Efforts to ensure a broad consumer understanding of the nature of the
disease and the safety of consuming muscle meat is required to address
misconceptions that have been associated with the disease in the past.
14. Future case investigations
The first BSE-case in Canada was intensively investigated and extensive
information gathered. Based on experience in other BSE-affected countries,
future investigations can be conducted on a more restricted basis because
there is limited additional information to be gained.
15. Culling policy
Based on the fact that BSE is not a contagious disease, culling decisions
can be postponed until after the epidemiological investigation has been
finalised, as long as entry of the animals into the food chain is
temporarily prohibited.
A culling policy consistent with the following recommendations derived from
the recently adopted BSE chapter of the OIE International Animal Health
Code is recommended. This policy includes culling of:
- progeny (of affected females) born within 2 years prior to, and after
clinical onset of the disease, if still alive, and
- all cattle which during their first year of life were reared with the
affected animal during the first year of its life and which investigation
showed consumed the same potentially contaminated feed during that period, or
- where the results of an investigation are inconclusive, all cattle born
in the same herd as, and within 12 months of the birth of the affected animal.
16. Enforcement (control of implementation)
All measures implemented through the revised policies should have clear and
well understood performance indicators and should be supported with
intensive compliance and verification activities. Such compliance
activities should extend beyond document verification and include
operational spot checks and laboratory analysis where applicable. The
provincial controls for implementation should be supervised by a central
authority in order to assure a harmonized approach.
Equally important is that all measures must be truly national in scope and
implementation must be to a common standard across all levels of jurisdiction.
17. Infrastructure
A good veterinary infrastructure including diagnostic laboratories is
essential to support disease investigations, surveillance systems,
epidemiological analyses and policy considerations. The response to the
case of BSE in Canada required redirection of a significant portion of
their national capability. Infrastructure enhancements will be necessary to
sustain the BSE response as well as maintain other national animal health
priorities.

International mad cow report calls for ban on animal nerve tissues in feed
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
EDMONTON: Canada must immediately ban all animal tissues where mad cow
disease can be found, such as the skull and vertebral column, to keep
infection from entering the food chain, says a team of international experts.
The ban would mean such products, which are already kept out of the human
food chain, could no longer be used in any animal feed products. "Full
national implementation of this measure should be a priority," reads the
report. Other recommended measures include a review of animal feed
restrictions, stronger tracking and tracing systems, better disease testing
and surveillance and education to improve awareness among producers,
veterinarians and the public.
An infected cow was found in northwestern Alberta in mid-May [2003],
prompting a massive investigation and the closing of the Canada-U.S. border
to Canadian cattle and beef products.
The experts went to Ottawa in early June [2003] on the invitation of the
Canadian Food Inspection Agency. They said in their report, released late
Thursday, they were impressed with the scope, analysis and thoroughness of
the agency's investigation.
The panel said animal tissues known as Specified Risk Materials, or SRMs,
must be removed from all products destined for consumption.
Materials where bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, may be present
are the brain, spinal cord, trigeminal ganglia, dorsal root ganglia,
terminal ileum, eye, and tonsils. Such materials have been banned from use
in cattle feed since 1997, but have been allowed as feed for non-ruminants
such as chickens and hogs. That must all change, says the report.
"A plan for the safe removal, collection and destruction of the SRM should
be immediately developed."
Earlier, Canadian experts pointed to the probability that the infected cow
had been legally fed ruminant meat and bone meal before it was banned in 1997.
Consequently major adjustments are needed, say the experts, since there's
"the possibility that other animals may have been exposed and are
incubating the disease." To ensure that no infected material makes its way
into the food chain, the experts recommend a countrywide surveillance
program to test all cattle that show advanced signs of BSE as well as all
dead stock. The Alberta cow was so sick it could no longer stand.
In an interview last month, British expert Malcolm Ferguson-Smith, who was
part of an inquiry that examined the spread of mad cow disease in the
United Kingdom, said Canada should go one step further and ban all cattle
remains from being processed into animal feed.
Health Minister Anne McLellan and Agriculture Minister Lyle Vanclief said
in a news release late Thursday that the federal government will respond
quickly to the recommendations.
"Canada's food supply continues to be safe," McLellan said.
"Our number-one priority is the health and safety of Canadians. Health
Canada will build on the measures already in place to protect public health
and safety."
Vanclief said the team noted the quality of the Canadian investigation into
the case and the effectiveness of measures already in place in Canada to
protect the public.
"We agree with the need for early action on SRMs and are committed to
introducing changes as quickly as possible," he said in the release.
Sue Robertson, media relations officer with the CFIA, said she didn't know
how long it would be before Ottawa passed any of the recommendations.
"We still have to bring the amendments to Parliament. . . Like any policy
there's still a parliamentary procedure that has to be followed."
No other officials from the agency were available for comment Thursday night.
Earlier in the day, a federal cabinet minister said Canada's mad cow
problem will increasingly become a U.S. problem.
Ralph Goodale, who is responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, said the
United States will have to comply with what the panel recommends to Canada,
and will have to move quickly or find itself at a disadvantage. That's
because the industries in the two countries are so closely integrated.
"Customers off the continent tend to look at this as continental supply,"
said Goodale, who was in Washington.
"Even if we start off having the problem, we in fact could be so proactive
in resolving it, that when after the fact one compares the Canadian regime
to the American regime, many countries around the world will find the
Canadian regime more advanced," he said.
Saskatchewan Agricultural Minister Clay Serby hadn't examined the report
closely but said its key recommendations would likely help reopen the trade
border with the U.S.
"The question will really be, how significant are the conditions that are
tied to the report and what actual commitments do we need to make?" said
Serby. 2 of the 18 farms that were quarantined in the Prairies were in
Saskatchewan - one of them being the suspected birthplace of the infected
cow. Agricultural ministers, he said, were expected to discuss the report
during a conference call Friday morning.
The report could provide the leverage needed by the provinces to seek
additional resources from the federal government for the new Agriculture
Policy Framework, he added.
"We've always said that we believe that we have to increase the resources
that we have within the system to ensure that we have safe food."
The 4-person panel from the United States, Switzerland and New Zealand,
reviewed a sweeping investigation by the agency and looked at what measures
were taken to ensure a safe beef supply since mad cow disease was found in
a single Alberta breeder cow.
In addition to the United States, several other countries also immediately
banned the import of Canadian cattle and beef.
The international panel's endorsement of Canada's handling of the mad cow
crisis is seen as crucial in getting borders opened to Canadian cattle and
beef.

[The International Experts Team's report is a balanced and scientifically
sound document which should be carefully studied; in view of its
significance, we have included the entire text above. Clearly, their
recommendations are not restricted to Canada but indicate "adjustments
which would serve to address the changed North American dynamic". They
correspond with previous risk-assessments of the Canadian (and USA's) BSE
situations: see BSE - Canada: Geographical BSE-Risk 20030529.1311 and
commentary to BSE, bovine - Canada (Alberta) (12) 20030615.1483.
The rigorous measures, including mass-cullings, taken by the CFIA following
the index-case diagnosis, could be justified in view of the failure to
identify the cow's farm of origin, the need to address consumers'concerns
and the wish to facilitate an early lifting of export bans. The Report
recommends a more selective culling policy in future.
Hopefully, the Canadian policy-makers will waste no time in making their
difficult and costly decisions in order to apply the Report's 7 concrete
recommendations and enable renewal of Canada's exports. The USA (and
Mexican?) authorities cannot escape seriously considering to follow the
same lines -- the sooner the better. - Mod.AS].
