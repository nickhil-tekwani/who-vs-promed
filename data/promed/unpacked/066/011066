Virulent Newcastle disease (vND) alert
--------------------------------------
Virulent Newcastle disease update: quarantine boundaries modified in Southern California

California State Veterinarian Dr. Annette Jones today [Wed 27 Feb 2019] modified Southern California's quarantine area to further restrict bird movement as work continues to eradicate virulent Newcastle disease (vND). The quarantine mandates the reporting of sick birds and prohibits poultry owners from moving birds in all of Los Angeles County, and in large areas of San Bernardino and Riverside counties.

The modified quarantine extends from the northern and southern borders of western Riverside County to the Salton Sea--including the Coachella Valley--and as far east as Yucca Valley in San Bernardino County, with a northern boundary of State Route 58 at the Kern County line. The quarantine language and a map may be found at CDFA's VND Web site.

The quarantine requires bird owners to allow diagnostic testing, to isolate poultry from other species, to cease exhibitions, to stop the shipping and receiving of birds, and to enhance biosecurity.

"By modifying the quarantine area in Southern California, we are building upon an ongoing effort to eradicate virulent Newcastle disease," said Dr. Jones. "The primary way that VND spreads is by people moving sick birds. Extending the prohibition of bird movement across a larger area is the next logical step in being able to stop the spread of the virus and to eradicate the disease."

VND is a nearly-always fatal respiratory infection in poultry. Birds may seem healthy but will die within days of being infected. There is no cure. The virus is also transmitted by people who have VND on their clothes or shoes, and by equipment or vehicles that can transport the disease from place to place.

There are no human health concerns provided any meat or eggs are cooked properly. People who come in direct contact with the virus may develop conjunctivitis-like symptoms or run a mild fever.

The only way to stop the virus and eradicate the disease is to euthanize birds. This includes all infected birds as well as birds within heavily-infected areas.

Since May 2018, staff from the California Department of Agriculture (CDFA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) have been working in joint incident command to eradicate VND in Southern California. The highly contagious virus has resulted, or will soon result, in the euthanasia of more than one million birds in Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura counties.

Birds from 4 poultry industry producers in Riverside County and 2 poultry industry producers in San Bernardino County have also been infected with VND and all birds in those facilities have been or will be euthanized.

For more information about movement restrictions, biosecurity, and testing requirements, please call the Sick Bird Hotline (866) 922-2473 or email SFSPermits@cdfa.ca.gov

Attention:
Residents in Areas of Active vND Virus Spread
Message from State Veterinarian, Dr. Annette Jones
--------------------------------------------------
Due to progression and duration of a virulent Newcastle Disease (vND) outbreak in parts of Southern California, the State Veterinarian has ordered mandatory euthanasia of birds in some neighborhoods within or near:

- Compton and Whittier (Los Angeles County)
- Eastvale, Menifee, Mira Loma/Jurupa Valley, Norco, Nuevo, Perris, and Riverside City (Riverside County)
- Fontana, Hesperia, Highland, Muscoy, and Ontario (San Bernardino County)

Unfortunately, even birds and flocks previously testing negative, but now falling within a designated mandatory euthanasia area, must be euthanized. USDA/CDFA staff will contact affected bird owners with orders specific to their property.

While this action is difficult for all involved, it MUST be done to eradicate VND. Otherwise, the disease will continue to spread and kill additional flocks.

For more information please refer to: virulent Newcastle disease FAQs or call the Sick Bird Hotline at 866-922-2473

[USDA continues to post notices of more birds found with Newcastle disease virus https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDAAPHIS/bulletins/233803c, but this notice from California seems to give a bit more information regarding the situation.

For those in the euthanasia zone this is incredibly hard as it includes exotic birds, pet birds and commercial birds. Economically it is hard on the commercial/production bird owners, but emotionally it is especially hard on the exotic and pet bird owners. Many of these exotic and even many of the pet birds are very expensive and the pets and people are emotionally bonded.

While one may think only of the owners, the act of euthanasia can impact veterinarians and workers emotionally and psychologically. It is not easy on veterinarians take a pet or any animal's life.

What is most baffling is why, when this outbreak has been going on for many months more owners are not vaccinating their birds, especially their pet birds. - Mod.TG
