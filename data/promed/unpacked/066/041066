AVIAN INFLUENZA - ASIA (22): THAILAND, H5N1, REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

The data provided in the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) report
of 30 Aug 2005 submitted by Thailand cited in ProMED-mail posting
20050903.2603 seem to suggest the existence -- or appearance -- of possible
resistance to H5N1 in one or more native Thai chicken breeds. The OIE
report indicates that in one reported outbreak none of the 10 infected
chickens died, and in another only 5 of 15 infected chickens died.
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/aIS_55.htm#Sec3>
If the phenomenon is widespread, it seems that this could indicate that
native chicken flocks as well as domestic ducks are serving as reservoirs
for H5N1 virus in SE Asia.
Does anyone know of any available reports or technical analyses of this issue?
