Chronic wasting disease (CWD) has been diagnosed in 2 deer killed during a
hunt in the Organ Mountains east of Las Cruces, state officials say.
New Mexico now has recorded 6 cases of the disease, all in deer. The malady
is always fatal to deer or elk.
The other cases occurred on White Sands Missile Range, adjacent to the
mountains in southern New Mexico, where the first case was detected in June
2002 in a mule deer. The latest 2 cases were confirmed among 7 deer killed
during the January hunt. The infected animals were shot on the western
slope of the Organ Mountains, where the deer population has plummeted in
recent years, said Kerry Mower, a wildlife disease specialist with the
state Department of Game and Fish.
The cause of the population plunge is not known, he said. State officials
will try to establish, through random testing of deer during the next 12
months, the prevalence in the small herds on the missile range and in the
Organ Mountains, Mower said.
State officials will then have to determine if and when to pursue a herd
eradication effort, he said. "We haven't discussed it enough for me to give
you an answer," Mower said. "But that question is uppermost."
CWD creates sponge-like holes in a deer's brain, causing the animal to grow
thin, act abnormal, and die. The disease is similar to mad cow disease
(Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE). There never has been a known case
of CWD being transferred to humans or livestock.
Once found only in small areas of Colorado and Wyoming, the disease has
spread to elk ranches and wild deer herds as far away as Wisconsin.
New Mexico officials are not sure how the disease arrived at White Sands.
"You'd think this (question of transmission) would be the easiest question
to answer, but the fact is, we don't know," Mower said Saturday. "It's just
very baffling."
