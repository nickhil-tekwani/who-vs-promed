Researchers say a serious new form of a viral poultry disease has been found in Washington state.

Infectious bursal disease virus, [known as IBD], is not known to infect people or other animals. Washington State University's [WSU] animal disease lab says it has been confirmed in one flock of birds here -- the 1st confirmed case in the United States outside of California.

This form of the disease was first documented in California in 2008, said Dr Tim Baszler, director of the WSU lab. It typically kills 25 percent to 30 percent of a flock, and birds 3 to 6 weeks old are especially susceptible. It can also suppress their immune system, making them more susceptible to secondary diseases.

Baszler said there's no public health concern, but it is troubling for those who raise chickens or turkeys. "It doesn't get into the food supply," he said Saturday [15 Mar 2014]. "These aren't egg-laying birds or birds that are ready to be slaughtered for food consumption."

No information was immediately released about where the confirmed case originated, but Baszler noted that most of the state's poultry farms are in western Washington.

Researchers say wild birds, such as healthy ducks, guinea hens, pheasants, and quail, have been found to be naturally infected, but it doesn't appear that they play any major role in the spread of disease to domestic poultry. Affected birds can appear lethargic and unsteady and have diarrhea, symptoms that can be caused by other illnesses. For that reason, experts advise that definitive diagnosis be made through post-mortem examination and testing. Baszler said birds can be protected through vaccination.

[It is important to note this is the 1st case in Washington state. Hopefully this disease was caught early and will be limited to this one flock.

Washington state may be found on the interactive HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=2336922,248.

Infectious bursal disease (IBD, Gumboro) is an acute, highly contagious viral infection in chickens manifested by inflammation and subsequent atrophy of the bursa of Fabricius (also called the cloacal bursa, it is a primary lymphoid organ in birds), various degrees of nephroso-nephritis and immunosuppression. Clinically the disease is seen only in chickens older than 3 weeks. The feathers around the vent are usually stained with faeces containing plenty of urates.

The period of most apparent clinical symptoms and high death rate is at the age of 3-6 weeks. IBD could however be observed as long as chickens have a functioning bursa (up to the age of 16 weeks). In chickens younger than 3 weeks, IBD could be subclinical, but injured bursa leads to immunosuppression. Also, diarrhoea, anorexia, depression, ruffled feathers, especially in the region of the head and the neck are present.

A natural IBD infection is mostly observed in chickens. In turkeys and ducks it could occur subclinically, without immunosuppression. Most isolates of the IBD virus in turkeys are serologically different from those in chickens. In premises, once contaminated with the IBD virus, the disease tends to recur, usually as subclinical infection. The dead bodies are dehydrated, often with haemorrhages in the pectoral, thigh, and abdominal muscles.

The IBD virus belongs to the _Birnaviridae_ family of RNA viruses. 2 serotypes are known to exist, but only serotype 1 is pathogenic. The virus is highly resistant to most disinfectants and environmental conditions. In contaminated premises, it could persist for months and in water, forage, and faeces for weeks. The incubation period is short and the 1st symptoms appear 2-3 days after infection. The lesions in the bursa of Fabricius are progressive. In the beginning, the bursa is enlarged, oedematous, and covered with a gelatinous transudate.

IBD virus has a lymphocytic effect and the most severe injuries are in the lymph follicles of the bursa of Fabricius. Most commonly, IBD begins as a serous bursitis.

Lesions undergo various stages of serous haemorrhagic to severe haemorrhagic inflammation. The morbidity rate is very high and could reach 100 percent, whereas the mortality rate is 20-30 percent. The course of the disease is 5-7 days and the peak mortality occurs in the middle of this period.

In some cases, the bursa is filled with coagulated fibrinous exudate that usually forms casts with the shape of mucosal folds. In birds surviving the acute stage of the disease, the bursa is progressively atrophying. Microscopically, an atrophy of follicles into the bursa is observed secondary to inflammatory and dystrophic necrobiotic alterations.

The kidneys are affected by a severe urate diathesis. In an acute outbreak and manifestation of the typical clinical signs, the diagnostics is not difficult. The diagnosis could be confirmed by detection of typical gross lesions throughout a patho-anatomical study. IBD should be differentiated from IBH (inclusion body hepatitis). The application of live vaccines in chickens is a key point in the prevention of IBD and should be related to the levels of maternal antibodies.
