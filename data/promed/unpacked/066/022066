_Echinococcus_ spp: Humans are susceptible to the larval form of the
parasite, we are not infected with the adult parasite. The definitive hosts
are canine and feline depending of the species of _Echinococcus_. We (and
the intermediate hosts that include mostly mammals) are infected by the
ingestion of EGGS deposited in the environment (via feces) by the
definitive hosts, which in turn will be infected by eating hydatid cyst
containing SCOLICES (a stage/portion of the tape worm) included in the
liver, lungs and other organs.
Each scolex will generate an adult parasite in the small intestine of the
definitive host. Each ingested egg will liberate an embryo that migrate
from the intestine to major blood vessels and reach the liver or lungs
primarily. The embryo will develop further in a cystic structure with
fluid, with an inner membrane that will generate scolices, the infective
form for the definitive host. The life cycle will occur in nature without
the participation of humans as hosts. Humans will facilitate the cycle in
farms by feeding dogs _E. granulosus_ infected livers and lungs, creating a
public health risk because infected dogs will distribute eggs in the
environment, exposing humans and farm animals to this incurable parasitic
disease.

If we are talking about human infection with _Echinococcus_ the eggs occur
in ripe segments of the (very small) tapeworm in the intestine of dogs (and
some other carnivores), the gravid segments and their eggs being passed out
with dog feces. Getting onto grass, these infect herbivores. People
handling dogs or dog feces may get eggs on their hands and accidentally
swallow them. This may apply particularly to children playing with infected
dogs - the resulting hydatid cyst often not being diagnosed till they are
adult.
Pigs wandering loose will often eat feces, human or, presumably, dog. If
the pigs infected with hydatid cysts had access to feces from dogs or foxes
or whatever, which were carrying the tapeworms in their intestines, this
could have caused he infection.
