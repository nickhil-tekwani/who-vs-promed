CLONING AND DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY (04)

There can be little doubt that that a group of cloned animals would likely
have extreme susceptibility to particular infectious agents as a result of
having no diversity in immune response genes (including MHC). This is,
however, only one of several problems associated with a lack of genetic
diversity. Propagating animals strictly by cloning would essentially
eliminate any prospect for making genetic progress in production traits,
and I don't know of any animal breeders that are satisfied with the
animals we have now. I agree that it is very unlikely that cloned animals,
particular cattle, will have any direct utility in production agriculture
in the near future, if for no other reason than that the procedure is
going to be much more expensive that standard breeding (even if efficiency
improves by one or two orders of magnitude). This is not to say that
cloned mammals will not have a place in agriculture. If the cost of
generating clones is not prohibitive, they should, for example, be
exceptionally useful in basic agricultural research, similarly to inbred
stains of mice.
[Sorry, Richard, this posting got reroute down a very slow cyberspace
highway since you sent it to us when this topic was up. Despite the
tardiness of our connect, I think your comments definitely round out our
discussion on cloning. Thanks very much for the submission. Mod. pc]
