An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] type Asia 1 has occurred
in Changqing District of Jinan City, capital of east China's Shandong
Province, China's Ministry of Agriculture announced on Friday [30 Dec
2005].
Altogether 91 cattle in the farm which reported the outbreak have
been culled by the provincial veterinary bureau, the Ministry said.
Some cattle on a farm in Changqing District developed symptoms of bad
appetite and fever on 6 Dec 2005, and 48 cattle had fallen ill by 25
Dec.
The provincial veterinary bureau reported the case as a suspected
outbreak of FMD after initial tests on 26 Dec 2005. It was confirmed
by the state laboratory for FMD control on 29 Dec 2005.
Apart from culling the entire herd to which the sick cattle belonged,
the Shandong provincial government and the Ministry of Agriculture
also ordered an immediate disinfection and quarantine of the outbreak
site, as well as a thorough inoculation of all vulnerable animals in
the region.

[On 16 Nov 2005, China reported to the OIE that the 2 FMD Asia 1
outbreaks, initially recorded On 13 May 2005 in Shandong and Jiangsu
provinces, have been eradicated and quarantines in the affected areas
have been lifted. See <http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_44.HTM#Sec7>.
It seems now that the disease, unfortunately, is still there.
Official notification to the OIE is anticipated. Information on the
disease situation in other provinces and species, with particular
attention to pigs, which are regarded prolific spreaders of the
virus, will be helpful.
