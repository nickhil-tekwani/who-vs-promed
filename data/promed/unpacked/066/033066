Headlines
Summary of newly-reported viruses this week:
- Afghanistan: 1 new case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) has been confirmed this week, occurring in Kunar province.
- Pakistan: One new case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) has been confirmed this week, occurring in Balochistan province. This is the 1st case reported in 2018.

Afghanistan
- 1 new case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) has been confirmed this week. The case occurred in Ghaziabad district, Kunar province, with onset of paralysis on [3 Mar 2018].
- This raises the total number of officially reported WPV1 cases in Afghanistan in 2018 to 7.
- The next set of supplementary immunization days are planned for [9 Apr 2018], during which vaccinators will aim to vaccinate children across 24 provinces using bOPV. The beginning of the campaign is synchronised with a campaign that will take place in Pakistan, part of efforts to interrupt transmission of the virus across the shared border.

Pakistan
- 1 new case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) has been confirmed this week. The case occurred in Dukki district, Balochistan province, with onset of paralysis on [8 Mar 2018].
- This is the 1st case reported in 2018. The total number of officially reported WPV1 cases in Pakistan in 2017 remains 8.
- The next set of supplementary immunization days are planned for [9 Apr 2018], during which vaccinators will aim to vaccinate children across 8 provinces using bOPV. The beginning of the campaign is synchronised with a campaign that will take place in Afghanistan, part of efforts to interrupt transmission of the virus across the shared border.

Nigeria
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week.
- The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 is 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017 or 2018.
- The most recent case (by date of onset) was reported in Monguno Local Government Area, Borno, with onset on [21 Aug 2016].
- Nigeria continues to implement an emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016).
- The next immunization activities are planned to take place in the coming days, synchronized with campaigns in countries across the Lake Chad basin.
- As part of the emergency response, subnational surveillance continues to be strengthened.

Lake Chad Basin
- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno state, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto states in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin.
- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.
- These activities include efforts to vaccinate children at markets, in internally displaced persons camps, and at international borders.
- The next immunization activities are planned to take place in the coming days, synchronized across countries in the Lake Chad basin.

Central Africa
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
- The total number of officially reported cVDPV2 cases in the DRC in 2018 remains 3.
- The most recent case (by date of onset) was reported in Mulongo district, Haut Lomami province, with onset of paralysis on [31 Jan 2018].
- The Ministry of Health, supported by WHO and partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, remains fully committed to outbreak response, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) across the country, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols.
- Children living in the districts where the latest cases were reported were last targeted with mOPV2 during December [2018] vaccination days. The next campaign will take place following the completion of microplanning exercises to ensure high vaccination coverage during campaigns.
- Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.

Horn of Africa
- No new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) positive environmental samples were reported in the past week in Somalia.
- The most recent sample (by date of collection) was reported in Hodan district, Banadir province collected on [22 Feb 2018].
- Before this most recent sample, 3 cVDPV2s were isolated from 2 environmental samples collected in Hamarweyn district, Banadir province (Mogadishu), Somalia, 1 on [4 Jan 2018], and 1 on [11 Jan 2018]. These latest isolates are genetically linked to previously isolated VDPV2s from 2017, collected on [22 Oct 2017 and 2 Nov 2017] from environmental samples collected from Waberi district, Banadir province. In total, 4 environmental samples (with 7 unique virus sequences) positive for cVDPV2 were collected in Somalia between October 2017, and January 2018.
- No cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) associated with this cVDPV2 have been detected at this time - the viruses were all isolated from environmental samples.
- Since detection of the initial isolates in 2017, outbreak response campaigns in line with internationally-agreed guidelines have been implemented, consisting of 2 large-scale immunization activities.
- Surveillance for AFP cases in the area is being strengthened, and planning for the next immunization campaign is ongoing.
- WHO and its partners are continuing to support local public health authorities in conducting field investigations and risk assessments to more clearly assess any potential risk of circulation of the identified cVDPV2, and to continue to support the outbreak response and strengthening of disease surveillance.

Middle East
- No new cases of circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in Syria.
- The total number of officially reported cVDPV2 cases in Syria in 2017 remains 74. There are no cases reported in 2018.
- The most recent case (by date of onset) was reported in Boukamal district, with onset on [21 Sep 2017].

[2] Strategy for accessing security challenged zones - media report
Date: Mon 2 Apr 2018 12:01am
Source: The Times [edited]
https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/clerics-urge-jihadists-to-spare-polio-vaccine-teams-znp7scv0s


Muslim leaders are trying to persuade the Taliban and Islamic State in Afghanistan to allow polio vaccination teams into areas that they control after a new outbreak of the disease.

Clerics have been brought in with the approval of the government to try to broker a deal to allow medics into regions where they have previously been threatened or attacked. Only 3 countries - Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria - have failed to eradicate polio and 6 cases [now 8, see above] have been officially confirmed this year [2018].

Islamist militants have traditionally been hostile towards vaccination campaigns, suspecting that they were a conspiracy to sterilise Muslim children or a cover for spies. Clerics involved in the mediation efforts have said that there were no religious reasons to oppose the programme.

The Afghan government's latest polio eradication initiative involves more than 70 000 polio workers and volunteers who began trying to vaccinate almost 10 million children last month [March 2018] across the country in a programme partly funded by the UK.

A cleric from Kunar in Afghanistan, told The Times: "In Islam cure of a disease is permitted and the militants should not ban the vaccination campaigns in the region".

[Since the last update on 24 Mar 2018 (see Poliomyelitis update (11): global (Afghanistan, DR Congo) 20180324.5706145) there have been 3 newly confirmed cases of WPV1 associated polio reported - 2 in Afghanistan and 1 in Pakistan - the 1st case confirmed in Pakistan this year [2018]. There have been no newly confirmed cases of VDPV2 reported from Syria, nor from the Democratic Republic of the Congo nor from Somalia. It is too early to formally declare interruption of transmission of the VDPV2's in all 3 countries although it is now 6 months since the last reported case in Syria.

The media report is promising as the radical groups have been against vaccination activities and have been responsible for violence against vaccination workers as well as spreading rumors among the population resulting in vaccine refusal. Hopefully there will be security assured for the vaccination workers with greater acceptance of the polio vaccine in the population.
