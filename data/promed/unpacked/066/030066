Novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infections in 3 pregnant women - United
States, April-May 2009
-------------------------------------------------------------
CDC first identified cases of respiratory infection with a novel influenza
A (H1N1) virus in the United States on [15 Apr 2009 and 17 Apr 2009] (1).
During seasonal influenza epidemics and previous pandemics, pregnant women
have been at increased risk for complications related to influenza
infection (2-5). In addition, maternal influenza virus infection and
accompanying hyperthermia place fetuses at risk for complications such as
birth defects and preterm birth (6). As part of surveillance for infection
with the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus, CDC initiated surveillance for
pregnant women who were infected with the novel virus. As of [10 May 2009],
a total of 20 cases of novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection had been
reported among pregnant women in the United States, including 15 confirmed
cases and 5 probable cases.* Among the 13 women from 7 states for whom data
are available, the median age was 26 years (range: 15-39 years); 3 women
were hospitalized, one of whom died. This report provides preliminary
details of 3 cases of novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection in pregnant
women. Pregnant women with confirmed, probable, or suspected novel
influenza A (H1N1) virus infection should receive antiviral treatment for 5
days. Oseltamivir is the preferred treatment for pregnant women, and the
drug regimen should be initiated within 48 hours of symptom onset, if
possible. Pregnant women who are in close contact with a person with
confirmed, probable, or suspected novel influenza A (H1N1) infection should
receive a 10 day course of chemoprophylaxis with zanamivir or oseltamivir.

Case reports
------------
Patient A. On [15 Apr 2009], a woman aged 33 years at 35 weeks' gestation
with a one day history of myalgias, dry cough, and low-grade fever was
examined by her obstetrician. She had been in relatively good health and
had been taking no medications other than prenatal vitamins, although she
had a history of psoriasis and mild asthma. The patient had not recently
traveled to Mexico. Rapid influenza diagnostic testing performed in the
physician's office was positive.

On [19 Apr 2009], she was examined in a local emergency department, with
worsening shortness of breath, fever, and productive cough. She experienced
severe respiratory distress, with an oxygen saturation of about 80 per cent
on room air and a respiratory rate of about 30 breaths per minute. A chest
radiograph revealed bilateral nodular infiltrates. The patient required
intubation and was placed on mechanical ventilation. On [19 Apr 2009], an
emergency cesarean delivery was performed, resulting in a female infant
with Apgar scores of 4 at 1 minute after birth and of 6 at 5 minutes after
birth; the infant is healthy and has been discharged home. On [21 Apr
2009], the patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
The patient began receiving oseltamivir on [28 Apr 2009]. She also received
broad spectrum antibiotics and remained on mechanical ventilation. The
patient died on [4 May 2009].

On [25 Apr 2009], a nasopharyngeal swab specimen collected from patient A
indicated an unsubtypable influenza A strain by real-time reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) at the San Antonio Metro
Health Laboratory. The specimen was forwarded to the Virus Surveillance and
Diagnostic Branch Laboratory, Influenza Division, CDC, where testing was
inconclusive for novel influenza A (H1N1) virus. On [30 Apr 2009], a repeat
nasopharyngeal specimen was collected, which was positive by rRT-PCR for
novel influenza A (H1N1) virus at CDC.

Patient B. A previously healthy woman aged 35 years at 32 weeks' gestation
was seen at a local emergency department on [20 Apr 2009] with a one day
history of shortness of breath, fever, cough, diarrhea, headache, myalgias,
sore throat, and inspiratory chest pain. She was febrile (101.6 deg F [38.7
deg C]), with a heart rate of 128 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 22
breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of greater than 97 per cent on
room air. A chest radiograph was normal. Rapid influenza diagnostic testing
was negative. The patient received a parenteral nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory medication, acetaminophen, and inhaled albuterol and was
discharged home. She was evaluated the following day in her obstetrician's
office, where a nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected and sent for
rRT-PCR testing. The patient received antibiotics, antinausea medication,
acetaminophen, and an inhaled corticosteroid. The patient recovered fully,
and her pregnancy is proceeding normally.

Patient B had been in Mexico during the 3 days preceding her arrival at the
emergency department. Several family members in Mexico and the United
States had recently been ill with influenza-like illness, and her sister
had been hospitalized for pneumonia during the preceding week. Testing of
the nasopharyngeal swab specimen from patient B collected on [21 Apr 2009]
was identified as an unsubtypable influenza A strain by rRT-PCR testing at
the Naval Health Research Laboratory in San Diego. Additional testing at
CDC confirmed infection with novel influenza A (H1N1) virus.

Patient C. On [29 Apr 2009], a woman aged 29 years at 23 weeks' gestation
was experiencing cough, sore throat, chills, subjective fever, and weakness
of 1 day's duration and was seen at the family practice clinic where she
had been receiving prenatal care. The patient had a history of asthma but
was not taking any asthma medications. Her son, aged 10 years, reportedly
had similar symptoms the week before the onset of her symptoms. Another
son, aged 7 years, had become ill on the same day as his mother and
accompanied her to the clinic. At the clinic, the younger son was coughing
vigorously and was asked to put on a mask by office staff members. Rapid
influenza diagnostic testing in the family practice clinic of a
nasopharyngeal sample from patient C was positive. The woman was prescribed
oseltamivir, which she began taking later the same day. Her symptoms are
resolving without complications, and her pregnancy is proceeding normally.

Patient C had not traveled to Mexico recently. Her son aged 7 years also
was prescribed oseltamivir on [29 Apr 2009] but was not tested for
influenza. The physician who evaluated patient C was also pregnant (13
weeks' gestation). The physician began chemoprophylaxis with oseltamivir
and has remained asymptomatic.

A nasopharyngeal swab collected from patient C on [29 Apr 2009] was
identified as an unsubtypable influenza A strain by the Washington State
Public Health Laboratory. Additional testing at CDC confirmed infection
with novel influenza A (H1N1) virus.

MMWR editorial note
-------------------
This report provides preliminary details on 3 cases of novel influenza A
(H1N1) virus infection in pregnant women. Additional information on these
cases and other pregnant women with this infection is being compiled by CDC
based on reports from state health departments. The 3 pregnant women
described in this report all initially had symptoms of acute febrile
respiratory illness similar to the clinical symptoms in nonpregnant women
with the infection; one patient (patient A) developed ARDS and died. The
most frequently reported symptoms among nonpregnant patients with novel
influenza A (H1N1) virus infection have been fever, cough, and sore throat (1).

Although data are insufficient to determine who is at highest risk for
complications of novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection, seasonal
influenza epidemics (2,3) and previous influenza pandemics (4,5) have shown
that pregnant women generally are at higher risk for influenza-associated
morbidity and mortality compared with women who are not pregnant. The
increased risk of complications is thought to be related to several
physiologic changes that occur during pregnancy, including alterations in
the cardiovascular, respiratory, and immune systems (7). Pregnant women
with underlying medical conditions such as asthma are at particularly high
risk for influenza-related complications (2). Because pregnant women are at
increased risk for influenza complications, the Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices and the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists have recommended that women receive the trivalent inactivated
influenza vaccine (8).

The novel influenza A (H1N1) virus that is circulating is susceptible to
the neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral medications, oseltamivir and
zanamivir (1). In randomized, placebo-controlled trials among outpatients,
these medications have reduced the severity and duration of symptoms of
seasonal influenza if started within 48 hours of illness onset, and limited
data from observational studies among hospitalized patients with seasonal
influenza indicate that oseltamivir can reduce mortality, even when started
more than 48 hours after illness onset (8). In addition, oseltamivir and
zanamivir have been highly effective in preventing seasonal influenza if
used shortly after exposure to the disease (8). Little information is
available on the safety or effectiveness of these medications when used
during pregnancy (9,10). However, considering the limited information
available and the known risks for influenza complications during pregnancy,
any potential risk to a fetus likely is outweighed by the expected benefits
of influenza antiviral treatment for this novel virus. Thus, CDC interim
guidance indicates that pregnant women with confirmed, probable, or
suspected novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection should receive antiviral
treatment for 5 days.**

Although zanamivir can be used in pregnancy, oseltamivir is preferred for
treatment of pregnant women because of its systemic absorption (10).
Theoretically, higher systemic absorption might suppress influenza viral
loads more effectively in sites other than the respiratory system (such as
placenta) and might provide better protection against mother-child
transmission. Similar to the recommendation for nonpregnant persons who are
treated, oseltamivir treatment should be initiated as soon as possible,
ideally within 48 hours of onset of symptoms. In addition, any pregnant
woman hospitalized with confirmed, probable, or suspected novel influenza A
(H1N1) virus infection should receive oseltamivir, even if more than 48
hours have elapsed since illness onset (8). Beginning treatment as early as
possible is critical. In addition, treating fevers in pregnant women with
acetaminophen is important because maternal hyperthermia has been
associated with various adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes (6).

In all clinical settings, including settings that provide care for pregnant
women, patients should be screened for signs and symptoms of febrile
respiratory illness at the initial point of contact, and these patients
should be promptly segregated and assessed. Outpatient clinical settings
and labor and delivery units should develop and implement procedures for
handling patients with respiratory illness and friends or family members
who might accompany them. Pregnant women who are in close contact with a
person who has a confirmed, probable, or suspected case should receive a 10
day course of chemoprophylaxis with zanamivir or oseltamivir. For
chemoprophylaxis in pregnant patients, a preferred anti-influenza
medication has not been determined. Although zanamivir might have the
benefit of more limited systemic absorption (9), respiratory symptoms such
as coughing or severe nasal congestion might limit its usefulness because
of its inhaled route of administration. The pregnant physician caring for
patient C began chemoprophylaxis soon after exposure.

Because of the increased risk for severe complications, the public health
response to outbreaks of novel influenza A (H1N1) virus should include
considerations specific to pregnant women. Interim guidance on issues
specific to pregnant women and the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus is
available at <http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/clinician_pregnant.htm>.
Additional information regarding novel influenza A (H1N1) virus is
available at <http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu>. Clinicians should report cases
of novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection in pregnant women to their
state or local health departments or CDC.

[To summarize the current situation, as of 6:00 AM GMT on 12 May 2009 a
total of 5251 cases and 60 deaths of influenza A (H1N1) infection have been
officially reported to WHO from 30 countries, up from 4694 confirmed cases
and 53 deaths from 29 countries yesterday (10 May 2009). As of 17:00 GMT-4,
a total of 5696 cases and 63 deaths have been reported worldwide, with 11
countries in the Americas reporting cases. In the past 24 hours, Cuba has
confirmed the 1st case of H1N1 infection (this is reflected in the PAHO
report at the end of the day in the Americas region). According to
newswires, Thailand and Finland have each confirmed 2 cases -- all of whom
have a history of travel to Mexico prior to onset of illness.

The USA has officially reported 3009 laboratory confirmed cases coming from
45 states (compared with 2600 cases from 44 states on 11 May 2009), and 3
deaths (one in a Mexican child with pre-existing illness visiting in the
USA, a 2nd in a resident of Texas with known pre-existing illness and a 3rd
in Washington State with known pre-existing illness). According to an MMWR
report released today (after the USA daily case count was released), there
was an additional death reported in a pregnant female attributable to H1N1
infection, which would bring the number of reported deaths to 4 (assuming
that this case is not one of the previously reported fatalities included in
the case count as of 12 May 2009). Canada has reported 358 cases from 10
provinces with 1 death in an individual with pre-existing illness, up from
330 cases and one death reported from 9 provinces on 11 May 2009. As of
8:40 AM GMT-5, Mexico has reported 2282 confirmed cases with 58 deaths
(compared with 2059 cases and 56 deaths on 9 May 2009).
