Another [human] anthrax case has been reported in the south of
Kyrgyzstan. A resident of Kyzyl-Kiya town has been hospitalized on
suspicion of the dangerous disease, the Emergency Ministry says.

Specialists have immediately left for the scene to take preventive and
anti-epidemic measures, after samples were sent for laboratory analysis.

As the news agency 24.kg earlier reported, doctors hospitalized 18
locals of the Aksy district, Jalalabad region on suspicion of anthrax
in June 2009, and some of them were diagnosed positively. After that,
over a hundred houses were subjected to anti-epidemic measures. In
2008, 10 residents of southern Kyrgyzstan were down with anthrax,
while one of them died in hospital.

In the meantime, according to officials of the Health Care Ministry,
the situation is under control.

[We can confidentially expect to see more human cases occur as the
anthrax season progresses in this part of southwest Kyrgyzstan,
abutting the Fergana valley of Uzbekistan. The uncontrolled nature of
this disease in the valley affects the adjoining areas of Kyrgyzstan,
thus the high incidence of this disease in Jalal-Abad and Osh.
