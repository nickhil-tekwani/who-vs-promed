MYCOBACTERIAL KERATITIS (3)
============================
[The original RFI reported a case of keratitis, following ophthalmic
surgery, in an apparently health young woman, with Mycobacterium
cheloniae identified. The reply, by Steve Grenard, discussed M.
cheloniae and its described association with reptiles. For background,
see: "Mycobacterial keratitis", promed archive.960319 (RFI) &
promed archive.960320 (reply). - Mod.]

Thanks for responding to my RFI. The patient has no reptile
contact but does have a dog, cat and horse. Any further info??
Thanks. Lee
