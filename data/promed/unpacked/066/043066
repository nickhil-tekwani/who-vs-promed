Natural Occurrence of Chilli veinal mottle virus on _Capsicum chinense_ in
China

0377C. Accepted for publication 30 Dec 2005.

An outbreak of a viral disease on chili pepper (_Capsicum chinense_ Jacp. cv.
Yellow Lantern) occurred in Hainan Province, China during 2003 and 2004. The
disease was prevalent in 5 chili-producing counties surveyed. Leaves of
infected plants initially displayed symptoms of dark green banding along veins
and later became distorted with striking mosaic. Infected plants had reduced
flower numbers and fruit set, resulting in a significant yield loss. The
causative virus was characterized and identified as Chilli veinal mottle virus
(ChiVMV) (3). An isolate of the virus was obtained via 3 single lesion
passages through _Chenopodium amaranticolor_ and was shown to reproduce the
same symptoms on inoculated _C. chinense_ cv. Yellow Lantern. Negative
staining of crude extracts of the infected tissue and subsequent electron
microscopy revealed flexuous rods of 12-13 x 750 nm, typical of a potyvirus.
Pinwheel-like inclusion bodies were abundant in thin sections of infected
leaves. Purified virus preparations contained one major protein of 32.8 kDa
and one minor protein of 28 kDa when fractionated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Both of these protein bands were excised
and subsequently analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Multiple peptide fragments
from both proteins were identified as arising from ChiVMV capsid protein (CP)
(1,2). Therefore, the 32.8-kDa protein is the full-length ChiVMV CP and the 28-
kDa protein is presumably a degradation product of the CP. The combined
biological and molecular data provided strong evidence that the viral disease
on _C. chinense_ was caused by ChiVMV.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of ChiVMV infection on _C.
chinense_ in China and the first report of _C. amaranticolor_ as an
experimental host for ChiVMV.

[The aphid-transmitted potyvirus chilli veinal mottle virus (ChiVMV) is
reported here for the first time in chili pepper (_Capsicum chinense_) in
Hainan Province, China from samples collected in 2003 and 2004. ChiVMV is one
of the most predominant viruses of peppers in Asia. Surveys in 16 Asian
countries have shown that 30 percent of pepper crops are affected by this
disease. Flower drop is normally severe following infection with this virus
and therefore crop loss can be heavy. Growing transplants in insect-proof
facilities, avoiding weeds and other solanaceous crops (e.g. tomato), planting
early to avoid aphid flights, and using mineral oil sprays are methods used in
attempts to manage the disease.
_Capsicum chinense_, the crop plant infected, remains the least understood of
the domesticated pepper taxa with respect to center of origin and its probable
progenitor. Fruit shape can vary from long and slender to short and obtuse.
Fruit can be extremely pungent and aromatic, with persistent pungency when
eaten. The best-known cultivars are the very hot Habanero peppers, such as
Scotch Bonnet. The see also section lists past postings on viruses of pepper.
This post is the first on ChiVMV.
