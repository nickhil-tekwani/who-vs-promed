Abstract
--------
We report the detection and gene coding sequences of 3 novel _Orbivirus_ species found in 6 dead farmed white-tailed deer in the United States. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that the new orbiviruses are genetically closely related to the Guangxi, Mobuck, Peruvian horse sickness, and Yunnan orbiviruses, which are thought to be solely borne by mosquitos. However, 4 of the 6 viruses analyzed in this work were found as co-infecting agents along with a known cervid pathogen, epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus-2 (EHDV-2), raising questions as to whether the new viruses are primary pathogens or secondary pathogens that exacerbate EHDV-2 infections. Moreover, EHDV-2 is known to be a _Culicoides_-borne virus, raising additional questions as to whether _Culicoides_ species can also serve as vectors for the novel orbiviruses, if mosquitoes can vector EHDV-2, or whether the deer were infected through separate bites by the insects. Our findings expand knowledge of the possible viral pathogens of deer in the United States. Moreover, due to the close genetic relatedness of the 3 new orbiviruses to viruses that are primary pathogens of cattle and horses, our findings also underscore a crucial need for additional research on the potential role of the 3 new orbiviruses as pathogens of other animals.

[Two groups of Orbivirus cause hemorrhagic disease (HD) in deer from North America: the epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) group and the bluetongue virus (BTV) group (Reoviridae: _Orbivirus_). HD is the most important viral disease affecting white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) and mule deer (_O. hemionus_) in the United States.

EHDV and BTV are transmitted between their ruminant hosts by species of _Culicoides_ biting midges. Available data suggest that the species of _Culicoides_ that transmit EHDV are likely to be similar though not necessarily the same as for BTV.

The 3 new orbivirus species along with 3 variants in dead farmed white-tailed deer warrant continued surveillance efforts and further studies to determine the potential threat these viruses may pose to farmed and wild white-tailed deer populations and possibly to other animals. - Mod.PMB
