The number of victims from last week's lunch-box food poisoning has
risen to nearly 500 as health officials identified the source of the
contamination.
Consultant doctor Mak Kwok-hang, from the Department of Health, said
it had traced 774 children from the three schools affected.
Sixty-four per cent, or 493 children, had reported symptoms after
eating from the lunch boxes.
_Clostridium perfringens_ had been found in the food, Dr Mak said.
"If food handlers do not pay special attention to environmental and
food hygiene, the bacteria will get into the food and then multiply,"
Dr Mak said. "That's why we always advise people to keep the food
either above 65 degrees celsius or below four degrees so that
bacteria cannot multiply."
Dr Mak said the poisoning was caused by improper food handling
procedures at [name deleted] factory in Kwun Tong. "We found that the
gravy had been stored at room temperature for a night which allowed
ample time for the bacteria to multiply," he said.
The schools whose students were hit by the food poisoning are looking
for alternative suppliers.
