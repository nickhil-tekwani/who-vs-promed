There is a high risk of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever [CCHF] in a number of Turkish provinces, the Turkish newspaper Milliyet reported on 10 Jul [2015]. Prophylactic work is being conducted to reduce the risk of infection in the provinces of Tokat, Sivas, Amasya, and Corum.

Earlier it was reported that 2 people died of this fever in the province of Adana on 9 Jun [2015].

Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever is usually transmitted to humans by ticks and livestock.

Some 6500 cases of infection were revealed in Turkey from 2002 to the present day [10 Jul 2015]. Some 650 people died. Some 378 cases of infection were revealed in Turkey in 2015 [2014 or 2015? We have received no reports this year (2015) until now. - Mod.TY]

[CCHF virus is endemic in Turkey and cases sporadically occur there. Only 4 countries report more than 50 CCHF cases per year -- Iran, Russia, Turkey, and Uzbekistan. It would be of interest to know what the nature of the prophylactic work is. Tick control over large areas is difficult. Circumstances under which the patients acquired their CCHF virus infections are not stated in the above report. They probably acquired the infection via a tick bite or exposure to the blood of an infected animal.

The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities can also occur.

The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.

CCHF virus is a tickborne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_.
