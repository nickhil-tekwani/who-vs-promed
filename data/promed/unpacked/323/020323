Based on ongoing epidemiologic investigations, additional ill persons infected with a different serotype of Salmonella, _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Hadar, reported contact with chicks, ducklings, and other live baby poultry sourced from Mt. Healthy Hatcheries, and this strain has been added to the outbreak investigation.

As of 25 Jun 2014, a total of 251 persons infected with the outbreak strains of _S._ Infantis, Newport, or Hadar have been reported from 37 states. Since the last update on 30 May 2014, a total of 125 new ill persons have been reported from 32 states: Alabama (1), Arkansas (2), California (2), Colorado (1), Connecticut (1), Florida (1), Georgia (6), Iowa (2), Illinois (4), Indiana (2), Kansas (1), Kentucky (3), Maine (4), Maryland (1), Michigan (1), Mississippi (2), Montana (2), New Jersey (1) New York (15), North Carolina (13), Ohio (8), Pennsylvania (10), South Carolina (2), South Dakota (3), Tennessee (6), Texas (2), Vermont (3), Virginia (9), Washington (6), West Virginia (9), Wisconsin (1), and Wyoming (1).

Among the persons who reported the date they became ill, illnesses began between 4 Feb 2014 and 4 Jun 2014. Ill persons range in age from younger than one year to 95 years, and the median age is 28 years. 39 percent of ill persons are 10 years of age or younger. 51 percent of ill persons are female. Among 171 ill persons with available information, 54 (32 percent) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Investigation of the Outbreak:
Epidemiologic and traceback investigations conducted by officials in local, state, and federal public health agencies indicate that contact with live poultry sourced from Mt. Healthy Hatcheries in Ohio is the likely source of this outbreak of salomonellosis.

Findings of multiple traceback investigations of live baby poultry from homes of ill persons have identified Mt. Healthy Hatcheries in Ohio as the source of chicks and ducklings. This hatchery uses multiple source flocks to obtain eggs and chicks, so it is unclear at this time where the contamination originated. This is the same mail-order hatchery that has been associated with multiple outbreaks of human salmonellosis linked to live poultry in the past, including in 2012 and 2013. Public health, veterinary, and agriculture officials continue to work with this hatchery and have made recommendations for improvement. This hatchery is a member of the USDA National Poultry Improvement Plan, a program that is intended to eliminate certain strains of Salmonella that cause illness in poultry breeding flocks and hatcheries but does not certify that these live poultry are free from other strains of Salmonella that may cause human illness.

Contact with live poultry can be a source of human salmonellosis. Many ill persons in this outbreak reported bringing the live poultry into their homes, and others reported kissing or cuddling with the live poultry. These behaviors increase a person's risk of a Salmonella infection from contact with live poultry. People can get sick even if they do not have direct contact with the live poultry but touch items and places that have been contaminated in the poultry's environment. Always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water right after touching live poultry or anything in the area where they live and roam. Adults should supervise hand washing for young children. These recommendations are important and apply to all live poultry regardless of the age of the birds or where they were purchased.

[As in the continuing outbreak of _S._ Heidelberg linked to chicken and chicken parts for sale (Salmonellosis, st Heidelberg - USA (06): chicken, continuing alert 20140627.2566071), no concrete action has been taken to minimize the risk of salmonellosis from contact with live poultry. There is no doubt it may be quite difficult to produce _Salmonella_- or _Campylobacter_-free birds, so better education may be the answer, as recalling or banning the selling of small fowl are not likely, as was done with small turtles. Caveat emptor, let the buyer beware. - Mod.LL
