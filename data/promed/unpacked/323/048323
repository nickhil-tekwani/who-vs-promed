Mr. Charles Arthur of the British newspaper The Independent obtained the
following data from the UK Ministry of Agriculture, Farms, and Fisheries
(MAFF) and posted the data to the listserve BSE-L.
FSE in UK: by year and age, of onset of clinical signs.
YR/AGE 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 Total
0-2yr 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
2-4yr 0 0 2 3 0 0 0 1 0 6
4-6yr 0 6 3 4 4 7 2 1 0 27
6-8yr 1 4 2 5 5 5 0 2 2 26
8-10yr 0 3 2 2 1 0 2 0 0 10
10-12yr 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 1 4
12-14yr 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 3
14-16yr 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
Total 1 16 10 14 10 14 4 7 3 79
It is an interesting feature of this data that the age distribution does not
shift forward with time. The age of peak incidence is about 6 years for all
years listed. If the epidemic were caused by a feeding event in the past, a
shift to older animals would occur as time passed and no new cases were
introduced.
Given the inconsistency of the data with a typical cat life expectancy (the
extrapolation to zero cases occurs in 2016), and the lack of obvious forward
shift in average age at onset with time, a simpler explanation would be
constant exposure to an infectious agent of increasing scarcity. The decline
in cases with time would then represent the decline in infectious agent
exposure.

There is not much to go on, re the shifting of age distribution, but I agree
there is no real indication that it has shifted.
A single case (2-4 years, onset 1996) is clearly born after the ban of SBO
in pet food (autumn 1990). All other cases could be ascribed to pet food
contamination before that. A large proportion of these FSE cases occurred in
cats born quite early during the BSE epidemic, some indeed before it the
epidemic even started. I interpret this to mean, that these cats were not
predominantly affected by exposure while they were very young (we have
indication that this could be the case with cows). Exposure to high doses in
adult life, or possibly cumulative exposure to smaller doses, could be an
explanation. If we are viewing the FSE thing as an infection, we have no
indication of any typical incubation time from these data.
A speculation: Maybe younger cases have a higher probability to be diagnosed
FSE positive than older cases. This could have stunted the age distribution
in the older age groups.

First things first.
>>Question concerning cat food ... do impoverished OAPs in the UK still eat
cat food? When I lived in the UK >20 years ago it was something known but not
discussed.<<
I have no idea. It was probably close to apocryphal anyway.
I would be very surprised indeed if any cat food manufacturer made cat food in
animal feed mills. The Spillers mill in London (that closed decades ago)
claimed to be the only mill doing this anyway. I would be even more
surprised if they used UK MBM given the loss of market that happened over
FSE. They are multinationals and they *certainly* used and specified
continental MBM in their continental plants. I would not be surprised if
they imported continental cat food for the UK.

[Would any of our members with clinical experience of FSE cases care to
comment? How does this disease present itself and are there differences
depending on the age of the cat. Our healthy 18yr old sleeps and sometimes
has to be reminded about meals. Anecdotes aside and realising the softness
of these data, it is interesting to note that diagnosis of FSE in cats >12
yrs started only in 1996. I assume that is the age but whoever assembled
this MAFF table was statistically challenged. - Mod.MHJ
