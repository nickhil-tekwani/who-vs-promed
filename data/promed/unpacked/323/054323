[Although it has been a long time since Newcastle Disease has been
seen in these states -- since 1982 in Baja California and 2003 in
Hildago -- Mexico has experienced outbreaks in both 2009 and 2010. In
January of 2009, there were 5 outbreaks followed by 15 in February and
18 in March that year. The subsequent 4 months had a total of 16
outbreaks total. In 2010 there were a lower number of outbreaks with 2
in January, 7 in February and 9 in March, with 3 more outbreaks in the
next 2 months.

Certainly with the country's disease history and the fact that both
states had previously been free of disease, it is good that an
aggressive stamping out policy is being put in place. Newcastle
disease can have significant economic effect on commercial poultry
farms and it must be dealt with by strong control and prevention
strategies. Based on the past 2 years, a successful campaign should be
anticipated. The question of the source of new infection remains
unanswered, as is often the case. - Mod.PC]
