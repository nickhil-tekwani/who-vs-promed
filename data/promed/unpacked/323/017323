A contaminated batch of heroin could be behind an outbreak of the
potential killer disease, botulism, among Scots addicts. Health
chiefs issued an urgent warning to addicts today, after 4 cases of
infection were reported.
In Glasgow, 2 men and a woman have been struck down. One man is in
serious condition in the hospital, the woman is recovering in a
different hospital. The other man is described as "clinically well."
Another case is being probed in the Grampian region, although no more
details are known about the person involved. In a similar incident 4
years ago, 23 drug users died across Scotland after being supplied
with a contaminated batch.
The public health protection unit of NHS Greater Glasgow today [27
Oct 2004] confirmed it was investigating the 3 cases in its area. All
3 of the Glasgow victims had evidence of serious infection typical of
injecting straight into the muscle or under the skin.
Dr. Helene Irvine, consultant in public health medicine with NHS
Greater Glasgow, said: "We would warn injecting drug users against
injecting into the muscle -- known as muscle popping -- or under the
skin. This is an extremely dangerous practice, and, in this instance,
is the probable route for the bacterium entering the body. We are
currently working with the police in an attempt to establish whether
the cases became infected due to a batch of heroin that was
contaminated with the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_, which causes
botulism. We are also trying to establish if these cases are linked."
A Strathclyde Police spokeswoman said: "We are trying to trace the
source of this batch of heroin to establish whether it is
contaminated. Inquiries are at an early stage, and we cannot confirm
whether the cases are linked."
Symptoms of botulism include double or blurred vision, drooping eyelids
[similar to a bulbar paralysis - Mod.TG], slurred speech, difficulty in
swallowing, dry mouth, and muscle weakness. If left untreated, the illness
may progress to cause paralysis of the arms, legs, body, heart muscles, and,
finally, death.
In 2000, 23 drug users in Scotland, 18 of them from Glasgow, were
killed by another form of the _Clostridium_ bug, which blackened the
skin and caused liver and kidney failure, after contaminated heroin
circulated in the city. A batch of the drug, which was imported from
Afghanistan, claimed the lives of almost 40 addicts across the UK and
Ireland, with many others treated by casualty units.

[The botulinum toxin produces a postsynaptic paralysis. The paralysis
is a descending paralysis with the 1st signs appearing in the eyes:
droopy eyelids, and, typically, double vision stemming from a lack of
muscular control needed to focus the eyes. Generally, botulism
victims that survive report a dry mouth, but some have been unable to
swallow, and drooling has been apparent.
Without ventilatory assistance, paralysis of the muscles of the
diaphragm, which are responsible for breathing, ultimately lead to
death. - Mod.TG]
