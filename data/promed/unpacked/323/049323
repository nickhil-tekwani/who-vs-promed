Viet Nam has ruled out avian influenza, which has killed more than 40
people in the country, as the cause of last week's deaths of 2 people
who were suspected of having contracted the disease, state newspapers
said on Thu 3 Nov 2005. [See: Avian influenza, human - East Asia
(154): Viet Nam 20051029.3151]. But they said a 25-year-old woman was
in hospital with suspected avian influenza.

The Saigon Giai Phong (Liberation) newspaper quoted Deputy Health
Minister Trinh Quan Huan as reaffirming that Viet Nam had been free
of human infections by the H5N1 virus since August [2005]. "The 2
people who died in Quang Binh province had fever, respiratory
failure, serious pneumonia and viscera failure, but they were not
caused by bird flu," Huan was quoted as telling a government meeting
on Wednesday [2 Nov 2005].

Hospital officials told Reuters a 14-year-old girl and a 26-year-old
man who died last week in Quang Binh, about 500 km (310 miles) south
of Hanoi, had symptoms of bird flu. Huan did not say how the Ministry
has come to such a conclusion, as doctors have said they did not make
any tests.

In Hanoi, the 25-year-old woman was rushed to hospital on Tuesday [1
Nov 2005] with respiratory difficulties and a slight fever, symptoms
of bird flu infection, the Tuoi Tre newspaper said. Tests were under
way to see if she was infected with the H5N1 virus, the newspaper
said, quoting her mother as saying she bought a slaughtered chicken
for a family meal of 4 people but that only her daughter became sick.

On Tuesday, Prime Minister Phan Van Khai issued a directive banning
the making and the sale of raw blood pudding made from poultry or
livestock and prohibited raising poultry in cities, first in Hanoi
and Ho Chi Minh City. But concerns remain about how to reinforce the
ruling given that raw blood pudding -- a traditional special meal
often made from frozen fresh blood, fish sauce and slices of duck or
goose liver -- is popular in the country of 82 million. Ho Chi Minh
City officials said they had ordered farmers to stop raising
chickens, ducks and geese for 4 months starting on 15 Nov 2005.

Avian influenza has infected more than 90 people in Viet Nam and 41
have died since the latest outbreak in Asia began in late 2003. In
Asia, a total of 62 people have died since late 2003 and the World
Health Organisation says H5N1 is now endemic in many poultry flocks
in the region.

Indonesia's health minister said on Thursday [3 Nov 2005] that 3
children are showing symptoms of avian influenza, Elshinta news radio
reported. It said the 3, all under 5 years of age, were being treated
at a hospital in Jakarta and quoted minister Siti Fadillah Supari as
saying they showed such symptoms as high fever, shortness of breath
and signs of viral infection [?]. Asked by a reporter whether test
results had been received, Supari said: "Not yet, maybe in 2 or 3
days hopefully, because this is a holiday, but looking at the
symptoms ... there's a strong possibility that it is avian influenza."

Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, is in the midst
of holidays marking the end of the Islamic fasting month. Supari was
speaking at an event in her home marking the day. The country
registered its 1st confirmed human death from bird flu in July
[2005]. 4 people have died of the disease and 3 have survived.

The disease is widespread among Indonesian's chicken population,
which the agriculture ministry puts at 1.4 billion. Avian influenza
first surfaced in Indonesia in 2003 and has been found in poultry in
23 of its 33 provinces, killing more than 10 million domesticated
birds. Experts have criticised Indonesia for not culling more
poultry, but government officials say that is easier said than done
in a country as vast as Indonesia, with 17 000 islands dotting an
archipelago stretching over some 5000 km (3100 miles). Compounding
the problem are what the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)
estimates at 30 million "backyard chicken" households, accounting for
about 200 million birds. These are homes with just a handful of
birds, many in urban areas. Arranging mass culling under such
circumstances is expensive and impractical. Jakarta officials are
pursuing a multi-faceted approach including vaccination, selective
culling, educating the populace on such topics as avoiding contact
with infected birds, and working with the FAO in defining affected areas.
