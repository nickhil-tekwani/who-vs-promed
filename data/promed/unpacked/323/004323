Researchers have found that the _Shigella_ bacterium that causes severe diarrhea and even deaths in children has developed resistance to the powerful drug, ciprofloxacin. Shigellosis strains have emerged and they are not responding to ciprofloxacin. City doctors say indiscriminate use of antimicrobials has led to the bacteria developing resistance to the powerful drug.

Dr Rajib Paul, critical care specialist, Apollo Hospitals, Jubilee Hills, said the incidence of drug-resistant bacteria is increasing globally and the latest research study on _Shigella_ is a cause for concern. "Strains of _Shigella_ developing resistance to ciprofloxacin is a big blow to the healthcare system. As the burden of drug resistant shigellosis increases, physicians will be left with no choice other than administering injectable drugs for such an easily treatable disease," he said, warning that this will increase healthcare costs.

The caution by city health experts comes in the wake of CDC of USA issuing a warning of emerging strains of _Shigella_ bacteria with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. Incidentally, ciprofloxacin is the main antimicrobial drug used for treatment of shigellosis.

Telangana and AP [Andhra Pradesh] have a high incidence of shigellosis and many cases are referred to tertiary hospitals in Hyderabad as the condition of patients deteriorates. The latest development will affect the treatment protocol as ciprofloxacin is easily available and the bacterial resistance means either delay in the recovery of the patients or high mortality rate. Dr Rajib said it may also lead to a delay in starting treatment, which can lead to further spread of the disease. "It may cause loss of man days as many patients will have to be admitted for treatment," he said.

_Shigella_, along with microbes like rotavirus, _E. coli_, _Salmonella_ and _Campylobacter_, causes severe diarrhea and dysentery in the country. They are transmitted mostly by contaminated water and food. Dr Shaeq Mirza, a general physician, said the incidence of resistance to ciprofloxacin is increasing in Telangana.

[Empiric antimicrobial use for diarrheal illnesses remains common. For self-limited milder bacterial enteric diseases, antimicrobials offer little to the patient except for selection of increasingly resistant microflora and drug reactions. Unless salmonellosis is associated with bacteremia, there is little reason to treat. In patients with no fever and significant abdominal pain with or without blood in the diarrhea, the institution of antimicrobials, if the patient is infected with an enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, could precipitate hemolytic uremic syndrome. Clearly viral diarrhea requires no intervention with antibacterial agents.

In its classic form manifesting as bacterial dysentery ("the bloody flux") with high fever, bloody and mucous containing diarrhea and tenesmus (spasmotic pain when passing the diarrhea), patients are usually hospitalized and empiric antimicrobials begun prior to the confirmation of shigellosis. Withholding therapy in these cases not only may prolong illness but also prolong the infectivity period in this highly transmissible enteric infection. These recommendations relate more to the milder nonhospitalized cases where withholding antimicrobials can be beneficial, not only for the patient but also for public health. - Mod.LL
