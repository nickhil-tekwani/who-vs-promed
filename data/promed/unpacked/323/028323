A study by researcher Luiggi Martini has confirmed that consumption of
raw snails caused an outbreak in the area of La Ercilia, San Eduardo,
Zapotal parish, Ventanas canton, in Los Ríos province. The inquiry by
Martini, an official and former director of the Izquieta Perez
Institute of Hygiene, began after 10 patients were diagnosed with
eosinophilic meningoencephalitis, caused by a parasite found in snails.

The symptoms were: neurological disorders, constipation, vomiting,
nausea, abdominal pain (see graphics in original). The 1st to be
affected were from the coastal province. The provincial director of
Los Rios province, Carlos Paz, confirmed to this newspaper that 10
people had been affected, and another 25-year-old man died [of it] in
the Luis Vernaza hospital of Guayaquil on 22 Jul 2008. Martini
maintains in his 21-page report that this is the 1st record of
infection in rats by the parasite _Angiostrongylus cantonensis_ in
Ecuador and in South America. [Not the 1st for S. America -- see
comment below. - Mod.JW]

According to history, the parasite was 1st described by HT Chen in
1935 and was the 1st rat lungworm. In 1937, another worm was obtained
from a rat in Taiwan, a new species. This infection has also appeared
in Egypt and in Southeast Asia, in Pacific Rim countries such as
Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, and in Hawaii.

On Mon 22 Dec 2008 there was a meeting of all health authorities to
determine what action to take, because the problem also involves
commerce, the export of snails. Paz denied that the species which is
used for human consumption is involved, because only wild-caught
snails were infected. Therefore, the official cautioned that he has
set up an "epidemiological barrier" to prevent spread of the parasite.

Usually, it lives in the pulmonary arteries of rats. Martini does not
know exactly how it came into the country. "It most likely came in
snails imported by the domestic industry. When improperly handled on
farms, they were accessible to wild rats which became infected for the
1st time."

Los Rios is not only affected but also Santo Domingo de las Tsachilas.
The director of the Eugenio Espejo hospital in Quito [the capital],
Marco Ortega, confirmed yesterday that 3 weeks ago 2 people in that
jurisdiction had this health problem. On 18 Nov 2008, 3 people were
visiting an area near Santo Domingo, where they collected at least 3
pounds of snails, which they ate raw with lemon and salt.

Days later, one of them, a 20-year-old man, had abdominal pain, fever
and pain in knees and hips. He was admitted to Eugenio Espejo hospital
on 26 Nov 2008. After 12 days his symptoms worsened, adding slightly
stiff neck and alteration of consciousness. Doctors diagnosed severe
meningitis caused by the parasite, _A. cantonensis_, which lives in
snails. He remains hospitalized.

His brother, aged 17, entered this hospital on 1 Dec 2008, with
similar symptoms. He, according to Flores, ate fewer snails. "He was
discharged 15 days ago and is out of danger," doctors said. "But he
has a lot of pain when walking." The 3rd person was not admitted to
hospital; he had only tasted the flavored juice of the snails.

[These are the 1st human cases of angiostrongyliasis in humans from
Ecuador. All had been eating snails. Previously, the parasite has been
demonstrated in naturally infected snails of various genera and
species in northeastern Brazil, which has also reported cases of
eosinophilic meningitis in the same areas. As is well known, _A.
cantonensis_ has repeatedly been reported as a cause of human disease
in the Caribbean, particularly in Cuba, and reported previously by
ProMED from Dominica, Brazil, and the USA. It is a potential risk in
North and Central America, where there are snails and rodents infected
with the parasite.
