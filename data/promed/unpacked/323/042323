[H7N7 was the influenza serotype which caused an outbreak in the
Netherlands in 2003 occasioning the cull of 255 infected farms and
1094 surrounding poultry farms. It also resulted in human cases in
poultry workers and cullers as characterized in the Eurosurveillance
article referenced below -- see ProMED-mail archive no. 20051221.3649.

Chief Veterinary Officer Nigel Gibbens has today [5 Jun 2008]
confirmed that the strain of avian influenza found on the premises
near Banbury in Oxfordshire is highly pathogenic H7N7. Preliminary
analysis also indicates that this H7N7 strain is likely to be related
to viruses which have occasionally been detected in domestic poultry
and wild birds elsewhere in Europe. Further laboratory tests are in
progress.

The full epidemiological investigation and tracings of any dangerous
contacts are underway, and all possible sources of the outbreak will
be investigated.

The Health Protection Agency has confirmed that the risk to public
health remains low. Following confirmation of the virus subtype as
H7N7, the Agency has reviewed current procedures based on the best
evidence available. They remain confident that all necessary steps are
being taken to protect those people who may have been exposed to the
virus on the premises or involved in disease control activities.

Protection and Surveillance Zones have replaced the Temporary Control
Zone established on 3 Jun 2008 around the premises in Oxfordshire. The
restrictions that applied in the Temporary Control Zone remain in
place. Further information on the animal health aspects of avian
influenza and current restrictions is available on the Defra website
at <http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2008/http://www.defra.gov.uk/>.
Farmers are urged to be vigilant and report signs of disease to a
private vet or to local Animal Health.

Information on public health aspects is available at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2008/http://www.hpa.org.uk/>.

Notes to editors

- All avian influenza viruses are categorized according to the ability
to cause severe disease (pathogenicity) in avian species as either
highly pathogenic viruses or low pathogenic.

- Viruses consist of proteins. Avian influenza viruses are classified
using the H and N proteins. There are 16 different H proteins and 9 N
proteins, and any combination of these is possible. The H5 and H7 are
considered to be the most important from an animal health perspective.

Following confirmation of the avian influenza virus subtype as H7N7,
the Health
Protection Agency has reviewed actions taken in the Oxfordshire
poultry farm outbreak.

Based on the best evidence available from national flu experts, the
agency remains confident that all necessary steps are being taken to
protect those people who may have been exposed to the virus on the
premises or who are involved in disease control activities.

Director of the Thames Valley Health Protection Unit, Dr Elizabeth
Haworth, said: "H7 avian flu remains largely a disease in birds which
does not transmit easily to humans. The disease on the Oxfordshire
poultry farm was identified at an early stage, and the agency has been
actively involved in assessing the risk and providing help and
support, including ensuring all people who needed post exposure
treatment with antiviral agents and seasonal flu vaccine received this
and that those involved in disease control activities also received
appropriate treatment before starting work.

We have also set up enhanced surveillance of people exposed to
infected poultry, checking daily for any symptoms of illness which may
emerge even though the risk to humans remains very low."

Professor Nigel Lightfoot, Head of Influenza Programmes at the Health
Protection Agency, said: "Despite this occurrence, the current level
of risk to humans from avian flu is very low. Most human H7 infections
so far have occurred through direct contact with live or dead infected
poultry. However, any possibility of exposure to the virus is taken
very seriously, and the local Health Protection Unit is working
closely with Defra and Animal Health to ensure that all the necessary
steps are being taken to protect those people who may have been
exposed to the virus on the premises or who are involved in disease
control activities."

Notes to editors:

Avian influenza, or "bird flu," is a contagious disease of birds
caused by viruses that normally only infect wild birds and, rarely,
other species including domestic poultry. When a strain is identified
as being "highly pathogenic," this refers to the implications for
birds, not for humans. The risk to human health is very low for this
strain.

[The identification of HPAI H7N7 as the causative agent of this
outbreak may allow a (moderate) caution regarding its public health
aspects. Fortunately, however, this strain has been known to be far
less pathogenic to humans than the infamous H5N1 virus, which has been
circulating on 3 continents since 2003.

During the massive outbreak of H7N7 in the Netherlands in 2003, 31
million birds had to be culled. One human case involved fatal
respiratory distress syndrome in a veterinarian who was in close
contact with infected poultry. Reportedly, 86 cases in poultry workers
and 3 cases in people with no poultry contact were initially confirmed
by PCR. Dutch researchers later discovered that a considerable number
of people who worked with sick chickens had antibodies to the virus.
It was also suspected that some of the seropositive humans did not
have direct contact with the infected birds. However, clinical
manifestations were uncommon, in most cases, only self-limiting
conjunctivitis.

MacKenzie: "UK gets the safe kind of bird flu - maybe;" at

An immediate notification from UK's CVO, submitted 5 Jun 2008 to the
OIE, provided the following information:

"Affected Population: Laying flock of _Gallus gallus_.

Susceptible: 25 000; Cases: 15 000; Deaths: 10 000; Destroyed: 15 000.

Epidemiological comments: 1st noted 2 weeks ago with mild clinical
disease. Marked clinical disease in 2 sheds was then observed on 31
May 2008. Epidemiological investigation is in progress."

Information about the genetic lineage of the current virus will help
in assessing its further animal and public health implications.
Though one is obliged to assume that the affected chickens were kept
outside (free range?!), firsthand data are preferable. - Mod.AS]
