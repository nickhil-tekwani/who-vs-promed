Growing Rabies Concerns in Franklin County
------------------------------------------
A rabies control officer is being treated for rabies exposure less than 2
weeks after a teenage boy died from the virus [see report below]. Another
bat with rabies has surfaced in Franklin County. The question is, did the
bat infect the last man to touch it? Parents and one man who handles
animals every day are on edge. "When I knocked the bat off, he came right
down and scraped across my arm." In his 23 years on the job, the rabies
control officer has never come so uncomfortably close to rabies.
Franklin County's rabies control officer is getting treatment after
handling a bat that was, in his words, "red hot" with rabies. On Wednesday
night [11 Sep 2002], a Franklin County resident pulled a bat from her pool.
"And the reason I called the hospital is because I was scared. I'd heard
about the little boy who had died," she said. She has insisted the bat be
shipped to a laboratory for testing. The same rabies test will be done on
the head of a skunk turned over to the rabies control officer on Thursday
by a concerned homeowner. This rise in rabies awareness can be attributed
to the death of the 13-year-old boy, who died on 31 Aug 2002 after being
bitten by a bat, which his father said the teenager carried home from a
fishing trip.
Rabies is 100 percent treatable if it's caught in time, but nearly always
fatal once symptoms arise. Experts say the best medicine is prevention.
"Don't pick up dead animals. Don't mess with any live, wild animals. Just
stay away. Go away from them," said a Franklin County executive. He stated
that Franklin County has never had a rabies outbreak of this magnitude, but
he stopped short of calling it an epidemic. He said the county is trying to
educate the public that even the most seasoned animal handlers are not immune.
The 13-year-old boy's death is only the second in Tennessee since 1955. His
father said his son denied, repeatedly, he'd been bitten by the bat. The
health department said you can get bitten and not even know it. Parents are
urged to talk to their children.

Winchester Boy Dies from Rabies Thought to Be From Bat Bite
-------------------------------------------------
A Franklin County boy has died from rabies that family members suspect he
contracted from a bat 2-1/2 months ago. The 13-year-old Winchester boy died
on Sat 31 Aug 2002 at Vanderbilt University Medical Center; the first human
rabies death in the state in 8 years, health officials say. He was taken to
Vanderbilt on 25 Aug 2002 when doctors at the Southern Tennessee Medical
Center in Winchester could not determine what was wrong with him, said his
stepfather. The boy had complained of high fever and severe headaches. His
stepfather said he believes his stepson was infected in mid-June 2002. "He
went fishing, which was walking distance from our home," he said. "On his
way back, he came across a bat and picked it up and brought it into the
house." He said he didn't know his stepson had the live bat in the home for
2 or 3 hours. It was released back into the woods.
Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of Vanderbilt's department of preventative
medicine, said the testing procedure takes time. First a specimen is sent
to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, then
results are sent back to the hospital. Schaffner said anyone who has
contact with wild animals -- especially bats, skunks, raccoons, or foxes --
should see a doctor or call the public health department. "Bats apparently
are special because they can bite you and you might not be aware of it
because their teeth are so tiny," he said.

[The evidence in this case for contraction of rabies by the handling of a
captive bat is circumstantial. However, in the United States 24 (74
percent) of 32 cases since 1990 have been attributed to bat-associated
variants of rabies virus, notwithstanding the fact that history of a bite
was established in only 2 cases. Although bat rabies virus variants can be
transmitted secondarily from terrestrial mammals, the lack of other
animal-bite histories and the rarity of bat rabies virus variants found in
terrestrial mammals suggest that this means of transmission is rare.
The following advice is taken from the MMWR report referenced below.
Although rabies is usually transmitted by a bite, persons may minimize the
medical implications of a bat bite. Unlike bites from larger animals, the
trauma of a bat bite is unlikely to warrant seeking medical care. Unless
the potential for rabies exposure is known to the patient, rabies
post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) will not be received. In all cases where
bat-human contact has occurred or is suspected, the bat should be collected
and tested for rabies. If the bat is unavailable, the need for PEP should
be assessed by public health officials. PEP should be considered after
direct contact between a human and a bat, unless the exposed person can be
certain a bite, scratch, or mucous membrane exposure did not occur. PEP may
be considered for persons who were in the same room as a bat and who might
be unaware that a bite or direct contact had occurred (e.g., when a
sleeping person wakes to find a bat in the room or an adult witnesses a bat
in the room with an unattended child, mentally disabled person, or
intoxicated person). PEP is not warranted when direct contact between a
human and a bat did not occur. Seeing a bat or being in the vicinity of
bats does not constitute an exposure. - Mod.CP]
