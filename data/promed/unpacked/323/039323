In Hanzhong city of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, 2 more people
have died of rabies bringing the rabies death toll in the city since
March [2009] to 11. The 2 fatalities were both women, one aged 58 and
the other 56, said a local government official.

The 1st death was reported on 21 Mar [2009], and number of people
injured by dog bites in the city has since reached 6256. So far,
approximately 335 900 pet dogs have been vaccinated in the city, said
the local government official. The city, with more than 370 000
registered dogs, reported 35 deaths of rabies from 1985 to 1992.

Human deaths indicated the rabies virus was very active, posing a
great public health threat, Shi Ruihua, local agricultural bureau
chief, said earlier this month [June 2009]. The city carried out a
rabies prevention campaign from 23 May-1 Jun [2009], implementing
door-to-door compulsory vaccinations of dogs and urging dog owners to
put their pets on a leash or keep them off the streets.
