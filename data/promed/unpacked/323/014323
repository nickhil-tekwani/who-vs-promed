As of 2 Jul [2015], 64 laboratory-confirmed cases of tickborne [virus] infectious have been recorded on the Rostov region. Among them there are 61 cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever [CCHF], which were recorded in 21 administrative territories of the region and 3 cases of Lyme disease in the town of Kamensk-Shakhtinsky.

Infection occurs through tick bites, contracted during the care of farm animals (removal with bare hands, crushing). Tick bites can be painless and therefore imperceptible to humans.

[The Rostov region is endemic for CCHF. Last year (2014) in the region 54 CCHF cases were recorded. During the 1st 2 weeks, the number of people who contracted CCHF increased to 11. Warm weather with high humidity supports significant levels of tick activity. - Mod.NP

The Rostov region is endemic for CCHF virus. The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people active in the outdoors where there are ticks, as well as those involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.

Almost 30 inhabitants of the Stavropol region contracted CCHF
-------------------------------------------------------------
High activity of ticks -- vectors of infectious diseases -- continue to be recorded in the Stavropol region.

As of 30 Jun [2015], 6232 people sought medical aid in connection for tick bites, being 35.6 per cent more than in the same period last year [2014]. Moreover, there has been a 40 per cent increase in the number of children bitten by ticks.

Since the beginning of the epidemic season, 29 cases of CCHF have been reported in the rural population of Apanasenkovskij, Arzgirsky, Blagodarnensky, Budennovsky, Grachevsky, Ipatovsky, Krasnogvardeisky, Kursky, levakumsky, Neftekumsky, Novoselsky, Petrovsky and Turkmen districts.

According to scientists, the risk of acquiring tickborne infections in the region remains high, and all the 26 districts of the region are areas of CCHF risk.

[The current epidemic season is unfavorable for CCHF [risk] in the south of Russia due to high humidity and warm (but not hot) weather, which leads to significant tick activity. The number of people who contracted CCHF in 2015 in several regions of Russia already exceeds the total for 2014. In the Stavropol region last year (2014), about 27 cases of CCHF were reported; this year there are already 29, and in the Rostov region there are now 61 cases versus 54 cases in 2014. - Mod.NP

CCHF is endemic and occurs frequently in the Stavropol region. ProMED-mail reports multiple cases nearly every year (see archives listed below).

2 residents Paiariksky and Khuzhailiksky districts of Samarkand region have been transferred to Tashkent with suspicion of CCHF to undergo medical examination.

Last year [2014], a patient with CCHF was recorded in the Turtkul district of the Karakalpakstan region.

In August 2013 CCHF spread in the Hegelism district of the Karakalpakstan region, and 10 people died, reported radio Ozodlik.

[This is the 1st report about CCHF in Uzbekistan. We have no information as to whether CCHF was confirmed or not. Uzbekistan is adjacent to the southern region of Kazakhstan that is endemic for CCHF. - Mod.NP

Dr Jan Clement pointed out in an earlier post (archive no. 20150309.3217736) that proper isolation of this CHF-virus (CHFV) failed early on until it finally succeeded in June 1967 in the lab of the renowned Russian virologist Mikhael Chumakov, from a fatal case that occurred however, not in the Crimea, but in Samarkand (now Uzbekistan), far from the Crimea.
