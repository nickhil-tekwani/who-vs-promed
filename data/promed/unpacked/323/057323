Last year [2014] the number of patients with diseases transmitted by wild rodents more than tripled compared to previous years. This mostly involves leptospirosis, 97 patients last year instead of the average of 30.

The National Institute for Public Health and Environment, the RIVM, and the Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority, the NVWA, announced this on [Tue 3 Nov 2015].

The bacterium that causes leptospirosis is found in rodents such as mice and rats. When an infected rat urinates in surface water, the water can become contaminated and then infect humans. For example, when they swim in open water. Symptoms of leptospirosis can vary widely from flu-like symptoms to severe kidney and liver disease.

According to the 2 organizations, the cause of the increase in rodent transmitted diseases is not entirely clear, but the mild winter and hot summer likely played the role. The organizations are not too worried about the situation, because the number of patients is limited.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonosis caused by one of the many pathogenic serotypes of the spirochete _Leptospira_. It is transmitted to humans by exposure of abraded skin or mucous membranes to water or wet soil (such as after flooding due to heavy rainfall) that has been contaminated by urine from asymptomatic chronically infected animals, especially rodents. Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for rat infestation in urban settings.
