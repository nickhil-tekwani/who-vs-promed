The head of the Denver Rescue Mission says a failure to follow food handling procedures lead to the poisoning of 60 people Sunday night, 22 Jul 2012.

"We conducted our own investigation," said Brad Meuli, the rescue mission's president and CEO. "It became apparent that some pre-prepared food that had been delivered here had not been handled correctly."

Meuli wouldn't say where the food came from or how it was mishandled, citing a desire not to interfere with the health department's ongoing investigation. When asked whether it was an oversight issue, a training issue, or whether handlers just got in too big of a hurry, Meuli replied: "It could have been a combination of all of those things. The bottom line is that we didn't do the procedures that we should have for pre-prepared food."

Meuli told 7NEWS that 340 meals were served Friday [20 Jul 2012] night. The menu included turkey, mashed potatoes and gravy, stuffing and a salad. Mission officials would not speculate on which item may have caused the food poisoning.

One woman who ate there Sunday [22 Jul 2012] night told 7NEWS that she ate turkey and didn't get sick. She said she didn't have potatoes, dressing or salad. Others say the focus of the investigation is on the turkey. Environmental Health officials aren't commenting about the food poisoning, other than to say that the case is still under investigation.

Denver Environmental Public Health Program Manager Danica Lee told 7NEWS that nonprofits are not inspected regularly like restaurants. When asked whether the mass food poisoning will lead to a change in policy, Lee replied: "This instance has prompted us to look at that, to see if we allocated our resources where we need to, and whether we need to divert resources to do regular inspections of nonprofits."

Lee said the food poisoning investigation should be complete next week. "These folks that we serve are our friends and neighbors. They are people we love. The last thing we want to do is hurt them."

Meuli said the Lawrence shelter is no longer serving pre-prepared meals. All the other shelters run by the mission are operating normally, including the distribution of food to partner agencies.

The Denver Rescue Mission provides 600 000 meals annually. Meuli said the mission will continue providing meals, shelter, clothing and medical care to those in need.

Although the exact symptoms of the "violent illness" are not stated in the article, if vomiting predominated, then _Bacillus cereus_ should be a top suspect, as it can cause vomiting within 1-5 hours after ingestion.
