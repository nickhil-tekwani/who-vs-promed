Asian elephants in North America are becoming sick and some are dying from
human tuberculosis (TB) bacteria. Treating the animals has proven
difficult, but veterinarians report some successes.
In 1996, TB, one of the leading infectious diseases in the world, was found
in 2 circus elephants traveling through Los Angeles County. The discovery
alarmed veterinarians and sparked a wave of research now indicating the
cases were more of a trend than a fluke.
Since then, 18 cases have been found, including 4 in California. This has
prompted researchers to conclude the human TB bacterium, _Mycobacterium
tuberculosis_, is emerging as a threat to North America's aging Asian
elephants, a species already inching toward extinction in the wild because
of its increasing proximity to man.
The cases, which involved about 3.3% of the captive population, are a vivid
example of how a human disease can be transmitted to animals. Some
diseases, such as rabies and certain types of influenza, have been known to
jump between animals and humans, according to Dr. Richard Montali, the
chief veterinary pathologist at the Smithsonian National Zoological Park in
Washington, D.C.
As for human TB, though it has been found in a range of species, it is not
common for it to be transmitted to elephants. The 2 elephants in 1996 had
been coughing, and one had lost hundreds of pounds, both classic signs of
the disease, said Dr. C. Patrick Ryan, a veterinarian most recently with
the Department of Health Services in Los Angeles County, where one of the
elephants died. The second elephant died on the trip home to Illinois.
Researchers think many of the infected animals were exposed in their Asian
homelands, where most were born, or while in close contact with infected
handlers in zoos and circuses in North America. "The elephants got it from
humans somewhere along the line," said Dr. Susan Mikota, a veterinarian
with the Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species in New Orleans.
Using DNA fingerprinting, scientists at the U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA) have identified 5 distinct strains of human TB in 8 different
elephant groups in California, Illinois, Arkansas, Florida and
Missouri. The USDA recommends elephants with the active disease be treated
with the same drugs used on humans. Treatment costs about $50 000 per
animal and treatment is recommended for at least a year.
The researchers' findings appeared in a recent issue of the journal Zoo
Biology. The review paper was authored by Mikota, Montali and Dr. R. Scott
Larsen, a veterinarian at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. Most
of the infected elephants have been privately owned -- by circuses,
concessionaires and others, Mikota said. Among the 4 cases diagnosed in
zoo elephants are one at the Los Angeles Zoo and another at the San
Francisco Zoo.
The disease may be more prevalent in performing animals because of their
mobility, she said. There has been contact between the elephants in the 8
groups affected; researchers at this point don't know if the infected
animals are transmitting the disease back to humans. "It is more of a
movement issue rather than a facilities issue," Mikota said. TB is not an
easy bug to catch and it is not transmitted by casual contact. However,
elephants typically greet one another by breathing into each other's trunks
and often solicit a similar greeting from their keepers. Handlers,
therefore, are considered at the greatest risk, Mikota said.
Spectators typically are not close to circus and zoo elephants long enough
to be considered at serious risk. Human TB "is pretty contagious under the
right conditions with people," Montali said, "and there are great degrees
of susceptibility among a whole span of mammals." It has been found in a
range of animals, from non-human primates to parrots, he said. "It may
have evolved in elephants over the years with their close exposure to man."
Human TB is rarely found among African elephants and has not been
identified in elephants in the wild, which leads researchers to believe it
primarily is a human disease and elephants are accidental hosts. "I'm much
more concerned about people bringing TB to elephants than elephants giving
TB to people," said Dr. William Lindsay, director of veterinary care for
Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, which owns about 70 Asian
elephants, the largest group in North America.
Ringling's Center for Elephant Conservation, a breeding farm in Polk
County, Florida, and its retirement center in Williston, Florida has had 8
elephants diagnosed with human TB, Lindsay said. TB, a potentially fatal
disease, initially attacks the lungs, spreads through the air, usually when
an infected individual coughs or sneezes. From the lungs, the bacteria can
move through the bloodstream to other parts of the body, such as the
kidneys, spine and brain. However, most infected individuals never develop
the disease, and the organism can remain inactive for a lifetime, said
Montali, the Smithsonian pathologist.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there
were 17 531 human cases reported in the United States last year, of which
3606 were in California.
Worldwide, Asian elephants are considered endangered and are rarely
imported into the US. Their wild population has plunged to about 40 000
from more than 100 000 in 1900, mainly because of conflicts with man, with
whom the elephants compete for land. About 285 elephants live in captivity
in North America today.
Today's TB cases are not unprecedented. The disease was described in
elephants more than 2000 years ago, and cases were reported intermittently
throughout the 20th century, Mikota said. However, it was not until 1998
the USDA established guidelines requiring all elephants to be screened
yearly for the disease, and treatment protocols were set up. The
guidelines also recommended handlers be tested yearly.
Treatment, however, has been a challenge. Some animals must be trained to
accept medication orally and rectally; all must be able to tolerate the
frequent testing and collection of blood samples to determine drug levels.
Calle, an Asian elephant transferred to the San Francisco Zoo from the Los
Angeles Zoo, was diagnosed in 1997, before the USDA guidelines were in
place. (TB was found in another elephant that died at the Los Angeles Zoo
in 1997.) Calle was treated with human drugs -- isoniazid, rifampin,
pyrazinamide -- in doses based on the formula used to treat people, said
Dr. Freeland Dunker, zoo veterinarian.
However, animals absorb drugs differently than humans, and the dosages had
to be adjusted and readjusted. "It took 6 months and 21 formulations until
we found something that would be absorbed," Dunker said. But soon the
pills made Calle sick, and she refused to take the medicine.
A Berkeley pharmacist concocted 2-pound cocoa-butter suppositories in which
to plant the powdered drugs, Dunker said. It did the trick. It ended up
costing about $72 000 to treat Calle, not including personnel expenses, he
said.
Some elephants have been asymptomatic. Others have shown signs of chronic
weight loss or diminished appetites, or have developed coughs or an
intolerance to exercise. With so few cases nationwide, "we can develop
trends and ideas about how this works," Montali said, "but
epidemiologically we're just beginning to understand it. We're not at the
point where we can draw conclusions, but the learning curve is going up
rapidly."
