South Africa: Influenza A Virus Outbreak in Adult Residential College
--------------------------------------------------
Of the approximately 2000 students at the college, approximately 600
have developed an influenza-like syndrome with fever, myalgia, and
lethargy. 25 cases have required hospitalisation either with
pneumonia or severe myalgia. One case of influenza A virus pneumonia
has been diagnosed according to the treating ID specialist. The same
specialist revealed that CK [creatine kinase] levels were "unusually
high" in many victims. Influenza A virus was identified by rapid
testing. Strain identification is awaited.
The outbreak commenced on 28 May 2003. Victims were not immunised
prior to the outbreak. College students who have not fallen ill are
being administered amantadine and vaccination.
