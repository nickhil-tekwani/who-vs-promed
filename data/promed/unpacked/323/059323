-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
_Fig mosaic virus_ (FMV) (genus _Emaravirus_, family Fimoviridae) is considered the etiological agent of fig mosaic disease (FMD) recorded in most of the fig-growing areas with an average global infection rate of 33%. FMD-like symptoms, which include mosaic, chlorotic ringspots, and oak leaf patterns, were observed in approximately 1/3 of 400 fig accessions in Yalta Botanical Gardens [southern Crimean Peninsula].

Symptomatic leaves of 59 32-year-old trees representing 31 local and 27 introduced _Ficus carica_ cultivars and a single _F. pseudocarica_ tree were tested by RT-PCR amplifying a 302-bp fragment of RNA1 and a 468-bp fragment of RNA2 [of FMV]. PCR products of the expected sizes were generated in all samples, indicating a high FMV incidence in the plantings.

The genome sequences of FMV isolates from _F. carica_ cvs. Bleuet, Kraps di Hersh, Smena, Temri, and _F. pseudocarica_ were determined. In each of 5 samples, analysis found [sequences which] spanned 99-100% of corresponding genomic segments of the most closely related [FMV] isolates. Five Russian isolates shared 99.2-100% nucleotide sequence identity, depending on the genomic segment. Phylogenetic analysis showed that [parts of] the Russian isolates clustered with FMV isolates from Italy, Japan, [or] Serbia. Incongruency of phylogenetic relationship among the genomic segments suggests reassortment among ancestors of the Russian FMV isolates.

This is the 1st report of FMV in Russia. This finding not only expands the information on the geographical distribution of FMV, but also extends knowledge on _F. pseudocarica_ as a natural host of the virus. In addition to FMV, _Fig cryptic virus_-related [sequences] were also detected in some samples.

[Fig mosaic disease (FMD) is considered the main disease affecting cultivated edible figs (_Ficus carica_) worldwide. _Fig mosaic virus_ (FMV; genus _Emaravirus_) has been reported as the causal agent. However, around 15 additional viruses and viroids (including _Fig cryptic virus_, FCV, mentioned above) have also been found to be associated with FMD forming disease complexes in different regions. FMD symptoms on leaves may include mild mottling, large yellow patches, oak leaf or ring spot patterns, reduced size, or deformation. On affected trees, premature defoliation or fruit drop may occur.

FMV is spread by the eriophyid mite _Aceria fici_ with a transmission rate of up to 70%. Like most of the viruses and viroids associated with FMD, it can also be transmitted by grafting and with infected propagation material. FLV mentioned above is also seed transmissible. Disease management of FMV and other FMD pathogens mostly relies on phytosanitation, such as removal of infected plants and disinfection of orchard tools. Use of certified clean planting material (including tissue cultures, rootstocks, and scions for grafting) is essential.
