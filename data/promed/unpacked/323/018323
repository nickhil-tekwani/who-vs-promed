Canadian Food Inspection Agency - Narrative background to Canada's
assessment of and response to the BSE occurrence in Alberta
[It is a very dense and honest report on their investigations, which
unfortunately does not have a summary, which one could then quote. The
investigation has a number of dimensions:
Micro: Animal Health Aspects
Micro: Feed Aspects
Macro-Retrospective: Animal Health Aspects
Macro-Retrospective: Feed Aspects
Macro: Current
Using DNA identification of the index cow they were able to focus on
specific herds and narrow the resulting eradication procedures. In total,
15 premises were quarantined as part of the tracing-back and
tracing-forward investigations. An additional 25 herds were scrutinized in
the tracing-out of single animals or cohorts from the primary line of
enquiry, which included the identification and notification of the export
of five animals to the U.S. in 1997. This resulted in the culling of more
than 2700 cattle. Among them, the more than 2000 animals 24 months of age
or older were tested and found negative to both Prionics western blot and
immunohistochemistry techniques.
By careful study, the destination of the index animal as pet food and
poultry meal was found to be to some 1800 farm sites. The feed survey
indicated that 99 percent of sites experienced either no exposure (96
percent), incidental (3 percent), or varied (1 percent) --- leaking mixer,
sheep with fence-row access to swine feed, a feed pile break-in by cattle,
and a goat with access to a feed bag. The exposure of 63 cattle to poultry
feed could not be ruled out, and they were culled and tested negative.
Owing to the slow nature of this disease, quick and easy answers are
impossible. The CFIA do not come up with any hard and easy answers as to
how it originated, but a number of questions are posed, among them why the
disease was not first expressed in dairy animals; that the prior import
cohort of UK cattle would have entered Alberta feed system in greater
volume than elsewhere in Canada and the possibility of the prions cycling
unseen and the risk of their extending through animal exports into
northwestern USA; and whether its index appearance is related to the fact
that 99 percent of Canadian cattle imports are from the USA.
Members are encouraged to read the full report.
Because of the uncertainty of the situation, the Canadian press has rather
jumped on the speculative US source hypothesis. This weekend the Canadian
Finance Minister John Manley said Canada might restrict American cattle
imports if the U.S. doesn't soon lift a ban on Canadian beef, which was
imposed over concerns about mad cow disease. Canada exports about C$3.5
billion ($2.6 billion) worth of cattle and beef to the U.S. annually, while
it imports about C$500 million of these products from the U.S.. The present
restrictions on Canadian beef are crippling the industry in the western
provinces and if not relaxed soon, widespread bankruptcies will follow. See
