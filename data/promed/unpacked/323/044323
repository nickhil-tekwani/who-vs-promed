Bird die-off disease strain identified
--------------------------------------
A virulent strain of Newcastle disease is responsible for the death
of nearly 1000 gulls and 500 cormorants in Minnesota this summer
[2010]. The specific strain of Newcastle disease was confirmed this
week by the National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin.

The practical implication of this finding is that Minnesota poultry
producers should practice sound biosecurity procedures, including the
monitoring of their poultry flocks for signs of illness and taking
steps to prevent wild birds from having contact with their flocks.

Newcastle disease has not yet been detected in Minnesota's poultry
flocks. If birds show clinical signs suggestive of this disease,
producers should immediately contact their veterinarian or the Board
of Animal Health. Similarly, cormorants, gulls and pelicans suspected
to have the disease should be reported to the local Department of
Natural Resources (DNR) area wildlife office.

Cormorant and gull die-off occurred earlier this summer on Marsh Lake
in Big Stone County and Wells Lake in Rice County and in recent days
sick and dead cormorants have been discovered at Leech Lake in Cass
County. Additionally, the National Wildlife Health Center is
conducting tests on dead cormorants, gulls and pelicans collected
from Lake Vermillion and Lake of the Woods. To date, all dead birds
have tested negative for the avian influenza virus.

A viral avian disease, Newcastle rarely affects humans. When it does
affect humans it generally causes a relatively mild pink eye.

Newcastle Disease is not new to Minnesota. The last virulent outbreak
of this disease occurred in 2008, when about 2400 birds died at 8
different locations. State officials ensure that dead birds are
buried or incinerated.

[Newcastle disease virus was suspected in an earlier post. So this
seems to provide some confirmation of the disease, and is not avian
influenza. Readers are referred to ProMED-mail 20100807.2692 for more
information on this disease. - Mod.TG]
