According to FOX News
<http://www.foxnews.com/health/wires2/0513/h_rt_0513_19.sml>
the influenzavirus vaccine developed for the 1998-1999 influenza season was
well matched to the strains of influenzaviruses circulating in the U.S.
but
according to Newsday
<http://www.newsday.com/ap/rnmphs0n.htm>
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the US
influenza season was apparently deadlier than usual this year.
