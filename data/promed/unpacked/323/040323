A comment in response to ProMED-mail Measles - Canada (02): Toronto
20080413.1341
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Canadian experience with measles and measles vaccine (both live
and killed) is quite different than that in the USA. The reasons for
considering persons born in Canada prior to 1970 as naturally immune
to measles are:

1. Live measles vaccine was approved for use in Canada in 1963;
2. Killed measles vaccine was widely used in Ontario and some other
provinces up to 1970;
3. Live measles vaccine was not provided free in most provinces until
1970 for use at 1 year of age and at school entry;
4. The incidence of measles did not fall significantly until after 1970.

Therefore, adults born before 1970 were likely to have been infected
with wild measles virus.
