Rabies Transmission Through Organ Donation
------------------------------------------
Great precautions are taken to avoid disease transmission through
transplantation, but a small risk always remains: 3 patients in
Germany may have caught rabies through an organ donation from a
deceased woman who was probably infected with the disease. The
Deutsche Stiftung Organtransplantation (DSO, German Organ
Transplantation Foundation; Federal Organ Procurement Agency) regrets
that this could have happened, although all necessary care has been
taken, and the donor underwent all medically indicated examinations
before her organs were removed.
In Neu-Isenburg the DSO announces that 3 patients suspected of having
rabies may have been infected through organ transplants (lungs,
combined kidney/pancreas, and kidney) performed in 3 German
transplant centers (Hanover, Marburg, Hannovers Muenden) at the end
of 2004. These 3 recipients have been hospitalized with suspected
rabies and are in extremely critical condition. 3 other patients who
received the liver and the corneas from the same donor and who were
transplanted in Heidelberg and Mainz are well.
The organ donor had no symptoms of rabies. She was a young woman who
was hospitalized in December 2004. She suffered a cardiac arrest that
led to brain death due to a lack of oxygen despite resuscitation
measures that transiently stabilized her circulation.
"This has never happened before in Germany," said Professor Guenter
Kirste from the Board of the DSO. "We know of a case of rabies
transmission via organ donation that occurred in the USA last summer.
Unfortunately, such rare infections cannot be excluded beforehand in
the organ donation process despite rigorous donor screening
procedures. A small degree of risk through rare infections is always
present in organ transplantation." He also emphasized that this
[regrettable] case should not [cause us to] forget that organ
transplants are a well-established therapeutic option with undoubted
benefits that by far outweigh the risks.
Tests to confirm the diagnosis of rabies in the organ donor are
currently under way in the rabies laboratory of the Institute of
Virology of Essen University Medical Center and at the Bernhard Nocht
Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg.
Rabies is typically transmitted to humans through bites of an
infected animal. Transmission through skin injuries or through direct
contact with the infectious material (such as saliva) with mucous
membranes is also possible. Anecdotal cases of human-to-human
transmission through transplantation are documented -- but no such
case has occurred in Germany before. As a precaution, all staff
members of the transplant centers, the hospitals, and the DSO who
were involved in the organ donation process and potentially exposed
to rabies through contact with the donor and the recipients received
active and passive immunization.
"The risk of catching rabies in Germany is very low," said Dr. Andrea
Koch, head of the Department of Infectious Epidemiology of the Robert
Koch Institute in Berlin. The last 2 deaths from rabies in Germany
occurred in 1996 and 2004, and both patients caught the disease
abroad. Usually, all individuals assumed to have been exposed to an
animal infected with rabies are vaccinated, which successfully
prevents the onset of the disease. Information on rabies can be found

Suspected rabies transmission through organ donation confirmed
--------------------------------------------------------------
The Institute of Virology in Essen and Bernhard Nocht Institute for
Tropical Medicine in Hamburg confirm diagnosis of rabies in organ
donor
The Deutsche Stiftung Organ-transplantation (DSO, German Organ
Transplantation Foundation; Federal Organ Procurement Agency)
confirms that the organ donor whose organs were transplanted into 6
patients in Germany early in 2005 actually had rabies. The
preliminary diagnosis was confirmed by histological and immunological
tests performed in brain tissue from the donor at the Bernhard Nocht
Institute for Tropical Medicine. "There is no doubt about the
diagnosis," said Professor Dr. Herbert Schmitz, head of the
Department of Virology of the Bernhard Nocht Institute, "the tissue
specimens examined yielded definitive evidence." This was also
confirmed by the head of the Institute of Virology, Professor Dr.
Michael Roggendorf.
In 2 of the patients who received organs from this donor, the rabies
virus was isolated by means of molecular biological tests. It is thus
obvious that these recipients have been infected. In another
recipient, the neutralization test identified rabies-specific
antibodies. This result may also be due to an earlier exposure to the
virus and thus does not provide clear-cut evidence of an acute rabies
infection.
Regrets were expressed by Professor Dr. Guenter Kirste, Board of the
DSO. He also emphasized that despite the public concern about this
case, "the anonymity of the donor and her relatives must be strictly
preserved. We must not forget that organ donation is a generous gift
and that the donor is definitely not to blame for this unfortunate
situation."

Transplant-mediated rabies infection
-------------------------------------
[A statement communicated by Prof. Helmut Fickenscher, on behalf of
M. Buechler, J. Encke, H. Fickenscher, H. Geiss, T. Kraus, P. Sauer,
J. Schmidt, W. Stremmel, J. Werner, University of Heidelberg; M.
Roggendorf, R.S. Ross, B. Wolters, University of Essen; and T.
Mueller, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Wusterhausen].

As reported previously [see: Rabies, human, organ transplantation -
Germany 20050217.0530], a transplant donor whose death had been
attributed to acute cerebral ischemia has now been identified to have
been infected with rabies. On 1 Jan 2005, and during several days
thereafter, 6 patients received transplants of kidney,
kidney/pancreas, lung, liver, and corneas, respectively. Whereas the
patients with kidney, pancreas, and lung transplants developed
encephalitis within 6 weeks, the cornea patients and the patient with
liver transplantation at the University Hospital in Heidelberg are
clinically doing fine.
Immediately after the information about the probable rabies infection
of the donor reached us, the liver transplant recipient was
readmitted in the early morning of 15 Feb 2005, and a combined
active/passive rabies immunization was administered. On the same day,
a combination therapy with ribavirin and pegylated interferon was
started. The diagnostic procedures have been performed at the
National Reference Center for Rabies at the University of Essen and
the OIE Reference Laboratory for Rabies at Wusterhausen, Germany.
Surprisingly, high levels of anti-rabies antibodies have been
detected by both ELISA and neutralization tests and the specificity
was confirmed by western blot analysis. Initial tests for nucleic
acids have been negative up to now.
Thus, whereas 3 other patients are in critical condition, the liver
transplant patient at Heidelberg Medical Center appears to be
protected from rabies. There are anamnestic hints that the patient
may have received a rabies vaccination in childhood. It is
conceivable that the transplantation of the rabies-infected liver may
have boosted this preexisting immune response, producing high titers
of neutralizing antibodies. This hypothesis is currently being
checked by testing a pre-transplantation serum sample.
