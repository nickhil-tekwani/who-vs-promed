Animal cases of avian flu in Bal'a village in the Tulkarm area of the
West Bank, northeast of Tel Aviv, have been confirmed, and some 250
000 chickens culled according to officials [see comment].

Bal'a is a major egg and poultry-producing area and part of its
produce is smuggled into Israel due to higher prices there, according
to Israeli Agriculture Ministry officials.

"We are always on the lookout for poultry and eggs smuggled into
Israel from the Palestinian Authority [PA] but now we are tightening
supervision at the PA-Israel crossings," the spokesperson's unit at
the Israeli Health Ministry told IRIN.

Israeli veterinary services assisted the PA by transferring the drugs
needed for the culling, said Shalom Simchon, Israel's minister of
agriculture, and he called on international organizations to
compensate Palestinian farmers for their huge losses.

PA forces surrounded Bal'a to prevent smuggling of poultry during the culling.

Cases of avian flu were also confirmed in Kibbutz Ein Gedi in Israel,
on the Dead Sea shore, on 7 May [2010] in a zoo; all birds were
culled and the Israeli Agriculture Ministry is closely monitoring the area.

Under international law, Israel is obliged to cease exports of
poultry and poultry products for one month following the discovery of
avian flu.

Animal avian flu cases have been discovered 3 times in Israel since
2006. In all cases birds were culled and no human casualties reported.

[According to unofficial sources, the culling in Bal'a has,
eventually, not (yet) been carried out. Confirmation or otherwise is
anticipated, as well as an official notification of the event to the OIE.

Bal'a is situated around 7 km [4.4 mi] east of Tulkarm; see map at
