This 9th outbreak has been eradicated by the slaughter of the 100 remaining birds.

HPAI H5N1 has been circulating in Viet Nam, causing several major events, since 2003. During this period 127 human cases of avian influenza have been reported, including 64 deaths (2 of them in 2014). The disease peaked in the 2 years 2004/2005 (90 cases, 39 deaths). Since then, control and prevention efforts of the animal health authorities were intensified, including vaccinations of poultry.

At present, another HPAI strain is circulating as well in Viet Nam, namely H5N6. - Mod.AS
