2002/145 Phytosanitary incident: potato spindle tuber pospiviroid found and
eradicated in France
A total of 4 African potato cultivars (_Solanum tuberosum_ cv. Mabondo 2,
Mabondo, 21, Kirundo and Sangema) were imported from Belgium and studied at
a breeding research station in Bretagne (France) for the production of
mini-tubers. The cultivars were tested for the presence of viroids and
phytoplasmas. In mid-January 2001, cv. Mabondo 2 was found infected by
potato spindle tuber pospiviroid (PSTVd - EPPO A2 quarantine pest).
Eradication measures were taken, the potato lot concerned was destroyed, and
any other lots which may have been in contact with it were tested and found
free from the viroid.
The same 4 African potato cultivars were also grown out at another breeding
station in northern France. Of 88 _in vitro_ potato clones at the breeding
station, 9 were found to be infected in tests done during March and April
2001. In all, 5000 samples of potato material originating from the breeding
station (first 2 generations of multiplication), either grown under
glasshouse or in the field, as well as second collection were subsequently
tested. PSTVd was found in 14 glasshouses, located in Nord Pas de Calais,
Haute Normandie, Picardie, Champagne-Ardenne, and Ile de France. PSTVd was
also found on 17 clones grown on 14 farms (corresponding to 14 fields)
located in the same regions as above (except Ile de France).
Phytosanitary actions were immediately taken. All infected material
(including potatoes grown in the vicinity of infected fields) was destroyed,
and movement of all pre-basic and basic potato material produced in the
north region was prohibited, awaiting tests.
>From October 2001 to February 2002, 68 500 tests were done on all pre-basic
and basic seed potato lots. No PSTVd-infected pre-basic material was found,
but 7 lots of basic material were found to be infected and were eradicated.
The origin of this infection could not be traced.
The NPPO of France considers that PSTVd has been eradicated. However, a
surveillance programme including 20 000 tests is being set up to confirm the
absence of PSTVd in the 2002 potato harvest.
The situation of potato spindle tuber pospiviroid in France can be described
as follows: Absent, found in a few imported potato lots, eradicated.

[Viroids are sub-viral pathogens that consist of small, circular,
single-stranded RNAs that have undergone extensive internal base pairing to
produce in vitro rod-like conformations of about 50 nm in length. They have
been classified into 2 families: Pospiviroidae (5 genera, one of which is
Pospiviroid) and Avsunviroidae (2 genera).
PSTVd is a very infectious and insidious pathogen that can depress yield by
40 to 60 percent. Major hosts are potato and tomato. Moreover, PSTVd is
efficiently transmitted by tubers, pollen, and in true seed up to 100
percent, making it very difficult to control. Chewing insects may also be
vectors of the viroid. PCR tests can facilitate rapid detection of the
pathogen. Note that there is no mention of how the authors detected the
viroid. Perhaps our colleagues in France can provide details. - Mod.DH]
