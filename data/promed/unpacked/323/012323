About 20 leprosy patients have been treated at a rehabilitated and expanded wing of the Battambang Provincial Referral Hospital, the 2nd hospital to offer professional treatment for leprosy patients in Cambodia.

"We have 2 doctors and one nurse who specialize in leprosy treatment, and in the 4 months since we opened, we have received about 20 patients," said Khak Seila, the hospital's director.

Harald Schmid de Gruneck, head of mission of the [International Committee of the Order of Malta, a non-profit organization based in Geneva that funds leprosy centers] (CIOMAL), said that the formerly small leprosy clinic is now fully functioning with modern equipment to perform reconstructive surgery and administer medication.

"Until this year [2013], Kien Khleang [Rehabilitation Clinic outside Phnom Penh] was the only reference center for treating leprosy patients, and there are many cases from Banteay Meanchey, Battambang, and Siem Reap [provinces], and to not have them all travel all the way to Phnom Penh, we decided to have one there again," in Battambang, Mr de Gruneck said, adding that there was no official date for the opening of the clinic, but that patients were already being treated.

Since the early 2000s, the number of leprosy cases in Cambodia started to decrease, but infections have increased again in recent years.

"In 2002, there were some 714 cases [of leprosy] and then it went down, down, down...and in 2010 we had 252 new cases. We asked if [fewer cases meant] the situation is actually improving or was it due to a lack of resources [to detect] cases," Mr de Gruneck said.

The number of cases had increased to 475 by last year [2012], according to CIOMAL.

Slow-developing bacteria [_Mycobacterium leprae_, the cause of leprosy] transmitted through droplets from the nose or mouth cause leprosy. Patients can carry the bacteria for more than a decade without showing any symptoms, Mr de Gruneck said. Without treatment, leprosy causes nerve damage and severe disabilities. "If you don't get proper treatment, you can transmit it... you can be positive but don't show symptoms and transmit it," Mr de Gruneck said.

[Approximately 17 000 Cambodians are said to have been treated with multidrug therapy (MDT) and cured of leprosy in the last 15 years [1] and Cambodia achieved the goal of "elimination" of leprosy as a public health problem in 1998, with a prevalence of less than 1 case per 10 000 people. The number of new cases detected (incidence rate per 100 000) was 747 (6.2) in 2000 [2], 740 (5.8) in 2002 [3], 509 (3.9) in 2003 [4], 461 (3.5) in 2004 [1], 429 (3.1) in 2005 [5], and continued to fall each year until 262 cases (1.8) in 2010 [4]. The article above implies that this fall in numbers of new cases reported annually from 2003 to 2010 may have been due to inadequate case finding as a result of insufficient resources.

The number of new cases (incidence rate per 100 000) then rose in 2011 to 475 (3.2) in 2012 [6]. The almost 500 registered new cases of leprosy in Cambodia in 2012 is still less than a third of the number of new cases reported annually 2 decades ago [7].
