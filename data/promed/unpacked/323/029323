Potentially deadly algae have been found in Hemlington Lake [Middlesbrough, England]. Members of the public are being warned to avoid contact with the water and keep pets away from the water's edge.

Growth of the blue-green algae, which occurs naturally in inland waters, estuaries, and the sea, has been encouraged by the warm water temperatures and stable sunny conditions. Its presence in Hemlington Lake has been confirmed by the Environment Agency and warning notices have now been put in place.

Research has shown that around half of all blooms of the algae produce toxins which can be harmful to humans and some animals if consumed in significant quantities. These toxins can kill wild animals, farm livestock and domestic pets, while in humans they can cause rashes after skin contact and if swallowed can cause vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, and muscle and joint pain.

There have, however, been no recorded long-term problems or deaths in humans.

Members of the public are advised to:
- heed warning signs;
- keep away from the water's edge and avoid contact with any scum on the water;
- keep pets away from the water's edge;
- if taking part in water activities, avoid swallowing the water, wear protective clothing and shower afterwards.

A spokesperson for Middlesbrough Council said: "Warning notices have been placed at all entrances to Hemlington Lake. They give brief advice and contact details for the recreation centre, Middlesbrough Council and the Environment Agency."

Blue-green algae are usually suspended in the water or attached to rocks or other material. Blooms can look like paint or jelly or form small clumps and may be blue-green, grey-green, greenish-brown, or reddish-brown in colour.

The algae are likely to subside when the weather cools. A similar warning went out for Hemlington Lake in May last year [2015].

[The article does not tell us what type of remedial action the area is taking. It is likely that, as warning signs have been posted, they will simply let the toxic algae run its course and die off naturally. There are a number of cyanobacteria or blue-green algae that can cause quite serious problems. While this article calls it toxic green algae, it is most likely one of the cyanobacteria or blue-green algae.

Dog owners should be advised to leave the dogs at home, as the blue-green algae can kill canines, horses, cattle, and possibly others. Readers are advised to see the moderator's comments in ProMED-mail posting 20160202.3988561. - Mod.TG
