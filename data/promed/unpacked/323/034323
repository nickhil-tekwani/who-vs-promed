FW: Armenia - suspected FMD - request for information
-----------------------------------------------------
In relation to the recent posting on Armenia, please find below
further information.

Since 2004, the EuFMD Commission, based in FAO, with the financial
support of the EC, has provided supplies of FMD vaccines to the Trans
Caucasus countries (TCC: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia) for
re-enforcement of the vaccination programmes operated by the National
Veterinary Services in the populations at high risk, predominantly in
the border regions with Turkey and Iran. No FMD outbreaks have been
reported by Armenia since 2001.

In neighbouring Iran and Turkey, and possibly other neighbours,
several recent epidemic waves have occurred which threatened the
TransCaucasus countries: type A Iran 05 in 2008-9, and a rapidly
spreading regional epidemic of FMDV type O PanAsia-2 of the ANT-10
lineage, since March 2010. The latter, with a peak in mid 2010, is
probably accounting for most of the almost 7000 outbreaks recorded
(not all confirmed or typed). Of high concern is also the current
circulation of FMDV Asia 1 in Iran (the 1st of this serotype since
2004) and countries to the east.

In the Trans Caucasus countries, priority is paid to the vaccination
of high risk cattle populations, to vaccinations in relevant species
near international borders, and to vaccinations of animals migrating
to seasonal pastures. In the autumn 2010 campaign in Armenia, the FMD
vaccination coverage was 77 percent for cattle and 6 percent for small
ruminants. The spring 2011 vaccination campaign has been completed in
May for high risk cattle populations. The majority of the vaccine was
bivalent (O PanAsia2, A Iran 05), while 13 percent of the vaccine was
trivalent, containing Asia 1 antigen as well. The decision to use
Bivalent vaccine was taken on basis of the risk assessments in late
2010, at which time Asia-1 had not been seen in the region for more
than 6 years. A trivalent reserve is maintained in case of need for
re-vaccination around confirmed outbreaks, and may be called into use
if the current suspected outbreak is confirmed.

The support for the Trans Caucasus countries also includes diagnostic
and epidemiological assistance, including for regular
sero-surveillance. The support to these countries forms part of the
West Eurasia FMD Control Roadmap 2020, involving the 14 countries most
at risk -- or which are regularly affected by the regional epidemics
in this viral ecosystem (FMD virus pool 3) [see comment].

Summary reports for the TCC are provided online, every 6 months in
the Report of each EuFMD Session.

[Dr Sumption's authoritative and exhaustive response to ProMED-mail's
RFI is gratefully acknowledged.

The mentioned Regional FMD Roadmaps address 7 FMD virus pools: Pool 1
- South-East Asia; Pool 2 - South Asia; Pool 3 - West Eurasia; Pools
4,5,6 - Sub-Saharan Africa; Pool 7 - South America. At present, the
most active programs involve pools 1, 3 and 7.

Identifying suspected outbreaks during their early stages, proper
application of the prescribed sampling methods in susceptible species
(with particular attention to small ruminants, dominant species in
semi-arid areas) and appropriate transportation of collacted samples,
are prerequisites for any success of FMD control programs.

Hopefully, samples have been collected in Armenia and submitted to a
reference laboratory. - Mod.AS]
