Anthrax Probe Leads to U.S. Source [edited
----------------------------------------------
WASHINGTON -- The anthrax that killed 5 people appears to have been
produced in the United States, the White House said Monday, but
investigators still don't know who mailed it. White House press
secretary Ari Fleischer said the evidence on the anthrax sent to Sens.
Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., is increasingly
"looking like it was a domestic source."
Technicians, meanwhile, ran into more problems trying to sanitize a
Senate office building contaminated by lingering anthrax spores from
the letter sent to Daschle in mid-October. Attempts to pump poisonous
gas into the Hart Senate Office Building's ventilation system to kill
any remaining spores failed early Monday, said Capitol Police
spokesman Lt. Dan Nichols. He said a mechanical problem kept the gas
from reaching the saturation point [500 parts per million needed to
kill the spores.

Official: CIA uses anthrax, but no link to letters [edited
----------------------------------------------------------
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The CIA uses anthrax in its bio-warfare program,
but the bacteria did not make it into tainted letters sent to 2 US
senators and several news organizations, an agency official said
Sunday. The confirmation that the CIA has anthrax comes less than a
week after the US Army admitted it has produced small amounts of the
potentially deadly bacteria for years. But, just as Army officials
denied any connection to the anthrax letters, a CIA official said the
anthrax detected in letters sent earlier this fall "absolutely did
not" come from CIA labs. [They say they have records of all incoming
& outgoing anthrax. - Mod.JW
The Washington Post reported Sunday that the FBI is focusing its
anthrax investigation on a contractor who worked with the CIA. The
newspaper said the contractor may be the source of the "Ames strain"
of anthrax found in letters sent to Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle, Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, NBC News' anchor Tom Brokaw and
several other news organizations. But the CIA official, while
confirming the agency has small amounts of the Ames strain for testing
purposes, told CNN "we did not grow, create or produce" the anthrax in
the letters, and "we are not the source of this material." (David
Ensor, CNN Washington Bureau)
[Another much-quoted piece in Sunday's Washington post covers much of
the same ground:

I just read the most recent ProMED-mail posting about the origin of
the deliberately released anthrax spores. In this letter there were
references to 2 articles in sunspot.net. In the article from 13 Dec
2001 it says:
" ... Some of the anthrax produced by Dugway has matched the fine
particle size and extraordinary concentration of the powder mailed to
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, estimated at close to 1 trillion
spores per gram, according to a government scientist.
In addition, the mailed anthrax is genetically indistinguishable from
the Ames strain used by the Army, the most sophisticated test methods
show. ..."
What information exists on the formulation of the fine anthrax spore
particles? Does the Army (Dugway proving ground and/or USAMRIID or
other US Army unit using this type of anthrax spores) weapons-grade
anthrax contain the same additives (silica?) as the deliberately
released anthrax? Nothing of that nature has been commented on so far.

[There is a good account of Paul Keim and his genomic work on the
following Los Angeles Times site:

We seem to have reached that place in the investigation where those
who know (the FBI) are wisely not talking, and those who don't are,
with finger pointing in every direction by journalists egged on by
their respective editors. The physical-chemical-biological
characteristics of the Daschle & Leahy powders must be thoroughly
known by now, thereby providing an excellent source signature for the
investigators. Until such time that there is a breakthrough, I propose
that this thread be paused. That will either provide a period of
decent quiet or perversely a reactive revelation. Either way we are
ahead. - Mod.MHJ
