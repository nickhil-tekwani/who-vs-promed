[In the posting "Foot & mouth disease (type A) - Jordan: OIE" of 16
Jan 2007, we included the following queries:
Has the outbreak in Amman, which reportedly started on 15 Oct 2006
and confirmed 19 Dec 2006, remained solitary?
Has there been any spread?"

No response has been obtained so far. The following data, which have
become available from the WRL for FMD website [Pirbright, UK --
source URL above] on 24 Jan 2007, indicate infection of 3 animals. It
would help to note whether they have been sampled in one or more
locations. - Mod.AS]

[The 3rd Roundtable meeting on FMD control in the Middle-East and
North Africa was held in Damascus, Syria, 6-7 Nov 2006. It was hosted
by the GF-TADS Regional Steering Committee for the Middle-East.
Countries and international organizations which participated in the
meeting included Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman,
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Turkey, United Arab Emirates,
Yemen, FAO (Rome), OIE (Central Bureau and Regional), WRL (Pirbright,
UK), USDA APHIS IS Cairo Area Office, the Russian FGI-ARRIAH and
French Ministry of Agriculture. The vaccine production private sector
was represented.

The following excerpts are derived from the on-line available summary
of the meeting's report. - Mod.AS]:

"In 2005-6, the Middle East has been very hard hit by rapid invasion
and impact of 2 distinct serotype A viruses, one which emerged in
Iran (A Iran 05) in 2005-6, and an incursion of an African type A
virus into Egypt causing widespread outbreaks in January-July 2006.
In Turkey and Iran, the type A vaccines in routine use did not
prevent the new strain from spreading. The A Iran 05 strain continues
to circulate in Turkey and I.R. of Iran, and has been detected in
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia in 2006." [No FMD notifications from the
latter 3 countries are available on OIE's website for the years
2005-2006. - Mod.AS]

"The dynamic situation requires continuous monitoring, not least
because 1st detection of new strains in the centre of countries
rather than at the borders, and because of rapid animal trade
movements, and also because other antigenic variants of serotype A
were observed in 2005 and may continue to persist in the region and
give rise to later reemergence."

[The report which has recently become available on the EUFMD website
does not include the 21 appendixes with the detailed country reports
and additional information on vaccination/vaccines. However, the
above cited excerpts are sufficient to indicate that the new FMDV A
lineage, which has been spreading throughout Iran since 2005, moving
during 2006 westwards into Saudi Arabia and Turkey (including
Thrace), and probably not (sufficiently) responding to available
vaccines, should be regarded as an imminent animal health threat
within the entire Middle East region and beyond.

Early complementary information on the recent Jordanian FMDV-A
epidemiology, including details on the lineage of the involved virus
strain, are of importance.

Enhanced transparency of individual countries and timely
dissemination of information acquired by international organizations
to all parties within and outside the region are of paramount weight
in the effort to control the disease. - Mod.AS]
