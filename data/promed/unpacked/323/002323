A woman who had been in the capital of Zulia state acquired an infection that could be due to Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) [virus], as was reported by the La Guajira department Health Office [in neighboring Colombia].

The person is 58 years old and resides in Rioacha [Colombia]. This situation was reported by the Office of Public Health Surveillance of the Secretariat of Health.

The unit responsible for health control and oversight of the Guajiros [indigenous people] received samples from the examinations, sent them on to the country's capital [Bogota], and are awaiting the arrival of the results.

The woman traveled to Maracaibo, Zulia state (Venezuela) on Thu 21 Feb 2013, and on Mon 25 Feb 2013, she developed mild brain symptoms. She self-medicated (she does not recall the medicine), arrived in the Rioacha municipality, was admitted to the Cedes Clinic, and later was admitted to the General Clinic North of Barranquilla.

There has been follow up [in Colombia], and the officials are in constant communication with Elsa Bravo, Director of the Office of Public Health Surveillance of Barranquilla city.

It is known that the patient is in stable condition, and the sample was sent to the [Colombian] National Institute of Health [IPS] in the city of Bogota for the relevant studies.

Jorge Juan Orozco Sanchez, Secretary of Health of La Guajira, stated that they await the notification from IPS in Rioacha and delivery of the clinical history of the patient. "We are awaiting the laboratory results that will come from Bogota and pending field investigations, since it has not been possible to contact a close relative of the woman in order to obtain the epidemiological data related to this case," the official stated.

[The patient in this case apparently acquired her infection in Zulia state, Venezuela but became seriously ill on return home to neighboring Rioacha, La Guajira department, Colombia.

The northern coastal plain of Colombia and adjacent Venezuela have historically been areas of significant VEE epizootics, with high mortality in unvaccinated equine animals and significant morbidity among humans. Both epidemic/epizootic Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus (subtype IAB), with equine mortality and human morbidity, and endemic VEE virus (subtype ID), which can cause sporadic cases in humans, occur in this area. Interestingly, there is no mention of equine cases occurring in the area that would suggest that epidemic/epizootic subtype VEE virus is responsible for this human case, if confirmed.

It is curious that there is no mention of follow up epidemiological investigations being carried out in Zulia state, Venezuela, where the infection was presumably acquired. ProMED would appreciate receiving additional information about results of the laboratory tests confirming (or not) VEE virus infection and any further epidemiological field studies either in Colombia or in Venezuela.
