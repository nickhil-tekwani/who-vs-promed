[On 29 Dec 2010, ProMED-mail published information from a reliable
source on suspected FMD cases in cattle in Iraq. This was followed,
several weeks later, by a submission from a senior veterinary adviser
to the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), Erbil-Iraq, encouraging
Iraq and other countries of the region to submit samples and to "have
a good reporting and recording system, be fully transparent, and use
all facilities available to us." In a commentary, ProMED-mail joined
the expectation for "samples from Iraq, either already available or to
be derived soon from adequate animals, to be submitted to the WRLFMD
for identification, serotyping and genotyping. This is particularly
important to exclude exotic strains."

It is indeed encouraging to note that 17 samples have been submitted
in April from Iraq to the WRLFMD.

According to WRLFMD data, the FMDV-O strain which has been recently
identified in Bulgaria (ANT-10 sub-lineage of the PanAsia-2 lineage),
has been spreading in the region, including Afghanistan, Iran,
Pakistan and Turkey. A recent single outbreak in Israel was also
caused by the same strain
(http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2011/WRLFMD-2011-00016%20O%20Israel%202011.pdf).

Since Iraq borders both Iran and Turkey, it may be assumed that
regional virus strains may be circulating within its borders. Their
serotyping and genotyping results are anticipated with interest. -
