The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food of the Balearic Government has confirmed a positive case of bluetongue on the island of Mallorca. Following the protocols of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPA), the Department will collect samples from various farms. The results of these samples are expected on Tue 29 Jun 2021 and will confirm the existence or not of an outbreak.

The samples that tested positive are from a specimen of beef cattle, from a livestock farm in Pollen√ßa. The samples have been analyzed by the Central Veterinary Laboratory (LCV) of Algete (Madrid), which belongs to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.

The General Directorate of Agriculture, Livestock and Rural Development, of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, is working on the protocols in anticipation of the declaration of a possible outbreak. As a preventive measure, it has suspended the guides for transporting animals to live farms. Slaughter transport guides are allowed.

Bluetongue is a non-contagious infectious viral disease that affects domestic and wild ruminants, caused by an arbovirus that is transmitted only through the bite of infected _Culicoides_ mosquitoes. Bluetongue does not pose any risk to consumers, not even the meat and milk from infected animals.

[ProMED thanks Dr Mahmoud Orabi for the submission of earlier media reports addressing the event.

Mallorca is one of the 4 main Balearic Islands, an archipelago of islands in Spain in the western Mediterranean Sea, near the eastern coast of the Iberian Peninsula. The number of sheep on the island was, in 2018, 95 000 (a 17% decrease compared to 2008).

Bluetongue (BT) results from infection by bluetongue virus (BTV), a member of the genus _Orbivirus_ and family Reoviridae. At least 26 serotypes have been identified worldwide. Isolates differ in virulence; some strains seem to cause few clinical signs. BTV can reassort and recombine to produce new variants. This virus is endemic in a broad, worldwide band of tropical and subtropical regions, including the Balearic islands. However, outbreaks also occur outside this area, and the virus may persist long-term if the climate and vectors are suitable. While overwintering in regions with cold winters is unusual, BTV recently demonstrated the ability to survive from year to year in central and northern Europe.

BTV can replicate in many species of ruminants. Clinical cases tend to occur mainly in sheep; in cattle, it is mostly subclinical. Outbreaks occur during the vector's activity season, mainly the summer and autumn months.

The white Mallorcan sheep, similarly to other Mediterranean island breeds such as the Corsican, Sardinian, and Sicilian sheep, is very susceptible to BTV; early detection and serotyping will allow preventive measures, in particular vaccination of sheep with matching vaccines.

Results of the laboratory investigations are anticipated soon. - Mod.AS]
