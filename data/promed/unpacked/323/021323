Kenyan medics worried about spread of typhoid
-----------------------------------------------
An outbreak of typhoid fever has killed at least 5 people and infected more
than 150 others in western Kenya since March 2005, the region's top
physician said on Mon 11 Apr 2005.
In addition to the deaths, at least 160 people have been admitted to
hospitals with typhoid symptoms in Bungoma district, in Kenya's Western
Province, since early March 2005, provincial health officer Olango Onudi
told reporters. "We have established that the cause of the outbreak was
using untreated water," he said.
Kenyan newspapers put the typhoid death toll as high as 21, but Onudi said
that figure was inflated, as most of them had perished from unrelated
diseases in the province, which is prone to water-borne diseases. "We are
trying to put the situation under control," he said. "The government has
started to distribute chlorine tablets to every homestead in the most
affected division."
