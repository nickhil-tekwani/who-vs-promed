Risk assessment for the reoccurrence of bluetongue disease in Germany
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The last outbreak of bluetongue disease (BT) virus serotype 8 (BTV-8) in Germany was officially confirmed on 17 Nov 2009. During the years 2010 and 2011, serological and virological monitoring in both domestic and wild ruminants provided no evidence for virus circulation. On this basis and in accordance with Article 6 (2), Commission Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007, Germany has been declared as free from BT with effect of 15 Feb 2012. The same date applies to the declaration of revocation of the BTV-8 restriction zone. Hence, according to Directive 2000/75/EC, vaccination against BTV is forbidden. This risk analysis addresses the following questions:

1. What is the risk for Bluetongue disease (all serotypes) re-occurrence in Germany?
2. Is the risk of re-occurrence of BTV-8 higher than that of other BTV serotypes?

Question 1:
----------
a. The release risk for the re-occurrence of BTV comprises of the
-wind spread of live vectors infected with BTV serotypes occurring in Europe,
-introduction of infected vectors by trade or traffic,
-trade with susceptible animals,
-trade with sperm,
-use of live vaccine and
-persistence in the domestic and wildlife populations.

The release risk is estimated as low.

b. In the exposure assessment, the risk is estimated as negligible during winter months, moderate for the summer months with regard to the spread by live vectors, and as low for all remaining potential routes of entry.

c. Risk of re-occurrence of BTV in Germany/ Risk assessment

release assessment/ Low
exposure assessment/ Low - medium
consequence assessment/ High

In the Consequence assessment, the risk of reoccurrence of BT is estimated as high, as the proportion of the population that is protected against BTV-8 will decrease to nearly zero in the coming years. There is no protection against other serotypes. Even with a mandatory vaccination against BT, continuous immunization against all serotypes would be required to prevent the spread of the disease upon entry into Germany. Voluntary vaccination cannot efficiently prevent the spread of BT in the case of virus introduction.

Question 2:
-----------
The risk of a de novo introduction of BTV-8 is not assessed as higher than the risk of introduction of other serotypes of BTV.

[A later epizootic, which has infected large and small ruminants during the summer and autumn months of 2011 throughout Germany, caused by a new, emerging vector-borne virus -- the Schmallenberg virus [SBV] -- may be indicative of a higher risk for the reoccurrence of Bluetongue disease in Germany than predicted by the above risk assessment. SBV, still under study, is likely to be transmitted in Europe by the same vectors (_Culicoides_ spp) as BTV. The initial time of SBV introduction to Europe is yet to be determined; its source and route of introduction are as enigmatic as those of BTV-8.

BTV-8 in Europe has been discussed in a comprehensive "policy Review" issued in 2011 by Biosecurity Australia. The Review's useful chapters 'distribution' and 'origin' are presented, for subscribers' convenience, in the following item 2. - Mod.AS]

BTV serotype 8: Distribution (page 20)
---------------------------------------
BTV8 first appeared in August 2006 in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and Luxembourg, and spread to northern France. Between July 2006 and December 2008, BTV8 accounted for about half the 244 000 cases of BTV in Europe due to serotypes 1 and 8 and infected over 60 000 holdings between 2006 and July 2009. Most BTV8 cases (70%) were reported in cattle. The spread of BTV8
decreased after 2008, with 350 cases reported in 2009 and 19 cases in 2010.

- In 2007, BTV8 reached the Czech Republic, Denmark, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
- In 2008, BTV8 extended to the Mediterranean coast and southern France, southern Spain, Sweden, Hungary and Austria.
- In early 2009, subclinical BTV8 was detected in cattle in Italy near the French border and in Sardinia, and in sheep in Greece on the island of Lesvos.
- In France and Spain, the distribution of BTV8 overlaps with BTV1. In late 2008, BTV8 was detected in Andalusia in southern Spain.
France reported more cases of BTV8 and BTV1 in 2008 than 2007, despite vaccination.
- BTV8 was considered endemic in Belgium and the Netherlands in 2007 and in France, Germany and Switzerland in 2008.
- Sweden detected BTV8 in Sep 2008 in a limited number of holdings after surveillance testing of bulk milk. Norway notified the OIE of BTV8 infection in cattle in Feb 2009 but spread was limited.

BTV serotype 8: Origins (pp 20 - 23)
------------------------------------
In the past, BTV8 has been recorded in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, South and Central America, and India. Serological evidence of BTV8 infection in sentinel cattle in Bulgaria in 2006 raised concerns that BTV8 was associated with the use of modified live virus vaccine (MLV) against several serotypes during an outbreak of BTV9 over 1999 to 2000. However, initial genetic analysis of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) showed conclusively that BTV8 in Europe was most closely related to a 1982 isolate of BTV8 from Nigeria. Complete genome analysis confirmed that the European strain of BTV8 was derived from 'western' topotypes of BTV present in sub-Saharan Africa and that it differed from the MLV strain.

However, full genome sequencing also showed associations between BTV8 and South African vaccine strains of BTV serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 and isolates of BTV serotypes 2 and 4 from Corsica, which also originated in Africa. The strain of BTV8 in Europe also has features of a laboratory-adapted virus. BTV passaged repeatedly in mammalian cell lines may acquire undesirable characteristics, such as
the ability to cross the placenta and appear in semen. Reports that BTV8 is readily isolated in mammalian cells also suggest laboratory adaptation. Other reports claim that the European strain of BTV8 required passage in insect cell culture before it could be isolated in mammalian cells and embryonated chicken eggs. BTV field strains are generally more likely to grow and retain virulence in insect cell culture than in mammalian cell culture.

Previous work showed that biological characteristics of other BTV serotypes may alter after genetic reassortment between field isolates. For example, increased infectivity and length of viraemia in mammalian hosts were observed after reassortment of an Indonesian Java C strain with local isolates of BTV serotypes 20 and 21 in northern Australia.

Epidemiological analysis of the outbreak of BTV8 in Europe resulted in nomination of 1 May 2006 as the date from which measures to manage the risk of BTV8 were justified. This date assumed a conservative incubation period of 100 days before the 1st possible date of infection (17 July 2006) plus one month's delay before bluetongue was diagnosed and the Netherlands notified the OIE. There is no definitive explanation for the almost simultaneous appearance of BTV8 in Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands in 2006. This is
despite investigation of several possible routes: wind events; transport and livestock movement from eastern to western Europe; importation of cut flowers flown in daily from Africa and BTV8-infected vector larvae in horse manure at an international horse event. An analysis of the 1st recorded outbreaks, stored milk samples, and surveys of farmers concluded that BTV8 was introduced into southern Belgium near a national park on the German border when vectors became active in the spring of 2006.

Imported semen was used in some of the first 150 herds confirmed as bluetongue infected in Belgium. Introduction of BTV8 via germplasm was investigated by tracing registered imports of semen and embryos between 1 Jan and 18 Aug 2006. However, countries of origin were not infected with BTV8 at the time of semen collection (Germany, Italy, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom) or any period (United States and Canada). The study did not trace semen imported at an earlier date which was stored or semen transferred to the region from other areas. Other routes of BTV transmission (transplacental or oral) were not investigated.

The re-emergence and rapid spread of BTV8 in northern Europe after winter in 2007 were unexpected. Several factors are thought to affect the spread of BTV in Europe:

- Changes in distribution of BTV in Europe are attributed to climate driven factors, such as the extended distribution of vectors, increased vector capacity to transmit BTV and infection of novel vector species.

- Non-climatic factors have also contributed to BTV spread, including the inherent susceptibility of vectors to remote strains of virus and overlap in distributions of vector species. Effects of human activities in providing micro-environments for vector survival and breeding, such as animal housing, feedlots and silage, are unknown.

- Long distance spread of vectors on the wind. The spread of BTV8 to the United Kingdom in Sep 2007 and to Sweden in Aug 2008 was most likely via infected Culicoides spp. borne on the wind from northern Europe.

Mass livestock movement also introduced BTV8 into uninfected countries after virus 1st appeared in north-west Europe:

- Cattle imported from the Netherlands, France, and Germany into Northern Ireland, England, Scotland, Italy, Spain, Portugal, the Czech Republic, and the Slovak Republic tested positive for BTV8 with RT-PCR tests. Portugal reported that 15% of imported consignments contained at least one animal that was RT-PCR positive to BTV8. It is not known whether animals were also positive on virus isolation (and therefore infectious) but RT-PCR positive animals were usually destroyed to avoid local spread.

- Within herd spread was reported after Hungary's first case of BTV in September 2008 from imported PCR-positive cattle from France.
- In 2007, feedlots in northern Italy introduced BTV8 via imports of 57 500 cattle from infected zones in France. Post-movement testing from October 2007 to January 2008 showed that 0.6% of imported cattle were seropositive, and of these, 80% were PCR positive. Surveillance between March and May 2008 showed limited seroconversion in the herds receiving imported animals but no spread to
neighbouring herds. Ongoing surveillance showed that between May and August 2008 BTV8 had not spread beyond five local herds in Verona province, despite the presence of competent vector species for BTV8 in northern Italy in 2007.

- In late 2008, surveillance detected BTV8 in Italy in clinically normal cattle, sheep, and goats in Sardinia and cattle in Piemonte, near the French border.
