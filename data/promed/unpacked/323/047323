The Israeli Ministry of Health has reported almost 40 cases of salmonella infection linked to tahini products that have also sickened 5 people in the USA. The Ministry of Health found a possible connection between the salmonella accumulation and tahini by Achdut with expiry dates 7 Apr 2019 through 21 May 2019.

The agency again highlighted an earlier recall and advice, which told people not to consume tahini with those expiry dates of all weights and package variants that had been marketed to retail, institutional markets and restaurants.

The Ministry of Health said it was continuing an investigation into the 38 infections in Israel and was in communication with authorities overseas where cases related to these products were also being investigated. On 22 Nov 2018, Achdut informed customers that salmonella was found in a lab test conducted for raw tahini in North America.

Tahini products packed under 5 brands were recalled in the USA last month [November 2018] because a sample tested positive for a strain of _Salmonella_ Concord that had infected people in the country. States with cases are HI, MI and NY.

The FDA advised consumers not to eat Achva, Achdut, Soom, S&F, Pepperwood, and Baron's brand tahini. The expiration dates it gave, ranging from 7 Apr 2020 to 21 May 2020, differed by one year from those given by the Israeli authority.

Of the 5 U.S. patients interviewed, all reported consuming hummus made with tahini; 3 people said they ate tahini or hummus made with tahini in a restaurant in the USA, while the other 2 reported consuming tahini or hummus made with tahini during international travel.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has also identified illnesses associated with tahini products during its investigation into a foodborne outbreak. The agency did not say how many people were sick, but the investigation has led to several products being recalled.

[Tahini is a paste made from raw sesame seeds. Other products made from sesame seeds include hummus and halvah. Previous outbreaks of salmonellosis have been associated with food products produced from sesame seeds. As reported in a previous ProMED posting (Salmonella typhimurium DT104 - Australia, Europe 20010822.1980), between 1985 and 2001, the National Enteric Pathogen Surveillance Scheme (NEPSS) in Australia has recorded the isolation of 17 different _Salmonella_ spp. from sesame seeds and sesame seed products, including hummus, tahini, and halvah, on 30 occasions. Sesame seed products should be always be considered when attempting to identify a source of salmonellosis. - Mod.LL
