3 unexplained deaths in the Federal District
---------------------------------------------------
Regional health authorities are investigating the unexplained deaths of 3
young people last weekend in the locality Planaltina, satellite city of the
capital, Brasilia. The 3 victims, who were unrelated to each other, died a
few hours after reporting to the hospital with symptoms of fever, headache,
and weakness.
Arnaldo Bernardino, health secretary of the Federal District, reported that
of special concern is the fact that there is no familial or residential
relationship between the victims. 2 of them lived in the locality of Sao
Sebastiao and one in Planaltina.
The 3 patients, ages 16, 18, and 21, arrived at the regional hospital of
Planaltina in the early hours of last Sunday [23 May]. The autopsies
revealed 2 common findings: pleural effusion (hemorrhage of the membrane
surrounding the lungs) and pulmonary edema (abnormal collection of fluid in
the lungs).
The epidemiological surveillance team is investigating whether the deaths
were caused by a hantavirus infection or by leptospirosis. In 2003, at
least 16 cases of hantavirus infection with 8 deaths were confirmed in
Minas Gerais. The disease is transmitted by rats and causes pleural
effusion. In 2002, 14 cases and 7 deaths were reported.
The National Health Foundation reported 4128 cases of leptospirosis in the
country in 2000 but provided no data as to the number of deaths.
Symptoms appear between 2 and 30 days after the infection and frequently
include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
The laboratory results should be available in 15 days. A team of 30 people
is conducting interviews among the relatives and friends of the victims, as
well as trying to identify the places where they might have been. Initial
studies rule out hemorrhagic dengue fever and hepatitis. Bernardino, who
believes these deaths could also be an "unhappy coincidence", commented
that authorities are urging all persons presenting fever, weakness, and
headache to consult the closest health center.
The hospital's press office has not been authorized to provide information
on these cases but reported that one of the victims consulted the hospital
last Thursday; the patient received symptomatic treatment and was
subsequently released. On Saturday he returned to the hospital and died
soon thereafter.

[More information on this apparent cluster of undiagnosed deaths would be
appreciated. The news article suggests they have ruled out dengue
hemorrhagic fever and hepatitis, and are awaiting laboratory results for
hantavirus pulmonary infection and leptospirosis. One of our moderators
has suggested that it is possible these 3 young adults may have been at a
"rave" (all night underground dance parties popular with teens and college
students for their loud techno music and drug use) and used designer
drugs. Methamphetamine and its derivatives can produce high fever and
pulmonary edema. The fact that the 3 individuals arrived at the same
hospital on the same day and perhaps in the same part of the day (early
Sunday AM) does suggest there may be a commonality to their exposures, even
if a direct liaison between them has not been established as yet. - Mod.MPP]
