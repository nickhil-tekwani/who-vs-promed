An estimated 30 per cent of the 17 000 ha of garlic grown in 2017 in the province of Mendoza are affected by white rot. The fungus may also affect onion crops.

The provincial garlic and onion growers association blames the outbreak on lack of money to carry out appropriate preventative measures, like field sanitation and crop rotation. They say that the fungus will remain in the soil and poses a threat to next season's crops. They also state that farm saved garlic seed and seed bulbs are used widely, spreading the fungus.

A garlic development fund is being set up from export levies which will be used for research on the fungus and development of management strategies.

[White rot caused by _Stromatinia cepivora_ (previously _Sclerotium cepivorum_) is considered the most severe disease of garlic and onions, but also affects other species in the genus _Allium_ (such as leeks, chives, shallots, ornamentals and weeds). Symptoms may include stunting of plants; leaf yellowing and dieback; as well as stem and bulb rot. Sclerotia (hard, protective survival structures) are formed on affected roots and can survive in the soil for many years without host plants.

The fungus is soil borne and spread by infected plant material (including seeds and seed bulbs), contaminated equipment, mechanical means and water. Disease management may include cultural and phytosanitary measures, including removal of crop residues and long crop rotations. Symptomless volunteer crop plants or weeds may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Fungicides are often of limited use for soil borne pathogens, but some chemicals or allium extracts are available that, when applied to contaminated soil, will "trick" sclerotia into germinating in the absence of a host which leads to the eventual death of the unprotected fungus. Use of certified clean planting material is essential. No white rot resistant garlic or onion cultivars are currently available.

Similar diseases on other crops called white moulds or rots may be caused by species previously classified under the genus _Sclerotium_ (for example, stem rot of rice, white mould of peanut), but many of these have now been moved to other genera.
