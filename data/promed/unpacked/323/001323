Indonesia woman dies of bird flu, toll up to 87
-----------------------------------------------
JAKARTA: A 44 year old Indonesian woman has died of bird flu, taking the
country's total death total from the disease to 87, a health ministry
official said on Monday. The woman, from Pekan Baru city on Sumatra island,
fell sick after she bought chicken in a market last month, Azizman Saad,
head of bird flu management at the hospital where she was treated, told
Reuters. "She was treated for high fever at several hospitals before
finally beingadmitted to Arifin Achmad Hospital on October 4. She died the
next day," Saad said.
Genetic sequencing tests by Indonesia's main laboratory for bird flu
research showed that the woman had contracted the deadly H5N1 virus, health
ministry official Joko Suyono said by phone. Indonesia has had 108
confirmed bird flu cases, of which 87 have been fatal, the highest for any
country in the world. The most common way to contract the bird flu virus is
through sick fowl. Although bird flu remains an animal disease, experts
fear the virus could mutate and spread from human to human, turning into a
pandemic that could kill millions.
