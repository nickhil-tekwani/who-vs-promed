The Jizzakh Oblast [Uzbekistan] court [sentenced on 21 Oct 2013] 20 defendants to various prison terms for distributing a tainted livestock vaccine that killed thousands of sheep last year [2012], 12.uz [see comment] reported [22] Oct 2013, citing a source in the oblast court.

The defendants' prison terms ranged from 3 to 13 years.

One defendant brought 228 000 doses of tainted and falsely labelled vaccine from Kazakhstan to Uzbekistan, the court determined. Farmers in 3 Uzbek oblasts and in Suzak District, Kyrgyzstan, injected their sheep with the vaccine, which was contaminated with pseudorabies virus.

Veterinarians saved about 75 per cent of the 45 000 injected Uzbek sheep, 12.uz reported. In Kyrgyzstan, about 2000 sheep died, Lenta.ru [see comment] reported. The Uzbek who sold the tainted vaccine to Kyrgyz farmers escaped arrest.

[According to the Uzbeki media source "12.uz" cited above, the 228 000 doses of vaccine, allegedly introduced illegally from Kazakhstan, were labeled "Sheep pox vaccine, freeze dried" as well as "VNIIViV manufacturer of the GNU (Government scientific establishment. All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Veterinary Medicine and Microbiology)". The source further cited the representative of the regional court: "As a result of vaccinations many animals were killed, and the amount the damage has is astronomical. Each of the defendants in the case -- and they exceeded 2 dozen -- were found guilty under several articles of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan and received from 3 to 13 years in prison". See at http://www.12uz.com/#ru/news/show/opshestvo/15396/ (21 Oct 2013, in Russian). The other media source cited above can be found at http://lenta.ru/news/2013/10/21/sheeps/ (21 Oct 2013, in Russian).

Contamination of live animal vaccines with pathogenic viruses is a well known, serious hazard requiring the full attention of those (in-plant and external/official) bodies responsible to assure the safety of biologicals. Each master seed must be tested to ensure its identity and shown to be free from adventitious viruses, in particular pestiviruses, such as border disease (BD) and bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) virus. The production or different viral vaccines within the same plant may be related to such contamination, particularly when there are gaps in the prescribed biosecurity in the plant.

Contamination of live sheep vaccines, such as sheep-pox, with pestivirus, in particular BD, was recorded in the past in several occasions and in various countries. We are not aware at present of a previous contamination of such vaccines with the Aujeszky virus. The opposite scenario, namely contamination of live attenuated Aujeszky vaccine with an ovine pestivirus, has been recorded (Ref).

Aujeszky's disease (AD) is caused by an alphaherpesvirus that infects the central nervous system and other organs, such as the respiratory tract, in a variety of mammals except humans and the tailless apes. It is associated primarily with pigs, the natural host. The disease in sheep is not common. In sheep (and cattle) it is almost always fatal within a few days. The 1st symptom is intense pruritus concentrated in a patch of skin ("mad itch").

It will be interesting to note if the institute which produced the batches of the contaminated sheep pox vaccine was also engaged in the production of Aujeszky (pseudorabies) virus vaccines, and if these contaminated batches could have been used also in other countries, in particular Kazakhstan. The importation of the vaccine from Kazakhstan is not necessarily indicative of its origin/manufacture in this country.
