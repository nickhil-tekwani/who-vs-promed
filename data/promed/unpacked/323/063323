India on Tue 20 Jul 2021 reported its first bird flu death as an 11-year-old boy, who was undergoing treatment at AIIMS for it and succumbed to the disease.

A senior All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) official said that the boy, who was infected with avian influenza, has died, and the entire staff concerned has been placed in isolation as a preventive measure.

As per reports, bird flu outbreaks were reported across the country earlier this year [2021], including in Haryana where the H5N8 subtype -- which is not known to infect humans -- was detected.

After the bird flu outbreaks, the Central government sounded an alert as cases were confirmed in Delhi also.

A sample collected from the Red Fort had tested positive for bird flu in January [2021]. The Delhi government had then ordered the closure of the Ghazipur poultry market.

More samples collected from the Delhi zoo had returned positive in February [2021]. According to the World Health Organisation, human cases of bird flu occur "occasionally" but when they do happen, the mortality rate is about 60%.

[According to the above report, the 1st fatal case due to an avian influenza virus has been reported from India. The virus subtype involved in this incidence cannot be ascertained from the information provided in the article, though subtype H5N8 has been reported in bird outbreaks in 2021 in Delhi.

Human infections with the A(H5N8) virus cannot be excluded, although the likelihood is low, based on the limited information obtained to date (https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/assessment-of-risk-associated-with-influenza-a(h5n8)-virus). In February 2021, Russian authorities reported 7 poultry farm workers aged 29 to 60 years infected with the A(H5N8) strain of avian influenza virus, although they showed no symptoms. "Based on available information, the risk of human-to-human transmission remains low, and WHO recommendations have not changed as a result of the incident." (https://www.euro.who.int/en/countries/poland/news/news/2021/3/avian-influenza-ah5n8-infects-humans-in-russian-federation).

Further information on the confirmation of the avian influenza subtype in this case would be highly appreciated. More details on the above report can be accessed at the following links:
