Again, the outbreak is associated with imported animals. I will repeat
general comments I made when the UK experienced in 2005 -- see below.
It was reported and subsequently eradicated in the United States in
1978. There was a small flurry of cases in 1998 associated with imported
animals.
Contagious equine metritis is a venereally transmitted disease which can
cause infertility. It is associated with bacteria including
_Taylorella equigenitalis_ and spreads through direct transmission from
mare to stallion or teaser and vice-versa.
The disease is sporadically reported in Europe, Japan and Morocco. There
were 14 cases in the UK in 1996 and 2 in 1997. The UK was disease-free
between 1998 and 2002.
It was reported and subsequently eradicated in the United States in
1978. There was a small flurry of cases in 1998 associated with imported
animals. - Mod.PC]
