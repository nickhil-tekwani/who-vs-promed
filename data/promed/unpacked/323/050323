Situation summary in the Americas
---------------------------------
- In 2015, 3 countries in the Americas confirmed circulation of yellow fever virus: Bolivia reported epizootic [monkeys] and Brazil and Peru reported human cases.

- In 2016, as of epidemiological week (EW) 44, 3 countries had reported jungle yellow fever: Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.

Since the publication of the Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) yellow fever epidemiological update of 14 Sep 2016 up to EW 44 of 2016, Brazil has not reported additional cases of yellow fever. Previously they had reported 2 autochthonous and 1 imported from Angola; the autochthonous cases were reported in Bady Bassit in São Paulo state and in the state of Goiás.

In Colombia, between EW 1 and EW 43 of 2016, a total of 12 jungle yellow fever cases have been reported (6 laboratory-confirmed and 6 probable). The confirmed cases were reported by the departments of Antioquia, Amazonas, Meta, Vaupés, and Vichada; the latter 3 of which account for 75 per cent of the total cases reported. The place of origin of infection of the case detected in Amazonas is the municipality of Caballococha, Peru.

The confirmed yellow fever case in the department of Vaupés is the 1st documented yellow fever case in that department. All of the confirmed cases are male and 66.6 per cent are between the ages of 20 to 29 years. A total of 5 out of the 6 confirmed cases died (case fatality rate [CFR]: 83.3 per cent).

The distribution of confirmed and probable cases by department is shown in table 1 and in figure 1 [see URL for table and figure. - CopyEd.AO]. Given the confirmation of cases in the Vichada Department (bordering the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) as well as in the Choco Department (bordering Panama) there is a risk of the circulation of the virus in both of the bordering countries, especially in areas with the same ecosystem.

In Peru, up to EW 42 of 2016, there were 75 cases of jungle yellow fever reported. Of the reported, 62 were confirmed and 13 were categorized as probable. Out of the 25 departments in Peru, cases have been reported in 9 departments, with the department of Junin reporting most of confirmed and probable cases (50 cases).

The number of confirmed and probable cases reported in Peru between EW 1 and EW 42 of 2016 (75), exceeds the number of cases (confirmed and probable) reported in the previous nine years (figure 2) [see URL for figure. - CopyEd.AO].

Situation in other regions
--------------------------
As indicated in the PAHO/WHO yellow fever epidemiological update of 26 Jul 2016, the countries outside of the Region of the Americas who reported yellow fever outbreaks in 2016 are: Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Uganda.

In Angola, the last confirmed case of yellow fever had symptom onset on 23 Jun 2016. Since then, no new cases have been confirmed. As of 20 Oct [2016], 2 new suspected cases were reported. The vaccination campaign of at risk populations remains in effect (phase II).

In the Democratic Republic of Congo the last confirmed urban yellow fever case had onset of symptoms on 12 Jul 2016. Since then until 26 Oct 2016, a new case of jungle yellow fever was confirmed and 14 probable cases remain under investigation.

In Uganda, they declared the end of their yellow fever outbreak on 6 Sep [2016]; this outbreak was not related to the outbreak in Angola.

In addition, as a result of the exposure of unvaccinated persons to the yellow fever virus in Angola, cases of yellow fever were exported to China (11 cases) and Kenya (2 cases).

The situation generated by unvaccinated travelers to areas where there are active outbreaks of yellow fever poses a potential risk of introduction of the virus to areas where the risk factors of yellow fever (human susceptibility, prevalence of the competent vector and animal reservoirs) are present.

Recommendations
---------------
The recommendations indicated in the PAHO/WHO yellow fever epidemiological update of 26 Jul 2016 remain in effect.

[The presence of cases of YF in the Amazon Basin countries mentioned is not surprising, and cases occur there in both humans and monkeys. The virus is endemic there, maintained in the sylvatic (forest) cycle of transmission. Finding of YF cases in the Choco department is of concern due to its proximity to the Darien region of Panama, where conditions are suitable for virus transmission, with the potential to spread northward where _Aedes aegypti_ are found with the potential to spark an urban outbreak in the largely unvaccinated human population.
