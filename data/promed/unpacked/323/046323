A 52-year-old woman from barangay Parian, Cebu City was infected with rabies after being bitten by her pet cat on Wed 2 Jan 2013. The case is the 1st of its kind in the city under her watch, said Dr. Alice Utlang, chief of the Department of Veterinary Medicines and Fisheries (DVMF). The cat's head will be sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) for confirmatory testing. She also urged all cat and dog owners in the city to have their pets registered with her office for a P 150 [USD 3.70] fee so they will be given rabies shots. "This should serve as a warning to Cebuanos that rabies is not only common among dogs. Even cats could be rabid," she said. The cat may have been bitten by an infected dog, she said.

The female victim told DVMF staff that she found the stray cat on the street and brought it home out of pity. The stray cat bit her while she fed it [on 2 Jan 2013]. The cat died the next day. An examination on 4 Jan 2013 showed the cat had [symptoms of] rabies. "I ordered an investigation because this is the 1st time for Cebu City to have a cat rabies case," said Utlang in a press briefing at the mayor's office.

About 12 [canine?] rabies cases were reported in Cebu City last year [2012] from the following barangays [suburbs]: Apas (1), Basak Pardo (1), Bulacao (2), Guadalupe (1), Hipodoromo (1), Mabolo (1), Pasil (1), Punta Princesa (1), Sambag (2), Sudlon II (1). The city veterinarian is intensifying the campaign to have dogs registered.

A vaccination drive is scheduled after Sinulog Barangay workers are deputized to help in their registration campaign. Utlang said their target is to register and vaccinate at least 80 percent of the total dog population in the city. The annual drive is done in January as part of the city's anti-rabies ordinance and the Anti-Rabies Act. Utlang said those who fail to register their dogs will be issued citation tickets. Violations of the 2 ordinances may be settled by the immediate payment of the P 150 [USD 3.70] registration fee and registration and vaccination of the pet dog.

An option is to do community service by bringing 5 dog owners and their pets to DVMF for registration and vaccination within 3 days from the issuance of a citation ticket, Utlang said. In barangay Punta Princesa, DVMF-deputized personnel issued 24 citation tickets to violators of the Anti-Rabies Act and ordinance during a January [2013] operation. They all opted for settlement of their violation. Of the 24 violators in barangay Mabolo, 5 opted for settlement, while 19 were charged in court.

[Previously, it was reported that as late as 2011, the Philippines was estimated to be among the top 10 rabies hotspots in Asia. More recently, there have been successful efforts in some parts of the country to improve the situation by enhanced dog rabies control programmes and increasing awareness of the general population. The current report draws attention to the fact that cats can contract rabies (probably mainly from dogs) and transmit the infection to humans.

Education of the population to the risk of rabies virus infection has become a priority in Cebu City at least. It is likely that the human victim in the present incident will survive as a consequence of prompt diagnosis and immediate post-exposure prophylaxis.

The City of Cebu is the capital city of Cebu and is the "Second City" in the Philippines, with the 2nd most significant metropolitan centre, and is known as the oldest Spanish settlement in the country. The city is located on the eastern shore of Cebu province. Cebu is the Philippines's main domestic shipping port and is home to about 80 percent of the country's domestic shipping companies. Cebu is a significant centre of commerce, trade and industry in the region of Visayas.
