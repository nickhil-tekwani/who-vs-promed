--------------------------------------------------------------
I can understand the editorial comments about contamination at the time of usage, however Australia has very firm policies on the use of multi-dose vials. We just don't use them, except in rare instances where there is no choice, such as BCG [bacillus Calmette-Guerin] vaccine.

While I cannot release the findings of molecular studies yet, we have identical types across a number of health care facilities. The investigation is continuing, but it is implausible that this outbreak is a result of contamination by end users.

We have so far identified 7 cases with _Ralstonia mannitolilytica_, 2 with _Ralstonia pickettii_, and 1 with _Ralstonia insidiosa_, from sterile sites (blood, joint fluid) across 3 states, with a further possible case in another state. Not all strains within each species are identical, but some are.

This is an intriguing investigation, and one feature that may bring it together is that _Ralstonia_ species can pass through 0.2 micron filters used to sterilise solutions, as you pointed out in your commentary on the previous posting on this topic.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Koehler again for the additional information. There are now at least 10 cases of ralstonia infection (blood, joint fluid) linked to receipt of propofol at different healthcare facilities in 3 different states in Australia. Most of the patients were infected with _Ralstonia mannitolilytica_ (7 cases), but 2 cases were infected with _Ralstonia pickettii_, and 1 case with _Ralstonia insidiosa_. Some patients at different healthcare facilities had identical molecular types identified, which would suggest intrinsic contamination of propofol (that is, during manufacture, packaging or storage) prior to end use. This is indeed an intriguing outbreak. We await further updates.

_R. insidiosa_ can be differentiated from other species of the genus _Ralstonia_ and phenotypically similar species by a variety of biochemical tests, whole-cell protein analysis and several PCR-based assays (http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/content/53/4/1075.full.pdf). - Mod.ML
