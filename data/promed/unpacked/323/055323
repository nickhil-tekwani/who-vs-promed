One more person in Surat died of the mystery fever on Friday [11 Oct 2013], taking the toll to 6. The victim of the mysterious fever died at Sufi hospital at Lalgate. He has been identified as a 24-year-old resident of Kadarshah ni Naal in Nanpura.

Suspecting it to be a rodent-borne disease, the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) has installed 73 rat traps in different parts of this area. It has sent 9 samples of blood, spleen, and liver of rats to the National Institute of Communicable Disease [NICD] in Delhi for laboratory tests.

This is a wake-up call for the city that was hit by the plague in the early 1990s, followed by a spell of leptospirosis after the 2006 catastrophic flood. The SMC officials have begun detailed investigations at Kadarshah ni Naal, which was under water for 3 days following torrential rains. Several patients from these areas complained of vomiting blood and fever. Many people in other areas in the city, like Chhaprabhatha, Singhanpore, Ved Road, and Kosad, are suffering from leptospirosis.

In charge health commissioner SMC, Dr Hemant Desai, said, "We have witnessed that there are many patients suffering from this mysterious fever. While some of them have been [diagnosed as cases of] leptospirosis, we have sent samples of rats to NICD in Delhi for detailed investigations. We will get the report on Monday [21 Oct 2013]. We are also carrying out the cleaning drive and making people more aware about the fever."

[This new account adds one further death attributed to an undiagnosed hemorrhagic fever, and the additional information that elsewhere in Surat City cases of leptospirosis have been confirmed. This information added credence to the suggestion by Jan Clement and Marc Van Ranst (in item [2] of ProMED-mail 'Undiagnosed deaths - India (02): (GJ) comments 20131014.2000971') that a rodent-borne hantavirus may be responsible for these fatalities. Hopefully this possibility will be considered in the current investigations of the outbreak at the Indian Institute of Virology in Pune and the National Institute of Communicable Disease in Delhi. - Mod.CP
