I would like to emphasize our moderator's response to this inquiry about
getting advice for prophylaxis of rabies and plague after contact with wild
animals. Every state and most counties in the USA (>3,500) have local
experts in public health for humans and non-humans alike (physicians,
epidemiologists, vector biologists, veterinarians, laboratorians, ...). If
you don't know the name of your local county medical health officer or
public health veterinarian, get out your phone book and give them a call
today. If you have no faith in your local experts, please contact your
state health department. The problems you raise are exactly what we are
trained to deal with and mandated to resolve by state and local regulations.
