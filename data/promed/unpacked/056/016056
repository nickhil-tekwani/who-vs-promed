The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 6 Mar 2019:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 913, of which 848 are confirmed and 65 are probable. In total, there were 574 deaths (509 confirmed and 65 probable) and 306 people healed.
* The probable new case of Masereka has been removed from the caseload pending validation by the Supervisory Committee.
- 181 suspected cases under investigation;
- 7 new confirmed cases, including 5 in Katwa, 1 in Butembo, and 1 Kyondo;
- 6 new deaths of confirmed cases: 3 community deaths, including 1 in Katwa, 1 in Kyondo, and 1 in Butembo; 3 deaths at ETCs, including 2 deaths in Butembo and 1 in Mabalako;
- 2 new recoveries released from Butembo ETC.

News of the response
Role of security in the areas affected by the Ebola outbreak
------------------------------------------------------------
- There appears to be a lack of understanding of the role of law enforcement in Ebola-affected areas. Police and the military are not involved in Ebola response activities and their role has never been to force compliance with sanitary measures.
- Given the numerous security incidents against the agents of the response but also against the families and members of the community who adhere to the response, the Ministry of Health asked the Ministry of the Interior to ensure the security of the goods and services and people in the area. It is unacceptable for health workers to be threatened and assaulted in the course of their work. Likewise, it is unacceptable that families are prevented from burying their relative in a dignified and secure manner because of groups of unseemly people.
- As local health workers do not have the privilege of being exfiltrated when security conditions deteriorate, there is a need to increase security to ensure a successful response. In addition, since the arrival of the response teams in North Kivu in August 2018, the improvement of the security situation in the region is a permanent demand of the population. The return of security is, moreover, one of the conditions issued by MSF to return to Butembo and Katwa.

Arrival of the Director General of WHO in Kinshasa
--------------------------------------------------
- The Director General of WHO, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, arrived this [Thu 7 Mar 2019] in Kinshasa. He is accompanied by Dr Matshidiso Moeti, Regional Director, WHO Office for Africa, Dr lbrahima Soce Fall, WHO Regional Director for Emergencies, Stewart Simonson, Assistant Director-General for the WHO. Administration, and Pierre Formenty, WHO expert on dangerous pathogens.
- The Minister of Health, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, received the delegation to his Cabinet and thanked the WHO for its field work alongside the Congolese teams. He particularly emphasized the contribution of WHO to the rapid rehabilitation of Ebola treatment centers in Butembo and Katwa. The reopening of the Butembo ETC, just days after the attack by gunmen, sends a strong message to those trying to disrupt the Ebola response, which is that the agents will remain in office until the end of the war.
- The Director General of WHO congratulated the Minister and the Government of the Republic for their strong leadership. Although the epidemic is not yet fully under control, the efforts made have made it possible to contain the epidemic geographically in 2 provinces of the country. This result is remarkable considering the mobility of the population and the security context. However, the risk of spread in other provinces and neighboring countries remains present as long as the epidemic remains active.
- During the exchanges, particular emphasis was placed on community engagement strategies. Community dialogue has shown that the public wants the Government and the partners not only to fight Ebola alone, but also to help them improve their general living conditions. The Ministry of Health initiated the design of a community development and recovery program to ensure economic and social recovery in the affected provinces after the end of the Ebola outbreak.

Vaccination
-----------
- Since vaccination began on 08 Aug 2018, 86 012 persons have been vaccinated [total numbers of people vaccinated in North Kivu, Ituri, Tshopo, and Haut-Uele provinces can be seen at the source URL above].

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 5 Mar 2019:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 907, of which 841 are confirmed and 66 are probable.
In total, there were 569 deaths (503 confirmed and 66 probable) and 304 people healed.
- 223 suspected cases under investigation;
- 6 new confirmed cases, 2 in Katwa, 2 in Mandima, 1 in Butembo, and 1 in Masereka;
- 1 new probable case being validated at Masereka.
- 3 new deaths of confirmed cases: 2 community deaths, including 1 in Masereka and 1 in Mandima; 1 confirmed case death at Butembo ETC.

News of the response
Probable case of Masereka
-------------------------
The probable new case is the wife of Masereka's confirmed new case. She died at home on 4 Mar 2019, a day after her husband. Because of the reluctance of the family, the collection and dignified and secure burial could not be made for the woman but they were made for her husband the day before. With the family being a member of the Evangelical Church of the African Rite (EERA), the coordination of the response contacted the church's Patriarch, and curator of customs to ask for his involvement. Touched by the story of this family, the Patriarch visited this community to raise awareness about Ebola and the importance of respecting the measures for dignified and safe burials. A good example of community involvement.

Vaccination
-------
Since the beginning of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 85 867 people have been vaccinated [total numbers of people vaccinated in North Kivu, Ituri, Tshopo, and Haut-Uele provinces can be seen at the source URL above].

- 3 new confirmed cases, 2 in Katwa and 1 Masereka: the new confirmed case of Masereka is a man residing in Butembo who went to his parents' home in Masereka for treatment;
- 2 new deaths of confirmed cases: 1 community death in Masereka and 1 confirmed case death at Mangina ETC.

News of the response
Press conference in Kinshasa
----------------------------
- The Minister of Health, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, held a press conference on Tue 5 Mar 2019 in Kinshasa. The press conference focused on 3 main points: the global evolution of the epidemic, the situation in Butembo and Katwa, and the 3rd strategic response plan.

Community dialogue in Butembo
-----------------------------
- Community dialogue continues between those responsible for the Butembo response and the communities in Butembo town and surrounding areas. After meeting with the neighborhood leaders of Butembo City, 100 grassroots leaders and community leaders in Vuhovi, the response coordinators met with about 100 delegates from the Bashu Chiefdom community. As with all the meetings initiated as part of this community dialogue, the objective was to discuss the reasons for the attacks on the response teams in order to make concrete proposals for the resumption of response activities in a favorable climate.
- Concerning the reasons for reluctance, some elements recur in most health zones. Often, at the beginning of the response, community leaders were informed and sensitized about Ebola and the work of the response teams, but these leaders did not always pass on this knowledge to their constituents. The fact that the response teams were accompanied by the police in less secure areas was perceived with suspicion. Some local health providers who were not directly involved in the response have intoxicated the community by spreading messages that are contrary to the messages of the response teams. Of course, the politicization of the epidemic because of the electoral context did not help.
- Among the proposals, the participants recommended, among other things, to further involve local health workers in all pillars of the response, to raise awareness, to increase funds to restore security in the region, to involve unemployed youth in the response to minimize rumors and reluctance.

Vaccination

Since the beginning of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 85 698 people have been vaccinated [total numbers of people vaccinated in North Kivu, Ituri, Tshopo, and Haut-Uele provinces can be seen at the source URL above].

[2] Outbreak summaries
- Wed 6 Mar 2019. Ebola total tops 900 in DRC, with 7 new cases today
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/03/ebola-total-tops-900-drc-7-new-cases-today
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

Today [6 Mar 2019] the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC) ministry of health confirmed there are now officially 907 cases of Ebola in an 8-month long outbreak in the country's North Kivu and Ituri provinces, reflecting 10 new cases in 2 days.

Regrouping after fires
----------------------
The cases come as officials continue to regroup and reorganize after 2 ETCs were burned in recent weeks in the outbreak's main hot spots, Katwa and Butembo.

Late yesterday [5 Mar 2019] DRC officials said community talks continue in Butembo to better bridge the gap between health workers and community members who have shown reluctance to the Ebola response.

"The fact that the response teams were accompanied by the police in less secure areas was perceived with suspicion," the DRC said in a summary of the meetings. "Some local health providers who were not directly involved in the response have intoxicated the community by spreading messages that are contrary to the messages of the response teams."

Also yesterday, Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, PhD, the DRC's minister of health, held a press conference in Kinshasa. While he said he expected the outbreak to be over in most health zones in the coming weeks, Butembo and Katwa remain a threat to the rest of the region.

Kalenga said the violent attacks on ETCs in those towns shows a "dangerously intense" local response to outbreak and health workers.
Though no one was seriously injured in Butembo's ETC fire, the attack caused Doctors Without Borders (MSF) to pull staff from the area.

Violence tied to breakdown of trust
-----------------------------------
In a commentary today [6 Mar 2019] in the New England Journal of Medicine, Vinh-Kim Nguyen, MD, a medical team leader for MSF working in Kayna, DRC, said an epidemic of suspicion exists among local populations and outbreak response workers.

Nguyen said some local community members see workers as "Ebola profiteers" -- interested only in stopping the spread of the virus and doing little to treat or correct other serious health problems, including malaria, cholera, and typhoid.

The recent attacks in Katwa and Butembo "resonate with prevailing anger driven by the perception that the Riposte's [international response's] massive funding is not being adequately redistributed and is largely benefiting outsiders," Nguyen writes.

"In this setting, crucial outreach activities, such as identifying cases and ensuring safe and dignified burials, can be dangerous. Tense and occasionally violent standoffs between frightened residents and response teams are a routine occurrence. So in areas deemed insecure, outreach workers and vaccination teams are being accompanied by armed military escorts."

Nguyen said outbreak responders have learned a great deal since West Africa's 2014-16 Ebola epidemic, including placing more emphasis on engaging the local communities. Still, he adds, mistrust remains, fueled in part by a growing global mistrust of scientists.

He concludes, "State-of-the-art medical interventions won't be enough without serious efforts to rebuild trust, informed by social science rather than pious liturgies."

Wellcome Trust increases funding
--------------------------------
Today [6 Mar 2019] the Wellcome Trust announced it would be giving 2 million pounds (USD 2.65 million) to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the government of the DRC to support vaccine research in the DRC.

Lingering symptoms in survivors
-------------------------------
Finally today [6 Mar 2019], the New England Journal of Medicine also published a longitudinal study on Ebola survivors in Liberia.
The study showed that during 12 months following recovery, 966 survivors reported 6 symptoms more than controls: urinary frequency (14.7% vs 3.4%), headache (47.6% vs 35.6%), fatigue (18.4% vs 6.3%), muscle pain (23.1% vs 10.1%), memory loss (29.2% vs 4.8%), and joint pain (47.5% vs 17.5%). All but the urinary pain improved within 12 months.

This was the 1st study to match Ebola survivors with controls who did not contract the virus but shared similar environmental exposures.

[The lack of trust has become a major issue in preventing termination of the Ebola outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri. There is a front page article in the New York Times on this problem (http://tinyurl.com/y6r9fpgf). Gaining trust is a facet of outbreak control that hadn't been taken into consideration on a significant level, and one that is now in the forefront of control efforts. It is not a topic students are generally taught in medical school. Anthropologists and social scientists are needed to educate the healthcare community on how to best address this component of disease outbreaks. The approach taken in the DRC to protecting the healthcare teams of having armed escorts apparently has traumatized the population further. But then, how does one protect workers at risk of violence? It seems winning over the population so they understand the risk and hazard of the disease was not convincingly conducted, and rather than seeing the healthcare workers as saviors, they are seen as threats. This may be the result of a population being traumatized and abused. But experts with fresh eyes are needed to evaluate how best to proceed in a safe and effective manner. - Mod.LK]

- Tue 5 Mar 2019. Democratic Republic of Congo: Ebola virus disease - external situation report 31
[UN OCHA, ReliefWeb, WHO report, abridged, edited]
https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/democratic-republic-congo-ebola-virus-disease-external-situation-46

The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo continues, as does the complex environment. Two Ebola treatment centres (ETCs) in Katwa and Butembo were successively attacked and burnt down during the week.

These attacks, indicating a shift in insecurity, were the first such large-scale and organized attacks directly targeting the Ebola response. Patients from the destroyed ETCs have been temporarily transferred to the Katwa transit centre, managed by the Ministry of Health. The Butembo ETC was quickly rehabilitated to receive patients again.

Since the last report on 26 Feb 2019, 25 new confirmed cases have been reported, with 15 additional deaths. As of 3 Mar 2019, a total of 897 EVD cases, including 832 confirmed and 65 probable cases, were reported from 19 health zones in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces. Overall, cases have been reported from 119 of 301 health areas across 19 health zones. A total of 563 deaths were reported (overall case fatality ratio 63%), including 498 deaths among confirmed cases. Of confirmed and probable cases with reported age and sex, 57% (510/896) were female, and 30% (271/896) were children aged less than 18 years. Three new cases among health workers were reported during the week, bringing the number of health workers infected with Ebola virus to 72, with 24 deaths.

A total of 30 health areas in 8 of the 19 health zones affected to date have active virus transmission, reporting at least one confirmed case in the last 21 days (11 Feb-3 Mar 2019). Over this period, a total of 73 confirmed cases were reported from Katwa (44), Butembo (19), Kyondo (1), Vuhovi (1), Kalunguta (2), 1 Beni (1), Mandima (4), and Rwampara (1). Trends in case incidence reflect that the outbreak is continuing, with most recent cases reported in the major urban centres of Katwa and Butembo, accounting for 86% (63/73) of cases reported in the last 3 weeks.

The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO and partners continue to monitor and investigate all alerts in affected areas, in other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in neighbouring countries. To date, all reported alerts outside the outbreak affected areas have been investigated or laboratory tested to rule out EVD.

[3] Response
- Tue 5 Mar 2019 'A slow-burn crisis': how Ebola will take months to resolve
[The Telegraph, abridged, edited]
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/slow-burn-crisis-ebola-will-take-months-resolve/
[Byline: Anne Gulland, Global Health Security Correspondent]

The Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo may not be brought under control until the end of this year, a senior UK government official has warned.

The official, who did not want to be named, said that although there were signs that the various control measures deployed by the authorities were working, there would be no quick resolution.

The official said: "This is a slow-burn crisis. It's going to take at least of the rest of this year to deal with it. It's not going to be controlled quickly."

The UK has been one of the 4 biggest donors to the current outbreak alongside the United States government, the European Union and the World Bank. Members of the UK-Public Health Rapid Support Team, a partnership between the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and Public Health England, have been on the ground since the onset.

Around 70 people have been given experimental Ebola treatments - the first time they have been used on such a large scale.

But the response is being compounded by mistrust from the community who resent the influx of both national and international responders when they feel they have been ignored for many years. There are also high levels of movement both inside and outside the country with experts fearing the spread of the disease beyond DRC's borders.

- Thu 7 Mar 2019: MSF -- DRC Ebola response failing to gain the upper hand on the epidemic
[MSF press release, abridged, edited]
https://www.msf.org/ebola-response-failing-gain-upper-hand-epidemic-democratic-republic-congo

- Despite a rapid and large outbreak response with new vaccines and treatments, the signs are that Ebola is not under control
- Since the beginning of the year [2019], more than 40 per cent of new Ebola cases are people who died of Ebola in the communities. At the epicentre of the epidemic, in Katwa and Butembo in North Kivu province, 43 per cent of patients in the last three weeks were still being infected without known links to other cases.
- Patients and communities must be treated as partners in the response; we must listen to their needs not preach to or coerce them

"We have a striking contradiction: on the one hand a rapid and large outbreak response with new medical tools such as vaccines and treatments that show promising outcomes when people come early -- and on the other hand, people with Ebola are dying in their communities, and do not trust the Ebola response enough to come forward," said International President of MSF, Dr Joanne Liu.

Last week [week of 25 Feb 2019], MSF suspended our Ebola activities in Katwa and Butembo, in North Kivu province, after successive attacks on the 2 treatment centres. While MSF does not know the motives or identities of the attackers, these incidents follow an escalation of tensions around the Ebola response. Dozens of security incidents occurred against the response as a whole in the month of February [2019] alone. While the causes of these acts are not all the same, it is clear that various political, social and economic grievances are increasingly crystallising around the response.

A range of issues have led to these tensions: from the massive deployment of financial resources focusing only on Ebola, in a neglected region suffering from conflict, violence and long-standing health needs; to elections being officially postponed due to the Ebola outbreak, exacerbating suspicions that Ebola is a political ploy.

The use of police and armed forces to compel people to comply with health measures against Ebola is leading to further alienation of the community and is counterproductive to controlling the epidemic. Using coercion for activities such as safe burials, tracking of contacts and admission into treatment centres discourages people from coming forward and pushes them into hiding.

The Ebola response must take a new turn. Choices must be given back to patients and their families on how to manage the disease. Vaccination for Ebola must reach more people, and more vaccines are needed for this. Other dire health needs of communities should be addressed. And coercion must not be used as a tactic to track and treat patients, enforce safe burials or decontaminate homes.

"Ebola is a brutal disease, bringing fear, and isolation to patients, families and health care providers," said Dr Joanne Liu. "The Ebola response needs to become patient and community centred. Patients must be treated as patients, and not as some kind of biothreat."

- Thu 7 Mar 2019. Doctors Without Borders fiercely criticizes Ebola outbreak control effort
[STAT News, abridged, edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2019/03/07/doctors-without-borders-criticizes-ebola-control-effort/
[Byline: Helen Branswell]

One problem, [Dr Joanne Liu, international president of Doctors Without Borders (MSF)] said, is the fact that the vaccine is being used in a ring vaccination approach, offered only to frontline workers and people who are known to have been in the virus's path -- known contacts of cases and contacts of the contacts.

Supplies of the vaccine, being developed by Merck, are limited, and it takes about a year to make new batches. So the World Health Organization, which is overseeing the vaccination program, is being cautious with its use. To date, nearly 86 000 people have been vaccinated in this outbreak.

Liu said people living in the outbreak zone do not understand why only certain people can be vaccinated. She argued using some of the other experimental vaccines -- there are several, though they are not as far along in the testing process as the Merck one -- would help.

She also advocated tailoring the response to the needs of the people, saying many don't want to be sent to treatment centers where health care workers are unrecognizable under layers of protective gear. "It means treating patients as humans, and not biothreats," Liu said.

There should be options for training people in the community in how to safely care for Ebola patients at home if they are adamantly opposed to going to a treatment center, she argued. Likewise, people living in communities that Ebola response teams cannot easily reach because of security concerns could be trained on how to safely care for their sick, she said.

- Thu 7 Mar 2019. Response to Ebola in Congo hampered by violence, says group
[The Telegraph, abridged, edited]
https://www.macon.com/news/article227231124.html
[Byline: Krista Larson]

Health workers battling Ebola in eastern Congo are facing "a climate of deepening community mistrust" nearly 7 months after the outbreak began, Doctors Without Borders warned [Thu 7 Mar 2019].

"The existing atmosphere can only be described as toxic," she said. "It shows how the response has failed to listen and act on the needs of those most affected."

As a result, people are still reluctant to bring the sick to treatment centers. More than 40 percent of the deaths are still taking place in communities rather than at Ebola treatment centers, according to the group, also known by its French acronym MSF.

The use of security forces in the area is also complicating efforts, she said.

"Using police to force people into complying with health measures Is not only unethical it's totally counterproductive," she said.

- Thu 7 Mar 2019. Negative feedback to Ebola outbreak response linked to political woes -- MSF president
[UrduPoint News/Sputnik, abridged, edited]
https://www.urdupoint.com/en/world/negative-feedback-to-ebola-outbreak-response-566322.html
[Byline: Faizan Hashmi]

The negative feedback on the response of authorities and humanitarian organizations to the ongoing Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is linked to its impact on the citizens' political freedoms, Joanne Liu, the international president of Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) non-governmental organization, said during a press conference on Thu.

The election in several DRC cities dealing with the Ebola outbreak, including Beni and Butembo, was postponed until March [2019]. In other places, the general elections were held in December [2018].

"Many of those with a negative view of the response feel that Ebola is being used as an excuse for political maneuvers. This suspicion was only exacerbated following the decision to exclude Beni and Butembo from the election at the end of 2018.

People told me, 'Ebola robbed me of my basic democratic right.' We must acknowledge that this outbreak is occurring in a deeply politicized environment," Liu said.

The MSF international president stressed that the community was not the problem.

"It is our collective responsibility to gain their trust and empower them to take ownership of the response," Liu said.
