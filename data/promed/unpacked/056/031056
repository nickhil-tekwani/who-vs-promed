The [Provincial] Ministry of Agriculture is warning of an increased risk of anthrax exposure in the RM of Piapot. Laboratory results confirmed 9 animals in the area have died from anthrax, according to the government.

The disease is caused by bacteria, which can live in spores in soil for decades. These spores can be found in pastures, sloughs and potholes. There is a higher risk of anthrax exposure in drier years, according to the ministry, when these areas dry up and are more accessible to animals.

Animals can become infected when they eat contaminated forage. Bison, cattle, sheep and goats are highly susceptible to the disease, the province said. Horses are also prone to infection. However, swine, birds and carnivores have some resistance to anthrax.

To avoid infection in farm dogs and cats, officials said, those animals should be kept away from any carcasses. The province encourages producers to vaccinate their animals annually and not to move any infected animal carcasses, as that could spread the spores.

Producers should call their veterinarian if they suspect their animal has been infected with anthrax. If anyone believes a person has been exposed, they should call their local physician.

[The Ministry note does not identify the species of livestock afflicted, but the CTV report carries a picture of a goat browsing, for whatever that may be worth. The rest is just advisory filler.

There was a severe epidemic in 2006 affecting the whole province with 153 ranches affected, involving 493 cattle, 254 farmed bison, 35 sheep and goats, 6 horses, and 3 pigs. There was a significant and effective vaccination response involving 400 000 cattle. As a result, there were only 6 outbreaks in 2007 with 14 cattle affected and 1403 vaccinated; in 2008, 3 outbreaks, 14 cattle affected, and 780 vaccinated; and in 2009, 2 outbreaks, 18 head affected, and 736 vaccinated. There were sporadic outbreaks in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, and 2015. The provincial veterinary service has an active programme to maintain awareness of this disease, to report unexpected deaths, and the real need for the ranch owners to vaccinate their stock each spring. And they are successful. In a dry summer, the moisture in a slough maintains green grazing and attracts animals. This can put animals at risk if in previous years an animal has died of anthrax in this slough, contaminating the soil, and the spores will lurk there and can, in certain circumstances, germinate and multiply in the root mass of this grazing -- which is why it is so important to vaccinate your livestock, especially cattle, each spring.

The Saskatchewan veterinary service has been striving hard to control this disease and with success. But then there are outbreaks like this to remind everyone to keep it up. As the value of an individual sheep is slight, ovine cases can be missed until the numbers increase. This is life.
