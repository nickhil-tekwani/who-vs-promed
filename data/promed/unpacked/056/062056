With a record 3609 cases of Lyme disease in 2011, this tickborne illness has become Wisconsin's 3rd most reported ailment, behind only chlamydia (24 254) and gonorrhea (4761). [The number of Lyme disease cases in 2011 (3609) is likely probable plus confirmed cases of Lyme disease (http://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/communicable/tickborne/Lyme/2010Data.htm). The CDC says that the number of confirmed Lyme disease cases reported in Wisconsin peaked at 2505 in the year 2010, then fell to 2408 in 2011, and fell again to 1368 in 2012 (http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/chartstables/reportedcases_statelocality.html).]

Diep "Zip" Hoang Johnson, an epidemiologist with the Wisconsin Department of Health Services [DHS], discussed the increase Wednesday [12 Mar 2014] at the annual winter meeting of the Wisconsin Chapter of the Wildlife Society. Johnson said Wisconsin recorded more than 18 000 Lyme disease cases between 2002 and 2011 -- more than triple the 5716 cases reported between 1990 and 2001. [The CDC says that there were almost 15 000 confirmed Lyme disease cases reported in Wisconsin between 2003 and 2011 -- from 740 in 2003 to 2408 in 2011 (http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/chartstables/reportedcases_statelocality.html).]

One reason is the tick responsible for Lyme disease has expanded its range. In surveys from 1981 through 2007, the black-legged tick [_Ixodes scapularis_] -- commonly called deer tick -- was most common in western Wisconsin.

The DHS' Division of Public Health and University of Wisconsin detected the tick's eastward expansion in 2008 while inspecting nearly 800 hunter-killed deer in eastern Wisconsin. They found the tick in 18 of the 21 counties they checked. Their research was published in the May 2013 issue of the Journal of Medical Entomology. "The results indicate that range expansion of (black-legged ticks) is continuing and the risk of tick exposure is increasing, especially in the eastern one-third of the state," the article reported. [Lee X, Hardy K, Johnson DH, Paskewitz SM: Hunter-Killed Deer Surveillance to Assess Changes in the Prevalence and Distribution of _Ixodes scapularis_ (Acari: Ixodidae) in Wisconsin. J Med Entomology 2013; 50(3): 632-9; abstract available at http://www.bioone.org/doi/ref/10.1603/ME12234.]

Johnson also warned that Lyme disease isn't Wisconsin's only tickborne disease. While the 1906 cases reported so far from 2012 represent 75 percent of the year's tick-related diseases, Wisconsin also had 586 cases of anaplasmosis/ehrlichiosis (2 similar diseases), which accounted for 23 percent of the cases.

Black-legged ticks spread all 3 diseases. These ticks are smaller than the common wood tick or dog tick, which doesn't cause human-health problems. [Incorrect. The American dog tick (_Dermacentor variabilis_) is the most commonly identified species responsible for transmitting _Rickettsia rickettsii_, which causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever in humans, and can also transmit _Francisella tularensis_, the cause of tularemia. The Rocky Mountain wood tick (_Dermacentor andersoni_) can also transmit Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia to humans. See http://www.cdc.gov/ticks/geographic_distribution.html.] An adult female black-legged tick, which is dark brown to reddish orange, is the largest of its species, yet measures less than 1/8-inch [3 mm], about the size of a large sesame seed.

However, most Lyme-disease victims get infected when bitten by black-legged ticks in spring and summer during their nymph stage, when they look like poppy seeds. June and July produce the year's most Lyme disease cases, typically accounting for 60 percent of them. When including cases from May and August, the 4-month period accounts for 80 percent of annual cases. [See http://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/communicable/tickborne/Lyme/2010Data.htm.]

Because black-legged tick nymphs are so small, many people never know they've been bitten. Further, about 20 percent of victims never develop Lyme disease's brand: a red bull's-eye skin rash. Only when experiencing fevers, fatigue, and headaches do they realize they might have Lyme disease.

To reduce risks when outdoors, Johnson recommends using permethrin or DEET of 20 percent concentrations on light-colored clothing. Also, wear long-sleeve shirts and tuck pants inside boots when venturing off beaten paths into brush, tall grasses, and other vegetation. Ticks don't jump or fly. They simply climb aboard as we push through vegetation they inhabit.

When returning indoors, thoroughly check for ticks. Next, take a shower and scrub vigorously to wash away unseen ticks. "A shower reduces your risk by about 95 percent," Johnson said. Don't panic if you find a blacklegged tick. Even if it's a nymph, 78 percent don't carry the Lyme bacteria. [An average of 22 percent of blacklegged tick (_I. scapularis_) nymphs in Wisconsin have been reported to be infected with _Borrelia burgdorferi_, the cause of Lyme disease (http://labs.russell.wisc.edu/wisconsin-ticks/lyme-disease/).] Further, they must stay attached at least 24 to 48 hours to transmit the bacteria.

Because Lyme disease is endemic in Wisconsin, the US Centers for Disease Control considers a tick-caused rash larger than 5 centimeters [2 in] a confirmed case of Lyme, even without a laboratory test. [The CDC defines erythema migrans, for purposes of surveillance, as "a skin lesion that typically begins as a red macule or papule and expands over a period of days to weeks to form a large round lesion, often with partial central clearing. A single primary lesion must reach greater than or equal to 5 cm [2 in] in size across its largest diameter." (http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/script/casedef.aspx?CondYrID=752&DatePub=1/1/2011).]

Lyme disease affects all age groups, but is most prevalent in children 5 to 14, and adults 55 to 74. It's least common in 25- to 29-year-olds and people 85 and older. Johnson thinks youngsters pick it up more often because they often roll in grass and play in brushy areas, while older people tend to spend more time outdoors gardening and landscaping. [See http://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/communicable/tickborne/Lyme/2010Data.htm.]

Antibiotics are effective if used early. Adults and children 8 and older are usually cured by taking 100 mg doses of doxycycline twice daily for 2 weeks. In fact, Lyme disease can usually be prevented if adults take one 200 mg dose of doxycycline within 72 hours of removing a tick.

However, if you have no symptoms or no evidence of a tick bite, it's a waste of money to insist on a laboratory test. "Screening tests do you no good," Johnson said. "They're a waste of time."

Once cured, there's no lasting immunity against Lyme disease. People can get infected more than once. [Reinfection has been well-documented only after successfully treated early infection (nearly always erythema migrans) and not after late manifestations of Lyme disease (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/45/8/1032.full).] Also, no vaccines for humans have been available since 2002. The 1st and only licensed vaccine against Lyme, LYMERix, was effective but expensive, and required a 3-dose series. When many patients didn't get the follow-up doses, and insurance companies didn't cover it, the manufacturer ceased production.

If you find a tick attached to your skin, remove it with a tweezers or tissue pinched between your fingers. Pull it straight out, not at an angle, and flush it down the toilet. Finally, cleanse the wound in alcohol and wash with soap and water.

[Lyme disease, caused by the spirochete _Borrelia burgdorferi_, is distributed focally within the United States: it is considered endemic in 8 northeastern states (Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island) and 2 upper Midwestern states (Wisconsin and Minnesota). These regions of the US correspond with the known geographic distribution of the Lyme disease vector _Ixodes scapularis_, the blacklegged or deer tick.

Climate change, growth of suburban neighborhoods into surrounding wooded areas, and enlarging populations of deer as well as of the white-footed mouse and other small rodents (the primary reservoirs for Lyme disease) are thought to be responsible for the spread of the disease (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5623a1.htm).

Both _Ehrlichia chaffeensis_, which infects blood monocytes, and _Ehrlichia ewingii_, which infects granulocytes, cause human ehrlichiosis in the US, although the majority of reported cases are due to _E. chaffeensis_. E. chaffeensis is most common in the south central and southeastern states, which correspond with the known geographic distribution of the lone star tick (_Amblyomma americanum_). The lone star tick transmits both _E. chaffeensis_ and _E. ewingii_. _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_, a bacterium closely related to the ehrlichiae, causes human granulocytic anaplasmosis. However unlike _E. chaffeensis_ and _E. ewingii_, _A. phagocytophilum_ (as well as _Borrelia burgdorferi_ and _Babesia microti_) are transmitted in the US by the ticks _I. scapularis_ and _Ixodes pacificus_.

Human ehrlichiosis was thought to be very rare or absent in Minnesota and Wisconsin, because the northern range for _A. americanum_ is not thought to extend into Wisconsin and Minnesota. In fact, in a 2009 study, of the 1518 blood specimens obtained from patients with suspected ehrlichiosis in Wisconsin and Minnesota residents, none were positive for _E. chaffeensis_ or _E. ewingii_, although 163 (10.7 percent) were positive for _A. phagocytophilum_ (35 from Wisconsin and 128 from Minnesota). In addition, infection by a new species of _Ehrlichia_ carried by the deer tick _I. scapularis_ was found in 4 patients (3 from Wisconsin, 1 from Minnesota) [Pritt BS, Sloan LM, Johnson DH, et al: Emergence of a New Pathogenic _Ehrlichia_ Species, Wisconsin and Minnesota, 2009. N Engl J Med 2011; 365(5): 422-9 doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1010493; available at http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1010493]. The unique nucleotide sequence of this new species was similar to that of _Ehrlichia muris_, a species not previously identified in North America. - Mod.ML
