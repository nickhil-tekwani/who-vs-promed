New outbreaks (1)
Outbreak 1 Matsue-shi, Shimane
Date of start of the outbreak: 5 Nov 2017
Outbreak status: Resolved (5 Nov 2017)
Epidemiological unit: Not applicable
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Mute Swan: _Cygnus olor_ (Anatidae) / - / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: On 5 Nov 2017, one _Cygnus olor_ (mute swan) was found dead in Matsue-shi, and the sample derived from it was tested positive for influenza A virus by antigen-capture kit. On 9 Nov 2017, the sample was confirmed positive for H5N6 subtype influenza A virus. Enhanced monitoring of wild birds is ongoing within a 10-km radius of the site. Interviews and on-sight inspection were carried out on poultry farms in the 10-km area, and no abnormality was found.

[The above event is the 2nd identified and officially reported wild bird found infected by HPAI H5N6 in Japan; the 1st one was reported to the OIE a year ago, November 2016. It was followed by an epizootic in poultry, which included 12 outbreaks spread throughout the country (a summary report with a map and links to all follow-up reports is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=21714). According to the said summary report, the event had resolved on 27 Mar 2017.

The final report (No. 15, submitted 28 Jun 017) included the following epidemiological comments:

"Japan declares to have regained its free status from avian influenza in poultry with effect from 28 Jun 2017 according to the Article 10.4.3 of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code. As specified in the Article 10.4.3, a stamping-out policy, including the destruction of all susceptible animals and the disinfection of the affected farms, was applied, and all the control measures were completed on 27 Mar 2017. Active surveillance with the confirmation tests to prove freedom from avian influenza were conducted by clinical inspection, serum antibody test, and virus isolation, and the 3-month period has passed since the application of a stamping-out policy without any new outbreaks (including disinfection of all affected establishments)."

HPAI H5N6, a zoonotic avian influenza strain, has been reported since May 2014 in wild birds and domestic poultry in several other countries in Southeast Asia, including Laos, China, South Korea, Viet Nam, Taiwan and Myanmar, causing financial losses and human disease. The total number of confirmed human infections with A(H5N6) viruses, as of 25 Sep 2017, is 16 (WHO figures).

Japan bans the import of live poultry and poultry products from countries and areas that are affected by HPAI, including China and South Korea. It has been suggested that migratory birds were important in the spread and genetic diversification of clade 2.3.4.4 H5 HPAIVs (see 20170918.5324107). Clade 2.3.4.4 viruses were detected in birds in 40 countries in Africa, Asia and Europe. The clade 2.3.4.4 viruses from Africa and Europe were primarily of the A(H5N8) subtype; those in Asia were primarily A(H5N6). - Mod.AS
