A BTV-4 event started on 29 Oct 2016 in the French island of Corsica, where 112 outbreaks have been reported so far, of which the most recent 12 outbreaks have been described in follow-up report No. 10, submitted to the OIE on 19 Oct 2017.

The current follow-up report No. 11 addresses the 1st BTV-4 new case in continental France. It is located on France's border with Switzerland (see map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=21777).
