Epidemiological Update: Cholera
-------------------------------
Haiti
-----
Since the notification of the 1st 2 confirmed cases of _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 in the greater Port-au-Prince area on 2 Oct 2022, to 1 Jan 2023, the Haitian Ministry of Health (Ministère de la Santé Publique et de la Population, MSPP per its French acronym), reported a total of 22 469 suspected cases (Figure 1 [for all figures, see original URL - Mod.LL]) in 10 departments of the country, including 1561 confirmed cases, 18 729 hospitalized suspected cases, and 452 registered deaths. This represents an increase in the last 7 days of 15% in suspected cases (n = 2877), 9% in confirmed cases (n = 134) and 25% in deaths (n = 89). As of 1 Jan 2023, 9 departments have confirmed cases (Artibonite, Centre, Grand-Anse, Nippes, Nord, Nord-Ouest, Ouest, Sud and Sud-Est). To date [4 Jan 2023], the case fatality rate among suspected cases is 2.0%.

Of a total of 4266 samples analyzed by the National Public Health Laboratory (LNSP for its acronym in French), 1561 were confirmed (36.6% positivity rate).

Of the total reported suspected cases with available information, 57% are male and 49% are aged 19 years or younger. The most affected age group is 1 to 4-year-olds (20%), followed by 20 to 29-year-olds (14.5%) and 5 to 9-year-olds (14%) (Figure 2). Among confirmed cases, 57% are male, and 47% are aged 19 years or younger. The most affected age group is 1 to 4-year-olds (19% of total), followed by 5 to 9-year-olds (15%) and 30 to 39-year-olds (14%) (Figure 3).

The Ouest Department continues to report the highest number of cases, with 70% of all suspected cases recorded. The communes of Port-au-Prince, Cité-Soleil and Carrefour account for 68% (n = 10 816) of all suspected cases reported in the Ouest Department (Figure 4). In the last 7 days, the department of Ouest reported an 11% increase in suspected cases and a 4% increase in confirmed cases. For the same period, the other departments reported an increase of 24% in suspected cases and 25% in confirmed cases.

The current conditions in Haiti must be considered when analyzing the epidemiological situation of this cholera outbreak using the available official data. Epidemiological surveillance is affected due to the complex humanitarian and security crisis, added to the limited access to fuel throughout the country, resulting in limited access to health services and laboratories. Moreover, most of the population in the country is in a highly vulnerable situation in the face of established cholera transmission chains in the departments and communes. The humanitarian crisis and insecurity have exacerbated in recent months. This has considerably undermined the efforts of the MSPP and other organizations to implement prevention and control measures, including epidemiological surveillance, leading to underreporting of cases.

The Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) is working in coordination with the Haitian public health authorities to characterize this event and support the response.

Dominican Republic
------------------
On 28 Dec 2022, the Dominican Republic Ministry of Public Health confirmed 2 additional cases of cholera in the country corresponding to 2 females of 33 and 44 years of age respectively, all of Dominican nationality, residents of the La Zurza sector of the National District, and with no travel history. To date, a total of 10 confirmed cases have been reported in the Dominican Republic, 2 of them imported from Haiti. The Ministry's press release is available at https://bit.ly/3vDX3KF.

Guidance for national authorities
---------------------------------
The Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) recommends that Member States continue their efforts to strengthen and maintain cholera surveillance in order to detect suspected cases early, provide adequate treatment and prevent its spread. Early and adequate treatment maintains the case-fatality rate (CFR) of hospitalized patients at less than 1%.

PAHO/WHO encourages Member States to simultaneously continue their efforts to guarantee adequate basic sanitation conditions and access to drinking water, in addition to hygiene promotion and social mobilization, to reduce the impact of cholera and other waterborne diseases.

Ministry of Health reports 3 new cholera cases
----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Public Health informed yesterday [6 Jan 2023] that 3 new cholera cases were detected, corresponding to 2 Haitian nationals, a 93-year-old female and a 4-year-old male, residents of the San Carlos sector, and a woman from La Zurza, in the National District.

A communication from the entity, released through the Vice-Ministry of Collective Health and its General Directorate of Epidemiology, indicates that the patients were admitted between 3-5 Jan 2023 after presenting with watery and whitish diarrhea accompanied by vomiting. When they were admitted to the health center, they were hydrated and stabilized, and coprological samples were immediately taken, with a positive result for cholera.

The Public Health epidemiological report certifies that the 4-year-old child recently returned to the country from Haiti, where he was vacationing with his mother.

According to the document, the patients have been without bowel movements for more than 24 hours, are stable, in good spirits, with a good appetite, and remain in the hospital for observation, with the possibility of discharge in the next few hours.

He added that the areas of Health, IV, and V, the Vice Ministry of Collective Health and its Epidemiological Directorate, and the Ministry's Risk Management Directorate are maintaining epidemiological surveillance with close relatives and a permanent intervention in the areas to detect, prevent and investigate any suspected cholera.

Public Health stated that so far, there are no relatives of patients with suspected disease symptoms and urged the population not to be alarmed and to be attentive to official reports.

These new cases of cholera appeared after the authorities managed to pass the Christmas and New Year's holidays without any suspected cases of the disease in the La Zurza sector or other nearby neighborhoods of the National District.

Sewage from sewage and toilets in La Zurza continues to be deposited in the Isabela River, despite an investment of billions of pesos in a treatment plant. A pumping sump was built in La Zurza to collect this water and send it through a pipe placed over a bridge parallel to the Jacinto Peynado to the treatment plant inaugurated on the other side of the river.

[In the wake of the devastation caused by the earthquake on 12 Jan 2010 that centered about 10 miles (about 16 km) south west of Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, cholera erupted prominently with more than 820 000 cases and almost 10 000 deaths. After several years, the number of cases has lessened but flares in times of stress, including hurricanes. The social and economic crises have continued and along with gang violence, a resurgence of the waterborne scourge has recurred. - Mod.LL
