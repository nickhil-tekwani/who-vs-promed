VERTICILLIUM WILT, OILSEED RAPE - UNITED KINGDOM (ENGLAND): FIRST REPORT

Agricultural research scientists working for the government's
Agricultural, Development and Advisory Service at Rosemaund in
Herefordshire have identified a disease of oilseed rape previously
unknown in the UK. And they believe the disease, verticillium wilt,
may have been responsible for falling yields of the rape in recent years.
"This is a disease we suspected but now we have confirmed its
presence in the country," scientist Jonathan Blake told the Hereford
Times this week. But Mr Blake was quick to point out that it is not
thought that this verticillium wilt has any link to another
verticillium wilt, the progressive strain of which has proved fatal
to hop plants in the county and Kent for many years. Research will
continue to establish what strain it is. "It is a coincidence that
they both have the same name," he said. "We believe there is no need
for farmers to worry if they consider planting oilseed rape on ground
which previously grew hops."
What effect this newly identified disease will have on the future
yields of oilseed rape will depend on further research by scientists
at Rosemaund. But Mr Blake did say that the disease may be weather
and season related.

[Verticillium wilt of oilseed rape (_Brassica napus_) is caused by
the soil-borne vascular fungus _Verticillium longisporum_. This
species attacks oilseed rape and other brassicas in many European
countries including France, Germany, Sweden, as well as in Japan. It
was recently recorded in California infecting cauliflower. The
growing area of intense rapeseed cultivation has rendered the
pathogen an increasing threat to oilseed rape production particularly
in Europe.
Unlike other _Verticillium_ diseases, _V. longisporum_ does not
induce wilting, but premature senescence and ripening which may
severely reduce yields by up to 50 percent. It can survive in dead
plant tissue and soil for extended periods. Disease management
includes deep ploughing to minimise inoculum and crop rotation with a
succession of non-susceptible species such as cereals or grass.
Fungicides are largely ineffective for a soil-borne pathogen.
Sufficient genetic resistance is not available in oilseed rape making
resistance breeding almost impossible. Resynthesized rapeseed
generated from interspecific hybridisation between resistant forms of
_Brassica rapa_ and _Brassica oleracea_ represents a potentially
important resource for developing resistant crop lines.
_V. longisporum_ was previously known as _V. dahliae_ var.
_longisporum_. It has now been established as a separate species,
although some controversy still remains regarding its classification.
Its host range is different from the one of _V. dahliae_. A clear
restriction of _V. dahliae_ to non-Brassica hosts (including
solanaceous crops such as tomato and eggplant) was observed while _V.
longisporum_ is pathogenic only on _Brassica_ species. Molecular
methods have revealed a hybrid nature of the species with components
of _V. albo-atrum_ and _V. dahliae_ both present in _V. longisporum_.
Thus _V. longisporum_ appears to be a host-adapted pathogen. This
explains why a threat to hop crops from the oilseed pathogen is
considered unlikely in the news report above.
_V. albo-atrum_ (and occasionally also _V. dahliae_) is associated
with verticillium wilt of hops. It also affects lucerne, hemp, and a
number of other hosts. In hops, one or all of the trained vines in
one hill can die off either one after the other or simultaneously.
Strict hygiene measures are necessary to minimise the likelihood of
introducing the disease into hop plantings. Some hop varieties with
disease resistance or tolerance are available.
