The 1st confirmed case of a new deadly rabbit virus has been found in a 4-month-old rabbit in Bedford. The disease is rabbit haemorrhagic disease variant 2 (RVHD-2), and it is fatal in approximately 25 percent of rabbits that catch it.

Rabbits may die suddenly without any symptoms. Until now, there had been no confirmed cases in the area, but this month [July 2017], a young rabbit that died unexpectedly at home was tested for the new virus and has become the 1st confirmed case of RVHD-2 in the Bedford area.

The standard UK rabbit vaccination does not protect against RVHD-2; it covers myxomatosis and RVHD-1.

Katharine Nelson, Senior Vet at Acorn House Veterinary Hospital, said: "Vets, pet shops and rabbit owners need to be aware that this new virus is present in the Bedford area. Both indoor and outdoor rabbits are at risk. We recommend that rabbit owners in Bedford contact their local veterinary surgery and make arrangements for their pets to receive the new vaccine."

[Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) is a highly contagious and acute fatal hepatitis of the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) caused by a calicivirus (genus _Lagovirus_). Up to 2010, all RHD viruses (RHDV) isolated belonged to one of the 6 identified genotypes (GI-GVI), among which the GVI is an antigenic subtype (RHDVa). In 2010, an additional RHDV was identified, phylogenetically and antigenically distinct from RHDV and provisionally called RHDV2 or RHDVb. A similar disease, termed European brown hare syndrome (EBHS), has been described in the hare (_Lepus europaeus_).

RHD is characterised by high morbidity and a mortality of 70-90 percent for RHDV/RHDVa and 5-70 percent for RHDV2. Infection mainly occurs by the oral route. In wild rabbits in particular, insects are considered an important route of infection or transmission, and are often the source of long-distance spread. The incubation period of RHD varies from 1 to 3 days, and death usually occurs 12-36 hours after the onset of fever. The main clinical manifestations of the acute infection are nervous and respiratory signs, apathy and anorexia. In rabbits younger than 4-6 weeks, the RHDV/RHDVa infection course is subclinical, but when the causative agent is RHDV2, clinical signs and mortality are observed even in young animals from 15 to 20 days of age onwards.

Requirements for vaccines: Indirect control of the disease is easily achieved by vaccination. Although the capsid RHDVs has been expressed as recombinant VPLs, as of 2015 the vaccines used are inactivated vaccine prepared from livers of experimentally infected rabbits, and thus inactivated and adjuvanated. Vaccinated animals quickly produce solid protective immunity against RHDV infection (within 7-10 days), and experimental data indicate that protection lasts for a long period (over 1 year). As RHDV2 is a distant antigenic subtype or even a 2nd RHDV serotype, combined vaccination with both antigenic types, or the use of a vaccine homologous to the RHDV strain identified during the epidemics or the outbreak, is highly advisable.

The above and additional information on RHD is available in OIE's terrestrial Manual chapter 2.6.2. "Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease," at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.06.02_RHD.pdf. - Mod.AS
