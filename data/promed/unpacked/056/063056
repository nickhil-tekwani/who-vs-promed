The Mission of the Community Veterinary Emergency Team [CVET] to Greece, 12-13 Apr 2016, was composed of the following experts: Dr Eeva Tuppurainen - team leader, Finland; Dr Kris de Clercq - Belgium; Commission Representative - Dr Dimitrios Dilaveris, DG SANTE [Directorate-General for Health] (only 12 Apr 2016).

SCOPE of the mission: Lumpy skin disease [LSD] in cattle in Greece

A. LSD outbreak in Nigrita, Serres on 4 Apr 2016 [This is the 1st outbreak in Greece since early December 2015]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. [Observations]
- Mixed dairy and beef herd (379 heads) vaccinated against LSDV on 26 Nov 2015
- One pregnant heifer (20 months of age) affected
- TB test in early February 2016, no lesions noticed then [see comment]
- Heifer injured when it was mounted by another animal and was separated from the herd to recover
- In early April [2016], animal was down and the owner noticed hairless patches on the back of the animal, where blackbirds were pecking
- The owner was not aware about LSDV infection
- Infected animal was sent to a slaughterhouse on [4 Apr 2016] and LSDV infection detected by the abattoir veterinarian
- The nearest abattoir is 20 km [about 12 miles] away near Neos Skopos (S131) but the animal was taken to another one located 55 km [about 34 miles] in the RU of Drama on a disease-free but vaccinated zone
- A LSDV field strain was detected from the samples by the National Reference Laboratory in Athens
- Estimated age of the skin lesions 4 weeks (based on photos taken by slaughterhouse vet)
- No clinical signs of LSD in other animals in the farm
- 40 blood samples were collected from the herd, tested negative in PCR

2. Inconclusive source of infection
- A closed, zero-grazing feedlot farming system
- Nearest outbreaks in Vrasna in November 2015, RU of Thessaloniki (25 km [about 16 miles] distance)
- All farms in Serres in close proximity of the affected region in the RU of Thessaloniki were vaccinated in late November 2015, nearly 100 percent vaccination coverage
- In the area starting 20 km to the North only 40 percent vaccination coverage
- No known animal movements from infected regions of Thessaloniki
- Movement of vaccinated animals originating from restricted regions for slaughter in the RU of Serres needs to be investigated
- No temporary farm workers
- Milk, veterinarian, animal trader vehicles -- disinfection of the wheels on arrival and exit
- Artificial insemination with frozen semen is carried out by the farmer
- Biting insects were present but not yet in substantial numbers, ticks not a problem, spot-on insect repellent in cattle
- Local feed and water

B. Hill-top beef holding near to Lithotopos village in the RU of Serres
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. [Observations]
- Located 20 km distance from Bulgarian border, free-ranging beef cattle of 70 heads, communal grazing lands also used by 4 other farmers
- Unvaccinated animals and vaccination coverage 40 percent in the mountainous region
- Clinical signs 1st noticed by the owner on Sat [9 Apr 2016], samples collected on following day and tested positive in NRL in Athens
- On the day of CVET visit on Tue [12 Apr 2016] several more cattle with skin lesions were detected
- The herd was culled on Wed [13 Apr 2016]

2. Inconclusive source of infection
- Abundance of ticks, biting flies, tabanids, mosquitos
- A spot-on insect repellent was used
- Only owners, permanent staff visit the holding regularly; state and private veterinarians irregularly
- Cattle for slaughter or trade are transported by the owner to lowland farm and are picked up from there
- Nearest abattoir (S10) is located in Hortero near Sidirokastro at 24 km [about 15 miles] distance, it's used for cattle over 72 months of age (due to TSE regulations)

C. Other affected farms by the time of CVET mission
---------------------------------------------------
- In Thessaloniki: Adverse vaccine reaction in imported cattle (68 heads) from Denmark, vaccinated [8 and 9 Mar 2016], clinical signs detected in 2 cattle 10 days post-vaccination, vaccine virus detected from the skin of the other animal
- [4 Apr 2016] a cattle farm near Roupel, Serres, very close to Bulgarian border, cattle entry point from Bulgaria to Greece, cattle resting station in close proximity -- the region was swiftly 100 percent vaccinated after the suspicion
- [12 Apr 2016] a suspected case in an unvaccinated cattle farm in Strimoniko, 13 km [about 8 miles] by beeline, 18 km [about 11 miles] by road distance from the Lithotopos hill top farm and 25 km [about 16 miles] from Nigrita farm [case A], no further data available by the time of the CVET visit

D. Recommendations
------------------
- Mass vaccination in affected regions, aiming 100 percent vaccination coverage
- Preventive vaccination campaigns should be carried out at buffer zones between affected and disease-free regions within the country and at the borders
- Movement of vaccinated cattle, originating from infected regions to a slaughterhouse within disease-free area is not recommended
- The nearest slaughterhouse within the restricted region should always be preferred
- Only healthy vaccinated animals are safe to move after the immunity has been fully established (28 days post-vaccination)
- In case it is necessary to use a slaughterhouse at the disease-free region, cattle should be inspected by a veterinarian to be free of characteristic clinical signs of LSDV on the day of transport at the farm of origin
- Animal traders and their animal facilities should be registered
- The diagnostic capacity at the NRL in Athens needs to be strengthened
- In order to investigate unnoticed LSD outbreaks in the border regions, a serological and clinical surveillance should be urgently commenced at the border zones (25 km) between Greece, Bulgaria, FYRO Macedonia
- A revision of the Council Directive 92/119/EEC is recommended in regard to stamping-out policy in vaccinated herds after full immunity [has] been established and in herds in which with a vaccine adverse reaction is detected

E. Risks involved in movement of vaccinated cattle from infected to disease-free regions for slaughter
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- In a vaccinated herd, there may been immunocompromised individual(s), that are not protected by the vaccine and therefore may get infected by a field strain
- Some animals may be accidentally missed during the vaccination campaign
- Failure in subcutaneous administration of the vaccine may occur
- Vaccine virus may be inactivated if posed to direct sunlight
- Some cattle may be already incubating the disease when vaccinated
- Consequently: unless effective risk mitigation measures are in place, even a short waiting time of infected animals showing skin lesions, kept in open animal transport vehicle on route or at the abattoir may allow sufficient time for vectors to get contaminated

[The information on the recurrence of LSD in Greece, as published by ProMED-mail on 15 Apr 2016 in the commentary of posting 20160415.4162530, follows (summarized):

"In Greece, 3 outbreaks have been reported in the Serres region, in Northern Greece, affecting unvaccinated cattle. These are the 1st outbreaks this year (2016) in Greece and are in an area which had not previously reported the disease. Greece has submitted its follow-up no. 10, including the details of the 3 new LSD outbreaks on 15 Apr 2016; see, with an interactive map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=20047. The latest previous LSD outbreak in Greece dates back to early December 2015."

Regarding the 1st new (reemerging) outbreak in Nigrita (article A above): according to the Mission's report, the estimated age of the skin lesions, photographed by the detecting abattoir veterinarian on 4 Apr 2016, was 4 weeks. This means that the estimated start of clinical disease was in early March 2016. The mission reports that TB testing was carried out in this farm "in early February 2016". Taking into consideration LSDV's incubation period (2 to 5 weeks), a possible iatrogenic infection by the tuberculination equipment deserves to be considered for inclusion among the factors discussed under "Inconclusive source of infection" in relation to the outbreak in Nigrita. - Mod.AS
