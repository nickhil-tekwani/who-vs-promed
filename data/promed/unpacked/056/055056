An [article published in the] Medical Journal of Australia [1] has unexpectedly uncovered about a certain gonorrhoea test that has been constantly used which has been resulting in incorrect positive results.

Dr Eric Chow who has lead a team of researchers from the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre [MSHC], Monash University, Royal Women's Hospital Melbourne and University of Melbourne, has discovered that the [rapid increase of gonorrhoea notifications in Victoria, Australia, which had tripled between 2008 and 2013, identified by nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), was not confirmed by results of culture.]

"There was no observable increase in the proportion of women diagnosed with gonorrhea by culture at the MSHC, or in the proportion of notifications per reported (Medicare Benefits Schedule) item numbers for dual NAAT in Victoria," the team of researchers had noted.

"Taken collectively, these data suggest that the prevalence of gonorrhea among women remains very low and stable in Victoria (0.2 percent-0.3 percent) and at the MSHC (0.4 percent-0.6 percent), and that the rise in notifications is likely due to false-positive results arising from the increased use of NAATs in a low prevalence population, with potential for unnecessary treatment of patients and partners and consequent harm."

[In a] Medical Journal of Australia editorial [2], Dr Katy Bell and co-authors [said:]
"Two factors which may partly account for the increase in testing are ... clinicians misinterpreting guidelines as meaning that opportunistic screening should be done for both infections [that is, gonorrhea and chlamydia infection], and ... use of dual NAATs by laboratories to test for both infections, even when clinicians have only requested chlamydia testing. The psychological consequences of false-positive test results are substantial. They include anxiety and depression, feelings of guilt and self-blame, loss of self-esteem and self-confidence, feelings of social isolation, and existential concerns."

A recommendation that was given by the research team and also from the editorial that limiting routine screening to higher-risk populations with higher underlying rates of infection was considered a way to deal with the situation.

Abstract
--------
"Objectives: To examine whether the rapid increase of gonorrhoea notifications in Victoria, Australia, identified by nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) is supported by similar changes in diagnoses by culture, which has higher specificity, and to determine the proportion of tests positive among women tested.

"Design, setting and participants: Retrospective analysis of Medicare reporting of dual NAATs in Victoria, Victorian Department of Health gonorrhoea notifications, and gonorrhoea culture data at the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre (MSHC), among women, 2008 to 2013.

"Main outcome measures: Gonorrhoea notifications and testing methods.

"Results: Gonorrhoea cases identified by NAAT increased from 98 to 343 cases over the study period. Notifications by culture alone decreased from 19 to 5 cases. The proportion of NAATs positive for gonorrhoea in Victoria was low (0.2 percent-0.3 percent) and did not change over time (P for trend, 0.66). Similarly, the proportion of women tested at the MSHC for gonorrhoea who tested positive (0.4 percent-0.6 percent) did not change over time (P for trend, 0.70). Of untreated women who had a positive NAAT result for gonorrhoea and were referred to the MSHC, 10/25 were confirmed by culture.

"Conclusions: The positivity of gonorrhoea in women identified by culture remains stable over time. Using NAAT for gonorrhoea screening in low-prevalence populations will result in many false positives. Positive NAAT results among low-risk women should be regarded as doubtful, and confirmatory cultures should be performed."

Gonococcal infections are typically asymptomatic in women until complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) develop. In men, the majority of urethral infections cause urethritis with painful urination, urethral discharge, and, less commonly, epididymitis or disseminated gonococcal infection.

Culture for _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ was long the reference standard diagnostic test. Of the nonculture tests available, only nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) that amplifies and detects _N. gonorrhoeae_-specific, as well as _Chlamydia trachomatis_-specific, nucleic acid sequences has been recommended by the CDC for routine use.

The positive predictive value (PPV) of a diagnostic test is the proportion of positive results that are really true positive results (true positives/true positives + false positives). PPV is the probability that a positive test actually indicates the patient really has the specified condition. However, the PPV varies with the prevalence of the condition in the population tested, as well as the sensitivity and specificity of the test. If the population of people tested includes a high proportion of people with the condition, then the PPV will be high, but when using a test with less than 100 percent specificity in a low prevalence population, the PPV will be much lower.

For example, a new screening test with 90 percent sensitivity and 95 percent specificity is used in a million people where the prevalence of the condition is only 1 percent (10 000 people). The new test with 90 percent sensitive will detect 9000 who actually have the condition (true positives). In those 990 000 in population without the condition, the new test with 95 percent specificity finds 49 500 individuals to be positive by the new test (false positives). The PPV (true positives/true positives + false positives) is thus only 15 percent. If this new test were used in a population where 50 percent of the population has the condition, the PPV would be 95 percent. As the authors of this article and the accompanying editorial point out, use of a screening test in a low prevalence population may thus lead to unintended problems.

In this regard the CDC cautions (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6302a1.htm):
"The prevalence of gonorrhea varies widely among communities and populations; health-care providers should consider local gonorrhea epidemiology when making screening decisions. Although widespread screening is not recommended, targeted screening of young women (that is, those aged 25 years and younger) at increased risk for infection is a primary component of gonorrhea control in the United States because gonococcal infections among women are frequently asymptomatic. For sexually active women, including those who are pregnant, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that clinicians provide gonorrhea screening only to those at increased risk for infection (such as, women with previous gonorrhea infection, other STDs, new or multiple sex partners, and inconsistent condom use; those who engage in commercial sex work and drug use; women in certain demographic groups; and those living in communities with a high prevalence of disease). USPSTF does not recommend screening for gonorrhea in women who are at low risk for infection."

Victoria, in southeastern Australia, is the country's 2nd-most populous state. Most of its population of over 5.7 million is concentrated in the area surrounding Port Phillip Bay, which includes the metropolitan area of its capital and largest city, Melbourne, Australia's 2nd-largest city (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)). - Mod.ML]
