Holding a joint press conference in Diyarbakir, health organizations have announced that a 10-year-old child has lost his or her life because of anthrax. The Diyarbakir Chamber of Medicine, Diyarbakir Chamber of Veterinary Surgeons, Diyarbakir Chamber of Dentists, and Health and Social Service Laborers' Union Diyarbakir Branch (SES) organized a joint press conference to report on people diagnosed with anthrax, as well as their medical condition, quarantine, number of imported animals and where they were distributed to.

According to Hatice Kamer from BBC News Turkey, it was stated at the press conference that a 10-year-old child lost his or her life because of anthrax in Turkey's eastern province of Bitlis. The following statements were made at the joint statement:

"[The death] of the child has increased our concerns."
"[The death] of a 10-year-old child from Guroymak, Bitlis has increased our concerns regarding anthrax. Our concerns and worries increase more considering the rumors that the imported meats causing anthrax [are available in markets]."
"[Veterinarians] have been removed from task of inspection."
"As per the regulation dated [28 Apr 2018], the obligation of veterinary inspection on imported animals was lifted, and the authorization was granted to agricultural engineers, forest engineers and chemistry engineers."

Bitlis' Gunkiri municipality in the district of Guroymak has been put under quarantine since the anthrax was detected on 6 Sep [2018]. It was stated that all bovines would be vaccinated in the district and villages to prevent anthrax from spreading to places close to the town. As many as 100 animals had died in the town.

[To put this Turkish situation into context, OIE has reported the following for Turkey: In the first 6 months of 2018, livestock anthrax has already been reported in 25 provinces. In 2017, there were 99 outbreaks involving cattle in which 590 animals died, and 9 ovine outbreaks with 155 sheep deaths. In that year [2017], only 2 percent of cattle were vaccinated and less than 0.5 percent of sheep and goats. There were no equine outbreaks. The Turkish veterinary reporting to OIE of livestock outbreaks and cases is reliable. A total of 37 human cases were reported but no deaths in 2017. In the past (i.e., 2005 and earlier), there would be 320 to 690 human cases each year; more recently, the situation is much improved although variable -- 32 to 197 cases. Anthrax is patently a serious human and livestock problem in this country, which is economically and politically stressed. Niche modelling shows that some 75 percent of the country is at serious risk. Put another way, if a livestock national control and surveillance programme were to be initiated, some 80 percent of the cattle would have to be vaccinated annually for at least 10 years before targeted area vaccination could be used to tidy up. - Mod.MHJ
