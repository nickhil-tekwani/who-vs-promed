[In April 2015, Hong Kong reported for the 1st time highly pathogenic avian influenza subtype H5N6. See comments in ProMED-mail post 20150417.3302296.

Gene sequencing for both the April 2015 finding as well as this finding are still pending.

The oriental magpie-robin (_Copsychus saularis_) is a small passerine bird that was formerly classed as a member of the thrush family Turdidae but is now considered an Old World flycatcher. They are distinctive black and white birds with a long tail that is held upright as they forage on the ground or perch conspicuously. Occurring across most of the Indian subcontinent and parts of Southeast Asia, they are common birds in urban gardens as well as forests. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriental_magpie-robin. - Mod.CRD
