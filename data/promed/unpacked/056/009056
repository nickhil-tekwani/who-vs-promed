At least 4 people have been confirmed dead and 12 hospitalized after students of the College of Education, Waka-Biu in Biu Local Government Area of Borno State returned from a Yankari Games Reserve field trip. According to witnesses who spoke to Premium Times on [the] phone from Biu, those that lost their lives complained of abdominal pains after which they vomited blood. Initially, the death toll was put at 9, a figure which the Provost of the school, Mohammed Audu, said was incorrect.

Biu has been thrown into confusion in the last few days as the strange illness continues to affect mainly students of the institution. One of the dead students is the daughter of the caretaker chairman of Biu Local Government Area. The Borno State Deputy Governor, Umar Kadafur, who hails from Biu, has also confirmed the development.

Speaking through his Press Secretary, Bulama Alkali, the deputy governor, said the Borno State health ministry and the federal ministry of health have been directed to investigate the matter. "For now the deputy governor may not have ample information that will enable him [to] make [an] informed comment on the matter," said Mr. Alkali. "However the deputy governor, just like any other parent, is very much saddened and concerned about the development," he added.

The College Provost, Mr. Audu, said the students were on holiday at the time they embarked on the field trip to Yankari. He said the "school was closed for the season on 10 Aug 2019. But the students had to return to the campus to embark on the excursion because it was already planned, and they had to go for the trip as part of their course work."

He said the field trip was done in 3 batches, and the last batch that encountered the problem was "batch C" who travelled on 21 Aug 2019 and returned a day later. The excursion has been an annual event for students, he said. "When they returned, they left for their homes and there was no issue until Saturday, 31 Aug 2019, when the daughter of [the] Biu local government chairman died," he said. The provost said even when the female student died, her death was not immediately linked with the Yankari trip.

"People began to raise eyebrows some days after when 3 other students who were in the same trip batch died after exhibiting similar health conditions," he said. Mr. Audu said tension began to mount when more of the students fell ill. "Of the 4 that died, 2 were not our students but the commercial photographers that usually accompany the students on such trips," he said. One of the photographers was said to be asthmatic.

The provost explained that he wrote to the General Hospital in Biu alerting the Principal Medical Officer (PMO) of the situation in the college following the death of one of the students. He said he also alerted the state government, which deployed an emergency medical response team to Biu from Maiduguri. "Meanwhile, the PMO in Biu had mobilized his team to the school after all the students on the last batch that contracted the unknown disease were summoned back to the campus," Mr. Audu said.

Mr. Audu said the students were questioned on the kind of food they ate and the water they drank. "Most of them said they couldn't eat the food sold in Yankari because [it was] very expensive, but they all said they swam in the stream there. The PMO assured them that though the strange ailment has no signs of being communicable, it's root cause has to be verified in a laboratory test."

The provost informed Premium Times that some of the students that were examined exhibited symptoms of being ill. A total of 12 of them were not feeling very well, and the medics gave them some medication and asked them to return for further medical examination by the medical team from Maiduguri. "However, the PMO had to refer 3 of the ill with more severe case[s] of ailment to be admitted at the hospital," he said.

Efforts to contact the Borno State health commissioner and his counterpart in the ministry of higher education were not successful, as they could not be reached on their known mobile lines.

Premium Times gathered that the Waka Biu students' travail may not have been isolated. One of the medical personnel was quoted to have said that a similar case was reported in Kano after a set of students from the Northwest state visited Yankari reserve on the same day, 21 Aug 2019.

Although Premium Times has not independently verified that piece of information, the medical personnel feel strongly that the strange illness has a lot to do with the popular games reserve. The medical team from Maiduguri is expected to reexamine the students.

[The etiology of these illnesses is unclear. With the bleeding, a viral hemorrhagic fever such as Lassa or yellow fever could be considered. ProMED would appreciate any information regarding this outbreak.

Yankari National Park (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankari_National_Park) is a large wildlife park located in the south-central part of Bauchi State, in northeastern Nigeria. It covers an area of about 2244 square km (866 sq mi) and is home to several natural warm water springs, as well as a wide variety of flora and fauna. Its location in the heartland of the West African savanna makes it a unique way for tourists and holidaymakers to watch wildlife in its natural habitat. Yankari was originally created as a game reserve in 1956 but later designated Nigeria's biggest national park in 1991. It is the most popular destination for tourists in Nigeria and, as such, plays a crucial role in the development and promotion of tourism and ecotourism in Nigeria. It is also one of the most popular eco-destinations in West Africa. - Mod.LL
