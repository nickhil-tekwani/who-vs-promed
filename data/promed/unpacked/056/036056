A new mutant blood-sucking tick has been discovered in Russia amid a surge in tick bite victims, according to official government papers.

In one region of Siberia, there is reportedly 428 times more ticks than usual, reports from the Russian Defense Ministry's own newspaper suggest.

And scientists have now reportedly discovered a mutant form of the arachnid, which is said to have the worst qualities of 2 common forms of ticks found in Russia.

The news has also sparked growing fears that hospitals in sparsely populated Siberia are running out of vaccines and medications for the types of diseases which ticks can inflict on the humans they bite. These include [tick-borne] encephalitis -- an inflammation of the brain which is estimated to have killed more than 150 000 in 2015 -- and the often debilitating, if left untreated, Lyme disease.

The scale of the tick population has left some hospitals, already stretched with rising numbers of coronavirus deaths and infections, without vaccines and medications.

In the Krasnoyarsk region, in central Russia, medics report 8215 tick bite cases, including 2125 involving children.

The suburbs of Krasnoyarsk city are infested with 214 ticks per square km [0.38 sq miles], compared with the safe figure of 0.5.

Almost 2 percent carry tick-borne viral encephalitis [virus], which can lead to permanent brain damage, with a 3rd capable of passing on tick-borne borreliosis, or Lyme disease, attacking the joints, heart, and nervous system, reports the region's Epidemiology and Hygiene Centre.

Several Siberian regions have been hit with large numbers of hybrid ticks, reported Zvezda, the Russian defense ministry's newspaper.

Among the report includes mention of a mutant tick, which combines the worst qualities of 2 common types of Russian tick, _Ixodes persulcatus_, the taiga tick, and the malicious Pavlovsky or Far Eastern tick.

"Mutant ticks are attacking. This is not a tabloid headline but a fact," stated its report.

The ticks latch on to humans from both long and short grass before finding a place to bite their victims, from which they suck blood.

A large number of inter-species hybrids, which produce fertile offspring, have invaded Novosibirsk and Tomsk regions, said Dr Nina Tikhunova, of the Institute of Chemical Biology and Fundamental Medicine, Novosibirsk.

The mild winter is seen as a key reason for the rise in tick numbers. The mutant tick is capable of carrying infectious agents associated with both parent species. The resulting tick bites are very unpleasant for people, she said.

Everyone bitten by a tick must seek medical help to check whether the creature is infected.

Novosibirsk has seen a 150 per cent jump in people seeking medical help after suffering bites from abnormally active ticks, which bite beneath the skin into blood vessels.

There are 22 people who have been hospitalised suspected of encephalitis.

In Sverdlovsk region in the Urals, 17 242 people have been bitten by ticks, among them 4334 children, with 36 per cent said to have Lyme disease.

The rise in figures come despite Russians, until recently, being under lockdown over coronavirus. Many cities say they have no stocks of immunoglobulin to treat sufferers, or only enough for children.

Khabarovsk region says it is has run out of immunoglobulin and encephalitis vaccine. New supplies are only expected in July [2020], with people urged to stay home.

In Kemerovo region, SG from Prokopyevsk urgently needed an injection of immunoglobulin but could not find supplies in the city. It should be injected no more than 4 days after the bite.

[A 2015 report in Infection, Genetics and Evolution Volume 32, June 2015, Pages 388-395 indicated that natural hybridization between _Ixodes persulcatus_ and _Ixodes pavlovski_ occurs in nature in western Siberia, where the above tick infestation is occurring (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1567134815001288). The transmission efficiency of tick-borne encephalitis virus by this hybrid, compared to the parent species, is not reported. The parent ticks are vectors of Lyme Borreliosis and tick-borne encephalitis virus.

This is the season of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus transmission in Russia. Russia, especially western Siberia, has the largest number of reported TBE cases. For additional details on TBE, see Mod.LL's extensive comments drawn from the US CDC (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/travel-related-infectious-diseases/tickborne-encephalitis). The CDC information notes that in Russia, 2 inactivated TBE vaccines are available: TBE-Moscow (Chumakov Institute, Russia) and EnceVir (Microgen, Russia). The European and Russian vaccines should provide cross-protection against all 3 TBEV subtypes. Vaccine failures have been reported, particularly in people aged over 50 years. - Mod.TY
