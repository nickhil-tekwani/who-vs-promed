In the last 6 weeks 40 people have died across the country from the outbreak of Lassa fever. So far, 397 cases have been reported and all patients are to be treated free. This was disclosed in a statement by the minister of health, Prof Onyebuchi Chukwu, yesterday [21 Feb 2012]. The minister said that 6 of the dead were health workers (2 doctors and 4 nurses) and that cases have been reported in 12 states Edo, Nasarawa, Plateau, Ebonyi, Taraba, Yobe, Ondo, Rivers, Gombe, Anambra, Delta, and Lagos.

Out of the 397 cases reported, only 87 cases have been positively confirmed by medical officials. Chukwu narrated the case of a 28-year-old female corps member who completed her 3 weeks orientation in Rivers State but travelled home to visit her families in Afikpo and Abakiliki, capital of Ebonyi State, where she contracted the fever on 1 Jan 2012 and died 2 days later.

On what the Ministry is doing to contain the situation, Chukwu said adequate quantities of ribavirin injections and tablets, the specific antiviral drug for Lassa fever, have been released to the affected states. He also said that the ministry has deployed rapid response teams to all affected states and there is great emphasis on routine barrier nursing precautions. Chukwu added that no travel restriction will be imposed on the affected areas but hotlines have been provided for health workers for expert advice. The numbers are: 08037154575, 08023214998, 08037879701, and 08023047101.

However, the minister of state for health, Dr Muhammad Ali Pate, in a media conference yesterday [21 Feb 2012], said the ministry has also distributed over 750 000 ribavirin doses of injection and tablets as well as safety gloves and protective vests for health workers. He said that there are 9 specialist centres across Nigeria where tests on Lassa fever can be done. Pate advised Nigerians not to panic as the government is responding promptly and effectively to the outbreak.

Lassa fever is a viral disease that attacks the liver, nervous system, spleen, and kidney, causing them to bleed, hence the haemorrhagic fever designation. According to the online encyclopaedia Wikipedia, Lassa fever was first described in 1969 in the town of Lassa, in Borno State, Nigeria, in the Yedseram river valley at the south end of Lake Chad. It is an infection that is endemic in the West African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and even Central African Republic and Congo DR. About 300 000 to 500 000 cases occur annually, with approximately 5000 deaths. Symptoms of Lassa fever include fever, retrosternal pain (pain behind the chest wall), sore throat, back pain, cough, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, conjunctivitis, facial swelling, proteinuria (protein in the urine), and mucosal bleeding, bleeding from the mouth, nose, vagina, or gastrointestinal tract and low blood pressure.

The virus lives in rats and infects humans when they come in contact with these rats' urine and faeces. Pate explained that increasing awareness is being created for Nigerians to avoid rats and keep them away from stored food and drinking water. People living in rural areas or in crowded and unsanitary environments, where rats breed, are at the greatest risk. However, health experts warn that Lassa fever can be contracted through body fluids like blood and excrements of infected persons.

[About 80 percent of human infections are asymptomatic; the remaining cases have severe multi-system disease, where the virus affects several organs in the body, such as the liver, spleen, and kidneys. Lassa fever is a zoonotic disease. The animal reservoir of Lassa virus is a rodent of the genus _Mastomys_, commonly known as the "multimammate rat". _Mastomys_ infected with Lassa virus do not become ill, but they can shed the virus in their excreta.

Humans usually become infected with Lassa virus from exposure to excreta of infected _Mastomys_ rats. Lassa virus may also be spread between humans through direct contact with the blood, urine, faeces, or other bodily secretions of a person with Lassa fever. There is no epidemiological evidence supporting airborne spread between humans. Person-to-person transmission occurs in both community and health care settings, where the virus may be spread by contaminated medical equipment, such as re-used needles. Sexual transmission of Lassa virus has been reported.

Lassa fever occurs in all age groups and in both men and women. Persons at greatest risk are those living in rural areas where _Mastomys_ rats are usually found, especially in areas of poor sanitation or crowded living conditions. Health care workers are at risk if proper barrier nursing and infection control practices are not maintained. Because the symptoms of Lassa fever are so varied and non-specific, clinical diagnosis is often difficult, especially early in the course of the disease. Lassa fever is difficult to distinguish from many other diseases that cause fever, including malaria, shigellosis, typhoid fever, yellow fever, and other viral haemorrhagic fevers.

This outbreak of Lassa haemorrhagic fever is remarkable in its extent, initially being reported from Ebonyi state only on 18 Jan 2012 and now apparently affecting 12 of the 36 states of Nigeria.
