Bovine tuberculosis was recently confirmed in a small beef herd in Alpena County. This herd, which is the 74th cattle herd to be identified with bovine TB in Michigan since 1998, was identified through routine surveillance testing.

Bovine TB, a bacterial disease primarily affecting cattle, is endemic in the free-ranging white-tailed deer population in Michigan's modified accredited zone (MAZ). The MAZ is a U.S. Department of Agriculture designation for Alcona, Alpena, Montmorency and Oscoda counties. In the MAZ, contact with deer can be a potential source of bovine TB infection for cattle. Preventing deer from having access to cattle feed, feed storage, or watering areas is crucial for farmers in this area of Michigan and is a part of the wildlife biosecurity program overseen by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and its partners.

As part of MDARD's (Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development) standard disease response, an investigation will be conducted to identify and test herds that had an association with the infected herd. In the MAZ, annual surveillance and movement testing are required of cattle producers, which helps detect disease early and prevent it from being moved off the farm.

"Although a great deal of work is being done by producers in this area of the state, MDARD, the Department of Natural Resources, and partner agencies to prevent bovine TB cases, we do still occasionally see newly infected herds," said Michigan's Assistant State Veterinarian Nancy Barr, DVM. "Responding to them in an effective manner helps prevent further cases and protect the state's TB free status in the remainder of the state. MDARD and the DNR are working with farmers, hunters, and community members to preserve and maintain healthy cattle, healthy deer and healthy communities."

Any questions about this herd can be directed to the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development at 800-292-3939, and more information on bovine TB can be found at http://www.michigan.gov/bovinetb.

[Tuberculosis is circulating in the cattle herds in Michigan. Cattle and cervids (deer, elk) often have contact with cattle. As the hunting season is upon those in many areas, this should serve as a reminder to be on the lookout for unusual things, such as large lymph nodes or necrotic areas or other abnormalities in your animal when field dressing the animal. It should also serve as a reminder to take along some disposable gloves for use during this process. These gloves are a protective measure for you.

"Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease of both animals and humans. Bovine TB, caused by _M. bovis_, can be transmitted from livestock to humans and other animals.

"The cooperative federal-state-industry effort to eradicate bovine TB from cattle in the USA has made significant progress since the program's inception in 1917. The disease has nearly been eliminated from the livestock population of the USA. Many consider this one of the great animal- and public-health achievements in the USA. However, our ultimate goal of eradication remains elusive as animal-health officials continue to detect TB sporadically in livestock herds.

"Signs
-----
Q. What is bovine tuberculosis (TB)?
A. Bovine TB is a contagious, chronic bacterial disease caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_. The infection commonly involves the lungs, but it may spread to other organs. Animals often don't show signs until the infection has reached an advanced stage.

Q. What animals can it affect?
A. Bovine TB primarily affects cattle, but it can be transmitted to any warm-blooded animal, including people.

Q. What are the clinical signs of bovine TB?
A. Bovine TB is difficult to diagnose with clinical signs alone. In the early stages of TB, clinical signs are not visible. In later stages, clinical signs may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade fever, and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. Lymph nodes may also be enlarged.

Q. What should I do if my animals show these clinical signs?
A. If you suspect TB in your herd, you should isolate the animal immediately and then call your veterinarian for a proper diagnosis.

Q. How does TB get into cattle herds
A: TB can be introduced into a herd by infected animals or people. In the USA, the 2 most common methods of introduction are

- the purchase of or exposure to infected cattle; or
- the exposure to infected free-ranging wildlife.

"The bacterium that causes bovine TB is found in the saliva of infected animals and spreads through airborne particles from the respiratory tract. The bacteria can also spread through feed or watering sites contaminated with saliva and other bodily discharges (urine, manure) or by drinking raw, unpasteurized milk from infected animals. The risk of exposure is greatest in enclosed areas, such as in barns with poor ventilation."
