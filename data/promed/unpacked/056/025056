Situation update
-----------------
Between 14 and 20 Aug 2020, EU Member States reported 34 human cases of WNV [West Nile virus] infection: Italy (17), Greece (11), and Spain (6). One case was reported from the province of Verbano-Cusio-Ossola, Italy, which had not been affected in previous transmission seasons. All other cases were reported from areas that have been affected during previous transmission seasons. This week, no deaths were reported. No human cases of WNV infection or deaths were reported from EU neighbouring countries.

Spain is currently experiencing an outbreak of WNV infection in the province of Seville. Six confirmed human cases reported through TESSy (see above) and an additional 13 probable cases are being further investigated. As these probable cases have not yet been reported through TESSy, they are not included in the list of the cases in the Surveillance Atlas. Additional patients with meningo-encephalitis are currently being tested.

Since the beginning of the 2020 transmission season and as of 20 Aug 2020, EU Member States have reported 66 human cases of WNV infection and 6 deaths through The European Surveillance System (TESSy): Greece (39, including 6 deaths), Italy (19), Spain (6), and Romania (2). One case was reported from the province of Verbano-Cusio-Ossola, Italy, which had not been affected in previous transmission seasons. All other cases were reported from areas that have been affected during previous transmission seasons. No cases have been reported from EU neighbouring countries.

Since the beginning of the 2020 transmission season, 19 outbreaks among equids have been reported. These outbreaks have been reported by Spain (16, including 9 in the province of Seville), Italy (2), and Portugal (1) through the Animal Disease Notification System (ADNS) of the European Commission. No outbreaks among birds have been reported through ADNS.

[2] Outbreak in Spain
Date: Fri 21 Aug 2020 08:30 EDT

A 77-year-old resident of La Puebla del Rio on Thursday [20 Aug 2020] became the 1st victim of an outbreak of West Nile virus in the southern Spanish province of Seville after succumbing to meningoencephalitis. According to Spanish TV network Telecinco and family sources who confirmed the news to news agency EFE, the patient had been in intensive care in the Virgen del Rocio hospital in the Andalusian capital. On Friday [21 Aug 2020], an 85-year-old woman in Seville became the 2nd person to die from the virus.

A total of 38 people have so far been infected during the biggest West Nile outbreak ever detected in Andalusia, which has affected the areas of Coria del Rio and La Puebla del Rio, both located on the banks of the Guadalquivir River. Of these, 23 people have been hospitalized, with 7 of the patients in intensive care, according to the regional health department. The average age of those infected in the outbreak is 60, and 71% of the victims are men.

The virus has been spread by mosquitos, which are common in the area given the proximity to the river. The insect numbers have grown by 30% this year [2020] compared to 2019 due to the intense rainfall registered in spring, according to data from the Donana Biological Station. The virus travels thanks to migratory birds, which are bitten by mosquitos, who then transmit it to horses and humans via new bites.

The virus, which is transmitted by the common _Culex_ mosquito, causes a death rate of 0.1% among those infected, inflammation of the meninges and the brain (meningoencephalitis) among 1%, and a controllable fever among 20%. In 80% of cases, the virus is asymptomatic, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

In response to the outbreak, the Andalusian health department last week recommended that the 42 000 residents of the areas in question take measures to avoid mosquitoes, such as the use of repellents and nets, and activated a special protocol, which includes fumigations.

The affected area has recently been falling victim to a long list of calamities. Last year [2019], Seville was the site of the largest listeria outbreak in Spain's history, with 222 cases, 3 deaths, and 7 miscarriages. In January [2020], residents of Coria del Rio discovered that the municipal sewage system was releasing toxic gasses that were harmful to human health. In mid-March [2020], the area -- like the rest of Spain -- was placed under a strict lockdown in a bid to curb the spread of COVID-19, and now the West Nile virus is threatening to destroy the local economy just as it was starting to recover from the confinement measures.

[West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that is widespread in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and southern Europe, where it causes outbreaks and sporadic cases of the disease. It has become an emergent disease in North America, where it was detected for the 1st time in 1999 and became epidemic shortly thereafter.

According to the Eurosurveillance data, European Union (EU) Member States and EU neighbouring countries reported 463 human infections with WNV and 50 deaths in 2019. No cases were reported from Spain (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/west-nile-fever/surveillance-and-disease-data/historical).

This is the 2nd update on the WNV outbreak in Spain. The 1st report was published on 16 Aug 2020 (West Nile virus (07): Europe, ECDC update, Spain: 20200816.7665472). The above report describes at least 38 confirmed cases in Andalusia region, with 23 hospitalized cases and one death. In 2016, a WNV outbreak was reported in this region that resulted in 3 human cases and a well-coordinated public health response with establishment of the control measures under the Epidemiology Andalusian Surveillance System (SVEA) WNV protocols (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5894251/).

Since WNV outbreaks in animals precede human cases, the establishment of an active animal-health surveillance system to detect new cases in birds and horses is essential in providing early warning for veterinary and human public health authorities. Vaccines have been developed for horses.

Early detection and description of human cases in areas where virus circulation has been previously identified is essential for establishing prevention and control measures. A multidisciplinary approach involving trained and well-informed physicians, veterinarians, and other allied professionals is necessary. Likewise, it is also fundamental to identify the affected territory in order to adopt the appropriate control measures. This allows early detection of cases and prompt escalation of appropriate control measures that are implemented at the beginning of the vector season. In the absence of a vaccine, the only way to reduce infection in people is by raising awareness of the risk factors and educating people about the measures they can take to reduce exposure to the virus.

Public health educational messages should focus on the following:
- Reducing the risk of mosquito transmission. Efforts to prevent transmission should first focus on personal and community protection against mosquito bites through the use of mosquito nets and personal insect repellent, by wearing light-coloured clothing (long-sleeved shirts and trousers), and by avoiding outdoor activity at peak biting times. In addition, community programmes should encourage communities to destroy mosquito breeding sites in residential areas.
- Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission. Gloves and other protective clothing should be worn while handling sick animals or their tissues and during slaughtering and culling procedures.
- Reducing the risk of transmission through blood transfusion and organ transplant. Blood and organ donation restrictions and laboratory testing should be considered at the time of the outbreak in the affected areas after assessing the local/regional epidemiological situation (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/west-nile-virus). - Mod.UBA
