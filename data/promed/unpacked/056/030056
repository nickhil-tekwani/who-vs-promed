Update - Imported Lassa fever - Germany ex Nigeria
Three weeks after a 57-year old Nigerian suffering from Lassa fever (which
was only diagnosed after his death, he had been flown in from Nigeria with
an unclear neurologic illness and no clinical evidence of VHF) died at a
Wiesbaden hospital from a pulmonary embolism, all 103 contacts (90 hospital
staff and 13 other such as visitors, ambulance personnel and undertakers)
who had been under close surveillance have remained healthy and
sero-negative including one nurse who had been isolated. The Minister for
Social Affairs of the State of Hesse (Germany) had always denied any risk
for the population but stressed the necessity to have a central facility in
this state for the isolation and management of dangerous contagious
diseases (which has been in planning for Frankfurt am Main University
Hospital for some time and will hopefully be implemented soon).
