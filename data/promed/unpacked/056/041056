Isingiro Chairman LCV [local council V] Jeremiah Kamurali has attributed the increase of Rift Valley fever in the district to the growing number of refugees entering Isingiro. Kamurali yesterday [12 Aug 2018] met with journalists at Little Woods in Mbarara town [Mbarara district].

Kamurali said Isingiro is one of the most affected districts because of its geographical location bordering with Tanzania, Rwanda, and crossing Lake Mburo national park. He also reported that several people have died because of the epidemic in the area. "We have already buried some of the important people on the team fighting Rift Valley fever; we lost [J], who was Commandant of Orukiinga Refuge Settlement, and many others," said Kamurali.

Mbarara District Health Officer (DHO) Dr. Peter Ssebutinde reported that the disease has crossed to the districts of Isingiro, Kiruhura, Sembabule, Mbarara, Ibanda, and Kasese. He described signs of hemorrhagic fever as severe headache, stomach pain, vomiting, among others, adding that it kills a person within 6 days when he/she receives no treatment. Chairman Kamurali reported that the epidemic crossed to Isingiro on [26 Jun 2018] but has spread rampantly for the past 3 days [10-12 Aug 2018]. He added that the District Emergency Team was formed to make an isolation centre to treat the infected patients and report new outbreaks within the district.

"One was put at Rwekubo and another will be put at Kashojo health centre 3 in the middle of Nakivale settlement [Isingiro district]." However, he said the isolation camps are not stocked with drugs.

"We are seeking intervention from NHCR, UNICEF, and the Health Ministry to give us drugs to contain the disease." Among the heavily affected subcounties include Kashumba, Orukiinga, and Isingiro and Sheema.

Blood samples that were taken to Kampala show that out of the 50 cattle, 23 were found infected with Rift Valley fever in Isingiro district. In humans, out of 28 suspected cases, 19 were discharged, 6 died, and the others are recovering. The Director Mbarara Referral Hospital Dr. Celestine Barigye said the disease is being contained, and most of the patients will be discharged; however, he said he will provide Chimp Reports with complete statistics of the disease in the western region.

[No evidence is provided supporting the blame of incoming refugees for the increase in Rift Valley fever (RVF) cases. If the refugees are bringing infected livestock with them, there might be some substance for the claim. However, large areas of Uganda and eastern Africa have undergone heavy rains and flooding, providing extensive breeding sites for RVF virus vector mosquitoes. The loss of human and livestock life is indeed unfortunate. There is no mention made about issuance of precautionary warnings to the public for handling or slaughtering ill animals to prevent RVF virus transmission or imposing a halt to movement of animals out of the affected areas. Personal protective equipment should be used by healthcare providers. - Mod.TY
