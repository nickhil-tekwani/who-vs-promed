Panic has gripped the people of different costal villages of Kujang
and Erasama blocks after detection of chikungunya [virus or antibody?
- Mod.TY] from the blood samples of affected people.

Sources said that hundreds of people from Chauta, Pokharipada under
Erasama and Sahada village under Kujang block have been suffering
from an unknown fever and disease. A medical team collected blood
samples of 15 suspected cases from these villages. Blood samples were
sent to SCB [Shri Ramachandra Bhanj] Medical College and hospital,
Cuttack for examination, which has detected chikungunya virus [or
antibody?] in these patients. Meanwhile, many villagers have been
admitted in different Primary Health Centers (PHCs) for the treatment
of chikungunya [virus infections].

"Chikungunya [virus] is spreading in the village as the authorities
have failed to provide potable water to the people. Due to shortage
of unsafe drinking water, many costal villagers are being compelled
to drink polluted water from the ponds and rivers, causing spread of
dengue and chikungunya [virus infections] in these villages.
[Consuming polluted water from ponds and rivers per se is not
responsible for dengue and chikungunya virus infections. However, if
the unavailability of safe household water is leading to a water
storage in and immediately around houses, this practice is probably
leading to abundant breeding sites for _Aedes aegypti_, the mosquito
vector of both viruses. - Mod.TY]

Panic gripped the village and its nearby areas after a plumber of the
village returned from Kolkota and other states suffering from an
unknown disease. Within a short span, hundreds of villagers including
children suffered from the same disease suspected to be chikungunya
[virus infection]. Many villagers were suffering from fever and joint
pains, which are symptoms of chikungunya. However, a team of doctors,
after visiting the areas, opines that few persons could be classified
as suffering from chikungunya disease, and other patients were
suffering from malaria and water-borne diseases.

[In] the [15] blood samples [from patients], which have been sent to
SCB medical college and hospital, Cuttack, chikungunya virus has been
detected. Similarly, a medical team has also collected blood samples
of another 6 persons of Chatua village to send to Cuttack for
examination today [18 Dec 2010].

Chief District Medical Officer Mr Rabindranath Das has said that
mosquitoes are the main cause of the spread of chikungunya [virus] in
these villages. Medical teams have been pressed into service to give
these villages awareness about these diseases and preventive
measures. All the collected blood samples will be sent to the Indian
Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Bhubaneswer for further
examination and diagnosis of the disease," added Dr Das.

[This year (2010), there have been chikungunya virus infections in
Delhi, Tamil Nadu, and Maharashtra states, and now Orissa state. It
will be of interest to find out how many of these presumptive
chikungunya virus infection cases in Orissa are actually caused by
this virus, and if dengue viruses are circulating in these areas as
well. There are no vaccines or anti-viral drugs available to prevent
or treat chikungunya virus infections, so only palliative treatment
is available. The most effective measure to reduce this outbreak is
elimination or larvicidal treatment of water catchments where the
vector mosquitoes are breeding.
