Cholera
Zaire (14 April 1997).
A confirmed cholera outbreak has been reported in the Kasese refugee camp
near Kisangani in Haut-Zaire Province. A WHO team in Kisangani together with
teams from Medecins sans Frontieres and UNICEF are currently assisting in
the urgent measures required for the control of this outbreak.
Since the beginning of 1997 suspected cholera outbreaks have been reported
in several regions of Zaire, particularly Kinshasa and Equateur Provinces.
Cholera treatment kits have been sent to Kinshasa and a WHO consultant is
visiting the area affected this week.
