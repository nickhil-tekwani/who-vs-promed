Animals at the 2nd Surrey farm to be diagnosed with foot-and-mouth
[FMD] last week may have been infected for about 3 weeks before
disease was discovered, vets believe.
Cattle [dairy cattle? beef, grazing cattle? - Mod.AS] at Stroude
Farm, near Egham, owned by Ernie Ward, were found to have lesions
that were 10 days old. This means they may have been carrying the
virus for 3 weeks before disease was discovered on Wed [12 Sep 2007].
It also means they probably infected cattle on neighbouring Milton
Park Farm, in animals owned by Rob Lawrence, of Hardwick Park farm.
The revelation is likely to raise questions about whether there was
sufficient testing done in Surrey before restrictions were lifted
after the August 2007 outbreaks and how disease was allowed to go
undetected for so long.
It also raises concerns that vehicles leaving the farm, which also
had 900 pigs, may have spread the disease further. Defra
investigators are in the process of tracing movements from the farm
to establish where there might be risk of further infection.
Pigs from a neighbouring farm have been culled as a precautionary
measure. But vets are said to be confident that disease has not
spread outside the Surveillance Zone in place around the Infected Premises.
It is still unclear how the virus reached Stroude Farm. A number of
theories are being investigated. These include illegal animal
movements and the possibility the virus arrived on a vehicle visiting
the farm or Egham Show, which is said to have taken place on a field
in which Mr Lawrence's cattle were grazing when infection was found.
There have also been suggestions that wild deer roaming in the
Queen's nearby Great Windsor Park may have been carrying infection.

The European commission is to send officials to investigate the
causes of the resurgence of the disease, which the National Farmers'
Union estimates is costing farmers GBP 10 million [USD 20 million] a day.
Alf-Eckbert Fussel, of the animal health unit at the European
commission, said: "Last time, it was clear it was an isolated
incident, but this is different. Now we have to be afraid about
further spread."
He warned that under a strict interpretation of the rules, the
government-funded laboratory at Pirbright in Surrey should have been
closed until it complied with EU standards.
Fussel said EU investigators would fly in tomorrow to monitor
attempts to control the disease and later to examine biosecurity at
Pirbright, where the Institute for Animal Health, a government-funded
body, and Merial, a private company, have laboratories dealing with FMD.
"All such laboratories have to comply with the security standards,
and we can see at Pirbright they have had a failure of these
standards," said Fussel. "[The institute] could be struck off annex
II [of the European directive that allows it to handle FMD]."
The virus had escaped partly because new high-tech facilities are
being built at Pirbright. "It's a parody," Fussel said. However, he
added: "Pirbright is a very important laboratory for the whole of the
world, and it has done a lot of good."
From today, farmers in England are again allowed to take livestock
to slaughter, after a relaxation of the rules by Debby Reynolds, the
chief veterinary officer.
However, restrictions in the surveillance zone continue. By yesterday
[Sat 15 Sep 2007], 1166 animals had been slaughtered since the most
recent outbreak was detected.
The latest animals, 25 pigs, were slaughtered yesterday [Sat 15 Sep
2007] afternoon after a vet identified clinical signs of FMD at a
farm close to the site of the original outbreak, [It is not clear
whether this relates to the Stroude farm or to another location;
clarification will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
FMD was confirmed in cattle belonging to Robert Lawrence at Milton
Park Farm near Egham on Wednesday [12 Sep 2007], a few days after the
government claimed that the disease had been "eradicated in the UK in
2007." A further case was confirmed on Friday [14 Sep 2007] at the
neighbouring property, Stroude Farm, owned by Ernest Ward.
Scientists say the strain of FMD is the same as the one from
Pirbright that caused the outbreak last month [August 2007], but they
are still trying to determine whether the virus has leaked from
Pirbright a 2nd time or has remained in the surrounding environment
since August 2007.
Two official reports have concluded that the outbreak of the disease
in August 2007 was caused by poor biosecurity at the Pirbright site,
which is being blamed on a lack of government funding. The live virus
was flushed from a laboratory into a dilapidated leaky drainage
system, which contaminated ground next to construction work. At the
time, tons of mud from the building work were being transported off
the site for disposal.
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) established that on 20 Jul and
25 Jul 2007, 6 lorries transported subsoil in 15-ton loads from
Pirbright to Compton, about 10 miles [16 km] south. The lorries,
whose loads were uncovered, followed a route that took them directly
past a farm where the 1st outbreak was confirmed on 3 Aug 2007. A 2nd
outbreak was detected 3 days later at another farm a mile away.
Investigators also discovered that soil, potentially contaminated
with the virus, was taken from Pirbright to Basingstoke and
Wrecclesham, near Farnham. Many other vehicles that visited the
Pirbright site could not be traced because the gate log entry was
unreadable, and some visitors to the site were not even recorded.
The HSE report also revealed: Merial, a private company producing
thousands of litres of live virus for vaccinations, failed to
sterilise effluent fully before discharging it into the drains.
Access to the site was poorly controlled. Not all people or vehicles
were logged, in particular construction workers. Security at the main
laboratory area of the institute was lax. A single door with a
digital lock allowed entry, but the code had not been changed for
years, and no one was sure how many people knew it.
A 2nd report, by Professor Brian Spratt of Imperial College London,
also concluded that leaky drains and lorries were the most likely
source of the disease being released.
FMD had been found to survive "up to 20 weeks on hay or straw, up to
6 months in slurry, up to 3 days on soil in summer and 28 days on
soil in autumn." Spratt added that "survival has been reported up to
50 days in water."
Yet just a month after the outbreaks, the government declared the
country was clear of the disease. "I am satisfied that FMD has been
eradicated from the UK in 2007," said Reynolds on 7 Sep 2007.
Spratt said the government now had to establish whether the virus had
survived for more than 30 days in the natural habitat. He told The
Sunday Times: "Declaring an area free of FMD after 30 days is an
international norm. But if it's seen that the 30-days rule did not
work in this country and perhaps internationally, they will have to
reassess that." [For the recommendations of the Spratt report, see

from FMD, see commentary at the end. - Mod.AS]

The following recommendations included in the Independent Review of
the safety of UK facilities handling foot-and-mouth disease virus
were presented to the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs and the Chief Veterinary Officer on 31 Aug 2007. The
full report (82 pages) is available at the above URL; it is
recommended reading.
The expert panel was chaired by Prof. Brian G Spratt FRS FMedSci,
Head of the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology and
Wellcome Trust Principal Research Fellow at Imperial College London.
The other members were:
- PD Dr. Christian Griot Dr. med. FVH, MPA, a veterinarian and
Director of the Institute of Virology and Immunoprophylaxis (IVI),
the Swiss National Reference Laboratory for Foreign Animal Diseases,
and a senior lecturer at the Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Bern and Zurich.
- Prof. Nigel Lightfoot MB BS FRCPath, Director of Emergency Response
and Head of the Influenza and Respiratory Viruses Programme Board at
the Health Protection Agency.
- Prof. David J. Rowlands FRSA, Emeritus Professor of Molecular
Virology in the Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology at the
University of Leeds.
- Dr. Kathrin Summermatter Dr.rer.nat., molecular biologist and
Deputy Director of the [Swiss] Institute of Virology and
Immunoprophylaxis (IVI) and Head of the biosafety department of the IVI.
RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
The recommendations are numbered as they appear in the text.
a. Immediate action on containment:
1. As a matter of urgency, Defra should require that actions are
taken to ensure the effluent drainage system at the Pirbright
facility is fully contained and its continuing integrity confirmed by
regular inspections. In the interim, we advise that work with
infectious virus should only be allowed if effluent released into the
pipes has 1st been completely inactivated (Recommendation 8). [In
practice, this prescribes that the Merial plant will not be allowed
to deal with the inactivation of live virus, thus will not be able to
manufacture new vaccine batches, unless it operates its own effluent
inactivation procedures. Until then, only assembly of batches from
previously inactivated antigen (namely from the vaccine bank) and its
bottling is to be allowed. - Mod.AS]
2. Merial should discuss with Defra how it plans to modify its
procedures to minimise the possibility of release of infectious FMDV
virus into the effluent pipe. Any new process should be validated
(Recommendation 9).
3. IAH should have a thorough review of the safety of all laboratory
activities to ensure that procedures which could release infectious
FMDV into the containment laboratories are eliminated. This is
particularly important for aerosol-producing procedures (Recommendation 5).
4. Entry to any facility handling Special Animal Pathogens Order
(SAPO) Category 4 pathogens should require all visitors to sign in,
obtain a numbered visitor pass, be escorted into the building and
handed over to their host. Visitors (including all contractors) must
be informed of the animal quarantine requirements and sign (and be
given a copy of) a form accepting that these are understood. For all
visitors, including contractors, requirements to prevent inadvertent
infection of livestock should be based on an assessment of the risk
of exposure to pathogens (Recommendation 2).
b. Further action on biosecurity and biosafety
5. The biological safety officers of IAH and Merial should institute
regular meetings to improve communication and their understanding of
the risks on the Pirbright site, particularly those that arise from
the sharing of the effluent system (Recommendation 7).
6. The responsibilities of the Site Director and Biological Safety
Officer of Merial should be clearly separated. The Biological Safety
Officer should not be subject to commercial pressures on matters of
biosafety and biosecurity (Recommendation 4).
7. Defra and the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) should work
together more closely and exchange information about inspections at
Merial. One of the 2 regulatory authorities should take
responsibility for ensuring that all aspects of biocontainment and
biosafety are thoroughly inspected (Recommendation 6).
8. IAH and Merial should erect secure fencing to separate their 2
facilities, with swipe card entrances through the fencing between
sites for those authorised to move between the facilities (Recommendation 3).
9. If identifying the source of the virus is considered a priority,
an independent group consisting of international experts in the
molecular epidemiology of FMD, and in RNA virus molecular evolution,
should convene to consider whether additional virus sequencing, or
the passage of candidate viruses through cattle, could establish with
confidence which was the cause of the outbreak (Recommendation 1).
[In article 5.3 of the report, titled "Sequencing of the viruses -
IAH or Merial as the source?" the team concluded: ... "The outbreak
was therefore caused by either the IAH-M or the MER virus. The MER
virus is the most similar to the outbreak virus, but there is
sufficient uncertainty to prevent us from assigning the outbreak to
the virus from Merial with a high degree of confidence." - Mod.AS]
c. Funding, design and governance
10. The construction of the new high containment laboratories at IAH
should go ahead as a matter of urgency. Such facilities are expensive
to construct and maintain, and Government must ensure that adequate
funds continue to be available to enable the highest standards of
biological safety for dealing with FMDV and other high risk viruses.
In the meantime, investment to ensure safety and public trust in the
existing laboratories and the effluent system is needed (Recommendation 11).
11. The plans for future development of the Pirbright site should be
reviewed to ensure that all safety critical issues have been
addressed. This should be carried out with the help of the full range
of relevant experts and regulatory bodies (Recommendation 10).
12. Biosecurity of laboratories that work with FMDV is of paramount
importance. Therefore, there should be a review of funding,
governance and risk management at IAH Pirbright to ensure an
appropriate focus on biosafety and biosecurity in the future
(Recommendation 12).
13. There should be shared governance for the management of risks to
biosecurity and biosafety involving both IAH and Merial. The 2
facilities should ensure complete clarity of responsibility and
liability for the biosafety and biosecurity of the whole site
(Recommendation 13).
d. Regulatory and inspection framework
14. There should be a review of systems for regulation, inspection
and enforcement of biosecurity for work on animal and human pathogens
at containment level 4. This should consider whether there should be
a common regulatory inspection framework overseen by an arm's length
body such as the HSE (Recommendation 14).

[The internationally recognised timetable qualifying a country to
regain its status of freedom of FMD is spelled out in article
2.2.10.8 of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code (2007). A country
where vaccination is not practised and where a stamping-out policy
and serological surveillance are applied in accordance with Appendix
3.8.7* will be able to regain its free status 3 months after the last
case has been stamped out.
*("Appendix 3.8.7. GUIDELINES FOR THE SURVEILLANCE OF FOOT AND MOUTH
DISEASE." Available at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mcode/en_chapitre_3.8.7.htm#chapitre_3.8.7>.
The Code addresses separately situations in which a limited outbreak
occurs within an FMD free country, allowing the establishment of a
"containment zone" for the purpose of minimizing the impact on the
entire country or zone. If the outbreak can indeed be defined as
limited according to the conditions spelled out in article 2.2.10.7.
of the Code, then the suspension of free status of other areas could
be lifted irrespective of the provisions of Article 2.2.0.8. (see
above), once the containment zone is clearly established, by
complying with points 1 to 5 in article 2.2.10.7. See at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mcode/en_chapitre_2.2.10.htm>.
The recovery of the FMD free status of the containment zone should
follow the provisions of Article 2.2.10.8. - Mod.AS]
