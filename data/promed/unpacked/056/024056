H5N1 avian influenza confirmed in poultry
-----------------------------------------
Tests from the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) have confirmed that the
sample from the poultry found dead on a farm near Lowestoft in Suffolk did
contain the H5N1 avian flu virus. Further tests are underway to determine
whether the strain of the virus is similar to that found in Asia. Results
are expected later today.
The State Veterinary Service are enforcing a Protection Zone of 3 km radius
and a Surveillance Zone of 10 km around the premises where movement
restrictions will be imposed and poultry must be isolated from wild birds.
The farm itself has been under restrictions since Thursday [1 Feb 2007]
evening. In addition the national general licence on bird gatherings has
been revoked, and bird shows and pigeon racing will no longer be permitted.
An urgent veterinary risk assessment is being carried out in consultation
with ornithological experts to consider the specific circumstances of this
case and determine the level of risk, if any, it may pose to poultry and
other kept birds. On the basis of this risk assessment further wider
restrictions will be imposed in the area.
Fred Landeg, the Deputy Chief Veterinary Officer said: "I urge keepers of
birds to be vigilant, to take care if handling birds which appear to be
unwell and to observe high levels of biosecurity. Owners that suspect
disease, should act quickly consult their vet. Avian influenza is a
notifiable disease and must be reported to the local Divisional Veterinary
Manager in the State Veterinary Service".
There is no reason for public health concern. Avian Influenza is a disease
of birds and whilst it can pass very rarely and with difficulty, to humans
this requires extremely close contact with infected birds, particularly faeces.
The Health Protection Agency has advised that, despite this incident, the
current level of risk to humans from H5N1 remains extremely low.
"Any possibility of exposure is taken very seriously and the Health
Protection Agency has worked closely with Defra and local NHS to ensure
that all the necessary actions are being taken to protect those people on
the farm who may have been exposed to the virus."
The European Commission has been informed of this development.

[The UK has become Europe's 3rd country infected by H5N1 during the current
winter season, preceded by reported outbreaks in Hungary (24 Jan 2007) and
Russia (Krasnodar, 29 Jan 2007). It will be interesting to obtain updated
results of EU's surveillance in wild birds; the ADNS (Animal Disease
Notification System) summary report for highly pathogenic avian influenza
in wild birds, accessible at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/adns/adns_wildbirds.pdf>,was last
updated on 30 Nov 2006. - Mod.AS]
