In response to: Drugs, fish, contaminated waterways - USA 20090331.1246
------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is certainly concerning to find fish and water sources
contaminated with pharaceutically active compounds (PhACs). While
numerous studies out of Canada, USA and Germany have identified such
compounds (lipid regulating drugs, anti-convulsants,
anti-depressants, analgesics, and estrogens) contaminating surface
waters such as rivers, lakes, and streams, as well as groundwater
sources, the concentrations are typically low (e.g., mcg/L, ng/L) and
tend to decrease depending on river flow, size of the water source
sampled, and proximity to water treatment facilities. Some of these
compounds also undergo reactions when they reach water sources that
can render them inactive (or active).

Although bioaccumulation is a concern, there is little evidence
currently available that these compounds pose any risk to human
health. There is also the concern about the potential health impact
of these compounds when they interact together in our body, even in
trace quantities. There is only a handful of studies that actually
look at the levels of these PhACs, personal care products, and
endocrine-regulating compounds that actually make it to into
municipal drinking water. Only one study that I'm aware of has
actually attempted to determine the human health impact associated
with certain compounds (ASA, clofibrate, cyclophosphamide, indomethacin)
found in water supplies (Schulman et al., 2002 [1]).

And the moderator's note is worth repeating -- there could be so much
more that we're missing just because we haven't looked for it. These
compounds exist and are accumulating in our environment, but there is
little evidence that PhACs actually make it into drinking water
sources or that they have a negative impact on human health.

[On the contrary, there are studies regarding feminization of
populations because of hormones and estrogens from pharmaceutical
agents that have reached our water sources. And there are documented
cases of this in fish as well --see ProMED 2004 archive below. - Mod.TG]
