Resurgence of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
---------------------------------------------
QUETTA: Officials stated on Mon 28 May 2001 that 2 people have died of
hemorrhagic fever and 4 more are fighting for their lives. The victims, one
of them an Afghan, were brought to the Civil Hospital in Quetta on Sat 26
May 2001 from the Loralai district, which is 300 km to the south east. Both
were vomiting blood and died within 24 hours. Hospital chief doctor Tariq
Khoso said that: "There is no doubt, they were [suffering from
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever." Dr Khoso said 4 more people from the same
area admitted to his hospital on Sun 27 May 2001 are in a serious condition.
Journalists [who visited the hospital said [that nurses, wearing masks
and gloves, were attending to the patients in an isolation ward. Blood
stains were visible on the floor and walls of the ward. "We are doing our
best within our limited resources," Dr Khoso said. The [same acute
hemorrhagic fever claimed 18 lives in Baluchistan late last year.
