Ban On Cattle Movement to Be Lifted Tomorrow
--------------------------------------------
The ban on cattle movement in Central and Southern provinces
following the outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) last year will
be lifted tomorrow.
Agriculture minister Mudima Sikatana confirmed yesterday that the
government was satisfied that the ban of the disease had now been
brought under control in the affected areas. However, Sikatana said
the movement of livestock and livestock products would be allowed
with the issuance of permits from the districts.
The ban on cattle movement was effected in September last year [2004]
following the outbreak of FMD in June.

An update, including data on the number of vaccinations, might be
