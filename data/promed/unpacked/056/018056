Since an outbreak [of hepatitis A] began last August 2017, 376 people in Michigan have contracted the sometimes fatal illness. It's mainly spread person-to-person via contact with feces.

Angela Minicuci is with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. "We haven't found one contaminated food source or exposure at this point," she says, "but we are seeing a lot of relation to people who are using opioids or drugs." People who are, or have been incarcerated, are also considered at higher risk of getting hepatitis A, as are homeless people.

A staggering 86 percent of those who've gotten hepatitis A in the state since 2016 have been hospitalized. 14 people have died. Most of the cases have been in southeast Michigan, including a recent case involving a worker at Cardemom, a popular restaurant in Ann Arbor. It's possible people who ate at Cardemom between [16 Sep and 3 Oct 2017] were exposed.

Minicuci says people with concerns should contact their doctor. "And from there your health provider can decide if you need that exposure prophylaxis, which is the treatment, or if your best bet is to get vaccinated." Hepatitis A can be prevented with a vaccine, which is now regularly administered to children.

According to the WHO, in developing countries with poor sanitary conditions and hygienic practices, most children (90 percent) have been infected with the hepatitis A virus before the age of 10 years. Those infected in childhood do not experience any noticeable symptoms. Epidemics are uncommon because older children and adults are generally immune. Symptomatic disease rates in these areas are low and outbreaks are rare. In developed countries, children often escape infection in early childhood and reach adulthood without immunity. Ironically, these improved economic and sanitary conditions may lead to an accumulation of adults who have never been infected and who have no immunity. This higher susceptibility in older age groups may lead to higher disease rates and large outbreaks can occur in these communities.

[In a ProMED posting from 7 Jul 2017 (Hepatitis A - USA (12): (MI) fatal, RFI 20170707.5158430), according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, there had been nearly 190 confirmed cases of hepatitis A in the city of Detroit, as well as Macomb, Oakland, Wayne, and St Clair counties and 10 deaths. Those cases were reported from between 1 Aug 2016 and 26 Jun 2017. That represented an increase of nearly 10-times during the same time a year before. A post from 16 Sep 2017 (Hepatitis A - USA (30): (MI) fatal 20170916.5321042), there were about 120 newly reported cases and 4 more deaths in about 7 weeks; now, about 3 weeks later,

Date / Cases / Deaths
26 Jun 2017 / 190 / 10
15 Sep 2017 / 319 / 14
6 Oct 2017 / 376 / 14

The state is now publishing weekly updates at http://www.michigan.gov/documents/mdhhs/HepA_Summ_County_SEMI2016_updated91517_601552_7.pdf, along with a detailed breakdown of the outbreak in the state over time, which is reproduced in part below, as well as an epicurve clearly showing an uptick in the cluster in August 2017:

The primary data are available at the URL above, but of the total of 376 cases,
24 were secondary cases
37.2 percent were female
86.1 percent were hospitalized
Median age: 42 years
No substance abuse + no homeless/transient living: 37.5 percent
Documented substance abuse: 48.3 percent
Homeless/transient living 12.5 percent
History of hepatitis B 3.7 percent
History of hepatitis C 27.8 percent
MSM (data include only male cases) 2.3 percent
Correctional facility inmates: 6.0 percent
Healthcare workers: 2.3 percent
Food workers: 3.7 percent
Deaths: 4 percent

The Michigan outbreak, which is genetically different from the Western USA outbreak, is less represented by homeless people. More than a 1/3 of the cases had neither homelessness nor substance abuse risk factors. As in California, MSM are not well represented but concern must be present that it could spill over into this high risk group. - Mod.LL
