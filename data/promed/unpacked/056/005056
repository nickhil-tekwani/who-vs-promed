Lassa Fever Research project, the WHO support team with a specialist

May.

WHO has provided drugs and supplies for hospitalized patients
through the District Medical Officer in Kenema and specialized
nursing support from CDC, Atlanta has been given.
Over 40 health personnel from the two districts affected attended a
workshop organized by the team which reviewed:- basic
epidemiological concepts, the need for surveillance and the

still being admitted to hospital, with a large number of deaths
still occurring.
