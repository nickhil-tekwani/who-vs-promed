Trichinellosis outbreak - La Pampa, Argentina
------------------------------------------
An outbreak of trichinellosis was detected today in a place near Santa Rosa (Capital City of La Pampa province), and for this reason, 11 animals were sacrificed in a local farm, reported provincial authorities.

Mr. Ignacio Kotani, Director for Farming & Livestock for La Pampa Government, reported to DyN (local news service) that the Bromatology Control Department ordered the elimination of affected animals in Toay, a community 10 km southwest from Santa Rosa, after determining the animals were infected.

The provincial officer revealed that "the owner of the farm complied with the required studies, verified the presence of the disease in one animal and reported the case to the local animal health authorities (SENASA, according to its Spanish initials), who, in turn, "identified where the animals were located and ordered their elimination".

Mr. Kotani said that it is 'worrisome' that of 17 pigs assessed in Toay, 11 were reported as positive for trichinellosis.

The officer declared that at the beginning of this year some other cases of trichinellosis were detected in the same rural area. He commented that "perhaps we are living in an endemic area".

Trichinellosis is an infectious disease caused by a parasitic agent that mainly affects pigs, and it may be transmitted to humans through the ingestion of contaminated, raw or poorly cooked pork.

Usual symptoms [in humans] are gastrointestinal disturbances, muscle and joint pain.

No human cases of the disease have been reported in this province.

[Trichinellosis (also called Trichinosis) is a parasitic disease of public health importance caused by the nematode _Trichinella spiralis_. Human infections are established by consumption of insufficiently cooked infected meat, usually pork or bear, although other species have been implicated. Natural infections occur in wild carnivores; trichinosis has also been found in horses, rats, beavers, opossums, walruses, whales, and meat-eating birds. Most mammals are susceptible to infection which usually remains undiagnosed. Since infection in porcines is generally subclinical, microscopic examination of a muscle biopsy sample (usually tongue or diaphragm) is used for the parasite's detection. Details on the way the above "outbreak" was established will be interesting. Can it be assumed that pigs from the affected farm have initially been found infected during meat-inspection procedures in a slaughterhouse, leading to measures undertaken on remaining animals on their farm of origin?
