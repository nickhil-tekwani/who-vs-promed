The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) has reported that 2 more horses residing at a quarantined facility in Orange County have tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1).

On [Fri 27 Apr 2018], the agency reported a new case of equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM, the neurologic form of EHV-1). "A 24-year-old mare from the quarantined barn ... displaying neurological signs has tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1. Based on clinical signs and the detection of EHV-1 virus, the horse has been classified as a case of EHM. The mare has been moved to onsite isolation stabling."

Then, on [Sun 29 Apr 2018], the agency reported that a 9-year-old mare from the quarantined barn displayed neurologic signs on disease and subsequently tested positive for EHV-1. She has been moved to an on-site isolation stable. Because the mare exhibited neurologic signs, the CDFA classified the case as EHM.

"To date, there have been 7 confirmed febrile cases of EHV-1 and 3 confirmed cases of EHM," the CDFA said.
