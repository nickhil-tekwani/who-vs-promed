As of today, Tuesday, 8 Jun 1999, lists of absolutely _clean_
poultry-producers have been established (2,546 out of a total of 3,266
firms). These producers can therefore resume as of midnight (Belgian time)
transport, slaughter and sale of their products in safe conditions. The
European Commission has announced today that member states cannot refuse
entry of products certified by the Belgian authorities to be contamination
free.
It is expected that a similar process for beef and pork producers will be
finalised by tomorrow Wednesday, June 9th.
The European Commission has no problem with these products being brought to
market.
As far as dairy products are concerned the prohibition of the sale of
butter is maintained while the sale of milk and cheese remains possible.
