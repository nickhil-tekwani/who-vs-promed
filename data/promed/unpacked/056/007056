A girl who died this month from [dengue hemorrhagic fever is the first
casualty of an outbreak in Texas that has infected 51 people, state
officials said. The state health department said Wednesday that the south
Texas girl died earlier this month, probably after she contracted the
mosquito-borne illness during a visit to Mexico.
The agency has confirmed 51 cases of dengue fever this year, the state's
largest outbreak of the disease this decade. Symptoms include high fever,
severe headaches, joint and muscle pain, nausea, vomiting and skin rash.
The disease usually lasts two weeks and is rarely fatal. There is no
vaccine or cure.
The last outbreak of dengue fever in Texas came in 1995, when 29 cases were
recorded.

Fifty-one cases of dengue have been confirmed in Texas since July 1, 1999.
Twenty-eight cases were in Webb County residents. The remaining 18 cases
were in residents of Bexar, Cameron (4), Dallas (3), Galveston, Hidalgo
(7), Nueces, Starr, Tarrant, Travis (2), and Willacy (2) Counties. One
South Texas patient died as a result of dengue infection.
The latest illness onset dates for locally acquired cases was November 11;
the latest date of onset for persons who traveled outside Texas during the
two weeks prior to onset of symptoms: December 5.
Locally acquired cases (16): Sixteen cases (eight in Webb County residents,
two each in Cameron and Dallas County residents, and one each in Hidalgo,
Nueces, Starr, and Willacy County residents) were acquired in Texas. The
Nueces County resident had traveled to Webb County, but not outside the US
during the two weeks prior to onset of illness. Both Dallas County
residents traveled to Cameron County, but not outside the US during the two
weeks prior to onset of illness.

[Henry Wilde had asked (Dengue - USA (Texas) (03): Serotype 991121114155)
what the circulating serotype is. In a message this afternoon, Julie
Rawlings told me the fatal case had been infected with dengue 3 virus. It
is interesting that this patient had no serologic evidence of previous
infection. Thus, this is not a secondary dengue case. - Mod.CHC
