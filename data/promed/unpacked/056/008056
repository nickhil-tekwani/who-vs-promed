A committee from the Ministry of Agriculture is presently studying
the cause of death of 72 deer in Gorniy Ulus district [Republic of
Sakha (Yakutiya)]. The animals died at 2 deer farms owned by the
agricultural academy and the private company "Taba."

According to veterinarians who have conducted the laboratory
investigation, the disease that lead to the deaths of 72 deer was
babesiosis or piroplasmosis.

Appropriate measures to prevent the spread have been taken. It is
known that the mode of transmission from ill to healthy animals for
babesiosis is through ticks. According to local veterinary staff,
this is the 1st case of a babesiosis outbreak among deer in this
region, although ticks are widely spread. The local ticks used to be
free from this infection, however most probably deer were infected
from deer that came from other regions of the country. [Recently]
many deer were purchased from other regions.

According to a local veterinarian the infection came with resettled
deer that infected local ticks, which then infected local deer.
According to experts hot weather also contributed to the spread of
infection. Overcrowding in deer reservations became another
contributing factor for the wide spread.

[A similar case of babesiosis took place last summer [2007] in
Karachay-Cherkessia. It was also delivered through animals from other
regions transferred to Karachay-Cherkessia. - Mod.NR

_Babesia_ spp. is probably found throughout Russia, but there are few
data. One study from Siberia (Rar VA et al: Tickborne pathogen
detection, Western Siberia, Russia. Emerg Infect Dis. 2005;
11:1708-15; abstract available at
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16318722>) found _Babesia canis
canis_ in 3.6 percent of _Dermacentor reticulatus_ ticks and the same
authors (Rar VA et al: Babesia DNA detection in canine blood and
_Dermacentor reticulatus_ ticks in southwestern Siberia, Russia.
Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis. 2005; 5: 285-7; abstract available at
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16187898>) found _Babesia canis
canis_ in 21 out of 21 samples from dogs. _Babesia microti_, which
has small rodents as reservoir has also been described (Alekseev AN
et al: Evidence of _Babesia microti_ infection in multi-infected
_Ixodes persulcatus_ ticks in Russia. Exp Appl Acarol. 2003; 29:
345-53; abstract available at <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14635819>).

In order to understand the present outbreak, typing of the _Babesia_
subspecies and identification of the local vector are needed. - Mod.EP

It would also help to know the species of the deer involved. - Mod.AS
