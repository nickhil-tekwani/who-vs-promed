In a major relief for those travelling to African [and most South American] nations, government today [19 Jul 2013] received a consignment of 60 000 yellow fever vaccine doses through WHO which will be distributed across the country.

There has been an acute shortage of the vaccine in the country, and users are finding it difficult to get the vaccine ever since the Kasauli-based Central Research Institute stopped its manufacture [in 2008].

The yellow fever vaccine is compulsory for all those travelling to African nations, after the World Health Organisation held a consultation on yellow fever saying the threat of introduction of yellow fever [virus] into Asia was very real in the age of faster air travel.

"There was a shortage of yellow fever vaccine, as WHO was not supplying it, leading to problems for users. We have procured 60 000 vaccines, and the same are being distributed to 27 vaccination centres across the country for use," Director General of Health Service Jagdish Prasad told PTI.

The Health Ministry has already placed an order of 275 000 doses of the vaccine from the WHO, which are likely to be received soon and would be sufficient for 2 years.

The yellow fever vaccine is available at 27 government vaccination centres free of cost and is also available on the open market. However, due to shortage of the vaccine, it is being sold on the black market by private retailers, leading to problems for those travelling to African nations.

[The arrival of the yellow fever (YF) vaccine will not only be a relief for travelers in India going to YF virus endemic countries in Africa and South America, it will also be a relief to public health authorities in India and Southeast Asia generally. The arrival of an individual returning home to India from a YF endemic country viremic with YF virus could initiate an ongoing urban outbreak that could quickly become a very serious public health problem in India and beyond, since the vector mosquito is present in most of India and Southeast Asia, where YF virus is absent currently. One hopes that the arrival of the vaccine and its free administration will end the illegal sale of fake YF vaccination cards as well. As soon as all travelers in India bound for YF countries receive the vaccine, the risk of introduction of YF virus will be eliminated.
