The veterinary services of the Directorate of Animal Health (DSA) have raised the alarm about the occurrence of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in the locality of El Ghrab, Constantine province.

So far, the investigations led to the slaughter of 7 cattle and the isolation of 15 others, under observation for 21 days.

Because the epidemiological status of the disease in Tunisia is deemed "very worrying" according to specialists, a vaccination campaign against FMD was launched in Constantine province about a month ago. So far, 19 000 heads of cattle of a target population of 51 000 have been vaccinated.

Despite these efforts, an FMD outbreak was detected and the whole region of Ghrab is under surveillance, according to health services. Following a call from herders, the veterinary services moved to investigate the outbreak and detected the 1st case last [Fri 1 May 2015]. They ordered the slaughter of 7 cattle and observation of 15 others. Now, agricultural services have declared the situation under control and assure they have the necessary means to prevent further spread of the disease.

The resumption of the immunization campaign aims to achieve a maximum level of protection and a satisfactory immune status of the population. The operation is to continue in the shortest possible time and must reach the maximum of the cattle population of the province, estimated at over 51 000 heads.

A workforce of 150 veterinarians, both public and private, were mobilized and empowered to perform this campaign at the expense of the state, according to the Director of Agricultural Services of the province.

[This newswire reports the detection of a new FMD outbreak in the province of Constantine. This is the 2nd province hit by the disease in eastern Algeria, after El Oued, and the 6th province where the disease has appeared or reappeared since the beginning of 2015. While the disease is recognized in cattle in the 2 eastern provinces, it is clinically exhibited in sheep in the highlands of El Bayadh as well as in Sidi Bel Abbes, Saida, Ghardaia, and perhaps Tissemsilt (see ProMED-MENA archive no 20150323.3247770).

The epidemiological status of the disease in neighboring Tunisia is deemed "very worrying" according to specialists [the source of this information would be welcome. - Mod.AB] but that country has not officially reported any further FMD outbreak since the final report sent to the OIE on 24 Nov 2014. Clarification from informed Tunisian sources would be appreciated.

The slowness with which this vaccination campaign unfolds is to be noted. Indeed, it is said that of the 51 000 head of cattle in the province, only 19 000 have been vaccinated in a month despite the deployment of a staff of 150 private and public veterinarians.

Some disparity among the provinces exists in the control approach against the disease: vaccination is either carried out solely by the public veterinarians or by both public and private veterinarians; small ruminants are vaccinated but not in all provinces; and slaughter of sick animals was performed in Constantine but not in some other affected provinces.

The resurgence of FMD in Algeria could be caused either by a reintroduction of the virus from Tunisia in case the infection had remained there, at least for the eastern provinces, or by the spread of the virus from persisting outbreaks from the 2014 epizootic through animals, especially non-vaccinated animals, and in particular sheep.

The last report on FMD in Algeria, sent to OIE on Mon 4 May 2015 seems paradoxical since it states: "there are no new outbreaks in this report." - Mod.AB

ProMED-mail's requests for information on the results of the serotyping and genotyping of the virus currently circulating in Algeria, as well as on the identity of the vaccine strains applied, are pending. - Mod.AS
