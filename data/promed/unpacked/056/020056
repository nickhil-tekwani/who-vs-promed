The number of autochthonous chikungunya cases seen in the Americas increased by 12 121 cases during the past week, rising from 759 948 to 772 069 cases, according to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).

Although the overall increase in cases appears to be slowing, some countries are experiencing heavy amounts of chikungunya [virus infections] recently.

In South America, the number of cases in Colombia doubled in the past week jumping from 6175 cases to 13 626. Other notable increases include Puerto Rico, which rose by 1500 locally acquired cases and Antigua and Barbuda nearly doubled from about 700 a week ago to about 1250 cases today [17 Oct 2014].

The dengue fever capital of the Americas, Brazil, saw an increase of about 150 chikungunya cases over the past week.

Countries with cases ex Caribbean but no ongoing transmission

Germany ex Caribbean. 3 Oct 2014. In mid-September 2014, a 42 year old male German resident returned from the Caribbean after a 2-week holiday in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. The day after his return, he developed fever, joint pain, headache, and a rash. Beside a mild leucopenia (3300 /ul), all measured values were within the normal range. Particularly platelets and liver enzymes were normal. Antibodies for chikungunya virus and dengue virus were both IgM and IgG negative, whereas chikungunya virus-PCR was positive. Another test for chikungunya antibodies carried out 20 days later was subsequently positive for IgM and IgG. He took direct flights to his destination and was not in other chikungunya-endemic areas before.
The chikungunya-PCR and serology were carried out at the Bernhard-Nocht-Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, Germany.

[3] Diagnostic tests
Date: December 2014 [published ahead of print]

ref: Prat CM, Flusin O, Panella A, et al. Evaluation of commercially available serologic diagnostic tests for chikungunya virus. Emerg Infect Dis. 2014; 20(12). doi: 10.3201/eid2012.141269

Abstract
--------
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is present or emerging in dengue virus-endemic areas. Infections caused by these viruses share some common signs/symptoms, but prognosis, patient care, and persistent symptoms differ. Thus, accurate diagnostic methods are essential for differentiating the infections. We evaluated 4 CHIKV serologic diagnostic tests, 2 of which showed poor sensitivity and specificity.
