2 deer found dead at Wind Cave National Park have tested positive for
chronic wasting disease (CWD). Lymph-node samples submitted to the
Colorado State University Diagnostic Lab in Fort Collins confirmed the
diagnoses, according to a news release from park headquarters.

Since early July 2003, the carcasses of 3 female mule deer have been found
in or near the park. The 3rd carcass was too badly decomposed to be tested.

The finding was expected and does not mean the disease is becoming more
prevalent, park officials said. But it could require reducing deer numbers
in western South Dakota.

The 2 dead deer were part of a study of 40 deer fitted with radio collars
in February 2003 to determine the rate of infection in the park, which is
located in the Black Hills. The results are a product of increased efforts
to find the disease.

"Prior to that, we were just doing surveys of animals that we might see
that were ill or sickly," said park spokesman Tom Farrell.

9 other deer have tested positive for CWD in the state since July 2002. One
elk has tested positive since the disease first struck free-ranging animals
in 2001.

State veterinarian Sam Holland said it may soon be necessary to cut deer
numbers, both inside and outside the park. Current plans by the state
Department of Game, Fish and Parks calls for killing deer once CWD
infections reach 3 percent of the animals tested. But Holland said deer are
already numerous enough to start harvesting them inside the park and
increasing the number of hunting permits.

Holland also agreed that the increase in positive tests is an expected
byproduct of increased testing.

Chronic wasting disease is a contagious, fatal brain disorder that affects
elk and deer. The disease is in the same category of brain disorders as mad
cow disease (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE). But unlike BSE, there
is no proven link between CWD and a fatal human brain disorder called
[variant]Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (vCJD).

Chronic wasting disease is not believed to be contagious to humans or
domestic animals. But Farrell said hunters should take reasonable
precautions, such as not eating any sick animals and wearing latex gloves
when handling carcasses.
