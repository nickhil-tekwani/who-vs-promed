[1] Human case
Date: Mon 13 Oct 2014
From: ProMED-mail Moderator Larry Lutwick <Larry.lutwick@med.wmich.edu> [edited]


A 52-year-old Mexico-born woman from Van Buren County in southwest Michigan was admitted to hospital with fever and altered mental status. A lumbar puncture revealed cerebrospinal fluid with a lymphocytic pleocytosis with a normal glucose and slightly elevated protein, with a negative bacterial culture and negative herpes simplex PCR. She neurologically deteriorated quickly, with imaging evidence of inflammation in the basal ganglia and brain stem.

Serum and CSF sent to the State of Michigan Health Department revealed evidence of acute infection with eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] virus.

Also, 2 other cases of presumptive viral meningoencephalitis were also seen by our group but were not diagnosed with EEE.

[2] Equine cases

On 19 Sep [2014], Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) State Veterinarian James Averill, DVM, PhD, confirmed 3 new equine cases of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE): one in a horse from Oakland County and 2 in horses from Lenawee County.

"EEE is a dreadful illness, causing severe swelling of the brain in horses, stumbling, depression, and sometimes blindness," said Averill. "Horse owners in southern Michigan counties in or near low lying forest and wetland areas should be especially aware of the risk and take extra measures to protect their animals. Vaccinating at any time against the virus is encouraged, even this late in the year."

A viral disease, EEE affects the central nervous system and is transmitted to horses by infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs of EEE include moderate to high fever, depression, lack of appetite, cranial nerve deficits (facial paralysis, tongue weakness, difficulty swallowing), behavioral changes (aggression, self-mutilation, or drowsiness), gait abnormalities, or severe central nervous system signs, such as head-pressing, circling, blindness, and seizures.

The course of EEE can be swift, with death occurring 2-3 days after onset of clinical signs despite intensive care; fatality rates reach 75-80 per cent among horses. Horses that survive might have long-lasting impairments and neurologic problems.

Mosquito management is vital in the prevention of EEE [virus transmission] and other vector-borne viruses that cause illness in humans and in horses. Additionally, minimizing mosquito populations near your horses by eliminating mosquito breeding and resting areas will reduce the chances of these insects biting and infecting horses and the people who care for them.

For example, reduce or eliminate sources of stagnant or standing water; remove muck from areas near the horses; stable horses during peak mosquito periods (i.e., dawn and dusk); use equine-approved mosquito repellants; place fans inside barns or stalls to maintain air movement; keep weeds and grass trimmed, and avoid using incandescent bulbs inside stables at night. Instead, place incandescent bulbs away from the stables to attract mosquitoes to areas away from horses.

The MDARD is working with the Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH) and Michigan State University's Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health on an active surveillance program. If horses are showing neurologic symptoms, owners are encouraged to contact their veterinarian, as there is still funding available for EEE laboratory testing.

[EEE virus occasionally produces human and equine infections in Michigan. It is interesting that these cases occurred in Michigan at the same time that EEE virus is causing human and equine cases in the northeastern USA. The 22 Sep 2014 edition of MI News 26 (http://www.minews26.com/content/?p=33962) stated that there have been 5 equine cases of EEE in Oakland, Lenawee, and Ingham Counties in Michigan. Both humans and equine animals who survive clinical encephalitis from EEE virus infection can have serious neurological sequelae. Horse owners are well advised to vaccinate their horses. No vaccines are commercially available for human use, so the only preventive measures are mosquito vector control and avoidance of mosquito bites. EEE virus transmission is likely to continue until the 1st hard frosts of the autumn [2014] season occur.
