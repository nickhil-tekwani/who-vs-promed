The 1st case of H5N8 bird flu has been detected at a poultry farm in Denmark, the country's environment and food ministry said on Mon [21 Nov 2016]. About 1-third of 30 ducks at a farm north of Copenhagen were killed by the same virus that had been found in Denmark in wild birds, it said.

A week ago, Danish authorities ordered farmers to keep flocks indoors after bird flu was found in wild birds.

Bird flu has been found in a number of countries across Europe over the last 2 weeks.

During the last case of bird flu in 2006, Denmark lost about 200 million Danish crowns (USD 28.58 million) in export revenue, the ministry said.
