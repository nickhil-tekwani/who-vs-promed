Russia: Outbreak of Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome in Primorskiy Region
-----------------------------------------------
73 cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) have been
recorded in the Primorskiy region [krai] during the 1st 9 months of
2005. This is 1.8 times higher than for the same period in 2004,
according to the territorial office of the Russian Public Health
Service (Rospotrebnadzor) in the Primorskiy region. Cases of disease
were recorded in 19 districts of the region.

The greatest number of cases has been recorded in the city of
Vladivostok (20 cases), in the Ternejskiy district (12 cases), the
Dalnegorsk district (9 cases), and the Kavalerovskiy district (8
cases). The epidemic situation for this disease is unfavorable. There
has been a marked increase in urban cases of HFRS in recent years.

Epidemiologists consider that there has been a decline in urban
rodent control, and financial support for public health initiatives
have been insufficient. Rodent control is probably the most effective
means of control of HFRS. Destruction of rodents should be carried
out on a regular basis in the spring [when the rodent population is
expanding and in autumn when rodents may seek shelter in human
habitations with the onset of colder weather. The virus responsible
for HFRS is transmitted from rodent detritus, not directly from the
animals themselves. - Mod.CP]

[Recently, an outbreak of HFRS was reported in the Khabarovsk region,
which adjoins the Promorskiy region. The Primorskiy region (krai) is
located in the far east of Russia, bordering the sea of Japan. It
borders China on the south, southwest, west and northwest. In the
north, it is adjacent to the Khabarovsk region and in the extreme
south it adjoins the Democratic Republic of Korea. The total area of
the region is 165 900 square km. The regional capital is the city of
Vladivostok. - ProMED-mail Russian correspondent]
