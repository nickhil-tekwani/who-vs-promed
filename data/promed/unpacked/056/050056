I would like to point out the option of getting vaccinated against TBE (tick borne encephalitis) when at risk of exposure to [Powassan virus] POW-V.

No matter which western European product is used, the vaccine protects (officially) against all TBE strains (i.e. Eastern, Western and Taiga strain [European, Siberian and Far-Eastern variants]) and shows about 80 per cent cross protection against OHF (Omsk Hemorrghagic fever) virus.

This indicates some likelihood that the vaccine might also confer some immunity against POW-V, and taking into account that these vaccines are safe and have minor side effects if any in terms of off-label-vaccination, the pros might be stronger than the cons.

It is not some conjunction with the pharmaceutical industry but the experience with patients severely affected by TBE that drives my thoughts.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Haditsch, who raises an interesting point about use of TBE vaccines in the USA and Canada to prevent Powassan virus [POWV] infections.

Non-use of the European TBE virus vaccines to prevent POWV infections currently is probably due to 2 factors. Unlike the approximately 5000-13 000 TBE cases that occur annually in focal areas of Europe and Asia, clinical encephalitis cases due either to POWV or its deer tick virus lineage are relatively rare. The CDC reports only approximately 60 cases in the past 10 years; however, that number has been increasing over that period (see http://www.cdc.gov/powassan/). The 2nd factor is the likely reluctance to use the vaccine off label. Should the number of POW or deer tick virus-caused encephalitis cases increase greatly and good cross-protection against POW virus be demonstrated in animal models, the European TBE virus vaccine might be considered for trials in humans to prevent POWV infections.

There are 2 types of POW virus in the United States. The 1st type, often called lineage 1 POW virus, appears to be associated with _Ixodes cookei_ or _Ixodes marxi_ ticks. The other type, lineage 2 POW virus, is sometimes called deer tick virus and is associated with _Ixodes scapularis_ ticks. Both lineages have been linked to human disease." (http://www.cdc.gov/powassan/transmission.html).

Mod.CP noted: "According to the ICTV (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses), Powassan virus (POWV) is a member of the genus _Flavivirus_. Specifically, it belongs to the mammalian group of tick-borne flaviviruses and is closely related to Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus. Human cases of POWV infections have been recognized in the United States, Canada, and Russia. In the United States, cases of POWV disease have been reported primarily from northeastern states and the Great Lakes region." (See ProMED-mail archive no. 20131226.2137895). - Mod.TY
