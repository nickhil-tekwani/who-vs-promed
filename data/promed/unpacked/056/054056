Adverse Events Associated with 17D-Derived Yellow Fever Vaccination
--- United States, 2001--2002
----------------------
In June 2001, seven cases of yellow fever vaccine--associated
viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD) (previously called multiple organ
system failure) in recipients of 17D-derived yellow fever vaccine
(YEL) were reported to the Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices (ACIP) (1--3). ACIP reviewed the cases, recommended
enhanced surveillance for adverse events, and updated the ACIP
statement on YEL (4). This report summarizes the preliminary
surveillance findings, including two new suspected cases of YEL-AVD
and four suspected cases of YEL-associated neurotropic disease
(YEL-AND) (previously called postvaccinal encephalitis). Although YEL
remains essential for travelers to areas in which yellow fever (YF)
is endemic (Figure), these findings underscore the need for continued
enhanced surveillance and timely clinical assessment of
YEL-associated disease.
The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) receives reports
of adverse events following licensed vaccine administration in the
United States (5). Enhanced surveillance for YEL adverse events was
initiated in June 2001 and includes soliciting reports from
health-care providers at certified YF-vaccination clinics and
reviewing all VAERS case reports of febrile illness associated
temporally with YEL (i.e., illness onset <30
days following receipt of YEL). During June 20, 2001--August 31,
2002, a total of 117 reports of adverse events following YEL
administration were reported compared with 104 reports during a
comparable period in 2000--2001. Of the 117 reports, six cases of
persons with severe adverse events consistent with YEL-AND or YEL-AVD
were reported. All six patients were vaccinated in the United States
with 17D-derived YEL, required hospitalization, and recovered without
sequelae. The first case was reported initially as nonserious in May
2001 but was reclassified after the enhanced surveillance system was
in place.
Case Reports
Case 1. On April 27, 2001, a man aged 25 years received YEL and
influenza and poliovirus vaccines in preparation for travel to North
Africa, Israel, Turkey, and Ecuador. One day after vaccination, he
had lymphadenopathy, headache, and malaise; 2 days later, he reported
nausea, diarrhea, diaphoresis, and fever. Nine days after
vaccination, he was hospitalized with a fulminant illness
characterized by fever of 101.6 deg F (38.7 deg C) and acute hepatic
and renal failure (Table). The next day, he had hypotension and
respiratory failure requiring resuscitation, vasopressors, dialysis,
and mechanical ventilation. No bacterial pathogens were identified
from urine, blood, or stool specimens. A toxicology screen was
negative. After 24 days of hospitalization, he recovered and was
discharged. No acute-phase serum or tissue samples for viral
isolation or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were obtained.
Convalescent-phase serum samples collected 351 days
after vaccination demonstrated a YF-neutralizing antibody titer of 1:640.
Case 2. On March 28, 2002, a man aged 70 years received YEL in
preparation for travel to Venezuela. He had fever, dyspnea, myalgia,
and malaise 5 days after vaccination; 3 days later, he was
hospitalized because of fever, thrombocytopenia, and elevated
hepatocellular enzymes, bilirubin, and creatinine (Table). He
subsequently became hypotensive and was intubated for respiratory
failure. Hyponatremia developed and dialysis was required for renal
failure. Blood and urine cultures were negative for bacteria, fungi,
and viruses. Serum collected on hospital days 21, 25, and 33 and
pleural fluid collected on day 26 were negative by real-time,
quantitative PCR (TaqManÆ) with consensus flavivirus primers and
viral culture. Serum
collected on hospital day 26 had a neutralizing antibody titer of
1:1280. After a 41-day hospitalization, he recovered and was
discharged.
Case 3. On September 17, 2001, a man aged 36 years received YEL in
preparation for travel to Brazil. He had diaphoresis, fever of 102.2
F (39.0 C), rigors, and headache 13 days after vaccination; 16 days
after
vaccination, he lost consciousness and was hospitalized with severe
headache and fever of 106.0 deg F (41.1 deg C) (Table). Examination
of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed 406 white blood cells per mm3
(WBC/mm3) (predominantly lymphocytes) and elevated protein. Blood,
urine, and CSF cultures were negative for bacteria, fungi, and
viruses. YF-specific IgM-capture ELISA (MAC-ELISA) of CSF was
strongly positive (Table). CSF
viral testing by TaqManÆ and viral culture was negative. Additional
MAC-ELISA results were negative for Eastern equine encephalitis, St.
Louis encephalitis, West Nile encephalitis, and La Crosse
encephalitis viruses.
After a 5-day hospitalization, he recovered and was discharged.
Case 4. On October 4, 2001, a man aged 71 years received YEL and
typhoid and hepatitis A vaccines in preparation for travel to
Guatemala. He had fever and malaise 6 days later; 13 days after
vaccination, he became confused, had expressive aphasia, and was
hospitalized with fever of 101.1 deg F (38.4 deg C). He had
leukocytosis but normal hepatocellular enzymes. CSF had 137 WBC/mm3
and elevated protein. CSF YF-specific IgM testing by MAC-ELISA was
positive (Table); viral testing by TaqManÆ and viral culture was
negative. CSF was negative for herpes viruses, flaviviruses, and
enteroviruses. After a 7-day hospitalization, he recovered and was
discharged.
Case 5. On February 7, 2002, a man aged 41 years received YEL and
hepatitis A vaccine in preparation for travel to Venezuela. Six days
after vaccination, he had low-grade fever, headache, and myalgia,
which worsened over several days; 16 days after vaccination, he was
hospitalized with fever of 104.0 deg F (40.0 deg C), headache, and
rigors. CSF had 63 WBC/mm3 (predominantly mononuclear) and elevated
protein. Hepatocellular enzymes were normal (Table). Bacterial and
fungal cultures of blood and CSF and CSF
cryptococcal antigen were negative. CSF enteroviral testing and
Leptospira serology were negative. CSF YF-specific IgM testing by
MAC-ELISA was strongly positive (Table); viral testing by TaqManÆ and
viral culture was negative. After 5 days, he recovered and was
discharged.
Case 6. On May 17, 2002, a boy aged 16 years received YEL in
preparation for travel to South America; 23 days after vaccination,
he had left-arm numbness, inability to speak, loss of right-side fine
motor control,
expressive aphasia, and severe dysarthria. Magnetic resonance imaging
showed diffuse, bilateral, white-matter disease; CSF examination was
normal. MAC-ELISA YF-specific IgM tests on CSF collected 26 days
after vaccination were strongly positive (Table); CSF tests by
TaqManÆ with consensus flavivirus primers and viral cell culture were
negative. Tests for Rocky Mountain spotted fever, herpes simplex,
multiple sclerosis, lupus, autoimmune diseases, and metabolic enzyme
deficiencies were negative. Reverse-transcriptase PCR with primers
for Colorado tick fever was negative; serum collected 4 months after
illness onset did not contain neutralizing antibodies for that virus.
No bacteria or fungi were cultured
from CSF. The patient was afebrile throughout his illness and was
discharged after a 3-day hospitalization.
[MMWR] Editorial Note:
This report documents two probable new cases of 17D-derived YEL-AVD
and four probable new cases of 17D-derived YEL-AND in the United
States. YEL-AND has long been recognized as a vaccine-associated
adverse event, but incidence decreased substantially with
implementation of the seed-lot standardization process in 1945. Since
then, 27 cases of YEL-AND, including seven U.S. cases, have been
reported worldwide (1,6). YEL-AVD was recently recognized; since
1996, 12 cases of YEL-AVD, including six U.S. cases, have
been reported worldwide (1--4).
This report describes the first U.S. case of YEL-AVD in a person aged
<50 years. Of the 12 cases reported worldwide, five were in persons
aged <50 years. Similar to the YEL-AVD cases reported previously,
onset of symptoms occurred 1--6 days after vaccination (1). Two of
the four persons with YEL-AND became ill 13--23 days after
vaccination.
YF is a flavivirus that causes a febrile illness in humans that can
progress to hepatic and renal failure and hemorrhage caused by
platelet and clotting abnormalities. In primates and mice, YF also
can cause
meningo-encephalitis (6). YEL is a live virus preparation containing
17D vaccine strain made by serial passage of wild type YF virus to
attenuate neurotropic and viscerotropic properties while preserving
immunogenicity (4). Sequencing evidence suggest that YEL-AVD and
YEL-AND might represent
an aberrant host response to 17D vaccine strain rather than a
reversion of vaccine virus to wild type (1,3).
The cases of neurologic disease had evidence that 17D-derived YEL was
the likely cause of illness. The four patients had onset of illness
soon after YEL was administered and had high levels of YF-specific
IgM antibody in CSF; no other causes of neurologic disease were
identified. However, viral isolation of YEL-associated virus in these
patients was either negative or not performed because of inadequate
samples. The presence of IgM antibody in CSF might be caused by serum
antibody from recent vaccination crossing an inflamed blood-brain
barrier; however, this is unlikely because of the large size of IgM.
The two patients with visceral involvement also had illness
associated temporally with YEL, had clinical features similar to
other reported cases of YEL-AVD (1--3), and had extensive diagnostic
testing, excluding other infectious and noninfectious etiologies.
However, tissue samples were not available for testing because both
patients survived despite multiple organ system failure.
Enhanced surveillance was useful in identifying additional suspect
cases of YEL-AVD and YEL-AND. These findings indicate the need for
continued enhanced surveillance, timely clinical assessment, and a
refined risk
estimate for severe adverse events following receipt of YEL. However,
enhanced VAERS surveillance efforts alone might not detect all
serious adverse events after receipt of YEL (7).
Clinicians are encouraged to report promptly to VAERS any patients
with symptoms suggestive of viscerotropic or neurotropic illness or
any patients with fever of >101.3 deg F (>38.5deg C) for >24 hours
and illness onset <30 days following receipt of YEL. VAERS report
forms are available online at http://www.vaers.org or by telephone,
800-822-7967. Completed forms can be submitted online; by fax,
877-721-0366; or by mail, P.O. Box 1100, Rockville, MD 20849-1100.
Supplemental clinical information and information about the
availability of clinical, autopsy, or residual vaccine specimens may
be requested. CDC will conduct virologic and immunohistochemical
studies of these specimens. Additional information is available from
CDC at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/yellowfever/index.htm and
http://www.cdc.gov/travel and by telephone, 970-221-6400 and
404-498-1600.
Because of the potential severity of YF infection, YF vaccination is
recommended for persons aged >9 months traveling to countries where
YF is endemic or epidemic. YF has caused recent deaths in
unvaccinated U.S. and
European travelers to endemic areas of sub-Saharan Africa and
tropical South America (8--10). To mitigate the risk for
YEL-associated disease, health-care providers should provide YEL only
to persons planning to travel to areas reporting ongoing YF activity
or with a history of endemic
transmission.
