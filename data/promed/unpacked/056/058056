Virus kills wild turkeys in southeast Montana
---------------------------------------------
State wildlife officials say 10 wild turkeys near the town of Olive in Powder River County have died of avian pox virus [infection].

Fish, Wildlife and Parks [FWP] officials say the virus is most commonly contracted from domestic poultry. It is not always fatal, but in this case the "chicken pox" type rash broke out in the mouths and throats of the birds, preventing them from eating and drinking and impairing their breathing.

Symptoms of infected birds are a rash on the legs or head, birds continually walking in circles, or sitting in a roost tree for days without leaving.

FWP State Veterinarian Jennifer Ramsey says there is no risk of infection to humans or livestock, but she does not recommend letting pets eat the carcasses of harvested turkeys.

[Avian pox is a slowly developing disease of birds caused by several different strains of avipoxvirus. A variety of birds worldwide, including upland gamebirds, songbirds, marine birds, and the parrot family can become infected.

Avian pox occurs in 2 forms, the cutaneous being the most common. The cutaneous form of pox causes warty growths on unfeathered skin, sometimes in large clusters. The size and number of growths depend on the stage and severity of infection. Birds are often emaciated due to inability to feed (see picture of the lesions at http://partnersah.vet.cornell.edu/avian-atlas/sites/agilestaging.library.cornell.edu.avian-atlas/files/avian_atlas_assets/POX-038A%20x750.jpg).

In the diphtheritic form, there are raised, yellow plaques on the mucus membranes of the mouth and throat. Transmission occurs via direct contact with infected birds, ingestion of food and water contaminated by sick birds or carcasses, or contact with contaminated surfaces such as bird feeders and perches. The virus enters through abraded skin. Insects, especially mosquitoes, act as mechanical vectors. The disease can be a significant mortality factor in some upland game bird populations during fall and winter months, in songbirds over winter, and in raptor populations. Birds can survive with supportive care, food and water, and protection from secondary infections. Warty scabs contain infectious viral material.
