Thailand has become the 1st country to detect _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_, a bacterium that causes food poisoning, in chicken blood. "There are no reports that such a case has existed anywhere else before," Opart Karnkawinpong, deputy director-general of the Disease Control Department, said yesterday, 14 Jan 2015. _V. parahaemolyticus_ is usually related to shellfish.

Opart added that in collaborating with his department, the Livestock Development Department had closed down the factory where the bacterium had been found in chicken blood. "We will conduct random checks at other factories too," he said.

In Thailand, chicken blood is included in various dishes such as khao man kai (chicken and oily, flavorful rice).

Rajaphum Khiaosanam, a veterinarian at the Nakhon Ratchasima livestock development office, said that province was the biggest base of chicken processing, which delivered both poultry and chicken blood. "More than 600 000 chickens are slaughtered and processed each day here," he said.

"We have collected chicken blood from these facilities to determine if there is any contamination. Results should be known within 3 days," Rajaphum said.

Disease Control Department director-general Sopon Mekthon advised consumers to boil chicken blood at a temperature of at least 75 degrees C for 15 minutes before consumption to avoid risks from _V. parahaemolyticus_ contamination. He also urged food shops to stick to hygienic standards strictly.

[No definitive human cases have been linked to any fowl as far as I am aware of. It is possible that the blood was contaminated with the _Vibrio_ species after harvesting. - Mod.LL
