Another report from the Director of Treehouse Wildlife Center and a local
newspaper the Belleville News Democrat have the death toll now at 27 000.
Red-wing blackbirds account for 75% while 25% are brown-headed cowbirds,
grackles, starlings and horned larks. Evidence was found of carcasses being
dragged of into the woods and some being partially buried presumably by
indigenous small mammals. The immature red-tail hawk is reported to be
making a steady recovery.
