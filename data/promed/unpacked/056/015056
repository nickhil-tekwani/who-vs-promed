As monkeypox cases increase, smallpox vaccine to be offered
-------------------------------------
Federal health officials are expected to announce today that smallpox
vaccinations will be made available to certain people who have been exposed
to prairie dogs and other animals infected with monkeypox in recent days.
Smallpox vaccine is considered the most dangerous of human immunizations,
but it can protect against monkeypox virus infection. The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention is expected to make the vaccinations
available as an option to highly selected groups like health workers who
care for patients with monkeypox, people who have been exposed to animals
sick with monkeypox, veterinarians who care for animals suspected of having
it, and scientists investigating monkeypox.

The investigation of human monkeypox cases expanded to a fourth state, New
Jersey, yesterday as the number of suspected monkeypox cases rose to 50: 23
in Indiana, 20 in Wisconsin, 6 in Illinois, and 1 in New Jersey. No one has
died. The total is more than double the 23 cases reported in 3 states when
the CDC urgently announced the outbreak over the weekend. The increase in
cases under investigation has resulted largely from widespread publicity
that led people to report rashes and illness to health officials, officials
of the Centers in Atlanta said. The monkeypox cases are the first detected
in the Americas. Most suspected cases had direct contact with prairie dogs
or while working in veterinarian offices and pet shops.

Monkeypox patients typically fall ill with signs and symptoms like fever,
headaches, dry cough, swollen lymph nodes, chills, and drenching sweats.
One to 10 days later, patients develop rashes consisting of blister-like
pimples which fill with pus, break open, and produce scabs. The rash often
erupts in different stages, or crops, as it appears on the head, trunk,
arms, and legs.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is also expected today to
announce a definition of human monkeypox, which will be critical in
determining who would be eligible for smallpox vaccinations as well as in
investigating the outbreak. United States officials stopped routine
smallpox vaccinations in 1970, about a decade before eradication of
smallpox from the world.

On Mon 9 Jun 2003, a subgroup of a national panel of immunization experts
appointed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to serve on its
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices began discussions on whether
and how the smallpox vaccine might be used. Discussions focused on the
benefits and risks of smallpox vaccine for monkeypox, a viral disease that
can be fatal in 10 percent of human cases. The death rate for smallpox was
about 30 percent.

But smallpox vaccination can also be fatal. Studies from the 1960's, when
smallpox vaccinations were routine, found that for every million people
older than 1 year who were vaccinated, 1 or 2 died, 9 suffered from brain
infection, and more than 100 developed eczema vaccinatum, a severe illness
and skin rash that can leave deep scars and can occasionally be
life-threatening.

The government owns all the smallpox vaccine in the United States. This
year, the government began offering it to health care workers to protect
against any cases that might result from an attack in which terrorists
released the virus. The only known stocks of smallpox virus are kept at the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and in Russia, both with the
approval of the World Health Organization. But the Bush administration has
warned that Iraq as well as other countries and rogue groups might have
obtained smallpox virus from the official stores in Russia and begun a
program to vaccinate health care workers before the war began against Iraq.
The number of people for whom smallpox vaccine might be offered to protect
against monkeypox would be small, the panel's chairman, Dr. John F. Modlin,
said in an interview before the panel's meeting.

[In a paper by Fine, Jezek, Grab, and Dixon (ref.1 below), an 85 percent
protective rate of smallpox vaccination in prevention of monkeypox was
estimated during outbreaks in Zaire in the period 1980-1984. In 1991, the
United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)
recommended (see ref. 3 below) its use among laboratory and health-care
workers occupationally exposed to vaccinia, recombinant vaccinia viruses,
and other orthopoxviruses that can infect humans. In the 22 Jun 2002 ACIP
recommendations for "pre-event" smallpox vaccination use (accessible at:
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5010a1.htm>)
there is mention of use among laboratory and health care workers
occupationally exposed to non-variola orthopoxviruses.

The risks and benefits must be weighed in any vaccination decision; the
observed case fatality rate of human monkeypox infection in the Dem.
Republic of the Congo is approximately 10 percent. It has been suggested
that the mortality associated with monkeypox is related to the nutritional
status of the host, and in the case of the outbreak in the DRC, may have
been associated with impaired nutritional status. So far in the USA
outbreak, there have been no deaths reported due to monkeypox infection,
with the majority of cases to date described as mild. The cited "case
fatality rate" following vaccination with the smallpox vaccine ranged from
1.1 to 1.5 per million vaccinees (from 1968 studies -- data available for
review at:
<http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/vaccine-safety/adverse-events-chart.asp>).

The pre-event smallpox vaccination program has now vaccinated over 500 000
individuals, with several deaths temporally associated with receipt of
vaccine but attributable to myocardial infarction. We await further
official information on a decision to use smallpox vaccination in this
current outbreak. A difficult decision, especially in the absence of a
large body of data with which to compare various strategic options. - Mod.MPP]

U.S. monkeypox cases rise to 48
------------------------
There are 20 confirmed or suspected cases of monkeypox in Wisconsin, 23 in
Indiana, and 5 in Illinois.

A search for the source of monkeypox -- a smallpox-like illness not seen
before in the Americas -- stretched from the Great Lakes to Texas on Tue 10
Jun 2003 as the number of suspected and confirmed cases rose to 48. "Close
contact with sick prairie dogs, Gambian rats, and other exotic animals
should be minimized immediately," warned Robert Teclaw, state
epidemiologist for Indiana, where 10 new cases were reported. "Owners of
such animals should contact a veterinarian and consult with them on the
situation."

Public health workers were trying to track down dozens of prairie dogs
possibly infected with the virus and sold as pets during the past 2 months in
Wisconsin, Indiana, and Illinois. While the monkeypox illness is not as
harmful as smallpox, officials feared the virus could jump to native wildlife
such as squirrels and become endemic, creating a new health hazard in the
hemisphere.

The Texas Department of Health said federal agricultural officials had
ordered 2 dealers in that state not to buy or sell any animals until the
health of those now in their possession had been checked out. That action
came after a Chicago-area exotic pet dealer said he bought from a Texas
breeder Gambian giant rats apparently carrying the virus that then spread
to his prairie dogs. Doug McBride, a spokesman for the department, said:
"It appears that there was a shipment of Gambian rats and maybe some other
animals from Africa to a Texas dealer. We and other agencies are involved
in tracking down those animals to see what health they are in and whether
there have been any human illnesses."

So far, no suspect animal or human cases had been found in Texas, he said.
McBride also said investigators had not been able to place the Gambian rats
at the same location with any prairie dogs in Texas, leading them to
conclude the infection spread after the animals left the state.

Prairie dogs, a member of the squirrel family, are shipped by the thousands
from the Plains states every year for use as pets. Ranchers consider them
nuisances because of the holes they dig to house their colonies. The
disease is not fatal in all cases in prairie dogs. It causes an eye
infection and nose lesions in the animals, and can be spread to humans when
they handle them.
