[1] Cholera - Zimbabwe
Date: Fri 5 Dec 2008

As of 5 Dec 2008, 13 960 cases of cholera had been reported in 9 of
Zimbabwe's 10 provinces (44 out of 59 districts), with 589 deaths (case
fatality rate (CFR) 4.2 per cent). Most cases were in Harare/Budiriro (7563
cases and 189 deaths; CFR 2.5 per cent), followed by Beitbridge (3245 cases
and 86 deaths; CFR 2.7 per cent), Mudzi (1234 cases and 57 deaths; CFR 4.6
per cent), and Chitungwiza (315 cases and 78 deaths; CFR 28.8 per cent.
Higher CFRs have been reported in a number of other areas.

Major causes for the current outbreak are: lack of clean drinking water and
sanitation, weak health services, and health staff strike, mainly by
nurses. Health staff are unable to obtain salaries from banks due to the
acute shortage of banknotes, making it too burdensome and expensive to
travel to work.

[The number of cases of cholera in Zimbabwe continues to rise dramatically,
underscoring the need for rapid intervention. Since the last posting on 3
Dec through 5 Dec 2008 (2 days), there were 1414 more cases reported, with
24 more deaths.

[2] Cholera - South Africa, Mozambique, Zambia, Botswana (all ex Zimbabwe)

South Africa
------------
Around 500 cases and 8 deaths have been reported, most of them Zimbabweans
crossing the border to seek treatment. The South African town of Musina is
just over the frontier from Beitbridge, the 2nd worst affected area in
Zimbabwe. Army medics are being sent to reinforce a treatment centre in
Musina and environmental health officers are going to towns near the frontier.

Mozambique
----------
One of Zimbabwe's worst affected districts is Mudzi, on the country's
eastern border with Mozambique. That country's health authorities are on
"maximum alert" against the spread of cholera, said Ivo Garrido, the health
minister. Specialists have been sent to the border areas, with a newspaper
reporting 169 cases of cholera in Changara district, most of them
Zimbabweans. None has died.

Zambia
------
Zimbabwe's northern neighbor has imposed health controls at all 3 of their
shared border posts. A Zimbabwean has died at a cholera centre at the
Chirundu crossing. There is a ban on importing uncertified food and anyone
entering or leaving Zambia is screened for cholera symptoms. Mwendoi
Akakandelwa, the deputy health minister, said Zambia was on high alert but
he ruled out closing the border.

Botswana
--------
At least one Zimbabwean has been treated for cholera in Botswana. Teams
have been sent to the border town of Matsiloje, where illegal immigrants
live in crowded conditions, to investigate possible infections. The
government says it has sufficient medical supplies.

[It appears, so far, that most if not all of the cholera reported in
Zimbabwe's neighbors has been acquired in Zimbabwe.
