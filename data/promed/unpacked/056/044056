TYPHOID FEVER - ALGERIA (3)
===========================
Re outbreak of typhoid fever in community of 45,000, Algeria
[promed archive.960125]:
There is a good chance that cases of hepatitis E may occur in the
wake of the fecal contamination that appears to be responsible for the
outbreak of typhoid. Outbreaks of hepatitis E have been
well-documented in Algeria in the past.

If hepatitis E virus transmission occurred during the water
contamination, disease may result; the usual presentation will be that
of typical acute hepatitis with jaundice. The incubation period is
likely to range from 25-50 days (depending on the dose).

If cases of jaundice do occur, the challenge will be to identify
the causative agent. We believe that part of an appropriate work-up
should be a test for antibody to hepatitis E virus and a test for the
virus (by PCR). One distinctive feature of hepatitis E is that the
mortality of disease during pregnancy (at least during the 2nd and 3rd
trimesters) is high (>20%); if cases of fulminant hepatitis occur
among pregnant females, the odds that the causative agent is hepatitis
E virus are very great.

Our laboratory is interested in understanding the genetic diversity
of HEV and in documenting the public health impact of the disease so
that vaccine development may continue (if warranted). Actually, Dr.
Helen van Cuycke-Gandre in our laboratory is sequencing an isolate of
HEV from Algeria obtained about 10 years ago. Examining another serum
or stool specimen containing HEV associated with a recent outbreak
would be extremely useful in characterizing the picture in north
Africa.

Therefore, if health professionals dealing on the ground with this
outbreak need laboratory assistance to characterize cases of jaundice,
or wish to discuss their epidemiological or clinical findings, please
contact us.
