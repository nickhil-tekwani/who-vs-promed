Washington County [Oregon] Public Health is investigating 6 cases of Legionnaires' disease reported within the last week in the Murrayhill area of Beaverton. Four people have been hospitalized. The county said those infected range in age from late 40s to early 80s and live within 2 miles of Murray Boulevard and Scholls Ferry Road.

Health officials have not identified the source of the infection and want to warn people in the area to look out for symptoms. Washington County Public Health is working with the Oregon Health Authority and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to collect samples and conduct tests to determine the sources of the exposure.

Legionnaires' disease is a type of pneumonia caused by _Legionella_ bacteria found naturally in the environment. Common sources of infection include hot tubs, hot water tanks, large air conditioning and plumbing systems, and fountains. People can become infected by breathing in droplets from contaminated water, according to Washington County Public Health.

[Beaverton (population 89 803 residents in 2010) is a city in Washington County, in the US state of Oregon, located 7 miles (11 km) west of the city of Portland, making up the Portland metropolitan area; it is home to the world headquarters of Nike, Inc. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaverton,_Oregon). A map showing the area within 2 miles [3.2 km] of the intersection of Murray Boulevard and Scholls Ferry Road, where the 6 cases of Legionnaires' disease reside, can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/SW+Murray+Blvd+%26+SW+Scholls+Ferry+Rd,+Beaverton,+OR.

At this point, we do not know if we are dealing with a cluster of unrelated cases or a common-source outbreak, although 6 cases occurring within one week of each other within a 2-mile [3.2 km] radius suggest they are related. The investigation usually involves genotyping the clinical isolates of the bacterium _Legionella_ isolated from patients with Legionnaires' disease to establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes of the clinical isolates match. However, if the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. We will await further findings from the investigation.

Humans acquire Legionnaires' disease after exposure to natural or human-made aquatic reservoirs, usually by means of inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella_ bacteria, but the disease can also be acquired by aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as debilitated hospitalized patients. Possible person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease has also been described by Correia et al (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356). _Legionella_ infection can be acquired less commonly by contamination of wounds.

Possible sources include aerosols generated from a _Legionella_-contaminated plumbing system by showerheads, sink faucets, cooling towers, decorative fountains, and hot tubs/spas. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 C (77-104 F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems. - Mod.ML
