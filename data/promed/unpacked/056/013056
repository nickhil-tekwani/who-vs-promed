Doubts About Effectiveness Of Control Of West Nile Virus By Spraying
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Some experts and activists are increasingly wondering whether one of the
chief weapons, insecticide spraying, has made much of a difference in
controlling the spread of the mosquito-borne virus. There have been just 13
confirmed West Nile virus-related illnesses this year in New York State [18
overall in the USA, down from 69 last year. But the virus that was first
confirmed in the United States just more than a year ago in Queens
continues to spread geographically and has now killed birds in 11
northeastern states. Spraying has stopped for the year because the cooler
weather has reduced mosquito activity.
While scientists from the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) and other agencies are tracking the virus and have
launched an all-out effort to understand how it spreads, virtually no
research is under way on the effectiveness of spraying. Insecticide
application, especially from the air, has been the most controversial
aspect of the West Nile virus control effort, spurring numerous lawsuits
and protests around the region. In fact, 14 months after local governments
throughout metropolitan New York began deploying spray trucks and
helicopters to fight West Nile virus, health officials at all levels of
government still have released only rough estimates, not specific data,
about how effective spraying has been in killing disease-carrying mosquitoes.
Up to now, the debate over spraying has mostly centered on the health risks
of products such as Anvil, Scourge and malathion. According to the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, all three pose acceptably low health risks
to people when sprayed at the very low dosages specified on the label.
Increasingly, however, critics and some researchers are suggesting it's
just as important to look at whether the sprays are an effective way of
controlling West Nile virus. That's especially important, they argue, as
evidence accumulates that the virus only rarely causes severe illness in
the people it infects, and it can be transmitted by 7 or more mosquito
species, each with different breeding, flying and biting habits.
The architects of the campaign to control West Nile virus acknowledge the
lack of scientific evidence. Getting it, they say, is a daunting challenge
that is necessarily less urgent than understanding the details of how the
potentially lethal virus is transmitted. In the absence of stronger
evidence, advocates of spraying argue that the relatively low rate of
severe human illness this year - there have been no deaths in New York
State in 2000 from West Nile virus infection [one overall in the USA, and
just 7 last year - demonstrates that insecticides, along with public
education and efforts to eliminate mosquito breeding sites, are keeping
most people safe even as the virus spreads geographically. "We've always
said there's no way we could break the transmission cycle in nature and
stop this virus from spreading without doing a lot more spraying than would
be acceptable to the public," said Dr. Stephen Ostroff, a senior CDC
official who is coordinating a nationwide effort to control the virus. "So
our perspective on the use of pesticides is that we're trying to reduce the
risk of illness to humans, and there's no question that we've succeeded.
"One could argue that the number of human cases would have been low anyway,
even without spraying. We'll never know the answer to that, and I don't
necessarily want to know, because I'm not going to recommend that local
communities put people at risk by not using all of the appropriate control
measures." Critics and supporters of insecticide spraying agree on one
thing: It's not the most efficient way to control mosquitoes.
Studies have consistently shown that, on average, less than one-tenth of 1
percent of the millions of droplets released from a helicopter or plane
during a typical spraying run actually hits a mosquito. For such reasons,
the consensus among experts is that educating the public about how to avoid
being bitten, eliminating breeding sites and killing larval mosquitoes with
less-toxic sprays before they take wing are all more efficient than trying
to kill adult mosquitoes with pesticides. But health officials in New York
City, Nassau, Suffolk and other local governments around the region said
even though they emphasized preventative measures this spring, by
midsummer, their surveillance efforts were showing that many mosquitoes and
birds around the region were infected, often in densely populated areas. At
that point, they said, spraying was the best control option left. The
debate over whether they made the right choice is especially complicated
because it's so difficult to measure or even define a successful pesticide
application.
Local health officials say they have undertaken some small-scale
experiments by trapping and counting mosquitoes before and after an area is
sprayed. Dr. James Miller, West Nile Coordinator for the New York City
Health Department estimates that in the city, mosquito counts after a
spraying are "up to 85 percent" lower than they were beforehand. And Deputy
Commissioner Carl Johnson of the state Department of Environmental
Conservation, which regulates pesticide use around the state, said local
governments have anecdotally reported "60 to 80 percent reductions" after
spraying. Some mosquito-control experts from outside the region, however,
are skeptical. "I find it hard to think that they could consistently get 85
percent control when spraying in an environment with so many trees and
houses and other obstructions," s.said Judy Hansen, a past president of the
American Mosquito Control Association. "The people in New York ought to be
very cautious about saying they're getting 85 percent control," agreed Ray
Parsons, who runs Houston's program and was a consultant to Rockland County
this year. Trap experiments in residential areas in Florida, the state with
the most extensive mosquito-control experience, generally show a reduction
of about 30 percent after a spraying, "and that's also about what we get in
Houston," Parsons said.
Figuring out whether spraying is keeping people from getting sick is even
more difficult than determining how well it's killing mosquitoes. The CDC
is in the midst of an extensive West Nile study aimed at measuring human
infection rates in portions of Staten Island, Babylon and Stamford, Conn.
But the agency isn't even attempting the daunting statistical task of
looking for a link between the infection rate in each community and the
amount of insecticides sprayed there. Several years ago, David Pimentel, a
professor of entomology at Cornell University reviewed spraying records in
Memphis, Dallas and several other southern cities to see if the number of
St. Louis encephalitis cases declined significantly after spraying.
Pimentel said he concluded that the question couldn't be answered
scientifically because there weren't enough diagnosed cases to be
statistically meaningful. Another dilemma is that one of the most
scientifically sound way of studying the problem-by comparing two nearly
identical communities with high infection rates-would require leaving one
of those communities unsprayed despite evidence that people who live there
are infected with the virus.
