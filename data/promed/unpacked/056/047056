Bernie Husbands <bernie@whidbey.net> asked [see (02) posting cited above
"There must be more to this than I understand. I was under the impression
that arsenic tolerances could be built up by repeated (and, possibly,
increased) doses of the chemical. If these were local folks
consuming contaminated well water why is it that they just didn't build up
their tolerance levels--or is there a tolerance maximum? Alternatively,
those poisoned may have been just passing through."
Thanks for the excuse for review: see pp. 1602-1605, Goodman & Gilman's
"The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics", 8th ed, 1990, Pergamon Press
for the long discussion. In short, a little arsenic intake (human average
is 300 mcg per day) is balanced by excretion. I don't know how much can be
balanced, but what bad water sources (and subtle poisoners) do is raise the
intake above the excretion limit, slow build-up occurs, and toxic effects
follow. "Tolerance" implies that the excretion mechanism would have to be
induced (made to increase its capacity) and I have no idea if this actually
occurs.

I think that the reporting of this is very appropriate. The key issue is
that mentioned in this post of people resorting to surface water more for
their source of water than groundwater. The arsenic poisoning of the
groundwater sets the stage for an outbreak of water-borne disease.
ProMED-mail reporting of this gives authorities at least a measure of
prediction of what might happen in the near future.

Although there might be elevated concentrations of arsenic in some of the
well water samples that were tested, what is the evidence that there have
been adverse effects from this? What is the evidence that "The victims of
this contaminated water develop lesions, tumors at diverse sites, and some
develop cancer"? Are these findings characteristic or arsenic poisoning?
Given the ubiquity of drinking well water, and the presumably long interval
between exposure and the development of cancer, has there been any
epidemiologic evidence to link cancer (or "tumors at diverse sites",
whatever that might be, or unexplained "lesions") with drinking water from
suspected sites?
What is the presumed source of this arsenic? Are the wells in urban areas,
exposed to industrial waster, or in rural areas? Is this a tempest in a
water pot, or is there really evidence to support this rather alarming
posting?
