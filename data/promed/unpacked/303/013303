Squirrels riddled with crusty brown tumors -- some covering 90 percent of
their body -- have turned up in 8 Florida counties in a pox outbreak that
is the worst since the 1970s.
Between 300 and 500 of the squirrels have popped up in the backyards of
residential neighborhoods, said pathologists studying the epidemic at the
University of Florida.
Transmitted by mosquitoes, the disease almost always attacks the eyes,
leaving its victims blind and unable to plunder bird feeders. The animals
eventually starve to death or die from bacteria infecting the tumors. There
is no treatment or preventive vaccine.
[Squirrel pox, or squirrel fibroma, is a viral disease which produces
multiple tumors on the skin of gray and fox squirrels. It is transmitted by
_Aedes aegypti_ and _Anopheles quadrimaculatus_ mosquitoes. The virus is not
transmissible to man. Mod. CYC
[Squirrels in central Africa are the reservoir host of monkeypox -- see
refs. above -- which, unlike squirrel pox, is transmissible to & between
humans - Mod.JW
[Fox squirrels (_Sciurus niger_) are the largest arboreal (tree) squirrels.
There are three different color phases; in the northeastern part of their
range they have grey backs with yellowish bellies, in the western part of
their range they are reddish in color, and in the south they are often black
with a white blaze on their face and a white tipped tail. In addition
several members of the species in South Carolina have white ears. Generally,
there is no difference between males and females with respect to size or
coloration. They are distinguishable from their close cousin, the grey
squirrel (_S. carolinensis_), in that grey squirrels are at least 20%
smaller and have silver tipped fur. Fox squirrels are found throughout the
eastern United States; their natural range extends from Florida, north to
Canada, and west to the Dakotas, Colorado, and Texas, but they are not found
in New England.
Eastern gray squirrels (_Sciurus carolinensis_) are medium sized tree
squirrels. Their back is grizzled dark to pale gray and may be tinted with
reddish coloration on their hips, feet and head. The tail is white to pale
gray and as is their stomach. In the north, both their ears and soles of the
feet grow heavy fur during winter. Generally, there is no difference between
males and females with respect to size or coloration. They are
distinguishable from their close cousin, the fox squirrel (_S. niger_), in
that fox squirrels are at least 20% larger and have guard hairs tipped with
tawny, brown, or orange instead of white as in grey squirrels. Eastern gray
squirrels are found throughout the eastern United States; their natural
range extends from Florida, north to Canada, and west to where the deciduous
forests meet the great plains grasslands. There are 5 subspecies of eastern
grey squirrels, _S. carolinensis carolinensis_ is the subspecies found in
most of the south from northern Florida to North Carolina, west to Missouri,
and eastern Texas.
