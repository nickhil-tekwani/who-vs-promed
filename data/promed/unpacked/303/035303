EASTERN EQUINE ENCEPHALITIS, DISTRIBUTION - USA: COMMENT

Regarding Charlie's comments "Allow me to clarify the statement (above): "
EEE has only been reported once west of the Mississippi River as an
isolated incident in Texas many years ago." Strictly speaking this is
true. That is, the disease EEE may have been detected only once west of
the Mississippi River. However, EEE virus has been isolated west of the
Mississippi River previous to this. We isolated EEE virus numerous times
in 1971 during surveillance efforts ...."
I would add that rarely do mosquitoes, and the arboviruses they transmit,
respect rivers as barriers for their dispersal and distribution. The
largest EEE epizootic in equines on record occurred in southern Louisiana,
on both sides of the Mississippi River, and in adjacent Texas during 1947
(Beadle, 1952, Mosq. News 12, 102; Oglesby, 1948, J. Am. Vet. Med. Assoc.
113, 267). An estimated 14,334 horses and mules were infected with a
fatality rate of about 83%. Subsequently, a human case of EEE was reported
from Texas in 1973. A careful review of the literature, and unpublished
reports from the Louisiana State Health Department, undoubtedly would
reveal additional examples of EEE virus activity west of the Mississippi.

[As always, Carl is correct. So were the other folks who wrote to remind
me that the Mississippi River is not a dividing line, not a barrier to
mosquitoes and viruses (including EEE virus), and not in the eastern U.S. I
knew that: (Maness, K.S.C. and C.H. Calisher. Eastern equine encephalitis
in the United States, 1971: past and prologue. Current Microbiol.
5:311-316, 1981; Calisher, C.H., D.R. Sasso, and G.E. Sather. Possible
evidence for interference with Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus
vaccination of equines by pre-existing antibody to eastern or western
equine encephalitis virus, or both. Appl. Microbiol. 26:485-488, 1973)
I think the wording of the original message from California simply was
meant to indicate that EEE virus is not found in the far west. Not many of
us consider Louisiana the far west and many of us consider Texas (certainly
east Texas) to be the southwest.
Of course, viruses do not seem to care which is where. Either they find a
suitable econiche or they do not. - Mod.CHC
