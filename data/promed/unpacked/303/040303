The 1st exhaustive study of captive elephants in southern India has
found that 15.25 per cent of them suffer from tuberculosis (TB).

Principal investigator of the 2-year-long study Jacob Cheeran said
that the study was done on 387 captive elephants in Kerala, Tamil
Nadu, Karnataka and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands; 59 of the
elephants had TB.

"The study on the health of captive elephants with special attention
on TB was conducted by the Bangalore-based NGO Asian Nature and
Conservation Foundation (ANCP)," said Cheeran, a veteran veterinarian
and elephant expert.

He said phlegm samples taken from the trunks of these elephants and
blood samples were collected and analyzed.

"In these states, there are approximately a little more than 1000
captive elephants," Cheeran said.

"The largest per cent of TB affected elephants were in temples. Of
the 63 temple elephants we studied, 16 were suffering from TB. Of the
160 privately owned elephants, 24 had TB. Of the 164 owned by forest
departments of various state governments, 19 had TB."

Cheeran said it was high time the authorities took note of this
situation and began a project to see that treatment was provided to
these elephants.

"Like human beings, elephants suffering from TB can be treated, but
then a proper road map has to be drawn out because the treatment
would be a long one. The biggest challenge is that this disease is
zoonotic in nature (it can be transmitted from man to animal and vice
versa), so authorities should act," he added.

[Elephants are known to be susceptible to infection by both
_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ and _M. bovis_. The above article does
not specify the bacteria identified in the Indian elephants. A short
review on tuberculosis in elephants, by Susan Mikota, was published
by ProMED-mail in July 2007 (see ProMED archive 20070702.2111). It
included, among other things, the following: "While most cases in the
U.S. have been due to _M. tuberculosis_, we may find more cases of
_M. bovis_ in Asia, where elephants often share grazing land with
domestic livestock." The review, to which subscribers are referred,
also covered data on the sampling and laboratory techniques
applicable in elephants.

A brief history of elephant TB and a further description of
serological tests can be found in the summary document of a 2005
elephant TB research meeting (Summary - Elephant Tuberculosis
Research Workshop May 2005, 26 pages, available at
<http://www.elephantcare.org/protodoc_files/2005/Elephant%20Tuberculosis%20Research%20Workshop%20May%2005.pdf>).
