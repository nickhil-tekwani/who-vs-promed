I just wish to pass on this information according to the Danish Press
agency Ritzau in a press release published on 17 Jan 2000, one in 3 of the
sample Danish Pet Food Snacks for Dogs, made of Smoked Pigs Ears, and
Smoked Pigs Penis, much loved by dog owners as snacks for their pets,
contains _Salmonella_ DT104 according to Flemming Bager of the Danish
Government Institute Plantedirekrotatet, which is a Danish Government
testing lab. It is suspected the national pig herd is the source of
infection. The Danish Government Advice to Dog owners is wash your hands
after feeding your dog, and do not let it [the dog lick you. I suspect
that many farmers also have dogs and feed them on the delicacies of Pigs
Ears, & Pigs Penis, so the infection cycle goes around again. In case this
information does not get out to the English speaking world I am sending you
this e-mail.
