Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) has been discovered for the 1st time in
elk hunt area 117 south of Sundance.

The Wyoming Game and Fish Department Laboratory analyzed a sample
from a targeted cow elk from hunt area 117, and the sample tested
positive for CWD. The elk was found at Solider Creek, just east of
Highway 85 about 5 miles west of the South Dakota border. Elk hunt
area 117 has been considered part of the endemic area for deer (hunt
area 6) since 2003. "This area has long been positive for deer, and
we just now found a positive elk in this area," said Hank Edwards,
wildlife disease specialist for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department.

The department recommends that hunters taking elk or deer in this
area transport only the following items: cut and wrapped meat, boned
meat, animal quarters or other pieces with no portion of the spinal
column or head attached, hides without the head, cleaned skull plates
(no meat or nervous tissue attached), antlers with no meat or other
tissue attached. The head, spine, and other nervous tissue should be
left at the site of the kill or disposed of in an approved landfill.
Rubber or latex gloves should be worn when field dressing any animal
and during butchering.

CWD has been diagnosed in some wild deer, elk, and moose in 10 states
and 2 Canadian provinces. After a review of available scientific
data, the World Health Organization in December 1999 stated, "There
is currently no evidence that CWD in cervidae (deer and elk) is
transmitted to humans." In 2004, Dr. Ermias Belay of the Center for
Disease Control said, "The lack of evidence of a link between CWD
transmission and unusual cases of CJD, (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a
human prion disease), despite several epidemiological investigations,
suggests that the risk, if any, of transmission of CWD to humans is
low." Nonetheless, to avoid risk, both organizations say parts or
products from any animal that looks sick and/or tests positive for
CWD should not be eaten.
