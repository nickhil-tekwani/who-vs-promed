Disease threatens NT wine industry
-----------------
The Northern Territory's (NT) fledgling wine industry has been set back by
the news that half of the 400 grapevines in Darwin are infected with the
exotic disease grapevine leaf rust [GLR] caused by _Phakopsora euvitis_.
The discovery was made as part of a national program aimed at eradicating
the disease from Australia.
GLR, only found in the top end of NT so far, causes defoliation and poses a
risk to the country's multi-billion dollar table grape and wine industries.
Project director Steven West says there are plans to extend the program
further south. "Katherine is currently outside of our existing quarantine
area, but it's the next nearest major centre and we're considering doing
that from the point of view of making sure that the disease hasn't moved,"
he said.

[In addition to Australia, GLR occurs in Asia, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Korea, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Myanmar, Philippines, Sri
Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, and possibly in the Russian Far East. The primary
hosts are _Vitis labrusca_ and _V. vinifera_, but other species are also
susceptible. Infection causes poor shoot growth and reduction in fruit
quantity and quality. The taxonomy of species infecting grapevine in the
Americas is not well defined and more research is required to define the
pathogen. The decision to survey for GLR at Katherine, about 250 miles
southeast of Darwin, makes sense. Disease management involves eradication
of infected vines, monitoring to determine spread and application of
fungicides.
