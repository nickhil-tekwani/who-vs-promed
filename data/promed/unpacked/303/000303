ROSS RIVER FEVER: DIAGNOSIS (4)
===============================
The previous posting noted:
>Serologic testing for Ross River virus infection is available
>from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ...

Kewl. I should just add the caveat that if the infection was picked up in
Australia, then there is a chance the disease is caused by Barmah Forest
virus instead of Ross River virus. Can CDC test for this as well?
