A new suspected case of Ebola [hemorrhagic fever] has been reported
in Busoga village in Bugiri district, eastern Uganda. The patient who
is currently admitted at Bugiri hospital is reported to have fever,
measles-like rashes, and a bleeding gum.

The director general of general health services, Dr Dennis Lwamafa,
in a statement released this evening [19 May 2011], however, said
there haven't been any new cases confirmed so far. He says the
Ministry of Health continues to monitor and observe the 25 people who
were in contact with a 12-year-old girl who died of the virus
[infection] in Luwero district.

Lwamafa adds that all district and hospital task forces should
re-activate and liaise with the National Task Force to initiate a
coordinated response to contain the outbreak. He reveals that
government and other development partners have committed funds,
equipment and human resources to respond to the outbreak.

Eastern Region), can be accessed at

HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of the country is available at

The locations of the 1st confirmed case (Luwero district in the
Central region, no. 48 in the map) and the suspected 2nd case (Bugiri
district in the Eastern region, no 8 in the map) are some distance
apart. If the 2nd case is confirmed it suggests that the outbreak is
now widespread in Uganda. - Mod.CP]
