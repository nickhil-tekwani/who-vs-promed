Jamaica imposed strict new rules on international airline passengers to
protect the Caribbean island's cattle herd from foot-and-mouth disease
inadvertently carried into the country by tourists, a Ministry of
Agriculture official said. Passengers arriving from Britain at Jamaica's 2
international airports -- Norman Manley International in Kingston and
Sangster International in the tourist mecca of Montego Bay -- must wipe
their feet on a carpet soaked in disinfectant, Dr. Cedric Lazarus, senior
veterinary scientist at the Ministry of Agriculture, said Wednesday.
More than 100 international flights arrive in Jamaica daily, including a
few directly from London, the Airports Authority said. Foot-and-mouth
disease last broke out in Jamaica in the 1920s, originating in cattle that
were imported from India to upgrade the local stock, Lazarus said. The
disease was eradicated within a year after that outbreak.

NZ closes borders to EU animal products
---------------------------------------
New Zealand quarantine officials have slapped a ban on all animal product
imports from the European Union as foot-and-mouth disease continues to
spread. However, the Agriculture Ministry stressed yesterday that the move
was temporary because of a possible trade backlash.
The ministry said it was coincidental. Ministry biosecurity spokesman Derek
Belton said the "temporary suspension" would be reassessed in 30 days.
[FMD could wipe out $10 billion of New Zealand's export earnings overnight
if it spread here. It has cost Britain tens of billions of pounds since it
was first spotted on 22 Feb 2001. The British tourist industry will lose up
to 2 billion euros (NZ$7.1 billion) alone during Easter.
Products covered by the ban included meat and dairy products, byproducts,
semen, embryos and live cloven-hoofed animals. Visitors from EU countries
would now receive the heightened attention given to passengers from other
countries where foot-and-mouth is active, he said.

U.S. Disinfects EU Luggage, Shoes to Curb Disease
--------------------------------
WASHINGTON: The U.S. government Wednesday began disinfecting some European
travelers' shoes, luggage and clothing to protect American livestock from
foot-and-mouth disease, which has devastated British herds.
Extra U.S. health inspectors, foot-sniffing dogs and close questioning of
airline passengers returning from the European countryside were among the
tools being used by the U.S. Agriculture Department to prevent the spread
of the highly contagious disease that has thrown Europe into a panic.
Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman said the United States would use "every
means" to keep foot-and-mouth at bay.
"If this were to spread to the United States ... the losses would reach
into billions of dollars quickly," said Alfonso Torres, deputy
administrator of the U.S. Agriculture Department's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service. "Not only in the economic losses, but in the trading
implications -- all our major markets would be shut down," he added.
Tuesday, the government banned some $400 million in imports of raw meat
products and live animals from the European Union after the virus jumped
from Britain into France. Canada, Australia and other nations immediately
followed suit.

The UAE has tightened restrictions on the import of live animals following
the discovery of 8 cases of foot and mouth disease. The cases were found
among imported calves, the origin of which is not known. Nor is it known if
the calves were in one or more of the 7 emirates [that make up the UAE.
The country's Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, Saeed Mohammed Al
Raqabani, told the Arabic daily newspaper Al Khaleej that the necessary
precautions to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease in the country
had been taken.
Earlier, the Sharjah-based Al Khaleej quoted the Minister as saying that he
had issued a decree banning all imports of animals and birds without prior
permission from the Ministry.
Last month, the Ministry banned all imports of British livestock as well as
dairy products following the outbreak of foot and mouth in Britain. Qasim
Sultan, Director General of the Dubai Municipality, said that Dubai is free
from foot and mouth disease.
In a statement, Qasim Sultan said that the Dubai Municipality wants to
reassure everybody that the city is free from any animal or meat affected
by the disease and that the municipality had taken stringent preventive
measures to ensure that no animal from the countries infected by the
disease pass through its ports of entry.

Gulf Arab states have launched measures to prevent the spread of
foot-and-mouth disease in the region, where Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) reported 10 cases in cows, officials said on Thursday.
Ali Arab, head of the livestock department at the UAE's Agriculture
Ministry, told Reuters 8 infected cows have been killed and a quarantine
imposed on farms where they were found. "The UAE is now free of
foot-and-mouth disease," he said, denying media reports on Thursday of more
cases. Al-Ittihad daily reported 14 cases in the oasis town of Al-Ain,
including 13 on one farm, but it was not clear if the figure includes the 8
reported by the government. Other papers reported one more case on the
eastern coast.
"Coordination was launched among the Gulf Arab states to take all measures
to ensure that the disease does not spread in the region," Arab said. All
imported livestock would be inspected and disinfected at all ports, and
imports now require prior approval, he added. The Gulf Arab states of Saudi
Arabia, the UAE, Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar import most of their meat
and livestock. They have banned imports of meat and livestock from Britain,
other European countries and some African and Arab states. Oman and Kuwait
said this week they had no foot-and-mouth cases. In Saudi Arabia, where 2
cases were reported, al-Eqtisadiah newspaper on Thursday said one more case
was found. The Saudi Commerce Ministry on Wednesday banned imports of all
meat and meat products from Iran, India and Taiwan. A senior UAE quarantine
official said tough measures already in place would eliminate any risk from
the viral disease at the $6-million Dubai World Cup horse race on 24 Mar 2001.
