From: briem@ns1.hmti.ac.by

We express our special gratitude [to Jack Woodall for his personal concern
and [for the rapid, friendly responses of our overseas colleagues through
[the Internet.
In reply to our appeal through promed-digest we received messages from the
following researchers:
Prof. Steven Tracy (Univ. of Nebraska Med. Center; <stracy@nfinity.com>,
who offered his assistance in the form of sending some reagents for the
identification of isolated viruses as well as support for post-doc training
or [for visiting scientists to conduct investigations directed at outbreak
decoding.
Prof. Tapani Hovi (Enterovirus Laboratory, Helsinki; <Tapani.Hovi@ktl.fi>,
who [invited us to forward our enterovirus isolates directly to his
laboratory for the identification.
We also got a message from Dr. David Batiggeli (Wisconsin State Laboratory
of Hygiene; <battigda@prof.slh.wisc.edu> with an inquiry about our needs.
[As of September 24, 371 cases [of enterovirus disease were reported in
the city of Gomel, which are manifested in the form of serous meningitis
and other clinical forms: herpangina, diarrhea, gastroenteritis. Children
constitute approximately 80% of all registered patients.
We have already analyzed some materials from patients (blood sera, feces,
liquor [CSF) [and from their surroundings and environment (water,
sewage). The preliminary investigations indicate viruses of Coxsackie and
ECHO groups. The virological investigations are being continued and virus
types are [being identified.

Thank you very much once again. We'll continue to keep in touch.
