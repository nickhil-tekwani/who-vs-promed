HENDRA-LIKE VIRUS? - MALAYSIA: REQUEST FOR INFO
*******************************************************************
A ProMED-mail post
<<http://www.healthnet.org/>http://www.healthnet.org/programs/promed.html>
Date: 18 March 1999
From: Charles H. Calisher <calisher@usa.healhnet.org>
Source: Rumors

It is difficult trying to do a journalist's work when one is a virologist.
When ProMED-mail receives informal messages and is asked to not report them,
all we can usually do is to sit on them until a newspaper report, a news
service
report, or an official report comes to us one way or the other.
I have heard from four different sources that at least one of the isolates
from Malaysia, from a pig that died of suspect Japanese encephalitis (JE),
has been
identified as a paramyxovirus closely related to or identical with Hendra
virus. Hendra virus has so far been reported (on three occasions) only
from Queensland, Australia. It is known to be a human and equid pathogen
but
not much more than that; there is no data with regard to porcine
pathogenicity, as far
as I know.
Whether these rumors are true remains to be seen (and reported officially).
Whether this is one isolate of Hendra-like virus among a larger group of JE
virus isolates remains to be seen. Whether the current epidemic in Malaysia
is due principally to JE virus or to a Hendra-like virus remains to be seen.
Given the age distribution of human cases as well as the occurrence of cases
in
people who had received 2-3 doses of JE vaccine, [the attribution of all
cases in the current outbreak in Malaysia to JE] has always seemed peculiar
to me.
If anyone can and is willing to send us data, denying or confirming these
rumors, we would be most appreciative. If these rumors are untrue, it would
do no harm to deny them. If they are true, it would do some harm to either
refute them or to remain silent.
Given that in the past there were personal recriminations and threats to
people who sent information to ProMED-mail without clearing that information
with the Malaysian Government, I would not be surprised to hear a great deal
of silence in response to my plea. I also would understand it. I also
would be underwhelmed.
