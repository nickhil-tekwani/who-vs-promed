Another horse has tested positive for the neurological form of equine herpesvirus-1 at a major equestrian facility in Orange County, California, bringing the number of cases on the premises to 16.

It follows the California Department of Food and Agriculture confirming 4 additional cases there on Tuesday [24 Jan 2012].

The Rancho Sierra Vista Equestrian Center, home to about 367 horses, is under a state-ordered quarantine.

The department also reported a case in Riverside County on Tuesday [24 Jan 2012], at premises described by the department as a multi-discipline equine facility. "At this time we are not aware of any links to the Orange County incident," a spokesman said.

The Riverside County gelding in question was tested after displaying poor hind limb co-ordination and urine dribbling. He lay down and had to be euthanized.

The 1st case in Orange County was confirmed by the department on 11 Jan 2012, also in a gelding. The facility in San Juan Capistrano has been under quarantine since, with no horse movements allowed on or off the property. The department said only the initial confirmed positive horse has displayed neurologic signs and he is currently recovering.

All other confirmed positive horses displayed respiratory symptoms, limb swelling and/or fever.

A confirmed positive horse became recumbent and was euthanized on 18 Jan 2012. However, the department said the necropsy results indicated it was highly unlikely that the recumbency was due to the infection.

Signs of the disease include nasal discharge, poor co-ordination, hindquarter weakness, recumbency, lethargy, urine dribbling, and diminished tail tone.

In May 2011, 10 western states were hit by a major outbreak linked to the National Cutting Horse Association Western National Championship, in Ogden, Utah.

[This disease clearly seems to be on the move in California. We certainly hope it does not reach the proportions that were reached in 2011.

Horse owners and veterinarians are certainly on the alert. If your horse is not feeling well, then do not travel with that animal. If you are planning to attend an event where EHV is in the area, you should probably re-consider if the health of your animal is important to you.
