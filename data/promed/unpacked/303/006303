Equine infectious anaemia in the United Kingdom/Northern Ireland
Information received on 1 Sep 2006 from Dr Debby Reynolds, Director
General for Animal Health and Welfare, Department for Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), London:
Report date: 1 Sep 2006.
Reason for immediate notification: first occurrence of a listed
disease or infection in a zone.
Date of start of the event: 25 Aug 2006.
An outbreak of equine infectious anaemia has been reported at
Magherafelt (Londonderry county). One case among 13 susceptible
animals in the outbreak has been confirmed.
The diagnosis has been made by the Veterinary Services Division in
Belfast using agar-gel immunodiffusion (Coggin's test).
Source of outbreak or origin of infection: legal movement of animals;
fomites (humans, vehicles, feed, etc.).

[Spread of this disease from Ireland was certainly a physical
possibility as the disease is spread by biting flies (tabanids) or
contaminated needles.
Previous occurrence in Europe was summarized by our previous posting
and I have recopied comments here:
Equine infectious anemia (EIA) was first reported in the U.K. in
1976. It is probably easier to list the European countries that have
never reported EIA previously (according to OIE): Belgium, Czech
Republic, Kosovo, Liechtenstein, Malta, Netherlands, Slovakia and
Switzerland. All these countries should consider themselves lucky
and congratulate themselves on the success of their disease control
tactics, as EIA is not a trivial disease for the horse population.
USDA-APHIS fact sheet information on EIA is copied below - for more
information see
<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/lpa/pubs/fsheet_faq_notice/fs_aheia.html>:
Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is an infectious and potentially fatal
viral disease of members of the horse family. The equine infectious
anemia virus (EIAV) is categorized as a lentivirus: it contains
genetic RNA material, which it uses to produce DNA. This DNA is then
incorporated into the genetic makeup of infected cells. Identified in
France in 1843 and first tentatively diagnosed in the United States
in 1888, EIA has commanded a great deal of attention over the years.
No vaccine or treatment exists for the disease. It is often difficult
to differentiate from other fever-producing diseases, including
anthrax, influenza, and equine encephalitis.
EIA is significant historically because it is the first disease of
horses proven to be caused by a "filterable virus" -- one that can
survive a special laboratory filtering procedure and remain
infectious. EIAV is the first lentivirus-induced disease proven to be
transmitted by insects. And EIA is the first persistent virus for
which antigenic drift was defined. (Antigenic drift is the virus'
ability to change its form sufficiently so that it is no longer
vulnerable to existing antibodies.) Finally, EIA is the first
lentivirus-induced disease for which a diagnostic test was approved.
