We hear from a reliable source that there is an outbreak in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo with hundreds of cases and a few deaths of what is
suspected to be plague. Plague is endemic there. ProMED-mail would
appreciate confirmation.
Note that the Congo lies across the border to the west of Uganda, an area
where there is currently a plague outbreak (see ref. above).
