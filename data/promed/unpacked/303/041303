Three people have died and an additional 51 hospitalized in eastern
Indonesia from a disease transmitted by dog bites.
According to health officials, it does not appear to be rabies, because of
the time between bite and death. T. S. Salean, of the Nusaa Tangara
provincial husbandry, said the current victims have survived for more than
one month after the bite, as opposed to survival for approximately one week
in rabies cases.
Salean also said that the disease appeared in November of last year (1997)
coincidentally with a bacterial infection affecting swine. More than 2,000
pigs were destroyed in that outbreak.
An inquiry is underway by the Health Ministry and the Animal Husbandry
Directorate General. An order has been issued by authorities in Nusa
Tangara province calling for the capture and destruction of all stray dogs.
