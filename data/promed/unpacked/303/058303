Two positive cases of the Polio have been registered in the southern province of Kandahar, provincial health officials said [Tue 30 Jan 2018], as the ministry of public health with the cooperation of the United Nations' World Health Organization started the new round of vaccination.

The cases were registered in the districts of Spin Boldak and Shah Wali Kot, according to the officials. 'A 2-year old boy and a 2 and 1/2-year old girl are affected by the Polio disease,' said Abdul Shakoor Nosrat, head of the provincial health department.

He added that with the 2 new cases, the number of children affected by Polio soars up to 9 in these districts with 6 in Shah Wali Kot and 3 in Spin Boldak.

Afghanistan is 1 of 3 countries in the world (Pakistan and Nigeria are the other countries) where Polio is still affecting children under the age of 5.

Afghan authorities have promised to eradicate Polio from the country within 5 years.

[In last week's GPEI (Global Polio Eradication Initiative), there was a report of a case in Kama district, Nangarhar province with date of onset of the illness on 1 Jan 2018 making it the 1st confirmed case reported worldwide for 2018. In addition, there was a report of a positive environmental sample (for WPV1) from Kandahar district, Kandahar province on 27 Dec 2017 (see Poliomyelitis update (04): global (Afghanistan, Pakistan), Nigeria rumors 20180125.5584166).

If one looks at a map of Kandahar province and its districts, one sees that Shah Wali Kot is contiguous with Kandahar district to its north, while Spin Boldak is to the southeast of Kandahar district, separated by Daman district. Of note is that the Wesh-chaman border crossing from Afghanistan and Pakistan is located in Wesh, Spin Doldak and goes into Chaman Balochistan, which is located in the Qilla Abdullah District of Pakistan where there have been cases of polio confirmed and positive environmental samples during 2017 (see https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Kandahar_districts.png).

The numbers of cases of polio in the 2 involved districts of Kanadar cited in the above article are numbers consistent with reported cases during 2017. The above article does not give dates of onset of illness of these 2 newly reported cases to know if these are "delayed" reports of 2017 cases or new 2018 cases. Hopefully tomorrow's weekly update from the GPEI will help clarify this, but should knowledgeable sources in the region have some answers to this question, we'd be very appreciative to receive them.
