We report 2 cases of falciparum malaria from Punta Cana in the
Dominican Republic. A couple, both aged 71 years, traveled from
Germany to Punta Cana from 27 Oct to 10 Nov 2007. Remarkably, neither
of them left Punta Cana to travel the country.

No malaria prophylaxis was taken, in accordance with current
recommendations in Germany. However, repellents were used. After
return to Germany, both developed diarrhea, chills and subsequent
fever. On 25 Nov 2007, the patients were admitted to the Staedtisches
Krankenhaus in Kiel, Germany. The working diagnosis of malaria was
confirmed at the Bernhard-Nocht-Institute for Tropical Medicine in
Hamburg, Germany. Parasite density was < one percent, species
_Plasmodium falciparum_ in both patients. Because of pre-existing
renal insufficiency, we advised treatment with Mefloquine. The
patients are currently in stable clinical condition but still
hospitalized. Alertness and further surveillance is warranted.

[These are the 1st new malaria cases in tourists reported by ProMED
since December 2006, and they demonstrate that there still is a risk
in tourist areas. The WHO and CDC advise chemoprophylaxis with
chloroquine in the provinces bordering Haiti and in all areas of La
Altagracia Province, including resort areas. This recommendation is
still relevant. - Mod.EP]
