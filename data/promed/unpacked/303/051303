As part of a series of initiatives to closely monitor the development of the Schmallenberg virus (SBV), the Commission has today earmarked almost EUR 3 million [about USD 3.9 million] to support 7 Member States to carry out scientific studies aiming to gather further information on the SBV. 14 projects submitted by 7 Member States have been selected based on commonly agreed priorities aiming to fill the SBV knowledge gap in 3 main areas: the mechanism by which the infection is caused (pathogenesis); the transmission pathways, the role of vectors and reservoirs, and the host range (epidemiology), as well as the development of suitable analytical methods allowing large-scale testing. Most (11 out of 14) of the scientific studies have been presented by several Member States in the form of a consortium aiming for synergies and cooperation and allowing a wider range of data for example on vectors distribution, weather conditions, and host ranges. The studies will be co-financed by the Commission at the rate of 50 percent of eligible costs for the period 1 Apr 2012 to 31 Dec 2013 for the following Member States: Belgium; Germany; Spain; France; Italy; the Netherlands; and the UK. The studies are expected to be finalised by 31 Dec 2013 and published in April 2014.

SBV is an emerging infectious agent of ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats, and wild ruminants) named after the place where it was first isolated in the EU in November 2011. Available information indicates that the SBV does not infect humans and the number of affected animals (mainly congenital malformations and aborts) is very limited compared with the susceptible ruminant population in the 8 Member States (Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, Luxemburg, The Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom) that have signalled confirmed cases of SBV.

A 3rd case of the Schmallenberg virus [SBV] has been found in a flock of sheep at a Jersey farm. The virus, which is thought to spread through midges, causes deformed or stillborn livestock.

SBV first appeared in Jersey in March [2012] when 5 lambs were born dead and badly deformed. The States Vet Linda Lowseck said she was waiting for more test results, but she said dairy farmers needed to be cautious. She said: "There is a concern for farmers because they may have cows which appear perfectly normal now but they are carrying deformed calves which will develop to full size but the cow will not be able to give birth on her own. So farmers know they need to be ready to step in to assist or call their vet and they may in the most extreme situation need a caesarean section."

There have been dozens of reports of the SBV across England and cases have been reported in Normandy, France.

[According to the AHLVA (UK Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency) reports, the 3rd case in sheep in Jersey had been detected between 26 and 30 Apr 2012. Its publication at present may be explained by the need to maintain the alertness of cattle breeders; so far, no case of SBV has been recorded in cattle in the Channel Islands. A case in sheep at the end of April may indicate the virus activity during January or even later, beyond the timeframe known so far.

AHLVA's update of 8 May 2012 included the following commentary:
"There are 256 UK farms reporting SBV: 36 in cattle and 220 in sheep. There are no new reported cases since 4 May 2012. All farms are within the recognised risk counties in England.

"The decline in the numbers of reporting farms is in line with all EU Member States, where the sheep reports have declined as lambing in 'at risk' sheep (those at a critical time of gestation when infection can impact on the foetus) draws to an end. This is also in line with Defra's own predictions considering UK farming practices and estimated time of infection occurring in the UK. We continue to expect to see cases in cattle into early summer." - Mod.AS]

[The island of Jersey, officially the Bailiwick of Jersey, is the largest of the Channel Islands. It is a British Crown Dependency but not part of the United Kingdom or the European Union, although it is treated as part of the European Community for the purposes of free trade in goods (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey).
