Mosquitoborne viruses [are] on the rise in South Australia. Health
authorities in South Australia say a rise in mosquitoborne diseases has
prompted a warning to residents and holidaymakers in the state's Riverland
area to protect themselves from being bitten.

The Advertiser reports that 70 people have been infected with the Ross
River and Barmah Forest viruses in December [2010], well up on the 28 cases
reported a year ago. SA Health says it'll be carrying out mosquito control
measures in public areas.

[Although there is no current flood warning for the Riverland area along
the Murray River in eastern South Australia state, the rains in the area
are predicted to continue today (13 Jan 2011), which are likely to create
additional breeding sites for mosquitoes that are vectors of Ross River and
Barmah Forest viruses. Occurrence of additional cases of infection by these
viruses would not be surprising.
