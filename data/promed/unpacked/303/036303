Canada: Hantavirus Infection Responsible for Death of Farmer in Saskatchewan
---------------------------------------------------
A Storthoaks-area farmer has died from hantavirus infection, the Sun
Country Regional Health Authority has confirmed. It is believed the
39-year-old farmer, who died on 26 Mar 2003 in Regina, came in contact with
the disease while chopping bales on his farm. Dr. David Butler-Jones,
medical health officer with the health authority, has confirmed hantavirus
as the cause of death and said health officials will hold an education
meeting in Redvers on Monday with farmers to discuss the disease.
Hantavirus infection is carried by the deer mouse and begins as a flu-like
illness. The initial symptoms include fever, muscle aches, cough,
headaches, nausea, and vomiting. As the disease gets worse, symptoms of
pneumonia may develop and heart function may be affected. The initial
symptoms may appear from one to 6 weeks after the exposure to hantavirus.
Once the symptoms appear, the disease can progress very rapidly and become
life-threatening in a very short time.
Since 1994, 8 people in Saskatchewan have been diagnosed with hantavirus
infections. In Canada, 41 cases have been reported with 16 deaths. One
quarter of the cases involved exposure on farms.
A person may be exposed to hantavirus by inhaling dust after disturbing
nests or breathing in closed spaces inhabited by infected mice. The deer
mouse is the main carrier of hantavirus, but other wild rodents can cause
problems as well. Deer mice spread the virus in their urine, saliva,
droppings, and nesting materials. Deer mice live in all parts of the
Prairies, but are mainly found in rural areas. Butler-Jones said any time
people are working in enclosed spaces, cleaning out feed bins or barns,
they should be wearing a mask and gloves. Bleach water should be used when
disinfecting. "It is one of those diseases that we will see from time to
time. The rural municipalities have detailed information on what kind of
masks are available," Butler-Jones said. Derrick Mooney, health inspector
with Sun Country Regional Health Authority, said people need to be exposed
to a fairly large concentration of the virus in order to contract it.
