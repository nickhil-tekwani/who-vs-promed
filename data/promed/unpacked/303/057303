An outbreak of equine influenza [EI] has been confirmed in the locality of Colina, Santiago Metropolitan Region. SAG [Agriculture and Livestock Service] recommends that [horse owners] be on alert for signs compatible with the disease and notify the nearest office.

SAG regional director for Magallanes Region, Gerardo Otzen Martinic, reported that the disease was detected on a premise in the commune of Colina in the Santiago Metropolitan Region. To date 2 animals have tested positive in an area of small cattle and horse holdings.

This disease is described as highly contagious, capable of causing explosive outbreaks, and characterized by fever, cough, and nasal discharge; it is self-limiting and the majority of horses recover completely, but recovery can take from weeks to months without appropriate treatment. It does not affect humans or other productive animals.

The commonest source of infection is the introduction of a new animal into the premises; therefore the 1st measure should be the isolation of infected animals. As there are no specific antiviral drugs against EI, it is only possible to apply support measures to keep the animals in the best condition possible while infected and to establish a vaccination and revaccination plan for healthy animals to achieve high levels of immunity; it is important that affected horses do not work or exercise.

Otzen noted that equine influenza is an OIE mandatory notifiable disease. In Chile it occurs sporadically and at times has assumed an epizootic character. The last outbreak dates back to 2006 and affected 5 regions in the country. Since outbreaks of EI have been reported in the Magallanes Region in previous years and there is a vaccine that confers excellent immunity, SAG requires the vaccination of all horses being brought into the region.

[Equine influenza, caused by the orthomyxovirus equine influenza A type 2 (A/equine 2), is one of the commonest infectious diseases of the respiratory tract of horses. It is endemic in the equine population of the United States and throughout much of the world, with the notable exceptions of New Zealand and Iceland. Equine influenza virus does not constantly circulate, even in large groups of horses, but is sporadically introduced by an infected horse. This epidemiologic finding and the rapid elimination of the virus by the equine immune response suggest that infection can be avoided by preventing entry of the virus into an equine population (that is, by the quarantine of newly arriving horses for at least 14 days) and by appropriate vaccination before exposure. All horses should be vaccinated against equine influenza unless they live in a closed and isolated facility.

To date, the most important factors associated with increased risk of infection have been identified as:
1. Age: horses 1 to 5 years old are more susceptible. Older horses are generally less susceptible to infection, but immunity can be overwhelmed in horses frequently exposed at shows or similar athletic events.
2. Serum concentrations of influenza virus-specific antibody: the importance of local mucosal protection is difficult to quantitate by methods currently available.
3. Frequent contact with large numbers of horses.

Equine influenza is highly contagious and the virus spreads rapidly through groups of horses in aerosolized droplets dispersed by coughing. The severity of clinical signs depends on the degree of existing immunity, among other factors. Horses that are partially immune can become subclinically infected and shed virus. Immunity to the same (homologous) strain of virus following natural infection persists for about one year. Immunity following vaccination with inactivated influenza vaccines can be short-lived, allowing recently vaccinated horses to become infected and shed virus, thereby contributing to maintenance and spread of infection within the equine population. For these reasons, only vaccines of proven efficacy should be selected for use.

Although influenza is endemic in many countries and circulates continuously in the equine population, explosive outbreaks occur at intervals of several years when the immunity of the equine population wanes, and sufficient antigenic drift in the virus has occurred, allowing the virus to evade vaccinal immunity. Antigenic drift, by generating antigenically heterologous viruses, reduces the degree and duration of protection conferred by previous infection or vaccination. Although antigenic drift of equine influenza virus is slower than that of human influenza virus, it is still recommended that equine vaccines contain killed viral antigens from isolates obtained within the most recent 5 years, and ideally, representatives of both the American and Eurasian lineages should be included. Alternatively, vaccines containing single strains of virus should have proven efficacy against both American and European lineage viruses.

Historically, equine influenza vaccines have been administered at intervals as short as every 3 months to horses considered at high risk of infection. All currently marketed equine influenza vaccines are likely to provide protection of at least 6 months duration. This is true for both of the modified live vaccines on the market today, and for inactivated vaccines. This performance depends on the quality of currently marketed vaccines, and maintaining this performance will depend on the inclusion of any new antigenically distinct equine influenza viruses that may appear in the horse population in the future.

There are 3 types of vaccines: inactivated, canary pox vectored, and a modified- live vaccine. Check with your veterinarian for which type is available in your area.

If the situation in Chile is truly an outbreak situation, then vaccination may be a means of control. Vaccination to boost immunity in the face of an outbreak may be a valuable strategy if the outbreak is detected early enough. In previously vaccinated horses, any vaccine can be used for this purpose. In unvaccinated horses or horses with an unknown vaccination history, the early onset of immunity after administration of the intranasal product (protection within 7 days), may recommend it for use.
