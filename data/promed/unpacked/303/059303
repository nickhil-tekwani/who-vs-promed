First Report of Bean pod mottle virus in Soybean in Canada

AAFC, 2585 County Road 20, Harrow, ON N0R 1G0 Canada; and A. U.

College, P.O. Box 400, Ridgetown, ON N0P 2C0 Canada. Plant Dis.

for publication 4 Jan 2002.
In 2001, soybean fields were surveyed to determine the incidence of
viruses because soybean aphids (_Aphis glycines_ Matsamura), known to
transmit Soybean mosaic [poty]virus (SMV) (2), were found in Ontario.
In addition, bean leaf beetle[s] (_Cerotoma trifurcata_ Forster)
[were] found during 2000 to be contaminated with Bean pod mottle
[como]virus (BPMV), although soybean plants, on which the beetles
were feeding, tested negative (3).
In the current survey, young soybean leaves were selected at random
in July and August from 20 plants per site at growth stages R4 to R5
(1) from 415 sites representing the entire soybean-producing area in
Ontario. Samples were maintained under cool conditions until received
at the laboratory, where they were promptly processed. A combined
sub-sample was obtained from the 20 plants per site.
415 sub-samples were tested for SMV, BPMV, Tobacco ringspot virus
(TRSV), and Tobacco streak virus (TSV) using polyclonal antibody kits
for ... DAS-ELISA (Agdia Inc., Elkart, IN). ELISA plates were read
with a plate read er (MRX, Dynex Technologies Inc., Chantilly, VA),
and results were analyzed using ELISA software (Leading Edge
Research, Merrickville, Ontario) and compared positive and negative
controls (Agdia).
TRSV was detected in one sample from Essex County and another sample
from Middlesex County. SMV, BPMV, [but] TSV were not found in
commercial soybean fields. However, SMV and BPMV were found in
samples originating from two soybean breeding nurseries, one in Essex
County and one in Kent County.
[DAS-ELISA of] seedlings of soybean cv. Williams 82, inoculated in
the greenhouse with sap from leaf samples that tested positive for
BPMV, [were confirmed positive for BPMV]. SMV and TRSV have been
found previously in commercial soybean fields in Ontario (4).
To our knowledge, this is the first report of BPMV on soybean plants in Canada.

[BPMV was first reported in _Phaseolus vulgaris_ cv. Tendergreen;
from Charleston, U.S.A; by Zaumeyer and Thomas (1948). The virus is
transmitted by beetles (_Ceratoma trifurcata_, _Diabrotica balteata_,
_D. undecimpunctata howardii_, _Colaspis flavida_, _C. lata_,
_Epicauta vittata_, _Epilachna varivestis_ ; Coleoptera). It is also
transmitted by mechanical inoculation and by grafting but is not
transmitted by seed or pollen. BPMV was first observed on soybean in
Arkansas, North Carolina, and Virginia in 1958 and has since spread
to soybean-growing areas in eastern, midwestern, and southern states.
Crop losses of 50 percent have been reported in some states. - Mod.DH]
