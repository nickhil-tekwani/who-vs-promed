Egypt: Bird flu confirmed in Egypt trio
-------------------------------------------
Three members of an Egyptian family have tested positive for the
virulent H5N1 strain of the bird flu virus. A 30-year-old woman was
1st treated on Sun 17 Dec 2006 before a brother and sister, aged 26
and 15, fell ill. [It is presumed that the 2 sibling cases are those
described in a preceding post: "Avian influenza, human (187): Egypt
20061224.3599, and that the 30-year-old woman is the fatal case
described in part [2] below].
The World Health Organization confirmed the test results on the 3,
who live with 30 other family members raising poultry in a town north
of Cairo. The positive tests raise to 18 the total number of human
cases in Egypt. Seven of those people have died.
The family live together in one house in the town of Zifta in
Gharbiya province, about 80 km (50 miles) north of Cairo. A WHO
official said the family raised ducks and the brother and sister had
become infected after slaughtering the flock in an effort to stem the
spread of the H5N1 virus.
The 30-year-old woman, who also developed symptoms, is recovering
well in a Cairo hospital, said Hassan el-Bushra, a WHO regional
adviser. Three of the family's ducks had died of the virus, he added.
Egypt is a major route for migratory birds and is one of the
countries worst hit by the virus outside Asia. Government officials
had hoped an initial outbreak of H5N1 among poultry in February 2006
had been contained and would not further affect the country's food
supply. In the Middle East, the disease is also known to be present
in Iran, Iraq, Israel, Gaza and the West Bank.

8th Egyptian Dies of Avian influenza
-------------------------------------------
An Egyptian woman died of bird flu on Sun 24 Dec 2006, only hours
after tests confirmed she had been suffering from the highly
pathogenic H5N1 virus (see part [1] above), a World Health
Organization official said. Hassan el-Bushra, regional adviser for
communicable diseases surveillance at the WHO, said the 30-year-old
woman had been in hospital since mid-December 2006, but doctors had
not immediately suspected bird flu, as she denied having had contact
with poultry.
Her death brings the number of total human deaths from H5N1 in Egypt to 8.
