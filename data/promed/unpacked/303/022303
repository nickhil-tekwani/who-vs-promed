[This report provides no information about the etiology of the cases, nor does it indicate if any samples were submitted for laboratory testing. Acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in previous reports from northeastern India attribute all or a minority of the cases to Japanese encephalitis virus infections. Others reports have associated the cases with polluted water, suggesting enterovirus infections.
