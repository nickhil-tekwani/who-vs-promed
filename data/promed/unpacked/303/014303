New SARS-like virus can 'jump directly from bats to humans without mutating, sparking fears of a future epidemic'.

Scientists have discovered a new virus, similar to SARS, that can jump from bats to humans, prompting fears of a future epidemic.

They warn there is no treatment for the virus, referred to as SHC014-CoV, which can cross the species divide without the need to mutate.

But, they caution, it is still not clear whether or not the disease has the ability to spread from human to human.

Senior study author, Dr Ralph Baric, at the University of North Carolina, said: 'Studies have predicted the existence of nearly 5000 coronaviruses in bat populations and some of these have the potential to emerge as human pathogens. So this is not a situation of 'if' there will be an outbreak of one of these coronaviruses, but rather when and how prepared we'll be to address it.'

Researchers said their discovery is notable, as it highlights an ongoing debate over the US government's decision to suspend all gain of function experiments on a variety of select agents, earlier this year [2015].

The move has put a substantial standstill on the development of vaccines or treatments for these pathogens should there be an outbreak.

SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, first jumped from animals to humans in 2002 to 2003, triggering a worldwide outbreak with around 8000 cases being diagnosed, including one at the university's Chapel Hill location. Almost 800 people lost their lives during the outbreak.

SARS-CoV presents much like flu symptoms, but can accelerate, compromising a person's breathing and lead to a deadly form of pneumonia.

The outbreak was controlled through public health interventions, and the original virus was thought to have been extinct since 2004.

Dr Baric and his team demonstrated that the newly-identified SARS-like virus, labelled SHC014-CoV, can jump from its host, Chinese horseshoe bats.

The virus latches on to the same receptor in the body as the SARS virus, allowing it to be transmitted across to humans.

In addition, the team discovered the new virus also replicates as well as SARS-CoV in primary human lung cells, the preferred target for infection.

Dr Baric, who works at the university's Gillings School of Global Public Health and is an expert in coronaviruses, added: 'This virus is highly pathogenic and treatments developed against the original SARS virus in 2002 and the ZMapp drugs used to fight Ebola fail to neutralise and control this particular virus.

'So building resources, rather than limiting them, to both examine animal populations for new threats and develop therapeutics, is key for limiting future outbreaks.'

The findings are published in the journal Nature Medicine.

[The finding is presented in the last issue of Nature Medicine http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nm.3985.html.

Using metagenomic data showed that chimeric SHC014 viruses replicate in human airway cultures, cause pathogenesis in vivo, and escape current therapeutics. This work suggests a potential risk of a SARS-like pandemic that warrants preparedness efforts.

Horseshoe bats (_Rhinolophus_ spp) were the source of SARS-CoV's, as is also the case for SHC014-CoV. All species are insectivorous, capturing insects in flight. - Mod.PMB
