Alberta: Suspected Norwalk-like Virus Outbreak in Calgary Hospital
--------------------------------------------------
A viral infection has forced health officials to send home staff and to
enact isolation measures on 2 units of the Rockyview Hospital. So far, 38
people have fallen ill since the symptoms first appeared in the hospital's
cardiac and geriatric units last weekend. "It appears to be a Norwalk
virus," said Calgary Health Region spokesman Doug Fraser. Of those fallen
ill, 18 of are patients and 20 are staff members. Norwalk causes up to 48
hours of diarrhea, vomiting, fever, chills, headaches, and abdominal pain.
