The company behind rawhide dog chew products has issued a recall for multiple brands of its products over concerns of potential chemical contamination. The move comes after United Pet Group said it received reports of pet illnesses involving diarrhea and vomiting, Fox 13 reported.

The Illinois-based company, which uses manufacturing facilities in Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil, said it has identified the source of contamination but is issuing a nationwide recall for products including American Beefhide, Digest-eeze, Healthy Hide, Petco or "Good Lovin" Hill Country Fare, Priority Pet, Exer-Hides, Essential Everyday, Enzadent or Dentalhex, Dentley's, and Companion.

In a press release, the company said the facilities were using a quaternary ammonium compound mixture as a processing aid, which is not approved in the US. Exposure to the compound could cause pets to experience reduced appetite and gastric irritation, Fox 13 reported.

The affected products have an expiration date ranging from 6/01/2019 through 5/31/2020. Consumers are urged to dispose of the product or return it for a full refund.

[These are rawhide chews. They should be used as a treat, not as a meal or a meal replacement for the pet. Sadly, I have seen dogs so excited to get a rawhide treat that they will chew a little and gulp a lot, without completely chewing the product. This has been known to produce vomiting. Any gastric irritation from possibly hard material or even sharp points on the material can produce either vomiting or diarrhea, or both.

The press release is not specific on the quaternary ammonia, which is a broad category of numerous chemicals. Without knowing which chemicals or the level of chemicals in the rawhide chews, it is impossible to comment on more clinical signs or possible sequelae. What is most prominent in this press release is this chemical(s) is/are not approved for use in this product in the USA. Products in treats or foods not approved for such use are subject to recall.

The press release also states the problem(s) at the production site(s) have been identified, inferring these issues will be resolved.

Hopefully few pets are affected and the pet treats will soon return to the market. - Mod.TG
