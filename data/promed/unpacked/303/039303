We are grateful to Dr McKinney for pointing us to the website of the
Burkholder lab:
http://www2.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/project/aquatic_botany/pfiest.html

There Dr Burkholder states:
>_Pfiesteria_ has killed every individual of every finfish and shellfish
>species that it has been tested within culture, among them blue crabs,
young >eastern oysters, littleneck clams, bay scallops, striped bass,
hybrid >stripers, mullet, croakers, spot, eel, menhaden, pinfish, flounder,
and >largemouth bass.
So the fact is that seafood of all sorts can be affected by _P. piscida_,
and would be toxic if eaten. But nobody is going to sell seafood that was
already dead when caught, or that has obvious lesions. So the question
remains whether there is any danger in eating fresh seafood that was still
alive when caught and has no visible lesion.
I am waiting to see a report of the first confirmed case of toxicity due to
eating a _P. piscida_ affected fish or shellfish.
