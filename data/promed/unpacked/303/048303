[1] Cholera - Uganda (Hoima District)

A cholera outbreak in Uganda's southwestern district of Hoima has so far claimed the lives of 6 people and left 130 others hospitalized, a senior Ugandan Health Ministry official has confirmed. In a statement released Thursday evening, 22 Oct 2015, Dr Asuman Lukwago, permanent secretary at the Ministry of Health, said that the deaths were a result of El Nino rain caused flooding.

In September 2015, the Uganda National Meteorological Authority and the World Meteorological Organization reported that El Nino was expected to cause flooding, extensive erosion, and mudslides with loss of lives, destruction of homes and food supplies at varying levels in some districts. The report had warned that Uganda and other East African countries would experience an El Nino effect from late October 2015 to February 2016.

The Ministry of Health said that 33 out of 112 districts in the country were currently at risk. "The incidence of infectious and non-communicable diseases such as malaria, cholera, asthma, typhoid, bilharzia, dysentery, and acute respiratory infections will rise to outbreak levels," Lukwago warned. "Some health facilities are likely to be damaged and many pit-latrines will be flooded in the affected districts," he said.

According to Fred Kugonza, district health surveillance officer, before the rains started, many people were not using pits as latrines. "Instead they go to galleys and trenches, and now with the heavy rains, the fecal matter is getting pushed into the lake, which is the same water they drink," he said.

At the Nkondo landing site where the outbreak began, Kugonza lamented that the biggest challenge they faced was the lack of safe water. "They only have one borehole which is 6 kilometers [3.7 mi] from where the outbreak took place; you can't tell someone to leave the lake and walk that distance for water," he said. About the Kaiso landing site, he said: "They have only one borehole and the latrine coverage is less than 20 percent and people keep moving from one place to another."

Kugonza also said: "I think we may get another bout of an outbreak in December [2015], especially in Kyangwali, the situation is terrible."

Kyangwali is home to over 20 000 refugees from Congo, Rwanda, Burundi, South Sudan, Somalia, and Kenya.

The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) of the United Republic of Tanzania has notified WHO of new foci of cholera outbreaks in the country. As of 13 Oct 2015, 13 regions have been affected, namely Dar es Salaam, Morogoro, Pwani, Kigoma, Kilimanjaro, Iringa, Dodoma, Geita, Mara, Singida, Shinyanga, Mwanza, and Zanzibar.

As of 19 Oct 2015, the cumulative number of cases is 4835 cases, including 68 deaths. The region of Dar es Salam accounts for 72 percent of all reported cases (3460). Zanzibar has reported 140 cases.

Public health response
----------------------
The national task force led by the MOHSW continues to carry out activities aimed at controlling the outbreak. Water sanitation measures have been implemented alongside health education campaigns. The MOHSW, WHO, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and the Field Epidemiology Program have joined forces to enhance surveillance and ensure a timely, coordinated response to alerts from the field. WHO and partners have provided support to the MOHSW in the establishment of 5 treatment centres in Dar es Salaam and Morogoro. To support risk assessment and response activities, WHO has deployed 2 public health experts who will assist in coordinating a multisectoral response that integrates surveillance, case management, and social mobilization along with water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions at the national and sub-national levels.

WHO-AFRO has deployed a WASH expert to conduct a situational analysis, provide technical guidance and leadership on key WASH issues, and contribute to the development of an effective response that includes WASH as part of a multipronged approach. In this endeavour, the expert is working closely with partner organizations, such as UNICEF, as well as environmental health focal points in headquarters and the regional office. Together with partner institutions in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), WHO is coordinating the deployment of international technical staff to support national response operations. WHO-AFRO has been requested to identify additional technical experts in public health event management, epidemiology, clinical case management, logistics, WASH, social mobilization, and data management.

[3] Diarrhea, suspected cholera - Nigeria (Ekiti State)
Date: Thu 22 Oct 2015
Source: Daily Times [edited]

Cholera epidemic looms in Ekiti State as no fewer than 300 students of the Federal Government Girls' College in Efon Alaaye, Ekiti State, are currently hospitalized. Our correspondent reliably gathered that the affected students who are currently receiving treatment at various hospital across the state including the state Specialist Hospital, Ado Ekiti, were not infected at the same time, but they were taken to the hospital in batches since last week [week of 12 Oct 2015]. Already, the development had triggered serious panic across the state, as parents whose wards are in the school rushed to the school in droves to identify the victims.

It was also reliably confirmed that the signs had started manifesting since 10 Oct 2015, when some students were vomiting and stooling uncontrollably, which sparked up fear among the staff and students.

The Principal of the college, Mrs Grace Ogunyomi, who initially managed the situation had to run to the state government for possible assistance when she realized that it was getting out of her control.

The State Governor, Mr Ayo Fayose, who promptly attended to their case, had ordered the Commissioner for Health, Dr Olurotimi Ojo, to deploy professionals and drugs to help in stemming the tide of the epidemic.

It was reliably confirmed that about 31 of them were still hospitalized at the Efon General Hospital, while many had been treated and released, having responded to treatment in time.

Daily Times further gathered that what the teachers had earlier suspected was that their food and water must have been contaminated, leading to an outbreak of the epidemic in the school.

But a teacher of the college who spoke with newsmen under anonymity confirmed that medical examination of the samples of their water and food later confirmed that the infection did not emanate from those sources.

"What we felt was that, we thought their food and water had been infected, but we later gathered that it was not from that source.

When contacted, the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Health, Dr Folakemi Olomojobi, who spoke on behalf of the Commissioner, disclosed that the disease had attacked about 300 students, but pointed out that only 20 of them are still being attended to while others have been discharged in batches.

Dr Ojo said, "We have taken their blood samples of students infected to the hospital and preliminary test shows that it was not cholera. It was diarrhoea and vomiting. We are sending the samples for further test to confirm that it was not cholera."

[4] Cholera - Kenya (Nakuru, Baringo counties)
Date: Wed 14 Oct 2015

http://allafrica.com/stories/201510141586.html


Following a cholera outbreak at the border of Baringo and Nakuru counties, 20 people have been admitted to Mogotio Health Centre in Rongai Sub-County, Nakuru.

County director of Public Health and Sanitation Dr Joseph Lenai who confirmed the outbreak [Wed 14 Oct 2015], said that all the infected patients, among them 11 females and 9 males, had been quarantined and put under close observation by medics. "No fatalities have been reported so far. We have mobilised our public health staff and launched an aggressive campaign to contain the disease," the official said.

According to the officer, the shortage of pit latrines in villages bordering Molo River had led to contamination of water leading to the outbreak.

[5] Cholera - Thai-Myanmar border
Date: Sun 25 Oct 2015

http://karennews.org/2015/10/cholera-outbreak-kills-12-karen-villagers.html/


As of the beginning of October 2015, 12 villagers had died and 61 villages suffered from cholera outbreak in Kawkareik and Kyain Seikgyi Townships near the Thai-Burma [Myanmar] border -- health workers from both countries are trying to stop the spread of the deadly disease. Statistics from the Karen Department of Health and Welfare (KDHW) show that most of the villages affected are in areas where government health services are inaccessible.

Naw Cha Eh Paw, a KDHW staff monitoring the situation said that the cholera outbreak was still spreading, but a lower rate. "In some areas, the outbreak has decreased, but in some villages it is spreading. However, if we compare it to previous months, it has decreased. During [October 2015] there was one death."

Health workers said that the cholera outbreak started in early August 2015 and KDHW, estimates that 217 people were infected by the disease in 2 townships.

[6] Cholera, suspected - Greece (Kos Island)
Date: Fri 2 Oct 2015
Source: Reuters [edited]
http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/02/us-europe-migrants-greece-health-idUSKCN0RW0Y120151002


Greek health authorities urged the public to take health precautions on [Fri 2 Oct 2015], after a suspected cholera case was discovered on Kos island [in the southeastern Aegean Sea], a tourist destination and entry point for migrants from the Middle East and Asia. An official for the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention told Reuters a 79-year-old Dutch tourist was transferred from Kos for tests and treatment in an Athens hospital with symptoms of cholera, including bad diarrhea and high fever, but the diagnosis was not yet confirmed.

"We are proceeding with more examinations to avoid the danger of a contagious disease," the center said in a statement. It told citizens to wash their hands and observe strict hygiene rules before consuming food and water.

Kos has seen an influx of thousands of migrants and refugees from countries including Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan who cross the Aegean Sea from nearby Turkey. In September 2015, Iraq's 1st major cholera outbreak since 2012 rose to at least 121 cases.

Cholera is extremely rare in Greece, with the last confirmed case reported in 1993 and before that in 1986, according to World Health Organization Data.

"There are fears that a case may have been transmitted through the migratory wave," the center official said.

The presence of high fever in this Greek case speaks strongly against _V. cholera_ as the cause, as most cases have little of no fever. - Mod.LL
