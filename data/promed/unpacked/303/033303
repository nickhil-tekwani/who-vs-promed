Colorado: 101 Cases of Undiagnosed Meningitis Reported during July
------------------------------------------------------------------
Even as West Nile virus infection cases rise in Colorado, state health
officials are investigating an unknown virus that causes strikingly similar
symptoms in people. Health officials said most cases of the new virus are
mild, but it can cause [aseptic] meningitis. The virus has hit hundreds of
people along the Front Range, said Dr. Ken Gershman, chief of the state's
communicable disease program. He did not have a specific number because the
state is not tracking the virus.
8 samples taken from patients were sent for analysis this week to the
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Patients
with the suspected virus can suffer symptoms nearly identical to those
afflicted with potentially deadly West Nile virus, including a rash. Other
symptoms include headache, muscle soreness and low-grade fever, all of
which can be West Nile virus infection symptoms.
Dr. Adrienne LeBailly, director of the Larimer County health department, is
working with state officials and the CDC to identify the virus. She said it
is probably transmitted by fecal matter, unlike mosquito-borne West Nile.
It also could be transmitted through respiratory secretions such as saliva
or nasal mucus. The virus is not at this time considered a public health
threat, LeBailly said. Gershman said the number of non-West Nile
virus-associated meningitis cases is at a record level in Colorado. There
were 101 cases diagnosed in July 2003, the most the state has seen since at
least 1996, when a new tracking system was introduced. The previous high
was 68 in July 2001.

[Aseptic (viral) meningitis is normally associated with enteroviral
infection. During the early part of 2003 outbreaks of viral meningitis have
been reported from Georgia in the south and Washington (State) in the
northwest. Echovirus 9 and echovirus 30 have been identified as etiologic
agents. - Mod.CP]
