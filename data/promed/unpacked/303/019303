[2] Infection among infants

van Keulen V, Huibers M, Manshande M, et al. Chikungunya virus infections among infants -- WHO classification not applicable.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Chikungunya virus caused an epidemic on Curaçao in 2014-2015. Infants are highly at risk for clinical syndromes as sepsis-like illness and central nervous system disease. Clinical recognition is important if laboratory tests, polymerase chain reaction [PCR] and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] are not available. The World Health Organization created criteria for identification of probable chikungunya virus. None of the studied infants met these criteria. We believe the criteria suggested by World Health Organization should be modified for infants.

[During the latest chikungunya fever outbreak in the Americas, no doubt a number of infants were infected in areas where local healthcare facilities did not have PCR or ELISA test capability. A reliable set of clinical diagnostic criteria is necessary under these conditions. - Mod.TY]

The absence of reports of chikungunya virus infections in many countries, especially in the Americas, suggests that incidence of infections has decreased substantially compared to the past 2 years. However, a few cases continue to be reported indicating that the virus has not disappeared from the western hemisphere. The main vector mosquito, _Aedes aegypti_, remains abundant in the region. It seems likely that the virus is endemic in the Americas and sporadic cases will continue to occur. - Mod.TY]
