As of 31 Jul 2011 (epidemiological week 30), 3 human cases of West
Nile infection had been reported to the Hellenic CDC (KEELPNO)
(http://www.keelpno.gr; in Greek). These are the 1st cases of 2011.

The onset of illness of the 1st case was 16 Jul 2011. All 3 cases were
neuroinvasive. WNV-specific IgM antibodies have been detected in
patient's serum and CSF [cerebrospinal fluid]. The location of cases
is Thessaly.

KEELPNO, in cooperation with the Ministry of Health, is closely
monitoring the events and information is given on a weekly basis in
Greek through its website.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Papa for this 1st hand report.

There was a total of 261 laboratory confirmed cases of West Nile virus
(WNV) infections in humans reported in central Macedonia as well as in
the district of Larissa (Northern Greece) in 2010 (see ProMED-mail
archive no 20110313.0809). One hopes that this year (2011) there will
be fewer cases.
