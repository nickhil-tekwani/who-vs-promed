[Re: ProMED-mail Rabies - Indonesia (08): (BA) canine, tourist exposed 20151021.3733684]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The posted report from Focus Taiwan unfortunately included several seriously inflated numbers, all of which serve to obscure the real issues afflicting rabies control on Bali, and indeed worldwide.

First, Focus Taiwan reported that "Lo Yi-chun, a doctor with the CDC... noted that between 55 000 and 60 000 people around the world die from rabies every year, with the disease most prevalent in China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh."

As I have pointed out many times -- most recently in ProMED-mail posting Rabies - Indonesia (08): (BA) canine, tourist exposed [20150420.3309817] -- this oft-cited claim that "between 55 000 and 60 000 people around the world die from rabies each year," is predicated on a projection of 20 000 rabies deaths each year in India alone, which originated with a survey of government hospitals done by David Semple and William F Harvey in 1911, at a time when India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan were all under British administration.

The Semple and Harvey survey was preliminary to the introduction of post-rabies exposure vaccination to India. It was in effect the "before" study, for which the WHO-sponsored National Multicentric Rabies Survey of 2003 and the Central Bureau of Health Intelligence data collections are the "after," all of them using essentially the same methodology. India experienced only 138 documented rabies deaths in all of 2013, according to the Central Bureau of Health Intelligence (CBI). The CBI has tracked human rabies fatalities since 2003, and has documented a general downward trend, with only a couple of upward blips, over that time. From 2005 through 2011, the CBI found, India had 274, 361, 221, 244, 260, 162, and 223 human rabies deaths, respectively: an annual average of 249.

This followed the finding of the 2003 WHO-sponsored National Multicentric Rabies Survey, led by M K Sudarshan. This survey found that human rabies appeared to be "endemic and stable" at 235 human deaths per year, based on data collected from government hospital isolation units. Since government hospitals administer free post-exposure rabies treatment, are the only hospitals that do, and are the only hospitals mandated and equipped to handle rabies patients, there is no reason to believe that substantial numbers of human rabies cases are occurring anywhere else.

The significance of overstating the occurrence of rabies, whether in India, any other nation, or worldwide, is that exaggerating the numbers of cases amounts to exaggerating likewise the amount of targeted vaccination of dogs and other potential carriers that needs to be done in order to eradicate canine rabies, in the places where it still occurs.

Exaggerating the amount of targeted vaccination that is necessary, in turn causes governments around the world to back away from funding it, and instead resort, again and again, to mass culling campaigns which tend to have little effect except to kill the tamest, most easily targeted dogs -- who often have already been vaccinated.

This is most of the problem in Bali. Another part, however, is constant repetition of grossly inflated guesstimates about the size of the dog population: "There are an estimated 500 000 stray dogs in Bali, but only half of them have been vaccinated against rabies." No, there are NOT "an estimated 500 000 stray dogs in Bali." The most recent systematic dog census, done in 2011, found barely 300 000 dogs on Bali, including owned pets as well as street dogs.

More than 300 000 dogs were subsequently vaccinated against rabies in campaigns led by the Bali Animal Welfare Association, with several other organizations participating.

This should have eliminated rabies, and very nearly did, with only one human death in 2013 and 2 in 2014, but then the Bali government took administration of the vaccination program away from BAWA [Bali Animal Welfare Association].

Further, beginning in mid-2014 the Bali government reinstituted what ProMED-mail called "a tactical canine cull in tourist areas," after having suspended such culling during the BAWA vaccination program -- and it was this more than anything else that enabled rabies to make a comeback, killing 17 people so far in 2015 according to my information (Focus Taiwan reported only 12 deaths.)

The problem was that the "tactical culling" amounted, as usual, to indiscriminately shooting, poisoning, and bludgeoning whatever dogs the cullers could catch, regardless of whether the dogs had been vaccinated and were wearing the red collars furnished by BAWA to show that the dogs had been vaccinated.

Every vaccinated dog appears to have been killed in some sensitive areas -- which has opened habitat to immigrant dogs from nearby rural areas, including dogs who have not been vaccinated because they are primarily nocturnal scavengers, seldom seen, and not easily caught. These are the dogs who have brought rabies back to the Bali tourism areas.

[Mea culpa. Mea maxima culpa. I should have caught the errors in the Taiwanese report and failed. The good news is that it gave Merritt the opportunity to re-educate us on the basic facts of canine rabies control, for which I am truly, most grateful. Which brings home the need to make sure that all vaccinated dogs are tagged. If this can be done, and it is cheap, a quick street check, for example for the red collars BAWA issued, will tell the observer what the current coverage is. Urban rabies is an eradicable disease. Let us hope that BAWA is invited back in for the rabies control in Bali and it is recognized in the street by the significance of their dog collars. - Mod.MHJ
