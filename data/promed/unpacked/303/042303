Aedes polynesiensis returns again to New Zealand
-----------------------------------------------
Another batch of potentially disease-carrying exotic mosquito larvae
has been found in Auckland's port, the 30th similar invasion in the
past 7 years. The larvae were found by quarantine staff on Monday [11
Oct 2004] in used tires being shipped from Rarotonga to Fiji via
Auckland. One of the species is suspected to be _Aedes
polynesiensis_, a potential carrier of Ross River virus and dengue
fever. Health Ministry spokeswoman Sally Gilbert said no empty pupal
cases were found, so it was unlikely any adults had hatched.

[Once again, this Pacific island mosquito, _Ae. polynesiensis_, has
been found at a New Zealand port. Although this mosquito was stated
as being a potential vector of dengue and Ross River viruses, it is
certainly not a major vector. Those interested in the appearance of
_Ae. polynesiensis_ in New Zealand should see the 1st reference below
on exotic mosquitoes in New Zealand. - Mod.MS]
