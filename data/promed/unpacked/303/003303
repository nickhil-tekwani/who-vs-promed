It is not official yet, but the number of measles cases in the United States in 2014 has hit an 18 year high. With over half a year remaining, the most recent count from official and media sources, completed 16 May 2014, shows that there have been 224 measles cases this year. That surpasses the previous high of 220 cases for all of 2011. The last time that the number of measles cases was this high was 1996. There were 508 cases that year. The following year the number fell to 138 and continued to fall. In 2008 it popped up to 140 measles cases before falling again.

From 2011 to date, measles has become a problem for public health officials in the US. There were 220 cases in 2011, just 55 in 2012, and 186 in 2013. The illnesses have appeared in clusters for the most part, although single cases have also appeared in many states. In 2014, there have been 3 large measles outbreaks. Southern California saw an outbreak from January through May [2014] that ended at 59 measles cases. New York City had an outbreak that stopped at 26 cases. Ohio is in the midst of a continuing measles outbreak that has, through 16 May 2014, infected 83 people.

In 2013, 3 outbreaks accounted for most of the measles cases. There was a cluster of measles cases in Texas that was tied to the Kenneth Copeland televangelism ministry and his mega-church. A cluster of illnesses occurred in North Carolina linked to a Hindu religious community and shrine. New York City experienced the year's [2014] largest outbreak in the Hasidic Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn. The latest national measles data from the Centers for Disease Control is for 1 Jan through 9 May 2014 and was released 12 May 2014. They have received reports of 187 measles cases this year from 17 states. Since that date, Ohio has reported an additional 23 cases, and there are new cases being reported in Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and other states. The measles cases in both Ohio and California in 2014 are linked to the ongoing epidemic of measles in the Philippines. Both outbreaks are a result of travelers returning from the islands who had not received the measles vaccine and who carried the illness back with them. At least 6 cases in Washington were in patients without immunizations with ties to a Dutch Reformed church in British Columbia that became the center of a 400 case outbreak of measles. The church opposed the use of all vaccines including the measles vaccine.

The measles outbreak in Ohio continues to drive the US total higher. The Ohio Department of Health reported on [23 May 2014] that it has now recorded 155 cases of the highly contagious respiratory disease this year. The state has seen 72 new cases of measles in the last 7 days. Using official and media sources, the year to date total for the United States is 301 measles cases through [23 May 2014].

The Department of Health provides some demographics for the measles patients in its report. The patients range in age from 6 months to 58 years. Female patients slightly outnumber male patients 80 to 75. 7 patients have required hospitalisation. Measles is among the most contagious illnesses known to man. The University of Michigan compiled a table of illnesses and compared their ability to infect. Measles ranked first, followed by pertussis. Feared illnesses such as polio and smallpox are far less contagious. The state of Virginia has had 2 measles cases this year [2014]. The 2nd patient caught their illness from the 1st. The contagious nature of measles accounts for the widespread effort of public health officials in Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia to warn the public of potential exposures in the last 2 weeks. Both patients traveled extensively in the area while contagious, working, exercising and shopping in many different locations. The Centers for Disease Control [and Prevention] describe the period in which a patient may spread their illness: Measles is highly contagious and can be spread to others from 4 days before to 4 days after the rash appears. Measles is so contagious that if one person has it, 90 per cent of the people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected with the measles virus. Because the telltale rash does not appear immediately, measles patients often believe they have a cold or the flu and continue their daily routines. The virus, spread in droplets from sneezing or coughing, can survive on surfaces for as long as 2 hours.

While measles outbreaks are taking place in several countries around the world, the largest at this time is in the Philippines. Several of the original measles cases in the Southern California cluster earlier in 2014 and the original illnesses in the Ohio epidemic were acquired in that country. CDC reports that 22 cases nationally can be tied to that epidemic with most being in infants that had not been vaccinated.

Health officials say 83 cases of measles have been confirmed in an Ohio outbreak that began among Amish who had traveled to the Philippines, which has had an epidemic. The state Department of Health reports cases of the highly contagious respiratory illness in 6 Ohio counties.

Knox County has the most with 52, 4 of whom were hospitalized. Neighboring Ashland County has 14 cases, with one hospitalization. There are 8 cases in Holmes County, 6 in Coshocton County, 2 in Wayne County, and one in Richland County. Officials are urging vaccination to limit the spread of measles and of mumps, which has caused a separate outbreak in central Ohio.

Coshocton County now has 6 confirmed cases of measles, part of the largest reported outbreak of the disease in Ohio since 1996. Robert Brems Jr,. Coshocton County Health Department health commissioner, said the 2 new cases are Amish men in White Eyes Township. Neither was vaccinated before the outbreak. 4 cases were previously confirmed in Coshocton with 3 in the same family in Crawford Township and another unrelated woman also in Crawford Township. All were Amish and had not been vaccinated. Brems said the men are not directly related to any of the previously confirmed cases, but they did report contact with those patients through work or the community.

The Ohio Department of Health said there are 111 confirmed measles cases in the state; 6 people were hospitalized for it as of [Wed 21 May 2014]. The bulk of the cases, 73, are in Knox County. It's believed the outbreak can be traced back to 4 Amish people in Knox County who had recently returned from a trip to the Philippines. Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease. The Coshocton County Health Department said 545 people have been vaccinated since the outbreak was announced. Brems said new cases could be reported for a while yet as the disease has a 3-week incubation period before symptoms appear.

As of [Wed 21 May 2014], the state health department reported 366 mumps cases in a separate outbreak. Most were in Central Ohio with none in Coshocton County. Franklin County had the most mumps cases reported with 301.

With measles cases on the rise nationally, South Dakotans should make sure their immunizations are up to date, the Department of Health said. "There have been more than 200 cases of measles nationally this year [2014], including 2 in Minnesota," Dr Lon Kightlinger, state epidemiologist, said. "South Dakota hasn't reported a case of measles since 1997, but we have had residents who were exposed to measles out of state. Up-to-date immunizations are the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones."

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease transmitted by direct contact or airborne droplets. It causes permanent brain damage for 1 in every 1000 patients and is fatal for 2 out of every 1000 patients. While measles is typically considered a childhood disease, it can be contracted at any age. The best protection against the disease is the measles vaccine (MMR).

http://kaj18.com/news/flathead-health-officials-proactive-against-measles-outbreak/


More than 30 people in Washington State have contracted the measles, a virus, that's practically been eliminated from the United States. There haven't been any documented cases of measles in the state of Montana as of yet. But several Montanan's have been exposed to over 30 people in the state of Washington who have contracted the measles virus and that's of concern to the Flathead County Health Department.

At the Flathead County Health Department, Director Joe Russell tells us that despite the fact that Montana appears measles free for right now, which may not last, so they are being proactive, "some of the consequences can be very serious, so we're a little concerned. We've done a really good job at basically eliminating measles. We've had more measles cases over the last year, than we've had over the last 10."

Many of those cases of measles could have been easily prevented by vaccination, something that Joe Russell at the Flathead County Health Department says has kept Measles at bay for many years, "So you start to get a little concerned again, do we have a pool of unvaccinated out there, are they under vaccinated? Those are all things that concern us, so when you start to see cases in Washington, start to see cases in the Midwest, we start to get very concerned."

Russell tells us that even if you are not a fan of vaccination, measles is not something you or your child want to contract. "We travel to Washington, Washingtonians travel here, it's inevitable that we could come in contact with measles, so we have to be concerned, there is no boundary anymore."

The Clay County Public Health Center confirmed 2 new cases of measles within the county Fri 16 May 2014, 3 days after a baby was confirmed to have the illness. All 3 cases are within a single family. The Health Center reported the initial case 13 May 2014. The diagnosed infant had just returned home with its family from an international trip when the symptoms were noticed. The infant received treatment at a local hospital, and household members of the infant's family began to receive appropriate vaccinations to stop the spread of the disease. In a statement, the Health Center confirmed the additional cases involved the mother and sibling of the infected baby.

"This disease can be easily transmitted from person to person in a closed environment. It is not unexpected to see a cluster of measles cases occur within the same household," director of public health Gary Zaborac said in a statement. Staff from the Clay County Public Health Center have continued to monitor members of the family since the initial diagnosis. Darrell Meinke, the health center's division director of administration said members of the health center had conducted visits to the family's home to monitor the current cases and look for signs of additional symptoms. He stated that no member of the family had been previously vaccinated for the disease.

While the Health Center continues to track the situation, it is encouraging residents to check their personal immunization status and that of their family members. 2 doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine are required for an individual to be considered immune. The health center is suggesting those who have not been fully immunized to schedule a vaccination with their health care providers. Missouri's immunization schedule recommends children receive the MMR vaccination for measles, mumps, and rubella when they are between 12 to 15 months old and again between ages 4 and 6 years.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of [16 May 2014], a total of 216 cases of measles had been reported in 18 states this year. The mark has already eclipsed the total number of cases that were reported in the United States in 2012 and 2013.

Health officials are investigating potential exposure to measles in Northern Virginia, Washington DC, and Montgomery County [Maryland] after a 2nd person was confirmed to have measles. The exposures occurred between [11 and 15 May 2014] at locations in Fairfax County, Loudoun County, and Arlington County, Virginia, Montgomery County, Maryland, and the District [of Columbia]. This effort expands the recent investigation of a measles case in late April 2014 in Loudoun and Fairfax Counties [Virginia].

The 2nd case of measles was confirmed in a person who was a close contact of the 1st case, officials say. Officials say the investigation is being conducted out of an abundance of caution.

One in 3 cases of measles in England results from overseas travel, show the latest figures on confirmed cases of the infection, published by Public Health England (PHE) today [23 May 2014]. There were 70 measles cases confirmed in England between January and March 2014 -- a significant fall on the figures for the same period in 2013 when 673 cases were confirmed, but an increase on the previous quarter's figures when there were 24 cases. Around 1/3 of all new cases (27) were the result of infection caught while overseas, and 16 were associated with travel to the Philippines where there has been a large outbreak.

During 2013, there were 10 271 cases of measles reported within the European Union [ECDC Surveillance report: Measles and rubella monitoring. February 2014. European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control; http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/measles-rubella-monitoring-february-2014.pdf] Of these, 8 were complicated by acute measles encephalitis and 3 people died. Today's new figures also show there were 847 confirmed cases of mumps in the 1st quarter of 2014, compared to 1036 cases confirmed between January and March 2013, and 520 cases reported in the last quarter of 2013. There were no cases of rubella confirmed between January and March 2014, compared to 3 cases identified in the last quarter of 2013.

"Although the number of cases in England remains low compared to 2012 and early 2013, the 3 deaths recently reported in Europe is a stark reminder of the importance of completing vaccination," commented Dr Mary Ramsay, PHE's head of immunisation. "With measles circulating widely across many parts of the world it is very important that before going overseas on summer holidays people are aware of their own and their family's vaccination status and ensure they have received two doses of the MMR vaccine," she warned. And she added: "Although mumps numbers are high they have decreased when compared to the same quarter of last year [2013] and remain lower than the levels seen in 2004 to 2005, when outbreaks were reported in several universities. This probably reflects the fact that most young people now attending university were eligible for 2 doses of MMR as children."

Two dozen residents of the Altai Republic have contracted measles, the 1st cases in the Republic for a period of 12 years. This is not yet regarded as threatening by epidemiologists in Novosibirsk, but they are warning local practitioners that they should not relax vigilance in view of the fact that Novosibirsk is a transit point for all the neighbouring republics.

Vaccination against the disease is included in the national immunisation calendar, administered ay one year and 6 years of age. However, it is possible to be vaccinated at a later age and adults up to 35 years of age can be vaccinated. Doctors warn that the infection is transmitted by airborne droplets.

Larissa Pozdnjakova, chief epidemiologist for the Novosibirsk region stated, "This infection is very contagious. You cannot ignore a single contact, and because the clinical manifestations develop very rapidly there is not time for delay."

The Health Department of Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) [Gujarat] has been jolted by 11 cases of measles being reported from Lohanagar area in ward number 9 of the city in the last one week. Health teams are now camping in the slums of Lohanagar and taking steps to prevent further outbreak of the disease.

RMC officials said this is for the 1st time that such a large number measles cases have been reported from a single area in the recent years. "A local doctor treating the children first spotted the symptoms of measles and immediately informed us to look into the matter. We have deployed eight medical teams and carried out surveillance. A mobile dispensary has been deployed to reach out to all the families likely to be affected. Although 11 cases have been reported so far, but none of them are serious. We are keeping a vigil in the area to prevent its spread," deputy municipal commissioner PP Vyas said.

All the children found showing symptoms of measles are below the age of 5. Sources said complications are more common in children under the age of 5 and unvaccinated young children are at highest risk of measles. RMC officials said they are finding it difficult to convince people in these slums to get their children vaccinated. Most of the people are poor with low levels of awareness. "We have surveyed 654 houses in this area with 3764 people and vaccinated 24 children,'' deputy health officer Dr PP Rathod said. "Our medical teams with pediatricians will remain in this area and will vaccinate all the children and take preventive measures,'' Vyas added.

http://www.soschildrensvillages.org.uk/news/measles-outbreak-sparks-wider-concerns-in-pakistan


Recurring measles outbreaks in Pakistan are a sign of a health system that is struggling more broadly to cope.

With more than 25 000 cases and 321 deaths last year [2013] in Pakistan, measles infections are becoming a growing concern for doctors and citizens alike. This was an increase on previous years and, worryingly, 1329 new cases have already been confirmed this year [2014]. These repeated outbreaks not only raise concerns about measles, but also that the government is not doing enough to combat preventable diseases in general.

Measles is included in the Expanded Programme of Immunisation (EPI), which has been running since 1978 and which also vaccinates against polio, tetanus, and meningitis. This programme should ensure that all children are immune to the most common preventable diseases, but it is failing to reach many. Ishaq Panezai, provincial deputy coordinator for the EPI, tells IRIN news [UN Integrated Regional Information Networks] that in Kalat district, where the 6 people recently died of measles, they are being told by local authorities that it is too dangerous to work there.

The unstable security situation certainly hampers efforts to vaccinate the population, as does the severe flooding caused by monsoon rains. However, many people believe that corruption is at the heart of the problem and this is borne out by a number of studies. Chief amongst them is a recent piece of research done by Quaid-e-Azam University in Islamabad, which cited corruption as the main cause of the high rates of measles infections.

The Lancet, a British medical journal, agrees, calling the Pakistani vaccination programmes "poor quality and ailing". According to a health employee in Quetta, medicines from government clinics are often stolen by employees and then sold to private clinics or shops, damaging the overall EPI mission. As Sikander Lodhi, a Pakistani economist, tells IRIN, this corruption extends to every sector in society, so tackling it will present a major challenge for those hoping to improve public health.

The national government has already moved to free up additional funds for the EPI and they are carrying out a Vaccine Management Assessment. This step has been welcomed by experts, but they remain cautious about the true impact it will have, given the scale of the problems faced. Not least amongst them are the generally low immunisation rates. At the moment 53 per cent of children are not vaccinated against anything, a shockingly high number.

There is some concern that the current approach is not broad enough and that the focus on polio is obscuring the challenges presented by other diseases, including measles. Most suggest that a holistic approach, similar to the original mission of the EPI, is the only way to safe guard Pakistan's children. However, to achieve this people will need to educated on the benefits of immunisations, since misconceptions are currently hampering vaccination programmes. Overcoming these challenges will be important for combating all disease, not just measles or polio.
