Pregnant women who become infected with hepatitis E, an acute viral
disease that causes liver failure, are at greater risk of death,
health experts say. Hepatitis E has been ravaging parts of northern
Uganda since October 2007 and has so far killed 97, while the number
of those infected has reached 5779, according to the latest update
report from the Ministry of Health.

According to Health Minister Dr Stephen Mallinga, the majority of
those who have died are pregnant women. "Because women have lower
immunity during pregnancy, cases of hepatitis E are severe and cause
more death among them," he said, adding that the problem is
exacerbated by some cultural beliefs that pregnant women should not
use latrines. As a result, most of the women will just dispose of
faeces in the open air, which is a good breeding ground for [i.e. the
spread of] the hepatitis E virus.

United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) Country Representative Mr
Keith McKenzie said the higher rate of death from hepatitis E among
pregnant women remains of grave concern. He said that most of the
pregnant women who succumb to hepatitis E are in their 3rd trimester;
this is usually the last phase of the pregnancy up to the time of
birth. "This is double mortality because not only are the mothers
dying but their unborn children too. We all need to play an active
role to contain the situation," Mr McKenzie said. According to a
World Health Organisation fact sheet on Hepatitis E
<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/>, overall
mortality rate from hepatitis E ranges between 0.5 to 4 percent, with
more cases registered among pregnant women. "Fulminate hepatitis
occurs more frequently in pregnancy and regularly induces a mortality
rate of 20 percent among pregnant women in the 3rd trimester."

A person infected with hepatitis E develops fever, headache, general
body weakness, muscle pains and eventually develops yellow eyes and
passes urine of a deep yellow colour.

Hepatitis E initially struck Kitgum District in October 2007, but has
since spread to the districts of Gulu, Pader and Yumbe.

While it is not easy to get infected with hepatitis E, the appalling
hygiene in the affected districts where many people displaced by the
Lord's Resistance Army insurgency live in squalid conditions in camps
has fueled the disease's spread. Dr Mallinga said in one camp for
displaced people in Kitgum District, up to 15 000 people were sharing
one latrine of 6 stances. "The major challenges are inadequate access
to safe water, unhygienic disposal of faeces, poor personal and
domestic hygiene," Dr Mallinga said, adding that bylaws should be
passed at the district and subcounty levels to compel households to
dig pit latrines.

The situation is made worse by the shortage of health workers,
inadequate funding and limited participation of local authorities at
the grassroots level in enforcement of bylaws and ordinances that
promote good health and sanitation. As a preventive measure, health
experts are urging pregnant women to attend antenatal services so
that early diagnosis can be made in case infection occurs.

An emergency plan to fight the hepatitis E epidemic in northern
Uganda has already been launched, and the Ministry of Health hopes it
will help eliminate the virus from the community. The UGX 10 billion
[USD 6.2 million] will focus on teaching residents about proper
hygiene, improvement of sanitation through construction of boreholes
and pit latrines in internally displaced people's camps, and
monitoring infected people to ensure they are treated. WHO says there
is no specific therapy for altering the course of acute hepatitis E
infection, and prevention is the most effective approach against the disease.

[The case count and fatality rate in this report are marginally lower
than those given in the preceding report from Kitgum on Fri 1 Aug
2008. However, the above report provides added details regarding
local customs and behavior that may be exacerbating the outbreak and
increasing the vulnerability of pregnant women. An earlier report
(Hepatitis E virus - Uganda (02): (West Nile) 20080512.1612)
suggested, in addition, that the 40 percent increased blood volume of
women in late stage pregnancy may be an additional factor in their
lower resistance to hepatitis E virus infection.
