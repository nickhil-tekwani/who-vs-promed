On [Mon 21 Oct 2019] South Korea's quarantine authorities confirmed the 11th outbreak of African swine fever [ASF] from wild boars near the border with North Korea, sparking concerns over the further spread of the deadly animal disease in the area.

The latest confirmed case was reported within a civilian control line near the border, according to the Ministry of Environment.

A total of 8 ASF cases [in boars] have been reported within the civilian control line this month [October 2019], while 2 cases came from outside of the line. One more case was confirmed from the Demilitarized Zone [see comment].

Quarantine officials have been making efforts to hunt down wild boars in the border areas, deploying hunters and installing traps. The authorities have hunted nearly 3000 wild boars since [Tue 15 Oct 2019], when South Korea announced it would deploy hundreds of soldiers and civilian hunters to areas bordering North Korea for operations to shoot and kill wild boars.

In contrast, no additional ASF infections from local pig farms have been reported since the 14th [outbreak] was confirmed [9 Oct 2019] [see comment]. So far, all confirmed cases from wild and domestic pigs have come from areas bordering North Korea.

In May [2019], Pyongyang reported its 1st outbreak of the disease at a farm near its border with China to the World Organization for Animal Health [OIE]. Still, it remains unknown how the virus traveled into South Korea. The disease normally spreads through direct contact with infected animals.

The disease is fatal for pigs but does not affect humans. As there are no cures available, South Korea has been culling pigs within a 3 km [1.8 mi] radius of infected farms to prevent the further spread of the virus.

Since mid-September [2019], when South Korea suffered its 1st-ever outbreak, the country has culled more than 150 000 pigs.

Additionally, the agricultural ministry is currently purchasing pigs from other farms outside of that range in selected towns to be slaughtered and inspected before their meat is released to the market. Pigs that are not purchased will also eventually be culled.

[The most recent ASF outbreak in S. Korea's domestic pigs involved a farm with 4000 animals where 4 clinical cases were observed; it reportedly started and was confirmed on 9 Oct 2019, located in Dapgok-ro, Gyeonggi-Do. The outbreak was notified to the OIE in follow-up report No 9 dated 11 Oct 2019, including a map presenting the location, at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=32087. Stamping out was applied, as in all other outbreaks.

Since then, only wild boars have been reported as infected. The last report (follow-up report No 12) on such (2) cases date back to 16 Oct 2019, both in Gyeonggi-Do along the border; their respective locations can be seen in the report's map, at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=32146. Today's added new case is yet to be reported to the OIE.

The Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) is 250 km (approx. 160 mi) long, approximately 4 km (2.5 mi) wide. The Civilian Control Line is a line that designates an additional buffer zone to the DMZ within a distance of 5 to 20 km (3.1 to 12.4 mi) from the Southern Limit Line of the DMZ. Its purpose is to limit and control the entrance of civilians into the area in order to protect and maintain the security of military facilities and operations near the DMZ.

Links to all reports, and a map presenting all S. Korea's ASF outbreaks (including cases in wild boar), is available in the summary report at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=31778 (click on the cluster, zoom in to the required resolution). The epizootic, which started 9 Sep 2019, is, so far, limited to a region adjacent to the border. - Mod.AS
