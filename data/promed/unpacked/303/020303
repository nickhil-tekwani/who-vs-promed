Precautions urged after woman dies of hantavirus
------------------------------------------------
A woman from central Alberta has died -- and her daughter and another
relative are in hospital -- after contracting hantavirus, health officials
say. One person in hospital is listed in serious condition, while the other
is in stable condition.
Doctors believe the 3 were cleaning the garage about a week ago when they
were exposed to deer mouse droppings, which is how hantavirus is spread.
"There is a need for the public to take precautions when they are exposed
to mice or mouse droppings," deputy provincial health officer Dr Karen
Grimsrud said, adding testing shows that there are infected mice in all
areas of the province. "You for sure don't want to sweep or vacuum the
mouse droppings.
"By putting that virus into the air and breathing it in is how you are
infected. You need to dampen it with disinfectant, then either mop it up or
wipe it up with paper towels and dispose of the paper towels in double
bags, and seal them." Health officials also recommend wearing rubber gloves.
Grimsrud says the case is unusual because it involves 3 people, where they
typically see single infections. "They have a common exposure. We've never
had that before," she said. "We've had single cases, but not the cluster of
cases."
Hantavirus is a respiratory illness spread by infected deer mice through
their droppings, urine or saliva. It is commonest in spring, when people
are outdoors or spring-cleaning and breathe in the airborne particles.
People first get flu-like symptoms, including fever and body aches, which
progress to breathing problems.
Since 1989, there have been 31 cases of hantavirus in Alberta, and 9
deaths. The woman, who died on Sunday, is the 1st fatality since 2002.
Health officials are warning the public to dispose of mouse droppings
carefully, and to thoroughly clean areas where mice have been.

[This is the 1st Canadian death from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome since
2002. It is quite rare that a cluster of 3 related family members were
infected simultaneously. The public is thus urged by the health authorities
to take precautions. When necessary, the guidelines mentioned above should
be strictly followed for disposal of rodent droppings from garages, attics,
and other storage places. - Mod.RY]
