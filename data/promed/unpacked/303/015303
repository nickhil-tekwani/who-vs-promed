A case of African swine fever (ASF) has been found in a wild boar in the eastern German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern [Mecklenburg-West Pomerania], close to a case found on a farm in the state earlier in November [2021], the federal agriculture ministry said on Thursday [25 Nov 2021].

The source of the farm case in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has been unclear as wild boar in the state were not previously reported to have the disease. The region is near Brandenburg and Saxony states where more than 2700 ASF cases have been reported in wild animals.

The case was identified in a dead animal near a motorway. Animal droppings caught in vehicle tyres have been known to spread the disease in other countries.

Wild boar wandering into Germany from Poland have spread ASF, which is harmless to humans but fatal for pigs and causes major loss of pork exports for countries where the disease is present. China and other pork buyers banned imports of German pork in September 2020 after the first ASF case was found in wild animals.

Germany has been seeking to contain the disease in east Germany and eradicate it by a protective corridor between 2 fences. In the zone inside the 2 fences the wild boar population would be reduced to zero by intensified hunting.

Germany said on Thursday [25 Nov 2021] it was continuing talks with China about "regionalisation" which stops pork imports only from regions of a country where swine fever has been found instead of a blanket ban on sales from the whole country. Analysts say Germany has been successful in containing the disease but continuing discoveries in wild animals means China and other big pork buyers may not lift their import bans on German pork.

[Genotyping will be decisive in confirming the suggested connection between the 2 events. Tracing back the route and chronology of ASF introduction into Germany's eastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is required for lessons to be learned and targeted control measures undertaken, hopefully preventing further spread. To this end, comparing the respective locations of both cases, and 2 points in time, will be helpful. The latter refers to the estimated time of ASF virus introduction into the affected farm, and the estimated time of the wild boar's death (see Mod.CRD's commentary in 20211118.8699737). - Mod.AS
