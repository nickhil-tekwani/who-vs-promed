Cuiaba this year [2009] has 7000 recorded dengue [cases]. According
to the latest data from the Municipal Secretariat of Health [SMS],
there are currently 6904 [dengue] cases reported and confirmed.
Although there is over 90 percent recuperation, a brief comparison
indicates that the Cuiaba situation is alarming. In less than a year,
there already have been more than double the cases reported in all of
2003, when the city recorded about 3000 dengue cases.

The reason may be the reintroduction of dengue virus serotype 2, says
the manager of the Disease Surveillance and Transmissible Diseases of
SMS, Flavia Guimaraes Duarte. "We do not know exactly what happened,
but this may be a factor for cases of greater numbers this year
[2009]. Now, during this season, the cases tend to fall because of
the dry season, but the expectation was for not so many deaths," he explained.

Dengue virus serotype 2 is a more dangerous type of dengue virus and
was out of circulation since 2003, indicated Guimaraes. This year
[2009], the state Secretariat of Health (SES) confirmed its return.
This may explain why the children have been frequent victims of fatal
disease, because they had no contact with the virus before. The
previous contact [infection] generates an immune resistance, but the
youngest children obviously had no opportunity to develop it, stated Flavia.

The Secretariat of Health of Bahia (SESAB) reported that dengue has
infected people in 90.6 percent of the 417 Bahia municipalities this
year [2009], but the rate of infection has decreased.

For the totals for the period between 1 Jan-22 May [2009], the
reports of the classic forms of the disease reached 82 402 in the
state, a number 220 percent greater than that recorded in the same
period last year (28 432) [2008]. Also included were 1415 suspected
cases of more serious forms of dengue and 55 confirmed deaths due to
the disease. An additional 54 cases are being investigated.

Despite the data, the totals of the advance of dengue indicated a
fall in the rate of infection in the population. In the week between
16-22 May 2009, 1483 new reports of the disease were recorded in
Bahia, the 2nd lowest of the year, a larger number only than that
recorded in the 1st week of 2009, when there were 1109 recorded [cases].

[This report describes a model that uses effects of climate variables
and vegetation indices on _Aedes aegypti_ populations to predict and
mitigate dengue epidemics in the American tropics. The new model is
reported to predict dengue fever epidemics with 83 percent accuracy
up to 40 weeks in advance of an outbreak and provide information on
the magnitude of future epidemics. It will be interesting to see how
the model performs over time. - Mod.TY]

Health Secretary Francisco T. Duque III launched Wednesday [3 Jun
2009] a nationwide anti-dengue campaign, reiterating that dengue is
more dangerous than influenza A (H1N1).

The campaign, dubbed as "Ako, Ikaw, Tayong Lahat Laban sa Dengue,"
was meant to increase the public's awareness on the 4S strategy of
the DoH to avoid dengue-carrying mosquitoes. The 4-S stands for
Search and Destroy, Self-protection, Seek early treatment and Say no
to indiscriminate fogging.

Earlier, Duque emphasized that dengue is "more fatal" than influenza A (H1N1).

"Right now, what we're seeing from the behavior of the virus (H1N1)
is that most of the cases are mild and are self-limiting. The case
fatality rate of H1N1, in fact, is less than one percent. Dengue is
even more fatal in the country, where we now have 57 deaths as of
April this year [2009]," he said.

The DoH disease surveillance report showed that from January to 9 May
[2009], there were a total of 6537 cases of dengue with 62 deaths as
compared to the same period last year [2008], with 15 334 cases and 163 deaths.

The figures reveal a 57.4 percent decrease in the number of dengue
cases compared to 2008.

"With the 4S strategy that was widely disseminated in communities and
schools last year [2008], people became more aware of how easy it was
to prevent the spread of the dengue-carrying mosquitoes," Duque said.

The highest number of dengue cases was in the National Capital Region
with 1174 cases; Davao region 1085; Calabarzon, 807; and Central
Visayas, 636 cases.

Clustering of dengue cases were seen in 3 or more barangays during
the past 4 weeks in the following areas: Metro Manila (Sampaloc,
Tondo, Novaliches, Dagat-dagatan); Calabarzon (Lucena City, Taytay);
Negros Occidental (Bacolod City); Cebu (Naga City, Lapu-Lapu City)
and Davao City, among others. [Barangays are the smallest
administrative division in the Philippines and is the Filipino term
for a village, district or ward. - Mod.TY]

Dengue fever has hit the Medical College campus here in
Thiruvananthapuram again, barely a month after the authorities had
managed to contain a major outbreak which had affected a large number
of house surgeons and laborers engaged in construction work on the campus.

In the past one week, at least 25 students of the nursing hostel and
the paramedical sciences hostel have been down with fever, and 4 of
them are currently hospitalised. With 3 cases already being confirmed
as dengue fever, this could be yet another outbreak of dengue, it is feared.

A team deputed by the district health administration and the
Prevention of Epidemics and Infectious Diseases Cell in Medical
College have commenced spraying activities in the affected areas
inside the MCH campus.

The outbreak in April 2009 had recorded at least 75 to 100 probable
cases of dengue, even though official figures spoke only about the 45
confirmed cases.

The epicentre of the outbreak had been found to be the new Super
Speciality block under construction, where water stagnation during
construction work had led to the massive breeding of _Aedes aegypti_
mosquitoes.

Those affected during the April 2009 outbreak -- the 1st one in the
district this year -- were mostly the residents of the House
Surgeons' Quarters (HSQ) and students of the nursing hostel. The
outbreak had affected the migrant labourers' camp as well as some
residential colonies adjacent to the MCH campus. One death had also
been recorded, that of a laborer engaged in aluminum fabrication work
in the construction site.

Following this outbreak, an intensive dengue containment and vector
control drive had been launched in Medical College campus by roping
in various departments, including the housekeeping divisions at
Medical College, the Medical Education division, the district health
administration, City Corporation as well as the ASHA and Kudumbasree workers.

A fever ward had been opened at the hospital with fever patients
confined under mosquito nets to prevent the infection being spread to
patients in other wards.

[One hopes that the involvement of individuals from various
departments and agencies is directed toward the elimination of _Ae.
aegypti_ breeding sites. Spraying may eliminate adults for a few
days, only to have new adults emerge from the breeding sites and
continue transmitting the virus.

Several newspapers and websites have rung alarm bells and warned
against a new epidemic of dengue fever, [caused by] a virus mainly
transmitted by mosquitoes that decimates mainly the animal but also
the human population. [Animals in Saudi Arabia would not be affected
by dengue virus infection. - Mod.TY]

"A horror gripped the people of Saudi Arabia after the appearance of
the dengue fever cases in Jeddah and Mecca," Mohamed Sayed Ali had
reported on 13 Apr 2009 on "Islamonline."

Quoting government medical sources, the official Saudi press agency
SPA had at the time announced "33 cases of dengue fever illness in
Jeddah and 103 in Mecca since the beginning of the month" [April 2009].

The daily "Okaz" had, on 12 Apr 2009, reported that a Saudi man and
woman, aged respectively 20 and 22 years old and afflicted by the
virus, had finally succumbed the previous day at King Faisal hospital in Mecca.

The following day, other newspapers had reported the hospitalization
in Mecca of more than 100 people affected by the disease. Most of
them were discharged from the hospitals after receiving emergency treatment.
