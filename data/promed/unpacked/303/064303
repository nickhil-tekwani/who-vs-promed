[Kasese District in southern Uganda, [at an altitude of over 1100 meters
(3000ft) - Mod.JW] is not considered a malaria low-risk area by the Ministry
of Health, Kampala. In the Integrated Disease Surveillance Bulletin March
2004, the Ministry of Health reported that Kasese district had 490 fatalities
due to malaria in 2003, which is considered relatively high compared to other
districts. Overall, Uganda registered an average of 137 415 malaria cases per
week in 2003, and visitors are well advised to take malaria prophylaxis in
the entire country all year round. - Mod.EP]
