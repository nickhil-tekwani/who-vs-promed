New Zealand: Suspected Case of New Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
--------------------------------------------------------------------
New Zealand may have its first case of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease [abbreviated as CJD (new var. or vCJD in ProMED-mail], government
officials said. The Health Ministry is expected to announce the case [see
part (2) below], after a CJD patient's progress failed to follow a normal
pattern. New Zealand gets about 3 or 4 normal [i.e. sproadic] CJD cases
annually, but has been waiting for the first case to occur among New
Zealanders who ate beef in Britain when infected meat was still being sold
there. The normal form of the disease can take between 10 and 30 years to
incubate in humans.
New Zealand's agricultural industry was gearing up to fend off any impact
the case might have on consumer perceptions of New Zealand meat. A
spokeswoman for the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry said that the
matter was a human health issue --- there was no mad cow disease, bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), in the national cattle herd. She said some
confusion had been sown by a incorrect British report that New Zealand was
about to report a foot and mouth disease outbreak. That rumour was also
wrong, but financial commentators said the speculation had left currency
markets "very nervous".
A medical expert had said a case of CJD in a New Zealander was "presenting
very unusually" and authorities had sent away [material for testing] which
would take one or two weeks to give a definitive result, a spokeswoman for
Agriculture Minister Jim Sutton said. "But there's no evidence of BSE in
our cattle herd," she said. Major concerns for health officials are
expected to be tracing the suspect case, and checking whether the patient
has donated blood.
[Sporadic CJD] occurs in about one in 1 million people annually. A gene
mutation that runs in families [accounts for] 5 per cent to 10 per cent of
cases of CJD. CJD, which is incurable and always fatal, can also be passed
on by tissue transplants and, in theory, in blood, but nearly 200 people,
mostly in Britain and other parts of Europe, [are presumed to have
contracted] the new variant form, vCJD from eating infected beef products
[but this has not been confirmed unequivocally. - Mod.CP].

New Zealand: MOH Notified of a Person with Undiagnosed Neurological Illness
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health has been notified of a Waikato man with an
undiagnosed progressive neurological disease. Neurologists are querying,
among other possible diagnoses, the likelihood that this could be
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). In New Zealand, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
is a notifiable illness and a central register is held at the University of
Otago. There are several types of Creutzfeldt- Jakob Disease including
hereditary, sporadic and variant.
Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease occurs in about one in one million
people, and accordingly New Zealand has about 3 deaths per year from this
condition. The condition was also linked to neurosurgery or treatment with
human growth hormone. These no longer pose a risk. This [form of CJD]
usually affects people in the 45 to 65 and over age group.
A new disease, variant CJD was identified in the United Kingdom in 1996 and
found in young people. Neurologists in Waikato have removed a tonsil from
the man, which has been sent to Australia for analysis. Variant CJD has
been linked with Bovine Spongiform Encephalitis (BSE) in the United
Kingdom. Infected cows were thought to have entered the food chain.
Information was first sent out to the health sector in 1996 following the
discovery of the disease in the United Kingdom. The Ministry of Health has
been continuously updating and reviewing policy in regard to this disease.
In June 2003, a CJD response group was convened to review sector needs for
information on CJD and to continue to advise the Ministry of Health.
Director of Public Health, Dr Colin Tukuitonga said the Ministry of Health
was closely monitoring the situation. "At this time we are uncertain as
what the illness is and we will await the results of tests before taking
any further action if necessary. "The public should be reassured that New
Zealand has had measures in place since 1989, and banned imported food from
the UK in 1996, to ensure the safety of our food supply," Dr Tukuitonga said.

[Most suspected cases of vCJD outside of Europe have not been confirmed,
except where the patients have resided for a period in the UK or other
parts of Europe at the height of the BSE epidemic. It is implied that the
New Zealand patient may have contracted vCJD in the UK, or another part of
Europe where BSE-infected cattle have been reported, but neither of these
two reports confirms this directly. More precise information is awaited. -
