Health officials are investigating how to stop a rise in cases of a strain of salmonellosis which can leave patients severely ill, the BBC has learned. Cases of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium DT193, rose 630 percent from 71 in 2004 to 518 in 2011 in England and Wales, said the Health Protection Agency [HPA]. DT193, which is most common in beef and pork, is also found in unpasteurised milk, desserts, and sandwiches according to the HPA.

It said in a statement: "The HPA study, which is ongoing, involves people who were ill being questioned about what they ate and activities they were involved in prior to becoming unwell. The aims of the study are to find any links between those who were unwell and give insights as to how to stop the increase in cases."

The total number of cases of salmonellosis in England and Wales has fallen from 15 435 in 2000 to 9133 in 2010, said the HPA on its website.

Health officials say most salmonella infections are not serious, causing only mild stomach upsets. Occasionally, however, particularly in the elderly or in people with weakened immune systems, they can be life-threatening and may need treatment with antibiotics.

DT193 is a strain of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium which has caused concern on the European continent because of its resistance to antimicrobials. A report by 9 European health agencies including the HPA in 2010 warned of a big rise in DT193, like _S._ Typhimurium DT104 during the 1990s.

It said: "Control measures are urgently needed to reduce spread of infection to humans via the food chain." The HPA said: "The best way for people to protect themselves from this infection is by following good hand and kitchen hygiene practices and also by ensuring all food, particularly meat, is thoroughly cooked."
