Mobilization against Yellow Fever in Paraguay Continues
-------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare (MSPBS) of Paraguay
has reported the confirmation of 16 cases of yellow fever (YF),
including 3 deaths; 7 of these cases, young people who visited rural
areas, are from the Department of San Pedro, and are related to the
jungle cycle of the virus. The other 9 confirmed cases, which include
3 deaths, are from San Lorenzo Municipality, outside of Asuncion
[possibly indicating urban transmission - Mod.JW]. Another 15
suspected cases are being investigated.

Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health is taking measures to contain the
disease in affected areas, and more than 1 million people who live in
or travel to these affected areas have been vaccinated. The Ministry
of Health obtained 2 million doses of yellow fever vaccine from
Sanofi-Pasteur, provided by the International Coordinating Group on
Provision of Vaccines of the World Health Organization, which arrived
24 Feb 2008. Brazil sent 850 000 doses [manufactured in Brazil. -
Mod.JW] and Peru sent 144 000 doses of vaccine, adding to the 300 000
Paraguay had in reserve.

To control yellow fever, which is transmitted through mosquitoes, the
Ministry of Health has strengthened vector control in the urban area
of San Lorenzo, where high indices of infestation of _Aedes _
[mosquitoes] were found. Fumigation and spraying activities are being
carried out with 17 heavy machines in the Central Department, giving
priority to the neighborhoods of Laurelty [10km/6 miles from the
capital, Asuncion. - Mod.TY] and surroundings, and syndromic
surveillance activities are being carried out [i.e., checking for
fever and other characteristic signs of the disease. - Mod.JW].

A team of experts from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO),
with an epidemiologist, a clinical virologist, and advisers on
immunization and emergency management, has been working in Uruguay
since 15 Feb 2008, and a laboratory expert from the Institute Evandro
Chagas (IEC), Brazil, is supporting the national public health
laboratory in the diagnosis of yellow fever.

The President of the Republic declared a state of national emergency
on 15 Feb 2008, and United Nations Agencies committed USD 20 000 to
support monitoring vaccination coverage in the Central department and
national communication actions. UNICEF made logistic arrangements for
the transport to Paraguay of vaccines from WHO, and the Paraguayan
Red Cross and the International Federation of the Red Cross are
collaborating in communication and information plans for the community.

Delegations of entomologists, epidemiologists, and laboratory workers
from Cuba and Venezuela are in Paraguay to support in their areas of
specialty. Municipal officials are promoting environmental sanitation
with the support of the army and the police, and the Ministry of
Education initiated the school year, planning vaccination and vector
control actions in schools.

A USD 50 000 project is also being executed, contributed by the
Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance OFDA/USAID, with USD 20
000 more from the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation
(AECI), for logistical support for the vaccination campaign,
including supplies, reagents, laboratory equipment and support for
epidemiological surveillance. PAHO has prepared a new proposal of USD
170 000 dollars to serve needs not covered by other sources of
support. Some 1000 posters and 3000 fliers on clinical care guides
for cases of yellow fever are being distributed in health centers in
Asuncion and in areas at risk from YF.

Yellow fever is a zoonosis of the tropical regions of South America
and Africa, which occurs in 2 distinct epidemiologic cycles: jungle
and urban. In the jungle cycle, the virus spreads among monkeys and
humans, who may be infected when they enter the jungle and are bitten
by [forest] mosquitoes infected with the yellow fever virus. Urban
yellow fever has long been eradicated from the Americas, with the
last cases occurring in Brazil in 1942.

[This reports one more case since yesterday, 25 Feb 2008 -- see post

with no information as to whether these 15 are rural cases or
indicate an extension of the incipient urban epidemic near the
capital. - Mod.JW]
