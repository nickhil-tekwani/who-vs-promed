Trials of Acambis Smallpox Vaccine Suspended
--------------------------------------------
Acambis, the Cambridge-based drug company that supplies the US
government with smallpox vaccines to protect the population against
biological attack, today suspended trials of the [vaccine] after
finding serious side-effects among some volunteers. With the US on
high terrorist alert, it fast-tracked orders for 209 million doses of
the [vaccine] from Acambis before it had been fully tested. Now,
intense monitoring has discovered that some of those [who
participated] in the trials suffered a major heart condition. The
drug has not been given to anybody outside the trials.
Acambis, headed by chief executive Gordon Cameron, is one of many
drug companies attempting to make a safer version of the only
licensed existing vaccine, Dryvax, which has been used for
generations. Despite its efficacy, Dryvax's manufacture, prepared
from [lymph collected from lesions on] calves' bellies, is seen as
dated.
The company's Acam2000 is a chemically produced version of the
vaccine given by injection. [The ACAM1000 vaccine, to which it is
presumed ACAM2000 is related, is a live attenuated cell
culture-produced vaccine derived from the Dryvax original - see
below]. Acambis was one of the companies that lost out in the bidding
for the contract to provide vaccines for the United Kingdom. That
deal was controversially won by PowderJect, whose founder Paul
Drayson was a major Labour Party donor.
Smallpox was eradicated in 1971 after a worldwide Dryvax vaccination
and quarantine programme organised by the World Health Organisation.
But the threat of [the use of smallpox virus] as a biological weapon
by rogue states and terrorists has led most 1st-world governments to
stock up on unlicensed vaccines to give to the public in the event of
an attack. The military and front-line medical workers vaccinated
since 9/11, considered most likely to come into contact with the
disease, have been given Dryvax from old stock.
As part of its contract with the US, Acambis was [required] to
[submit] the new vaccine to the normal trials required for other
[vaccines] and to [verify] that it was as effective as Dryvax, its
predecessor. The problems now appearing in the Phase III trials were
anticipated, because heart conditions had been noticed in previous
Dryvax vaccination programmes. It is unclear whether the findings
reported today are [attributable] to the intensive monitoring now
being conducted into Acam2000 or the product itself.

[A description of the derivation of the Acambus 1000 vaccine can be
found in an article in the issue of Nature Medicine for 9 Sep 2003
(Nat Med. 2003 Sep;9(9):1115-6.), entitled: "Clonal vaccinia virus
grown in cell culture as a new smallpox vaccine". Briefly, in order
to develop a modern smallpox vaccine, vaccinia virus was derived from
the existing Dryvax vaccine by adaptation for growth in a human
diploid cell line. 6 cloned and one uncloned vaccine candidates were
produced. One clone, designated ACAM1000, was chosen for development
based on its comparability to Dryvax when tested in mice, rabbits,
and monkeys for virulence and immunogenicity. By most measures,
ACAM1000 was less virulent than Dryvax. We compared ACAM1000 and
Dryvax in a randomized, double-blind human clinical study. The
vaccines were equivalent in these initial trials in their ability to
produce major cutaneous reactions ('takes') and to induce
neutralizing antibody and cell-mediated immunity against vaccinia
virus.
It remains to be established whether the cell culture-derived and
-produced vaccine is inferior to Dryvax, or whether the stringency of
the phase III trials procedure has been increased in the light of
more clinical assessment of the performance of the Dryvax vaccine. -
