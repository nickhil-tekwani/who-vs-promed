[It is now 17 days since the last report of a locally transmitted case in Wuhan -- 3 days more than 1 incubation period. In today's (Mon 20 Apr 2020) report, there are 7 new reports of locally transmitted infection, 6 in Heilongjiang and one in Guangdong. It has now been 27 days since restrictions were lifted in Guangdong and Heilongjiang, and it appears as though local transmission has been established in both Heilongjiang and Guangdong over the past 16 days or so, albeit the number of reported cases from Guangdong is decreasing..

According to the report above, a total of 82 758 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4632 deaths, representing an increase of 11 cases mentioned above, in the 24 hours since yesterday's (19 Apr 2020) report, and there were no newly reported deaths. 2 new cases were reported from Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases continue to be reported daily but are decreasing. And Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases.

As best as I can decipher from the machine-translated report above, there were 37 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, 2 in imported cases. There were 3 conversions from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 992, 180 of these are importations from abroad. It would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly.

As reported, on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world is watching carefully to see whether this is safe timing. There does appear to be chains of transmission ongoing in Guangdong and Heilongjiang that are of concern, but clearly the most concerning are the imported cases returning to China.

Cases continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 67.6% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the main contributor representing 32.6% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. 2 provinces reported no new cases, another 3 provinces reported less than 10 newly confirmed cases and another 9 provinces reported less than 50 newly confirmed cases. All signs of decreasing local transmission.

[4] Iran: 83 505 total cases, 5209 deaths
Date: Mon 20 Apr 2020
Source: Reuters [edited]
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-iran/business-as-usual-in-iran-as-malls-bazaars-reopen-amid-coronavirus-idUSKBN2221SY


Shopping malls and bazaars reopened in Iran on Monday [20 Apr 2020] despite warnings by some health officials that a new wave of coronavirus infections could ripple through the Middle Eastern country hardest hit by the pandemic. Iran has struggled to curb the spread of the highly contagious lung disease known as COVID-19 but authorities also worry that measures to limit public life to rein in the virus could finish off an already sanctions-battered economy.

Seeking a balance between protecting public health and shielding the economy, the government has refrained from wholesale lockdowns of cities like those imposed in many other countries, but has extended closures of schools and universities and banned cultural, religious and sports gatherings. Effective on Monday [20 Apr 2020], President Hassan Rouhani's government lifted a ban on inter-city travel and ended a closure of businesses judged to pose only a "medium risk" of spreading the coronavirus, across the country. "Medium-risk businesses like shops in... bazaars or beside each other in buildings like shopping centres will be allowed to reopen while respecting health protocols," Rouhani said on Sunday [19 Apr 2020] in a televised meeting of his coronavirus task force.

With that ban lifted, state television showed heavy commuter traffic resuming in the capital Tehran and other cities. The return to bustling urban activity drew concern and criticism from some health experts, the head of Tehran's coronavirus task force and the chairman of its city council. "I am seriously concerned about what is happening ... My fear is that people will not take the outbreak seriously," a doctor at Tehran's Rasulollah hospital told state TV.

"Everything depends on the degree to which people are respecting the health protocols. People should not think that the situation has become normal again," Mohammad Asayi, an adviser to the health minister, told state TV. "Stay at home!" he said.

No penalties
------------
The protocols call for Iranians to maintain social-distancing, wear masks in public, and wash their hands regularly, but are advisory only with no penalties for infractions. Health inspectors will visit reopened shops at random to help ensure compliance with those measures, government officials told state media. Rouhani said on Sunday [19 Apr 2020] "high-risk" businesses, including theatres, gyms, saunas, and beauty salons, would remain closed "until further notice". Mosques and shrines, he added, will stay shut at least until [4 May 2020], some 10 days into the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

But Alireza Zali, head of the government-run coronavirus task force in Tehran, cautioned that reopening businesses risked wider transmissions of the virus, Iranian media reported. "The most important point is that more commuting, especially through public transportation, adds to the possibility of the spread of the virus," Zali told state TV. A retired Tehran teacher, told Reuters by telephone that the city on Monday [21 Apr 2020] was busy again "like those days before the coronavirus outbreak. No one seems to care anymore". Mohsem Hashemi, head of the Tehran City Council, also warned of a resurgence of the disease "if the restrictions are relaxed too early", Iranian media reported.

The health ministry said on Monday [20 Apr 2020] the Islamic Republic's death toll from COVID-19 had reached 5209 among a total of 83 505 infected people. The 24-hour tally of new deaths, however, has been falling over the past days. A parliamentary report last week[week of 13 Apr 2020], however, suggested the death toll might be almost double the announced figure and the number of infections 8 to 10 times more, given the lack of widespread tracking and testing of suspected cases.

Many government offices had already reopened on [11 Apr 2020] with 1/3 of their staff working from home.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 792 759 including 42 514 deaths, an increase from 765 233 cases and 40 565 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York state, with 252 094 (31.8%) cumulative case reports and 4879 (17.6%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing. New York City had a cumulative total of 132 467 as of 2:30 PM on 20 Apr 2020, including 9101 confirmed deaths and an additional 4582 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

Daily reported case counts are high in New Jersey (3505 -- 12.7% of total), California (2159 -- 7.8%), and Connecticut (1853 -- 6.6%). In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, California, Michigan, Illinois, Florida, Louisiana, and Texas.

[Spain is 2nd globally in terms of the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. There were 4266 newly confirmed cases reported today (20 Apr 2020) and 4218 cases reported yesterday (19 Apr 2020), maintaining the plateau levels of 4000-5000 cases newly confirmed each day.

As of today (20 Apr 2020), totals of 200 210 cases and 20 852 deaths have been reported, up from 195 944 cases and 20 453 deaths in the preceding 24 hours (19 Apr 2020). The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is now 135.65, a continual slow decrease over the past 13 days from a high of 214.43 on 7 Apr 2020 to 135.65 today (20 Apr 2020). Spain has the highest case count in Europe and is 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 200 210 cases, approximately 61 217 (30.6% -- a significant decrease from prior proportions suggestion possible under-reporting) have been hospitalized and 5794 (2.9% -- similar decrease observation) admitted to the ICU (there is a note mentioning that some of the communities are providing daily prevalence data, hence my use of "approximately" for hospitalization and ICU data).

A map of Spain showing provinces (autonomous communities) can be seen at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/spain-administrative-map.htm and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7248826,43. La Rioja, Navarre, and Basque Country, the most affected communities by population-based rates, are located together in the north of the country. Madrid is in the northern part of central Spain, and Castile-La Mancha is just to the south of Madrid, with Toledo as its capital. - Mod.MPP]
