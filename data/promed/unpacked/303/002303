This may shock everyone, but the fact is that India does not have a policy to control TB. In 1962 there was one, and BCG [bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine] was the major tool. By 1990 we knew that in India, BCG offers no protection either against infection or progression of latent TB to active TB. So the Revised National TB Control Project (RNTCP), launched in 1993, adopted the WHO TB treatment norm of 85 percent cure rate by directly observed treatment short course (DOTS) of 70 percent of pulmonary TB cases.

India declared the national policy as 50 percent mortality reduction by 2015 from 1990 baseline, articulated in National Health Policy, 2002. In the absence of case-based TB surveillance, we do not know any population-denominator based data on incidence or prevalence of pulmonary TB -- and the 70 percent case detection achieved is based on guesstimates.

Wide distribution of drugs for treatment while infection is not targeted for control is the milieu in which development of drug resistance is inevitable. We keep blaming the private sector for drug resistance -- but why not set it right? We do not do that, but continue to blame private sector -- using it as an escape route without facing the deficient design of TB control, beginning with lack of policy.

Disease control is a public health term, which stands for deliberate reduction of burden of disease to a pre-defined level, and shown to be the result of intervention -- not merely due to secular trend. RNTCP has not defined what TB control is: I have repeatedly suggested a definition: 5 percent annual reduction of incidence of infection in under-5 children and annual 5 percent reduction of all childhood TB cases. Both are measurable -- baseline and annual.

India's HIV/AIDS control was designed indigenously and uses all available interventions applied simultaneously. One intervention alone, DOTS, will not control TB. We need multiple interventions and that idea with details has been submitted to RNTCP.

These details were published in the Economic and Political Weekly, 12 Jul 2014, under the title: India needs a national policy to control tuberculosis. [1]

We know how to control TB, but there seems to be no political will. Mine is a lone voice as of now. International attention and advocacy will help. TB control is essential for socioeconomic development -- annual loss to Indian economy is over USD 23 billion, while RNTCP's budget is only below half a billion.

"Abstract
---------
There is no policy in India for tuberculosis control and the centrally-run Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme has neither mandate nor agenda for TB control. There are short, medium and long term remedies for the maladies of the revised programme which are detailed in this article. TB is both a biomedical and a social, cultural and economic problem. Citizens must demand a national policy for TB control."
