Here is my comment regarding the new H5N1 outbreak in Viet Nam:
- it is not surprising indeed to observe that H5N1 is again present in Viet
Nam, since it could be the case in any other country.
- what is more worrying is that it could spread widely again and affect
once more a large part of the poultry sector.
- it is disappointing to observe that despite past, current, and planned
international assistance and financial contributions from international
donors, some basic issues have not, are not, and will not be addressed
sufficiently. Indeed, it would not require a large amount of funds to
strengthen the basic organization of animal health services particularly in
the field, through the establishment of new types of relationships between
the more than 30 000 private para-veterinarians working in Viet Nam and the
field veterinary services.
- instead of trying to follow the guideline below, preference is given to
upgrading of labs, training of central vet services, regional organization,
etc.
"Good organization of animal health services is the first precondition for
any successful application of animal health strategy, programs and
measures." (Guidelines for strengthening animal health services in
developing countries. Rome, 1991. FAO.)

very necessary for the success of disease programs. - Mod.TG]
