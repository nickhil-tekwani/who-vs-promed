The enthusiasm of Palamur University students in the Mahbubnagar district of Andhra Pradesh, 170 km from here, led to a chance finding of deadly anthrax [spores] in ground water of more than 26 habitations.

Dr Pawan Kumar, head of the department of microbiology, sent his students to the nearby villages to bring in water samples for a project, and they collected samples of the coloured water from open water bodies and tested them in the laboratory. Shocked by what he found, Dr Kumar sent the samples to the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, which he said confirmed his worst fears.

"The water has _Bacillus anthracis_ bacteria, which causes anthrax, a zoonotic disease that is transmissible to humans through handling or consumption of contaminated animal products," he said. The etiologic agent of anthrax, _Bacillus anthracis_, is a spore-forming gram-positive bacillus.

Although anthrax can be found globally in temperate zones, it is more often a risk in countries with less standardised and less effective public health programs.

Water samples were collected from Alampur, Devarakonda, Lingala, Aamanagallu, Atmakur, Khillaghanapuram, Papireddyguda, Midjil, and Kodangal. The water has been [presumably] contaminated from raw sewerage, blood and animal products from abattoirs.

"The villagers in these places, even in a tourist spot such as Alampur, drink this water day in and day out. They are suffering from unknown diseases, many with ulcers, so we want to go further and seek protected water for our people," Venkat Reddy, a student, said.

According Dr Samuel, Superintendent of Mahbubnagar Government Hospital, humans can become infected with _B. anthracis_ by handling products or consuming undercooked meat from infected animals. Infection may also result from inhalation of _B. anthracis_ spores from contaminated animal products, such as wool, or the intentional release of spores during a bioterrorist attack.

[This is a first. Water from cattle water troughs and ponds, where vultures had been bathing after feeding on an infected carcass, have long been found to contain this organism, usually only the spores, as the vegetative cells do not survive long in water. As this account refers to "coloured" water, we might consider that the contamination is primarily from blood spilled at nearby "shade tree" slaughter sites that had been handling anthrax carcasses. The account names 9 towns or villages providing positive water samples. So we can presume that there was a livestock anthrax epidemic in the Mahbubnagar district at the time of the sampling, in plain view but with an oblivious veterinary public health oversight, probably with human cases as well, as the exposure was significant, and if any cases were seen at any medical clinic, similarly unreported to the public heath authorities.

This brings home a point: Though many are hypersensitive to the threat of this disease, because of familiarity and concurrent poor health services, it can be severely under-reported, all of which results in ineffective control and surveillance.

Anthrax is a severe problem in Andra Pradesh. Just taking recent years: 2005 (39 outbreaks involving 20 cattle cases and 135 sheep and goats); 2006 (46 outbreaks, 8 cattle cases, 251 sheep and goats); 2007 (54 outbreaks, 35 cattle cases, 216 sheep and goats); 2008 (26 outbreaks, 24 cattle cases, one buffalo, 51 sheep and goats); 2009 (7 outbreaks, 19 cattle cases, and 58 sheep); and 2010 (6 cattle outbreaks, 27 cases; 7 outbreaks just involving some 58 sheep and goats). Human cases occurred in Andra Pradesh in 2008, and there were 65 cases with 17 deaths in 2009.

A structured proactive anthrax control and surveillance programme is overdue in Andra Pradesh. - Mod.MHJ]
