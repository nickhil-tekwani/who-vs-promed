REPORTED FOOD POISONING FROM SEA TURTLE MEAT - ZANZIBAR
=======================================================
[1]
[From Fiona Clark:]
---------------Original Message---------------
I have just received news of two recent cases of poisoning from
turtle meat in Zanzibar. The article below was sent to me from
a friend in Zanzibar - as yet, I have no more information, but
it seems that both cases of poisoning occurred within two weeks
of each other.
My friend wrote:

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Here's the text of an article that was in the Guardian, March 22 (I
don't know which Guardian, could be a Tanzanian paper):
"The Zanzibar Revolutionary Gov't is conducting investigations to
establish what kind of poison killed persons who ate turtle
meat on the island. Up to now 24 people have been killed by
the poisonous meat. The government chief chemist told the press
in Zanzibar that his office had already received the shell
of the turtle, samples of the blood of the dead people, and utensils
used in the cooking of the animal.
The turtle was fished out last week at Vitongojini in Chake Chake
District, Kusini Pemba region, and its meat was cut into pieces for sale.
About 201 people are said to have eaten the meat.
Early this week, the Zanzibar Minister for Agriculture, Brigadier
General Adam Mwakanjuki, said poisonous turtles originated from
Caribbean islands and that they had been injected with the poison
to prevent fishermen from eating them. He said this was because
of the turtle trade boom on the islands that greatly threatened
their survival.
Meanwhile, Zanzibar's main opposition [party], CUF, has sent
condolence messages to the families of the deceased at Msuka
and Vitongojini, Pemba. CUF said in a statement yesterday
that it has received with sorrow and sadness the news of
the deaths which he said was a big blow to the Zanzibari people. The
statement, signed by CUF secretary-general Shaban Mloo, said the
government's statement that the poisonous turtle came all the way
from the Caribbean Sea was a farce. He said it did not hold water
in that it was based on assumptions without any established facts.
We want a thorough research (postmortem) to be done at the University
of Dar es Salaam."
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
My interest in this comes from the fact that I left Zanzibar in
September 1995 after working with the Department of Environment over a three
year period to carry out a preliminary study of sea turtles and set up a
turtle conservation programme. As a result of our work, it is now illegal
to catch turtles in Zanzibar, but of course it still happens, especially in
Pemba Island, which is remote and very poor. The political aspects are
unfortunate - Zanzibar's first multi-party elections took place at the end of
last year. The previous single party, CCM, won - but there are
allegations of massivefraud, and some European governments are
withdrawing aid to Zanzibar because of this.
Concerning the recent poisonings, the Zanzibar Department of
Environment and Department of Fisheries do have some
literature on turtle meat poisoning, although judging from the
above article, this hasn't yet made its way to the press. There
was a case of poisoning (supposedly from a loggerhead
turtle) in the 1930s, so I wrote to Colin Limpus, who very
kindly sent us a copy of his 1987 paper on this subject
(in Covacevich et al. : Toxic Plants and Animals. A Guide for
Australia) and we included a section on poisoning from
turtle meat in our 1993 report on Zanzibar's turtles. Is there any
new information that we could send to them?
In the course of our work, we found tags showing that green turtles
from nesting sites in Aldabra, Europa and Tromelin, and loggerheads from
South Africa are found in Zanzibari waters. Has anyone heard of any other
incidences of poisoning from eating turtle meat in the Western
Indian Ocean region? Also, is anyone interested in pursuing
the subject? If so, I would be happy to help set up contacts.
I will try to get more information, and will post anything I find.
If anyone has heard more via a different channel, please let me
know what you have found out.

[From Scott Eckert:]
Fiona, Re. your message on Zanzibar, Marydele Donnely (Program
Officer for the IUCN/SSC Marine Turtle Specialist Group), Dr.
Karen Eckert (Executive Director of the Wider Caribbean
Sea Turtle Conservation Network: WIDECAST),and Dr. Anne Meylan
(Florida Marine Research Inst.), have already sent a
large quantity of information to the Gov. of Zanzibar. Karen and
Marydele were contacted directly by the Gov. of Zanzibar sometime
last week and through them the Gov. of Z. was put in communication
with other sea turtle colleagues with relevant experience in
this area. Karen has also put the Gov. of Z. in contact with
the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control.
Finally, they have also noted that the allegation of Caribbean turtles being
"toxified" to harm persons eating the turtles is absolutely without
merit, and that it is virtually impossible for Caribbean turtles to even
get to the coast of Zanzibar. I also know that Karen E., has had extensive
communication with AP, who released this article internationally and
they are busy following it up.
