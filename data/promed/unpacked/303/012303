Dead dolphins, sea lions found on Oxnard beach; natural neurotoxin
blamed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[A couple] were walking on the Oxnard Beach Thursday evening [18 Aug
2011] north of Fifth Street when they came across a grisly scene. "We
were having a really good time. We were with our dog, the sun was
setting and the weather was beautiful, and then we came up to the 1st
dead dolphin," she said. "And then we found another one, and we looked
up and we realized the beach was kind of scattered with dead
dolphins."

On Friday morning [19 Aug 2011], volunteers from the Channel Islands
Marine and Wildlife Institute found 4 dead dolphins and 4 dead sea
lions at a site not far from the power plant at Mandalay Beach.

"They were all different sizes. 2 of the dolphins were smaller and
appeared to be younger," [the woman] said. "We didn't understand what
was going on, and we felt very sad for the dolphins."

According to Tom McCormick, a marine biologist who has worked in
biological assessment along the Ventura County coast for more than 20
years, the deaths probably are linked to a natural neurotoxin called
domoic acid.

"People are quick to point the finger at the power plant, but quite
frankly the operators don't add anything to the water they use except
a little heat," McCormick said.

"At this time of year, you often get the red tides, and associated
with that are plankton species that produce domoic acid," he said.
"This is a neurotoxin that is picked [up] by the filter feeders in the
water. The smaller fishes, such as anchovies and sardines, eat the
filter feeders, and the toxins get concentrated in the animals that
eat the smaller fishes. Sometimes, you will see a sea lion on the
beach jerking and contorting due to this toxin -- it's really
heart-wrenching."

Ron Barrett, a field assessment volunteer who has been working with
the institute for 16 years, confirmed the animals died of natural
causes not related to the plant or to fishing.

"Basically, every year, we have a season where domoic acid presents
itself," he said. "Some seasons are worse than others. This year
[2011] has been fairly light in Ventura County."

The decomposing carcasses attracted a vast aerial crowd of seagulls,
buzzards, and vultures. "The bodies were covered with seagulls," [the
woman] said. "It was pretty gross."

[Domoic acid, an acidic cyanotoxin, a neurotoxic tricarboxylic amino
acid structurally related to kainic and glutamic acids, associated
with certain algal blooms and possibly produced by the diatom
_Pseudonitzschia_ is also called amnesic shellfish poison (ASP).
Domoic acid was named for the seaweed from which it was discovered,
_Chondria armata_, called 'domoi' in Japan. The toxic acid is
accumulated by marine organisms (including sea lions) feeding on
phytoplankton, anchovies, sardines, and shellfish. Domoic acid is
essentially a neurotoxin in mammals causing brain damage, neurological
dysfunction, and death in severe cases.

In 1987, several people died and more than 100 became ill after eating
blue mussels caught off Prince Edward Island, Canada. It was
determined by Canadian scientists that domoic acid had entered the
food chain when the mussels fed on a toxic algae bloom of the pennate
diatom _Pseudonitzschia pungens_ forma _multiseries_.

In 1991, in Monterey Bay, California, a bloom of _Pseudonitzschia
australis_ also produced domoic acid that was then concentrated in
anchovies feeding upon it. The deaths of pelicans and cormorants that
ate the anchovies were reported to be related to their exposure to
domoic acid.

Transient elevations of plasma BUN (blood urea nitrogen) levels, as
well as neurodegeneration of the hippocampus, and memory deficits have
been associated with near-lethal domoic acid exposures.
