The Malawi government Thursday [29 Dec 2005] announced that the
country had been cleared of any bird flu following the negative
outcome of laboratory results of bird tissues that were sent for
screening in South Africa 2 weeks ago.
Malawi was on 16 Dec 2005 hit with a major scare of bird flu after
thousands of migratory birds, known as Fork-tailed Drongos [see
commentary], mysteriously died in a hill in the central district of
Ntchisi, some 200 km east of the capital Lilongwe.
"The world must know that the samples have shown no presence of avian
influenza," chairperson of the country's Avian Influenza Technical
Committee Ben Chimera told journalists in Lilongwe.
Chimera said several tests were made on the sample tissues and the
presence of avian influenza had been ruled out completely.
He, however, could not state categorically the cause of the massive
deaths of the birds but said the birds might have died because of
heavy rains that fell in the area on the previous night.
Chimera said although the lab results were negative Malawi would
still ensure that necessary measures were put in place to contain any
infection of bird flu that might occur in the impoverished southern
African country.
Malawi's Director of Animal Health, Wilfred Lipita, told journalists
earlier that the country has not known cases of bird flu but added
that although birds sometimes drop dead from unknown causes, it was
very unusual for birds to die in thousands in a short time.
Local people in the area suspected the birds might have died from
sudden changes in weather, but environmentalists disputed this,
saying the Fork-tailed Drongos were migratory birds and they move
quickly if conditions were unfavorable in a particular area.
"In fact if there is sudden adverse weather, these birds stand a
better chance of survival than others because they move out very
quickly," Hastings Maloya, Communications Officer for the Mulanje
Mountain Conservation Trust told Xinhua.
The birds were suspected to have traveled from a long distance, as
one of them had a identification ring with numbers and the word
"Israel" inscribed on it.

[Regarding the identity of the affected birds, readers are referred
to Alan Kemp's response in posting 20051228.3696. A similar view on
their possible identity has been received from Dr Richard Thomas,
Editor of World Birdwatch, BirdLife International, UK: "Much more
likely is that they are Barn Swallows (_Hirundo rustica_), a northern
hemisphere migrant that congregates in huge flocks during the
non-breeding season in southern Africa (sometimes millions of birds).
Like drongos, they have forked tails. No doubt many of the birds in
southern Africa would have passed through Israel where one could have
been ringed".
It would help if the reference diagnostic lab in Onderstepoort would
provide an accurate species identification for the tested birds. -
