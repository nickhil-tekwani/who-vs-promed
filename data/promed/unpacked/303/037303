Blood Supply: American Red Cross and Canadian Company to Collaborate
--------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW YORK: The American Red Cross has entered into an agreement under which
it will become the majority stakeholder in a new company being formed to
develop ways to safeguard the blood supply from the threat of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in
ProMED-mail, the human form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or
"mad cow" disease. The company is a partnership with Canada's ProMetic Life
Sciences, a biotechnology firm that will own a 25% stake in the entity.
This is the first time that the American Red Cross has participated in such
an endeavor, said Chris Lamb, who is chief operating officer for the
nonprofit organization's plasma services division.
The group is making the move because ProMetic "has unique intellectual
property that is synergistic with the approach of the American Red Cross
scientific staff," Lamb told Reuters Health. Together, the 2 groups of
researchers will work to develop tests to screen blood and blood products
for vCJD. They also hope to perfect a method for removing the prions, or
misfolded proteins, that cause vCJD even before they can be detected.
Currently, there is no sensitive test for vCJD, no approved method of
removing prions from blood, and no cure for the disease, which causes a
fatal brain degeneration.
The partners are not yet discussing in any detail the science behind the
project, but Lamb suggested that one of the draws of ProMetic was the
company's affinity chromatography-based approach. In affinity
chromatography, prions are removed from blood by passing it through a
filter containing molecules that attract the proteins and keep them behind.
Lamb noted that while it "sounds intuitive" that it would be easier to test
for prions than remove them, a removal system may actually come first. "To
test accurately, you have to get to certain levels of sensitivity," he
said, "whereas with a removal system, you may know that [the prions bind
to something and so will be removed." According to ProMetic, such a removal
system could be validated and ready to use within 12 to 18 months. ProMetic
and the American Red Cross have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU)
outlining the terms of their agreement and hope to have the final deal in
place by the end of September.
No cases of BSE or vCJD have yet been recorded in North America and it has
not been proven that the disease can be transmitted through blood
transfusions. The American Red Cross recently announced that it will begin
in mid-September to refuse blood donations from people who have spent
significant amounts of time in Europe in the past 20 years or so. The
precautionary measure is expected to worsen blood shortages that are
already severe in some areas.

[In the absence of evidence that vCJD has been transmitted via blood
transfusion, ProMED-mail has resisted posting the ever-escalating
restrictions imposed on the blood supply in the USA and elsewhere. These
restrictions are likely in the near future to produce a shortfall in the
availability of blood for transfusion. However, the solution advocated in
this Red Cross proposal is a distant prospect. The statement that: "The
partners are not yet discussing in any detail the science behind the
project," allows me to avoid any comment on the circularity of the argument
advanced by the participants in this particular proposal. - Mod.CP
