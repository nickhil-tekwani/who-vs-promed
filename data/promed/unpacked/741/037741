Japan: Outbreaks of Measles at Colleges and High Schools
--------------------------------------------------------
There have been several measles outbreaks centering on 3 colleges and 14
high schools, according to the Infectious Disease Surveillance Center, the
National Institute of Infectious Diseases.
In June 2003, 60 freshmen at the medical school in Kagoshima University
were infected with measles. Some bedside teaching that was to be performed
in a teaching hospital 4 km from the university campus was cancelled. All
1500 medical and dental students were tested for serum measles antibody,
and negative students were isolated at home until they received
vaccination. Dr. Hiromi Yoshida, Dean of the Medical School, stated that
medical students were voluntarily isolated at home in order to prevent
further spread of measles, especially to hospitalized patients. The school
will begin administering the measles antibody test to all admitted students
and will give vaccinations beginning next year.
In Kanazawa Technology College, 70 students became infected with measles
and 26 were hospitalized between 8 May and 30 Jun 2003. The college
reported the outbreak to the regional Health Center when the number of
cases exceeded 20. The college called upon every student and employee to be
vaccinated, and 70 percent of them complied.
This is the first time that the Infectious Disease Surveillance Center has
collected information on an intra-school outbreak. High schools in Tokyo,
Miyazaki, and Ishikawa have also experienced outbreaks.
Vaccination law requires that measles vaccine be administered between the
ages of 1.5 to 7.5 years, but only voluntarily. About 80 percent of
children were vaccinated. MMR (mumps, measles, rubella) mixed vaccine used
in the late 80's caused some adverse effects, and the Japanese Ministry of
Health and Welfare stopped its use in 1993. Only measles vaccine is used now.
Dr. Kihei Terada, at Kawasaki Medical College said, "All colleges in the
USA demand certification of vaccination upon admission. The same procedure
should be introduced in Japanese colleges to prevent these outbreaks.
Medical schools should be the first to introduce the system as an example."

[Measles remains a threat wherever vaccine coverage is inadequate. The use
of the single vaccine as opposed to the triple MMR vaccine does not appear
-- in Japan at least -- to have resulted in a greater use of measles
vaccine. - Mod.CP]
