At least 525 people have been infected with the cholera bacterium in Ethiopia, according to health sources [information released] on [Tue 11 Jun 2019]. The Ethiopian Public Health Institute confirmed that the cause of the death of 16 people by this infectious disease caused by _Vibrio_ bacteria. The deadly epidemic occurred in Oromia, Amhara, Tigray regional states as well as the Addis Ababa city administration.

The majority of the casualties were recorded in Amhara, with 14 people, the local broadcaster FANA quoted, Beyene Moges, the deputy director of the institute, as saying in a press conference. Beyene also cited as saying that 19 samples were examined in a lab to determine the cause. Medicinal supplies were dispatched to the affected areas, according to FANA.

Cholera is an acute epidemic infectious disease and it is characterized by watery diarrhea, extreme loss of fluid and electrolytes, and severe dehydration.

Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) - Cholera outbreak (UN, DRC authorities, DG ECHO) (ECHO Daily Flash of 13 Jun 2019)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As many as 12 000 cholera cases have been reported in 20 out of 26 provinces since the beginning of 2019, including 260 deaths. The most affected are Haut-Katanga, South Kivu, Tanganyika, Haut-Lomami and North Kivu - the latter is also the epicentre of the largest Ebola epidemic ever in the DRC.

The Congolese Ministry of Health started a cholera vaccination campaign end of May 2019 for more than 800 000 people in North Kivu. As of 1 Jun 2019, nearly 350 000 individuals have been vaccinated with support from the World Health Organization and The Vaccine Alliance GAVI.

The DRC is prone to epidemics. There is an ongoing measles outbreak with nearly 100 000 suspected cases in 2019, there are over 2000 reported cases of Ebola and a high prevalence of malaria with over 7.6 million reported cases, including 7652 reported deaths.

[3] Cholera - India (Odisha state)

In a month since cyclone Fani battered Puri, cholera cases have spiked in the district. As many as 56 people have been admitted to the cholera ward of the Puri district headquarters hospital in the past 24 hours. With symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting, patients from Puri Sadar, Satybadi, Brahmagiri, Kanasa, Delang and Nimapara areas have been admitted to the hospital.

While the Chief District Medical Officer (CDMO), Amarendra Nath Mohanty cited that contaminated food and water as the reason behind spurt in number of patients suffering from diarrhea and vomiting, patients and their attendants blamed callousness on the part of the district administration as it failed to create awareness and take measures to prevent the disease outbreak.

"Since morning I have been suffering from loose motions and vomiting. How would we know that the piped water supplied to home is contaminated? Though some hospital staff visited our locality and provided chlorine tablets, it did not make much difference," said a patient.

Refuting the claims of an outbreak, the Puri CDMO said due to seasonal changes, people are falling ill. "Rise in temperature accompanied by lack of electricity could be the reason behind such illness. This apart, an imbalance in environment, stress among people and seasonal changes cause the disease. However, no outbreak or cluster of cases have been reported," the Puri CDMO added.

In past one week, more than 300 patients have been admitted to the hospital complaining of diarrhea and vomiting.

[As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
