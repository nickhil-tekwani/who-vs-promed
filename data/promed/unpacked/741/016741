[1] Liberia: 41 UN staffers now under observation

Liberia's United Nations peacekeeping mission has placed 41 staff members, including 20 military personnel, under "close medical observation" after an international member of its medical team was diagnosed with Ebola this week, the 2nd mission member to test positive for the deadly disease. "This measure is precautionary and meant to ensure no possible further transmission of the disease," the mission said in a statement Fri [10 Oct 2014]. "None of the personnel who are contacts have shown any symptoms but will be observed for the full 21-day possible incubation period."

The World Health Organization says 21 days is the maximum incubation period for Ebola, which is spread via the bodily fluids of infected people. The 41 staffers were identified as having possibly come into contact with the member of the medical team, whose name and nationality have not been disclosed.

The patient tested positive Mon [6 Oct 2014] and arrived in Germany Thu [9 Oct 2014] for treatment, the 3rd Ebola patient to be flown there. The St. Georg Hospital in Leipzig said this week the patient would be placed in a special isolation unit.

[2] West Africa: 591 Nigerians to Join Volunteer Group to Fight Virus

Nigeria's success in containing the Ebola virus disease has been hugely lauded by governments all around the world. Through the formation of an international volunteer group, the country is set to impart its knowledge and techniques about battling the virus to the countries that are most affected by the deadly disease: Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone. A total of 591 Nigerians have registered to join the Ebola volunteer group, which will be deployed to the aforementioned countries, The Nation reports. Minister of Health Onyebuchi Chukwu made the announcement yesterday [9 Oct 2014] while giving updates about eradication of Ebola.

Nigerian volunteers from different heath professions have been registering with us, willing to join the international force that will go to Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea to help out with the containment, and as of now, 591 Nigerians have already registered with us in 3 registers we opened in Lagos, Abuja, and Port Harcourt. Before we allow them to leave, certain conditions must be met; the President has to approve for them to leave Nigeria as volunteers." Secondly, they have to be given proper training on how they would avoid the disease and ensure that they don't get it. They have to be fully and properly trained according to our standards in Nigeria, which are fairly high," he said.

[3] Liberia: U.S. Ebola hospitals are going up ... slowly
Date: 7 Oct 2014 [note date]

http://www.npr.org/blogs/goatsandsoda/2014/10/07/354121449/the-u-s-ebola-hospitals-in-liberia-are-going-up-slowly


Last month [September 2014], the United States made 2 promises to Liberia. On 8 Sep 2014, Obama pledged that the U.S. would construct a 25-bed hospital outside Monrovia, the capital, to treat health care workers. They've been bearing the brunt of the outbreak: In Liberia alone, at least 188 health workers have been infected, and 94 have died. Then, on 16 Sep 2014, Obama announced a massive response to the outbreak, involving thousands of U.S. troops on the ground to train health care workers, deliver relief supplies, and build 17 Ebola treatment centers for the general public.

At the time of the announcement, Obama stressed that time is of the essence... Yet progress on the hospitals has been slow. As NPR's Jason Beaubien reports from Liberia, a month later, workers are still spreading gravel on the construction site of the 25-bed hospital. Standing on the side are dozens of locals looking for work. Without health care workers, the hospital won't be able to open its doors.

NPR's Nurith Aizenman is in Anniston, Ala., [USA] where officers from the U.S. Public Health Services, who will run the hospital, are [going] to get trained by CDC. Right now, she tells Morning Edition's Steve Inskeep, only 8 of the 65 people needed are there. "Quite a number of [officers] are being delayed for all sorts of reasons," she says. "I'm told not all of them have passports; they have to get all the vaccinations that you need to work in West Africa, so they're not scheduled to get this training for another 2 weeks."

And this round of training is just the preliminary 3-day course. "There's more training to come," she says. At this rate, the earliest the hospital can open its doors for business is possibly around the end of October [2014], about 7 weeks after the hospital was promised. "Maybe that is a reasonable amount of time to staff up a hospital from scratch," Aizenman says, "but reasonable amounts of time are a luxury that we don't really have in this outbreak." The 17 other treatment units that Obama promised are also under construction, though Beaubien reports that the U.S. military [only] expects those to be fully operational in 60 to 90 days...

[I suppose torrential rain and heavy equipment breakdowns are responsible for the construction delays. I would have thought that passports and visas would be expedited, and that AfriCom soldiers would have already had all the required vaccinations to permit rapid deployment in emergency (my personal opinion, not necessarily that of ProMED). Yellow fever shots have to be given 10 days before arrival to be valid. - Mod.JW]

[4] Mali: Vaccine being tested
Date: 11 Oct 2014

http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/11/6962039/ebola-vaccine-is-now-being-tested-in-west-africa


Mali has no known Ebola [virus disease] cases, though it shares a border with Guinea, the nation in which the outbreak began. According to The Guardian, 3 healthcare workers there have been given the experimental vaccine to test that it has no adverse effects. It's reported that 37 more workers will receive the vaccine in the coming weeks before it can be used in Ebola-stricken nations. The efficacy of the vaccine will largely remain unknown until it is used in areas hit with the virus.

The vaccine, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline and developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Maryland, has been fast-tracked in hopes that it can help turn the tide in the battle against the virus. Just a couple of weeks ago, it was tested on volunteers in the US and UK. Last month [September 2014], it was successfully tested in monkeys with no ill effects. It's not unusual for a typical vaccine to take as long as a year to go through the same process.

It's said that as many as 10 000 doses of the vaccine, which uses a [common] cold virus to deliver a inactive portion of the ebolavirus to the body, could be ready by year's end [2014]. The focus, however, is on protecting doctors and other healthcare workers in the region, with hopes that a reliable vaccine could bring more health workers to the area.

[5] Sierra Leone: Officials admit a 'defeat'
Date: 11 Oct 2014
Source: NY Times [edited]
http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/11/world/africa/officials-admit-a-defeat-by-ebola-in-sierra-leone.html?_r=1


Acknowledging a major "defeat" in the fight against Ebola, international health officials battling the epidemic in Sierra Leone approved plans on Friday [10 Oct 2014] to help families tend to patients at home, recognizing that they are overwhelmed and have little chance of getting enough treatment beds in place quickly to meet the surging need.

The decision signifies a significant shift in the struggle against the rampaging disease. Officials said they would begin distributing painkillers, rehydrating solution and gloves to hundreds of Ebola-afflicted households in Sierra Leone, contending that the aid arriving here was not fast or extensive enough to keep up with an outbreak that doubles in size every month or so.

"It's basically admitting defeat," said Dr. Peter H. Kilmarx, the leader of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's [CDC] team in Sierra Leone, adding that it was "now [Sierra Leone's] national policy that we should take care of these people at home. For the clinicians, it's admitting failure, but we are responding to the need," Dr. Kilmarx said. "There are hundreds of people with Ebola that we are not able to bring into a facility."...
