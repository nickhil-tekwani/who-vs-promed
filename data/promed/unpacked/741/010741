Avian influenza: the situation in France
----------------------------------------
The health situation with regard to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has deteriorated in recent weeks. The number of cases of avian influenza in livestock and in wildlife is increasing sharply in metropolitan France. With the approach of autumn, a period of risk due to the drop in temperatures and the start of bird migrations, the level of risk has been raised from "negligible" to "moderate" throughout the national territory. As of [Sun 2 Oct 2022], this change is accompanied by a strengthening of the surveillance of poultry farms and protective measures.

Since [1 Aug 2022] and as of [10 Oct 2022], 20 outbreaks on commercial poultry farms have been confirmed.

A press release [of 30 Sep 2022], in which the new measures are specified, is available at https://agriculture.gouv.fr/influenza-aviaire-face-des-mortalites-croissantes-en-elevage-et-dans-la-faune-sauvage-la-france (in French).
