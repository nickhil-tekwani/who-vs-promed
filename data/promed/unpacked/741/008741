Update: Influenza Activity -- United States, 3 Oct 2010 to 5 Feb
2011

This report summarizes U.S. influenza activity since the beginning of
the 2010-11 influenza season (3 Oct 2010) and updates the previous
report (1). From October through early December 2010, influenza
activity remained low in most regions of the United States. Activity
increased beginning in mid-December 2010 and continued to increase
during January and early February 2011. Influenza B, 2009 influenza A
(H1N1), and influenza A (H3N2) viruses all have been identified thus
far this influenza season, and most viruses in circulation are
antigenically similar to strains included in the 2010-11 vaccine.

Viral Surveillance
------------------
During the period 3 Oct 2010 to 5 Feb 2011, approximately 140 World
Health Organization (WHO) and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus
Surveillance System (NREVSS) collaborating laboratories in the United
States tested 116 255 respiratory specimens for influenza viruses; 22,
641 (19.5 percent) were positive. Of these, 16 496 (73 percent) were
influenza A viruses, and 6145 (27 percent) were influenza B viruses. A
total of 11 094 (67 percent) of the influenza A viruses were subtyped;
7845 (71 percent) were influenza A (H3) viruses, and 3249 (29 percent)
were 2009 influenza A (H1) viruses.

Influenza virus positive test results have been reported from all 50
states and the District of Columbia. The percentage of specimens
testing positive for influenza 1st exceeded 10 percent during the week
ending 27 Nov 2010, increased through the week ending 29 Jan 2011,
when 34 percent of specimens tested positive, and decreased slightly
in the week ending 5 Feb 2011, when 32 percent of specimens tested
positive.

Although influenza A (H3N2) viruses have predominated this season,
2009 influenza A (H1N1) and B viruses also have circulated widely. The
relative proportion of each type or subtype has varied by date and
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services region. From early
November through mid-December 2010, influenza B viruses accounted for
40 percent to 49 percent of influenza viruses reported in the United
States, with the largest numbers reported from Region 4, the
southeastern states. Influenza B viruses were predominant in Region 4
through the end of December 2010. During November and December 2010,
influenza A viruses predominated in all other regions and have
predominated in all regions during January and early February [2011].
More than 80 percent of subtyped influenza A viruses from November and
December 2010 were A (H3N2). However, the proportion of 2009 influenza
A (H1N1) viruses began to increase during January 2011 and accounted
for 50 percent of all subtyped influenza A viruses for the week ending
5 Feb 2011.

Outpatient Illness Surveillance
-------------------------------
Since 3 Oct 2010, the weekly percentage of outpatient visits for
influenza-like illness (ILI) reported by approximately 1700 U.S.
Outpatient ILI Surveillance Network (ILINet) providers in 50 states,
New York City, Chicago, and the District of Columbia that comprise
ILINet has ranged from 1.1 percent to 4.6 percent. Since 19 Dec 2010,
the percentage has exceeded the national baseline of 2.5 percent. On a
regional level, the percentage of outpatient visits for ILI ranged
from 1.8 percent to 7.3 percent during the week ending 5 Feb 2011.
Nine of the 10 regions (Regions 1 to 8 and 10) reported ILI above
region-specific baseline levels. Data collected in ILINet are used to
produce a measure of ILI activity by state. During the week ending 5
Feb 20111, 19 states (Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas,
Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico,
New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina,
Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia) experienced high ILI activity; 9
states experienced moderate ILI activity; New York City and 10 states
experienced low ILI activity; 12 states experienced minimal ILI
activity, and data from the District of Columbia were insufficient to
calculate an ILI activity level.

State-Specific Levels of Influenza Activity
-------------------------------------------
For the week ending 5 Feb 2011, the level of influenza activity was
reported as widespread by 37 states and regional in 9 states. The
District of Columbia reported local activity, and 4 states, as well as
Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, reported sporadic
activity.

Widespread influenza activity was 1st reported in Georgia during the
week ending 18 Dec 2010; an additional 13 states reported regional
spread of influenza activity for that week. By the week ending 22 Jan
2010, widespread influenza activity had been reported by at least one
state in each region.

Influenza-Associated Hospitalizations
-------------------------------------
CDC monitors hospitalizations associated with laboratory-confirmed
influenza infections using the FluSurv-NET surveillance system.
FluSurv-NET is a population-based surveillance network that was
created during the 2009/10 influenza season, when surveillance in 6
states was added to ongoing surveillance for influenza-associated
hospitalizations in the 10 Emerging Infections Program (EIP) states.
Based on EIP surveillance data, the cumulative hospitalization rate
(per 100 000 population) for 3 Oct 2010 to 5 Feb 2011, was 14.5 among
children aged 0 to 4 years, 2.5 among children aged 5 to 17 years, 3.5
among adults aged 1 to 49 years, 6.3 among adults aged 50 to 64 years,
and 18.8 among adults aged 65 years or older. The cumulative incidence
for all age groups since 3 Oct 2010 was 6.3 per 100 000. Based on
FluSurv-NET data, the cumulative hospitalization rate (per 100 000)
for 3 Oct 2010 to 5 Feb 2011, was 18.5 among children aged 0 to 4
years, 3.2 among children aged 5 to 17 years, 4.2 among adults aged 18
to 49 years, 7.5 among adults aged 50 to 64 years, and 21.3 among
adults aged 65 years or older. The cumulative incidence for all age
groups since 3 Oct 2010 was 7.6 per 100 000.

As of 5 Feb 2011, among the 628 FluSurv-NET adult patients for whom
medical chart data were available for analysis, the most frequent
underlying conditions were metabolic disorders (32 percent),
cardiovascular disease (30 percent), and asthma or reactive airway
disease (19 percent). Among 226 children hospitalized with
laboratory-confirmed influenza, 47 percent did not have any underlying
conditions, and 20 percent had underlying asthma or reactive airway
disease.

Pneumonia and Influenza-Related Mortality
-----------------------------------------
For the week ending 5 Feb 2011, pneumonia and influenza (P&I) was
reported as an underlying or contributing cause of death for 8.0
percent of all deaths reported to the 122 Cities Mortality Reporting
System. This percentage is at the epidemic threshold of 7.97 percent
for that week. Since 3 Oct 2010, the weekly percentage of deaths
attributed to P&I ranged from 6.0 percent to 8.4 percent, and 1st
exceeded the epidemic threshold during the week ending 29 Jan 2011.
Peak weekly percentages of deaths attributed to P&I previously were as
follows: 8.2 for the week ending 23 Jan 2010, during the 2009 to 2010
season; 7.9 for the week ending 11 Apr 2009, during the 2008 to 2009
season; 9.1 percent for the week ending 15 Mar 2008, during the 2007
to 2008 season; and 7.7 percent for the week ending 24 Feb 2007,
during the 2006 to 2007 season.

Influenza-Related Pediatric Mortality
-------------------------------------
As of 5 Feb 2011, a total of 30 influenza-related pediatric deaths
from 18 states (Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,
Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina,
North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and West
Virginia) and New York City have been reported to CDC for the 2010/11
season. Nine deaths were associated with influenza A (H3N2) virus
infection; 12 deaths were associated with influenza B virus infection;
3 deaths were associated with influenza A (H1N1), and 6 were
associated with an influenza A virus for which the subtype was not
determined. 20 of these deaths occurred during the period 16 Jan to 5
Feb 2011.

During the 2009 pandemic, 329 pediatric deaths were reported during
15 Apr 2009-23 Jan 2010. Before the pandemic, 65 influenza-related
pediatric deaths were reported for the 2008-09 season (through the
week ending 11 Apr 2009); 88 pediatric deaths were reported for the
2007-2008 season, and 77 pediatric deaths were reported for the
2006-2007 season.

Antigenic Characterization
--------------------------
WHO collaborating laboratories in the United States are requested to
submit a subset of their influenza-positive respiratory specimens to
CDC for further antigenic characterization. Since 1 Oct 2010, CDC has
antigenically characterized 564 influenza viruses submitted by U.S.
laboratories: 82 were 2009 influenza A (H1N1); 300 influenza A (H3N2),
and 182 influenza B viruses. All 82 of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1)
viruses were characterized as A/California/7/2009-like, the influenza
A (H1N1) component of the 2010-11 influenza vaccine. Of 300 influenza
A (H3N2) viruses, 298 (99 percent) were characterized as
A/Perth/16/2009-like, the influenza A (H3N2) component of the 2010-11
influenza vaccine. Two viruses (1 percent) of the 300 tested showed
reduced titers with antiserum produced against A/Perth/16/2009. Of the
182 influenza B viruses tested, 170 (93 percent) belong to the
B/Victoria lineage of viruses: 169 (99.4 percent) were characterized
as B/Brisbane/60/2008-like, the recommended influenza B component for
the 2010-11 influenza vaccine, and one (0.6 percent) showed reduced
titers with antisera produced against B/Brisbane/60/2008. 12 (7.0
percent) of the 182 influenza B viruses were identified as belonging
to the B/Yamagata lineage of viruses.

Novel Influenza A Viruses
-------------------------
Four cases of human infection with a novel influenza A virus have
been reported this influenza season. Three cases were reported during
November and December 2010 and are described in a previous update. On
25 Jan 2011, a 4th case of human infection with swine origin influenza
A (H3N2) was identified in a female child in Pennsylvania. She
developed symptoms of fever, headache, and lethargy on 6 Sep 2010. She
did not require hospitalization and has since fully recovered. The
patient reported contact with swine in the week preceding symptom
onset.

Antiviral Resistance of Influenza Virus Isolates
------------------------------------------------
Since 1 Oct 2010, a total of 364 influenza virus isolates have been
tested for antiviral resistance. Of the 158 influenza A (H3N2) and 119
influenza B viruses tested, 100 percent were sensitive to both
oseltamivir and zanamivir. Among the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) viruses,
the 87 tested for resistance to oseltamivir were 100 percent
sensitive, and the 33 tested for resistance to zanamavir were 100
percent sensitive. High levels of resistance to the adamantanes
(amantadine and rimantadine) persist among 2009 influenza A (H1N1) and
A (H3N2) viruses currently circulating.

MMWR Editorial Note
-------------------
Influenza activity, as measured across all CDC influenza surveillance
systems in the United States, began to increase in mid-December 2010
and continued to increase through the week ending 5 Feb 2011. Although
the timing of peak activity is not predictable, peak activity in the
United States most commonly occurs in February; however, substantial
activity can occur as late as May. Vaccination remains the most
effective method to prevent influenza and its complications.
Health-care providers should continue to offer vaccine to all
unvaccinated persons aged 6 months or older throughout the influenza
season.

Influenza A (H3N2), 2009 A (H1N1), and B viruses have cocirculated
this influenza season, with the predominant influenza virus varying
over time and by region. Influenza A (H3N2) has been the predominant
influenza virus in circulation in all regions except Region 4, where
influenza B predominated early in the season. Although a small number
of 2009 influenza A (H1N1) viruses were found to be circulating early
in the season, the proportion of influenza A viruses that are 2009
influenza A (H1N1) has increased over the past few weeks in several
regions. Thus far this season, all of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1)
viruses and the majority of influenza A (H3N2) and B viruses in
circulation that were tested are closely related to components
included in the 2010-11 influenza vaccine.

According to 2010 recommendations of the Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices (ACIP), health-care providers should offer
influenza vaccination to all persons aged 6 months or older throughout
the influenza season. All children aged 6 months-8 years who receive a
seasonal influenza vaccine for the 1st time should receive 2 doses.
Children who received only one dose of a seasonal influenza vaccine in
the 1st influenza season that they were vaccinated should receive 2
doses in the following influenza season. In addition, for the 2010-11
influenza season, children aged 6 months-8 years who did not receive
at least one dose of an influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine
should receive 2 doses of a 2010-11 seasonal influenza vaccine,
regardless of previous vaccination history.

Higher overall and age-specific rates of hospitalization often are
observed during influenza A (H3N2)-predominant seasons. Based on
FluSurv-NET surveillance data thus far, rates of hospitalization among
patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza are increasing. Rates of
influenza-associated hospitalization are highest in children aged 0-4
years and adults aged 65 years or older. This trend is similar to that
seen in 2007-08, the last season in which influenza A (H3N2) was
predominant. In influenza seasons before the 2009 pandemic, cumulative
end-of-season hospitalization rates per 100 000 persons obtained from
EIP surveillance data ranged from 7.7 in 2008/09 to 18.1 in 2007/08.

Since the beginning of this season, 30 influenza-related pediatric
deaths have been reported. More than half of the pediatric deaths this
season have occurred since 16 Jan 2011. Health-care providers are
asked to notify their local or state health department as soon as
possible when deaths associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza
occur among children.

Antiviral medications continue to be an important adjunct to
vaccination for reducing the health impact of influenza. On 21 Jan
2011, new ACIP recommendations on use of antiviral agents for
treatment and chemoprophylaxis of influenza were released. Antiviral
treatment is recommended as soon as possible for patients with
confirmed or suspected influenza who have severe, complicated, or
progressive illness, who require hospitalization, or who are at higher
risk for influenza complications. Antiviral treatment also may be
considered for outpatients with confirmed or suspected influenza who
do not have known risk factors for severe illness if treatment can be
initiated within 48 hours of illness onset. Recommended antiviral
medications include oseltamivir and zanamivir; recent viral
surveillance and resistance data indicate that over 99 percent of
currently circulating influenza virus strains are sensitive to these
medications. Amantadine and rimantadine should not be used because of
the high levels of resistance to these drugs among circulating
influenza A viruses.

[In brief: The onset of the influenza outbreak in North America has
lagged behind that in Europe and Asia and has differed in the
predominance of the H3N2 virus in the early phase of the outbreak. The
outbreak in the USA is continuing to develop, whereas in parts of
Western Europe it is beginning to decline. As elsewhere the pandemic
2009 (H1N1) virus has replaced the previous seasonal (H1N1) strain,
and the antigenic characteristics of the outbreak viruses have not
diverged significantly from those of the components of the current
northern hemisphere vaccine. The majority of clinical isolates remain
sensitive to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamavir.

It is recommended that health-care providers should offer influenza
vaccination to all persons aged 6 months or older throughout the
influenza season. All children aged 6 months-8 years who receive a
seasonal influenza vaccine for the 1st time should receive 2 doses.
Children who received only one dose of a seasonal influenza vaccine in
the 1st influenza season that they were vaccinated should receive 2
doses in the following influenza season.
