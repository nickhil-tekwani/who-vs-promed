UNDIAGNOSED DIE-OFF, PENGUINS - BRAZIL: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

Hundreds of dead penguins and other sea animals have washed up on Sao
Paulo state's shores, and scientists are investigating the causes,
environment officials told Folha Online news agency.

The Institute of Environment and Natural Resources said 530 penguins,
numerous other sea birds, 5 dolphins and 3 giant sea turtles have
been found in the coastal towns of Peruibe, Praia Grande and
Itanhaem, with more likely on other nearby beaches.

Sao Paulo University biologists and a wildlife research center are
looking into the possible reasons for the animal deaths, the
institute said.

Praia Grande authorities have ruled out pollution, saying preliminary
investigations point to starvation as the cause.

The most likely scenario for the penguin deaths is exhaustion and
hunger during their long migration from the waters off Argentina's
southern Patagonia region, said Andrea Maranho, a veterinarian for
the Sea Animal Rehabilitation Center in Praia Grande.

[Migration is exhausting for birds, and without a good store of fat
before the journey, they will not make it. What is unusual here is
that there are other seabirds, dolphins and sea turtles involved,
which makes me wonder if these animals all died at approximately the
same time from a related cause. Perhaps something like red tide?
Perhaps a small bloom? Maybe domoic acid?

In the past, migrating penguins have died of starvation, avian
influenza, and malaria. While some have suggested Newcastle disease,
there are no confirmed reports of penguins dying of Newcastle disease.

While there may be environmental reasons for the die-off, it has not
been indicated in this article that infectious reasons have been
ruled out.

If necropsies have found empty stomachs in the birds, it would be
nice to know what the fat stores of the birds are. Also, if it is
starvation, is this the same cause for the dolphins and the sea
turtles? Does this indicate over fishing of the same feeding area
these animals need for survival? - Mod.TG]
