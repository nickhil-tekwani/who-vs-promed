South Korea confirmed 4 additional foot-and-mouth disease (FMD)
outbreaks on Tuesday [28 Dec 2010], despite a month-long quarantine
effort to contain the highly contagious animal disease.

The Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said 3
cattle farms in the eastern province of Gangwon and a pig farm in
North Gyeongsang Province tested positive for the disease.

The cattle farms were located in Chuncheon and Hongcheon, about
80-100 km [50-60 mi] northeast of Seoul, and in Hoengseong, 140 km
[87 mi] east of the capital city.

The pig farm in Yeongju, with 13 000 animals, is around 230 km [143
mi] southeast of Seoul and relatively close to where the 1st
outbreaks were reported last month [November 2010].

All 4 farms had been quarantined as of Monday [27 Dec 2010] after
some animals started to drool excessively, refused to eat, and
developed blisters on their snouts, tongues, and hooves.

The 13 147 pigs and cows on the farms have been ordered destroyed to
prevent a further spread of the disease, with other livestock within
3 km [2 mi] of the Incheon farm and 500 meters [0.3 mi] of the 2
cattle farms to be culled and buried. (Does this indicate a change in
the pre-emptive culling policy, applying now a 3 km radius culling of
all susceptible animals around infected pig farms, compared to the
hitherto 0.5 km radius around both cattle and pig farms?. - Mod.AS]

Related to the latest outbreak, the most severe in South Korea's
history, the government announced last Wednesday [22 Dec 2010] that
it will opt to vaccinate cattle after nationwide quarantine and
decontamination efforts failed to prevent the disease from spreading.

It said over the weekend [25-26 Dec 2010] that vaccinations will be
expanded to counter new outbreaks in the southeastern parts of
Gyeonggi Province. More than 184 057 animals on 7500 farms and
ranches are earmarked for vaccination although the numbers may be adjusted.

After the 1st case was confirmed on 29 Nov 2010 in North Gyeongsang
Province, the disease spread to Gyeonggi and Gangwon provinces and
the city of Incheon, with a total of 60 cases confirmed and more than
471 000 animals ordered destroyed. There have been several other
confirmed cases of the disease from animals that have already been
culled, which are not counted in the total.

Seoul has so far mobilized 155 974 [confirmation of this high figure
will help] quarantine personnel to man 1226 checkpoints across the
country and to take part in the decontamination and culling process.

FMD is highly contagious and affects all cloven-hoofed animals, such
as cattle, pigs, deer, goats, and buffalo, although it is harmless to
humans. It is classified as a "List A" disease by the Paris-based
World Organization for Animal Health [see comment below], with
countries that report outbreaks barred from exporting meat.

["List A" is a term no longer in formal use; since 2005, all OIE's
notifiable diseases of terrestrial animals are included in one,
single list. Previously, diseases notifiable to the OIE were
classified into 2 lists, List A and List B, the former being of
higher priority (see ProMED-mail archive no 20050715.2016). However,
FMD, an extremely infectious disease, has indeed a special status as
the 1st disease for which OIE established a mechanism for the
recognition of "FMD-free Member countries." At present, 3 additional
diseases are subject to similar recognitions: rinderpest, bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), and contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP).

Countries (OIE Members) which are officially recognised by the OIE as
free of FMD, maintain a privileged status in relation to the
certification and veterinary requirements when exporting animals
(relevant species) and animal products, worldwide. Explanation of the
official procedures for members wishing to apply for recognition of
animal disease status is available at
<http://www.oie.int/eng/Status/en_procedures.htm>.

There are 2 categories of recognised Members, in relation to FMD:
1. FMD free where vaccination is not practised
2. FMD free where vaccination is practised

The updated list of FMD free countries, of both categories, is
available at <http://www.oie.int/eng/Status/FMD/en_fmd_free.htm>. The
Republic of Korea was suspended of its status as "FMD free Member
without vaccination" on 29 Nov 2010, following the notification of
FMD in Andong city. The timetable ("waiting periods") for the
recovery of FMD-free status is addressed in Article 8.5.9. of OIE's
Terrestrial Animal Health Code. The text of the said article is as follows:

"Article 8.5.9. Recovery of free status
----------------------------------------
When an FMD outbreak or FMDV infection occurs in an FMD free country
or zone where vaccination is not practised, one of the following
waiting periods is required to regain the status of FMD free country
or zone where vaccination is not practised:

"3 months after the last case where a stamping-out policy and
serological surveillance are applied in accordance with Articles
8.5.42. to 8.5.48.; or

"3 months after the slaughter of all vaccinated animals where a
stamping-out policy, emergency vaccination, and serological
surveillance are applied in accordance with Articles 8.5.42. to 8.5.48.; or

"6 months after the last case or the last vaccination (according to
the event that occurs the latest), where a stamping-out policy,
emergency vaccination not followed by the slaughtering of all
vaccinated animals, and serological surveillance are applied in
accordance with Articles 8.5.42. to 8.5.48., provided that a
serological survey based on the detection of antibodies to
nonstructural proteins of FMDV demonstrates the absence of infection
in the remaining vaccinated population.

"Where a stamping-out policy is not practised, the above waiting
periods do not apply, and Article 8.5.2. or 8.5.4. applies [see at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mcode/en_chapitre_1.8.5.htm>].

"When an FMD outbreak or FMDV infection occurs in an FMD free country
or zone where vaccination is practised, one of the following waiting
periods is required to regain the status of FMD free country or zone
where vaccination is practised:

"6 months after the last case where a stamping-out policy, emergency
vaccination, and serological surveillance in accordance with Articles
8.5.42. to 8.5.48. are applied, provided that the serological
surveillance based on the detection of antibodies to nonstructural
proteins of FMDV demonstrates the absence of virus circulation; or

"18 months after the last case where a stamping-out policy is not
applied, but emergency vaccination and serological surveillance in
accordance with Articles 8.5.42. to 8.5.48. are applied, provided
that the serological surveillance based on the detection of
antibodies to nonstructural proteins of FMDV demonstrates the absence
of virus circulation."

A decision of an FMD-free country to apply emergency FMD vaccination
(in order to control an outbreak), deserves to be seen also in light
of that country's international trade figures. In other words, the
effect upon export (and the possible delay of its renewal) should be
weighted vis-a-vis potential losses to the animal breeders/owners and
to the local market, on top of other issues such as animal welfare
and collateral damage to the countryside, agri-business, tourism etc.

Korea is predominantly an importer, not exporter, of animals (cattle
and pigs) and/or their products. According to the statistical data
provided by FAOSTAT (database of the Food and Agriculture
Organisation of the UN), the imports/exports of the Republic of Korea
during 2008 (=most recent available data) were the following:
Live cattle (heads): import - 208; export - 0.
Live pigs (heads): import - 1451; export - 629.
Cattle meat (including boneless meat and veal; in metric tons):
import - 210 644 (value USD 959 993 000). Export - 4 tons.
Pork (in metric tons): import - 322 851 (value USD 821 560 000);
export - 8249 (value USD 14 487 000).

The decision of the authorities to resort, eventually, to emergency
vaccination may have been taken while considering, inter alia, the
export statistics. It will be interesting to obtain more details on
the envisaged vaccination, its scope (quantitatively and
geographically), type(s) and age of animals to be vaccinated, and the
vaccine to be applied. - Mod.AS]
