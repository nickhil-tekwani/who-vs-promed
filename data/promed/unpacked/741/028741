SOYBEAN RUST - ZIMBABWE (ARCTURUS)

I have just been notified by Rex Tattersfield, Seed Co, [on 20 Feb 2003]
that soybean rust has finally been spotted in their 'trap crop' [indicator
or sentinel crop] at Rattray Arnold Research Station, Arcturus. This is the
third confirmed report in Zimbabwe this season. The epidemic is late this
year, and [has] likely been held in check by the unusually hot, dry
conditions prevalent for most of January.
Of note also is a very heavy outbreak of downy mildew, a disease which has
not been seen at high severity for about 20 years. Luckily, the most
susceptible lines are within the breeding programme, whereas the current
commercial cultivars are only [mildly] affected.

[_Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ and _P. meibomiae_ infect soybean, but only _ P.
pachyrhizi_ is of economic significance. The disease is prevalent in major
soybean production areas worldwide and is present in Argentina, Brazil, and
Paraguay. Yield losses range from 10 to 80 percent, depending upon
environmental and cultivar characteristics. Pathologists in the USA are
understandably concerned about possible introduction of the fungus into the
country via spores from sources in South America. If the disease becomes
established in USA, it would be difficult to contain, because there are
many susceptible hosts that could maintain the pathogen from season to
season. Resistant cultivars are being developed.
The fungus causing soybean downy mildew is _Peronospora manshurica_.
Systemically infected seedlings from infected seeds are stunted, with
mottled foliage. The disease is common but it rarely causes significant
yield losses (<10 percent). High humidity and cool temperatures favor
disease development. The fungus survives in infected crop residue. Spread
of the pathogen is by airborne spores. Disease management involves crop
rotation, plowing down of infected crop residues, use of resistant
cultivars, and fungicide treatment of seed. - Mod.DH]
