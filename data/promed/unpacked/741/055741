[Figure shows a map of what appears to be the Lombardy Region of Italy (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombardy#/media/File:Lombardie70.gif) with 2 pie charts:]
1. In the July [2018] legionellosis outbreak in Bresso: 52 cases, 4 deaths
[Bresso is a city with a population of 26 255 residents (2001) in the Province of Milan in the Italian region of Lombardy, located about 8 km (5 miles) north of Milan; (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresso). ProMED-mail previously reported this outbreak. See Legionellosis - Italy: (LM) fatal 20180727.5931959. - Mod.ML.]

2. In the September [2018] pneumonia outbreak in eastern Bassa Bresciana (towns of Carpenedolo, Montichiari, Calvisano, Visano, Acquafredda, and Remedello): over 150 cases; 121 were seen in an emergency room
[Bassa Bresciana, with a population of about 169 000 residents in 2014, is a zone in the southeastern part of the Province of Brescia of the Lombardy Region, near Lake Garda (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Brescia#/media/File:Brescia_Province_Map.svg and https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassa_Bresciana_orientale). - Mod.ML]

The numbers are those of an epidemic. And they have increased in the last hours. Cases of pneumonia in lower Brescia [Bassa Bresciana] region have exceeded 150. Six municipalities are particularly [involved] -- Carpenedolo, Montichiari, Calvisano, Visano, Acquafredda, and Remedello -- and 121 people [sought hospital care].

Investigations were made on the deaths of 2, an 85-year-old from Carpenedolo and a 69-year-old from Mezzane di Calvisano from Brescia, to assess whether the deaths are related to the cases of pneumonia in the Lower Bresciana Orientale. "According to ATS [L'Agenzia di Tutela della Salute (ATS) or The Health Protection Agency], both deaths in the affected district of pneumonia cases are not due to [legionellosis]," ANSA was told by mayor Stefano Tramonti of Carpenedolo, a town in Brescia.

[However,] the hypothesis of a bacterium present in water is not excluded. The cases bring to mind the [legionellosis] emergency that broke out in July [2018] in Bresso, a municipality in Milan's hinterland. "Of the 121 cases who sought 1st aid for pneumonia, 109 are resident or domiciled in the territory of ATS Brescia, and 12 are resident or domiciled in ATS Valpadana. A total of 107 are hospitalized," says the Lombardy Region commissioner Giulio Gallera. The Istituto Superiore di Sanita is also involved in the assessment of the situation.

Yesterday afternoon [Sat 8 Sep 2018] in Brescia, a summit was held between ATS, the health protection agency, and those responsible for the aqueducts of the Lower Brescia region to assess the possible connection between cases of pneumonia and the presence of a bacterium in the water. "The supervisory staff of the Department of Hygiene and Health Prevention and of the Public Health Laboratory of ATS Brescia," Gallera explained, "is engaged in the verification of the water network of the municipalities concerned; in particular, the hygiene technicians are carrying out sampling of drinking water while the laboratory has ongoing specific analyses whose outcomes will be available in the coming days."

Meanwhile, ATS has sent a note to the mayors of the municipalities of Brescia with some rules to be followed at this stage, even if it was assured that "there is no risk of using food and [potable?] water and there is no restriction to the normal development of the activity in the various communities, between schools and workplaces" underlying the Lombardy Region. Among the requests made to the population, there are those to replace the filters of the taps or to wash them with anti-limescale, to let the hot water flow and then the cold before using it, and to move away from the emission point after opening the taps and opening the windows. It is also suggested to bring the hot water temperature to 70-80 deg C [158-176 deg F] for 3 consecutive days, ensuring its outflow from all dispensing points for at least 30 minutes a day. In July [2018] in the Milan hinterland, the [legionellosis] emergency broke out: 52 cases confirmed, 4 dead.

[ProMED-mail thanks Remigio Russo for submitting this news report of a pneumonia outbreak in Bassa Bresciana, in the Province of Brescia in the Lombardy Region of Italy. ProMED-mail recently reported on a legionellosis outbreak in nearby Bresso, a city in the Province of Milan, also in the Lombardy region.

Legionnaires' disease, a form of pneumonia caused by _Legionella_, a water-borne bacterium, occurs most commonly in people with advanced age and underlying medical conditions. The underlying medical conditions are often found to be the cause of death at autopsy, although legionellosis is likely a contributing factor. Such may be the case for the 2 deaths in the current pneumonia outbreak in Bassa Bresciana. More information would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources on the microbial diagnoses on the more than 150 cases of pneumonia in Bassa Bresciana. The suspected source for this outbreak is said to be a water-borne bacterium, which suggests it may be _Legionella_; but how many patients had a positive urinary antigen test or sputum culture for this organism? Genotyping the _Legionella_ strains isolated sputum will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease is based only on a positive urinary antigen test, there will be no isolates for genotyping. - Mod.ML
