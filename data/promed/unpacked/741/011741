The National Coordinator, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Chikwe Ihekweazu, on [Tue 30 Jan 2018], said 21 deaths were recorded from the 77 confirmed cases in the current outbreak of Lassa fever in Nigeria.

Mr Ihekweazu disclosed this at the opening ceremony of the National Executive Council meeting of the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) in Abuja on [Tue 30 Jan 2018]. He said of the 77 confirmed cases, 10 affected health workers.

The national coordinator quoted Sylvanus Okogbeni, Chief Medical Director, Irrua Specialist Hospital, Edo State, as confirming that 2 of the health workers affected were discharged on [Mon 29 Jan 2018].

He described the situation as sober, adding that it had resulted in serious emotional trauma, fear, anxiety, and sometimes anger among stakeholders.

Dr Ihekweazu said it was high time stakeholders came together and addressed the challenges of hemorrhagic fevers, including Lassa fever.

The national coordinator said NCDC has distributed more ribavirin drugs used in the treatment of the disease to the affected states than it had ever done in the past. He said government alone might not be able to supply the needed drugs to all the affected persons in the country.

Mr Ihekweazu said the centre had produced guidelines for the prevention and control of hemorrhagic fevers, adding that the NARD members should work with their hospitals' chief medical directors to address outbreaks.

In his remarks, Prof Mike Ogrima, President, Nigeria Medical Association (NMA), urged doctors in the country not to attend to patients if they did not have protective gear. "You have to get some level of immunity or protection before you provide services to such patients,'' he said.

Lassa fever is a viral infection caused by the Lassa fever virus and the disease occurs all year round but more cases are recorded during the dry season.

It is spread through direct contact with urine, faeces, saliva, or blood of infected rats, eating food, or drinking contaminated water.

The disease can be prevented through enhanced personal hygiene, avoidance of all contact with rats (dead or alive), and keeping the house and surrounding [areas] clean always.

In Taraba State, 3 people have been reportedly killed by Lassa fever following the outbreak of the disease in the state.

Besides, 3 other persons who tested positive to the killer disease have been placed under close monitoring as the total number of cases reported in the state rose to 12.

This is coming just as the Chief Epidemiologist of the state, Dr Udi Aketemo, warned indigenes and residents of the state against eating rat which is a common delicacy in the state.

The Surveillance Officer of World Health Organisation (WHO) in the state, Dr Bello Ahmed, who disclosed this yesterday [30 Jan 2018] in Jalingo at a sensitisation workshop on Lassa fever organised by the state ministry of health, stated that two people died in Jalingo Local Government Area while the third casualty was recorded at Ardo Kola Local Government Area.

He further revealed that 6 local government councils in the state, namely Bali, Gashaka, Gassol, Ibi, and Jalingo, as well as Ardo Kola have been placed on red alert due to the outbreak of the disease in the councils.

Ahmed, who was represented at the occasion by Dr Zero Philip, noted that the infection rate in the state is now put at 25 percent which he described as being very high based on the survey conducted across the country between [1-28 Jan 2018] among 367 contacts identified across the country.

To combat the scourge, he stated that WHO is collaborating with the federal government to develop a test kit for rapid diagnosis and reduce pressure on the diagnosis centre at Irrua Specialist Hospital in Edo state. According to him, "We are planning a collaboration with the federal government to develop a test kit for rapid diagnosis to complement the diagnosis centre at Irrua Specialist Hospital. "We want to call on the federal government to consider the establishment of at least one diagnostic and treatment centre in each of the zones across the country to effectively tackle the spread of the disease."

Besides cautioning the people of the state against eating rats, Aketemo equally advised residents to maintain good hygienic practices, eat only well processed foods, and adhere strictly to universal best health practices to avoid contacting the deadly disease.

Also speaking at the occasion, the state Commissioner for Health, Dr Innocent Vakkai, said the workshop was part of the state government efforts at creating awareness to mitigate the spread of the disease.

Meanwhile, determined to curb the spread of Lassa fever in Ondo state, the state government has directed that henceforth, all cases of 'sudden death' must be brought to the notice of health officials at local governments. The Commissioner for Health, Dr Wahab Adegbenro, [issued] the directive at a meeting held with caretaker chairmen, state health officials and primary healthcare coordinators in the 18 council areas. The meeting was held at the Cocoa Conference Hall of the governor's office in Akure.

Adegbenro said burial for all sudden deaths must henceforth be supervised by medical experts to prevent possible spread of Lassa fever, that has so far claimed 6 lives with 27 recorded cases.

Also speaking at the meeting, the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Lola Fagbemi, said funds would be released for advocacy and awareness campaign to end Lassa fever in the state.

[Cases of Lassa fever in Nigeria continue to increase. In Lassa fever endemic areas of Nigeria, the current 6-month dry season is when most cases occur. One can expect additional cases this year (2018) up through June, and sporadic cases thereafter. Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or its excreta. Rodent control has to be undertaken at the village level with individual households. This requires an extensive and continuous public education effort. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients, as happened with the cases of the 10 health care workers mentioned in the 1st report above. Early in the course of Lassa fever, patients present with a general febrile disease with symptoms common to a variety of infections, including malaria, making it more difficult for healthcare workers to know when personal protective equipment should be used.

The Nigeria NCDC and its EOC (Emergency Operations Centre) are actively dealing with the state health care personnel in the affected states currently.
