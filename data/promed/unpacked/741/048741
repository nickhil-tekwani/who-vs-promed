CDC investigates Legionnaires cases
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Oct. 18: The Centers for Disease Control and the Missouri
health
department are investigating four cases of Legionnaires' disease diagnosed
at St. Louis University Medical Center since late June. Two of the
patients died from the disease, a form of bacterial pneumonia.
Dr. Larry Fields, acting director of the St. Louis health department, says
it could be two to four weeks to determine if the cases are linked. While
the number of cases does not exceed what would be considered normal for the
area, Fields told local news media that the unusual clustering in one
facility over several months led to the decision to ask for help from the
CDC.
