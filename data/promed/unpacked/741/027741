Another case of yellow fever has been confirmed serologically by
Laboratorio Lacen. The victim was 67 years old, a resident Of Santa Fe de
Goias, a few kilometers from Jussara, where another case had been seen
previously. The patient died on 20 Apr 2000, after having onset of fever,
jaundice & vomiting on 13 Apr, exactly 10 days after the vaccination team
passed through the region. He refused vaccination (was quoted as saying he
had never been vaccinated & was not going to start now).
This is the 26th death out of 51 cases infected in the last 12 months in
Goias State. So far, the door-to-door vaccination campaign has reached
61/105 rural municipalities, and is ongoing in 36 more.
