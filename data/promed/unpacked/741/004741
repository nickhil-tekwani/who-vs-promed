Only 5 districts out of 29 in Sindh have not yet reported a single case of lumpy skin disease (LSD) that has so far killed 250 cows. Its outbreak in Karachi got aggravated due to misuse of live virus vaccines.

This was stated by the provincial livestock director general during a question-answer session at a seminar organised by the Association of Molecular and Microbial Sciences at Dow International Medical College, Ojha campus, on Thursday [24 Mar 2022].

Explaining how LSD spread in cattle in the city, livestock DG Dr Nazeer Kalhoro said dairy farmers, out of despair, made an indiscriminate use of live virus vaccines apparently without consulting a qualified veterinarian. These LSD vaccines were reportedly smuggled in from South Africa.

Live virus vaccines carry risks and should be used with caution. "Most dairy farmers in Karachi had a few infected animals with signs of the disease which led them to believe that the rest of their herd was safe and could be vaccinated. However, this was not the case," he noted.

Their other animals, Dr Kalhoro pointed out, were also infected but were not showing signs either due to their good immune system or because the virus was yet to complete its incubation period. These animals also developed full-blown disease when the live virus in the vaccine got combined with the pathogen already present in their bodies.

He claimed that the disease outbreak situation improved particularly in Cattle Colony when farmers heeded to government's advice and stopped using live virus vaccines. [Only live virus vaccines against LSD are commercially available; see comments. - Mod.AS].

Currently, the livestock staff was administering goat pox vaccine (to affected animals), which provided 40 to 50% protection against LSD.

Asked about the LSD vaccine the government has planned to import, he said a total of 4 million vaccine doses would be imported from Turkey and would be administered free of cost to only healthy animals in Sindh.

"We have made plans to vaccinate 2 million animals in the 1st phase and start production of local LSD vaccine within 8 to 9 months. So far, 28 857 cows have been infected in Sindh whereas 13 000 animals have recovered," he said, adding that the cured animals had developed life-long immunity against the disease.

Dr Kalhoro regretted the propaganda on LSD in the social media, clarifying that the disease had been there for a century but no case of LSD transmission from animal to human had been reported in science literature.

"This disease only affects cows and the infected animals experience a sudden and significant drop in milk production. Hence, there is no question of milk getting contaminated while there is no evidence that the disease affects [the quality of] milk or meat."

[As of today, only live attenuated strains of capripoxvirus have been used as vaccines specifically for the control of LSD; no other vaccines are currently commercially available. A list of the 11 most commonly used vaccines registered for use in cattle against LSD, globally (links accessed on 22 Sep 2021) is presented in Table 1 of a recent review paper (Ref 1).

Capripoxviruses are cross-reactive within the genus. Consequently, it is possible to protect cattle against LSD using strains of capripoxvirus derived from sheep or goats. However, it is recommended to carry out controlled trials, using the most susceptible breeds, prior to introducing a vaccine strain not usually used in cattle. For example, the application of live modified Kenyan sheep and goat pox vaccine strain (SGP0240) in milking dairy cattle (Holstein), in Israel, reportedly caused deleterious post-vaccination reactions (sharp milk-yield drop and mild, though temporary, LSD-like lesions).

According to a 2021 published comparative evaluation of 5 commercially available LSD virus-based live attenuated vaccines (Ref 2), application of such vaccines could sometimes be followed by the appearance of lump-like structures on the animals. These nodules were similar to those seen after challenge but clearly smaller. They developed into small skin lesions with scab formation; however, complete healing was seen in 1 to 2 weeks. This type of post-vaccination reaction has been referred to as a Neethling response (Neethling is a South African capripox vaccine strain, used for decades).

Following challenge, 2 types of nodules were observed by the authors of the said assessment:
(1) lump-like structures which developed during the course of the experiment into skin lesions with scab formation and remained visible until necropsy. This type of nodule was referred to as a permanent nodule;
(2) lump-like structures which were indistinguishable from the permanent nodules but disappeared after a few days without the formation of skin lesions or scabs -- this type of nodule was referred to as a temporary nodule.

The duration of protection provided by LSD vaccination is unknown. This information, and some of the above, is included in OIE's Terestrial Manual LSD chapter at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.04.12_LSD.pdf (version adopted May 2021).
