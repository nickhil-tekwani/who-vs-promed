Some 4800 animals in the regions of Vallée-des-Prêtres, Cité La Cure, and Vallée Pitot have been vaccinated against foot and mouth disease (FMD) as at 28 Aug 2016, in collaboration with private veterinarians. In a bid to control the spread of the disease, the Ministry of Agro-Industry and Food Security has imported 10 000 doses of vaccines from Botswana.

According to the Ministry of Agro-Industry and Food Security, veterinarians have also been visiting the following regions: Belle-Mare, Salazie, Nouvelle Découverte, Triolet, Goodlands, Terre-Rouge, Pailles, Highlands, Le Bouchon, Pamplemousses, Cap Malheureux, Triolet, and Petite-Rivière. Some 82 pigs belonging to illegal breeders at Cité La Cure were culled yesterday [28 Aug 2016]. In the wake of the outbreak of the disease a total of 1111 animals, comprising ox/cows, goats, sheep, and pigs have been culled so far.

FMD is a highly contagious animal disease that has large socioeconomic impacts. In this context, the government has agreed to provide Rs 35 million [about USD 1 million] to compensate farmers for their slaughtered animals. Thus, breeders will get Rs 35 000 [about USD 1000] for each slaughtered ox/cow, Rs 6000 [about USD 170] for each goat or sheep, and Rs 5000 [about USD 141] for each pig.

The disease was first detected in Mauritius in early August [2016] and following the detection, a crisis committee was set up with a view to better monitoring of the situation. The committee comprised representatives of the Ministry; the Food and Agricultural Research and Extension Institute; the Ministry of Environment, Sustainable Development, and Disaster and Beach Management; the Ministry of Local Government; the Police Department as well as the Chamber of Agriculture and the Mauritius Meat Producers Association.

The vaccination campaign against FMD kicked off on 22 Aug 2016.

[The following firsthand interesting information, pertaining to the diagnosis of the outbreak described and useful commentary, was included in the introduction to the monthly "Global FMD Situation Report" of EuFMD (European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease) for July 2016, published 26 Aug 2016. The introduction is authored by the guest editor of the monthly report, Stéphan Zientara, Anses, Animal health laboratory, Maisons-Alfort, France. (http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/docs/FMD_monthly_reports/2016/July2016.pdf).

"I wish to draw your attention to 2 particular outbreaks in this report: the FMDV outbreak on the Island of Rodrigues and the one on the Mauritius Island (2 islands separated by 350 miles [563 km]) and located in the Indian Ocean.

"As indicated in this report, FMD broke out on [7 Jul 2016] on the Island of Rodrigues. Beginning of August [2016], FMD-like clinical signs were detected in Mauritius after importing cattle from Rodrigues. The 1st laboratory results were based only on serology (and only against some serotypes). Another set of samples were sent to my lab in Maisons-Alfort. The samples were received [11 Aug 2016] late in the afternoon. On [12 Aug 2016] (after RT-PCR, virus isolation and antigen detection ELISA carried out on the cell-culture viral isolate and VP1 sequencing -- and thanks to the efficacy of Dr Labib Bakkali-Kassimi's team), the serotype was determined as serotype O).

"This Rodrigues/Mauritius event is interesting firstly because it represents the occurrence of FMD in islands which were supposed to be quite isolated and at low risk of FMD; secondly, it illustrates the necessity of rapidly performing laboratory analysis to confirm (or not) FMD even in areas supposed at low-risk of emergence; thirdly, it illustrates a difference of delay between the detection of an event in the field (few weeks) and the delay of the competent laboratory to give a diagnosis (about 24h); finally, the absolute necessity to know the serotype present in the field before using FMD vaccines."

The results of the Mauritian FMDV O strain's genotyping, including data on closely-related strains from elsewhere, are anticipated. -Mod.AS
