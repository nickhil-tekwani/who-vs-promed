Outbreak of Cryptosporidiosis in Cardiff Wales
---------------------------------------
Public Health Wales and Environmental Health Officers from Cardiff County Council are investigating several cases of diarrhoeal illness in 6th formers from The Bishop of Llandaff Church in Wales High School, Cardiff.

One case has been confirmed with cryptosporidiosis and a further 4 cases are under investigation. The illness has been reported in 6th formers who attended a school trip over the Easter holidays.

Symptoms of cryptosporidiosis include watery diarrhoea, stomach cramps, vomiting and a slight temperature. Symptoms usually appear within 5 to 7 days following infection.

Dr Gwen Lowe, Consultant in Communicable Disease Control for Public Health Wales said: "Following a recent school trip we have been notified of several 6th formers who have been experiencing diarrhoeal symptoms with one case confirmed as cryptosporidium. "Most people with cryptosporidium will recover without treatment, but in individuals with severely weakened immune systems, a more serious illness
may develop. "We are encouraging everyone to observe good hand hygiene precautions to
limit the spread of disease. "People are advised to wash their hands with liquid soap and dry them thoroughly after going to the toilet and before preparing or eating food."

Anyone who is unwell with gastrointestinal symptoms is advised to contact their GP or NHS Direct on 0845 46 47. People who are unwell with vomiting or diarrhoea should not return to work or school for 48 hours after their symptoms have stopped.
