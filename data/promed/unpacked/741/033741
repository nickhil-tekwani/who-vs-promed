The [Ugandan] Ministry of Health will declare Luwero district to be Ebola-free on 16 Jan 2013 if no new cases are registered in the area, Permanent Secretary Asuman Lukwago has said. The declaration will follow the completion of the 42 days countdown period since the last patient was discharged from the Isolation Centre. It comes at a time when the Ministry has just declared Kabale and Ibanda free of Marburg virus disease.

The countdown period is a prerequisite of the World Health Organization requiring any affected country to monitor the situation for 42 days before finally declaring an end to an outbreak. Lukwago said the declaration will be made in [respect of] Luwero alone. "Due to the [sporadic nature] of the outbreaks we have decided to declare district by district free from outbreaks meaning that if Luwero is declared free of Ebola virus disease, [the declaration applies to that district only]".

"But we will continue to urge Ugandans to be alert and inform us of anybody with symptoms so that our system can quickly identify any person with the disease," Lukwago added.

The Permanent Secretary said his Ministry is working with the Environment and Wildlife Ministries to ensure that animals and birds that spread both Ebola and Marburg virus disease are wiped out. "Our experts are telling us that these diseases, Marburg and Ebola virus diseases, could be carried by some special birds and animals which have been cited in some mines and caves in some parts of mid-western Uganda, especially Kamwenge. He stressed that they were working with these Ministries to wipe out the affected birds and animals as they carry out research on the diseases and how they are [spread by] birds and animals.

Ebola and Marburg virus diseases are both highly infectious disease, spread mostly through contact with the body fluids [of patients], and have high case fatalities. Symptoms include bleeding, diarrhea, and vomiting and while there is no cure for either, some patients survive through treatment of symptoms.

A total of 3 people died from the recent outbreak of Ebola virus disease and 2 of the dead were from one family in Luwero district, about 75 kilometers [47 mi] North of Kampala. This new outbreak came just weeks after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Uganda Ebola virus disease free. The Ebola outbreak was confirmed following laboratory tests that turned out positive.

[It is presumed that this declaration will be confirmed by the WHO in due course. It is good news that soon it will be 42 days since discharge of the last Ebola virus disease patient, and that Luwero district can be declared free of Ebola virus disease. Unidentified birds and animals are considered to be the source of the outbreak, but so far there has been no direct identification of any specific avian or animal source of the disease.

The location of Luwero District can be found in the map of the Districts of Uganda (no. 48 in the Central Region) at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Uganda. A HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/r/45B0. - Mod.CP]
