Dear Colleagues,

The international nature of ProMED-mail is both remarkable and central to its core. On any given day, a reader might encounter infectious disease news from half a dozen countries around the globe. In the last few days, I've seen posts from India (avian influenza), Australia (legionellosis), South Korea (foot-and-mouth disease), Sudan (yellow fever), North America (white nose syndrome), and Brazil (an undiagnosed respiratory disease).

Could my patient, recently returned from Melbourne and complaining of cough, fever, and chills have something other than influenza? ProMED builds a worldwide community for the sharing of information and resources and the communication of ideas. ProMED is a vital source of reliable information reaching the international infectious disease community in every country on the planet. Local language editions of ProMED are published with news and topics relevant to the public health communities in Portuguese- and Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America, in Francophone Africa, in Anglophone Africa, in the Mekong Basin, and in the Russian-speaking independent states of the former Soviet Union. The spirit of cooperation, of transcending ideologies and borders that embodies ProMED is what makes participating in this community so rewarding. This is important to me.

No other information resource brings you the accurate, relevant, and timely emerging infectious disease reporting that ProMED provides multiple times each day. Covering the entire One Health spectrum of human, animal, and crop plant diseases, ProMED brings you news and expert interpretation that places data in context. No other news source keeps you so well informed on topics you need and want to know about. No other publication, online or in print, covers the topic of infectious diseases so broadly, deeply, and internationally. Only ProMED builds and maintains the links among infectious disease experts around the world that are so vital to thoughtful analysis, rapid action, and coordinated response.

I make an annual financial contribution because ProMED provides me with the daily information I need both for my work in public health and as an infectious disease practitioner, but more importantly, ProMED provides me with a connection to my peers around the world. I believe that this international community is important.

Please join with me in keeping ProMED-mail, the hub of this community, financially healthy. Please contribute generously.
