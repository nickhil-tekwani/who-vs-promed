I don't normally respond to things, but your [CHC's posting and
editorialising on the recent death of a woman from lyssavirus was a tad
over the top. The health officers in Queensland have been making
themselves available and open to the press. I suggest that the 'kooks'
that contacted you may well be members of the press trying to find a
different angle with which to sensationalise this tragedy even further.
My understanding is that yesterday the Qld Health Department and the family
of the dead woman issued a joint statement. Following her bite the woman
reported to her local GP who offered tetanus vaccination. Following the
report of her bite to authorities, the health department sent the
appropriate vaccine to her GP who offered the woman the appropriate course
but which [she declined. I'm sure that Qld Health will be happy to supply
you with a copy of the media release.

[While I was not editorializing in the sad death of the recent Ballina
virus patient, I was commenting on the details of taxonomy, nomenclature,
laboratory diagnosis, and the interpretations of sequence comparisons.
It is not the Queensland health officials who have been uncooperative at
all; indeed, they have been quite cooperative and communicative. For one
of many examples, see #4 below.
The "kooks" (U.S. slang for odd person) I mentioned as having called me
were not reporters looking for a different side to the story. The latter
identified themselves and were not only polite but provided me with some
recent rumors (which we did not post). Those I classified as "kooks" were
those who ranted and raved about Australian Government cover-ups,
Australian military involvement, bloated Australian Government budgets,
etc. I put them on the speaker phone and went for a snack.
In my (CHC's) view, one could scarcely sensationalize these biological
findings any more than nature has already done. These are a remarkable
chain of events and discoveries, many of which should teach us a great deal
about rabies and rabies-related viruses. There are always articles written
by free lance writers who want to see their deathless prose in print (it's
how they make a living) but which not only contribute nothing to the
dialogue or to public education but are inflammatory and incorrect as well.
It may be that if the public, including the unfortunate patient, was more
well-educated, the patient would still be alive. My point, perhaps
unclearly stated, and for which I apologize, is that public health
personnel are responsible for not making preliminary or misleading
statements and for being as open and above board as their supervisors will
allow. There's the rub! I know of no country where absolute and complete
honesty is the norm. This, of course, may lead to reelection but not to
correct public perception.
Here's an example: The multiple and confusing names for this Australian
bat lyssavirus are clearly meant to obfuscate the fact of the existence of
autochthonous rabies in Australia. - Mod.CHC

I am astonished by some of the comments made by moderator CHC in the recent
issue V.98 n.175. In particular, his/her tongue lashing of David Dawson was
patronizing, arrogant, prissy and immature. Such responses are hardly
likely to encourage the dialogue I assume you are trying to promote.

[It's "his". Patronizing? No. Prissy? Certainly not. Arrogant and
immature? Possibly. Never mind all this, let me know when I am "wrong".
In my regard for the environment I consider myself more akin to Edward
Abbey than to people who believe (or say they believe) God gave us this
planet to do with it what we will. I was less criticizing David Dawson
himself than his views and the views of certain others regarding flying
foxes. We have absolutely no idea what we are doing to our environment
when we dump sewage into the "endless" ocean, leave heaps of slag on the
surface after mining, heat plastic containers in microwave ovens, or
unnaturally wipe out a species; see Hugh Spencer's comments in #3 below.
When you see a comment by "CHC" at the end of a ProMED-mail message, you
know it is from me, not from ProMED-mail. I am absolutely certain that
many of my views are presented in an undiplomatic fashion, that what I say
is unacceptable to many, and that the people who support ProMED-mail are
probably biting their lips some of the time. Much to their credit, they do
not attempt to censor me. There are those who see my sometimes bizarre and
often irreverent sense of humor as a plus ("lightens things up a bit"),
others as a minus ("not sufficiently serious about serious matters"). I
shall ignore them all until the telephone rings with the call saying I have
overstepped the bounds of propriety and that my services are no longer
needed. Until then I will continue to speak out against an anthropocentric
view of this remarkable planet. - Mod.CHC

From: Hugh Spencer <Hugh@austrop.org.au>

At the risk of continuing the "string" too long, I should like to add three
issues.
1) Despite the incredible divergence views of the pro- and anti- ff
[flying fox members of our population, flying foxes are regarded as
keystone species in that they are critical for the pollination and
distribution of a variety of native plants. Two of the four species found
in Australia are considered to be somewhat endangered due to loss of
habitat and the depredations of farmers. There has been a historical
tradition of intolerance to these animals, stemming from mind-numbing
ignorance about their biology and habits.
2) Lyssa (Ballina) virus has from all indications been present in the
flying fox population, probably since they have been in this country, if
not before. The real frequency of occurrence in the population of
lyssavirus is probably substantially lower than 1/1000, judging by the
paucity of infected animals found, compared with the population of animals.
The recent death was the first death in Australia from [this lyssavirus
derived from a flying fox (mega-bat), the earlier death from [this
lyssavirus was from a micro-bat's (unrelated group of animals) bite.
3) There is a particularly irresponsible article published in the Dec.5 New
Scientist, called "Bats out of Hell" which implies that flying-foxes are
the possible vectors of a range of nasties from Ebola to Japanese
Encephalitis, to say nothing of lyssa. Articles such as this do nothing for
reasoned analysis and research, and set the flying fox conservation
programs back by years.

From: Greg Smith <smithga@health.qld.gov.au>

I've been asked by a few people to provide a laboratory update on the
recent fatal human lyssavirus case in Australia following a request by
Charlie in ProMED-mail. I've already sent a posting so if you have received
those please ignore this message. I've been told I might have sent the
reply incorrectly. Saliva, CSF and serum samples collected three days
after admission to hospital were submitted to the Public Health Virology
laboratory of Queensland Health Pathology and Scientific Services for
testing. Serum was antibody negative on a commercial ELISA test for
antibody to rabies virus. IFT staining of cells collected by
centrifugation of the saliva was inconclusive. The saliva and CSF were put
up for virus culture on murine neuroblastoma cells (MNA). RNA was extracted
from both samples (as well as from serum) and was examined using a
hemi-nested PCR approach.
A positive PCR result was obtained in both first and second round
reactions for the saliva only, both CSF and serum were negative. A second
extraction and PCR was performed to confirm this result. Both Southern
blotting (using a Dig labelled PCR product) and DNA sequencing confirmed
the PCR product as being a lyssavirus specific amplicon. A positive PCR
product was subsequently also obtained from RNA extracted from a nuchal
biopsy.
Preliminary sequence analysis of both the saliva and nuchal biopsy PCR
products indicates that the virus is very similar to flying fox isolates
previously isolated in this laboratory and clearly distinct from a
yellow-bellied sheath tailed bat virus also isolated in this laboratory.
The nucleotide sequence of the 'human virus' varied by four nucleotides
(from approx 450 bp) from that of the three flying fox isolates previously
isolated and handled in our laboratory.
72 hour [post-infection examination of MNA cells which had been inoculated
with saliva were IFT negative but PCR positive. MNA cells inoculated at the
same time with CSF and serum were both IFT and PCR negative. We are hopeful
of an IFT-confirmed virus isolate in the next couple of days. Additional
CSF, serum and saliva samples collected two to three days later have
produced similar results, CSF and serum were both antibody and PCR negative
while the saliva was again PCR positive. Autopsy samples were IFT positive.
CSF, brain, adrenals and saliva are on for virus isolation in MNA cells.
We hope to have sequencing results of the 5,000-odd bp region extending
from the start of the N protein to the end of the polymerase gene available
in the next couple of weeks. This should allow direct comparison to the
nucleotide sequence of the Ballina virus recently published by Gould and
his colleagues from the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL).
We will also be forwarding the virus on to Harvey Westbury, Ross Lunt and
colleagues of the WHO reference laboratory at AAHL.
