Shrimp farmers in the coastal provinces of the Cuu Long (Mekong)
Delta have seen stocks decimated by the worst outbreak of disease in
the sector's history.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development's
Animal Health Department, more than 53 000 ha [131 000 acres] of
shrimp farms in 7 Cuu Long (Mekong) Delta provinces -- Soc Trang, Bac
Lieu, Ca Mau, Tien Giang, Ben Tre, Tra Vinh, and Kien Giang -- have
seen a huge number of shrimp deaths from an unidentified liver
disease, with losses estimated at VND 1 trillion (USD 47.6 million).

Shrimp deaths in the Mekong Delta account for 98 per cent of all
losses from the disease in the country.

However, officials from the department have said losses could be much
more than what was reported. The shrimp that died were between 20 and
30 days old.

Soc Trang Province has been the hardest-hit, with more than 19 000
[47 000 acres] of 25 000 ha [62 000 acres] of shrimp farms affected.
Following was Bac Lieu with 8600 ha [21 300 acres] and Tra Vinh, 6600
ha [16 300 acres].

Last weekend [4-5 Jun 2011], Minister of Agriculture and Rural
Development Cao Duc Phat visited the provinces and chaired an urgent
meeting with local authorities to discuss solutions to reduce losses.

Nguyen Trung Hieu, Soc Trang Province's People's Committee, said all
of the shrimp bred at the locality's Tran De and Vinh Chau districts
died.

According to Nguyen Van Hao of the ministry, the outbreak of the
disease began last July [2010]. Hao said the source of the disease
could be water-borne.

Minister Cao Duc Phat urged the ministry's Science Department to
intensify inspections and ordered provincial governments to create a
map identifying the affected areas that should be treated.

The minister said recent solutions carried out in the localities to
curb down the epidemic were not strong enough and needed further
co-ordination between branches. Plans to help farmers to resume their
production should be carried out soon.

Experts said they would work with the Pasteur Institute to determine
the causes of the outbreak and that samples would be sent to Arizona,
the US, for tests.

Dr Phan Thu Oanh, deputy director of Bac Lieu Province's Department
of Agriculture and Rural Development, said it was vital to find a way
of preventing the epidemic from recurring but that in the meantime,
funds need to be raised to help farmers get back on their feet.

Province's Vinh Chau District, said her losses from the epidemic
amounted to about VND 500 million (USD 23 800).

[Microsporidia tend to affect striated muscles. This article mentions
the liver of the shrimp. This outbreak may no longer be about
microsporidia, but rather about an evolving disease.

Hopefully the lab in Arizona will be able to elucidate more clearly
the causative agent or the mechanism responsible for the loss of these
shrimp and the livelihood of these people. - Mod.TG
