[Ranaviruses are a group of pathogens belonging to the genus _Ranavirus_ (family Iridoviridae) that have been linked to catastrophic die-offs of larval amphibians in many parts of the world. In the United States, ranaviruses are responsible for the majority of disease-related mortality events in amphibians. It was also found to be the cause of mass die-offs in frogs from the French Alps. This virus became an emerging infectious disease possibly due to a novel strain introduction or increased occurrence of anthropogenic stressors on the landscape. A few years ago, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) listed ranavirus as a notiÔ¨Åable pathogen. - Mod.PMB
