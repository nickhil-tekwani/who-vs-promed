Pink eye outbreak reported in South Georgia
-------------------------------------
Optometrists are urging folks to wash their hands and avoid touching their eyes because they are seeing a rash of very severe pink eye cases. It's gotten so bad that optometrists at South Georgia Eye Partners say last week they saw up to 3 new cases a day per doctor in Valdosta and Tifton. Doctors are reporting similar cases in Ben Hill and Irwin Counties too.

Pink eye [conjunctivitis] is very contagious, and it can easily be passed around especially at schools and daycares. It's extremely important to wash your hands as often as possible and avoid touching your eyes because once you start seeing the symptoms you could be contagious for up to 2 weeks. "These patients eyes get very red almost a beefy red their eyelids are very swollen very painful it looks like the worse pink eye you've ever imagined having," said Dr. Alan Peaslee, Optometrist at South Georgia Eye Partners.

Other ways to avoid getting pink eye, change your towels and wash clothes daily and avoid sharing eye make-up.

[Conjunctivitis [pink eye] caused by allergens is not contagious; however, viral and bacterial conjunctivitis can be easily spread from person to person and can cause epidemics.The risk of getting conjunctivitis or of passing it on to someone else can be reduced by good hygiene. This outbreak in the state of Georgia is attributed to viral infection, but the infectious agent has not been identified.

Viral conjunctivitis can be caused by a number of different viruses, many of which are associated with an upper respiratory tract infection. Viral conjunctivitis is typically mild, with symptoms being the worst on days 3-5 of infection. The condition usually clears up in 7-14 days without treatment and resolves without any long-term effects. Rarely it can take 2-3 weeks or more for viral conjunctivitis to completely clear up, depending on whether complications develop, and the specific virus involved.

Viruses associated with outbreaks of conjunctivitis include adenoviruses (the most common), picornaviruses (enterovirus 70 and coxsackievirus A24), rubella virus, measles virus, herpes simplex virus, varicella virus, Epstein-Barr virus and even on occassions Newcastle disease virus.
