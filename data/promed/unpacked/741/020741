[1] California (Santa Clara County)
Tue 16 Apr 2019
https://paloaltoonline.com/news/2019/04/16/santa-clara-county-confirms-its-fourth-case-of-measles


The USA is on pace to have the worst measles outbreak since 1994, with 555 cases across 20 states since 1 Jan [2019] and 4 confirmed cases in Santa Clara County, public health officials said Tuesday [16 Apr 2019].

Calling it a major public health concern that strains county resources, public health officer Sara Cody said the country is "swimming in measles," including 21 cases in California, 8 of which are in the Bay Area. Unlike places like Brooklyn, which are experiencing localized outbreaks, the 4 cases in Santa Clara County all appear to be "independently imported," meaning likely originated from measles outbreaks elsewhere in the world and not spread within the county.

Unlike past cases, which prompted county health officials to list all of the potential dates, times, and places that residents could have been exposed to measles, the latest confirmed case came with a short statement by the Santa Clara County Public Health Department saying that the public health risk is "very low."

Four cases -- 3 of which were found in adult patients and one in a child under age 18 -- may not seem like much in a county of nearly 2 million residents, but Cody said investigating each case is "incredibly resource intensive" because of the sheer size of the county and the potential for contact with the infection.

The last big uptick in measles was in 2014, when there were 667 cases in the USA over the course of the whole year. At 555 cases as of the 1st week of April [2019], the country is slated to quickly outpace that number.

At a recent county Health and Hospital Committee meeting, Cody said she is "very concerned" about preserving Santa Clara County's high vaccination rates against all preventable diseases, particularly measles because it is so highly contagious. Parents can no longer cite personal belief exemptions to avoid the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine for their children, but some physicians are exploiting a loophole by signing off on fictitious medical exemptions.

"There are some providers, who are known to community [members] who don't want to vaccinate their child, that will sign off on their medical exemption," Cody said.

Although some school districts in Santa Cruz and Marin counties saw a decline in vaccinations in recent years, Mountain View's track record remains solid. Mountain View Whisman School District's MMR vaccination rates fall anywhere from 95% at Castro Elementary School to 99% at Huff Elementary and Crittenden and Graham middle schools, which is consistent with the rate at schools in the Los Altos School District.

Preschools and child-care centers in the city, both public and private, also have MMR vaccination rates in excess of 98%, including the German International School of Silicon Valley, Action Day Primary Plus, the Mountain View Parent Nursery School, and Google's child care center on the former Slater Elementary School campus.

Cody said those rates need to remain high in order to protect the small population that can't be vaccinated for a medical reason, particularly infants who don't get their 1st shot of the MMR vaccine until they are a year old.

"If the people around them are not vaccinated, they can't be protected," she said. "The only way to protect your baby from becoming really ill from measles is to ensure everyone in contact with your baby gets vaccinated."

The Bay Area has seen 4 other cases of measles outside of Santa Clara County: 1 in San Francisco, 2 in San Mateo County, and 1 in Santa Cruz County, according to the state Department of Public Health.

Information about measles is available on the Santa Clara County's website.

https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemlee/measles-google-headquarters-mountain-view


In the midst of a historic US measles outbreak, at least one Google employee walking around the tech giant's main Silicon Valley campus has been diagnosed.

As Google fights criticism that it has let anti-vaccine disinformation flourish on its platform, the tech giant's Silicon Valley campus, where thousands work, is now confronting its own in-house case of measles as the virus resurges across the USA.

In an email sent to some employees last week [week of Mon 8 Apr 2019] and obtained by BuzzFeed News, a staff doctor at Google wrote that a worker who had recently been in one of its Mountain View, California, buildings had been diagnosed with measles.

"We have been working with the Santa Clara County Public Health Department, and they would like us to share this measles advisory, which contains information on measles, exposure risks, and actions to be taken," Kaye wrote 13 Apr [2019], adding that "this note is just a precaution." Neither Kaye nor Google immediately responded to requests for comment.

In Santa Clara County, which includes Mountain View, there are 4 confirmed cases of measles, public health officials said Tuesday [16 Apr 2019].

In 2015, Wired reported that one daycare at Google had a 68% measles vaccination rate, although Google contested the accuracy of the article at the time.

Here is the email from Google occupational medicine physician David Kaye to some employees on [Sat 13 Apr 2019]:

Dear all,

This note is just a precaution. A Googler who was in the office in Charleston, [South Carolina], on [Thu 4 Apr 2019], has been diagnosed with measles.

We have been working with the Santa Clara County Public Health Department, and they would like us to share this measles advisory, which contains information on measles, exposure risks, and actions to be taken. More information (including a list of frequently asked questions) can be found on the CDC's page on measles.

If you have any additional concerns, or have specific questions about your health, please contact your primary care provider. If you learn that you have a confirmed case of measles, please let us know at go/illness.

The measles outbreak is now rapidly spreading beyond New York, where it was most concentrated. State officials have now identified the cause of 39 cases in Michigan: a single traveler. [Washington Post / Lena H. Sun]

The traveler, who comes from Israel, was visiting the USA as part of a fundraising tour in Orthodox Jewish communities. Prior to visiting Michigan, he had spent time in New York. [Detroit Metro Times / Steve Neavling]

The traveler was unaware of his condition because he was misdiagnosed the 1st time. The doctor overseeing him wrote off his fever and cough as bronchitis, and only later -- after the traveler had already been to multiple synagogues, homes, and kosher markets -- did he realize measles might be the culprit. [Detroit Free Press / Kristen Jordan Shamus]

This case is an example of how contagious the disease is and how quickly it's spreading across the USA. So far, there have been 555 reports of measles in 20 states, with 90 new cases surfacing this week [week of Mon 15 Apr 2019] alone. [Vox / Julia Belluz]

Low vaccination rates in ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities are one of the key reasons for the massive resurgence of measles. With Passover just around the corner, government officials are hoping to get more people vaccinated so that the disease does not continue to travel. [USA Today / John Bacon]

Michigan shows that religious communities and government officials can work closely together to combat the outbreak. Rabbinical leaders have helped the health department set up clinics and have vaccinated more than 2000 people as of early April [2019]. [Washington Post / Lena H. Sun]

The state health department added another reported case in Oakland County to the list Wednesday afternoon [17 Apr 2019]. While there is an additional measles case to report, there are not any new exposure spots, as of now.

Michigan's current measles outbreak continues to trend in the wrong direction, with the state health department reporting 42 cases as of Wednesday morning, [17 Apr 2019].

While the 2 new cases added to the list come in previously affected Wayne and Oakland counties, one of the cases is linked to exposure spots in Kent and Ingham counties.

The Department of Health and Human Services reports in a news release that the outbreak has caused 39 cases in Oakland County, 2 in Wayne County, including one in Detroit, and one in Washtenaw County.

The Maryland Department of Health says it confirmed a 3rd measles case in a Maryland resident, Reuters reported on Wednesday [17 Apr 2019].

Since March [2019], more than 15 people in Oakland County, Michigan, were confirmed as suffering from measles following a person visiting the USA from Israel.

New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority is currently investigating a complaint by a Haredi Orthodox man, who alleges that a bus driver refused to stop for him at a Brooklyn bus stop over the current measles outbreak.

Vaccine-preventable diseases are surging in Venezuela, according to new research presented at the 2019 European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases.

Moreover, Venezuela's crumbling healthcare infrastructure is now more typical of a "conflict zone." As an example, emigrating individuals with infectious diseases may be unknowingly causing a spillover of diseases beyond Venezuela's boundaries.

In Venezuela, the circulation of wild measles, polio, and diphtheria had not been reported in over 10 years.

This new study provides new data on the ongoing epidemics of measles and diphtheria in the Americas.

Measles cases from Venezuela have been reported in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. The report provides data taken over a 16-month period (June 2017-October 2018), during which time a total of 7524 suspected measles cases have been reported in Venezuela. Of these, 5525 were confirmed, representing 68% (5525/8091) of measles cases in the Americas reported, and also the most deaths from measles (73/85).

These authors said in a press release, "The current reality in Venezuela is a conflux of plummeting vaccination coverages and ongoing outbreaks of other vaccine-preventable diseases."

To alert international travelers to Venezuela's health crisis, the USA, Canada, and the UK governments have issued level 4 travel advisories that advise against visiting Venezuela.

Additionally, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a level 3 travel alert on 15 May 2019, which identifies various diseases a visitor to Venezuela should be protected from with vaccines or medications.

The study is by Dr. Adriana Tami (University Medical Center Groningen, Netherlands, and University of Carabobo, Venezuela) and Dr. Alberto Paniz-Mondolfi (IDB Biomedical Research Institute, Barquisimeto, Venezuela), and colleagues.

These researchers conclude by saying, "Failure of timely action may bring a tsunami of new cases, not only in Venezuela but also in other countries in the Americas."

The authors note that, since October 2014, there is a dire shortage of official epidemiological information in Venezuela; thus, they did an active search of published and unpublished data. Data from the Americas were sourced from PAHO and from Venezuelan Health Observatory. Brazilian and Colombian data were accessed via their respective Ministries of Health.

[7] Israel: flight attendant
Date: Wed 17 Apr 2019
Source: CNN [edited]
https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/17/health/measles-israel-flight-attendant/index.html


An Israeli flight attendant has slipped into a coma after contracting measles, according to health officials. The 43-year-old woman has encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain, a well-known and potentially deadly complication of the virus. She was otherwise healthy before getting measles.

"She's been in a deep coma for 10 days, and we're now just hoping for the best," said Dr. Itamar Grotto, associate director general of Israel's Ministry of Health.

The flight attendant, who works for El Al, the Israeli national airline, might have contracted the virus in New York, in Israel, or on a flight between the 2, Grotto said. Health authorities do not believe that she spread the virus to anyone on the flights.

She's unable to breathe on her own and is on a respirator in the intensive care unit at Meir Medical Center in Kfar Saba, near Tel Aviv. She developed a fever on 31 Mar [2019] and entered the hospital that same day.

Ongoing measles outbreaks in the USA and Israel started with parents who've chosen not to vaccinate their children, according to health authorities. Authorities believe that the flight attendant was vaccinated as a child, but the vaccine isn't perfect, and in her case, it didn't work.

"I knew this was going to happen sooner or later," said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University and an adviser to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccines. "We have the reintroduction of a serious viral infection with a population that's withholding the vaccine from their children, and now it's spreading beyond that population."

Like many others of her generation around the world, the flight attendant, who has not been identified, received only one dose of the measles vaccine when she was a child.

It wasn't discovered until later that one dose is only about 93% effective. More recently -- in the USA, starting in 1989 -- children have been given 2 doses, which is about 97% effective, according to the CDC.

It's not known why most people who get measles recover fully while others have devastating complications.

About one out of every 1000 children who gets measles will develop encephalitis, according to the CDC. This can lead to convulsions and leave a child deaf or with an intellectual disability.

Additionally, one or 2 out of 1000 US children who get measles will die from it. Worldwide, the illness is fatal in one or 2 out of every 100 children.

No fatalities have been reported in the USA from measles this year [2019] or last year [2018]. In Israel, a toddler and an elderly woman died last year [2018] of the disease. In the European Union, 35 people died of the disease in 2018, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

There have been 3920 cases of measles in Israel from March 2018 through 11 Apr [2019], said Grotto, who is also a professor of epidemiology and public health at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.

In the USA, there have been fewer than 1000 cases in about the same time period.

In Europe, there were 34 383 cases of measles based on data reported to the World Health Organization from April of last year [2018] to April of this year [2019].

Ukraine had the highest number of cases in the past 12 months, with more than 72 000, followed by Madagascar and India with more than 69 000 and 60 000 cases, respectively. WHO warned that there are delays in reporting and that this data may be incomplete.

Grotto said there was a surge of cases in Israel last fall [2018] when large numbers of ultra-Orthodox Israelis traveled to Ukraine on a religious pilgrimage during the Jewish New Year. Ukraine has had more than 72 000 measles cases this year [2019], more than any other country, according to the World Health Organization.

About 85% to 90% of Israeli measles cases have been among ultra-Orthodox Jews, Grotto said.

There's nothing in Judaism that teaches against vaccination; on the contrary, rabbis encourage vaccination in keeping with Jewish teachings on protecting your health and the health of others.

Ultra-Orthodox Jews tend to have large families, and Grotto said those who don't vaccinate tend to have practical, not ideological, reasons. "Sometimes, they vaccinate their 1st or 2nd child, but with so many children, they don't always have time to vaccinate them all," he said. "They're not against vaccines. They have nothing against them ideologically."

To turn the tide in the outbreak, Israeli public health authorities have increased vaccine clinic hours, opened mobile clinics in religious neighborhoods and taken out ads in newspapers in religious communities.

[8] Israel: 2 million unvaccinated or partially vaccinated
Date: Wed 17 Apr 2019
Source: Jerusalem Post [abridged, edited]
https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Two-million-Israelis-unvaccinated-Health-Ministry-helpless-587065


More than 2 million Israelis [population 8.2 million] are either unvaccinated or only partially vaccinated for the measles, according to a Channel 13 report.

An outbreak of the measles has been worrying Israelis for months as it spread throughout the country, as well as in the rest of the world. But Israeli media reports on Tuesday night [16 Apr 2019] exposed the severity of the situation and the difficulty in solving the crisis.

The Health Ministry claims that it has only 115 000 doses of measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine available and 100 000 additional doses of the MMRV vaccine, which combines the diminished measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine with the addition of chickenpox vaccine, according to Channel 13.

State comptroller Yosef Shapira has considered examining the Health Ministry's handling of the recent measles outbreak, according to a report released in January [2019].

The comptroller's office contacted infectious disease and public health experts and is working on compiling data about past efforts regarding the measles outbreak, examining if they were sufficient. However, no formal decision has been made so far over the next steps to take in combating the outbreak.

The ministry released a statement in the past warning the general public about the dangers of measles, including that one out of every 10 patients requires hospitalization after contracting the virus. Nearly 3% of hospitalized patients also have encountered issues with pneumonia. According to data presented at that time, 3 have contracted meningitis, and 2 measles cases resulted in fatalities.

The ministry has been facing intense criticism for its "ineffective" efforts in containing the outbreak. Critics cite the delayed start of vaccination efforts in the Jerusalem area, the city with the largest amount of unvaccinated people. Moreover, those born between 1957 and 1977 only received one dose of the measles vaccine and are only partially protected.

For years, the ministry has also not taken action against doctors who distributed false information about vaccines and has not worked to exhort the public to vaccinate their children. Finally, critics mentioned the lack of government support for Tipat Halav (early childhood clinics), where most infants receive their 1st vaccinations.

The measles surfaced due to the failure of thousands of parents to vaccinate themselves or their children, particularly among the Haredi (ultra-Orthodox) communities in Jerusalem, according to Health Ministry officials. Community leaders and rabbis in recent months have sent mobile units to entire neighborhoods to vaccinate citizens living in the affected areas.

Several members of Knesset have reacted to the outbreak in the past.

The Health Ministry has since shown their inability to contain the outbreak within Israel's affected communities, and at the moment, there have been 2000 reported cases of Israelis who have contracted measles during the last few months, according to Israel Hayom.

The Health Ministry has not held any informational seminars to encourage these parents to immunize their children, and even though the Health Ministry offers to pay for these services, the parents still decline them just the same, according to Israel Hayom.

https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/measles-cases-in-bay-plenty-rise-six


There have now been 6 cases of measles reported in the Bay of Plenty region in the past month, up one since Friday [12 Apr 2019].

The new case, reported last night [Mon 15 Apr 2019], is linked to a previous case in the Mount Maunganui area, Dr Neil de Wet, medical officer of health for Toi Te Ora Public Health, says in a statement. He urged parents to ensure their children receive their free routine MMR immunisations on time, at 15 months and 4 years of age.

"If, for any reason, you have never had a dose of MMR vaccine, now is the time to get one," says Dr de Wet. "After just one dose of MMR vaccine, about 95% of people will be protected from measles, and 99% of people who have had both MMR doses will be protected from measles."

However, people born before January 1969 are likely to be immune and do not need measles immunisation. Dr de Wet says it is particularly important to check your immunity before going on an overseas trip. There are currently significant measles outbreaks worldwide, and he says it's common for travellers to bring the disease back from overseas.

There have also been measles outbreaks in Christchurch and Auckland, which have seen a combined total of around 50 cases.

[10] Worldwide increase due to travel
Date: Wed 17 Apr 2019

https://protect2.fireeye.com/url?k=a7a0b600-fb86825b-a7a24f35-000babd905ee-7d4201339b252628&u=http://www.mygc.com.au/measles-cases-up-300/


We're a little over 3 months into 2019, and we've clocked over a new milestone already, with the number of measles cases globally having increased by a staggering 300%. The World Health Organisation (WHO) confirms that more than 100 000 cases [112 000 cases] have been reported worldwide in 2019 in the 1st 3 months of the year [2019]. In the whole of 2018, only 28 000 cases were logged.

In Australia, we've had 92 cases confirmed in 2019, again, close to the number of cases for the whole of last year [2018].

I must admit, I thought that the big problem here was parents who aren't vaccinating their kids. But, there's another surprising factor at play here.

Yes, these massive figures are partially driven by parents deciding not to vaccinate their kids. And, yes, the reality is that if people don't get their act together and seriously consider the implications of not immunising themselves and their children, we could face a situation where measles quite literally catch on.

However, experts suggest there is another factor driving this rapid increase in measles cases, and it's travelling.

In 2012, a 25-year-old man returned to Australia from Thailand, carrying the virus. This one case led to 167 Australian cases during the 8 months that followed, largely in southwest Sydney.

What a legacy for this poor bloke! His one infection resulted in more than 160 others getting sick. It's clear from this type of story that measles is highly infectious, and we're not talking about an illness that gives you a bit of a rash and a headache, and then you recover.

Associate Professor Anita Heywood from the University of New South Wales, who evaluates immunisation programs and immunisation gaps, says the vaccination movement is having an impact on infection rates in the US, which is important, because this is a global problem.

"Australians travel a lot, and no matter how well we control measles in Australia, if the world isn't controlling it as well, we will always have people coming back with it," she adds.

[11] Pandemic threat
Date: Tue 16 Apr 2019

https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/04/16/measles-outbreak-exposes-future-public-health-vulnerabilities-column/3476073002/


Measles outbreak drains resources we may need for a future epidemic or bioterrorist attack
------------------------------------------
A devastating infectious disease pandemic could kill more people than nuclear war. Just 100 years ago, the Spanish flu killed 50 million to 100 million people. Life-threatening diseases continue to place us at great risk. Ten years ago, it was H1N1 influenza. Today, it is the measles.

Last week [week of Mon 8 Apr 2019], New York Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a public health emergency. Measles outbreaks are occurring in New York City and throughout the nation, with case counts rising at an alarming rate. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports 555 confirmed cases in 20 states so far this year [2019]. It is the 2nd-highest total since measles, which is highly contagious, was declared eliminated in the Americas almost 2 decades ago.

This reemergence of measles teaches us 2 things: 1st, our public health system needs additional resources if it is to control the occurrence and spread of disease throughout the nation. 2nd, since local governments -- including New York City -- are having to spend their limited public health resources to contain diseases like measles, they will not be sufficiently prepared for large-scale biological events, such as a bioterrorist attack or an infectious disease pandemic. If measles draws down New York's resources now, the city will be less able to withstand the next major biological event. Devastation could be vast and swift, followed quickly by an impact on the national economy that we cannot afford.

Entire nation could be vulnerable.
-------------------
In October 2018, the bipartisan Blue-Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, which we co-chair, issued a report called Holding the Line on Biodefense: State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial Reinforcements Needed. We found that basic public health preparedness, detection, response, and recovery infrastructure varies widely throughout the USA, meaning that the entire nation could be at higher risk for biological events. Localities struggling with diseases are immediately vulnerable, but so, too, are those who live in bordering states and close-by territories.

As with any war, we need to get resources and support downrange as quickly as possible to prevent further outbreaks and control the spread of disease. We need a strategy to fight that war, which means the federal government needs to get on with the business of implementing the National Biodefense Strategy that our panel recommended 4 years ago, and which the Trump administration issued last fall [fall 2018].

We need a lot more. We need a new, better-organized, fully funded national EMS system; a better understanding of real-time pharmacy readiness; a stratified hospital system capable of responding to everything from naturally occurring outbreaks to large-scale biological attacks; authorized and fully executed laboratory networks; and increased funding for public health emergency preparedness, response, and recovery. We also need state, local, tribal, territorial, and federal elected officials to make addressing the biological threat before events occur one of their highest priorities.

Don't ignore the lessons diseases teach us
-------------------------
The measles outbreak is particularly troubling, because unlike many other infectious disease threats, there is an effective vaccine for measles. Not only should state and local governments continue to strongly advocate for the use of vaccines, families, individuals, and civic organizations all have essential roles to play in encouraging their use to mitigate the effects of infectious diseases like measles.

We cannot afford to ignore the lessons that measles, Ebola, pandemic influenza, plague, Zika, and other diseases have been teaching us -- and continue to teach us -- about our vulnerabilities. Eventually, those vulnerabilities to biological events could overcome our national ability to respond and recover. Emergency declarations will not be able to help us then. Let's do the work today to effectively prepare for what we know will one day come.

[12] Anti-vax lawsuit
Date: Wed 17 Apr 2019
Source: US News [abridged, edited]
https://www.huffpost.com/entry/anti-vaxxers-sue-new-york-city-vaccine-mandate_n_5cb72678e4b082aab08f7133


A group of parents in Brooklyn are suing the New York City health department for ordering mandatory measles vaccinations in parts of the borough earlier this month [April 2019] amid a growing outbreak of the highly contagious virus. The mandate, which affects 4 zip codes in the Williamsburg area largely inhabited by an Orthodox Jewish community, is a violation of public health law, according to the lawsuit, filed Monday [15 Apr 2019] in Kings County Supreme Court.

Five mothers, identified only by their initials in the complaint, say they oppose vaccinating their children with the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella, for religious reasons. They're seeking a temporary restraining order against the mandate, calling it "capricious" and "contrary to law."

New York law requires every student entering or attending public, private, or parochial school to receive a cocktail of immunizations, though medical and religious exemptions are allowed. Many Orthodox Jews believe vaccinations run counter to Jewish or Talmudic law, leading to low vaccination rates in some communities, despite some rabbis who warn it's a mistaken belief with potentially dire consequences.

A mounting measles outbreak in the Williamsburg area prompted New York health officials to issue the mandate on [Tue 9 Apr 2019] requiring all people who live or work within zip codes 11205, 11206, 11211, and 11249 to receive the MMR vaccine if they haven't already.

As of Monday [15 Apr 2019], there were at least 267 confirmed measles cases in Williamsburg since September [2018], 39 of which were reported in the past week. New York health officials say Jewish yeshivas and day-care centers are of particular concern.

At least one day-care center in Williamsburg has been shut down since the mandate went into effect last week [week of Mon 8 Apr 2019] for failing to provide vaccination records for students and staff to the health department. More than 20 yeshivas and day-care centers have received citations for violating the order.

In their lawsuit, the parents argue the city's response to the measles outbreak has been "irrational" and that it doesn't pose a clear danger to public health.

One to 2 children out of every 1000 who contract the disease die from it, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

"We try always to respect religious rights, religious customs, but when it comes to public health, when we see a problem emerge, we have to deal with it aggressively," New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) said last week [week of Mon 8 Apr 2019]. "We are absolutely certain this is an appropriate use of our emergency powers."

Failure to comply with the 9 Apr [2019] order is a misdemeanor that could result in various penalties, including criminal fines or imprisonment, officials warned.

In their lawsuit, the parents of unvaccinated children say the mandate is causing "irreparable harm" and complained that they're being "treated like pariahs."

The order, issued by New York City health commissioner Oxiris Barbot, remains in effect until a New York City Board of Health meeting scheduled for Wednesday [24 Apr 2019], when it will be decided whether to continue or rescind the mandate.

Long-term measles-induced immunomodulation increases overall childhood infectious disease mortality
-------------------------
Vaccination against measles has many benefits, not only lifelong protection against this potentially serious virus. Mina et al. analyzed data collected since mass vaccination began in high-income countries when measles was common. Measles vaccination is associated with less mortality from other childhood infections. Measles is known to cause transient immunosuppression, but close inspection of the mortality data suggests that it disables immune memory for 2-3 years. Vaccination thus does more than safeguard children against measles; it also stops other infections taking advantage of measles-induced immune damage.

Abstract. Immunosuppression after measles is known to predispose people to opportunistic infections for a period of several weeks to months. Using population-level data, we show that measles has a more prolonged effect on host resistance, extending over 2-3 years. We find that nonmeasles infectious disease mortality in high-income countries is tightly coupled to measles incidence at this lag, in both the pre- and post-vaccine eras. We conclude that long-term immunologic sequelae of measles drive interannual fluctuations in nonmeasles deaths. This is consistent with recent experimental work that attributes the immunosuppressive effects of measles to depletion of B and T lymphocytes. Our data provide an explanation for the long-term benefits of measles vaccination in preventing all-cause infectious disease. By preventing measles-associated immune memory loss, vaccination protects polymicrobial herd immunity.

[This report is important reading for parents opposed to vaccination to help them understand the consequences of vaccine refusal. The protection against measles, mumps and rubella is just one of the many benefits of the vaccine, preventing the virus infection that leads not only to the specific disease itself, but also to general immunosuppression. - Mod.LK
