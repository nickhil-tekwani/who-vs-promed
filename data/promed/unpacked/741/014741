Indonesian health officials are investigating the deaths of 22 people
in the capital Jakarta over a 2-month period from an unidentified
illness characterized by high fever. Samples from the patients -- all
of whom died days after being admitted to St. Carolus hospital --
have been sent to the U.S.Naval Medical Research Unit 2 [NAMRU2] in
Jakarta, but the cause of death remains a mystery, said Nyoman
Kandun, a senior health ministry official.
"We have not been able to conclude if this is or is not a new
emerging disease," Nyoman told the Associated Press on Wed [27 Dec
2006]. "But after experiencing both bird flu and SARS (Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome) we do not want to take any chances."
Samples were also sent to the U.S.-based Centers for Disease Control
& Prevention (CDC), another health official said on condition he not
be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. Tests
there were also inconclusive.
Nyoman said the patients may have been poisoned, but for the time
being the cause of death was listed as from a "high fever of unknown
origin." Most of the victims were over 40 and from middle-class
residential areas near St. Carolus in central Jakarta. The hospital
started reporting the deaths in October and the last death was
reported on 27 Nov 2006, he said. Surveillance teams have visited the
homes of the patients but found no additional cases, and
investigators also concluded that they did not get their infections
from fellow patients at the hospital, Kandun said. There are 2 other
hospitals in the neighborhood, but they have not reported similar
mysterious deaths, he said.

[Human cases of avian influenza virus infection in Indonesia have
been in decline. The most recent human case of avian influenza A
(H5N1) virus infection was contracted about 7 Nov 2006 and the
patient died on 27 Nov 2006 [the same day the last undiagnosed death
above was reported - Mod.JW]. By that time the Indonesia Ministry of
Health had recorded 74 confirmed cases, of whom 57 have died; 12
probable cases, of whom 4 died; 187 suspect cases, of whom 50 died;
one exposure case; and in addition, 539 cases had tested negative for
H5N1 avian influenza virus infection. It is presumed that the 22
cases of "high fever of unknown origin" described above are included
in this latter category.
The report from Jakarta provides insufficient information to allow
speculation on the nature of this particular outbreak of febrile
illness among middle-aged and middle-income residents in a particular
suburb of Jakarta. Further information is requested. Description of
symptoms, an outbreak curve, information about illness in households,
contact with pets, and weather would also be helpful - Mods.CP/LL]
