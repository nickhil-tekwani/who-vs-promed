[The summarised animal-health related information on the northeastern
Indian epizootic, which reportedly started on 21 Nov 2008, with a map
including all accumulated foci, is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=7566>.
According to the data, 18 outbreaks have been recorded there so far.

Follow-up report no 4, submitted on 2 Jan 2009, is accessible (with
map) at the URL above. It addresses the 5 recent outbreaks, which
started in Assam between 17-19 Dec 2008. Out of the total of 27 438
susceptible birds on these 5 affected holdings, 299 cases were
observed (dead birds); the remaining 27 049 birds were reportedly
destroyed.

When the numbers of destroyed animals, as included in the immediate
notification and the 4 follow-up reports to the OIE are added up, the
calculated total, as of 2 Jan 2008, is 480 595 destroyed birds.

The following epidemiological commentary was included:
"Epidemiological investigation is ongoing. Stamping out of all
domestic poultry is being applied in an approximately 5-km (3-mi)
radius zone around the outbreaks followed by compensation of the
owners. An intensive surveillance campaign has been launched in a
10-km (6-mi) radius zone including:

o closure of poultry markets and prohibition on sale and
transportation of poultry products in the infected zone;

o disinfection of premises after culling and sealing of premises
where appropriate.

Restocking will be applied in accordance with a specific protocol." -Mod.AS]

[3] Future of H5N1
Date: Thu 1 Jan 2009

Researchers ponder future of bird flu
-------------------------------------
5 years after the avian influenza strain H5N1 started killing
poultry and people in Southeast Asia, researchers still don't know
what to make of the dangerous and unpredictable virus.

After cutting an ever-widening swath through poultry flocks and
infecting -- and killing -- mounting numbers of people in Asia, the
Middle East, and Africa, the virus seemed to almost take a breather
in 2008. The year that just ended saw fewer recorded human cases than
any since 2003, when this cycle of H5N1 activity began.

Science knows too little about how flu viruses emerge, spread, and
jump -- or don't jump -- from one species to the next to answer that
question. Given the knowledge gap, influenza scientists are still
pushing for pandemic preparedness.

"Whether or not H5N1 virus is going to cause a human pandemic --
nobody can predict that," says Dr Tim Uyeki, deputy chief of influenza
surveillance and prevention for the US Centers for Disease Control [&
Prevention]. "I believe it's still a threat. But it's not the only
threat," he adds, noting a 2-month-old Chinese girl was hospitalized
in Hong Kong in late December [2008] with an H9N2 avian flu infection.

Whatever the uncertainty about H5N1, one thing is clear. A fog of
exhaustion has settled over the influenza science community as well
as the public health officials who have been slaving over pandemic
plans. A healthy portion of the broader public is probably sick to
death of the subject too.

"I think flu fatigue is certainly a phrase, which is thrown around a
fair amount in the past several months or past year or so," admits Dr
Keiji Fukuda, head of the World Health Organization's global
influenza program.

[The decreased acuteness and alarming position of HPAI H5N1,
described above, has been reflected also in the number of ProMED-mail
postings addressing avian influenza during 2008. Since 2005, these
numbers were:
2005 - total number 566, of which 222 addressed human cases;
2006 - total number 610, of which 266 addressed human cases;
2007 - total number 442, of which 193 addressed human cases;
2008 - total number 240, of which 86 addressed human cases.

Maintaining the responsible, scientifically measured golden path
between wolf crying and complacency has remained one of ProMED-mail's
main objectives. - Mod.AS]
