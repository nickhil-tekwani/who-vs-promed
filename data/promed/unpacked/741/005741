A white-tailed deer in west Kentucky is the state's 1st confirmed case of hemorrhagic disease (HD) this year [2019] according to the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources in a release on Thursday [22 Aug 2019]. Murray State University's Breathitt Veterinary Center confirmed a deceased deer from Graves County tested positive for [EHD (epizootic hemorrhagic disease)]. [This disease is not blue tongue virus. They are separate viruses. - Mod.TG] Fish and wildlife officials are investigating 22 other possible cases in 11 counties and expect the number could grow in the coming weeks.

The disease is caused by [a virus transmitted by] small biting flies feeding on the deer. Outbreaks typically last from late summer to the 1st hard frost, which kills the flies.

The disease has been present in the USA for more than 60 years, officials say. It is not the same as chronic wasting disease. Most deer die from hemorrhagic disease within 24 to 36 hours after being bitten. Due to the rapid death, the carcasses can appear otherwise well-fed or normal. EHD cannot be transmitted to people or pets. Officials warn, however, deer with EHD can be susceptible to other diseases and caution against eating sick-looking deer.

West Virginia is experiencing an outbreak of epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) in the state's white-tailed deer herd, according to the Wildlife Resources Section of the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources (DNR).

So far this year [2019], deer have been found dead in small areas of Summers, Monroe and Greenbrier counties. EHD virus serotype 2 (EHDV-2) has been isolated from Summers County. Hemorrhagic disease can be caused by either EHDV or blue tongue virus (BTV). No BTV-infected deer have been detected. [It should be noted hemorrhagic disease is a general term. EHDV is a hemorrhagic disease. BTV is a separate and different hemorrhagic disease. They are not the same virus. - Mod.TG]

West Virginia samples were sent to the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study located at the University of Georgia, School of Veterinary Medicine, where they isolated and identified the virus as EHDV-2. Although this disease usually does not have a major impact on the deer population, the DNR Wildlife Resources Section is surveying the extent of the disease outbreak in the state. EHDV may cause local reductions in the deer herd of 20% or less.

"The disease disappears with the 1st frost, because the spread of the virus is dependent on small midges called culicoides, killed by cold temperatures," said Gary Foster, assistant chief in charge of game management for DNR.

EHD does not occur in West Virginia every year; the last large outbreaks of this disease in West Virginia were in 1996, 2002, 2007, 2012, and 2017. EHDV does not persist in deer that survive infection.

"Although hunters should never consume an obviously sick deer, EHDV is not a reason for hunters to be concerned about consuming their deer," Foster said. This disease is not contagious to humans, and EHDV is not related to chronic wasting disease, which has been detected only in Berkeley, Hampshire, Hardy, Mineral and Morgan counties.

Landowners and hunters in the Summers, Monroe, and Greenbrier county region are urged to report sick or dead deer to the DNR District 4 Office located in Beckley at 304-256-6947. If landowners find sick or dead deer in other regions of the state, they should contact their appropriate DNR district office.

[Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) is not the same as bluetongue virus (BTV). Although these diseases are similar, there is a difference in the serotype.

Many cervids can be infected with EHD virus (EHDV), and clinical cases have been reported in some species. White-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) are highly susceptible and are known to become ill after infection with serotypes 1, 2, 6, and 7. They are probably susceptible to all 7 serotypes. Clinical cases have also been reported occasionally in other species, including mule deer (_O. hemionus_), pronghorn (_Antilocapra americana_), North American elk (_Cervus elaphus nelson_), and pygmy brocket deer (_Mazama nana_).

Outbreaks and sporadic cases caused by various serotypes, including EHDV-1, EHDV-2, EHDV-6, and EHDV-7, have been reported in cattle, although subclinical infections seem to be much more common.

EHDV is transmitted by biting midges in the genus _Culicoides_ spp, which act as biological vectors. These midges can fly short distances of 1-2 km [about 0.6-1.2 mi], but they can be blown much farther by wind. Relatively little is known about which species of _Culicoides_ are the primary vectors in each area, although some (e.g., the North American species _C. sonorensis_) are proven to be competent vectors in the laboratory. While mosquitoes or other blood-sucking insects might theoretically be able to transmit this virus mechanically, and there is one report of virus isolation (EHDV-4) from two anopheles mosquitoes in Asia, such insects are thought to have little or no role in the epidemiology of this disease. Iatrogenic transmission has not been reported, but it is also theoretically possible.

Clinical cases in white-tailed deer range from peracute illness, with death often occurring within 36 hours, to a more chronic course with animals remaining ill for several weeks. Some deer are found dead with few or no clinical signs. In other cases, there may be fever, anorexia, lethargy, weakness, stiffness/lameness, respiratory distress, and severe and rapid edema of the head and neck. Swelling of the mucous membranes of the oral cavity, and swelling and hyperemia of the conjunctiva, are common. Ulcers and erosions in the oral cavity can result in excessive salivation and nasal discharge, which may both be blood-tinged. Diarrhea and dehydration have also been seen. Some animals develop progressive abnormalities in blood clotting, with extensive hemorrhages in many tissues including the skin and gastrointestinal tract. Deaths are common during the acute stage of the disease. Surviving animals may have ulcers, erosions, scars, and other damage to the lining of the rumen and omasum, resulting in prolonged lethargy and inappetence, and some animals become emaciated. There may also be breaks or rings in the hooves caused by growth interruptions, resulting in lameness. In severe cases, animals slough the hoof wall or toe; some of these deer may be found crawling on their knees or chest.

It is the time of year, frequently near the beginning of deer hunting season in many areas, when we start to see this disease. In some years EHD is seen earlier, and it appears this year (2019) the 1st cases are occurring a bit earlier than usual. However, a hard-killing frost tends to stop the disease from further spread, as the vectors die in the freezing weather.

While the northern states may groan at the thought of cold weather, some in the south may be glad to get a little cool weather. Either way, all will appreciate being rid of the vector transmitting this disease.
