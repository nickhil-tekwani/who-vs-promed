The Michigan Department of Agriculture (MDA) received confirmation of
canine brucellosis (CB) in 5 Michigan breeding kennels that sold
small, mixed breed, and pure bred dogs in Michigan. The Missaukee,
Osceola, Wexford, and Van Buren county kennels have been quarantined
and MDA is in the process of notifying purchasers.

Canine brucellosis is a contagious bacterial disease that causes
abortions, death of puppies shortly after birth, and chronic health
problems in older dogs. Canine brucellosis is a reportable disease
and an emerging concern in dog breeding facilities and "puppy mills"
in Michigan. There is no vaccine for the disease and no long-term
cure. Antibiotics will control the infection and spaying dogs will
minimize the risk of transmission to almost zero.

CB is considered a zoonotic disease, even though the risk of actual
human infection from a pet is very low. Although people can get CB
from infected pets, transmission is very rare. It is mostly
transmitted through handling birthing tissues from an infected dog,
although it can be transmitted in water and food dishes, in urine,
and in feces. Even though most dog infections generally do not result
in human illness, people with weakened immune systems are more
susceptible and should not handle dogs known to be infected with
canine brucellosis. There is also a higher risk to people working in
infected kennels.

MDA has limited information that CB might be present in other canine
populations. An individual in Macomb County adopted a rescued dog
from an animal shelter. The recently spayed female dog had signs of
illness and the owner brought it to her veterinarian. The dog was
tested and found positive for CB. The veterinarian treated the dog
with a course of antibiotics. The dog is home and is not considered
infectious.

To limit the potential spread of infection, the state veterinarian
strongly recommends pet shops purchasing puppies for resale require
the kennel of origin to provide evidence that all animals are tested
negative for brucellosis. This includes puppies from kennels in other
states.

The state veterinarian also recommends sexually intact dogs from
unknown backgrounds, adopted or rescued from animal shelters, be
screened for canine brucellosis. Note that state law requires adopted
dogs and cats to be spayed and neutered by the new owners, so we have
a public health safeguard.

MDA actions to contain canine brucellosis:
1. The breeding kennels have been quarantined and depopulated at the
owner's expense, or are on a test-and-remove program. With
test-and-remove, the kennel remains quarantined, with no sales
allowed, until there is no infection.
2. When possible, people who purchased or traded dogs from these
kennels have been contacted. We are contacting families in the
vicinities of infected breeding kennels as some neighbors' dogs were
allowed to breed at the kennels. Unfortunately, some of the kennel
operators do not have complete records, so the following additional
steps will be taken.
3. We are asking veterinarians statewide to be on heightened alert
for CB in small, mixed breed, and pure bred small dogs from shelters.
The Michigan Veterinary Medical Association (MVMA) is assisting MDA
by contacting practicing veterinarians. Veterinarians and their staff
exposed to the blood, or placentas, of infected dogs are at risk.

press report on the outbreak.

[There appears to be some evidence that the origin of the canine
brucellosis in Michigan may have been imported from a kennel in the
neighboring state of Indiana. Indiana authorities are reportedly
following up on this, but as of this positing the Indiana Board of
Animal Health has not updated their website regarding this disease.

We appreciate Michigan's state veterinarian Steve Halstead's action in
having the official website updated so quickly. - Mod.TG
