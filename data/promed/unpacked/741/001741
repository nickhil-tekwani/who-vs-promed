France widened "high risk" restrictions to the entire country after the detection of several cases of the highly pathogenic H5N8 avian flu strain in farms in southwest France and in wild ducks in northern France, the farm ministry said [Tue 6 Dec 2016].

The decision was also motivated by the "rapid change in the ... situation in France and in several European countries", the statement said.

The outbreak was detected [Thu 1 Dec 2016] on a duck farm in the southwestern Tarn region, the heart of the lucrative, though controversial, foie-gras industry.

It came just as a ban on exports outside Europe was about to be lifted in time for the crucial holiday period. Exports outside the European Union had been suspended after an outbreak a year ago, and producers were waiting for the green light -- which had been set for [Sat 10 Dec 2016] -- to resume shipments just in time for the Christmas holidays, when the delicacy is especially popular. Producers must now wait another 3 months for exports to resume, as long as no further cases are discovered.

The ministry, which said migratory birds were the likely source of the outbreak, announced later on [Tue 6 Dec 2016] a number of confirmed or suspected cases of bird flu in the southwestern regions of Gers, Hautes-Pyrenees and Lot-et-Garonne -- where ducks from the supplier of the Tarn farm had been transported -- leading to around 7000 further birds being culled. A further 4500 had died from illness.

A protection zone has been declared within a 3 km [approx. 1.86 mi] radius of the Tarn farm, as well as a 10 km [6.2 mi] surveillance zone.

French poultry farmers have been told to keep their flocks indoors or apply safety nets preventing contact with wild birds. Those who may not use confinement or safety nets because of animal welfare or quality requirements can ask to be exempted if they can prove sufficient biosecurity measures.

The H5N8 variant of bird flu, which also hit duck farmers in the Netherlands last month [Nov 2016], is highly infectious for poultry but poses little danger to humans.

The H5N1 strain, however, has killed more than 420 people, mainly in south-east Asia, since first appearing in 2003.

[HPAI has already been reported from 14 European countries (Hungary, Poland, Croatia, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Russia, Finland, Romania, France, Serbia and possibly Ukraine). It also continues its spread in the Middle East (this week new outbreaks in Israel, circulating also in Egypt, Iran and possibly Tunisia) and in southern Asia (India).

The HPAI H5N8 circulating viruses belong to the genetic clade 2.3.4.4 and share recent ancestry with Goose/Guangdong/96 lineage H5N8 HPAI viruses isolated in early June 2016 from wild birds in Tyva (Russia). In the past, the detection of this AI lineage in wild birds in southern Russia represented a signal for an upcoming incursion into South Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. According to WHO, based on the limited information obtained to date, human infection with this strain cannot be excluded, although the likelihood is low.

It is expected that HPAI H5N8 will continue to spread during the winter months within and beyond the affected countries. - Mod.AS
