[Sweden has implemented the most severe animal disease control
measure, stamping out, to eradicate the first 8 "outbreaks" (in fact,
detection of antibodies without clinical manifestation) of PRRS
within its boundaries.
It is not clear if the serological investigations had covered other
farms as well (apparently found negative), and in what context they
were performed. Was there a suspicion of introduced infected stock?
A clarification will be helpful. - Mod. AS].
