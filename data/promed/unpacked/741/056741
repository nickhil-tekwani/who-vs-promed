Angola: Marburg hemorrhagic fever death toll rises to 122
-----------------------------------------------
"We have not only asked the military for help, but also from around the
world, national and international, in the fight against Marburg," said
Luanda's provincial health director Vita Mvemba. He said Angola faced a
serious shortage of doctors countrywide, and, specifically, in the battle
against Marburg, which broke out in October 2004.
The death toll after an outbreak of [Marburg hemorrhagic fever] in Angola
has climbed to 122 on Mon 28 Mar 2005, as the country turned to civilians
and the military saying it did not have enough doctors to fight the Marburg
virus. The number of deaths was one short of the most serious outbreak ever
recorded of the hemorrhagic fever, which kills around one in 4 of those who
contract it, and for which a specific treatment is unknown.
He said Angola faced a serious shortage of doctors countrywide, and,
specifically, in the battle against Marburg, which broke out in October
2004, killing mainly children, according to the World Health Organization
(WHO). "There are not more than 1200 doctors in the country in certain
provinces, like Kuando Kubango (south), only 2," Mvemba told Agence France
Presse. In a separate interview with Portugal's TSF radio station, Mvemba
said: "We are facing serious manpower shortages. We do not have a great
many doctors who are able to tackle the gravity and scale of this
epidemic," he added. "The situation is difficult enough, especially when
the population and health professionals give way to panic, but we are going
to try to improve response mechanisms," he said.
Health ministry spokesman Carlos Alberto said a young girl, aged less than
2, died on Sunday [27 Mar 2005] evening in Uige, the epicentre of the
epidemic north of the capital city of Luanda. "This baby was the child of a
19-year-old woman who died on Sunday [27 Mar 2005] morning, and the baby
died the same evening," he said. The most serious recorded outbreak of the
disease was in the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) between
1998 and 2000, when 123 people died.
3/4ths of the deaths have been children under the age of 5, according to
the WHO, but the virus has also started to claim adult victims, including
at least 7 medical workers. lberto said many victims died because they
consulted kimbandeiros, or traditional healers, and only came to the
hospital when it was too late to do anything. "For example, the last nurse
to die in Uige was 1st taken to a kimbandeiro, and only when her condition
worsened was she brought to the hospital," he said.
Just across the DRC border from Uige province, the WHO and local health and
administrative officials have set up a crisis committee in case the
outbreak spreads across the frontier, the WHO epidemiologist in Kinshasa,
Florent Ekwenzala, said on Monday [28 Mar 2005]. "For the moment, no case
of Marburg fever has been reported in the DRC. The crisis committee has
been formed as a precaution in Matadi," the main town in Bas-Congo province
close to the border with Uige, Ekwenzala explained. DRC Health Minister
Emile Bongeli Yekolo was Monday [28 Mar 2005] due to travel to Matadi to
take charge of the work of the committee, whose task, according to the WHO,
will be "to put all health authorities and main hospitals along the Angolan
border on alert."
Mvemba said the "condition in the capital city was stable," with no more
deaths. "In a short while, we will be meeting to evaluate the situation in
Luanda. We will dispatch a team to the military hospital to check on the
health of a Portuguese national who has been there since Sunday [27 Mar
2005], to check if he has the disease." Of the 7 people who contracted
Marburg in Luanda, 2 have died, an Italian doctor and a 15-year-old boy who
both came from Uige. The epidemic has so far claimed the lives of 2 foreign
doctors, one Italian and the other Vietnamese.
Meanwhile, in former colonial power Portugal, a senior health official said
authorities were protectively checking on the cause of death of a
Portuguese national on Saturday [26 Mar 2005] shortly after his return from
Angola. Another Portuguese national, who had been in Uige province, was
hospitalized over the weekend for tests that proved negative.

[A potential access route for importation of Marburg hemorrhagic fever into
Europe via travelers between Angola and Portugal, mentioned in the final
paragraph, is an alarming development. Information on the cause of the
death of the returning Portuguese national would be appreciated (at present
there in no further information available in newswires).
In addition the possibility of introduction of Marburg virus into Europe,
the proximity of Uige Province to the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC) leads to concerns across the border as well. Of note, there was an
outbreak of Marburg virus in the DRC during the period 1998 - 2000 in the
northeastern part of the country, approximately 2000 kilometers from where
Uige borders with the DRC in the southwest of the country. - Mods.CP/MPP]
