A new Chinese study has reported a dramatic spike in rabies
infections. The research shows that in some provinces of China the
number of human rabies cases has jumped since the new millennium.

Jia-Hai Lu, from the School of Public Health at Sun Yat-Sen
University, China, led a team of researchers who studied the rabies
trend in China between 1990 and 2007. Lu describes how things have
changed in the last 8 years: "In China, human rabies was largely
under control during the years 1990-1996, via nation-wide rabies
vaccination programmes. Since the end of the century, however, cases
of human rabies have jumped high enough to trigger a warning sign for
control and prevention."

Rabies, an infection of the nervous system transmitted by animal
bites, causes over 50 000 deaths each year around the world. During
recent years, most of the research on control of rabies has
concentrated on the development of post-exposure prophylaxis
(preventative treatment -- in this case, preventing the worsening of
an infection). According to the researchers, "The use of human and
equine rabies immunoglobulins (HRIG/ERIG) has saved the lives of
countless patients who would have died if treated with vaccine alone.
However, both products are often in short supply worldwide and are
virtually unaffordable in developing countries." [See ProMED post
20080826.2659 Announcements (03): Rabies vaccine supply limited - USA
(CDC)].

Data from 22 527 human rabies cases from January 1990 to July 2007
were obtained from a surveillance database from the Ministry of
Health of China. The authors found that human rabies was under
control from 1990 to 1996, when only 159 cases of rabies were
reported, but this figure had leapt to 3279 cases in 2006.

The authors found that rabies was most frequently encountered in the
southwestern and southern territories of China, especially in highly
populated areas. Lu said, "The 4 rabies-endemic provinces lacked
strictly enforced measures to eliminate dog rabies or an ample supply
of modern cell culture rabies vaccines for humans." Most of the
patients were children or teenagers, and most contracted the disease
after being bitten by a dog, usually on the head and neck. According
to the authors, "In the worst-affected province, Guangdong, 62.5
percent of patients did not receive proper treatment on their wounds,
92.5 percent did not receive adequate post-exposure vaccination, and
91.25 percent did not receive any anti-rabies immunoglobulin."

The authors recommend that the current rabies control programme be
improved by increasing supervision, improving the interaction between
local and national authorities, increasing rabies awareness, and
altering urban planning and development to balance the interaction
between humans and animals.

[It is useful to read the full article, not so much for the summary
of incidence trends or methods but to fully appreciate the
application of potential control mechanisms. The authors emphasize
the need for improved availability and timely application of
anti-rabies biologicals and the undertaking of dog vaccination
programs for the control of rabies in dogs as critical elements for
success in reducing the rate of occurrence of rabies in China. Such
strategies have worked in other countries around the world and have
even previously worked in China in the 1990s. The failure of
effective dog vaccination programs in China is a step back.

CDC's (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Advisory
Council on the subject agrees with the importance of vaccination in
dogs in the following introduction:

"As a result of improved canine vaccination programs and stray animal
control, a marked decrease in domestic animal rabies cases in the
United States occurred after World War II. This decline led to a
substantial decrease in indigenously acquired rabies among humans. In
1946, a total of 8384 indigenous rabies cases were reported among
dogs and 33 cases in humans. In 2006, a total of 79 cases of rabies
were reported in domestic dogs, none of which was attributed to
enzootic dog-to-dog transmission, and 3 cases were reported in
humans. The infectious sources of the 79 cases in dogs were wildlife
reservoirs or dogs that were translocated from localities where
canine rabies virus variants still circulate. None of the 2006 human
rabies cases was acquired from indigenous domestic animals. Thus, the
likelihood of human exposure to a rabid domestic animal in the United
States has decreased substantially."

See "Human Rabies Prevention - United States, 2008, Recommendations
of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices" at
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr57e507.pdf>.

WHO's introduction to their section on rabies from the "WHO
recommended standards and strategies for surveillance, prevention,
and control of communicable diseases" includes 3 main control
strategies: post-exposure prophylaxis, pre-exposure immunization in
high risk groups, and control of the disease in dogs.

WHO provides further information in the introduction as follows:
"Rabies is a vaccine-preventable disease, and it is still a
significant public health problem in many countries of Asia and
Africa, even though safe, effective vaccines for both human and
veterinary use exist. Most of the 55 000 deaths from rabies reported
annually around the world occur in Asia and Africa, and most of the
victims are children: 30-50 percent of the reported cases of rabies
-- and therefore deaths -- occur in children under 15 years of age.
The main route of transmission is the bite of rabid dogs. Most of the
children who die from rabies were not treated or did not receive
adequate post-exposure treatment. Although the efficacy and safety of
modern cell culture vaccines have been recognized, some Asian
countries still produce and use nervous tissue vaccines, which are
less effective, require repeated visits to the hospital, and often
have severe side-effects. Moreover, these patients do not receive the
necessary rabies immunoglobulin, because of a perennial global
shortage and because of its high price, so that it is unaffordable in
countries where canine rabies is endemic.

"Due to complete absence of any successful medical treatment for
clinical rabies and the horrific nature of the disease, most rabies
victims die at home rather than being admitted to a hospital in
abysmal conditions. These circumstances add to the notorious lack of
surveillance data. Underestimating the health implications of rabies
leads many high ranking decision-makers in public health and animal
health to perceive rabies as a rare disease of humans resulting from
a bite of an economically unimportant animal (the dog). Therefore,
rabies usually falls between 2 stools and is not dealt with
appropriately either by the Ministry of Health or the Ministry of
Agriculture."
