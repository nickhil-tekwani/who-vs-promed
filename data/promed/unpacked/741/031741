The Perugorria locale, 5th section of the Curuzu Cuatia department
[of Corrientes province], recently has been the cause of anxiety due
to the appearance of various equine rabies cases, apparently produced
[transmitted by] vampire bats. Regarding the case detected in
Perugorria, the 1st immunofluorescence [IFA] test was positive, the
2nd test is biological and is still in progress [mouse inoculation?
PCR detection of rabies virus RNA? - Mod.TY]

The objective is to provide an alert about this situation and the
potential for human infection and because of this, a massive animal
vaccination against rabies will be undertaken in order to immunize
them against this disease, and also to preventively vaccinate those
who enter into contact with ill animals and residents of the area.

A meeting [of several local veterinary and human health organizations
and individuals] was convened in order to coordinate establishment of
a focal [epidemiological] barrier within a 10 km (6 mi) around the
area where these [infected] animals were detected.

The Ministry of Public Health will take follow up action for the bat
colonies in the area.

[This report mentions that there has been a vampire bat (_Desmodus
rotundus_) transmitted rabies epizootic starting in Corrientes
province in 1997, mainly infecting bovine animals. A prolonged but
sporadic epizootic began in Chaco province, continuing in Corrientes
province with human cases. - Mod.TY]

[This report is not clear about the number of suspected equine rabies
cases that have occurred in the current outbreak. Apparently, only one
was submitted for laboratory diagnosis and was IFA positive.
