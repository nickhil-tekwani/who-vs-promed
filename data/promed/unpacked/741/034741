UNDIAGNOSED HEMORRHAGIC FEVER - SUDAN (07): (DARFUR) COMMENT

In 1999, there was an outbreak of suspected haemorrhagic fever in southern Sudan, with an estimated 3600 deaths. Dr Lee Dunster, then working at KEMRI in Nairobi, visited Sudan on behalf of WHO and took clotted blood samples from which he decanted serum in the field without centrifugation and sent these samples to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in Johannesburg (it was known as the National Institute for Virology in those days).

I was head of the Special Pathogens Unit at the time, and we screened the samples for all of the usual causes of suspected haemorrhagic fever in Africa without positive result, and, as a last resort, I examined the serum samples by dark field microscopy for the possible presence of leptospires and was astonished to find borrelias.

Had the blood been centrifuged, I may not have found the borrelias. I consulted some old tropical disease textbooks and discovered that in the 1st half of the 20th century, before the advent of antibiotics, there had been massive epidemics of lethal louse-borne relapsing fever, with up to 20 000 deaths per outbreak in the Sudan.

We subsequently confirmed the identity of the bacterium as _Borrelia recurrentis_ by PCR. The borrelias did not prove to be viable in culture.

An investigative team consisting of Rumishael Shoo, M. Ryan and P. Tharmahornpilas from the World Health Organisation (WHO), D. Dennis, K. Orlsoki and D. O'Leary of the US Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC), and M. Kiruga from Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) went to Sudan to investigate on behalf of WHO and confirmed that there was widespread infestation with lice, and that the etiological agent of the disease was _B. recurrentis_.

At the cost of a few cents, patients can be treated for lice with an insecticide (pyrethroid) and treated for the infection with an antibiotic.

Interestingly, it is suggested that it was relapsing fever and not starvation that killed people during the Irish potato blight incident.

The posts relating to the 1999 incident can readily be recovered on search. Those who forget their history are doomed to relive it.

[ProMED thanks Professor Swanepoel for his timely comment. It is comforting to know that there are still experts with a historical memory of infections that we very rarely see in the industrialized countries but which emerge in times of war and displacement under poor and unhygienic conditions.

Indeed, louse-borne relapsing fever was reported from The Netherlands in July 2015 among asylum seekers (see the ProMED post below from 31 Jul 2015). It reminds us that outbreaks of haemorrhagic fever do not necessarily need to be viral but that bacteria like Leptospira and _Borrelia recurrentis_, malaria, and rickettsia belonging to the spotted fever groups can all be responsible. It underlines the need that multiplex PCRs developed for screening patients with haemorrhagic symptoms should include bacteria as well as viruses.

There was a large outbreak of yellow fever in Darfur in 2013 (see ProMED postings below), after which a WHO- and government-funded immunization campaign was estimated to have covered 85 percent of the population in the camps in Darfur for displaced persons (see the ProMED posting from 6 Jan 2015). This makes yellow fever a less likely potential cause of the present outbreak.

The outbreak of haemorrhagic fever in Darfur is still unresolved, and ProMED will be happy to post further information and comments. - Mod.EP
