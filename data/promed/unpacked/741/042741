Poliovirus weekly update 17 Jul 2019, WHO
-----------------------------------------
New wild polioviruses reported this week:
AFP cases: 5
Environment: 4

New cVDPVs reported this week:
AFP cases: 14
Environment: 3

Headlines
- In Central African Republic, a series of previously detected/reported VDPV2s have now been officially classified as "circulating". Since initial detection of the viruses in May [2019], the country had already operationally considered these viruses to represent an outbreak and implemented emergency outbreak response and declared the event to be a national public health emergency [see ProMED-mail. Poliomyelitis update (40): Central African Republic (MP,UK) cVDPV, WHO, RFI 20190529.6493464].
- A cVDPV2 originating in Jigawa, Nigeria, continues to spread. Genetically linked virus has been confirmed from an environmental sample in Ghana [see ProMED-mail. Poliomyelitis update (58): Ghana positive envir, global (Pakistan, China) 20190712.6564898].
- In Myanmar, a cVDPV1 has been reported and response measures are being implemented. Neighbouring countries have been informed of the confirmed cVDPV1, and surveillance for polioviruses is being strengthened across the region. Myanmar had previously successfully stopped a cVDPV2 outbreak in 2015.

Summary of new viruses this week:
- Afghanistan: 1 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case and 1 WPV1-positive environmental sample;
- Pakistan: 4 WPV1 cases and 3 WPV1-positive environmental samples;
- Nigeria: 3 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases, 2 cVDPV2-positive environmental samples, and 1 cVDPV2 isolated from a healthy contact;
- Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC): 5 cVDPV2 cases;
- Central African Republic (CAR): 3 cVDPV2 cases, 1 case classified cVDPV2 based on a positive contact, and 10 cVDPV2 community/close contacts;
- Angola: 1 cVDPV2 isolated from healthy child;
- Ghana: 1 cVDPV2-positive environmental sample linked to Jigawa/Nigeria outbreak;
- Myanmar: 2 cVDPV1 cases and 2 cVDPV1-positive contacts.

Afghanistan
- 1 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case has been reported in the past week in Musaqalah district, [Helmand] province. The onset of paralysis was on [5 Jun 2019]. There are 11 WPV1 cases reported in 2019 from Afghanistan. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2018 remains 21.
- 1 WPV1-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week from Kandahar district, Kandahar province. The sample was collected on [24 Jun 2019].

Pakistan
- 4 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been reported in the past week: 1 each from Jehlum and Lahore districts, Punjab province, with onset of paralysis on [21 and 22 Jun 2019]; 1 each from Bannu and Lakkimarwat districts, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, with onset of paralysis on [22 Jun 2019] and [1 Jul 2019]. The total number of WPV1 cases [is] 45.
- 3 WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week: 1 each from Quetta district in Balochistan province, Karachi district in Sindh province, and Bannu district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The samples were collected between [20 and 27 Jun 2019].

Nigeria, Lake Chad and West Africa
Nigeria:
- 3 cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) have been reported in the past week: 1 each from Wurno LGA, Sokoto State, Irewole LGA, Osun State and Baruten LGA, Kwara State. The onset of paralysis was on [20 May 2019, 9 Jun 2019 and 14 Jun 2019], respectively. There are 12 cVDPV2 cases reported in 2019 so far. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 remains 34.
- 2 positive environmental samples were reported in the past week: Sokoto North LGA, Sokoto State and Ilorin West LGA, Kwara State. The samples were collected on [10 and 13 Jun 2019], respectively.
- 1 cVDPV2 was isolated from a healthy child from Wurno LGA, Sokoto State. The sample was collected on [20 Jun 2019].
- Recent confirmation of spread of one of the cVDPV2 outbreaks, both within Nigeria and internationally, underscores the urgent need to fill remaining vaccination gaps in the ongoing outbreak response, and to optimize the geographic extent and operational quality of mOPV2 response.

Lake Chad:
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported in the past week.
- In the Lake Chad region, cVDPV2 linked to the outbreak originating in Nigeria has been detected in Niger (1 case in 2019 and 10 cases in 2018) and Cameroon (1 positive environmental sample, collected on [20 Apr 2019] in Extreme Nord).
The risk of further cVDPV2 spread across the Lake Chad subregion remains high.

West Africa:
- In Ghana, a cVDPV2-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week in Tamale district, Northern province. The sample was collected on [11 Jun 2019].
- Genetic sequencing has confirmed it is linked to the cVDPV2 originating from Jigawa, Nigeria.
- Across the GPEI partnership, the outbreak preparedness and response task team (OPRTT) is working with our regional and country colleagues in supporting local public health authorities in carrying out a full field investigation and determining if there is a risk of local spread of this virus that might require a response.
- Surveillance is also being strengthened in neighbouring Togo, Benin, Cote d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso.

Central Africa
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC):
- 5 cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) have been reported this week in the DRC: 3 from Malemba-Nkulu district, Haut Lomami province and 1 each from Tshumbe and Wembo-Nyama districts, Sankuru province. The onset of paralysis was on [10 Feb 2019, 30 May 2019, 26 May 2019, 23 May 2019, 3 Jun 2019], respectively. There are 11 reported cases of cVDPV2 in 2019. The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in 2018 is 20. DRC is currently affected by 7 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks: 1 each originated in Haut Katanga, Mongala, and Sankuru and 2 each in Haut Lomami and Kasai provinces.

Angola:
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported this week in Angola. A total of 3 cVDPV2 cases from 2 outbreaks are reported in Angola in 2019.
- A cVDPV2 case was isolated from a healthy child in Kuvango district, Huila province. The sample was collected on [10 Jun 2019].

Central African Republic:
- A series of previously detected/reported VDPV2s have now been officially classified as "circulating".
- 4 cVDPV2 cases have now been officially reported from 2 distinct outbreaks. In addition, the country had also already reported genetically distinct VDPV2s, and had therefore considered these emergencies as an outbreak, even prior to the official classification this week as "circulating".
- In response, the government had declared these events to be a national public health emergency and begun implementation of outbreak response.

Horn of Africa
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported in the Horn of Africa.
- Somalia has reported a total of 15 cVDPV cases (8 type 2, 6 type 3 and 1 coinfection of both type 2 and type 3) since the beginning of the outbreaks. The most recent cVDPV3 virus was from an AFP case from Runingod district, Middle Shabelle province with an onset date of paralysis on [7 Sep 2018]. cVDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in 1 environmental sample in Kenya collected on [21 Mar 2018]. There is also 1 reported case of cVDPV2 in Ethiopia, linked to Somalia, with onset on 20 May 2019.

Papua New Guinea
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 remains 26.
- The most recent cVDPV1 virus was isolated from an environmental sample collected in the National Capital district on [6 Nov 2018].
- A GPEI Outbreak Response Assessment reviewed the impact of current outbreak response and concluded that overall strong response had been implemented. Commending national and subnational public health authorities and health workers on their efforts, the assessment team underscored the need on now filling any residual subnational surveillance and immunity gaps.
- The team reviewed all aspects of the response, and noted significant efforts and improvements, including on service delivery, surveillance strengthening, data analysis, cold chain/reverse cold chain refurbishment, vaccine acceptance and community engagement, health worker engagement, collaboration with neighbouring Indonesia and outreach to remote areas/communities. In particular, the group noted the strong collaboration between outbreak response and strengthening of routine immunization, including through systematic collaboration with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and highlighted that this model of working should be replicated in other outbreak settings.

Mozambique
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreak has been reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 remains 1.
- In addition to the confirmed case, the same virus was also isolated from 2 healthy community contacts, reported on [10 and 17 Dec 2018].
- The GPEI and partners are working with country counterparts to support the local public health authorities in conducting a field investigation (clinical, epidemiological and immunological) and thorough risk assessment to discuss planning and implementation of immunization and outbreak response.

Indonesia
- No circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) cases were reported this week.
- In total, 3 genetically linked cVDPV1 isolates were detected from Papua province: a cVDPV1 from an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case, with onset of paralysis on [27 Nov 2018], and 2 cVDPV1 isolates from healthy community contacts, collected on [24 Jan 2019] and [13 Feb 2019]. This outbreak is not linked to the cVDPV1 in neighbouring Papua New Guinea.

Iran
- In total, 3 WPV1-positive environmental samples have been reported in 2019, all from Sistan and Balochistan province. The isolated viruses have been detected in environmental samples only, and genetic sequencing confirms they are linked to WPV1 circulating in Karachi, Pakistan.
- The Ministry of Health and local health authorities are undertaking a detailed investigation and the partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) are on standby to provide support as required. An immediate risk assessment suggests that this event has limited public health implications, given Iran's very high levels of routine immunization coverage and strong disease surveillance. However, this event further underlines the risk of international spread of WPV1 from Pakistan/Afghanistan.

China
- No cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in the country remains one.
- China continues to maintain strong routine immunization coverage both with IPV and bivalent OPV reaching more than 95% nationwide, and strong poliovirus surveillance including through environmental surveillance.
- The Government of China is reacting rapidly and efficiently to confirmation of the cVDPV2 by conducting a full field and epi-investigation, strengthening disease surveillance, investigating the origin of the virus and planning an appropriate outbreak response.
- China had successfully responded to a WPV1 outbreak in 2011, stopping an outbreak (due to an importation from Pakistan) in record time.

Myanmar
- 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) cases have been reported this week from Papun district, Kayin province. The onset of paralysis was on [22 May 2019 and 14 Jun 2019].
- 2 cVDPV1 viruses were isolated from contacts in Papun district, Kayin province. Both the samples were collected on [18 Jun 2019].
- Myanmar's routine immunization coverage is strong, estimated at 89% at national level for bivalent OPV. Neighbouring countries have been informed of the confirmed cVDPV1, and subnational surveillance is being strengthened across the region.
- The Ministry of Health and local health authorities are undertaking a detailed investigation and the partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) are providing support as required. A full epidemiological and virological field investigation is ongoing, including to ascertain the source and origin of the isolated viruses; active surveillance is being strengthened; subnational population immunity levels are being analyzed; and outbreak response is being planned.

[This week's global update is very sobering, with a total of 8 countries reporting poliovirus activity confirmed during the past week since the last update. Two countries were reporting WPV activity (Pakistan, Afghanistan) and 6 were reporting cVDPV activity (Nigeria, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic, Ghana, Angola and Myanmar). It's interesting that in the past 12 months, outbreaks associated with cVDPV activity in African countries have involved cVDPV2 and cVDPV3 (only Somalia), and outside of Africa, the outbreaks have involved cVDPV1 (China, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia). A curious observation. One can't help but wonder if host genetics are playing a role here.

Other information involves confirming the isolate in Ghana is related to the ongoing outbreak of cVDPV2 that started in Jigawa, Nigeria, adding another location to this, and the addition of a 7th cVDPV2 outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the confirmation of outbreaks of cVDPV2 in the Central African Republic.

To visualize all of this activity, I am putting links to HealthMap/ProMED maps of countries with poliovirus activity during the past 12 months below. The size of the list as it grows is impressive.

[2] Nigeria (Kogi) suspected cases
Date: Fri 19 Jul 2019
Source: The Guardian [edited]
https://guardian.ng/news/after-10-years-polio-free-2-unconfirmed-cases-reported-in-kogi/


Two unconfirmed cases of the polio virus have been reported in Kogi State after being polio-free for 10 years. Dr Abubakar Yakubu, executive director, Kogi Primary Healthcare Development Agency (KSPHCDA), disclosed this on Friday [19 Jul 2019] at a stakeholder meeting with the Social Mobilisation Committee (SMC) for National Immunisation Plus Days (NIPDs) in Lokoja. Yakubu said that the 2 cases of polio virus were reported in Ankpa and Dekina local government areas (LGAs) of Kogi, saying, however, that they were yet to be confirmed.

"Kogi State has been polio-free for more than 10 years now, but unfortunately we are beginning to get some very discouraging signals. In fact, recently there were unconfirmed reports yet, of polio virus in Ankpa and Dekina LGAs of Kogi State, although it has not been confirmed. But we have dispatched a team of experts to take samples of those cases and carry out appropriate investigations; the team is already on that task. This is why we need to intensify our social mobilisation and campaign, especially for [these] NIPDs, that is centered on polio vaccination for our children and some other commodities," Yakubu said.

He, therefore, appealed to all the SMC members drawn from various fields and organisations to take the assignment very seriously. "The health of our children, mothers and us is very important to everybody, including the leader of our state, Gov. Yahaya Bello. I want to believe that whatever role we play, we are doing it in the interest of our children, mothers, and the state at large. I pray that God will help us achieve this goal," Yakubu said.

On his part, Mr Adolphus Okoro, technical assistant, National Emergency Routine Immunisation Coordination Centre (NERICC) NPHCDA, Abuja, urged Kogi government to strengthen the SMC to function maximally for effective mobilisation and service delivery across the state. Mr Olorumaiye Theophilus, the Programme Director, SERICC, said some vaccines would be introduced to children at 9 months' immunisation during the NIPDs to prevent meningitis.

Responding, a member of the SMC, Mr Titus Alonge, of the Teens Education Development & Information Initiative Nigeria (TEDiiN), an NGO, advised the state to carry members of the SMC along in all its operations. Mrs Abo Amodu, social mobilisation focal person KSPHCDA, assured the SMC members of adequate involvement in their activities henceforth. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the house-to-house immunisation for children from age 0 to 59 months would last for 4 days between 20 and 23 Jul [2019], across the 21 LGAs of Kogi.

[Kogi state shares a western border with Kwara state where there has been ongoing cVDPV2 activity this year (2019) (see https://nigerianfinder.com/map-of-nigeria-states/). While it is premature to raise an alarm that there is cVDPV activity in Kogi state, as there hasn't been laboratory confirmation of poliovirus in these cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), it is noteworthy that the state is taking this seriously and announcing an alert of AFP case identification in the state. Given the high attention to this, a positive identification of a poliovirus in a case of AFP in this state would lead to an alert, and a rapid response with polio vaccine to interrupt transmission of the virus. - Mod.MPP]
