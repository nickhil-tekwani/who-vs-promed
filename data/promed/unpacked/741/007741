2003/012 Situation of grapevine yellows in France
A review of the phytosanitary situation of grapevine yellows in France in
2002 indicates that an outbreak of Grapevine flavescence doree phytoplasma
(EPPO A2 quarantine list) in Savoie was confirmed in 2001 (352 infested
plots), and 36 plots were removed because infection levels exceeded 20
percent (corresponding to 1.9 ha).
In the southwest, the outbreaks detected in 2001 in Midi-Pyrenees (near
Moissac and Cahors) have developed further in 2002, and older outbreaks (in
Poitou-Charentes and Aquitaine) were reduced, as in 2001. In the southeast
(Languedoc-Roussillon), a noticeable decrease was also noted, but many
isolated infected plants remain and represent possible points of future
development if vectors are not controlled.
At the end of 2001, a new outbreak was detected in the south of the Drome
department at the border between the Rhones-Alpes and Provence-Alpes-Cote
d'Azur regions. Surveys are incomplete, but it seems that this occurrence
was confirmed in 2002.
Grapevine bois noir phytoplasma (EPPO A2 quarantine list) occurs at low
incidence in many grapevine-growing regions in France (EPPO RS 2001/166).
Sodium arsenite, the only curative plant protection product available
against bois noir, was withdrawn from use at the end of 2001. Enforcement
of phytosanitary measures is required to ensure destruction of infected
material.

[Grapevine yellows diseases occur worldwide, causing significant damage to
grapevines. The causal phytoplasma of Flavescence doree (FD) is transmitted
by the leafhopper _Scaphoideus titanus_; Bois noir (BN) and the similar
disease Vergilbungskrankheit (VK) are transmitted by _Hyalesthes
obsoletus_(Hemiptera, Cixiidae), the vector that transmits the stolbur
phytoplasma to solanaceous crops. Phytoplasmas are emerging as major
pathogens of many food crops.
