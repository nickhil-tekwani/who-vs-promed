Human rabies deaths have been directly linked to involvement in the slaughtering, butchery, handling, and even consumption of meat from infected dogs. More than 80 animal charities from across Asia and the rest of the world have signed an open letter to global governments to take action to end the dog meat trade as a way to tackle the deadly disease.

Professor Louis Nel of Global Alliance for Rabies Control says: "We may not be able to easily change culture or habit, but we should ensure compliance with proven animal disease prevention measures and stop the smuggling of dogs, to limit the spread of rabies, an endemic disease across Asia. These traders are driven solely by profit and are disregarding the risks to human and animal health."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States said: "There are reports that dog-meat markets have a higher rate of rabies than the general dog population, as people often sell dogs to the markets when they act sick; some of these sick dogs have rabies. Furthermore, there are at least 3 published reports of humans acquiring rabies from activities associated with the dog meat market, emphasising that the risk is very real."

While rabies can be effectively controlled and eradicated through dog vaccination programs, restricting the movement of dogs is vital for the process to be effective. Organisations from across the globe, including China, Hong Kong, Viet Nam, the Philippines, Indonesia, India, Cambodia, Singapore, Taiwan as well as Europe, the United Kingdom and the United States, are highlighting the significant role that the dog meat trade can play in spreading the lethal rabies virus throughout Asia.

The World Health Organisation and the Global Alliance for Rabies Control have both acknowledged the link between the spread of rabies and the dog meat trade. The US House of Representatives voted this month [September 2018] to ban the trade of dog and cat meat in the United States. In Viet Nam, Hanoi's vice mayor Nguyen Van Suu recently urged residents to stop eating dog meat. The move is part of a nationwide program to stamp out rabies by 2021.

But Humane Society International/Viet Nam director, Tham Thi Hong Phuong, says the country needs actions not just advertising campaigns. He added: "We estimate that around 20 000 dogs are transported every month from the south to the north of Viet Nam for slaughter, creating an easy way for rabies to be spread across the country. It's encouraging to see the Hanoi authorities publicly acknowledge the risk and commit to banning the trade from central districts in Hanoi by 2021, but if they are serious about tackling rabies, they need to get serious about stamping out the dog meat trade across the whole country."

[2] Morocco: rabies statistics
Date: Mon 1 Oct 2018

Rabies continues to spread in Morocco despite the existence of a national multisectoral strategy. According to the latest statistics from the Ministry of Health, published on the occasion of the World Day [28 September] against this disease, 15 cases of human rabies were notified in 2017. The Ministry also reports that 65 000 people were vaccinated in 2017 while receiving post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) after being bitten or scratched by animals, especially by stray dogs. In 9 out of 10 cases, the affected person was contaminated by a rabid dog. Indeed, the reservoir and main vector of this disease is the dog, which is at the origin of the majority of the contaminations as WHO points out: "In up to 99 per cent of the cases in humans, the disease is transmitted by domestic dogs, but the virus can infect other domestic animals as well as wildlife. It is transmitted to humans, in general, by the saliva of infected animals during a bite or scratch." In Morocco, 400 cases of animal rabies are reported each year.

As regards the distribution of human rabies cases by region, Casablanca-Settat is 1st, with 83 cases notified during the period 2000-2017, followed by the regions of Rabat-Sale-Kenitra (55 cases), Marrakech-Safi (49 cases), Souss-Massa (42 cases), Fes-Meknes (37 cases), Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima (32 cases), Beni-Mellal-Khenifra (30 cases), Oriental (22 cases) and Draa-Tafilalet (17 cases). The provinces most affected are those that concentrate a high density of the canine population. The analysis of epidemiological data shows that 9 provinces record more than 40 per cent of cases. They are Kenitra, El Jadida, Settat, Sidi Kacem, Kela Sraghna, Chtouka Ait Baha, Errachidia, Taounate, and Beni Mellal.

The national rabies strategy has not succeeded so far in eradicating rabies in Morocco. There are several reasons for this situation, starting with the lack of reliable statistics on the canine population, especially domestic dogs. There is a lack of continuing education among health professionals and especially a lack of an evaluation of the national program. The lack of awareness and communication about this disease among citizens is another major problem. Other obstacles include weak intersectoral coordination between the animal health and human health sectors at both central and provincial levels, non-compliance by local communities with hygiene standards in slaughterhouses and landfills, and inadequate vaccination measures in animals.

Post-exposure prophylaxis raises the issue of accessibility and availability of vaccines and other anti-rabies treatments in rabies centers. To this is added the problem of the availability of trained personnel in the field of prophylaxis.

The major challenge is to eliminate rabies in Morocco by moving from a control strategy to an eradication strategy. This serious viral disease could be virtually eradicated if 70 per cent of dogs were vaccinated, as recommended by WHO. The Ministry of Health is optimistic and says it will be possible to eliminate the disease by 2030.

[Numerous obstacles are listed to address the challenges facing rabies control in Morocco, despite the availability of preventive vaccines for animal use and the almost satisfied demand for vaccines given to humans following animal bites and scratches. Another crucial issue is the lack of reliable statistics on the canine population, from which any ambitious national program that can achieve the target of ending human rabies by 2030 should start. This is what Cote d'Ivoire has done to get off to a good start in the realization of its national program. - Mod.AB
