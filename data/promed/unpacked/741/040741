The deadly H7N9 bird flu virus has arrived in Hong Kong, it was confirmed last night [2 Dec 2013]. The city activated its flu contingency plan after an Indonesian domestic worker who recently travelled to Shenzhen was found to have contracted the deadly new strain, the 1st case in the city. The 36-year-old patient is in a critical condition in Queen Mary Hospital with severe pneumonia and breathing with the help of an artificial lung. The live-in helper works for a couple with 2 children, and all 4 were said to have minor flu symptoms and were under observation in quarantine at Princess Margaret Hospital.

Secretary of the Food and Health Bureau Dr Ko Wing-man said: "Since the helper had travelled to Shenzhen, where she had killed and cooked a live chicken, we believe it is a case imported [from the mainland]." Health officials are looking for a 2nd person who accompanied the helper to Shenzhen on 17 Nov 2013. The helper developed flu symptoms 4 days later. She was first treated at Tuen Mun Hospital but was transferred to Queen Mary last Wednesday [27 Nov 2013].

Ko said 2 earlier tests for the virus came back negative, but a 3rd test last night [2 Dec 2013] confirmed she had contracted H7N9. He added that the risk of human-to-human transmission could not be ascertained yet, but he activated the city's 3-level response system set up to deal with a potential flu pandemic. It was set at the "serious level," one step below the top emergency level. Live poultry imports from 3 Shenzhen farms will be suspended until the Centre for Health Protection completes an investigation.

Since the 1st case of H7N9 infection in a human was reported in February 2013, the virus has killed 45 people, all on the mainland. About 138 people on the mainland were infected and one in Taiwan. Most of the cases were in Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces and Shanghai. In November 2013, a 3-year-old boy in Dongguan, Guangdong was confirmed with the disease.

University of Hong Kong microbiologist Ho Pak-leung said there was not enough evidence to show that the virus could spread between humans. Ho said the public should remain vigilant, but that there was no need to panic.

H7N9 now is into a gateway city, Shenzhen, just north of Hong Kong. It may be an isolated case, as the information is sketchy at best on the vectors, but it is surely a bird-to-human infection, as she was a poultry worker.

H7N9 shuts down the kidneys; pneumonia develops, and most patients pass away before the immune system can recover, even with dialysis. More information is needed as to when she was infected, where she was infected and what her incubation time has been.

Shenzhen is just to the northwest of Hong Kong and a quick bus ride, and H7N9 is onto a plane and out into the world.

SFH chairs meeting of steering committee on preparedness plan for influenza pandemic
-----------------------
The Secretary for Food and Health, Dr Ko Wing-man, today (December 3) again convened a meeting of the Steering Committee on Serious Response Level under the Preparedness Plan for Influenza Pandemic to follow up on the latest development of the first confirmed human case of avian influenza A (H7N9) in Hong Kong and relevant contingency measures.

The meeting comprises representatives from the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health, Hospital Authority (HA), the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD), the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD), the Education Bureau (EDB), the Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, Tourism Commission, the Home Affairs Department (HAD), the Information Services Department, the Social Welfare Department and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD).

At the meeting, the HA reported on the latest condition of the index patient and other related persons, while the CHP reported on the source of contracting the disease and the tracing of contacts with the patient.

The patient is in critical condition at the Intensive Care Unit of Queen Mary Hospital. The CHP has so far successfully contacted over 200 persons who had contacts with the patient, including 17 persons with close contacts. Of which, 10 home contacts of the patient were tested negative for the H7N9 virus after rapid test at this stage. Close contacts without any symptoms will be arranged to stay in non-hospitalised quarantine facilities. It is expected that five close contacts without any symptoms will be sent to Lady MacLehose Holiday Village of the LCSD in Sai Kung for quarantine tonight.

The HA has also taken measures in preparation for activation of Serious Response Level in public hospitals and the conduct of rapid test, while its expert group has met to discuss the clinical issues relating to the treatment protocol on H7N9.

The DH would strengthen the port health measures. Relevant departments will help disseminate information on preventive measures for H7N9 to enhance public awareness.

With regard to imported live poultry, the patient has reportedly visited a live bird market in Shenzhen, slaughtered and cooked a live chicken for consumption. But details are not available. As a precautionary measure, we have suspended the import of live poultry from the registered farms in Shenzhen starting from today. The supply of live poultry in Hong Kong was not affected today.

The FEHD has stepped up cleansing and disinfection of retail outlets for live poultry, as well as enhanced inspection to ensure strict compliance with the rule against overnight stocking of live poultry. The Department has also disinfected the patient's residence.

The AFCD has conducted visits to 15 local chicken farms and taken specimens for testing. No irregularity was detected. It will conduct visits to the remaining 15 local chicken farms tomorrow. At the same time, the Department will continue to inspect the poultry wholesale market, Yuen Po Street Bird Garden and pet bird shops etc. to ensure that the birds are in healthy and normal condition. It has also issued letters to the trade reminding them to stay alert and strictly follow the biosecurity and hygiene measures. The Department will continue to take samples from dead birds and poultry for testing of avian influenza.

The Government will continue to monitor the situation and maintain transparency in release of information. The CHP has set up a designated website and issued letters to inform the relevant trades the latest information and precautionary measures against the disease through the network of the EDB, the HAD and the Tourism Commission.

The public are reminded to maintain good personal hygiene, wash hands frequently and avoid contacts with birds and poultry, while travelling the public should avoid visit to any poultry markets. For enquiries, the public can visit the website of CHP or call its hotline (2125 1111) which operates from 9am to 6pm.

The 17 close contacts of the Indonesian woman involved in Hong Kong's 1st confirmed H7N9 case, have tested negative for the virus.

Secretary for Food & Health Dr Ko Wing-man told the media today [3 Dec 2013] they include the domestic helper's employer, family members, patients in her Tuen Mun Hospital ward, and a 33-year-old Indonesian friend who travelled with her to Shenzhen last month [November 2013].

He said the helper is receiving intensive care at Queen Mary Hospital and her condition remains critical.

Those not showing symptoms will be sent to the Lady MacLehose Holiday Village in Sai Kung for medical surveillance.

Dr Ko said the Centre for Health Protection has so far traced more than 200 people that may be associated with the case, including the 17 close contacts.

Infection control measures are being enhanced at hospitals, live chicken stalls in markets, chicken farms, and boundary checkpoints, he added.

A dedicated page been set up to educate the public on preventing avian influenza, he said, urging people to enhance their personal hygiene.

He said the Government will monitor developments.

Shanghai will suspend live poultry trading from [31 Jan 2014], the 1st day of the Chinese Lunar New Year, until [30 Apr 2014] to prevent a recurrence of the bird flu. The suspension will be an annual feature for the next 5 years, dependent on the evaluation and warning of the bird flu and the seasonal onset, according to a joint statement issued by the Shanghai Agricultural Commission and the Shanghai Commerce Commission.

All the designated wholesale and retail markets will be banned from trading in poultry and violators face hefty fines between 10 000 yuan (USD 1641) and 30 000 yuan (USD 4924) under a new rule that took effect in June [2013].

Unlicensed street vendors who sell live poultry during the period will be punished by urban management teams. Poultry from other cities and provinces must be sent to designated slaughterhouses and cannot enter the local market directly, it said.

Residents are being urged to report any illegal trades of live poultry to market watchdogs on hotline 12315 of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Administrative Bureau, 12331 of the Shanghai Food and Drug Administrative Bureau, 12316 of the Shanghai Agricultural Commission, and city's urban management at 52921111 or 63166666.

In April [2013], all live poultry markets were shut down in Shanghai after 43 people died of H7N9 bird flu in China. The ban was lifted in June [2013] and about 110 poultry markets returned to business.

Experts have said there was a possibility of H7N9 recurrence and suggested a complete ban on live poultry business. China's mainland has reported 5 cases of H7N9 this autumn [2013] -- 3 of them in neighboring Zhejiang Province. The mainland has reported 134 cases by the end of September [2013], with 45 fatalities, according to the National Health and Family Planning Commission.

[Earlier in the year (2013) the termination of the outbreak of human cases of avian H7N9 influenza virus infection in southeastern China was attributed to introduction of measures banning of live poultry trading. A resurgence of human cases of H7N9 influenza case in early autumn was unwelcome and tentatively attributed to seasonal factors. It appears from the report above that the resurgence of cases may in fact be related to the fact that the ban on live poultry trading was lifted in June and about 110 poultry markets in the Shanghai region (and elsewhere?) returned to business. It is to be hoped that proposal by the Shanghai authorities to suspend live poultry trading from 31 Jan 2014, the 1st day of the Chinese Lunar New Year, until at least 30 Apr 2014 will be implemented elsewhere in south China to abort the recurrence of H7N9 avian influenza infection in the human population. - Mod.CP
