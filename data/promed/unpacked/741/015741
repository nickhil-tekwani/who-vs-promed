Fatal Salmon Virus Outbreak in Clayoquot UNESCO Biosphere Reserve
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Mainstream Canada, a Norwegian-owned company, has reported an outbreak of infectious haematopoietic necrosis (IHN) virus on one of their open net-cage salmon farms in Clayoquot Sound. The farm, one of 20 sites in the Clayoquot Sound UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, is located at the entrance to a provincial park that encompasses a fjord, the Megin River estuary, old-growth Sitka spruce forests and salmon spawning habitat.

IHN is endemic to wild Pacific fish, and at low concentrations is not deadly to them. However, salmon farms amplify diseases like this, much like in a crowded hospital, where pathogens which are normally not an issue can become deadly.

Dr. Kristi Miller, Head of the Molecular Genetics section at the Pacific Biological Station, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), found infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAv) and piscine reovirus (PRV) on 2 other Clayoquot Sound salmon farms late last year [2011]. Both viruses are of European origin and deadly to wild salmon. These farms were not culled and no further testing has taken place.

Friends of Clayoquot Sound spokesperson said, "Despite the abundance of pristine salmon habitat, Clayoquot's salmon runs are in dramatic decline, with some runs now being counted in the tens, rather than in the tens of thousands. Mainstream has applied for a new salmon feedlot to be located at Plover Point along the shore of Meares Island near Tofino. With the Cohen Commission of Inquiry into the Decline of Fraser River Sockeye Salmon report not due out until 30 Sep 2012, and these deadly viruses present here in the Clayoquot Sound Biosphere Reserve, this is not the time to be expanding this industry."

[IHN virus is a rhabdovirus that causes acute, systemic disease in salmonid fish and also occurs in asymptomatic fish hosts. The virus is currently endemic throughout the Pacific Northwest of North America, with a contiguous range extending from Alaska to California and inland to Idaho. Within this geographical area the host range of IHNV includes 5 species of Pacific salmon, Atlantic salmon and several trout species. The 1st reported epidemics of IHNV occurred in sockeye salmon (_Oncorhynchus nerka_) fry at Washington and Oregon fish hatcheries during the 1950s.

Because farmed salmon are kept at high densities, stress and high pathogen density may act in synergy predisposing the fish to develop clinical disease. As the virus is native to that region, farmed salmon infected with IHNV does not represent a major concern for native wild populations, as would a foreign virus such as ISA. Portions of this comment were extracted from Kurath et al. (2003; J Gen Virol 84:803-814).
