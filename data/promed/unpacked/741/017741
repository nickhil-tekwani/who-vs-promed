The northern mountainous provinces of Son La, Lai Chau, Dien Bien, Lao Cai, and Yen Bai have reported an outbreak of rabies, after 200 people were bitten by dogs, 16 people having died from the deadly disease.

In Yen Bai Province, the local Department of Animal Health said that more than 100 dogs were rabid, and 130 residents in Mu Cang Chai District were suffering from the disease, most of them being children. So far, 3 people have died from the infection.

Nguyen Van The, director of the health center in Mu Cang Chai District, said this is the 1st time rabies has broken out in the district, so people are not aware and avoid going to clinics for anti-rabies vaccination.

In Yen Binh District in Yen Bai Province, tens of people have been bitten by dogs, while 2 of them died due to negligence.

The Department of Animal Health said that rabies is quite widespread, but the department staff is facing difficulties in injecting dogs as the province is so large.

Son La Province saw the disease last summer [2012] and still suffers from it now. At least 7 people have died of the disease. Dogs belonging to residents are bitten by stray dogs and transmit the virus.

People need to protect their pet dogs and not allow them to roam freely without a leash. They need to take their pets for regular checkups to the local veterinary center.

[Although the newswire above reports that 130 rabies cases including 3 deaths were identified in Mu Cang Chai district of Lao Cai province, the reported time period of these cases is not mentioned. Local authorities should implement measures to raise awareness about cleaning and immunization for people who are exposed to rabies, and make the vaccines more available and affordable to people.
