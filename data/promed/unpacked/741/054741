Visceral leishmaniasis (kala azar) continues to spread in southern Sudan
----------------------------------
A serious bout of the deadly disease kala azar (characterised by acute
fever), which hit parts of southern Sudan about 6 weeks ago, is now
reaching alarming levels. According to an international medical relief
organisation, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), more than 1000 patients are
currently undergoing treatment, and the figure is likely to increase.
A press statement from MSF says its projects in Eastern Upper Nile State
are treating 406 and 210 patients in Lankien and Malakal towns,
respectively, while another programme in Umm el Kher in Gadaref State is
taking care of 414 cases. "The number of admissions continue at a rate of
100 per week in Lankien alone," Dr Yoseph Melaku, who had just arrived from
the affected areas told AANA last week. Melaku described the outbreak as
severe, saying that in previous cases, the number of patients hardly exceed
200 at high season, while during low season, only about 20 people suffer
serious attacks. He noted that malnutrition, displacement and poor access
to health care reduce people's natural immunity and that such conditions
are responsible for widespread outbreaks of such infections. Prior to a
recent ceasefire agreement between Sudan government and the Sudan Peoples'
Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A), humanitarian organisations have had
difficulties in accessing war-torn areas in the Sudan. The second phase of
peace talks between the Sudanese government and the SPLM/A being held in
Kenya have since yielded a ceasefire agreement banning all military
activity for as long as the talks are going on. MSF is now optimistic that
they will be able to access most of the affected zones. "The ceasefire
agreement may mean that we can soon get into areas that we have not been
able to reach until now," said MSF's operational director, Dr Antonio Bastos.
Kala azar, which is medically referred to as visceral leishmaniasis, is a
parasitic disease transmitted by the sand fly. If left untreated, the
illness can be fatal. The disease is endemic in parts of Sudan, Ethiopia,
and Somalia and usually peaks during this time of the year. Melaku said
there are a lot of sand flies in southern Sudan and control of the disease
may be complicated due to the wide area covered by the flies. Residents are
advised to sleep under mosquito nets in order to avoid being bitten by the
fly. MSF said the major setback for medical relief organisations is the
high cost of drugs and the need for more research and development efforts
to realise effective treatments.
