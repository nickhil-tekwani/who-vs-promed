[When subscribers download the ASF map available at the URL above,
they will certainly appreciate -- as we did -- the commendable, newly
introduced improvement in the WAHID interface, allowing the display
of information for domestic species or wild species or both. The
outbreak in domestic pigs in Krasnodar will display as a red circle
(key: continuing, domestic), while the case in a wild boar in
Ingushetia displays an orange triangular (key: continuing, wild);
please zoom-in.

The differentiation of outbreaks between domestic and wild species is
done in immediate notifications and follow-up report maps when
outbreaks are reported in both species and also in disease outbreak
maps. Users can now select wild species (yellow triangles) and/or
domestic species ("continuing outbreaks", red circles; "resolved
outbreaks", blue circles) and differentiate between the outbreaks of
events occurring in domestic and/or wild species. See also at the end
of the commentary below. - Mod.AS]

[Following its initial introduction into Georgia, probably through
the Black Sea Georgian harbour of Poti during the 1st quarter of
2007, ASF has been continuously spreading in the Caucasus region,
continuing its northwards march in southeast Europe. Initially
affecting the territories of Georgia, Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabagh,
Armenia, and Azerbaijan, ASF penetrated Russia in November 2007. The
Russian epizootic has now completed its 1st year, during which it has
spread into and within the territories of Chechnya, North
Ossetia-Alania, Ingushetia, Orenburg (outside the Caucasus;
reportedly, wildlife affected), the Stavropolskiy Kray (Stavropol)
and, as reported in the notification to the OIE above, a 6th
administrative division of the Russian Federation, namely the
Krasnodarskiy Kray (Krasnodar). The total number of outbreaks
reported to the OIE by Russia since the start of its epizootic on 5
Nov 2007 has reached 45 as of 12 Nov 2008; see a summary, with a map
including all said outbreaks, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=6546>.

Russia's declared policy addressing the control of ASF has undergone
evolutionary changes during the year (2008). The 1st and 2nd
follow-up reports, related to the Chechnya outbreaks, did not mention
applied or planned stamping out. The 3rd and 4th follow-up reports,
related to Ossetia, mentioned "modified stamping out" as a planned
(=future) control measure, informing about a limited number of
slaughtered animals but no animal culling. Follow-up reports 5-9,
related to the outbreaks in Ingushetia, Orenburg Stavropol, and
Krasnodar, mention "stamping out" as a planned control measure; no
stamping out is mentioned among the applied control measures. As
described in the current follow-up report 9, out of a total of 6798
susceptible animals 298 were infected, of which 245 died and 538 were
destroyed. It may be assumed that the 53 surviving infected pigs were
included among the destroyed animals; information on the selection
criteria of the other destroyed animals, and the compatibility of
this policy with the term "stamping out" (or rather "modified
stamping out" - see further), will be helpful.

OIE's definitions are:
"Stamping-out policy -- means carrying out under the authority of the
Veterinary Authority, on confirmation of a disease, the killing of
the animals which are affected and those suspected of being affected
in the herd and, where appropriate, those in other herds which have
been exposed to infection by direct animal to animal contact, or by
indirect contact of a kind likely to cause the transmission of the
causal pathogen. All susceptible animals, vaccinated or unvaccinated,
on an infected premises should be killed and their carcasses
destroyed by burning or burial, or by any other method which will
eliminate the spread of infection through the carcasses or products
of the animals killed. This policy should be accompanied by the
cleansing and disinfection procedures defined in the Terrestrial Code."

"Modified stamping-out policy should be used in communications to the
OIE whenever the above animal health measures are not implemented in
full and details of the modifications should be given."

Russian territories in the Caucasus since the start of the Russian
epizootic, please go to

Swine fever confirmed in another south Russian region
-----------------------------------------------------
The African swine fever virus (ASFV) has spread to a 4th region in
Russia's southern Stavropol Territory, the region's chief vet said on
Wednesday [5 Nov 2008].

Vets have already begun culling pigs in the Yutsa village which has
been affected by the virus. Over 11 000 pigs have already been killed
in the area following the recent outbreak.

Experts say that pork from the culled animals can be consumed once it
has been correctly processed.

5000 pigs were culled or died from the virus this summer in Russia's
North Caucasus republic of North Ossetia.

The virus does not pose a threat to humans.
