Now, several states in the country have been affected by the measles outbreak, with Mumbai being the worst-hit city with 303 cases so far. Cases of this highly communicable disease, which mostly affects children, are constantly rising in Maharashtra and have claimed several lives in Mumbai.

Kerala is also witnessing a measles outbreak with 160 cases of the disease reported thus far. The government is urging parents to be on the lookout for the signs and symptoms of the disease and ensure that their children are vaccinated against measles. Amid the outbreak, a special inoculation drive is also being undertaken to control the surge. ...

In a follow-up on the measles outbreak in South Africa, the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) reports from 1 Sep 2022 to 30 Nov 2022, 99 laboratory-confirmed measles cases were reported in Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces. Laboratory-confirmed measles cases in Limpopo province increased to 77 and 22 in Mpumalanga province.

The most affected districts in Limpopo province are Greater Sekhukhune district, Mopani district, and Waterberg district. In the Mpumalanga province, increased laboratory-confirmed measles cases were reported in the Elukwatini area in the Gert Sibande district.

The ages of measles cases in the Limpopo province ranged from 3 months to 42 years, while in the Ehlanzeni district in Mpumalanga province, measles cases ranged from 4 months to 13 years. The most affected age group is the school-going children, 5-9 years age group (n = 37, 37%) in Mpumalanga province and 1-4 years old (n = 29; 29%) in Limpopo. Three laboratory-confirmed measles cases were hospitalized and no measles deaths have been reported in Limpopo province and Mpumalanga province.

In Limpopo province, 53 laboratory-confirmed measles cases had unknown vaccination histories, 12 did not receive any measles vaccine doses, 10 were fully immunised with 2 doses, and 2 were partially immunised with one dose. In Mpumalanga province, in 13 laboratory-confirmed measles cases vaccination histories were unknown, 6 did not receive any measles vaccine dose, and 3 were fully immunised. Overall, 18 laboratory-confirmed measles cases of the 33 cases (55%) with known vaccination histories did not receive a single dose of the measles vaccine making them susceptible to measles virus infection. Information on why the children are not vaccinated with the measles vaccine needs to be collected to improve the vaccination programme in both affected provinces.

[Unsurprisingly, case counts continue to rise in both India and South Africa from the last update (20221128.8706948). This largely ties to cases in unvaccinated or partially vaccinated individuals. However, the number of individuals in South Africa noted as being fully vaccinated, but infected, is somewhat surprising. Additional information would be appreciated on whether those cases in fully vaccinated individuals are being driven by immune status due to other underlying disease(s), and/or other factors, would be appreciated. - Mod.JH
