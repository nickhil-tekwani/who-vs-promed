All are now convinced that the deaths of cows were due to [ruminal
trematode] worms, and so far, there is no laboratory evidence of
anthrax.
Thanks to Dr. Hugh Jones for pointing out the etiological agent --
_Paramphistomum cervi_.
However, there were also the deaths of about 500 chickens in the
area, which, according to experts, is due to cold weather and not
linked with the bird flu.
