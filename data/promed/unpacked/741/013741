MECHANICAL TRANSMISSION BY MOSQUITOES (6)
=========================================

Relating to the current discussions on the possibility of mosquitoes being
involved in viral transmission:
I wonder if I could ask how folks feel about the mild possibility of viral
transmission occurring through blood contact coming about from squashing the
blighters against the wall.
Apart from the stained wall I have always wondered just whose blood (and how
fresh) is now nicely deposited on my hand!
