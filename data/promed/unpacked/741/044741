1st record of Plum pox potyvirus in Tunisia
-------------------------------------------
So far Plum pox potyvirus (PPV - EPPO A2 list) had not been found in
Tunisia. In 2000, mother blocks of _Prunus_ were tested for the presence of
viruses. Random collection of suspicious samples did not, at that time,
result in the detection of PPV. However, appearance of virus-like symptoms
in leaves and fruits of Japanese plums (_Prunus salicina_) in stone-fruit
tree germplasm collections led to further screening tests. Plant material
was taken from collections of Japanese plum at 2 locations (Grombalia in the
Cap Bon region and Sbikha in the Kairouan region) where suspicious symptoms
had been observed.
Samples were collected from 34 trees at Grombalia and from 82 trees at
Sbikha, corresponding in total to 11 different cultivars. Samples were
tested for the presence of PPV by grafting onto GF 305, and by serological
and molecular tests. Results confirmed the presence of PPV at 2 locations on
57 _P. salicina_ trees (corresponding to 9 cultivars). Only PPV-D was
detected.
It is hypothesized that PPV had been introduced into Tunisia with imported
plants for planting. All infected trees have been destroyed. PPV is a very
serious threat to _Prunus_ production and strict phytosanitary measures are
needed to prevent any further spread of sharka in Tunisia.
The situation of Plum pox potyvirus in Tunisia can be described as follows:
Present, first reported in 2004, found in 2 germplasm collections of _Prunus
salicina_, under official control.

[PPV causes sharka disease, which is probably the most severe disease of
plum. There is no cure or treatment for the disease once a tree becomes
infected; infected trees must be destroyed. Several aphid species can
transmit plum pox within an orchard and over short distances (about 1000
feet [300 meters]) to trees in nearby orchards. Long-distance spread usually
occurs as a result of the movement of infected nursery stock or propagative
materials.
There are 4 strains of plum pox virus: PPV-D, PPV-M, PPV-EA, and PPV-C. PPV-
M isolates are more aggressive in peach, are aphid-vectored more
efficiently, and spread more rapidly in an orchard. PPV-M has been reported
to be seed-transmitted while other PPV strains are known not be transmitted
through seeds. Both PPV strains M and D infest peach, plum, and apricot. PPV-
C infects sweet and tart cherry naturally, and has infected other _Prunus_
hosts experimentally. To date, no other PPV strains have been reported to
infect cherry naturally.
Once the disease becomes established, control and prevention measures for
plum pox include field surveys, use of certified nursery materials, control
of aphids, and elimination of infected trees in nurseries and orchards.
Sources of resistance exist in _Prunus_, but are not abundant. A team of
scientists from the USA and France has genetically engineered a plum pox-
resistant plum (otherwise known as C5), and the resistance can be
transferred through hybridization to other plum trees.
