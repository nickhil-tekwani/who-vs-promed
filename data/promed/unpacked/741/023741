[The ICPI of the causative NCD virus in these outbreaks shows they were
velogenic (highly pathogenic) strains.
For details on the performance of the ICPI tests, see chapter 2.1.15 of
OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00038.htm>.

viral shedding following vaccination with commercially available Newcastle
disease virus vaccines upon challenge with highly virulent virus from the

Most virulent viruses will give ICP indices that approach the maximum score
of 2.0, whereas lentogenic (low pathogenic) strains will give values close
to 0.0. - Mod.AS]
