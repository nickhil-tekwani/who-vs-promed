An outbreak of bubonic plague was first reported in the Zambezia province
of Mozambique in late Dec 1997, with 30-50 cases and no fatalities.
According to Malaria and Tropical Disease Weekly dated 9 Feb, no new cases
have been reported, allaying fears that the disease might spread into South
Africa. A 21 Jan 1998 article in Eye News service quoted Dr. David
Durrheim, communicable disease control consultant with the Mpumalanga
health department in South Africa as saying that wild rodent populations
have been infected in Zambezia 3 times over the last 4 years, but that
climatic conditions had to be severe before the disease was seen in South
Africa. Although Durrheim admitted that the Free State and Mpumalanga had
witnessed outbreaks in the past.
