In what doctors claim to be only the 2nd case in the country where a rabies patient has survived, the Command Hospital (Western Command), Chandimandir, Panchkula, [Haryana state] has managed to bring back a comatose 16-year-old suffering from the disease to consciousness.

He is reportedly only the 13th case, worldwide, since 1976, when records began to be kept, to have survived rabies.

The 16-year-old patient, a native of Gurdaspur [Punjab], had been bitten by a stray dog on [25 Mar 2014], and was given 4 doses of anti-rabies vaccine at a local hospital. He slipped into a coma on 29 Apr 2014 and needed a ventilator and airway support when shifted from a private hospital to the Command Hospital with a diagnosis of rabies on 8 May 2014. Colonel FMH Ahmad, a neurologist, who treated hum, told the Hindustan Times: "When he came to us, he was in a coma." After treatment at the Command Hospital, he is now awake. He is smiling, but is not a normal person yet as he is not speaking. His brain has been damaged. Neurological recovery may take 2 years." The boy is being fed through a tube in the stomach. "He is under observation and his health is a matter of concern. However, his father is happy as the boy has survived," said Colonel Ahmad.

Colonel Ranjit Nair, nephrologist, Colonel Vijay Dutta, lung specialist, and Colonel Hari Kumar, endocrinologist, are the other doctors who treated the patient. "This is only the 2nd case [in India] where a rabies patient has survived. The 1st case of a survivor was reported in April [2014] at the Goa Medical College. The research paper regarding it was published in the Journal of [the Neurological] Sciences by Dr Aaron de Souza and Professor SN Madhusudana," said Colonel Ahmad [see abstract at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24582283].

The patient's evaluation was carried out with the expertise of the Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC), Department of Virology, Pune, and the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurological Sciences (NIMHANS), Department of Neurovirology, Bangalore, using cutting-edge molecular techniques. The AFMC reported a positive test of the virus DNA [RNA?]. Prof SN Madhusudana, the WHO expert on rabies and co-author of the 1st Indian report on a rabies survivor, found evidence to support diagnosis of rabies. The skin biopsy, also from NIMHANS, confirmed the diagnosis.

"I have been following the patient from day one. The case is a miracle. I have been practicing neurology since 1991 and this is the 1st survivor I have seen," said Dr Vivek Lal, professor and head of neurology, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh. Prof Madhusudana also confirmed that [this case] case was that of a rabies survivor.

"13 reported survivors, including this boy, in 60 000-odd cases annually, all fatal, underscore the uniqueness of the phenomenon," said Colonel Ahmad.

[The recovery of a patient from clinical rabies in Wisconsin in 2004 (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5350a1.htm)
is well known and was the 1st documented recovery from clinical rabies by a patient who had not received either pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis for rabies. According to: "Human rabies: neuropathogenesis, diagnosis, and management" (T Hemachudha et al. Lancet Neurol. 2013;12(5): 498-513. doi: 10.1016/S1474-4422(13)70038-3), rabies is an almost invariably fatal disease that can present as classic furious rabies or paralytic rabies. Recovery has been reported in only a few patients, most of whom were infected with bat rabies virus variants, and has been associated with promptness of host immune response and spontaneous (immune) virus clearance. Viral mechanisms that have evolved to minimise damage to the CNS but enable the virus to spread might explain why survivors have overall good functional recovery. The shorter survival of patients with furious rabies compared with those with paralytic rabies closely corresponds to the greater amount of virus and lower immune response in the CNS of patients with the furious form. Rabies virus is present in the CNS long before symptom onset: subclinical anterior horn cell dysfunction and abnormal brain MRI in patients with furious rabies are evident days before brain symptoms develop. How the virus produces its devastating effects and how it selectively impairs behaviour in patients with furious rabies and the peripheral nerves of patients with paralytic rabies is beginning to be understood. However, to develop a pragmatic treatment strategy, a thorough understanding of the neuropathogenetic mechanisms is needed.

A recent case was described (MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2012; 61(4): 61-5. http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6104a1.htm) where in May 2011, a girl aged 8 years from a rural county in California was brought to a local emergency department (ED) with a 1-week history of progressive sore throat, difficulty swallowing, and weakness. After she developed flaccid paralysis and encephalitis, rabies was diagnosed based on 1) detection of rabies virus-specific antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), 2) a compatible clinical syndrome in the patient, and 3) absence of a likely alternative diagnosis. The patient received advanced supportive care, including treatment with therapeutic coma. She was successfully extubated after 15 days and discharged from the hospital 37 days later to continue rehabilitation therapy as an outpatient. The public health investigation identified contact with free-roaming, unvaccinated cats at the patient's school as a possible source of infection. Several of these cats were collected from the school and remained healthy while under observation, but at least one was lost to follow-up. A total of 27 persons received rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for potential exposures to the patient's saliva. No further cases of rabies associated with this case have been identified. Rabies prevention efforts should highlight the importance of domestic animal vaccination, avoidance of wildlife and unvaccinated animals, and prompt PEP after an exposure.

It will be important to establish if the protocol devised in Panchkula is applicable elsewhere in the treatment of patients exposed to canine rabies virus infection.

Maps of India can be seen at http://www.mapsofindia.com/images2/india-map.jpg and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=2774778,12460. According to Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panchkula Panchkula is a planned city in Panchkula district, Haryana, India. It forms part of a metropolitan area with the Union Territory of Chandigarh and the city of Ajitgarh in Punjab state. The city hosts the Chandimandir Cantonment, the headquarters of the Western Command of the Indian Army. Panchkula is surrounded by Himachal Pradesh in the north and east, Punjab and Chandigarh Union Territory in the west, and by Ambala district in the south and east. - Mod.CP]

[I would add that a troubling aspect of this case is that the boy would likely never have developed rabies had optimal post-exposure prophylaxis been given. According to the media source, he received vaccine, but not immune globulin that would most certainly have been administered in more resource-rich settings. Human rabies immune globulin or equine immune globulins are very expensive and often not administered in the areas of the world where rabies is common. And of course control of canine rabies through vaccination could prevent many of these cases. - Mod.LM]
