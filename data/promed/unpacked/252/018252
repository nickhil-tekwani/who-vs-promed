The Public Health Emergency of National Importance in Sao Paulo
state, which began in March 2009, has notified through 19 Mar 2009 a
total of 7 suspected cases of sylvan yellow fever (YF), of which 5
have been confirmed, with 3 recovered from the illness and 2 deaths
(case fatality rate 40 percent). Of the 5 confirmed, 3 were men and 2
women, all aged from 1-39 years. None of them had been vaccinated; 3
had probably been exposed during their professional activities in
rural Itatinga and the other 2 while fishing for leisure in Sarutaia;
2 cases remain under investigation, with probable exposure for one in
Itatinga and for the other in Sarutaia. Onset of the 1st suspected
case was 22 Feb 2009 and of the most recent 14 Mar 2009.

[The 1st human cases of YF in Sao Paulo state since 2000 occurred last
year (2008). The disease is in one of its cyclic expansion phases; in
2008, it spread to Parana (PR) and Rio Grande do Sul (RS) states for
the 1st time in 42 years, and from there into Paraguay; see ProMED
archives below.

The true case fatality rate is probably much less than 40 percent,
since mild and undiagnosed cases will be missing from the denominator.

The occurrence of several cases of sylvan yellow fever in Brazil at
this time is of particular concern because dengue virus outbreaks are
still occurring there, spread by the urban vector mosquito _Aedes
aegypti_ which is also the urban YF vector. This situation brings the
risk of spill-over of yellow fever virus from the sylvan (jungle)
transmission cycle into an urban epidemic.
