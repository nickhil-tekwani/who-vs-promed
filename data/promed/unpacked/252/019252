BRITISH FAN DIES OF LEGIONNAIRES' DISEASE
July 2/98
PA News
By Paul Peachey, PA News
The U.K. Foreign Office was cited as announcing tonight that a 32-year-old
football fan from Blackpool has died of Legionnaires' disease after
travelling to France for the World Cup Finals.
Three other fans -- two Scots and another Englishman -- have also fallen
ill with the disease after visiting France.
Three of the men went to a football match in Paris and one had not,
according to a spokesman.
The French Health Ministry said the cases appeared so far to be unrelated.
None of the afflicted fans had travelled in the same group or stayed in the
same hotel at the same time.

[Excerpts
July 3, 1998
French health ministry officials said Friday that four people have been
struck down by Legionnaires' disease, and one has died.
The officials said the cases had been discovered by a health monitoring
network set up for the World Cup tournament. The cases have been identified
since June 29.
One of those diagnosed with the potentially lethal infection has died, one
is in the hospital in France and two others were hospitalized in Britain,
they said. The three still alive were all in serious condition requiring
round-the-clock care.
An investigation carried out with British health authorities found no link
between the four cases. Ministry investigators were attempting to contact
friends and family members who may have accompanied the four people to pin
down where they had been before falling ill and the likely cause [they must
mean 'source' - Mod.JW of the infection.
