The moderator commented recently re the rabies cases in Nepal that rabies is an easily controlled disease, achievable within 3 years by vaccinating dogs. Leaving aside the issue of wildlife rabies, which does not lead to many human cases, I would still like to politely disagree.

In an world where all domestic dogs are owned, are confined/confinable/catchable and where their breeding is controlled as well as other diseases such as distemper/parvo that cause a rapid population turn over, I would agree. However, the reality of many countries is very far from this ideal. I last lived in Kathmandu in the mid 1990s, but I would be surprised if very much has changed in the dog population. There are clearly owned and confined domestic dogs but I would guess they are the minority. Most dogs live on the street and are a mixture of community dogs and truly feral dogs. There is a rapid turnover of animals with most not surviving their 1st year.

Producing meaningful "herd immunity" (perhaps pack immunity is a better term here, but I doubt it) is difficult to impossible in these situations. It requires a long term approach based around stabilising the dog population through a mixture of catching dogs and neutering and vaccinating them against not just rabies but also other diseases. That this can work has been clearly shown, not least in India, but it is not yet widespread and it also tends to break down over time unless strictly monitored.

I am currently living in Pristina [Kosovo] and the situation here in terms of dog population ownership status is not dissimilar to Nepal in a way, but there is some attempt to catch, neuter, and vaccinate street dogs. Remarkably, most street dogs here seem to be approachable and friendly; they seem to mostly be community owned/cared for to some extent. Many have ear tags that seem to indicate they have been caught etc. In Ankara [Turkey], I saw a similar situation with regards to dogs being captured, neutered, and vaccinated although those dogs are not so friendly; but you do at least see the same dog on the same street corner over prolonged periods. In Tirana [Albania], the street dogs are also a combination of community cared for (seeing a lady feeding a street dog every morning with her very well cared for Lhasa Apso by her side, also clearly friendly with the street dog she was feeding, was illuminating) and out and out feral. They are not caught/neutered/vaccinated in anything like sufficient numbers and the population turnover is rapid with the same dog not being seen very often.

The reality is that the dog population is very complex and variable. It makes rabies control difficult to establish and maintain. To make it absolutely clear, forms of dog "control" such as shooting and poisoning are both inhuman and ineffective. Rounding dogs up and euthanising them humanely is barely humane (the rounding up process is very stressful) and will also not work. Street dogs exist because there is a food source and unless you round up all of them, they will quickly breed back to use that resource.

In the absence of sustainable programs of catching/neutering/vaccinating the only option I can see that would work is an oral vaccine in a bait that is licensed for use in domestic dogs. There have been small trials of this but it doesn't seem to be on the horizon so far. It would certainly help although it won't answer the problem of population turnover.

[Fair comment. However I must admit to first witnessing canine rabies control in Brazil where in poor areas the dogs were semi-communal, both privately owned and loose. It was very effective based on annual vaccinations, each with revisits in which local children were used to catch any dogs not wearing a cheap, colored 'vaccinated' marker collar.

The suggestion that we should seriously consider oral vaccination of 'street' and feral dogs in places like those described by Nic has a logic, and the dispersal of such vaccine bait would be much cheaper and easier than having to use airplanes as are used in eradicating wildlife rabies. In some places the dogs might even be hand fed the vaccine bait. Obviously it would have to be preceded by a public awareness programme to discourage humans, and especially children, from chewing on the vaccine loaded and tasty bait. Unfortunately at this point I must cut the thread. The primary purpose of ProMED-mail is emerging disease reporting, not disease control. With thanks to all who participated on this topic. - Mod.MHJ
