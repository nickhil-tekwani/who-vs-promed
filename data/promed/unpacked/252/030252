Influenza activity continuing to decline in the WHO European Region
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
-------
- This issue is based on data reported in week 13/2011 [28 Mar-3 Apr
2011] by 47 Member States in the WHO European Region.
- Clinical consultation rates for influenza-like illness (ILI) and/or
acute respiratory infections (ARI) continue to decline in 35
countries, and are lower than previously observed peaks in 38
countries.
- Sentinel surveillance for hospitalised severe acute respiratory
infections (SARI) in 10 countries suggests that SARI hospitalizations
have also passed previous peaks in each of these countries.
- 18 percent of sentinel specimens from patients with ILI or ARI, and
15 percent of specimens from sentinel SARI patients tested positive
for influenza, a decline from recent weeks.
- Influenza B now represents a large majority of influenza detections
from sentinel sites in the Region.

Current situation -- week 13/2011 [28 Mar-3 Apr 2011]
-----------------------------------------------------
Of the 42 countries reporting on the intensity of respiratory disease
activity, 38 reported a low intensity and 5 reported a medium
intensity. Of 43 countries reporting on the geographical spread of
influenza, 31 reported none or sporadic activity. Local activity was
reported in 6 countries, while 5 reported regional activity, and one
(Croatia) reported widespread activity. The impact of influenza on
health care systems was reported to be low in 22 and moderate in 2 of
the 24 countries reporting on this indicator.

Trends in clinical and virological data suggest declining influenza
activity in the Region. Clinical consultation rates for influenza-like
illness (ILI) and/or acute respiratory infection (ARI) activity
continue to decline in 35 countries, and are lower than previously
observed peaks in 38 countries. In addition, of the 17 countries
indicating a baseline threshold for influenza activity, all reported
ILI or ARI clinical consultation rates to be below the seasonal
threshold. Declining trends in influenza positivity rates can also be
observed in 16 of the 18 countries that have reported consistently on
this indicator. Data from sentinel hospital-based surveillance for
SARI were reported from 10 countries: Albania, Armenia, Georgia,
Kazakhstan, Romania, the Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federation,
Serbia, and Ukraine. Sentinel SARI hospitalizations have declined to
levels below previous peaks in all of these countries. This has been
accompanied by concurrent declines in the percent of sentinel SARI
specimens testing positive for influenza. There has also been a
decrease in the relative percentage of sentinel SARI hospitalisations
in persons over age four years. Although Kyrgyzstan reported an
increase in sentinel SARI hospitalizations during the current week, no
sentinel specimens from these patients were reported to be positive
for influenza, and this increase was mostly the result of recent
hospitalisations in the 0-4 age group. Further information on the
sentinel SARI surveillance systems represented in the EuroFlu bulletin
can be found in the "Overview of sentinel SARI systems in EuroFlu".

Virological situation -- week 13/2011 [28 Mar-3 Apr 2011]
---------------------------------------------------------
Pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 was reported to be dominant in 2
countries and co-dominant with influenza B in 3 countries. Influenza B
was reported to be dominant in 10 countries.

Sentinel physicians collected 590 respiratory specimens, of which 106
(18 percent) were positive for influenza virus: 18 (17 percent) were
influenza A and 88 (83 percent) were influenza B. Of the influenza A
viruses, 15 were subtyped: 15 (100 percent) as pandemic A(H1). In the
12 countries testing 20 or more sentinel specimens, influenza
positivity ranged from 0 percent to 50 percent, with a median of 11
percent (mean: 20 percent). In addition, 587 non-sentinel specimens
were reported positive for influenza: 315 (54 percent) influenza A and
272 (46 percent) influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 261 were
subtyped: 247 (95 percent) as pandemic A(H1) and 14 (5 percent) as
A(H3).

Sentinel hospitals participating in SARI surveillance (10 countries)
collected 113 sentinel SARI specimens of which 17 (15 percent) were
positive for influenza (compared to 25 percent positive in week
12/2011 [21-27 Mar 2011]). Among the 5 countries testing 10 or more
sentinel SARI specimens, the percentage testing positive for influenza
ranged from 0 percent in Kyrgyzstan to 30 percent in Georgia (median:
8 percent, mean: 13 percent).

Cumulative virological update -- weeks 40/2010-13/2011 [4 Oct 2010-3
Apr 2011]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 82 150 influenza virus detections were reported during
this period, of which 58 399 (71 percent) were influenza A and 23 751
(29 percent) were influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 46 551 were
subtyped: 44 879 (96 percent) as pandemic A(H1), 1671 (4 percent) as
influenza A(H3) and 1 as influenza A(H1).

>From week 40/2010 [4-10 Oct 2011] through week 13/2011 [28 Mar-3 Apr
2011], 1521 of 5343 sentinel SARI specimens (28 percent) tested
positive for influenza. Of these influenza viruses, 863 (57 percent)
were influenza A, and 658 (43 percent) influenza B. Of the influenza A
viruses, 684 were subtyped: 632 (92 percent) as pandemic A(H1) and 52
(8 percent) as influenza A(H3).

Since week 40/2010, 4443 influenza viruses have been characterized
antigenically: 2262 were A(H1) pandemic A/California/7/2009
(H1N1)-like; 1865 were B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (B/Victoria/2/87
lineage); 150 were A(H3) A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like; 164 were
B/Florida/4/2006-like (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage), and 2 were
B/Bangladesh/3333/2007-like (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage). Based on the
genetic characterization of 550 influenza viruses, 160 belonged to the
pandemic A/California/7/2009 A(H1N1) clade; 10 belonged to the
pandemic A/Christchurch/16/2010 A(H1) clade; 46 belonged to the
pandemic A/Hong Kong/2213/2010 A(H1) clade; 124 belonged to the
recently emerged A/England/142/2010 subgroup characterized by S185T
substitution in the HA; 12 belonged to the A(H3) clade represented by
A/Perth/16/2009; 7 belonged to the A(H3) clade represented by
A/Victoria/208/2009; 30 belonged to the subgroup represented by A/Hong
Kong/2121/2010 in the A/Victoria/208/2009 A(H3) clade; 19 belonged to
the B/Bangladesh/3333/2007 clade (Yamagata lineage); and 142 to the
B/Brisbane/60/2008 clade (Victoria lineage).

Since week 40/2010, 9 countries (Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Italy,
Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, and the UK) have screened
2407 viruses for susceptibility to the neuraminidase inhibitors
oseltamivir and zanamivir. The UK analysed most of the viruses
screened (1672). Out of the 2069 pandemic A(H1N1) 2009 viruses that
were tested, 1978 were sensitive to both inhibitors and 91 viruses
(4.4 percent) carried the NA H275Y mutation. These 91 viruses were
resistant to oseltamivir but remained sensitive to zanamivir. 4
influenza A(H3N2) viruses were tested and found to be sensitive to
both inhibitors. All of the 338 influenza B viruses tested for
susceptibility to oseltamivir and the 328 tested for susceptibility to
zanamivir were found to be sensitive. All 178 pandemic influenza
A(H1N1) 2009 viruses and 2 A(H3N2) viruses that were screened for
susceptibility to adamantanes were found to be resistant.

Comment
-------
Trends in clinical and virological data suggest that influenza
activity is substantially declining across the WHO European Region.
Recent declines in clinical indicators have been observed in nearly
all countries, and many are below seasonal thresholds for influenza
activity. The percent of sentinel ILI, ARI, and SARI specimens that
have tested positive for influenza, and the circulation of pandemic
influenza A(H1N1) 2009 relative to influenza B has also declined
during recent weeks.

[The EuroFlu website features an interactive map presenting
qualitative indicators of influenza activity (intensity, trend,
geographical spread, and impact) and the dominant virus as assessed by
each of the countries. This information can be accessed by clicking on
the individual countries in the map and readers are recommended to
make use of this facility. In addition, clicking on France, the
Russian Federation, Turkey, and UK (England) will provide regional
data for these countries.

Interestingly the cumulative data for the winter season (weeks
40/2010-13/2011) reveal that only just over one quarter of the cases
of severe acute respiratory illness could be attributed to influenza
virus infection. - Mod.CP]
