[Concerning the additional information in this post about gummy stem blight]

.....you mention that "The fungus is seed-borne" when, in fact, this
fungus CAN be seed-borne, but its spores may also be airborne or
water-borne. Insects can spread the spores as well as irrigation
water. This pathogen [of gummy stem blight of watermelon, that is,
the fungus _Didymella bryoniae_] can carry over from growing season
to growing season in an over-wintering structure as well. Wild
cucurbits or volunteer hosts from previous crops can also play roles
in allowing the pathogen to live in an area that is free of an
agronomic crop until new plantings of cucurbits become available.

[There are] seed producers who make every attempt to insure that this
fungus is not transmitted by their product.
