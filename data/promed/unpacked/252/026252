Japan confirms 9th mad cow case, 2nd in a month
-----------------------------------------------
Japan said on Tuesday that it had confirmed another case of bovine
spongiform encephalitis (BSE), the 9th since the illness was discovered in
the country in September 2001 and the 2nd in less than a month. Health
Ministry officials said the disease was found in a 21 month old Holstein
bull in Hiroshima prefecture, western Japan.
In early October 2003, officials said that atypical BSE had been diagnosed
in a 23 month old Holstein bull. That case was the first since January. The
new case involves an animal born in January 2002 in Hyogo prefecture,
western Japan, and sent to Hiroshima a month later. Ministry officials said
the internal organs of the Holstein bull, which was slaughtered on 29 Oct
2003, would be incinerated.
They said the 9th case had a similar form to the first 7 cases. It was the
2nd case to be confirmed in Japan in an animal less than 2 years old, as
the disease has a long incubation period of 2 to 8 years.
Although BSE has been discovered before in cows of under 2 years, many
scientists believe young animals and boneless cuts of meat are unlikely to
contain the abnormal proteins. The first 7 cows confirmed with the disease
in Japan were all more than 5 years old.
MBM FEED
Experts are puzzled as to how the infection occurred, since the latest 2
animals were born after Japan banned the use of meat-and-bone meal (MBM)
feed in October 2001. Experts consider the feed the most likely route for
the infections that occurred in Japan. Japan imposed a ban on the import,
sale, and use of MBM as feed a month after it confirmed its first case of
BSE, which was also Asia's first. Investigators have long linked the
disease to MBM made from the bones and parts of infected cows.
In late September 2003, a panel of ministry experts said in a report that
the most likely source of Japan's BSE outbreaks was either cows imported
from Britain in the 1980s or contaminated MBM from Italy.
BSE has been linked to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which has killed
about 130 people in Europe. There have been no reports of people being
affected by the human form of the disease in Japan.
The first few cases of BSE rocked Japan's food sector, hit earnings of
restaurants and meat packers, and shook public faith in food safety
standards. But public confidence in the meat industry and beef consumption
has recently started to recover. The Health Ministry has been carrying out
BSE tests on all cattle for human consumption since October 2001. Officials
have said the latest cases confirm the effectiveness of the safety checks.
