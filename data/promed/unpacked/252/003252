[Sweden has implemented an extensive program of surveillance for
Echinococosis (Hydatid Disease). They found and reported the presence
of subclinical disease in 2010 and this report appears to reflect a
similar set of circumstances. According to the OIE WAHID database,
both Finland and Russia have reported clinical and subclinical disease
while Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Denmark have not reported the
disease since 2008. Many other European countries have reported this
disease on an infrequent basis over the last several years.

The location of the case in the central part of Sweden can be seen
appended to the OIE report referenced above or at the Healthmap
website. - Mod.PC
