Today I spoke with Bob Scoelkopf, D/Marine Mammal Stranding Center in
Brigantine, NJ (telophone: 609-266-0538), who kindly shared some
information with me.
While their normal success rate for beached seals is >85%, it has become
very much the reverse recently. For example, of nine Hooded Seals recently
brought in, only two have survived and one of these is doing well enough for
them to consider scheduling its release. Tissue from the dead seals has been
sent to Tom Lipscomb, Path Dept., Armed Forces Institute, for study and his
report is awaited.
The seals were found with pneumonia. When found they are lethargic, look
robust but are in the lower half (65-70 lbs) of their expected weight range
for age (two year olds). Of the seven dead Hooded seals, only one had rocks
in its stomach indicating starvation. When found these animals are highly
stressed. The response to antibiotics has been poor.
In 1988 they first started to see arctic seals, Harp & Hooded seals, in New
Jersey during the winter months. This is now the norm. They are frequently
young animals. His belief is that they form an indicator group reflecting
the depleted fish stocks in the Arctic. He holds that this is a direct
result of commercial over fishing. Unable to compete with the adult seals for
the limited stocks of fish, the youngsters come 1,500 to 2,000 miles south
in hopes of finding fish.
He stated that beached sick seals in New England & Maine should not be taken
back out to sea, which they would do on their own if they were fit, but
should be checked as to any obvious causes and got back in health, if
possible; more information as to seal health & disease is needed. The latter
care is not cheap nor simple. For example, his privately supported center
has a maximum capacity to look after nine seals at any one time and they
cost $120/day to feed and house.
Though we only spoke on the phone, Bob struck me as someone who is
knowledgeable in his field, a realist, and responsible. USDA licenses to run
a stranding center are not given lightly. He deserves all the help he can get.
