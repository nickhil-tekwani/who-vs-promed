Occurrence of target leaf spot disease caused by _Corynespora cassicola_
on cucumber in Korea

This is the first report of target leaf spot of cucumber (_Cucumis
sativus_) grown in open fields, caused by _Corynespora cassicola_, in
Chonnam province of Korea. A similar disease caused by _Corynespora
melonis_[Cc] was observed in 1991 in greenhouse-cultivated cucumber in the
Jinju area of Korea (Kang et al., 1993).

Surveys of commercial fields between 2000 and 2001 in Chonnam province,
revealed severe damage on the Japanese cucumber variety, Baeksung 3, but
not on Korean varieties. By 2002 these varieties were severely affected by
target leaf spot in fields in Chonnam and Gyeongnam provinces.

Leaf symptoms began as small brown spots with yellow halos, enlarging and
becoming irregularly shaped before defoliation occurred. The morphology of
the fungus consistently obtained from these infected spots matched the
description of Cc (Ellis & Holliday, 1971). Conidiophores were erect and
simple, pale to mid-brown, 205-725 micrometers long, and 5-8 micrometers
wide. Conidia were formed singly or in chains, obclavate to cylindrical,
straight or curved, subhyaline to pale olivaceous-brown, 22-300 micrometers
long and 5-10 micrometers wide at the base, with 7 - 11 pseudosepta.

Identical 610-bp PCR products were obtained using primers to amplify
internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of the 18S rRNA regions from the new
Korean isolates and a reference strain ATCC64204 of Cc (Wyszogrodzka et
al., 1987).

A conidial suspension (10 000 conidia per ml) of Cc was prepared from
3-week-old cultures grown on PDA and sprayed on cucumber plants with
completely developed third leaves. After incubation in a dew chamber for 24
hours at 30 deg C, plants were maintained at 25 deg C. Small brown spots
appeared on leaves within 3 days. Leaves of water-sprayed control plants
remained healthy.

Cc was re-isolated from leaf lesions and was identical morphologically to
the original Cc isolate sprayed on test plants. Greenhouse studies
indicated that a long dew period and high temperatures (25-30 deg C)
increase disease severity.

An isolate of Cc has been deposited in the Korean Agricultural Culture
Collection (KACC40941).

[Cc has a wide natural host range, including tomato and papaya. It may
survive up to 2 years in crop debris, thus providing inoculum for continued
spread. Cc strains from different hosts have been found often but are not
always able to cross-infect other hosts. It is seedborne in soybean, but
little is known about its survival in seeds of other crops. The primary
means of field spread is by wind-blown conidia. Greatest disease severity
from Cc appears to occur in seasonal periods when the temperature is
approximately 28 deg C. Plant resistance has been used to control target
spot in European cucumber crops for many years. Resistance to Cc has also
been documented in soybean and tomato. The disease is controlled primarily
by periodic applications of protectant fungicides.
