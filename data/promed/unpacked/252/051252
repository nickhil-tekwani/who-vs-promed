Recently the alarm was raised in the Samara region of central Russia where a
50-year-old died and 177 people were infected by a virus that causes fatal
internal bleeding.
The GLPS virus, which causes internal hemorrhaging and also affects the
kidneys, is transmitted by mice. The virus is not rare and in Russia claims
its toll every year, said Galina Fyodorova Lazinova, one of the heads of
Russia's epidemiology studies.
But doctors in the Samara region were not so calm, saying on NTV television
that they feared there would be more victims if they were not given a
recently-developed vaccine.
The vaccine, although effective, must still be tested in the laboratory, but
it would cost the health ministry $20 million to do that, which it can
hardly afford.
Lazinova said that in the meantime, Samara health services had found a way
of fighting the disease -- by killing off the mice [which carry it. In the
meantime, close to 180 people are waiting in the area, suffering from
flu-like symptoms, aches and pains and debility.
If they are not treated, victims die from internal bleeding after the virus
has attacked their blood vessels.
NTV television presented GLPS as one of those mysterious diseases that
frequently strike Russia. In July 1999, the people of three southern
regions -- Rostov, Stavropol and Volgograd -- were panicked after a mystery
virus killed 10 people and caused the hospitalization of 174 others.
To blame was the Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever virus, spread by ticks,
which causes high fever and hemorrhages. In August 1999, 80 people were
taken to hospital with similar symptoms in Bashkirya, in the Urals.
A total of 140 caught an "unknown virus" in June, near Tula, south of
Moscow, while another 200 were laid low in Tatarstan at the end of August.
Most of the time confusion about the causes and detail of the mass illnesses
can be explained by poor diagnoses, with provincial doctors lacking the
means to carry out serious analyses.
