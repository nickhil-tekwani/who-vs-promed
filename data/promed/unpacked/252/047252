The 1st case of human anthrax has been detected in Kurigram [Rangpur
division] on the same day that the government withdrew a red alert
supposedly reassured that its spread had been contained. SB, 25, wife
of SI of Dhananjoy village under Omar Majid Union of Rajarhat Upazila
[subdistrict], was diagnosed to have contracted anthrax on Thursday
[7 Oct 2010].

The district civil surgeon, Dr Golam Mostafa, formed a 3-member
medical board to detect and treat more anthrax patients, if there
were any. The medical board also gave necessary treatment to SB. Dr
Mostafa told reporters it was the 1st case of anthrax in the district
and, "The district health officials were kept on highest alert. There
is nothing to panic. We have sufficient vaccines in stock." [I think
he means antibiotics. - Mod.MHJ]

SB, who is also pregnant, visited the Omar Majid Union Health Centre
on Monday [4 Oct 2010] to treat infections on her legs. The duty
doctor Belal Hossain sent her to Rajarhat Upazila Health Complex
suspecting her to be infected with anthrax. Subsequently she was sent
to Kurigram Sadar Hospital for further treatment. Medical board
member Dr Ajoy said that the patient was out of danger.

SB said that 10 days ago symptoms of infection were found on her legs
after she consumed beef that her husband had bought from Forkerhat
Bazar in Kurigram.

The government on 5 Sep 2010 issued a red alert across the country
alarmed by the spread of anthrax but withdrew it on Thursday [7 Oct
2010] claiming that the situation was under control.

[Because of the nature of exposure cutaneous anthrax lesions are
normally on the hands, wrists, and forearms, then on the face (from
scratching) and neck (contaminated scarf or from carrying infected
dry hides). Legs, plural, are unusual. The only likely explanation I
can think of is that the blood from the infected meat dripped off the
edge of a kitchen table while she was leaning forward. If it was from
scratching an itch it would be more likely to be just one leg, not
both. - Mod.MHJ]

Emboldened by the halt in anthrax spread, the government is likely to
lift the red alert on Thursday [7th Oct], which was issued last month
[September 2010] by the livestock department to combat the disease.
Fisheries and livestock minister Abdul Latif Biswas told bdnews24.com
on Wednesday [6 Oct 2010]: "The red alert may be lifted through a
press conference on Thursday [7 Oct 2010] morning."

At the same time, investigations have been launched against certain
vested interest groups suspected of scaremongering to hike poultry
prices. [See [4]]. The minister alleged that the negative publicity
regarding anthrax was in reality a conspiracy, saying, "Anthrax is
not something to be overly worried over. It is a recurring phenomenon
and each year a lot of cattle and birds are killed by the disease.
But no one really bothered about it because there was no media
coverage in the past," he said, adding, "this time, though, a vested
quarter had tried to benefit from the scare by publicizing it."

The minister went on to draw a comparison of the anthrax spread this
year [2010] with previous years, saying, "In 2008, 437 cows were
affected by anthrax and 156 died. In 2009, 449 were affected and 114
died. This year [2010], until now, only 104 cows have been infected
of which 37 died. Another 11 cows were culled."

He also compared the anthrax toll in cows with other diseases like
Badla [?shipping fever], Khura (local term for foot-and-mouth
disease) and peste des petits ruminants (PPR).

In 2008, 945 cows out of 1346 infected by Badla [shipping fever], 203
cows out of 32 701 infected by Khura [FMD], and 1843 out of 36 842
infected with PPR died.

In 2009, 611 cows out of 1123 infected by Badla [shipping fever],
6020 cows out of around 2.5 lakhs [250 000] infected by Khura [FMD],
and 3491 of out 53 519 infected with PPR died.

In the current year [2010], until now, 89 out of 237 affected by
Badla [shipping fever], 83 out of 4135 affected by Khura [FMD], and
231 out of 4359 infected by PPR have died.

"The negative publicity this year [2010] was a deliberate attempt to
frighten the people. It was publicised that all livestock including
cows, goats, ducks, and birds were infected by this disease. However,
there were no reports of any hens [or other birds] being affected.
This was done to reap benefits."

"No report of anthrax infection among livestock has reached us from
middle of last month [September 2010]. So we have decided to withdraw
the red alert as it is hampering other works of the ministry," he added.

[Checking the OIE data for FMD and Bangladesh it has been a chronic
problem since 1996, which is not cheering nor indicative of
government efficiency at disease control. These anthrax case numbers
for 2008 and 2009 are of interest as Bangladesh has not reported
anything of value on this disease to OIE since 1996, except that 3
843 590 cattle were vaccinated in 2007 and more than 1.8 million in
2008; over 129 500 small ruminants were vaccinated in 2008. If these
case figures are anything to go by they normally see some 400-500
bovine cases a year and an unknown number of sheep and goats
affected. At this time it is hard to say what tipped the human side
of the epidemiologic equation for 607 human cases to emerge. However
until it is clarified it is always fun to blame others besides the
press, so check out the following report from Dhaka. - Mod.MHJ]

The anthrax scare is nothing but propaganda of 7 organisations of the
poultry traders, the livestock minister has claimed. After a meeting
with the meat and dairy traders at the Secretariat on [Sun 3 Oct
2010], minister Abdul Latif Biswas said intelligence reports reveal
that those organisations of poultry owners, which he did not name,
were involved in spreading such panic. "We're considering measures
against [them]," he said.

The minister's comments came after repeated protests and demands by
the meat traders around the country, who had been identifying that
some vested quarters were conspiring over the anthrax issue and were
taking advantage.

The minister also said since the beginning of anthrax [epidemic] 48
cows and 56 goats died, and more than 500 people were affected by the
disease. He also pointed out that no new anthrax-infected cattle had
been identified since [18 Sep 2010].

However, Institute of Epidemiology, Diseases Control and Research
(IEDCR) website states that 607 cases have been detected across the
country until [Sat 2 Oct 2010].
