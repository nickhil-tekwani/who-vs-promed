The health ministry has contained the meningitis outbreak in the country.
"We are on top of the situation. No new cases have been reported since 28
Jan [2009]," said Dr Sam Zaramba, the director general of health services.
He said there was increased awareness about the disease in the affected
areas, which saw many people receive treatment and vaccination.

The outbreak hit the country in December [2008]. Uganda is one of the
countries in the African meningitis belt. The epidemic that started in
Hoima and Arua districts also spread to Masindi, Adjumani and Moyo. By 3
Feb 2009, 336 people had been affected, while 42 had died.

Last month [January 2009], the ministry delivered drugs and financial
support to the affected areas. Dr Nathan Kenya Mugisha, the director for
clinical services, said the ministry and the World Health Organization had
vaccinated people aged between 2 and 30 years in the affected districts.
"This age group is more vulnerable to meningitis and our assessment teams
continue doing their work. We have also advised people to avoid congestion
especially in the affected districts," Mugisha said. "We allowed the
schools in the affected districts to open for the new academic year because
our assessment teams have reported no new cases. This is also one of the
signs that we are managing the epidemic," he added.

Meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges, the lining surrounding the
brain and spinal cord. The disease is caused by bacteria and is transmitted
through contact with the respiratory or throat secretions from an infected
person.

Last year [2008], the country also suffered cholera, botulism, Ebola,
Marburg, typhoid, measles, and hepatitis E outbreaks. While presenting the
status report on major disease outbreaks to Parliament last week [9-13 Feb
2009], health state minister Richard Nduhura said all the diseases had been
controlled, save for hepatitis E.

[It is heartening to hear that the meningococcal meningitis epidemic in
Uganda has waned. Controlling meningitis epidemics consists of early
detection of clinical cases, prompt case management, limiting social
gatherings -- for example, by closing schools in an attempt to diminish
transmission of _Neisseria meningitidis_, and meningococcal vaccination of
the people living in the epidemic area.

Meningococcal meningitis epidemics in the "African meningitis belt" when
studied in Mali usually begin soon after the onset of dusty dry weather,
diminish about 8 weeks later and end on average about another 8 weeks later
(<http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020006>).
Similar meningococcal meningitis epidemic curves were found in 2006 in
Gulu, Uganda
(<http://www.who.int/hac/crises/uga/sitreps/Gulu%20Meningitis%20Report_7th%20March.pdf>),
and now in the current Ugandan epidemic, which the above news report says
began in December 2008.
