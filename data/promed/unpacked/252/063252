Disease scare on Turkey's border
--------------------------------
The article reports massive spread of lumpy skin disease [LSD] in cattle in the Turkish provinces bordering Syria, causing serious economic losses predominantly in Osmaniye, Adana and Kahramanmaras. The disease is being repeatedly introduced with infected cattle from Syria crossing the "porous", "leaking" border and is locally spread by flies. The vaccine applied by the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock is said to be a sheep and goat pox vaccine. The disease does not affect human health. Meat prices have risen.

[Turkey's most recent follow-up report (no 17) on their LSD situation was submitted to the OIE on 18 Apr 2014, reporting 24 new outbreaks. For the locations of the 60 outbreaks reported in Turkey since the start of the epizootic, on 6 Aug 2013, please refer to OIE's interactive map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=14106.

With temperatures rising, a further spread of the disease may be expected, in Turkey as well as in other parts of the Middle East. Since late 2012, the disease has been spreading in several countries bordering Syria, in addition to Turkey, including Israel, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, and the Palestinian Authority. LSD has been endemic in Egypt for several decades. Syria has not reported the disease.

Details on the efficacy of the vaccination in Turkey would be helpful. - Mod.AS
