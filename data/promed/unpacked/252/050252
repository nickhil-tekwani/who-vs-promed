Medical officials in Kibaale district have registered 2 new suspected Ebola virus disease cases. A 24-year-old woman and her 4-year child were admitted to Kagadi Hospital isolation ward on Sunday [2 Sep 2012] afternoon with clinical symptoms similar to those of Ebola disease. "They are admitted in an isolation ward at the hospital. They have received medication and they are stable," the district health officer Dr Dan Kyamanywa told this newspaper on Tuesday [4 Sep 2012]. He says medical experts then carried out investigations to establish whether they had come into contact with an Ebola patient. "They do not have that history," Dr Kyamanywa said.

The patients are residents of Kabuga LCI [local council I], Nyamacumu parish in Muhorro sub-county. Dr Kyamanywa says the 2 had fever, and were vomiting as well as passing blood. "We extracted a blood sample from them and sent it to the Uganda Virus Research Institute for testing," Kyamanywa added. The results had not been returned by press time.

The suspected cases come within the period health authorities say must elapse before the district is declared Ebola disease free. The incubation period for Ebola is around 21 days, and the district can only be declared Ebola disease free if no new case is reported after that period. The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Monday [3 Sep 22012] said the outbreak could be coming to an end since no new confirmed cases have been reported since 3 Aug 2012. The WHO stressed Monday [3 Sep 2012] that all probable and confirmed cases had been monitored for 21 days or more, adding that "the last confirmed case was discharged on 24 Aug 2012 ... following recovery".

[Hopefully the hospitalisation of the mother and child suspected to have contracted Ebola virus disease is merely a consequence of enhanced surveillance in the Kibaale District. The result of the diagnostic tests underway in Entebbe is awaited.
