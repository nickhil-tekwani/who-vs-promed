A 61-year-old woman from Rhodope, northern Greece, who died last
Tuesday [19 Aug 2008] after suffering a high fever, had been bitten
by a tick carrying a [virus] that also led to the death of a
[46-year-old woman from Alexandroupolis -- also in Rhodope -- at the
end of June 2008], doctors said yesterday [22 Aug 2008]. The Rhodope
woman had been admitted to the hospital 3 times this month [August
2008] after suffering from insomnia, a heavy cough and high fever,
but had not told doctors about the tick bite. Doctors determined that
the woman had been infected by Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF)
[virus] once they had been told about the bite by the victim's relative.

[This 2nd confirmed case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in Greece
is also the 2nd death. Sequence analysis of a portion of the genome
of virus from the 1st patient has shown that the causative virus
strain is similar to other strains detected or isolated in the Balkan
Peninsula (Albania, Bulgaria, and Kosovo), Russia, and Turkey, which
have been associated with severe, and sometimes fatal, disease in
humans. The strain identified in Greece was similar to those found in
the Balkan Peninsula, Russia, and Turkey, but differed greatly from a
Greek strain AP92, isolated from ticks in 1976, which may have caused
inapparent infections in humans.

During March and April 2008, 6 probable CCHF cases have been reported
in a known endemic area in Bulgaria, close to the border with Greece.
In addition, many CCHF cases have been reported in Turkey this year
(2008), but none of them in the European part of the country.

For a more detailed account of the 1st case in Greece, see
A Papa et al: A recent case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in
Greece, June 2008. Eurosurveillance 13(33); 14 Aug 2008, available at
<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=18952>.

Subsequent to the death of the woman in Alexandroupolis, residents
throughout Rhodope and the neighbouring prefectures of Drama, Kavala,
Xanthi, and Evros were informed about measures for tick bite
prevention and about the importance to refer as soon as possible to
the closest hospital or general practitioner for tick removal. At the
same time guidelines were disseminated to health-care workers for
proper removal of attached ticks. Tragically, the 2nd victim seems to
have escaped this surveillance by failing to disclose a tick bite.
