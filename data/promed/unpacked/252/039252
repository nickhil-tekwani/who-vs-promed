Hundreds of giant squid wash up dead on beach in Washington state
-----------------------------------------------
When hundreds of giant squid washed up dead on the Long Beach Peninsula
last weekend, Dean Marsh knew exactly what to do: he stocked his freezer.
"No sense letting them go to waste," said the 57-year-old bait salesman,
who planned to cut them up and sell them to fishermen.
An estimated 1000 to 1500 Humboldt jumbo flying squid -- typically found
off the coast of Mexico -- have washed up on southwest Washington beaches
in the past few days, said Greg Bargmann, a marine fish manager with the
state Fish and Wildlife Department. What's killing them isn't clear.
"They're like salmon: They spawn and then they die," Bargmann said. "I
don't know if this is post-spawning, or if the waters got so cold they
couldn't take it anymore."
Tuna fishermen 1st reported seeing the squid about 30 miles off the
southwest Washington coast in August 2004. At the time, the ocean water was
significantly warmer than usual, 67 F, instead of 50 to 55 F.
Ever since, the squid have surprised anglers as far north as Sitka, Alaska.
One salmon fisherman in British Columbia hauled in a 6 1/2-foot,
44-pound squid this month, a specimen that's now in a formaldehyde tank at
the Royal British Columbia Museum.
"I've talked to some knowledgeable people who have lived on the coast for a
long time, and they've never seen anything like this," Bargmann said. "We
don't know what's causing it, but it sure is interesting.

Jumbo flying squid found off Alaska is 1st of the species recovered from
British Columbia waters
-----------------------------------------------
A large Humboldt squid caught offshore from Sitka is among numerous
sightings of a species seen for the 1st time in waters of the Far North,
and the 1st of the species recovered from British Columbia waters.
The 5-foot _Dosidicus gigas_, or jumbo flying squid, was shipped this week
to California to be kept for research at the Santa Barbara Museum of
Natural History.
The squid was one of a number caught with a dip net by fisherman Alan
Otness and his crew on 18 Sep 2004, as they baited longline gear at night.
They brought back some of the creatures for examination by experts.
Eric Hochburg, curator of the Santa Barbara museum, said the species is
usually found off Baja, California and farther south.
The farthest north the species has been reported until this year [2004] was
off the central Oregon Coast in 1997, said James A. Cosgrove, manager of
natural history at the Royal British Columbia Museum. Before that year, the
farthest north it was seen was near San Francisco, he said. Until this
summer, there have been no other sightings in the north, Cosgrove said.
"It's unprecedented," he said. "It speaks of a fundamental change in the
ocean along the coast."
The museum is keeping a 6 1/2-foot, 44-pound _Dosidicus gigas_ in a
formaldehyde tank. The purple-bodied cephalopod with 8 sucker-covered arms
and 2 curly tentacles was caught on 2 Oct 2004.
Since news of that discovery was made public, Cosgrove has received 7
reports of sightings since late July 2004 of jumbo squid in northwest
waters from Oregon to Alaska. Beside the Sitka catch, the squid were
spotted near Yakutat and Kodiak Island.
"We'll try to get a handle on are they moving north with warmer waters, and
then do they die out as they head north, or does the cold water constrain
their northward movement?" Hochburg said.

that this may be part of normal behavior, perhaps stemming from changes
within the ocean that are affecting these creatures. - Mod.TG]
