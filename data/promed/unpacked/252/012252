Epidemic among cattle
---------------------
The bovine population of a village under Mahakalpada block here is
under threat by a mysterious disease. As many as 32 buffaloes have
perished since last week in Bajrabahakuda village while several
people are battling to save their buffaloes from the deadly disease.

Veterinary experts who rushed to the village yesterday suspect that
the sick bovines have come under the grip of suspected foot
and mouth disease.

"Things have assumed epidemic proportion with air-borne viral disease
spreading fast. Majority of buffaloes have got infected. Incidentally
farmers have stayed away from rearing cows in the village," said
veterinary surgeons who examined the sick animals.

The whole of the cattle population has now been covered under a
vaccination drive. Hopefully, the disease and death will come to an
end soon, said veterinary officials.

The remote village is home to nearly 200 cattle farmers. Besides
cattle farming, fishing and crop cultivation are alternate livelihood
sources of natives of the disease-hit village. "The cattle-death-spree
has imperilled the economy of the village, as cattle farmers who
supply their milk to neighbouring Paradip town had attained a degree
of self-sufficiency," said Mr. Bijoy Shukla, sarpanch [chairperson] of
Ramnagar Gram Panchayat [elected village council].

"With marine fishing no more a viable income source in view of a
7-month-long prohibition, many fishermen had taken to cattle farming.
With buffaloes dying en masse, the economic backbone of the village has
been hit hard," he observed.

[The affected village is situated within the Kendrapara District, an
administrative district of Orissa state in eastern India; see map at
<http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/orissa/districts/kendrapara.htm>.

Though buffaloes are susceptible to FMD infection, this virus will
not kill adult animals at a rate higher than 5 percent, and in most
cases lower. It would help if the denominator was known, namely the
total number of large and small ruminants, including buffaloes, in
the village, their vaccination history, their age distribution, and
the age of affected/dead animals. Without laboratory investigation,
final diagnosis is practically unachievable.

Mass mortality in buffaloes can, obviously, be caused by other
disease agents, infectious or toxic. One of the disease agents which
is known to be involved in such situations in the Indian subcontinent
and South-East Asia is the bacterium _Pasteurella multocida_, the
causative agent of haemorrhagic septicaemia. Final epidemiological
and laboratory results are requested. - Mod.AS]

[Undiagnosed human cases are occurring in the same district, which may
or may not be related -- see another of today's ProMED posts. But
foot-&-mouth disease of livestock does not affect humans. - Mod.JW]
