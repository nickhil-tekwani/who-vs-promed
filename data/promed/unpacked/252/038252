[According to a Cambodian media report dated 22 May 2018, about 150 head of cattle and buffaloes were affected by a disease named "cow pox", of which 50 died, in 2 communes in the Steng Treng province in Cambodia. Promed-Mail's requested FAO's assistance in checking the validity/accuracy of the said data. The following response has been kindly sent. - Mod.AS]

As checked with POAHP [Provincial Office of Animal Health and Production], Steung Treng, there is no big outbreak in the described areas. The district veterinary collaborates with local authorities organising routine HS [Hemorrhagic septicemia, Pasteurellosis] vaccination campaign in the area, and has not received any information about the incidence. Several animals died in April or early May [2018] but the owner was not aware of that because the animals are at free range in the forest. HS is suspected, not cowpox. The reporters may have used the term "cowpox" in their English translation since in the Khmer language the term 'FMD' can be confused with 'pox'.

A similar event was reported last year but the veterinary team which reached the location found that there had been some deaths in the forest but no clinical case could be traced.

[The Phnom Penh Post report dated 22 May 2018 (at https://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/cowpox-kills-cattle-steng-treng) said:

"Nearly 50 bulls and buffaloes have died from cowpox while 100 others have the disease in Prek Meas and Thmor Key communes in Siam district, Steng Treng province, according to local authorities".

ProMED-mail's commentary indicated that the term "Cowpox" used in the report "is, most likely, erroneous. Cowpox is definitely not regarded a lethal disease. Professionally-confirmed diagnosis, preferably laboratory-backed, of the described mortality and illness in cattle and buffaloes is anticipated soon".

We are gratefully indebted to our FAO colleagues for their speedy clarification. - Mod.AS
