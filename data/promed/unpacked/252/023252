EPPO ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTATION SERVICE
=======================================
Date: Fri, 14 Jun 1996 08:49:00 -0700 (PDT)
From: p.anderson@cgnet.com (Pamela Anderson)

The European Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) has announced
that the EPPO Reporting Service is now available in electronic
form. To receive instructions, you should send to:
mail-server@eppo.fr
the message: SEND instructions
The texts and summaries of phytosanitary regulations will appear
every month. They are also distributed to the Plant Protection
Services of EPPO member governments. They will eventually be
compiled into a book which will be available for sale. But, for
the moment, they are generally available only from the EPPO
mailserver.
