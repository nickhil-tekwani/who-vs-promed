A 7-month-old baby was rushed to the Dr Slamet [hospital] in
Kabupaten Garut, West Java early on Sat 26 Feb 2011 and was treated in
a bird flu isolation unit. The baby had developed coughing, fever and
breathing difficulty.

Hundreds of chickens [were reported] to have died suddenly as a
result of bird flu [avian (A/(H5N1) influenza virus infection] in the
patient's neighborhood (Kampung Cangkuang, Desa Bagendit, Kecamatan
Banyuresmi). The baby is reported to have had contact with the
diseased chickens.

The Head of the Livestock Division of Kecamatan Banyuresmi also is
being treated in the same hospital as a bird flu suspect patient.

They both are receiving intensive medical care. Nose and throat swab
samples have been sent to the Ministry of Health Laboratory in
Jakarta.

Avian influenza (A/H5N1) has spread to 5 sub-districts (Kecamatan) in
Banyuresmi. It has not only killed about 1000 birds [but] also may
have infected a human and put about 5000 people at risk.

Head of Livestock Service, Hermanto, said the 5 affected villages
were Desa Karyasari, Banyuresi, Sukaratu, Sukamukti and Bagendit.

The Livestock Service is attempting to [carry out] massive culling as
instructed by the provincial government.

Meanwhile, the 49-year-old Head of the Livestock Division of
Kecamatan Banyuresmi is being treated in the Dr Slamet hospital as a
bird flu suspect. The patient is a resident of Perum Cempaka Indah RT
02 RW 16, Kelurahan Lebak Jaya, Kecamatan Karangpawitan, Kabupaten
Garut. She had a temperature of 38.6 C with indication of leukopenia.
As an officer, she has responsibility to manage diseased birds in the
field.

The patient's daughter reported that her mother developed fever and
breathing difficulty on Thu 24 Feb 2011 at 6 pm. Her condition did not
improve so her family took her to the Dr Slamet hospital in Garut,
where she was then isolated. An isolation unit paramedic said the
patient had been treated with Tamiflu, antibiotics, vaccine [?] and
oxygen. Currently, her temperature has fallen to 36 C, but she is
still receiving oxygen for her breathing problems.

The hospital has sent nasal and throat swabs, a chest x-ray
photograph and blood sample from the patient to the laboratory of the
Ministry of Health in Jakarta, said a doctor in the Bird Flu Control
Unit of Dr Slamet hospital. The patient is a mother of 2.

Spokesman of the local Health Service Dede Rohmansyah said about 5000
people are at risk of H5N1 infection. A total 1673 people are under
intensive monitoring, and 163 are under investigation.

Health Service and local health workers are now investigating any
influenza-like illness (ILI) and H5N1 suspects.
