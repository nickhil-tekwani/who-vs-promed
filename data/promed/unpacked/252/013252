[Newcastle disease (ND) is caused by virulent strains of avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1) of the genus _Avulavirus_ belonging to the family Paramyxoviridae. There are 10 serotypes of avian paramyxoviruses designated APMV-I to APMV-10.

The vast majority of bird species appear to be susceptible to infection with APMV-1 of both high and low virulence for chickens, although the clinical signs seen in infected birds vary widely and are dependent on factors such as the virus, host species, age of host, infection with other organisms, environmental stress, and immune status. In some circumstances, infection with the extremely virulent viruses may result in sudden high mortality with comparatively few clinical signs. Thus, the clinical signs are variable and influenced by other factors so that none can be regarded as pathognomonic.

Even for susceptible hosts, ND viruses produce a considerable range of clinical signs. Generally, variation consists of clusters around the two extremes in the ICPI test, but, for a variety of reasons, some viruses may show intermediate virulence. The broad variation in virulence and clinical signs necessitates the careful definition of what constitutes ND for the purposes of trade, control measures, and policies. The definition of ND currently in use in all member states of the European Union is defined in Directive 92/66/EEC of the Commission for European Communities.

The OIE definition for reporting an outbreak of ND is as follows:

Newcastle disease is defined as an infection of poultry caused by a virus of avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (APMV-1) that meets one of the following criteria for virulence:

a) The virus has an intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) in day-old chicks (_Gallus gallus_) of 0.7 or greater.
or
b) Multiple basic amino acids have been demonstrated in the virus (either directly or by deduction) at the C-terminus of the F2 protein and phenylalanine at residue 117, which is the N-terminus of the F1 protein. The term "multiple basic amino acids" refers to at least 3 arginine or lysine residues between residues 113 and 116. Failure to demonstrate the characteristic pattern of amino acid residues as described above would require characterisation of the isolated virus by an ICPI test.

In this definition, amino acid residues are numbered from the N-terminus of the amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the F0 gene; 113-116 corresponds to residues -4 to -1 from the cleavage site.

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2018, chapter 2.3.14 Newcastle disease (version adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2012); http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.14_NEWCASTLE_DIS.pdf. - Mod.CRD
