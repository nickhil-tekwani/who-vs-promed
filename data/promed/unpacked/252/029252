The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) just came out with strict new recommendations on screening for the parasite causing the tick-borne infection babesiosis. Medical screening has always been part of the blood donation process, but this month [May 2019] a new recommendation from the FDA includes wholesale testing of donor samples in certain areas of the country for the tick-borne infection babesiosis.

Dr. Steven Sloan is the medical director of the blood bank at Boston Children's Hospital, where they've been testing blood donations for _Babesia_ the past few years -- with good reason. "It is the disease that has caused the most transfusion-transmitted fatalities in the US over the last decade," Dr. Sloan explained.

The FDA report notes that of the 200 known cases of babesiosis from blood transfusions, 95% came from 14 states and the District of Columbia. Those states include all 6 in New England.

The report recommends updating health questionnaires in the most-affected states. "So if a sample tests positive, the 1st thing is we do not use that blood for any patients. That blood will be discarded," Sloan said.

Donors testing positive would be deferred from further donation for 2 years.

Although the FDA report makes clear that it is recommending _Babesia_ testing -- not requiring it -- Sloan predicts every blood supplier will get on board in time. "So, it will probably be another year before most places will be testing for _Babesia_ in this part of the country," Sloan said. And yes, that could mean more cases of transfusion-caused babesiosis. But Sloan says with one positive in every few thousand donations, the risk is still small.

[_Babesia microti_ is a single-cell protozoan parasite transmitted from white-footed mice and other small mammals to humans by ticks. Most cases in the USA occur in the Northeast and upper Midwest, particularly in parts of New England, New York state, New Jersey, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. In the Northeast, babesiosis occurs in both inland and coastal areas, including off-shore islands, such as Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard (Massachusetts), Block Island (Rhode Island), and Shelter Island, Fire Island, and eastern Long Island (New York state) (https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/babesiosis/gen_info/faqs.html).
