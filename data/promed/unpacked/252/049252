Canadian pork producers are worried about a virus that is killing young pigs in the United States. An outbreak of porcine epidemic diarrhea has affected herds in 22 American states. Pork producers say this could open the US market to more Canadian pork. However, there is also the danger that the disease could be brought to this country.

Egan Brockhoff, a veterinarian in Red Deer [Alberta, Canada], says producers and transporters of livestock have to be very careful. "The virus is spread through fecal oral transmission," he said. "So we want to make sure that trucks coming back to Canada that have been near American pigs are washed, disinfected and properly dried before returning to a Canadian hog farm."

Darcy Fitzgerald of the Alberta Pork Producers, says members are seeing higher prices for their product, but he cautions that preventing an outbreak of the virus in Canada is the priority. "Our bigger concern right now is making sure that the pigs we haul into the US don't allow us to see trucks come back up with the disease," he said. Fitzgerald said the economic effects will be felt mainly in the spring and summer.

Pork futures in the US have almost doubled in some cases and consumers can expect to pay more for pork as a result.

[The trucks, their disinfection, and the exceptional speed with which this virus seems to move, are concerns for Canada and its producers. Disinfection of the trucks is expensive, and may not be a perfect guarantee that the virus may not find a way to hitchhike to Canada. This virus seems to like cold weather, and temperatures in Canadian winters can be quite cold, thus allowing the virus to propagate extremely rapidly. It is a huge concern for Canadian and American producers. - Mod.TG]
