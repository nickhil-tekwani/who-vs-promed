KARNAL BUNT: RISK ASSESSMENT (02)
**********************************
[see: Karnal Bunt: risk assessment 970716173941]
Date: May-June 1997
From: California Agriculture

In April 1996, a quarantine was imposed on wheat grown in
Imperial County. The quarantine was supported by a USDA risk
assessment that showed an unacceptable threat of karnal bunt
outbreak from wehat shipped outside the area. Imperial County
Agricultural Commissioner Steve Birdsall called UC Riverside
Chancellor Raymond L. Orback to ask for assistance.
In response, Thomas M. Perring, Coordinator of UC's Institute for
Desert Agriculture (IDA), assembed a team of scientists
representing the County Coopertive Extension Offices in Imperial
and Riverside counties and the University's Berkely, Davis and
Riverside campuses. This team set out to conduct a site-specific
risk assessment that would take into account the unique
circumstances present in the Imperial and Palo Verde valleys.
Within 5 weeks, the researchers completed a report that included
an analysis of weather conditions in the two valleys vis-a-vis
conditions normally assocated with Karnal bunt; a risk assessment
based on site-specific data; a study of the economic impact on
growers in these areas; and recommendations for future research.
The risk assessment estimated the probability of spread of
karnal bunt from wheat harvested in the Imperial Valley to be 1
in 1.05 million if the millfeed was not treated, and 1 in 915,358
for the Palo Verde Vally.
Findings from the IDA's report had a major impact on public
policy. At Republican Duncan Hunter's request, Perring and Cindy
Giorgio, spcial assistant to the dean, went to Washington, D.C.
to meet with the USDA scientist who conducted the intial risk
assessment. They issued a joint statement comparing methods and
results and agreeing on a "near identical" level of risk.
Subsequently, Representative Sonny Bono introduced an amendment
to the 1997 agricultural appropriations bill, using the study to
request a compensation plan for wheat farmers and handlers and
asking USDA to review the study in establishing policy for the
1997 wheat crop. Hunter quoted the report in writing USDA
Secretary Dan Glickman to ask for a modification of the
quarantine. In California, the report was featured in a joint
hearing of the Senate Committe on Agriculture and Water Resources
and the Assembly Agriculture Committee. Discussions also took
place between the University and representatives from the
California Department of Food and Agriculture.
During a July 17 [1996] hearing before USDA, testimony by Hunger,
Califronia Farm Bureau Federation president Bob Vice, Imperial
County supervisor Brad Luckey and Birdsall drew heavily from the
report. The result was a proposal by USDA to remove unnecessary
restrictions by lifting the quarantine and establishing
"regulated areas." Each regulated field then would be classified
according to one of the five specific risk categories. In the
Imperial Valley, this means that all but 15 fields
effectively would be freed from restrictions other than continued
testing. On November 4, 1996, the concept of "surveillance areas"
was adopted by USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
(APHIS).
The IDA study served as an important catalyst for action.
Objective, scientific information was the tool decision-makers
needed to take the Karnal bunt issue out the political arena and
base their decision on sound science.
