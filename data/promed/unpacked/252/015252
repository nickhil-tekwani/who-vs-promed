Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in Austria
-------------------------------------------------
The last outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in Austria was
reported to the Office International des Epizooties in 2001. This
information was received on (and dated) 22 Jun 2005 from Prof Dr Ulrich
Herzog, chief veterinary officer, Federal Ministry for Health and Women,
Vienna.
A BSE case was laboratory diagnosed in a cow from a small farm with 8
cattle and 2 pigs located in Riezlern, Bregenz district, Vorarlberg federal
province, in the western part of the country.
The cow concerned was found dead on 26 May 2005. Before that date, it had
disorders in its movements, with no improvement after correction of
[attention to its? - Mod.SH] hooves. The owner attributed the movement
disorders to the cow's age (born in 1994) and did not consult a
veterinarian. The cow's head was drooping, and there were no disturbances
in excretion or behavior.
Diagnostic tests used: rapid test (15 Jun 2005) and immunohistochemistry
(21 Jun 2005). Both positive.
Source of outbreak or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.
Control measures
- after suspicion, the farm was banned immediately.
- culling and sampling of all cattle.

[Given the high risk for Austria from imported animals and meat and bone
meal over the last 2 decades (see Mod.AS's comments in BSE - Austria: 2nd
Case 20050621.1739), the 4 year gap between cases is encouraging. Of
course, traditionally, once a case of any disease is found, surveillance
increases either by design or by intensity of implementation, and sometimes
more cases are found. - Mod.PC]
