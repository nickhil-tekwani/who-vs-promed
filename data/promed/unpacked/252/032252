["Wild birds, particularly wild migratory water birds, are considered to be the main reservoir of avian influenza viruses. There is a constant risk of avian influenza being introduced into Ireland from wild birds particularly from November onwards each year as this is when migratory birds arrive and congregate on wetlands, mixing with resident species. Cold, short winter days also increase the risk of avian influenza due to increased virus survival times in the environment". Source: https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/50ce4-avian-influenza-bird-flu/
