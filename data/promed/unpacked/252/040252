A mysterious ailment that causes frogs to grow extra, deformed
legs and touched off environmental concerns may be the result of a
tiny worm parasite, not ozone depletion or pesticides, new studies
say.
Two studies to be published Friday in the journal Science conclude
defects found in frogs throughout the Western United States may
be caused by a trematode, a simple parasitic flatworm with a
complex life cycle that includes infecting the developing legs of
tadpoles.
Stanley K. Sessions of Hartwick College in Oneonta, New York,
says the worm infection causes the tadpoles to grow multiple hind
legs, a severe malformation that dooms the animal when it grows to
a mature frog. "Every single frog I have looked at with extra legs,
and I have looked at hundreds, all have these cysts around the
deformity," said Sessions, who co-authored one of the Science
studies.
Pieter T.J. Johnson, a recent graduate of Stanford University now
doing research at Claremont McKenna College in Southern
California, carried Sessions' early work one step further by
collecting trematodes from snails in 4 ponds where deformed frogs
were found. Laboratory tadpoles were then infected with the
worms.
Johnson found the more trematode infections the tadpoles
acquired, the more the legs of the adult frog were deformed,
multiplied or missing. He also showed that the deformities
developed in the laboratory experiments were the same as those
seen in the 4 ponds in Northern California.
Andrew Blaustein, an Oregon State University ecologist who
conducted experiments to determine if ultraviolet radiation was
causing the widespread problem, called Johnson's work "the best
experimental evidence showing a cause for the limb deformation in
amphibians."
Researchers worldwide have noted for years many species of
frogs are in decline, particularly in the Northern and Western
United States, Central America and Australia.

Scientists have suspected pesticides, chemical pollution --
particularly retinoic acid, and excess UV radiation caused by a
thinning of the atmosphere's ozone layer. A great deal of research
has been devoted to the issue because the sudden demise of
frogs were considered a possible warning about an unknown
environmental problem.
But the studies by Johnson and Sessions show at least some of
the frog problems are caused by Mother Nature herself.
Johnson said the increased deformities caused by the parasite
could be part of a natural biological cycle. However, he said it is too
early to hold humans blameless, saying fertilizer runoff may have
caused an increase in a water snail that is a key host of the
parasite.
The trematode has a life cycle that includes snails, tadpoles and
frogs, and birds. A just-hatched form of the parasite is consumed
or absorbed by a snail. The worm develops into a larvae that is
deposited in a pond. The worm swims until it hooks onto a tadpole
and then forms cysts in the leg buds of the developing amphibian.
When the frog matures, its hind legs are either missing, multiplied
or deformed. This makes the frog an easy prey for birds, which
become the next host of the parasite.
Digestive juices of the bird release the trematodes from their cysts
in the frog and the worms reproduce. Trematode eggs in the bird
feces are then deposited in a pond and the cycle starts anew.
Johnson said even though trematodes are found throughout North
America, the parasite probably is not the single cause for a
worldwide decline in frogs and other amphibians first noticed two
decades ago.
"It is far too early to say that this is the final answer for the
amphibian decline," he said. "Something different may also be
going on."
