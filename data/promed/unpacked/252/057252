Lone star ticks -- and thousands of their larvae -- have overrun the town of Aquinnah [on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts], biologist and tick expert Richard Johnson told Aquinnah selectmen at their meeting onWednesday [7 Oct 2020] following reports that showed a high incidence of tick-borne disease in the town this year [2020].

In a letter that went out last week, the town board of health reported 13 new cases of tickborne illnesses since April of this year [2020], including cases of Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, babesiosis, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. At the meeting, Mr Johnson said he was in Aquinnah on Tuesday [6 Oct 2020] surveying yards for ticks and found lone star larvae in every location he visited. "I was horrified," Mr Johnson said. "I've looked at a lot of ticks over the past 10 years, and the number of lone star larvae I found was just astonishing."

Mr Johnson is director of the Martha's Vineyard tickborne illness-reduction program. He said he receives at least one call or email a day alerting him to newly discovered clusters of lone star ticks on the Island. "They're everywhere," he said. "Every property that we have gone to in Aquinnah to do a survey, we've found lone star ticks. They're literally every place in the town except maybe the [Gay Head] Cliffs."

Lone star ticks are a relatively new species of tick to the Vineyard. Although they do not carry Lyme disease, they are known to carry other harmful pathogens that can cause diseases like ehrlichiosis and Rocky Mountain spotted fever, as well as a red meat and or dairy allergy in some individuals.

Mr. Johnson told the selectmen that he hopes this year [2020] is an anomaly, and the reason behind the explosion of lone star tick larvae is climatological and weather related. "I hope this isn't the new normal, but I fear that they're exploding in numbers," he said.

Mr Johnson said lone star ticks and larvae are normally found on the edge of the woods, sometimes in fields but also anywhere where the grass is at least 6 inches [15 cm] tall. The larvae are the size of a pepper flake, he said, and [noted that] lone star larvae, unlike deer ticks, stay balled up in groups of 2000-8000 ticks until they are nymphs. Brushing up against a cluster could mean hundreds or possibly thousands attaching themselves to skin or clothing. Currently, Mr Johnson said the best way to avoid contact with the clusters of larvae is to wear permethrin-treated clothing or spray clothing and shoes with 30% DEET spray.

Thinking of ways to combat the problem, selectman Juli Vanderhoop said she has previously suggested that the Aquinnah fire department conduct controlled burns along the edges of people's yards to eradicate the larvae. Mr Johnson said Ms. Vanderhoop's idea is an interesting one that he would like to see explored. He said he knows of a woman in Georgia who is studying the use of fire to eliminate ticks. "If they burn out underneath the woods enough, it takes away the undergrowth [and] changes the habitat, and lone star ticks disappear, which is totally consistent with what I know of pre-European and pre 20th-century management on the Island. You used to be able to see right underneath the woods; you could walk along and there was not all this undergrowth. If we can find a way to do that, that would be fabulous," Mr Johnson said.

Another suggestion mentioned at the meeting was introducing more bird species, like turkeys, towhees, and sparrows, to eat the ticks. The problem is that the birds carry them too. "It's a tradeoff," Mr. Johnson said. "My feeling is that more ticks are surviving by feeding on the turkeys and quail that people are releasing than are being eaten by the birds. I think we're shooting ourselves in the foot if we start releasing more birds. They definitely do eat them, and I wish we had more towhees, but we want to really be careful of unintended consequences."

He told selectmen that the number one thing the Island can do to reduce the threat of tickborne diseases is to reduce the deer population. Bow hunting season began this week [week of Mon 5 Oct 2020], which includes a USD 100 subsidy for each eligible tagged doe, funded by the tick-prevention program.

[It appears that lone star ticks (_Ambylomma americanum_) are well established on Martha's Vineyard Island in Massachusetts. This is not surprising since this tick has been moving northward and recently has been found in New York state (see Invasive tick - USA (NY) 20200517.7344992). They are already abundant on Long Island. Of the 84 ticks sent to Dr Saravanan Thangamani's New York laboratory from Suffolk County, more than half were lone star ticks. This tick has been found in Maine, to the north of Massachusetts (see CDC distribution map at https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/maps/lone_star_tick.pdf). This tick can feed on birds that, in turn, can move the ticks to new locations.

The occurrence of 13 new cases of tickborne illnesses, Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, babesiosis, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever is of concern. These cases may not all be due to lone star tick transmission, but some may be. Studies suggest that lone star ticks can transmit Heartland virus as well. Human Heartland virus cases have been identified in the Midwestern and southern United States. It is unknown whether the virus is present in other areas of the US. Bourbon virus was detected in collections of the lone star tick in Missouri. Human infections from Bourbon virus have now been recognized in the states of Kansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri, and there is serological evidence of infection of white-tailed deer in North Carolina, all geographically far away from Massachusetts. - Mod.TY
