Kunjin virus - Australia (NT): alert 20010206.0238

Geographical Range of Kunjin virus
----------------------------------
Kunjin virus is not restricted to Australia, as stated in the moderator's
comments on the post entitled 'Kunjin virus - Australia (NT): Alert'. In
all, 3 isolates of Kunjin virus were obtained from Sarawak, Borneo in 1966,
by Bowen and colleagues (Bowen, et al. Ann Trop Med Parasitol 1970; 64: 263-8).
In addition, Hawkes, Marshall, and our laboratory have found serological
evidence of Kunjin virus in Papua New Guinea, and Olson [and colleagues
and Kanamitsu [and colleagues have found serological evidence of Kunjin
virus in parts of the eastern Indonesian archipelago. We have also recently
isolated Kunjin virus from mosquitoes trapped on Saibai Island in the
Torres Strait, about 4 km from the coast of Western Province of Papua New
Guinea. Taken one step further, Kunjin virus has recently been
re-classified by the International Committee for the Taxonomy of Viruses
(ICTV) as a subtype of West Nile virus. The definition of where Kunjin
extends to is not then quite so simple!

[Similar information was forwarded by Dr Carl J Mitchell, CDC Fort Collins,
and former moderator Dr CH Calisher. Dr Calisher has further pointed out
that the viruses grouped with Japanese encephalitis virus should be
described more accurately as the Japanese encephalitis virus complex
(rather than serogroup). The incorrect information that I used to compile
my comment to the preceding posting was abstracted from a 1998 article by 2
distinguished arbovirologists. It is clear that knowledge of the biology of
flaviviruses is expanding rapidly. The close taxonomic relationship of
Kunjin virus to the more widely distributed West Nile virus, pointed out by
Professor Mackenzie, is intriguing. - Mod.CP
