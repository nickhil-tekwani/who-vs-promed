Gracie was a happy and healthy 4-year-old dog who enjoyed walks and
tearing around her yard. Then Gracie changed. "She could hardly get up
from her bed. She could hardly stand," [a woman] of Janesville said of
her golden and Labrador retriever mix. Gracie continued favoring
different legs and plopping onto the floor, causing [her owner] to
take her to a veterinarian. The diagnosis: Lyme disease.

Lyme disease is on the increase among people in Rock County, and it's
a common diagnosis in their pets, too. Veterinarian Terence McSweeny
of All Creatures Small Animal Hospital in Janesville said about 5
percent of the new patients he tests for Lyme disease have positive
results.

Debbie Erickson of the Rock County Health Department said Lyme cases
in the county have increased in people, with 48 cases reported in
2010, compared to 28 in 2009. Statewide, Lyme disease cases totaled
3495 in 2010, compared to 2587 in 2009, a 35 percent increase, the
state Department of Health Services reported.

Lyme disease impacts the skin, nervous system, heart, and joints. [It
is caused by bacteria that] spread through bites from infected deer
ticks. More than 20 000 cases of the disease have been reported in
Wisconsin residents since 1980, according to the health services
department. Symptoms of Lyme disease include fever, aches, arthritic
pain, and neurological problems, Erickson said. Antibiotics are used
to treat the disease.

Most Rock County residents contract Lyme locally, even though the
disease is more common in northern Wisconsin, she said. "We definitely
have deer ticks with Lyme in Rock County," Erickson said. "We have had
clients that have had pretty severe side effects from the disease."

McSweeny said he screens pets he sees in his office. He said many
dogs with positive tests don't show symptoms [clinical signs]. He said
the disease leads to kidney failure. "I think it's a problem,
particularly in this area," McSweeny said. "I think it's very
important from March through November to have your dog on a flea or
tick preventative." People and pet owners are becoming more aware of
the disease, Erickson and McSweeny said.

Gracie was taken to a veterinarian the same day she showed symptoms
[clinical signs] and was put on antibiotics, Hanson said. "It was like
a miracle," [her owner] said. "The next day, she showed no signs of
lameness." She doesn't like to walk Gracie in the woods behind her
house anymore and said that area is where she likely attracted Lyme.
Since Gracie's treatment, she has had as much energy as ever, the
woman said. "It is a happy ending," she said.

Lyme disease occurs 3 to 30 days after the bite of an infected tick.
Symptoms in people include rash, fever, chills, fatigue, headache,
joint pain, and swollen lymph nodes, according to the state Department
of Health Services. The disease is treated with antibiotics.

To reduce the chance of getting Lyme disease:
- Avoid wooded and bushy areas with high grass and leaf litter.
- Use tick repellants applied according to the label's instructions.
- Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants to help shield you from
ticks.
- Landscape homes and recreational areas to reduce the number of
ticks. Create tick-safe zones using woodchips or gravel along the
border between lawn and wooded areas.
- Check for ticks frequently.
- Remove ticks slowly and gently, using a pair of thin-bladed
tweezers.
- Check pets before allowing them inside.
- Speak to a veterinarian about tick repellant for pets.

[Lyme disease, due to the spirochete _Borrelia burgdorferi_, is
distributed focally within the United States: it is considered endemic
in 8 northeastern states (Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland,
Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island)
and 2 upper Midwestern (Wisconsin and Minnesota); 93 percent of the
total cases reported to the US CDC during 2003-2005 were reported from
these 10 states
(http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5623a1.htm).

Since Lyme disease became nationally notifiable in 1991, the annual
number of reported cases has more than doubled. This increase is
likely the result of several factors that include: enhanced case
detection, as well as a true increase in disease incidence due to more
people (accompanied by their pet dogs) living in suburban
neighborhoods near wooded areas that place them in proximity to
enlarging populations of deer, which, although not susceptible to Lyme
disease, supply the adult tick with a required blood meal, and
enlarging populations of the white-footed mouse and other small
rodents (the primary reservoirs for Lyme disease) and _Ixodes
scapularis_, the primary vector for Lyme disease in the northeastern
and upper Midwestern US.

ticks can carry _Borrelia burgdorferi_, the spirochete responsible for
lyme disease. - Mod.TG]]
