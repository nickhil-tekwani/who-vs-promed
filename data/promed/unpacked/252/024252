First Report on the Occurrence of Bacterial Stripe Organism _Acidovorax
avenae_ subsp. _avenae_ in Rice Seeds from Burkina Faso.
--------------------------------------------
I. Somda, M. S. Veena and C. N. Mortensen. Danish Government Institute of
Seed Pathology (DGISP) for Developing Countries, Thorvaldsensvej 57,
DK-1871 Frederiksberg C, Copenhagen, Denmark. Plant Dis. 85:804, 2001;
published on-line as D-2001-0516-02N, 2001. Accepted for publication 19 Apr
2001.
Breeder rice seeds from Burkina Faso harvested in 1999 were tested
for _Acidovorax avenae_ subsp. _avenae_. This pathogen affects rice, maize,
sorghum, and other Gramineae. Ten samples of 200 seeds [per] sample
were tested by the cassette holder method for detection of this bacterium
(1). Seedlings were evaluated for symptom development after 14 days at
27 to 30 C and 100 percent relative humidity under fluorescent light (12 h
photoperiod).
Bacterial stripe symptoms were observed in seedlings raised from 9 of 10
seed samples tested, and incidence ranged from 5 to 20 [percent]. Diseased
seedlings showed water-soaked areas on coleoptiles and brown stripes on leaf
sheaths and mid-ribs. [26] strains obtained from diseased seedlings were
characterized using several criteria.
Colonies were small, whitish-grey, raised, entire and translucent on
nutrient agar and cream-tan, raised, entire, and did not produce
fluorescent pigment on King's medium B. They were Gram negative,
oxidase positive and nitrate positive. Variable reactions were recorded for
starch hydrolysis; 22 strains reacted positively and 4 negatively. All 26
strains reacted positively in ELISA [using] antiserum against _A.
avenae_ subsp. _avenae_. Results using Biolog GN MicroPlates (Biolog
Inc., Hayward, CA computer identification system, Release 4.0) showed
all strains to be _A. avenae_ subsp. _avenae_ (sim. 0.709 to 0.802).
Hypersensitive reactions on leaves of 2-month-old tobacco plants
infiltrated with bacterial suspensions were recorded within 24 h. Strains
were tested for pathogenicity by injecting stems of 21-day-old rice plants
with bacterial suspensions (approximately 10 E8 CFU/ml). Inoculated
seedlings were incubated for 4 to 7 days under humid conditions at 28 C.
Inoculated rice plants showed brown stripes and non-inoculated control
seedlings remained symptomless. Based on biochemical, serological, and
biological characteristics, strains were identified as _A. avenae_ subsp.
_avenae_.
This is the first report of _A. avenae_ subsp. _avenae_, causal agent
of bacterial stripe of rice, in Burkina Faso. The common presence of _A.
avenae_ subsp. _avenae_ in breeder rice seeds emphasizes the need for
control measures to limit further spread to unaffected rice-growing areas
and other cereal crops.

[_A. avenae_ subsp. _avenae_ was formerly classified as _Pseudomonas avenae_
subsp. _avenae_. According to Norman Schaad, Leader of the USDA/ARS Exotic
Plant Pathogenic Bacteria research program. The group has developed PCR
primers and probes for real-time PCR for identification of _A. avenae_
subsp. _avenae_ which infects cereals including rice, and _citrullus_ which
infects watermelon and cantaloupe. Schaad points out that proper
identification and nomenclature are critical problems in phytobacteriology.
The pathogen occurs widely on rice in Asia and Africa.
