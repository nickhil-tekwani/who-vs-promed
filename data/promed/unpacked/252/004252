The drinking water supply continues to be interrupted 14 days after the
catastrophic spill (29 Mar 2003) of more than 1.2 billion liters of toxic
waste composed of caustic soda and chlorine emptied into the Pomba River
and spread into the Paraiba do Sul (Rio de Janeiro's main river) from one
of the 2 industrial reservoirs belonging to a wood-pulping factory near
Cataguazes in Minas Gerais state, and that is affecting at least 8
municipalities in 3 states (Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, and Espirito
Santo) [1,2].
The Rio de Janeiro State Health Secretary announced today that, even after
treatment, the water captured from the Paraiba do Sul River is not adequate
for human consumption. Thus, Cia. Aguas do Paraiba, the private service
provider for the city of Campos dos Goytacazes (the second largest city --
population circa 406 000 -- of the State of Rio de Janeiro after the city
of Rio de Janeiro) continues to be forbidden, until further notice, from
providing fresh drinking water.
The prolonged shortage of drinking water has forced the population at
large, in at least 8 municipalities, to seek water under ground, with the
opening of wells and self-provision of untreated water of undetermined
biological and chemical qualities. Health providers are alerting the
population that drinking groundwater from wells is also a hazardous
practice due to presence of metal (Hg, Pb, Al) ions and microbial pollution.
Because nearly 70 percent of the urban community in this area does not
[have access to] sewage treatment, domiciliary groundwater wells are very
likely to be highly contaminated with fecal coliforms and viruses drained
from septic tank effluents. This situation presents an imminent threat of
hepatitis A and enteropathogenic/enterotoxigenic _Escherichia coli_
infections. Local pediatric infectious disease specialists are reported to
have witnessed an alarming increase in the number of acute watery and
bloody diarrhea cases.
Luis Jos de Souza, the regional president of the Brazilian Society for
Clinical Medicine, alerted [the public] yesterday to these risks, and
suggested mass vaccination against hepatitis A in the city of Campos dos
Goytacazes as a suitable countermeasure.
The widespread indiscriminate use of groundwater is likely to result in
greater morbidity and mortality from waterborne pathogens. A previous study
on the epidemiology of _Toxoplasmosis_ spp. carried out in this city
demonstrated that drinking water from wells is one of the major sources of
contamination for humans and livestock in Campos [3].
The Rio de Janeiro State Health Secretary is advising the public to treat
groundwater with sodium hypochloride (100 ml of a 2.5 percent solution for
every 1000 liters), a measure that may be effective against a wide spectrum
of microbes, but not for killing of _T. gondii_ oocysts, for which
extensive boiling or filtration (3 mm pore) is required.

[The disease toxoplasmosis can be transmitted by ingestion of either
oocysts (in the feces of cats) or bradyzoites (in raw or undercooked meat,
of just about any animal). Although infections can occur through water,
this is not considered a common method of infection. However, infections in
people can be treated with the combination of pyrimethamine and
sulfonamides. - Mod.TG]
