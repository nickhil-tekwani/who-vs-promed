On 2 Dec 2014, the [Hong Kong] Centre for Health Protection (CHP) received report of a cluster of _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ infections. So far, 5 students of a primary school were affected; they were 3 boys and 2 girls aged between 6 and 9 [years]. 3 of them studied in the same class of primary 2; the other 2 are siblings, 1 in primary 1 and the other in primary 4, [neither of whom recalled having] contact with the other primary 2 cases.

They presented with symptoms of respiratory tract infection, including fever, runny nose, cough and shortness of breath from 21 Nov to 7 Dec [2014]. All of them required hospitalization. The clinical diagnosis of 3 students [was] pneumonia, while the other 2 were upper respiratory tract infection. They have been in stable condition all along. Their nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested positive for _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ by PCR.

There had been no recent abnormal increase in respiratory tract infections among other students in the primary school. CHP has conducted field investigation and has provided health advice to the school, which was placed under medical surveillance. Investigations are ongoing.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ (_M. pneumoniae_) is an "atypical" bacterium that causes lung infection. It is a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia (lung infections developed outside of a hospital). _M. pneumoniae_ infections are sometimes referred to as "walking pneumonia." Some experts estimate that between 1 and 10 out of every 50 cases of community-acquired pneumonia in the United States is caused by _M. pneumoniae_. However, not everyone who is exposed to _M. pneumoniae_ develops pneumonia.

In general, _M. pneumoniae_ infection is a mild illness that is most common in young adults and school-aged children. The most common type of illness caused by these bacteria, especially in children, is tracheobronchitis, commonly called a chest cold. This illness is often seen with other upper respiratory tract symptoms, like a sore throat. Sometimes _M. pneumoniae_ infection can cause pneumonia, a more serious infection of the lungs, which may require treatment or care in a hospital.

Outbreaks of _M. pneumoniae_ [infection] occur mostly in crowded environments, like schools, college dormitories, military barracks, and nursing homes, where transmission is possible through airborne droplets from close person-to-person contact. _M. pneumoniae_ infections also frequently spread within households.

[_M. pneumoniae_ is a common cause of respiratory tract infection among children and young adults, causing up to 40 percent of all cases of community-acquired pneumonia.

Prior ProMED-mail posts have reported on recent outbreaks of _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ infection in Europe and Israel (Mycoplasma pneumoniae - USA: (GA) college students, 2012 20130905.1925311 and Mycoplasma infection - France, Israel: increasing incidence 20120226.1053193).

_Mycoplasma_ are bacteria that lack a cell wall and are bounded only by the cytoplasmic membrane. _Mycoplasma_, too small (about 0.1 micron in diameter) to be detected by conventional microscopy, can be detected by DNA probe, enzyme immunoassay, real-time PCR assay (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=19403761&dopt=Abstract), and growth in vitro. However, isolation of these organisms in vitro can be difficult and may require up to 6 weeks. In vitro media must supply long-chain fatty acids and cholesterol that are required for cytoplasmic membrane synthesis. Without a cell wall, they are unaffected by many common antibiotics such as penicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics that target cell wall synthesis. Several species are pathogenic in humans, including _M. pneumoniae_.

_M. pneumoniae_ commonly cause a mild acute upper respiratory infection with fever, nonproductive cough, pharyngitis, malaise, muscle pains, earache, and headache in children and young adults (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/mycoplasmapneum_t.htm). Radiologically confirmed pneumonia develops in 5-10 percent of cases. _M. pneumoniae_ accounts for 15-20 percent of community-acquired lower respiratory infection in adults that require hospitalization and probably an even greater proportion of those that do not require hospitalization. Approximately 20 percent of infections are asymptomatic. Extrapulmonary syndromes, including cardiologic (e.g., pericarditis, myocarditis, arrhythmias), neurologic (e.g., encephalitis), hematologic (hemolysis), and dermatologic findings (erythema multiforme) may occur rarely. Cold agglutinins may be present in the acute serum of 30-60 percent of patients.

Transmission of _M. pneumoniae_ infections probably occurs through close contact with contaminated respiratory droplets. Infections with _M. pneumoniae_ occur sporadically throughout the year, and outbreaks are most common during the late summer and early fall, typically in 4-7-year cycles (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00022322.htm). Spread of infection is common in households, schools, college dormitories and military bases where people are living together in close proximity. The prolonged incubation period for this pathogen of 2-4 weeks may contribute to protracted duration of outbreaks. Because _M. pneumoniae_ infection most commonly causes upper respiratory illness (only an estimated 3-10 percent of persons with infection experience pneumonia), infected persons often go about their normal activities and infect others.

Macrolides, tetracyclines (doxycycline), fluoroquinolones are the antimicrobials of choice for _M. pneumoniae_ infections. However, macrolide resistance has been reported and appears be increasing (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2223908/ and http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/17/6/10-1558_article.htm). A real-time PCR assay has been developed to detect in clinical specimens the mutations that confer macrolide resistance in _M. pneumoniae_ (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2565909/). - Mod.ML
