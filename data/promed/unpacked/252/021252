[The previous ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20120724.1213759) stated,

"A visit by The Nation to the Port Health Services at MMIA ascertained the persistence of the fake cards. The Chief Nursing Officer, who did not acquiesce to the publication of her name in print, said, "The fake yellow fever cards, which had been seized by the port authority from passengers, still bear 1969 as the year of inception of issuance. Whereas it has been reviewed; now the new original ones bear 2005."]

Tayo Babalobi responded with the following information:

Classifying Yellow Fever Cards bearing 1969 (as the year of inception of issuance) as 'fake yellow fever cards' is misinformation.

I had my 1st yellow fever vaccination (Stamaril Pasteur Lot 1565) on 16 Jan 2002 on an INTERNATIONAL HEALTH REGULATIONS (1969) Yellow (Fever) Card stamped at the Immunization Centre, Jaja clinic, University of Ibadan, Ibadan Nigeria; and re-vaccinated (with STAMARIL PASTEUR LOT G5188) on the same INTERNATIONAL HEALTH REGULATIONS (1969) Yellow (Fever) card at the same Immunization Centre on 16 Jun 2011.

Between 2002 and now, I have been to South Africa in 2005, twice in 2009 and in 2010; to Ghana in 2011 (and other African countries up till 2011, Europe (2011) and USA (2012); and neither at any of the visa issuing embassies nor at the port of departure or entry to these countries and the Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport Lagos, has my 1969 Yellow (Fever) Card ever been refused or classified as fake.

[The previous ProMED-mail report clearly indicated that fake yellow fever immunization cards were being sold in Nigeria. It is unfortunate, that a Nigerian health official's blanket statement about the legitimacy of all immunization cards dated 1969 inaccurately casts suspicion on legitimate cards bearing that date such as the one possessed by Tayo Babalobi. ProMED thanks Tayo for clarifying the situation. - Mod. TY]
