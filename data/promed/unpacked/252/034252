Killer virus hits CSIRO research
The CSIRO [Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial
Research Organisation, a non-governmental entity] will destroy all
cereal plants at 23 of its research centres in Canberra today in an
effort to eradicate a killer wheat virus discovered on site. In a
devastating blow to the research body's AUD 15 million [USD 9 198
600] cereal program, about 7000 plants will be destroyed, including
barley, oats, and corn plants.
Cases of wheat streak mosaic tritimovirus infection were confirmed at
the CSIRO's Black Mountain and Ginnindeera centres earlier [in April
2003], and wheat plants have since been destroyed.
A consultative committee on plant diseases met yesterday to decide
whether other cereal crops at the CSIRO should also be destroyed.
CSIRO volunteered to destroy all the plants, representing 20 percent
of its research effort. The chief of CSIRO Plant Industry, Jim
Peacock, said it was the responsible thing to do.
It is believed to be the first confirmed case in Australia of the
virus, which is prevalent in North America, Russia, and Eastern
Europe.

[Wheat streak can cause complete crop failure following heavy
infection. The virus is transmitted by the wheat curl mite
(_Eriophyes tulipae_). Mite larvae acquire the virus by feeding on
infected plants and retain the ability to transmit virus for about a
week after acquisition. Windborne viruliferous mites spread the virus
to neighboring plants. A key management strategy is to prevent
volunteer wheat from growing in the interval between harvested spring
wheat crops and fall-sown winter wheat. A key question is how the
virus reached Australia. To my knowledge, WSMV is not
seed-transmitted in wheat but is seed-transmitted in some maize
cultivars at low levels (0.1 to 0.2 percent). Do any of our readers
have information on this point?
