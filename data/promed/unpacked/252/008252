A virus [probably not a virus. - Mod.TY] is spreading through small cattle to people in Rajasthan and other parts of the country that looks like bed bug [?] but is more dangerous than dengue. The disease, called scrub typhus, with DAH (diffuse alveolar hemorrhage) is spreading among people through cattle in which platelets in blood declines rapidly and later blood starts oozing out from body parts and the victim dies. A person of Jaislamer district, suffering from scrub typhus and undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Jodhpur, died on Tuesday evening [1 Sep 2015]. The body was brought to Jaisalmer on Wednesday [2 Sep 2015].

Informing about this case, CMHO Dr NR Naik said that the man, a resident of Jhabra village of Jaisalmer district, who was staying at Mohangarh, consulted a private doctor. But with fever not subsiding, the family members brought him to Jaisalmer and during the investigation at a private hospital, the doctors suspected dengue and referred him to Jodhpur, where he was admitted at a private hospital. The platelet counts kept falling and he died on Tuesday. Dr Naik said, the dengue report for the patient came out negative but was suffering from scrub typhus, which is spread through mites in small cattle.

The patient was administered many units of blood, but there was no improvement in his health and later blood started flowing out in lungs and he died.

Naik said that last year [2014] too, many dengue patients were found in Jaisalmer and the health dept as preventive measure has started putting tamiflos [sic. temephos] in water ponds and tanks and started spraying parathrium [sic. permethrin]. Wherever rainwater is accumulated in pits, burnt oil has been put and the health department is totally active in preventing dengue. On the other hand, an expert said that scrub typhus is a serious fever which is spread by mites. This is spreading in Jaipur and nearby areas. This is probably the 1st case in Jodhpur division in which the victim died. [During 2014] 200 cases of scrub typhus came to light in Rajasthan; generally it spreads among people working in fields.

[This sounds like hemorrhagic fever, although scrub typhus can cause disseminated intravascular coagulation and bleeding. They likely used the Weil-Felix test, which was probably positive for them to make the diagnosis of scrub typhus. The sensitivity of the Weil-Felix for scrub typhus is poor, but the specificity has been reported as good by some investigators (see http://www.ncdc.gov.in/writereaddata/linkimages/May%20June-20098604739980.pdf, and http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/9/1395.full.pdf) although false positive results do occur. - Mod.ML

No mention is made of whether tests were done to rule out Crimean Congo henorrhagic fever virus infection in this case. Although the illness described in the news report above is compatible with a diagnosis of scrub typhus, the news report above fails to mention in the description of the clinical picture the presence of an eschar, a black lesion at the site of the chigger bite, that is often a useful diagnostic clue.

There was a significant outbreak of scrub typhus in Rajasthan in 2014. Mod.ML commented in ProMED post archive no. 20150821.3582448, "Outbreaks of scrub typhus have previously been reported from South India (http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12098-012-0721-0). Because scrub typhus can present in a non-specific manner, its diagnosis can be difficult and sensitive, and specific diagnostic tests may not be widely available.

"Scrub typhus is caused by the rickettsia-like bacterium _Orientia tsutsugamushi_ that is transmitted by the bite of a chigger mite present in shrubberies. Symptoms develop 6 to 21 days after the chigger bite. Fever, headache, lymphadenopathy, and myalgias are common. A characteristic black eschar that is useful for making the diagnosis may be seen at the site of a chigger bite and a maculopapular rash may also be present. A picture of the eschar can be found at http://medind.nic.in/icb/t10/i8/icbt10i8p918.pdf.

"Pneumonitis, meningoencephalitis, jaundice, renal failure, and myocarditis can develop if treatment is delayed. Because death rates for untreated scrub typhus patients are 1-30 per cent, treatment with doxycycline should begin immediately upon suspicion of scrub typhus without awaiting laboratory confirmation (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/content/12/2/pdfs/v12-n2.pdf). Treatment with azithromycin has been found to be equally effective (http://aac.asm.org/content/51/9/3259.full, http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/9/1329.full, and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3957884/)."
