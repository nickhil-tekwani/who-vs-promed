Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks (1)
Outbreak location 1: Klisiai, Jurbarko, Taurages [Taurage]
Started: 28 May 2021
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Birds / 1238 / 1238 / 79 / 1159 / - / -

Affected population: In the trader premises with 1238 poultry kept (ducks and geese (1-2 weeks of age)- 150, turkey (2-3 weeks old) - 200, broilers (2-3 weeks old) - 695, chickens (1 week old) - 100 unit, laying hens - 70 units, adult ducks - 23 unit) the samples were taken performing the epidemiological investigation.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with wild species.

Epidemiological comments: The samples were taken performing the epidemiological investigation. Two hobby holdings indicated that birds were purchased from the trader premises and the purchased birds died a few days later. A total of 9 samples from dead turkeys, geese, broilers and one-day chickens were collected and tested for HPAI and H5N8 strain was confirmed. The epidemiological investigation has started to find out the possible source of the virus introduction. The restricted zone around the affected establishment has been established and all the measures are implemented. No other commercial holdings are located inside the zones established.

Control measures at the event level
Domestic control measures applied: disinfection, zoning, stamping out, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste

Wild control measures applied: Control of wildlife resrevoirs.

[The following abstract comes from a scientific report on Avian influenza overview in EU/EEA and the UK -- published on 31 May 2021, which is available in ref 1:

Abstract:

"The 2020-2021 epidemic with a total of 3555 reported HPAI detections and around 22 400 000 affected poultry birds in 28 European countries appears to be one of the largest and most devastating HPAI epidemics ever occurred in Europe. Between (24 Feb and 14 May 2021), 1672 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus detections were reported in 24 EU/EEA countries and the UK in poultry (n=580), and in wild (n=1051) and captive birds (n=41). The majority of the detections in poultry were reported by Poland that accounted for 297 outbreaks occurring in a densely populated poultry area over a short period of time, followed by Germany with 168 outbreaks. Germany accounted for 603 detections in wild birds, followed by Denmark and Poland with 167 and 56 detections, respectively. A second peak of HPAI-associated wild bird mortality was observed from February to April 2021 in north west Europe. The observed longer persistence of HPAI in wild birds compared to previous years may result in a continuation of the risk for juveniles of wild birds and mammals, as well as for virus entry into poultry farms. Therefore, enhanced awareness among farmers to continue applying stringent biosecurity measures and to monitor and report increases in daily mortality and drops in production parameters, are recommended. As many as 16 different genotypes were identified to date in Europe and Russia, suggesting a high propensity of these viruses to reassort. The viruses characterized to date retain a preference for avian-type receptors; however, transmission events to mammals and the identification of sporadic mutations of mammal adaptation, indicate ongoing evolution processes and possible increased ability of viruses within this clade to further adapt and transmit to mammals including humans. Since the last report, 2 human infections due to A(H5N6) HPAI were reported from China and Laos and 10 human cases due to A(H9N2) low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) virus identified in China and Cambodia. The risk of infection for the general population in the EU/EEA is assessed as very low and for occupationally exposed people low. People exposed during avian influenza outbreaks should adhere to protection measures, strictly wear personal protective equipment and get tested immediately when developing respiratory symptoms or conjunctivitis within 10 days after exposure."
