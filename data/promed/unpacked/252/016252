Undiagnosed bovine illness in Germany and the Netherlands
---------------------------------------------------------
In August 2011, the Animal Health Service in Deventer recorded a
significant number of cases of severe diarrhoea, fever and milk drop
in cattle farms in the Eastern part of the Netherlands. Laboratory
diagnostic testing performed by the Animal Health Service and the
Central Veterinary Institute of the Wageningen University and Research
Centre (in Lelystad), was focused on faecal samples from diarrheic
cattle. Despite extensive diagnostic testing, including (RT)PCR,
culturing techniques, electron microscopy and microarray screening
with the EPIZONE-Biochip 5.1 (containing molecular probes covering
about 2000 virus species), an agent which could clearly be associated
with the observed clinical signs, was not identified.

In all of the affected cattle farms, severe diarrhoea, accompanied by
milk drop and fever, was the most prominent clinical sign. In none of
the farms were the clinical signs associated with a Bluetongue-like
illness. Since October, the number of cases has dropped to normal
levels.

The clinical cases as described recently in North Rhine-Westphalia
might represent a different phenomenon. In the Netherlands, similar
cases have not been identified yet. However, in cooperation with the
Friederich Loeffler Institute (FLI), attempts will be made to
[incorporate Dutch cattle] in the search for the presence of viruses
from the genus Orthobunyavirus, which were detected in North
Rhine-Westphalia.

[We are grateful for the above update from Deventer, east Netherlands
(map at http://healthmap.org/r/1teW).

We are looking forward to the results of tests in samples from cattle
in east Netherlands for the presence -- or otherwise -- of the
Orthobunyavirus, recently identified by FLI in dairy cattle in
north-east Germany (archived post 20111119.3404). For the location of
Schmallenberg, see map at http://healthmap.org/r/1teV). The genomic
sequences of the said novel Orthobunyavirus, provisionally titled
"Schmallenberg-virus," were demonstrated by a newly developed
real-time RT-PCR in positive samples from 4 different farms (about 100
samples were tested). No causal relationship between the virus and the
clinical disease (as seen in Germany) have been established yet.

The main clinical signs described in Germany were "fever and a
significant drop of milk yield for several days, in some cases also
diarrhea and abortions." The main clinical signs recorded in the
Netherlands, as described above, were "severe diarrhoea, fever and
milk drop." Have abortions not been seen?

We are looking forwarded to the results of the tests for the virus in
the Dutch samples, as well as to information from Germany on the
investigations into the pathogenicity of the Schmallenberg virus. -
