Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s), modified stamping out, no vaccination, no treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: no other measures

[In 2006 Burkina Faso reported 4 outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtype H5N1. The event summary and map are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=4590

In the article by Ducatez MF, Tarnagda Z, Tahita MC, et al: Genetic Characterization of HPAI (H5N1) Viruses from Poultry and Wild Vultures, Burkina Faso (Emerg Infect Dis. 2007; 13(4): 611-3.
doi: 10.3201/eid1304.061356; http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/13/4/pdfs/06-1356.pdf), there is a statement indicating that "Genetic analysis of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) viruses from poultry and hooded vultures in Burkina Faso shows that these viruses belong to 1 of 3 sublineages initially found in Nigeria and later in other African countries. Hooded vultures (_Necrosyrtes monachus_) could potentially be vectors or sentinels of influenza subtype H5N1, as are cats and swans elsewhere."

Although the source of infection has not been determined, given the current HPAI events in Nigeria and the role of wild birds in the epidemiology of the disease, the recent outbreaks in Burkina Faso could be related to the events in Nigeria.

During 2015 Nigeria has reported 55 outbreaks of HPAI H5N1; this includes those reported in northern Nigeria (41 outbreaks, see event summary and updated map at: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=16926) and those reported in southern Nigeria (14 outbreaks, see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=16977. - Mod.CRD]
