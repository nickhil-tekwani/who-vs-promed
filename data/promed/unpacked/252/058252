I think people need to know that the classical postmortem signs of anthrax
in livestock [are not always present. Many cases that are diagnosed as
anthrax usually come in as something else, and it is picked up by the
diagnostic laboratory. The signs of hemorrhage from various orifices is
nice, but many times it is not seen with the dead animal. The presentation
of rapid bloating and lack of rigor are often seen in many non-anthrax
cases particularly in hot weather (when most cases of anthrax in cattle
occur). All dead animals, particularly if dead for any length of time, tend
to be this way. Splenomegaly, another sign of classical anthrax septicemia,
is nice to have, but in peracute cases of anthrax this is often not present.
Many a veterinarian has posted and sent an anthrax animal to the laboratory
not knowing what they have or instead suspecting a toxic event. Culturing
the organism in animals that have been dead for some time can also be
difficult. Liver and spleen samples may only have very few organisms
present, while a culture of the lung may be more rewarding. This is
particularly true for animals that have been dead for a long time (i.e.,
over 24 hours). Histological evaluation of formalin-fixed tissues are also
not spectacular. The only lesion that you probably will see is numerous
rod-shaped bacilli in vessels and sinusoids of the liver and spleen.
Pulmonary tissue will have large numbers of bacteria in vessels and alveoli
with no inflammatory response. Occasionally some edema may be present in
the lungs.

[Which brings me back to my earlier statement that, in the absence of a
microscope and stain in one's pickup, we are dependent on a
yet-to-be-readily-available cowside test for anthrax when we need a rapid
test. Otherwise there are inherent and unavoidable delays in waiting for a
laboratory result, however keen, enthusiastic, and competent they may be.
This delay puts the herd at risk besides increasing the probability of
environmental contamination. - Mod.MHJ
