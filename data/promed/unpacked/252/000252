Six cases of hepatitis A virus (HAV) amongst members of a religious
community were confirmed between August and September. Epidemiological
evidence suggests that 5 of the patients became infected from a common
source, while the sixth became infected via person-to-person transmission.
Some concern has been expressed about the possibility of secondary
transmission of HAV in this community, and also about an outbreak of
shigellosis. There has been considerable mixing between members of this
community and others, but particularly with a community in the United
States, where an increased incidence of shigellosis was noted in recent weeks.
