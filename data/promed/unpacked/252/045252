Two more monkeys test positive for bacterium from Tulane lab; local officials cite lack of information
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Two more monkeys have tested positive for exposure to a dangerous bacterium at the Tulane National Primate Research Center near Covington [Louisiana], officials said on Friday [6 Mar 2015], even as state and local authorities complained about Tulane withholding information about 177 potentially exposed monkeys.

The 2 new monkeys showed an immune response to the bacterium but had no symptoms of infection by _Burkholderia pseudomallei_, which is native to South East Asia and Australia and can cause melioidosis, a potentially fatal disease in humans and animals.

Scientists at the primate center have been researching potential vaccines to protect against the bacterium, but that research was being conducted on rodents in a highly secured lab. In November [2014], however, 2 monkeys showed signs of the disease and eventually had to be euthanized, leading to an investigation into how the bacterium escaped from the lab. During that investigation, 2 more monkeys tested positive for exposure, and another one became ill and had to be euthanized.

Friday's announcement that 2 more monkeys showed antibodies consistent with exposure to the bacterium brings the total of confirmed exposures to 7. [Six monkeys, one human. - Mod.MHJ] The 2 latest monkeys will be retested to confirm their positive tests, officials said. How the bacterium escaped the lab remains unknown, but the investigation has focused on the center's veterinary clinic. All of the monkeys that have showed signs of exposure were treated in one room of the clinic, Tulane University spokesman Michael Strecker said.

The most recent pair of monkeys to test positive were in the clinic during October and November[2014], the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

The latest news followed a Thursday [5 Mar 2015] story in USA Today that said 177 monkeys that were treated in the clinic during the period when the bacterium is thought to have been at loose there were returned to their cages in the center's 5000-strong monkey breeding colony, greatly expanding the number of potential exposures. Tulane officials have said they have tested nearly 400 monkeys, but the latest revelation means the testing will have to be expanded, Strecker said.

Strecker and primate center Director Andrew Lackner have insisted throughout that there is no threat to public health.

The bacterium can be spread only through direct contact and isn't an airborne pathogen. A raft of tests on air, soil and water near the center, as well as blood tests on monkeys and high-risk employees at the center, have come back negative for the bacterium. Another report in USA Today, however, questioned whether those tests -- especially those on the soil -- were adequate.

All of the center's research into "select agents," a group of pathogens considered to pose a potentially severe threat to human, animal or plant health, has been suspended at the direction of CDC. The center sits on a 500-acre campus just south of the Abita River. Colonies of the bacterium can develop in soil after being introduced there through animal or human waste, officials have said. Once there, it can be spread by water runoff after a rain.

After a human is exposed to _Burkholderia pseudomallei_, it can take years before symptoms appear. Once diagnosed, however, it is treatable with antibiotics.

[It is logical that a retrospective seroprevalence search would have been initiated, 1st with monkeys that had been through the hospital, and then wider up to the total given of 400. I edited out the paragraphs on bureaucratic bent noses as this contributed little. So far there is no new insight on how this infection spread. - Mod.MHJ
