If the diagnosis of canine leishmaniasis (CanL) in US foxhounds is based
only on serology and/or clinical signs, steps should at once be taken to
see _Leishmania_ amastigotes in stained smears of bone marrow and/or lymph
node aspirates. Parasites should be isolated in culture and be typed by
isoenzymes at an international center stocking the WHO reference strains.
Were the dogs that died autopsied? If so, what was found? The fact only one
breed at apparent risk seems to have the disease is difficult to explain. I
wonder if their behaviour is different from the others? Or is the housing
different?
Transmission to so many dogs must be by sand flies. Congenital transmission
in dogs has been reported, but it is rare and does not explain the
presumptive US cases. Cases of CanL are recorded every year in northern
European countries where there are no sand flies but, almost without
exception, these are dogs imported from, or who have visited, endemic
places around the Mediterranean or on the Iberian peninsula.
The exceptions are very rare cases in dogs having never been in endemic
areas but have co-habited with an infected dog. (Refs in 'Canine
leishmaniasis: an update' - see below). But these cases are very, very rare
indeed and, again, seem to be an unlikely explanation of so many US cases.
Expertise in leishmaniasis in the US has declined to the point only a
handful of American workers now know anything about the natural history of
the leishmaniases. Two who do have correctly pointed out that there are
sand flies in the US (they even reach Canada!). Regular collections of sand
flies around the affected kennels should be started now and be continued
until the end of the summer. The sand fly season may be very short indeed.
There are still a few US workers who can identify them. If there are any
laboratory colonies of indigenous sand flies, attempts should be made to
infect them with an isolate from one of the dogs to see which species are
able to support the growth of the parasite. When the sand fly fauna is
known and the probable vector(s) are identified, large samples of
wild-caught sand flies should be examined for parasites which must be
isolated and properly identified. Then a study of the behaviour of the
vector(s) may suggest ways of control. Attached to this email is a copy of
the Proceedings of the Canine Leishmaniasis Forum held in Spain last year
entitled 'Canine leishmaniasis: an update'. This has papers on the
epizootiology, clinical diagnosis and treatment of CanL, a review of CanL
presenting in areas outside, means of control, biology of sand flies
etc.etc. Printed copies are available gratis by e-mailing Ms. Nicole Kluess
