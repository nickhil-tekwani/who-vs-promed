Trichinellosis outbreak in Latvia linked to bacon bought at a market,
Jan-Mar 2005
-------------------------------------------------
Between January and March 2005, 45 trichinellosis cases were notified to
the Public Health Agency (PHA) of Latvia. This represents a 246 per cent
increase compared with the same period in 2004 [moderator's interpretation.
- Mod.SH], and involved 42 patients in 3 outbreaks and 3 sporadic cases.
The largest of these outbreaks affected 27 patients and occurred between 28
Feb and 14 Mar 2005. Cases occurred in 3 administrative areas (Riga, the
capital of Latvia, the district around Riga, and the Madona district).
Epidemiological analysis linked the infection to eating salted streaky
bacon bought at Riga central market. Of the 27 patients, 18 were female and
9 were male (average age 41; range: 13-60). The main symptoms were
weakness, nausea, facial edema (in more than half of the cases), and fever.
In more than in half of the cases, the body temperature exceeded 38 C. All
of the patients were admitted to hospital. The incubation period ranged
between 2 and 4 weeks. [For a table of patients in the 2005 Riga outbreak
of trichinellosis, see the URL above].
The Latvian Food and Veterinary Service (FVS) collected 37 meat samples
from retail outlets identified in the investigation, and all tested
negative for trichinella larvae. One retail outlet was found to be selling
pork of unknown origin which came with falsified delivery notes, so the
pork had not been tested for _Trichinella spiralis_ in
government-supervised inspections. The descriptive epidemiology of those
who were ill strongly implicated this streaky bacon as the vehicle for
infection. A case control study was not carried out. It was not possible to
confirm that the trichinellosis outbreak was caused by the bacon, as none
was available for testing.
Trichinellosis situation in humans:
Trichinellosis in both humans and animals is a mandatory notifiable disease
in Latvia, and sporadic cases must be registered and reported. All
outbreaks are required to be reported. Since 2002, there has been a
European case definition for reporting trichinellosis [1]. The laboratory
diagnosis is by testing blood serum for antibodies to _Trichinella
spiralis_. Epidemiologists from the Public Health Agency investigate each
case notified by a physician. The PHA, in collaboration with the Food and
Veterinary Service (FVS), check the producers of implicated foods if there
is reasonable suspicion that a business may be connected with the case. In
cases of human trichinellosis due to consumption of animal products, or
when the _T. spiralis_ parasite is found in animal products and there is a
potential risk of human infection, the PHA and FVS cooperate in exchanging
information. In the past 7 years (1998-2004), 247 cases have been reported
in Latvia. Annual case numbers peaked in 2000 with 91 cases, which included
4 outbreaks involving a total of 77 cases.
In the period 2001-2004, the number of cases reported annually has remained
steady (range: 20-24), with an incidence of between 0.7 and one case per
100 000 inhabitants. In the last 5 years, cases of trichinellosis have been
identified in all the age groups above one year old. [figure 2, Human
trichinellosis cases in Latvia, 1998-2004 in URL above].
[figure 3. Incidence of trichinellosis per 100 000 population, by age
group, 2000-2004, see URL above]: In the past 4 years (2001-2004), between
one and 3 outbreaks have been identified each year involving between 2 and
20 people. In each outbreak, the epidemiological investigation has shown
that the infections were due to eating infected pork.

2004 / 24 / 3 / 13
Trichinellosis situation in animals:
The FVS is responsible for surveillance, reporting, and control of zoonoses
in the animal population and the food chain. It has produced guidelines for
slaughter houses for the veterinary examination of cows, sheep, goats and
horses. Diagnosis in the FVS slaughter house laboratory is by trichinoscopy
and compression or recovery of larvae after mechanical digestion of a
sample. All pig and horse carcasses are tested for trichinella larvae. If
there are any positive results, the affected slaughterhouse is investigated
and placed under restrictions while legally prescribed remedial measures
are instituted. When animals are slaughtered at home, or hunted for
personal consumption, the owner or hunter is responsible for ensuring the
carcass is tested before it is consumed.

In the period 1999-2004, trichinellosis was identified in 3 pigs on one
farm in 2000 and in 2 pigs on one farm in 2001. In each case, the pigs were
slaughtered at home without veterinary supervision. Every year,
trichinellosis is found in large numbers of wild pigs. To control
trichinellosis outbreaks, the FVS organizes unannounced checks on food
producers that have been associated with trichinellosis outbreaks. In the
1st quarter of 2005, the FVS tested 58 samples from various retail grocery
products (fresh pork, 17 samples; smoked pork and bacon, 33 samples; salted
bacon, 8 samples) for trichinella larvae. Trichinella larvae were not found
in any of these samples.

[ProMED-mail compliments the Latvian authorities for a thorough
investigation, which provides as much evidence as possible for the source
of the outbreak. The phrase "selling pork of unknown origin which came with
falsified delivery notes" emphasizes that, though the surveillance of
trichinella in Latvia is probably appropriate when manufacturers --
including small farms slaughtering animals for their own consumption --
follow the rules of meat inspection, in the case of intentional fraud,
surveillance obviously fails. It is possible that the meat sold as pork
meat was instead wild boar, which has a high prevalence of trichinella in
Latvia. - Mod.EP]
