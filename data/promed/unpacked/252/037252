Over 78 000 cases of chikungunya have been reported in the state
[Karnataka, Bangalore]. The disease is said to be widespread in
Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra. The disease was prevalent in North
Karnataka. It has now spread to Bangalore, Tumkur and Kolar districts.
Chikungunya, a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes, is widely
prevalent in the state, and over 78 000 people in 61 taluks have been infected.
The disease, which was so far concentrated in the districts of North
Karnataka, has now spread to Bangalore Rural, Bangalore Urban, Tumkur
and Kolar districts. As many as 78 175 people had been infected with
the disease in 101 taluks of 15 districts as of Wednesday [19 Apr
2006]. Symptoms include high fever and pain in the limbs. The disease
is widespread in neighboring Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.
The highest number of people infected is in Gulbarga district (31
304), followed by Raichur (14 614), Tumkur (10 818), Bidar (9784),
Chitradurga (3867), Bellary (3358), Bangalore Rural (476), Kolar
(206) and Bangalore Urban (87). Over 600 villages in Gulbarga
district and 360 villages in Bidar district have been affected,
Basavaraju, the Commissioner of Health and Family Welfare Services,
told The Hindu on Thursday [20 Apr 2006].
Senior scientists from the National Institute of Virology, Pune,
visited some of the affected areas. They collected blood samples from
1437 people, of which 63 tested positive: 43 in Bidar, 4 in Bagalkot,
9 in Raichur and 7 in Gulbarga. However, no one has died of the
disease so far. The Department of Health and Family Welfare has taken
steps to control the disease. Officials have undertaken both indoor
and outdoor fogging in the affected villages as part of the
preventive measures. But there is a shortage of fogging and spraying
equipment. The government has decided to buy equipment from Andhra
Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.
Doctors have been sent to Gulbarga, Bellary, Bidar, Raichur, Bijapur
and Tumkur, where a large number of people have been infected. There
is no vaccine or treatment for the viral infection, which is
self-limiting, so prevention is the best measure, he said.
Pots, containers and drums used for storing water should be covered
properly and overhead tanks cleaned regularly to prevent the breeding
of mosquitoes, he added.
