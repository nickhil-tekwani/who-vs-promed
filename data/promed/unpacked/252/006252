Patients die of rabies in Flores
--------------------------------
Of the 40 people infected with rabies over the last 2 weeks in West
Manggarai regency, East Nusa Tenggara, 2 have died, an official said
Tuesday [2 Feb 2008]. All of the infections resulted from the victims
being bitten by dogs.

IG Ngurah Harijaya, head of the West Manggarai Health Office, said in
a report to East Nusa Tenggara Governor Piet A Tallo the regency's
death toll from rabies was now 4 this year [2008]. Ngurah said the 40
rabies cases were recorded in 5 districts: Komodo with 15 cases,
Sanonggoang (2), Lembor (15), Kuwus (5) and Macang (2) [Total 39 -
Mod.JW]. "There was an increase in the number of infections in nearly
every district," he said.

According to data from the East Nusa Tenggara administration, of about
200 000 dogs in Fores and Lembata, 50 000 have not been vaccinated.
The data also show 134 out of 647 people infected with rabies over the
past 10 years have died [impossible -- see below - Mod.JW].

[The following comment has been received from Henry Wilde, MD, FACP,
Professor of Medicine Division of Research Affairs, Faculty of
Medicine, Chulalongkorn University Rama IV Road, Bangkok, Thailand
10330 <wildehenry@yahoo.com>.

The report concerning rabies on Flores Island is not surprising. This
previously rabies-free island experienced an epidemic in 1998 that
was never controlled. Two WHO experts failed to convince the local
authorities to start mass vaccination of dogs; instead they decided
to kill as many as possible, which failed to stop rabies on this small
isolated island next to Timor [Windiyaninsih C, Wilde H, et al J
Thai Med Assoc 2004;87:1389-93]. The quote from the Jakarta Post must
have contained something "lost in translation." I must assume that
the 2 rabies deaths occurred from among the 40 people exposed (not
those "infected"). Rabies is a virtually 100 percent fatal disease in
an infected person. The remaining confusing statements in the Jakarta
Post, however, suggest that there are continuing cases of
canine-origin rabies on this island and that efforts to eradicate it
are failing or not being implemented. Flores is a predominantly
Christian province where dogs are largely kept as pets and for
ceremonial dinners (Yes, they eat dogs).
