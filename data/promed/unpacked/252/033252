Note that Tunica Cutoff is a lake only part of the year. In the spring,
when the Mississippi River rises, the cutoff becomes contiguous
with the river. This is same for all the dredging cutoffs, such as Old
River and DeSoto Lake (immediately South of Tunica), Miller's
Fish Camp (immediately North of Tunica), etc.
Any disease in one of these lakes has access to the entire
Mississippi River drainage.

[This would indicate there is a larger fish population at risk than was
originally believed. Alternatively, perhaps the virus can be
eliminated, or a treatment found before the lake becomes
contiguous with the river? - Mod.TG
