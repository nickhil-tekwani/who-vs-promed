Plantain farmers hit by infestation
-----------------------------------
Plantain farmers in Rosenanti Tuschen Backlands, East Bank, Essequibo
[Essequibo Islands-West Demerara region] are being severely affected by
sigatoka disease, which has taken over their farms.

The farmers have raised this issue with minister of agriculture, Robert
Persaud. Persaud said that the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation [FAO]
is currently conducting some studies into the disease and that a consultant
was in the country for 2 weeks to analyze the situation. The Ministry is
trying to get more resources to better understand the disease. "I suggest
that very soon we will get on top of it. The technical staff will be doing
a workshop with all the plantain farmers in the area and looking at
preventative steps they can take, but really there is only one way you can
deal with this problem and that is to destroy [the plants]."

Officers from the Agriculture Ministry are presently working on a programme
to keep the infestation in one area rather than having it moved to other
critical areas. "We will first diagnose the problem and try to get some
suckers and other support for the farmers." Minister Persaud said that this
situation only exists in the Tuschen area, and he urged farmers not to move
any suckers out of the area.

[It is not specified in the report above whether the disease is yellow
sigatoka (YS; sigatoka leaf spot) caused by the fungus _Mycosphaerella
musicola_, or black sigatoka (BS, black leaf streak) caused by _M.
fijiensis_. Both pathogens affect species and hybrids of _Musa_, which
include cultivated bananas and plantains. When both are known to be present
in an area, it is often difficult to distinguish between them under field
conditions, and laboratory analysis may be needed for a clear diagnosis.
Both YS and BS have been reported to cause serious problems in the region.

Symptoms and epidemiology are similar for YS and BS. BS is one of the most
devastating leaf diseases of bananas, while YS is considered somewhat less
serious because symptoms appear mainly on older leaves and, therefore, less
damage is caused to photosynthetic tissue. Also, there are more cultivars
of banana and plantain with degrees of resistance to YS than to BS. YS has
been replaced by BS in many areas, but YS is more adapted to cooler
temperatures and is often dominant at higher altitudes.

The pathogens are spread by water, wind, and with plant material, including
suckers, and can cause yield losses of up to 50 per cent. Fruit produced on
diseased plants can ripen prematurely during commercial shipment causing
further losses. Disease management includes frequent applications of
fungicides, phytosanitary measures to reduce inoculum, and cultural practices.

An undiagnosed disease of bananas was reported earlier from Guyana, which
led to quarantine restrictions being imposed by the eastern neighbour
Suriname (ProMED-mail post 20090824.2984). It is not clear whether this
disease is now suspected to be one of the sigatoka pathogens, or whether
the report above refers to a different problem.
