The press service of the Ministry of Emergency Situations has
reported that 2 more people have been hospitalized with Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in the Kyzyl-Orda region in the south of
Kazakhstan, and that one of them has died. In total, 8 people have
contracted CCHF in the Kyzyl-Orda region since the beginning of 2007
and there have been 3 fatalities.

[The high death rate (37.5 percent) in Kyzyl-Orda region this year
(2007) is a matter for concern. By comparison, over a period of 8
years the death rate in the SFD (Southern Federal District) of Russia
averaged 5.9 percent. These data suggest a failure to diagnose milder
non-hemorrhagic cases of CCHF. - Mod.NP]

CCHF is a tick-borne viral disease reported from more than 30
countries in Africa, Asia, South-East Europe, and the Middle East.
Its distribution is roughly coincident with that of its _Hyalomma_
spp. tick vector. The virus is transmitted by contact with domestic
animal products (such as, blood of slaughtered animals and
occasionally milk), by contact (and nosocomial) transmission, but
mainly by tick-bite. The frequency of diagnosis of CCHF in southern
Russia and central Asia, where the population is aware of the hazard
of tick-transmitted disease, suggests that elsewhere there may be
failure to diagnose mild non-hemorrhagic cases of CCHF. - Mod.CP]

Healthcare authorities in the [Republic of] Kalmykia have reported a
decline in the number of people seeking medical treatment for tick
bites. As of 6 Jul 2007, a total of 6892 tick bites have been
recorded in the Republic, including 131 involving children. This
represents an increase of 60 cases in comparison with the same period
last year [2006].
A total of 87 persons have been admitted to hospital on suspicion of
having contracted Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), and a
diagnosis of CCHF was confirmed in 57 cases, which included one fatality.
The senior health officer of Russia, Gennady Onishchenko, has
acknowledged the seriousness of the CCHF situation in the Southern
Federal District (SFD) of Russia this year [2007]. During the period
1999-2006, CCHF was recorded in 7 of the 13 administrative regions of
the SFD -- the Rostov, Volgograd, Astrakhan, Stavropol regions, and
the Republics of Dagestan, Kalmykia, and Ingushetia.
Over a period of 8 years, a total of 766 persons contracted CCHF. Of
these 45 persons (5.9 percent) died. Data for 2006 reveal that 58
percent of patients contracted CCHF either as a result of tick bites
or by careless removal of ticks without protection of the hands.
Another 7 percent of cases was contracted during agricultural work
and 14 percent during recreation in the countryside. In 20.5 percent
of cases the source of infection was not determined. Cases of CCHF
are recorded predominantly among those living in rural environments.
Herding of livestock and inadequate stock-rearing practices
facilitate the spread of foci of CCHF.

[Last year (2006), the incidence of CCHF in the Southern Federal
District of Russia was highest in the Republic of Kalmykia, where 69
persons contracted the disease. Current data for 2007 suggest that a
similar situation is developing. The situation has been exacerbated
by unusually warm winter weather and delays in tick control measures. - Mod.NP]

CCHF has been diagnosed in 45 patients in the Stavropol region.
According to the [regional] branch of Rospotrebnadzor [Territorial
Directorate of the Federal Services for Consumer Protection and Human
Welfare], cases of CCHF have been reported from 18 districts in the
region. Most of the cases have been reported from 3 districts: 7
cases in the Apanasenskovy district, 6 in the Neftekumsky district,
and 5 in the Ipatovsky district. Blagodarnensky, Krasnogvardeysky,
Sovetsky, and Turkmensky districts have reported 3 cases each;
Arzgirsky, Budenovsky, Kursky, and Levokumsky districts 2 cases each;
and Andropovsky, Aleksandrovsky, Grachevsky, Izobilnensky,
Hovoselinsky, Petrovsky, and Trunovsky districts one case each. The
epidemiological situation regarding CCHF in the region remains
extremely serious.
While 40 persons have recovered from the infection and have been
discharged from hospital, 5 are still receiving treatment in
hospital. The majority of patients contracted CCHF by tick bite
through their work with agricultural livestock; 26 percent of
patients received tick-bites during recreational activities.
More than 6000 persons, including 2380 children, have sought
treatment for tick bites. Last week alone [25 Jun-1 Jul 2007], 550
persons, including 280 children, received treatment for tick-bites,

[The epidemiological situation in the Stavropol region remains grave.
Over a 3-week period the number of patients has increased from 23 to
45 and has exceeded the corresponding figures for last year (2006). - Mod.NP]
