I am an editor at Shoreland, and I posted this outbreak of anthrax a couple
weeks ago on our web site, Travel Health Online:

Here is the source article:

04/25 1240 BRF--Ghana-Anthrax
ACCRA, GHANA: At least 15 people have died in a suspected outbreak of
anthrax in northeastern Ghana, health officials said Friday. Dr. Kingsley
Aryee, a veterinary officer of the Bolgatanga district, said villagers in
Nyongbare, 480 miles north of the seaside capital Accra, died after eating
the meat of cows they found dead. Aryee said 500 cattle have been vaccinated.
The same region was hit earlier this year with a meningitis outbreak that
killed more than 85 people.
