In response to an alert raised due to epidemic exanthematous rashes in
children in a kindergarten, an outbreak investigation was carried out
in a municipality in the north of Portugal in late spring 2008. The
warden at the kindergarten was interviewed, and a self-administered
questionnaire was given to parents and staff. Blood samples from 7
children with facial erythema were collected for serological
investigation. 17 cases of erythema infectiosum, due to infection with
parvovirus B19, were identified and classified as confirmed. No cases
occurred among the 8 adult staff members. An overall attack rate of 38
percent was observed among the 45 children (born in 2002 and 2003).
All cases were mild and without fever.

This parvovirus B19 outbreak made it possible to estimate the basic
reproduction number (R0) at between 6 and 8 (or above). Staff members,
parents and local clinicians were informed that the infection could
pose a risk when caught by people with special clinical conditions.
All children had received one dose of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine
and 60 percent had received 2 doses. The 7 children with serologically
confirmed parvovirus B19 infection were immune to measles and rubella.
All 7 were negative for measles- or rubella-specific IgM.

Alert
----
In the morning of 16 Apr 2008, the local health authority (LHA) was
contacted by telephone by a nurse working in the school health
programme team. She reported that several children in a kindergarten
presented spots on the face. The kindergarten warden suspected that
the nearby plane trees were causing an allergic reaction to several
young children.

Preliminary assessment
----------------------
In the afternoon of 16 Apr 2008, 2 members of the LHA visited the
kindergarten premises and spoke with the warden. The team examined 6
children with the spots. The appearance was strikingly similar to
pictures published in the literature describing cases of erythema
infectiosum, with the typical "slapped face appearance." All children
were in a good physical condition; none had fever or other symptoms,
and only one presented a rash in the abdominal region.

Methods
-------
A case was defined as probable if erythema on face, extremities or
trunk was observed in members of the kindergarten community between 5
Apr and 19 Jun 2008.

A case was classified as confirmed if, in addition to the probable
case definition, it was laboratory-confirmed or had an epidemiological
link with a confirmed case.

Written vaccination data from all children and adults were checked by a nurse.

A nurse visited the kindergarten on 9 May 2008 to collect blood
samples from 7 of the children who had presented facial erythema and
whose disease onset had been 11 to 34 days before. Enzyme immunoassays
(EIA) for specific IgG and IgM antibodies levels against measles,
parvovirus B19 and rubella were done by 2 local general practitioners
(GPs) who had been treating the children and previously [obtained]
informed consent from the parents.

Results
-------
Kindergarten community: The 45 children attending the kindergarten
(29 boys and 16 girls) were born between January 2002 and December
2003. There were 2 groups of children, 20 in class room 1 (13 boys
and 7 girls) and 25 in class room 2 (16 boys and 9 girls).

The 8 adult staff members were all women, born between September 1954
and August 1972. None of the staff members had ever been vaccinated
against measles but, following the Portuguese guidelines for their age
group, only one was young enough (born in 1972) to have received one
dose of that vaccine.

All children had received one dose of MMR vaccine at between 15 and 20
complete months of age (mean age at vaccination = 15.9 months). 27
children (60 percent) had received a 2nd dose between 60 and 73
complete months of age (mean age at vaccination = 63.9 months). Among
the children that had received only one dose, 9 had not yet completed
6 years of age, and the remaining 9 had not yet completed the age of 7
years.

Epidemiology
------------
In total, 17 cases were observed among the 45 children and none among
the 8 staff members. The date of onset of the 1st known case was on 5
Apr 2008 and the date of onset of the last case on 19 Jun 2008. The
peak of the outbreak was in the 3rd week, when 5 cases occurred
[illustrated by a figure -- see Source URL]. The attack rate (AR)
among the children was 38 percent (17/45). The AR was higher among
females (41.7 percent) than among males (24.1 percent), but the
difference was not statistically significant (p=0.29). 5 additional
cases were reported among the household contacts of the 17
kindergarten cases: 4 siblings and one parent. None of the staff
members became ill.

The days of onset of the 10 cases from class room 2 are graphically
represented in a 2nd figure in the original text. If the case-to-case
interval is 6 to 11 days [7], then it is very likely that the 1st case
on 5 Apr 2008 was the primary case, infected outside the kindergarten,
while the following 6 cases were secondary cases, probably infected by
the 1st case. Cases 8 to 10 were a 3rd generation, infected by one or
more of the secondary cases.

Thus, provided that all children were susceptible before this outbreak
and taking into account the definition of the basic reproduction
number (R0) [8], the estimated value of R0 in this outbreak was 6.
However, if 25 percent or more of infections were asymptomatic [9],
the R0 for this outbreak is likely to have had a value of up to 8 or
more.

Laboratory study
----------------
Blood samples had been collected from 7 of the 17 cases that had
occurred before the nurse visited the kindergarten on 9 May 2008. The
specific IgM antibody tests for measles and rubella were negative for
all 7 children tested. Measles IgG concentrations varied from 538 to
6361 mIU/ml, and all children were classified as immune. Rubella IgG
concentrations varied from 42 to 340 IU/ml, and all children were
classified as immune. Regarding parvovirus B19-specific antibodies,
all 7 children were reactive for IgG, but only 4 were also reactive
for IgM.

Clinical manifestations
-----------------------
The 17 erythema episodes were classified as confirmed cases of
erythema infectiosum. All other members of the kindergarten were
classified as "non-cases," whereas there were no situations compatible
with the definition of "probable case." The 17 cases presented facial
erythema, lasting between 2 and 5 days (in 16 children) and 10 days in
one child. 8 patients had only facial erythema, while the remaining 9
also had the rash on the trunk and/or extremities. Itching was
reported by 2 children, and none of the cases were febrile. All cases
were very mild, and no clinical complications were observed.

Control and prevention measures
-------------------------------
The premises were inspected, and they complied with the Portuguese
legal requirements. The kindergarten staff was informed about the
benign nature of erythema infectiosum and the possible risk for
pregnant women and those with anaemia and immuno-deficiencies. It was
recommended to exclude children from the kindergarten if they
developed fever [none had fever]. Strict hand washing procedures after
contact with patients were recommended. The same information was
issued by letter to all parents. An email explaining the situation and
the clinical conditions under which parvovirus B19 infection poses a
particular risk was sent to all GPs working at the local NHS unit.

Discussion and conclusion
-------------------------
It was confirmed that the outbreak was due to infection by parvovirus
B19. All 17 cases unequivocally met the case definition. The 3 cases
that were not reactive for parvovirus-specific IgM had very typical
clinical symptoms, and the blood samples had been collected 15, 25 and
26 days, respectively, after the onset of symptoms.

We are not sure about the reasons for these negative laboratory
results, but we think that [it may have been due to] low sensitivity
of the laboratory method, because the levels of parvovirus
B19-specific IgM were generally very low, even in the reactive
samples. Although it is arguable whether effective preventive measures
can be taken [4,8], the usual recommendations were issued.

Several parvovirus outbreaks had been detected and studied in a
neighbouring municipality in 2004 [4]. Should there be a connection
between these outbreaks and the one described in this paper, it would
be consistent with the reported periodicity of between 3 and 7 years
for parvovirus B19 epidemics in a given community [9]. In 2004, the
children described here had not been exposed to the infection because
they were [not?] attending any kindergarten and didn't have much
contact with other children. Moreover, seroprevalence data in 2001-02
showed that the infection was rare in young age groups [10]. We,
therefore, believe that our estimated range for R0 is likely to be
valid. Should there be immune children, then the reported R0 values
would be an underestimate.

No cases were observed among staff members, probably because they
were all immune. Recent Portuguese seroprevalence data [10] have
shown a high proportion of immune individuals in the age groups of
the staff members of the described kindergarten. Furthermore, we
believe that their professional activity is associated with increased
exposure to parvovirus, compared with the general population.

We did not recommend vaccination against measles for adult staff
members because previous studies have shown that Portuguese women in
those age groups are not only immune to measles but have
measles-specific IgG levels well above protective levels [11].

We were able to prove that the outbreak was not measles or rubella.
Furthermore, all children had received one dose of MMR vaccine, and
the levels of measles- and rubella-specific IgG among the 7 studied
children were well above the protection thresholds. Those children
who had not received the 2nd MMR dose were still within the age range
recommended for that vaccination. Such high coverage values are
consistent with what has been observed in the north of Portugal [2]
and in the annual internal evaluations in our municipality
(unpublished data).

[Human parvovirus B19 infection (sometimes called 'Fifth disease') is
a mild rash illness that occurs most commonly in children. The ill
child typically has a "slapped-cheek" rash on the face and a lacy red
rash on the trunk and limbs. Human parvovirus B19 infects only
humans. Domestic dogs or cats may be immunized against "parvovirus,"
but these are animal parvoviruses that do not infect humans. An adult
who is not immune can be infected with human parvovirus B19 and
either have no symptoms or develop the typical rash of fifth disease,
joint pain or swelling, or both. Usually, joints on both sides of the
body are affected. However, human parvovirus B19 infection may cause
a serious illness in persons with sickle-cell disease or similar
types of chronic anemia, and in those who have innate or acquired
immune deficiencies. In particular, serious complications may develop
from human parvovirus B19 infection during pregnancy, which is
perhaps the most significant feature of human parvovirus 19 infection.

However, perhaps the most important outcome of the Portuguese
investigation is that the epidemiologists have been able to exclude
involvement of measles or rubella viruses in the outbreak in the
kindergarten as part of the effort which has contributed to
maintaining Portugal's almost unique in Europe measles-free status. -
