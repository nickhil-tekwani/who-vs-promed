The number of patients infected by leishmaniasis has increased rapidly in Khyber Agency, with nearly 1300 cases reported in 2 months. Authorities fear the number of leishmaniasis cases may increase further if proper steps to control the infection are not taken.

Khyber Agency surgeon Dr Samin Shinwari told The Express Tribune: "We have registered 1085 cases in Landi Kotal, 60 in Jamrud, and 155 in Bara. There might be some cases in Tirah valley as well, but we cannot report them because vaccination teams cannot visit the area."

He added that around 700 patients had been treated so far, while over 100 injections were administered to patients whose condition was not severe. Patients having tumours on any part of the body from the disease were treated with thermotherapy. Treatment can take up to one month depending on the severity of the case.

"The increase in the number of patients has compelled us to start a special programme for treatment. We have trained doctors and paramedics for this purpose and brought more medicines and equipment to cope with the situation," Shinwari said.

Replying to a question about the patients stranded in Tirah, he said they have received information about infected children there, but the exact number cannot be confirmed.

Vaccination teams cannot be sent there due to deteriorating law and order, but residents have been instructed to go to nearby hospitals of any subdivision if they contract the disease.

Fata Health Services Director Dr Fawad Khan said Khyber, Orakzai, Bajaur, and South Waziristan have been affected by leishmaniasis for the past 10 years.

"I am not aware of the recent increase in the number of cases in Khyber Agency, but we have provided all facilities to the agency surgeon, and he has the authority to take any initiatives he considers necessary," Khan said.

The disease is caused by the bite of sand flies that breed in forest areas, caves, or the burrows of small rodents. Wild and domesticated animals and humans themselves can act as a reservoir of infection.

Symptoms of leishmaniasis include fever, malaise, weight loss, anaemia, and swelling of the spleen, liver, and lymph nodes. Infection can be prevented by avoidance of sand fly bites through the use of repellents or insecticides.

Leishmaniasis is endemic in 88 countries. There are 1-1.5 million cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis reported yearly worldwide, according to the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy.

[Leishmaniasis is highly endemic in Afghanistan and the tribal areas of Pakistan. See the recent review by Alvat et al. (Alvar J et al. and the WHO Leishmaniasis Control Team. Leishmaniasis worldwide and global estimates of its incidence. PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e35671). Available at:
http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0035671

In 2010, an incidence of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) of 155/100 000 population was reported from Kabul, Afghanistan. Visceral leishmaniasis appears to be rare, but is probably underreported. CL is a major and rapidly increasing public health problem, both among the local Pakistani population and the Afghan refugees in camps. Current (2009-2010) high case loads in hospitals suggest another outbreak in Federal Administered Tribal Areas, Khyber Agency, and Torkhum (bordering Afghanistan). CL is estimated to affect 15 000-20 000 people in Pakistan yearly (Alval et al. 2012). - Mod.EP
