The Viet Nam Ministry of Health reported today [3 Oct 2022] the 1st monkeypox case in the country in Ho Chi Minh City.

According to state media, the patient is a 35-year-old woman who began showing symptoms on [18 Sep 2022] while traveling in Dubai (from July 2022 to 22 Sep 2022, to Viet Nam) -- fever and fatigue, chills, muscle aches, headache and cough, red, itchy spots on the arms, trunk, and face.

Immediately after returning to Viet Nam, on 23 Sep 2022, the patient visited Tu Du Hospital and suspected of having an infectious disease, was transferred to Ho Chi Minh City Dermatology Hospital. Here, the doctor examined and suspected monkeypox; the patient was isolated, and samples for diagnostic testing were taken (real-time PCR test at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases and the Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City).

On 25 Sep 2022, the patient had an initial positive result for monkeypox and was transferred to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City for further isolation, treatment, and genetic sequencing at the Hospital. Clinical research by Oxford University in cooperation with the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City.

Immediately after receiving information that the patient was suspected of having monkeypox, the Ministry of Health asked the People's Committee of Ho Chi Minh City to direct specialized agencies to continue promoting the implementation of disease prevention and control measures, urgently doing genetic sequencing tests and continue the epidemiological investigation, outbreak handling, isolation, and treatment of patients according to professional guidance of the Ministry of Health. At the same time, the Ministry of Health has asked the People's Committees of provinces and cities to be on duty and strengthen the implementation of measures to prevent and control the monkeypox epidemic.

Currently, the patient is in stable health with no fever and is being continued to be isolated and treated at the Ho Chi Minh City Hospital for Tropical Diseases under the guidance of the Ministry of Health.

With the information extracted through epidemiological investigation, together with the results of real-time PCR test and gene sequencing, the Ministry of Health determined that this was a case of monkeypox, which was transmitted from abroad. All cases of close contact with patients in Viet Nam (since returning home) are monitored and monitored according to regulations and no suspected cases have been detected.
