Ramularia leaf spot has been making its presence felt in both winter and spring barley crops across the UK, with yield losses as high as 0.5 t/ha. When symptoms finally show late in the season, they are often mistaken for less-damaging diseases. Ramularia is hard to predict, tricky to identify and difficult to control. The cost of the disease to the barley industry has been estimated at GBP 10 m/year [about USD 13 m/year].

Neil Havis, Scotland's Rural College (SRUC), explains [that] ramularia has the ability to go undetected for much of the growing season. Since 2017 the pathogen has been resistant to SDHIs [succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors] and triazoles, as well as strobilurins, so is untroubled by much of the chemical armoury available. "That latest resistance developed quickly, which suggests that it's a very diverse population. In the UK, we now see no activity from these fungicides. But in other countries some of these still work or give partial control."

SRUC has shown that the pathogen has a genetic make-up that disguises it. "That allows it to remain benign in the plant until there's a change in the host, perhaps as a result of environmental stress factors, which triggers the production of toxins," says Dr Havis. "These cause the brown spots on leaves." This unusual characteristic makes it difficult to forecast. Attempts to identify the environmental variables that influence disease epidemics are ongoing.

The fungus grows from infected seed, most seed stocks now carry [it] under the seed coat. Seed surface dressings don't get to the pathogen. SDHIs, which used to have an effect, have now been lost to resistance. On crop debris and late in the season, airborne spores [are produced] that can infect volunteer plants and potentially early autumn-sown crops. New varietal resistance is needed. The fungus is causing problems across Europe, as well as in other parts of the world.

[Ramularia leaf spot (RLS) of barley is caused by the fungus _Ramularia collo-cygni_ (Rcc). It is considered an emerging pathogen of increasing importance on barley crops, especially in Northern Europe. Symptoms include small brown rectangular lesions with yellow margins within leaf veins, premature leaf senescence and loss of plant vigour. RLS can cause extensive damage to the upper leaves in spring and winter barley once crops have finished flowering, which can lead to extensive losses in yield and quality. RLS is often found in association with other leaf spots such as sun burn, agrochemical scorch or nutritional stress.

The fungus is spread with infected plant material and wind. It can also affect some other graminaceous hosts, which may serve as pathogen reservoirs. It can be detected on seeds and in symptomless leaves and may spread in crops sometimes without causing severe epidemics. The fungus has a long endophytic growth stage before becoming an aggressive pathogen. It poses the greatest threat to spring malting barley and resistant varieties are being developed. Disease management at present relies mainly on fungicide treatments, with correct timing being critical.

Reduced sensitivity of RLS to SDHI and triazole fungicides has recently also been reported from Ireland (ProMED-mail post 20180510.5792118). Rotating or mixing chemical classes of fungicides is recommended to counteract pathogen evolution and extend the useful life of any of the compounds. The related species _Ramularia beticola_ causes leaf spot disease on sugarbeet.

SDHI [succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor fungicides] are not new, their previous limited use meant that resistance under commercial conditions remained limited to a few pathogens and crops. A "2nd generation" of SDHIs is currently being used to combat fungal diseases that have developed resistance to other groups of fungicides. Triazole fungicides belong to the group of demethylation inhibitors (DMIs) which was introduced in the 1970's.

Strobilurins are strongly antifungal agents produced by fungi. Being derived from natural products, they are considered environmentally safe and are used worldwide as protectants against most major fungal plant pathogens. However, like several other fungicide classes, they have single-site activity and therefore pathogens must be expected to develop resistance or tolerance over time. Pathogen resistance to this important group of fungicides is of major concern to many primary industries worldwide.
