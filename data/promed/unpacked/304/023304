[Although Finland's last outbreak of anthrax was in 1988, it would be
useful to know whether it is the same general location. Once the soil is
contaminated with the spores, anthrax is endemic in that area. We would
appreciate receiving further authoritative information regarding this
outbreak. - Mod.TG]
