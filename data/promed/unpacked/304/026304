A total of 131 confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported to WHO by the China National Health and Family Planning Commission and one case by the Taipei Centers for Disease Control (Taipei CDC). Although cases have been reported in both sexes and across a wide range of ages, most cases have occurred among middle-aged and older men. 32 people have died, and most of the other cases are considered severe.

In addition to the case reported by Taipei CDC (with a history of recent travel from Jiangsu), cases have been reported from Anhui, Fujian, Henan, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shandong and Zhejiang, and the municipalities of Beijing and Shanghai. Much remains unknown about this virus, including the animal reservoir(s) in which it is circulating, the main exposures and routes of transmission, and the scope of the spread of this virus among people and animals. Investigations are ongoing, and evidence is inconclusive. Nevertheless, human infection appears to be related to exposure to live poultry or contaminated environments because:

- The virus in humans is genetically similar to that found in animals and the environment (live bird markets).
- Most human cases (approximately 3 out of 4 patients) report a history of exposure to animals, mostly chickens.
- The virus has been detected in poultry in live bird markets.
- The number of human cases appears to have decreased after closure of live animal markets. Whether other potential reservoirs of this virus may exist, including in other domestic and wild bird species, and mammalian species, has not yet been determined. And although 2 family clusters have been reported, there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission:
- Monitoring and testing of contacts (over 2000 people) of confirmed cases has detected few infections.
- Testing of more than 20 000 people with influenza-like illness (ILI) in March and April 2013 has confirmed only 6 infections with H7N9. This finding suggests that milder cases of H7N9 infection are not occurring in large numbers.

This is the 1st time human infection with the avian influenza A(H7N9) subtype has been detected. Previously, sporadic cases of human infection with other influenza A(H7) viruses have been reported which were associated with outbreaks of infection in poultry. The few A(H7) human infections that have occurred generally resulted in mild illness and conjunctivitis, with the exception of one death.

Genetic and laboratory characterization of avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses isolated from humans indicates that:
- The virus contains a group of influenza virus genes from multiple origins.
- Some genetic changes, including amino acid substitutions associated with increased affinity to alpha 2-6 receptors, suggest that H7N9 may have greater ability to infect mammals, including humans, than other avian influenza viruses.
- Sequence variations among the genes of the isolates suggest that there has been more than one introduction of this virus from animal into humans.
- Genetically, these viruses are, in general, expected to be sensitive to the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir but resistant to the antiviral drugs amantadine and rimantadine.
- The isolates have a haemagglutinin structure that is associated with low pathogenicity in birds. The virus has not been reported to cause severe disease in poultry. The absence of this signal limits the ability to easily detect the virus in birds, in contrast to avian influenza A(H5N1).

Risk assessment
---------
This risk assessment supersedes the document posted on 13 Apr 2013. It has been prepared in accordance with WHO's published recommendations for rapid risk assessment of acute public health events and will be updated as more information becomes available. The risk has not changed since the previous assessment.

What is the risk that more human cases will occur in the affected areas?

The understanding of the epidemiology of this outbreak and virus remains limited, including the main reservoirs of infection and the extent of geographic spread among animals. However, it is likely that most human H7N9 infections have been associated with contacts with animals or live bird markets. Further human cases should be expected. Other avian influenza viruses such as H5N1 have demonstrated a seasonal pattern in which human cases have been less frequent in summer months and more frequent in winter months. It remains to be seen whether H7N9 infections will follow the same seasonal pattern. Most human cases have resulted in clinically severe illness.

What is the risk of human-to-human transmission?

There is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. However, 2 family clusters suggest that limited human-to-human transmission may occur where there is close contact between cases and other people, as occurs in families and potentially in healthcare settings. Moreover, the genetic changes seen among these viruses that suggest adaptation to mammals are of concern, and further adaptation may occur. Should sustained human-to-human transmission occur with an increased number of clinically severe cases, health systems are likely to be strained.

What is the risk of international spread of H7N9 by travellers?

There is no indication that international spread has occurred. An infected person, whether symptomatic or not, who travels to another country could spread the infection. However, as the virus does not appear to cause sustained human-to-human transmission, extensive community spread is unlikely. If transmissibility were to increase, then the possibility of spread would likewise increase.

Does WHO recommend any travel precautions related to H7N9?

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions.

Monitoring Avian Influenza A(H7N9) Virus through National Influenza-like Illness Surveillance, China. (By: Xu C, Havers F, Wang L, Chen T, Shi J, Wang D, et al.)

Abstract
-------
In China during 4 Mar to 28 Apr 2013, avian influenza A(H7N9) virus testing was performed on 20 739 specimens from patients with influenza-like illness in 10 provinces with confirmed human cases: 6 (0.03 percent) were positive, and increased numbers of unsubtypeable influenza-positive specimens were not seen. Careful monitoring and rapid characterization of influenza A(H7N9) and other influenza viruses remain critical.

Introduction
----------
As of 28 Apr 2013, a total of 125 cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection and 24 related deaths were confirmed in humans in 8 provinces and 2 municipalities (hereafter called affected provinces/municipalities) of mainland China. The median age of patients was 63 years; most were male and had a history of exposure to live poultry. The 1st confirmed case was reported on 31 Mar 2013. On 3 Apr 2013, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) distributed primers and probes specific for avian influenza A(H7N9) virus to all national influenza surveillance network laboratories in China. To better understand the epidemiology, geographic spread, and clinical spectrum of this virus in China, we describe the Chinese National Influenza-Like Illness Surveillance Network (CNISN) and analyze data collected since 4 Mar 2013.

Outcome
--------
After the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus outbreak was identified in China, CNISN increased sampling and testing of ILI case-patients. CNISN has tested over 46 807 specimens from all provinces, including 20 739 specimens from affected provinces/municipalities. As a result of this testing, CNISN identified 6 influenza A(H7N9) virus-positive specimens in 5 provinces that were already known to have cases. These data demonstrate that avian influenza A(H7N9) virus is an uncommon cause of ILI in any age group and in the areas reporting confirmed cases of influenza A(H7N9) infection. The confirmed case-patients included 2 children who did not require hospitalization and 4 adults with more severe disease, possibly indicating that influenza A(H7N9) virus causes milder disease in younger persons.

Although the proportion of all outpatient visits for ILI increased in affected provinces/municipalities, virologic surveillance data showed that the proportion of ILI patient specimens positive for influenza decreased, and there was no increase in unsubtypeable influenza viruses during the study period. This suggests that any increase in the percentage of consultations for ILI might be a result of increased healthcare-seeking behavior after media reports of the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus outbreak or the circulation of non-influenza respiratory viruses.

The spectrum of illness caused by other avian influenza viruses varies tremendously and can also vary by age group. Previous human infections with avian influenza A(H7) viruses (i.e., subtypes H7N3, H7N2, and H7N7) have been generally mild, causing conjunctivitis, with the exception of very occasional cases of pneumonia and a single fatal case in the Netherlands in a highly exposed veterinarian (5-10). In contrast, avian influenza A(H5N1) virus has an overall case fatality rate of 60 percent, and persons with confirmed cases are usually severely ill. Recent reviews of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus seroprevalence studies found little evidence that large numbers of human infections are going undetected. Among the 82 human influenza A(H7N9) virus infections reported as of 17 Apr 2013, a total of 38 (46 percent) were in persons over 65 years of age. We did not find evidence of widespread mild disease, suggesting that the reported cases reflect the true distribution of infection and not a surveillance artifact.

Our study had several limitations. The 554 CNISN sentinel hospitals are located in urban areas, so the surveillance system may not detect influenza A(H7N9) virus infections in rural areas. In addition, most sentinel hospitals are tertiary care hospitals, and their patient populations are not representative of the general population with ILI. The distribution of those patients who had specimens tested is not necessarily random and may not reflect the population of those with ILI. Last, our system lacks a straightforward way to calculate rates of disease because it lacks denominators.

The emergence of a reassortant between avian influenza A(H7N9) virus and seasonal influenza subtype viruses, with possible increased human transmissibility, is possible during the upcoming summer influenza season in southern China. Careful monitoring and rapid characterization of influenza A(H7N9) viruses and unsubtypeable viruses from infected humans will be critical. Enhanced surveillance studies of mild and severe respiratory disease and seroprevalence studies in focal areas are necessary to further characterize the epidemiology and clinical spectrum of this emerging virus.

[The reporting of human cases of avian H7N9 influenza virus infection has declined noticeably in the past few days. To what extent this is due to differing procedures in reporting or an actual decline in case numbers is difficult to assess at this stage. The confirmed case count as of 9 May 2013 remained 131 in mainland China and one in Taiwan (ex China), and 32 deaths.

Likewise, there is some uncertainty about the range of response of the human population to H7N9 virus infection. Xu and colleagues [part 2 above] conclude, on the basis of their analyses of a large number of Chinese patients, that there is no "evidence of widespread mild disease, suggesting that the reported cases reflect the true distribution of infection and not a surveillance artifact. On the other hand, Cowling et al. in Euro Surveill. 2013;18(19):pii=20475 http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20475 reason, on the basis of preliminary statistical analyses of age-specific seriousness of human disease, that many unidentified mild influenza A(H7N9) infections may have occurred, with a lower boundary of 210-550 infections to date; see: ProMED-mail post "Avian influenza, human (74): China H7N9 update 20130509.1702261." - Mod.CP
