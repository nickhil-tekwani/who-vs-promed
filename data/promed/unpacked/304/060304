DRC: acute typhoid fever kills 16; 144 infected
-----------------------------------------------
16 people have died of an acute form of typhoid fever, and 144 others
have become infected in recent weeks in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC), a medical source in the capital, Kinshasa, told IRIN
on Mon 22 Nov 2004.
"We're talking about typhoid-fever complications called peritonitis,
which is created by the puncturing of the intestine of the sick
person, which could lead to death if the person is not treated in
time," Dr. Miandolo Miakala, a medical inspector, said. "There is a 9
percent death rate, 16 people among the 150 cases that we've recorded
in our hospitals in Kinshasa," he added. Miakala said the 1st cases
of the outbreak were recorded in early October 2004.
The WHO in Kinshasa has classified the situation as an epidemic. "We
are sending a team on the ground to conduct tests, determine the
causes, and map out the hot spots of the epidemic," Dr. Edmond
Magazini, the WHO head for Kinshasa, said.
Miakala said the cases stem from a typhoid epidemic that was ravaging
the city, a situation brought on by the town's cesspools, dirty
waters, and lack of proper hygiene. He said the government had
launched a campaign to clean the town's dirty waters, which had
reached "worrisome levels."
"In Kinshasa, some households use well water located next to
latrines; let's hope that it is not the main factor causing the
epidemic," Magazini said. "There are levels of typhoid fever;
unfortunately, there are a growing number of severe cases, with the
intestine rupturing within 2 weeks."
The government has already distributed antibiotics and other medical
equipment to hospitals to treat patients.

[Many of the complications of typhoid fever manifest during the 3rd
or 4th week of illness in untreated disease. Intestinal perforation
results from the hypertrophy, ulceration, and eventual necrosis of
Peyer's patches, the ileocecal lymphatic tissue. This complication
may occur in as many as 3 to 10 percent of untreated infections. -
