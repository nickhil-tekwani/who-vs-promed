Vesicular Stomatitis (VS) Update: 21 Colorado Quarantines
---------------------------------------------------------
The Colorado Department of Agriculture's State Veterinarian's Office has placed 21 locations under quarantine after horses tested positive for vesicular stomatitis (VS). The quarantines are located in Boulder, Broomfield, El Paso, Larimer, and Weld counties; results on additional tests in other counties are pending.

Colorado is the 2nd state in the country to have confirmed cases of VS. Previous positive cases of vesicular stomatitis in 2014 have been diagnosed in Texas.

"Vesicular stomatitis can be painful for animals and costly to their owners," said State Veterinarian, Dr. Keith Roehr. "The virus typically causes oral blisters and sores that can be painful, causing difficulty in eating and drinking."

Veterinarians and livestock owners who suspect an animal may have VS or any other vesicular disease should immediately contact State or federal animal health authorities. Livestock with clinical signs of VS are isolated until they are healed and determined to be of no further threat for disease spread. There are no USDA approved vaccines for VS.

While rare, human cases of VS can occur, usually among those who handle infected animals. VS in humans can cause flu-like symptoms and only rarely includes lesions or blisters.

Vesicular Stomatitis (VS) Signs and Transmission
------------------------------------------------
VS susceptible species include horses, mules, cattle, bison, sheep, goats, pigs, and camelids. The clinical signs of the disease include vesicles, erosions and sloughing of the skin on the muzzle, tongue, teats and above the hooves of susceptible livestock. Vesicles are usually only seen early in the course of the disease. The transmission of vesicular stomatitis is not completely understood, but components include insect vectors, mechanical transmission, and livestock movement.

[To find Boulder County in Colorado, go to http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/colorado_90.jpg; it is just north west of Denver and at the south west corner of Weld County. Weld County is on the northern state border and north of Boulder. Larimer is to the immediate west of Weld County. El Paso is south of Denver and contains the "A" of Colorado in this map. And Broomfield is tucked in between Boulder and Denver. As before, this disease is clustering as one would expect with a vector borne disease, and can only get worse. - Mod.MHJ
