This hemorrhagic fever has already killed 1 and sparked panic among the population of Kisangani in the province of Tshopo.

Coming from the town of Yakusu located 24 km from the city of Kisangani, downstream on the Congo River, the young man who died at the General Hospital of Kisangani in the province of Tshopo, showed symptoms of viral hemorrhagic fever such as bleeding and vomiting blood before his death. Given these signs, panic settled in the population fearing the emergence of a new outbreak of Ebola virus disease.

But the provincial health officer of Tshopo, Dr. Francis Baelongandi, [is] calling for calm. For him, as long as no result has yet been received on samples from the patient (collected and sent to the General Hospital, 7 Aug 2015, at the laboratory of INRB in Kinshasa) the public should not panic. He has also reassured that the situation is under control. For its part, the population will, he insists, observe the rules of hygiene.

"We ask the public not to panic. The situation is under control, and all measures have been taken to prevent the spread if the results proved positive. We await the outcome. Meanwhile, there are hygienic measures to be taken including regular washing of hands," he says.

Besides the observance of hygiene rules, Dr. Francis Baelongandi invites members of the public to go to the nearest health center if they find other similar cases with high fever, bleeding and vomiting.

[People have reason to panic about this case, because it could be a genuine case of Ebola virus disease. The DRC is known to be a focus of Ebola virus disease, the 1st cases occurred in this country, and the virus was described for the 1st time in the country. The health authorities have great experience in responses against Ebola, as there were several epidemics in country that have been managed masterfully. In the meantime, it is unclear whether this case is Ebola virus disease, and anyone with information is asked to assist us.

An Ebola virus disease outbreak that occurred in rural Equateur province beginning in July 2014 eventually killed 49 people before coming under control in November 2014. There is a lengthy differential diagnosis of hemorrhagic fevers, and results of laboratory testing are eagerly awaited. - Mod.LM]
