1st Report of Sour Rot of California Peaches and Nectarines Caused by Yeasts
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
T. J. Michailides & D. P. Morgan, Department of Plant Pathology,
University of California, Davis/Kearney Agricultural Center, 9240 South
Riverbend Ave., Parlier 93648; and K. R. Day, University of California
Cooperative Extension, 4437 S. Laspina Str., Tulare 93274. Plant Dis.
88:222, 2004; published on-line as D-2003-1205-01N, 2004. Accepted for
publication 18 Nov 2003.
In early July 2001, samples of nectarine and peach fruit were brought from
orchards in northern Tulare County or from packinghouses to our laboratory
for diagnosis of an unusual decay. When the decay lesions originated close
to the stylar end, leaking juice streamed from it. When the decay lesion
was on the stem end of the fruit and touched the packing box, it developed
a decay consisting of a ring of 0.5 to 2.0 cm (inner diameter) and 1.0 to
3.0 cm (outer diameter). The leaking juice dissolved the cuticle,
epidermis, and some of the flesh, creating distinct furrows in the tissue.
Samples with similar decay lesions were examined in 2001, 2002, and 2003.
In each year, isolations from these fruit consistently yielded 2 or 3
different yeasts that were identified as _Geotrichum candidum_ Link,
_Issatchenkia scutulata_ (Phaff et al.) Kurtzman et al., and Kloeckera
apiculata_ (Reess emend. Klocker) Janke. All 3 yeasts were isolated from
most of the samples, although sometimes, different combinations of 2 of the
yeasts were recovered.
To complete Koch's postulates, each yeast was single spored and cultured on
acidified potato dextrose agar at 25 deg C to prepare a dense (100 million)
cell suspension. 8 mature 'Elegant Lady' peach fruit were surface-disinfested
in 0.1 percent sodium hypochlorite for 3 min, allowed to dry, and wounded
once with a sterile nail (3 x 5 mm) on the fruit cheek. A 50-microliter drop
of the cell suspension was placed in each wound, and the peaches were
incubated in containers with >95 percent relative humidity at 27 deg C. Fruit
inoculated similarly with a 50-microliter drop of sterile water served as
controls.
In 2001, 2 containers containing 8 fruit each were used for each yeast, and
lesions started developing within 1 week after inoculation. The diameter of
the decay lesion was measured after 10 days of incubation of the fruit. The
diameter of decay lesions ranged from 21 to 68 mm for _G. candidum_, 30 to
55 mm for _I. scutulata_, and 9 to 39 mm for _K. apiculata_ inoculations.
The inoculation experiment was repeated with 2 containers of 8 'Red Glo'
nectarine fruit per treatment yeast, under the same conditions as described
above. Organisms recovered from the decay lesions were the same yeasts used
for inoculating the peaches or nectarines.
All 3 yeasts caused similar decay lesions in peaches, and the leaking
effect was reproduced in both types of fruit. Symptoms were similar to
those observed on fruit samples brought to our laboratory. Control fruit
did not develop the characteristic decay lesions, although brown rot caused
by _Monilinia fructicola_ developed on a few of the control fruit. We
concluded that each isolated yeast had the capacity to cause sour rot decay
on stone fruit.
From samples and reports, the disease has been found on 'Red Glo', 'Ruby
Diamond', 'Zee Grand', 'Spring Bright', and 'Honey Blaze' nectarines and
'Elegant Lady' and 'Fire Red' peaches. _G. candidum_ was isolated from
peaches and other fruit in California and incited rot of 'Paloro' peach in
1960 (2) and caused postharvest sour rot of peaches originating from
Georgia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and North Carolina (1).
However, to our knowledge, this is the first report of _G. candidum_, _I.
scutulata_, or _K. apiculata_ causing sour rot of commercial peaches and
nectarines in the field and postharvest situations in California.
