[According to a press release issued by the Dutch Food Safety Authority (NVWA), dated on 4 Jul 2017, the infected animal is a polo horse. Epidemiological investigations were initiated to try to identify the source of infection, including an investigation of contact horses which might spread the infection further, including at polo games in which the infected horse had participated.

Interestingly, some of the horses recently found to be EIA-infected in Germany were also polo horses; see ProMED-mail posting 20170629.5137416.

The following text was extracted from the introduction of an article titled "Equine infectious anaemia in Europe: Time to re-examine the efficacy of monitoring and control protocols?" published on 23 Jul 2015 in Equine Veterinary Journal. The complete document and references are available at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evj.12466/full.

"... Equine infectious anaemia [EIA] outbreaks have been reported in Belgium, Bosnia, Croatia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia and the UK between 2007 and 2014. In countries where EIA re-emerged after several years of absence such as in Belgium, Germany, Ireland and the UK, epidemiological studies suggested that equine biological products (such as blood plasma) imported from Italy or Romania were the source of the outbreaks. Moreover, several European countries (including Hungary, Poland and Serbia) have recently reported new EIA outbreaks and cases, underlining a wider extent of the disease in Europe than previously reported.

Recent outbreaks of EIA in European Union (EU) countries have prompted a closer look at the disease and alternative routes of transmission. Traditionally, EIA is seen as a blood-borne disease that can be mechanically transmitted by various blood-feeding insects, mainly Tabanidae. However, human actions (either iatrogenic or not) are suggested to have been an important contributory element, especially in recent outbreaks like the one in Ireland in 2006. In at least some of the EIA cases in the Irish outbreak (16 out of 38), it has been hypothesised that infection might have occurred through aerosolisation of infectious particles as a result of cleaning with pressure washers.

A few European nations reported EIA to the OIE between 2013 and 2014, namely Bosnia, Croatia, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Romania and Serbia. Two of these countries had ongoing (Romania) or have initiated (Italy in 2007) active surveillance programmes for EIA including systematic yearly testing of equids. Equine infectious anaemia is reported as endemic in the 2 EU countries that use systematic serological testing (Italy and Romania)..."
