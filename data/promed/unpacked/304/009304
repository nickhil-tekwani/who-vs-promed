The News Office of China's Ministry of Agriculture announced on 12
Apr 2010 that one outbreak of Type O Foot and Mouth Disease [FMD]
occurred in livestock in Linxia County in Gansu Province.

On 7 Apr 2010, some livestock raised by local farmers in Dujia
Neighborhood of Jiangjiazhai Village in Nanyuan Town of Linxia County
in Gansu Province's Linxia Huizu Autonomous Region exhibited symptoms
of suspected Foot and Mouth Disease [FMD]. 698 heads of livestock
(640 hogs, 58 sheep) fell ill. There were no fatal cases. On 12 Apr
2010, the National FMD Reference Laboratory confirmed Type O FMD
virus.

In accordance with emergency plans, the Ministry of Agriculture and
Gansu provincial government organized comprehensive response efforts
including closing off the affected area, disinfecting, and culling
1220 sick animals and animals from the same herds (including 831 hogs
and 398 sheep), as well as carrying out safe disposal. The outbreak
has been brought under effective control.

[This is the 2nd FMDV serotype O outbreak in Gansu and the 6th in
China since 22 Feb 2010; it is the 1st one involving small ruminants.
The previous 5 outbreaks (2 in Guandong, 1 each in Gansu, Shanxi and
Jiancxi) affected, reportedly, pigs and cattle. An official
'follow-up' notification has been sent to the OIE on 12 Apr 2010 and
is available, with map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=9135>.

According to the notification, out of 389 susceptible 'sheep and
goats,' and 831 susceptible swine, there were, respectively, 58 and
640 clinical cases, no deaths. All 1220 animals were destroyed.
Vaccination is, reportedly, still prohibited. The reasons for that
prohibition deserve explanation.

FMDV serotype O is traditionally known for its invasiveness,
affecting multiple species. The clinical diagnosis of the disease in
small ruminants, particularly sheep, are more difficult to diagnose
than in cattle and pigs; a description of the disease seen in this
event (Jiangjiazai village, Nanyuan, GANSU), will be interesting to
obtain. Have both sheep and goats been affected? What were their
respective clinical signs?
