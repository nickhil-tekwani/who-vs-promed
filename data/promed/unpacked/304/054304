In a meeting with the participation of the agriculture SEREMI [local ministerial unit] Pamela Betin, the labor SEREMI Federico Vengas and the health SEREMI Eugenia Schnake, they addressed the steps to follow after the latest known cases of hantavirus [infection] in the Los Lagos region.

In consultation with the health SEREMI about a possible new case of hantavirus [infection] in the region, Schnake mentioned that the latest laboratory report indicated that in Los Lagos, there are 9 known cases, the last being a 19 year old from Puerto Vargas who was taken to the Thorax Hospital in Santiago and who continues with a guarded prognosis.

The new case involves a 10 year old girl, but she comes from the Los Rios region, according to Schnake's comments.

[As with the previous cases that have occurred in the Los Lagos region, the report above provides no information about the circumstances under which the girl might have acquired her hantavirus infection, but it may have been due to exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta in this environment. Cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly frequently in the endemic region.

Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, including the Los Lagos region, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg.
