[I have combined a number of disparate messages in one. At most, it can be
said that they are all related to the mixed Japanese encephalitis
virus/Hendra-like virus epizoodemic in Malaysia. I trust our subscribers
will read them as such and not draw any conclusions as to relationships
between them. - Mod.CHC

THAI RESPONSE

Thai officials claimed that the country's southern provinces, bordering
Malaysia, are free of the deadly Japanese encephalitis virus, the Bangkok
Post reported Tuesday. The newspaper quoted Suwithaya Pollarp, Livestock
Department director-general, as saying that no report was received so far
about human or animal ailments resulting from Japanese encephalitis [virus
infection. But he also said that the country has beefed up its security
inspections at border provinces in the south to prevent an outbreak of the
disease, which has claimed at least 53 lives in neighboring Malaysia.
The outbreak of the disease has resulted in plummeting prices of live
animals in Malaysia. The price of live pig is quoted at 38 baht (1.02 U.S.
dollars) per kilogram, compared with 48 baht (1.29 dollars) per kilogram in
markets in the southern provinces of Thailand.
The Livestock Department has informed governors in border provinces to keep
a close watch, for fear that price differences could entice animal and
carcass smuggling to Thailand.
It is reported that although aware of the disease, pork consumption in the
southern provinces does not appear to have fallen yet. Some 15,000 live
animals are delivered to market in the southern provinces every month.
Last week, Thai authorities banned the import of pork from Malaysia,
following a similar decision by Singapore.

PHILIPPINE RESPONSE

The Philippine government will impose a total ban on the import of pigs and
pork from Malaysia and its neighboring countries within the next 21 months.
National Meat Inspection Commission (NMIC) Executive Director Edgardo
Dimalanta said in an interview the ban will be made effective during the
period to protect the local livestock industry and consumers from
pig-related Japanese encephalitis (JE) viral disease.
Dimalanta said agriculture regional offices and quarantine officers of the
Bureau of Animal Industry will also closely monitor all ports to ensure
Malaysian pigs and pork could not enter the Philippines. These measures
will be undertaken by the government while Malaysia is addressing the
outbreak of the JE disease, including fogging and vaccination of people and
pigs, he said.
Dimalanta said Malaysian pigs and pork will be only allowed from coming
into the country once there is already an official declaration from
International Organization of Animal Diseases these are already safe for
consumption.
The official said the government has also to conduct a risk analysis of the
disease once Malaysia applies as exporter of pigs and pork in the country.
The Philippines so far has no importation of such products from Malaysia.
It now only ships in pigs and pork from Europe, Australia, Denmark, France,
Holland and Canada.
[Why 21 months and not, say, 20 or 22? Still no mention of the Hendra-like
virus. When this is all over, someone surely will have to estimate the
economic cost of this epizoodemic, including that cost component resulting
from delayed accurate diagnosis. - Mod.CHC

MALAYSIAN NEWSPAPER HIGLIGHTS - MARCH 23, 1999

KUALA LUMPUR: An exercise to vaccinate 360,000 pigs in Negri Sembilan,
Selangor and Perak got under way today to curb the spread of the Japanese
encephalitis virus as authorities continued culling in the three major
outbreak areas of Bukit Pelanduk, Kampung Baru Sungai Nipah and Kampung
Sawah.
THE STAR - KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia and Thailand will launch a joint border
patrol operation on Thursday to curb cross-border smuggling. Defence
Minister Abang Abu Bakar Abang Mustapa said today the operation would be
based at Pengkalan Hulu in Perak. ALOR STAR: Prime Minister Dr Mahathir
Mohamad today called on the people to be mindful of "Greeks bearing gifts",
saying that foreigners were still trying very hard to undermine the country.
[Personally, I'd be fascinated knowing to what this alludes. Sounds a bit
paranoid to me but I do not keep up with internal or external Malaysian
affairs. - Mod.CHC
KUALA LUMPUR: Health Minister Chua Jui Meng assures that burial of pigs at
designated places in JE-high risk areas will not result in pollution of
water resources as they are not water catchment areas. Nevertheless, pig
culling squads were told to exercise care when disposing pigs' carcasses to
minimise pollution. Meanwhile, Chua also says culling of pigs will be
expedited as more army and police personnel will be despatched to speed up
the work.
BERITA HARIAN - KUALA LUMPUR: Meanwhile, Chua Jui Meng also says the new
Hendra virus will not be easily infected. Consumers and housewives could
still handle pork in the normal way. So far there is no report indicates
that the new virus could be transmitted [to humans through close contact
with pork.
KUALA LUMPUR: As [of 6 p.m, March 21, nine more people from Negeri
Sembilan were admitted to hospitals for suspected JE disease. One of the
victims died [at admission. Meanwhile, another pig farmer from Bukit
Pelanduk died in the University Hospital yesterday, bringing the death toll
to 36.
KUALA LUMPUR: Another 7,625 pigs were killed on the third day of pig
culling exercise bringing the total number of animals killed to 13,038 so
far.
CYBERJAYA: It is not possible for the government to compensate pig farmers
for the pigs destroyed. Nevertheless, arrangement could be made for a
special lottery draw to help raise fund for them. Dr Mahathir says the
pressing task ahead is to curb the spread of the JE and destroy all
infected pigs.
KUALA LUMPUR: Health Minister Chua Jui Meng says work to vaccinate
residents from JE-high-risk areas was hampered because pig farmers, farm
workers and Muslims in the nearby vicinity were reluctant to have
themselves vaccinated. He urges people not to listen to rumours but go for
inoculation for their own safety.
KUALA LUMPUR: Dr Mahathir says the government's decision to allow special
lottery draw was not to compensate farmers, but merely to help them pull
through the current difficult time. He reiterates that it is impossible for
the government to compensate farmers for each and every pig killed.
KUALA LUMPUR: Other than Pulau Pinang which had unilaterally banned
movement of horses into the state, no other states imposed similar ruling.
Director of health and epidemic unit of the Veterinary Services Department
Dr Abdul Aziz says the department has no plan to conduct check on horses as
it is inadvisable to take hasty action before one knows more about the new
strain of virus.
[The Hendra-like virus is one newly discovered, therefore must be a newly
discovered strain. It is not a new strain of JE virus because it is not at
all related to JE virus. - Mod.CHC

According to the health ministry, the death toll rose to 58 as of late
Tuesday, with another two deaths from a village in southwest Negeri
Sembilan. The virus first broke out in pig farms in the northern state of
Perak in October and was reported to have killed 15 people there before
spreading to Negeri Sembilan two months later.
Up to Sunday, 62,771 people had been vaccinated, 139,571 houses and 7,149
farms disinfected while 5,626 pig farms were inspected. More than 2,000
people have left their homes since the outbreak of JE, which is spread by
mosquitoes but harboured in pigs, began.
Health authorities said only 18 of deaths were so far confirmed to have
been caused by the JE virus, which causes inflammation of the brain.
Another encephalitis strain called "Hendra" -- discovered in 1994 when it
struck horses and humans in Brisbane, Australia -- has been found in some
patients. The Star newspaper said all 62 patients in hospitals nationwide
would be treated with the anti-viral ribavirin drug.
Eight members of the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and
two Australian experts have been called in to help curb the epidemic. So
far, CDC veterinary surgeon Tom Ksaizek and Australian animal health
laboratory project leader Hume Field have arrived.
Soldiers Wednesday continued the pig slaughter for a fifth day in three
villages in Negeri Sembilan. Around 327,000 animals are to be destroyed.
The culling operation resumed on Wednesday morning. Authorities had sent in
more troops on Tuesday and killed 6,770 pigs. This brought to 19,814 the
tally of pigs killed since the operation began on Saturday. Authorities had
planned to shoot about 35,000 pigs a day over 10 days.
The pig rearing industry, which earns 1.5 billion ringgit (US$395 million)
a year and employs some 300 000 people, has been crippled by the epidemic
as pork sales have slumped by nearly 70 percent.
[Still confusing JE virus and Hendra virus. My supicion is that this
confusion will be resolved within a short period of time, now that the
Australian and U.S. consultants have arrived to assist Ken lam and others
working on this epizoodemic problem. - Mod.CHC
