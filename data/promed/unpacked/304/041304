The state zoonoses coordinator of the Guanajuato Secretariat of Health [SSG], Miguel Angel Guerrero Chavira, confirmed that to date 296 cases of brucellosis have been registered, 96 of which are from Irapuato and 54 more from the town of Celaya.

After the cattle breeders association of Cueramaro warned about a possible epidemic of the disease, with 300 infected animals and 18 cases in people, the SSG official explained that the data handled by the Secretariat are issued after confirmatory testing of people who consult the health units, as the disease can be confused with others from a common cold to hepatitis.

Chavira said that in 2011 there were 512 and the municipalities of Celaya, Irapuato, and San Francisco were the most affected, so the intensive identification activities are permanent and will continue as normal, as the outbreaks of brucellosis in the state are not unusual. He said they are working in coordination and constant communication with SAGARPA [Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food] to identify infected animals, which are usually located in the south central part of the state.
