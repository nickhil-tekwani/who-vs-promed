During a survey on tomato viruses conducted in Serbia, virus-like symptoms were observed in July 2019 in tomato plants (_Solanum lycopersicum_) grown in 2 separate plastic tunnels in Jablanica district. Affected plants showed yellow angular spots on the leaves accompanied by necrosis and distortion, as well as fruit discoloration. In these 2 tomato crops, disease incidence was estimated at 80%.

Laboratory analysis (serological, molecular and biological tests) confirmed the presence of _Pepino mosaic virus_ (_Potexvirus_, PepMV - EPPO A2 List) in all tested symptomatic samples. Sequence analysis of the CP [coat protein] gene revealed that all Serbian PepMV isolates were identical among themselves and shared the highest nucleotide identity with an isolate from Spain. Phylogenetic analysis also showed that Serbian isolates belonged to CH2 (Chile-2 strain) but formed a separate subgroup within CH2.

[_Pepino mosaic virus_ (PepMV, genus _Potexvirus_) was first identified on pepino (_Solanum muricatum_) in South America. It is spreading in the Americas and Europe and has also been reported from a few locations in Asia and Africa. PepMV can also infect potato and aubergine, but serious symptoms appear to occur only in tomato. Symptoms may include blotches and scarification on fruit; mottling, distortion, necrosis on leaves and young shoots. The virus can cause significant economic losses, especially in glasshouse tomatoes, due mainly to reduction of fruit quality.

PepMV spreads very rapidly and is highly contagious. Specific insect vectors have not been identified. The virus is transmitted by mechanical means (including contaminated tools, human and insect activities, plant-to-plant contact), grafting and with infected plant material (including insufficiently cleaned seed batches containing contaminated plant debris). True seed transmission (that is, via the embryo rather than the seed coat) is uncommon in potexviruses and appears unlikely for PepMV, but more studies are needed. Disease management is usually focused on phytosanitation and use of certified clean seed and tomato explants.

Different strains of the virus exist for pepino and tomato. Coinfections have earlier been reported with _Potato virus S_ (genus _Carlavirus_) and _Tomato torrado virus_ (genus _Torradovirus_). Most recently, coinfection with the newly identified _Tomato brown rugose fruit virus_ (genus _Tobamovirus_) was reported (ProMED-mail post 20191029.6751082) and it was thought that the observed symptoms on tomatoes may have been due to either virus or to synergism. Further studies are needed to clarify the effect of these interactions of PepMV with other viruses on crop damage.
