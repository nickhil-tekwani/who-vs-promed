curl disease in Patna, India. Plant Dis 2009; 93(5), 545; DOI:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
During December of 2007, a severe leaf curl disease of tomato (ToLCD)
occurred in tomato-growing areas in the Patna District of Bihar,
India. Viral DNA was isolated from symptomatic tomato plants and
begomovirus association was confirmed by PCR. Cloned viral genomic
and beta satellite DNA could infect _Nicotiana benthamiana_ and
tomato test plants, which exhibited typical symptoms characteristic of ToLCD.

Full-length viral genome consists of 2752 nucleotides [nt] and showed
the highest identity (85.8 percent) with _Tomato leaf curl Laos
virus_. The satellite DNA-beta component consists of 1349 nt and
showed the highest identity (75.8 percent) with Tomato leaf curl
Joydebpur beta satellite. On the basis of the ICTV [International
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses] species demarcation criteria of 89
percent of DNA-A sequence identity, the present isolate was
considered as a new begomovirus species and named Tomato leaf curl
Patna virus (ToLCPaV). Since the isolated DNA-beta satellite shares
less than 78 percent identity, it is considered a new species of beta
satellite and the name, Tomato leaf curl Patna beta satellite
(ToLCPaB) is proposed.

These results show that severe ToLCD in Patna is caused by a newly
identified species of begomovirus and beta satellite.

[Ref: O Batuman et al: An outbreak of a necrosis disease of tomato in
California in 2008 was caused by a new ilarvirus species related to
_Parietaria mottle virus_. Plant Dis 2009; 93(5), 546; DOI:
10.1094/PDIS-93-5-0546C]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
During the 2008 early-summer growing season, virus-like necrosis
symptoms, most similar to those induced by _Tobacco streak virus_
(TSV), were observed in leaves, stems, and petioles of processing
tomato plants in the Central Valley of California [see ProMED-mail
post no. 20080820.2593]. Symptoms were observed in numerous fields in
Merced, San Joaquin, and Yolo counties, though the incidence of the
disease in most fields was not high (not more than 5 percent but over
20 percent in some areas).

Antibody-based tests of representative samples of the disease for
infection with _Tomato spotted wilt virus_, TSV, and _Tomato apex
necrosis virus_, which cause similar symptoms, were negative. A
putative virus-like agent was sap- and graft-transmitted to tomato
plants and induced necrotic spots in leaves and stem and petiole
necrosis symptoms that were similar to those observed in the field.
Eventually, these plants recovered from these symptoms. In
sap-transmission experiments, the virus-like agent induced systemic
symptoms in _Chenopodium quinoa_ and _C. amaranticolor_ (stunting,
leaf curl and necrosis), _Nicotiana benthamiana_ (necrotic leaf and
stem lesions), _N. tabacum_ cultivars Havana and Turkish (stunted
growth, necrotic etching, and ringspots followed by recovery for
Havana but not for Turkish), and _Datura stramonium_ (mild mottle and
ringspots in newly emerged leaves followed by recovery); no symptoms
were observed in inoculated common bean, pumpkin, pepper [capsicum],
and _N. glutinosa_ plants.

Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses of leaves from
noninfected and infected _D. stramonium_ plants revealed a protein
band of around 29 kDalton in infected but not noninfected plants.
Four peptides from the protein each had the highest match with the
capsid protein (CP) of _Parietaria mottle virus_ (PMoV), an ilarvirus
that induces leaf and stem necrosis in tomatoes in Europe.

Reverse transcription-PCR amplified the expected-sized fragments for
ilarvirus from leaves with the unusual necrosis symptoms. Sequence
analyses confirmed these were ilarvirus fragments. Partial RNA 1, 2,
and 3 sequences were 81, 84, and 82 percent identical, respectively,
with those of PMoV and 80, 77, and 69 percent identical,
respectively, with those of TSV. The amino acid sequence of the CP
gene was 86 and 61 percent identical to those of PMoV and TSV, respectively.

Together, these results indicate the necrosis disease of tomato is
caused by a new ilarvirus species, tentatively named Tomato necrotic
spot virus, although further studies are needed to confirm this. The
mode of transmission of this new ilarvirus to tomatoes in the field
is unknown, but it may involve thrips feeding on infected pollen, a
known method of transmission for TSV.

[Known species in the tomato leaf curl and tomato yellow leaf curl
clades of genus _Begomovirus_ cause similar diseases on solanaceous
crops and can lead to considerable yield losses. Begomoviruses are
transmitted by different whitefly vectors and many can also be
transmitted by mechanical means and grafting, but they are not seed
transmitted. Begomovirus control is particularly difficult in open
field crops due to the widespread presence and wide host range of
whiteflies. Disease management may include pathogen exclusion, vector
control, and elimination of possible pathogen and/or vector reservoir
plants. In some cases, crop cultivars with increased virus resistance
are available.

A number of new begomoviruses have emerged recently (see previous
ProMED-mail posts below). Some species can have extra-genomic,
virus-dependent satellite DNAs, which may play a role, for example,
in pathogenicity.

_Tobacco streak virus_ (TSV; genus _Ilarvirus_) affects a number of
crops, including bean, sunflower, peanut, maize, soybean, and a range
of vegetable and ornamental species. It is probably distributed
worldwide and has been reported to be spreading in North America and
Oceania. _Parietaria mottle virus_ (PMoV; genus _Ilarvirus_) has been
reported from Italy and Spain, and its hosts include parietaria weed
(wall pellitory; _Urticaceae_), tomato, bean, English spinach, basil,
and mungbean. Symptoms vary seasonally and include mosaic, mottling,
or necrotic patching on leaves.

TSV, like many ilarviruses, is transmitted by thrips vectors
(_Frankliniella occidentalis_ and _Thrips_ spp.). TSV can also be
transmitted by mechanical inoculation and grafting, and by pollen to
the pollinated plant; it is seed-transmitted in some species to
different extents, but is not transmitted by contact between plants.
PMoV is transmitted by mechanical means and grafting and no insect
vectors are known so far. The modes of transmission known for these
related ilarviruses will need to be tested for the new species
reported in item 2.

The species of _Chenopodium_, _Nicotiana_ and _Datura_ mentioned
above are widely used in plant virology as diagnostic indicator hosts.
