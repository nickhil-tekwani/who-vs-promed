The Oregon Zoo will begin treating 2 elephants this week for tuberculosis. One is Packy, the zoo's senior male elephant. Zoo officials had not previously announced that Packy had tested positive for TB.

"Packy has shown no signs of active TB," said Mitch Finnegan, the zoo's lead veterinarian. "But lab work on his blood indicates possible exposure, so it's better to treat this now than risk an active infection down the line."

The other is Rama, a male Asian elephant who zoo officials had previously announced tested positive for TB.

Neither elephant shows any sign of illness, zoo officials say. The treatment takes about a year.

The zoo routinely tests all its elephants for TB by collecting fluid from the animal's trunk and sending it to a certified laboratory for testing as part of its comprehensive health program and in compliance with U.S. Department of Agriculture standards. Following Rama's diagnosis last month [June 2013], each of the elephants was retested, with preliminary results coming back negative once again for all but Rama.

As a further precaution, the zoo also submitted blood samples from each of its elephants for testing, using the serologic Dual Path Platform (DPP) assay, a broad but useful screening test. In addition to Rama, Packy, was reactive to this assay, so his blood serum was submitted for further testing.

A more specific test known as MAPIA (multi-antigen print immunoassay) indicated possible exposure to TB. While only a positive trunk culture test is considered definitive, Dr. Finnegan, in consultation with the USDA, has recommended treating Packy as the most prudent course of action.

"For elephants, we are using the MAPIA the same way we'd look at a TB skin test for humans," Dr. Finnegan said. "It doesn't necessarily indicate active tuberculosis; it indicates exposure to the TB bacteria at some point in the past. In humans, only a small percentage of those who react positively to the skin test ever develop TB, and treating a latent TB infection reduces that risk even further. That's the course we'll be taking with Packy."

Dr. Finnegan said neither Rama nor Packy have shown any signs of illness, and although Rama is being kept apart from the herd during his treatment, no similar measures are needed for Packy at this time.

Zoo visitors were not at risk, according to Justin Denny, M.D., public health officer for Multnomah, Washington and Clackamas counties.

"Transmission of tuberculosis requires prolonged periods of close contact," Dr. Denny said. "So we wanted to make sure we tested anyone who spent time close to Rama. But as far as the general public is concerned, there is nothing to worry about."

It took until this month [July 2013] to amass enough medication to begin Rama's treatment regimen, which began on Tuesday [23 Jul 2013], but now that the medicine is on site, Packy's treatment can begin starting next week. The zoo's veterinary staff will monitor both elephants' progress through trunk cultures and blood tests during their prescribed treatment regimen.

[TB has been a problem in elephants and elephant relatives such as mastodons for centuries. The causative agent, _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, has been found in mastodon bones.

TB seems to be able to be passed between people and elephants, and certainly for veterinarians and animal care takers, the probability of TB transmitting from elephants to people is very real. However, in the few cases where a human skin test has been positive, it is in those people who are most closely associated with the animals and for the longest time.

The zoo is using the most recent and proven techniques for detection and treatment, and we wish the elephants and veterinarians and care takers great success.

More information on the progression of TB in elephants may be found at: http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_welfare/downloads/elephant/A%20Brief%20History%20of%20TB%20in%20Elephants.pdf.

Although human safety is of the utmost importance, protocols should be based on the best available scientific evidence with the welfare and rights of animals taken into consideration when possible.

Readers are encouraged to read the elephant tuberculosis (TB) FAQ at http://www.elephantcare.org/TBinfo.htm, which is excerpted here:

"Q: Do elephants with TB pose a danger to humans?
A: The greatest risk is probably to elephant handlers that have close daily contact. In one published report (Michalak 1998), 11 of 22 handlers had positive skin tests and one handler had active TB. Several other reports discuss the zoonotic aspects of elephant TB (Davis 2001, Maslow 1997, Montali 2001, Oh 2002). There have been no published reports of casual public contact with elephants resulting in TB. There is always a risk of disease transmission when there is contact with an infected animal or person. People who are immunocompromised are at greater risk.

The US Centers for Disease Control says: "To become infected, a person usually has to spend a relatively long time in a closed environment where the air was contaminated by a person with untreated tuberculosis who was coughing and who had numerous _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ organisms (or tubercle bacilli) in secretions from the lungs or voice box (larynx). Infection is generally transmitted through the air; therefore, there is virtually no danger of its being spread by dishes, linens, and items that are touched, or by most food products.

Q: Once treatment has begun, are there still dangers to others?
A: Once treatment is initiated it appears that elephants (like people) stop shedding [bacteria] within a few weeks and are probably not infectious to other animals or people.

Q: Can TB in elephants be cured?
A: We lack a good method to know for sure that elephants have been cured. X-rays are used in humans to evaluate lung lesions, but we cannot x-ray elephants, so serial cultures are used post-treatment. There is evidence that the MAPIA(TM) (multi-antigen print immunoassay) changes with treatment and may be a method to monitor treatment response (Lyashchenko 2006). A few elephants that were treated have died, and most (but not all) appear to have been free of TB when they were examined postmortem."

The elephants are also not in the active clinical phase, so they would not be shedding any bacteria, and once medication starts, shedding also stops. This should be adequate assurance for the safety of the public. In previous incidents of tuberculosis of zoo elephants in Australia and the USA, many times, the animals are still exhibited in open view to the general public.

The treatment for tuberculosis in elephants is through oral medication for one full year, and cost estimates range from USD 5000 to 50 000. Should the management not be able to afford this cost, perhaps some 3rd party or NGO will adopt or help subsidize the cost for treatment. Euthanasia should always be of last resort, and in this case, there are still other options.

Guidelines for the control of tuberculosis in elephants are available at http://www.elephantcare.org/protodoc_files/new2004/TB%20Guidelines%202003%20Final.pdf.
