Chikungunya, a relatively rare form of viral fever, has recently been
spreading throughout the Maldives and has been blamed for deaths in
both Male and some atolls.
Hospitals and health posts are reportedly packed across the country
with patients who have been diagnosed with the fever. One such
hospital, IGMH in Male, is so full that it is not admitting further
patients.
Health experts say the fever is being spread through mosquitoes and
that heavy rains over the last couple of months have increased the
number of those infected.
As a result, the Department of Public Health is now calling on the
public to drain every possible place or container that harbors
standing water, as they are favorable for mosquito breeding.
An official from the department said that as of 19 Dec 2006, 135
Maldivians had been suspected of being infected with chikungunya,
which also recently broke out in both India and Sri Lanka.
Despite the government's warning, some have expressed fear that the
Department of Public Health and the Health Ministry are playing down
the incident and do not realize the seriousness of the matter.
They blame the government's actions largely on the tourism industry.
If tourists are alarmed, they will not travel to the Maldives and
consequently, the country will lose money.
Chikungunya is generally not fatal. However, last year [2005], 200
deaths were associated with the disease on Reunion Island and India
(especially in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh).
The European Network for Diagnostics of Imported Viral Diseases
(ENIVD) claims that new phylogenetic variants of virus, which are
fatal, have also been identified on Reunion [see
<http://www.enivd.org/> - Mod.LM].
In the southern Indian state of Kerala, 125 deaths have been
attributed to chikungunya. Most of the casualties were reported in
the district of Alapuzha [mainly in Cherthala Taluk]. This latest
outbreak is supposed to have been transferred from Parassala, the
southernmost point of Kerala state, where a recent outbreak was
reported before the episodes of Alappuzha started. The Kerala
government has termed this an epidemic outbreak.

[Chikungunya is again sweeping Indian Ocean islands, this time the
Maldives. It would be of interest to know what mosquito vector
control measures are being taken to reduce _Aedes aegypti_ or _Aedes
albopictus_ populations on the affected islands. The Indian Ocean
islands have served as a source of chikungunya virus infection for
tourists who subsequently carried the virus to their home countries.
Most temperate zone countries to which infected tourists might return
are in the winter season, when mosquito vectors would not be active.
