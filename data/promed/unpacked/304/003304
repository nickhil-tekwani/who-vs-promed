Specialists of the Provincial Center of Hygiene and Epidemiology of Havana have reported an outbreak of hepatitis A in the San Miguel del Padron municipality in the village of Restaurante Cambute.

It is known that, so far, 60 cases have been diagnosed. The majority are elderly people. In some schools of the municipality, children with the disease have been found.

Viral hepatitis is characterized by high fever, vomiting, lack of appetite, and swelling of the liver, among other symptoms. The most serious pediatric cases were admitted to the Hospital Calixto Garcia.

A pediatrician at the Charity Isidron polyclinic, Antonio Guiteras, explained that the disease is attributed to the consumption of contaminated water and food. "Drinking water supply networks and [waste water systems] of this area are in poor condition and are mixed," he said. "We believe that the number of sick will increase."

[The diagnosis of hepatitis A is made in the laboratory by the presence of IgM anti-hepatitis A antibody. In general, elderly individuals in underdeveloped countries are not involved in HAV outbreaks, as most of the population has been infected, clinically or sub clinically, by age 10. Another water/foodborne hepatitis virus, hepatitis E, however, is more likely to affect adults.

San Miguel del Padron (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Miguel_del_Padron) is one of the 15 municipalities or boroughs (municipios in Spanish) of the city of Havana, Cuba. It is on Havana's southeastern outskirts. - Mod. LL
