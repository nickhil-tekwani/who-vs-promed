A 12-year-old gelding in Gloucester County, New Jersey, has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), the state Department of Agriculture (NJDA) reported 21 Sep 2018. This is the 5th confirmed case of EEE in New Jersey so far in 2018. The horse had not been vaccinated against EEE in 2018 and was euthanized on 13 Sep 2018, the NJDA said.

The other 4 cases in 2018 occurred in August and September and were in Monmouth, Ocean, and Camden counties. Each of those horses was euthanized as well. In 2017, officials confirmed 6 cases of EEE in New Jersey horses.

A viral disease, EEE affects the central nervous system and is transmitted to equids by infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs in horses include moderate to high fever, depression, lack of appetite, cranial nerve deficits (facial paralysis, tongue weakness, difficulty swallowing), behavioral changes (aggression, self-mutilation, or drowsiness), gait abnormalities, and severe central nervous system signs, such as head-pressing, circling, blindness, and seizures.

The disease can progress rapidly, with death occurring 2 to 3 days after onset of clinical signs despite intensive care in some cases. Fatality rates can reach 75% to 80%. Equids that survive might have long-lasting impairments and neurologic problems.

Studies have shown that vaccines can be effective in preventing both EEE and West Nile virus. Horses vaccinated in past years need an annual booster shot, but veterinarians might recommend 2 boosters annually -- one in the spring and another in the fall -- in areas with prolonged mosquito seasons. In contrast, previously unvaccinated horses require a 2-shot vaccination series in a 3- to 6-week period. Full immunity takes several weeks to achieve.

In addition to vaccinations, owners should work to reduce the mosquito populations and possible breeding areas and horses' exposure by removing stagnant water sources; dumping, cleaning, and refilling water buckets and troughs regularly; keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times (typically early in the morning and evening); and applying mosquito repellents approved for equine use.

In New Jersey, EEE, like other viral diseases affecting a horse's neurologic system, must be reported to the state veterinarian at 609-671-6400 within 48 hours of diagnosis. The New Jersey Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory is available to assist with EEE testing and can be reached at 609-406-6999 or <jerseyvetlab@ag.nj.gov>.

A horse in Oneida County has tested positively for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) and had to be humanely euthanized. EEE is a mosquito-transmitted virus like West Nile virus. A state lab confirmed the diagnosis. EEE is transmitted to humans, horses, birds and other animals through mosquito bites.

Oneida County Community Health Specialist Kyla Waksmonski says the virus can make humans sick, but is deadly for horses: "...With horses, it's fatal. With humans, about one-third of people who become ill with EEE die and then those people who survive have mild to severe brain damage."

The disease has claimed only 3 human lives in Wisconsin between 1964 and 2017. EEE typically has a fast onset with fever, headache, chills and vomiting. Horses lose their appetite and spirit, with drooping eyelids and lower lip, blindness, paralysis and death.

Horse owners can vaccinate their horses to prevent the disease. Waksmonski says although the mosquito season is nearing an end, it still is smart to take precautions to eliminate mosquito breeding sites on your property.

[Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is transmitted by mosquitoes. Horse owners should be using mosquito control approved for equines on their animals and in their barns. Equine owners should vaccine their horses. One injection given twice, 3 to 4 weeks apart protects the horse against EEE, West Nile virus and western equine encephalitis. The vaccine is very effective, easy to use and provides a lot of protection for little money. It is so much cheaper and easier to protect than to treat the horse when it becomes ill, and is so much easier on the owner vs the heartache of losing their animal. - Mod.TG
