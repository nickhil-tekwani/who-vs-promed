Fourteen Year Old Girl is Suspected vCJD Case
---------------------------------------------
Doctors are monitoring the condition of a girl aged 14 who may be the
first victim of the human form of BSE [i.e. variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease born after the condition was officially recognised in cattle.
All those identified as having variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,
abbreviated as vCJD or CJD (new var.), numbering 102 in Britain, 3 in
France, one (1) in Ireland and one (1) suspected in Hong Kong, were
born before November 1986, when pathologists at the government's
veterinary laboratories first identified BSE [bovine spongiform
encephalopathy.
Scientists are anxiously anticipating the first victim born after
brain, spinal cord and other offal were removed from food in 1989.
There is strong evidence that this ban was not properly enforced, and
that mechanically recovered meat -- another prime suspect for
infection because it was forced off cattle bones and contained nervous
tissue -- was allowed into cheap beef pies, sausages and burgers until
1995. At least one manufacturer also used it in baby foods during the
1980s.
The death toll from vCJD, though relatively low still, has been
growing rapidly in Britain. The first victim died in May 1995. By June
last year 60 had died and 10 were still alive. Now 94 are dead and 8
alive. The Irish victim and the still surviving Hong Kong woman
thought to have the disease both spent some time in Britain, whereas
none of the French victims had done so, suggesting either they ate
contaminated imported meat or meat from French cows that were infected
through imported feed or from a slumbering native epidemic.

[In late November 1999 ProMED-mail carried a press report stating that
a 13-year-old girl was suspected to be the youngest victim of variant
Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (vCJD) in the UK (see: CJD (new var.),
youngest human case - UK 19991124.2080). The girl was thought to be
displaying symptoms of vCJD. The report further stated that the girl
would have been less than one year old in 1986 when BSE, the cattle
disease thought to manifest itself in humans as vCJD, was formally
identified. In addition the report raised the question of whether the
girl might have been infected via baby food. The similarity between
this 1999 report and the present one suggests that the same patient is
described in both reports and that the diagnosis of vCJD has yet to be
confirmed. Consequently the speculation on the source of vCJD
infection should be interpreted with caution. - Mod.CP

Progress in Search for Drug to Combat CJD
-----------------------------------------
A world expert on prion diseases said on Wed 20 Jun 2001 that his team
is working with GlaxoSmithKline on developing a possible drug against
the fatal brain disorder, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Professor John
Collinge, of St Mary's Hospital, London, said "very promising" results
had been achieved in test tube studies.
Prions are the mutated proteins that are thought to be the cause of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). One type of the disease, variant CJD
(vCJD), has been linked to the consumption of meat from cattle
infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or "mad cow"
disease. Collinge said 150 000 potential drugs had been screened as
part of a research programme to find one or more drugs capable of
treating CJD. The strategy that we are following is to try and find
small molecules which bind selectively to the normal form of the
protein and prevent it being turned into the rogue form of the
protein.
Collinge said Our therapeutic target is to stop the process of
replication... the brain is not good at getting rid of prions. What is
going on in these diseases is that the rogue prion is being produced
more rapidly than the brain can get rid of. But if you stop
replication ... the brain can get rid of these prions quite rapidly.
It could get rid of half of them in a matter of a few hours. It could
probably, over the course of several days, clear the brain. That is
certainly what we have seen in xperimental studies. So the hope is
that if you block prion replication effectively using these
pharmaceuticals, the brain may be able to clear the remaining
materials over a period of the next days or weeks and the problem
would be gone.
Collinge stressed, however, that a diagnostic test must also be
developed in order to be able to identify infected persons before the
rogue prion proteins cause irreparable damage to the brain.

[ProMED-mail does not usually post claims about new drugs or vaccines
until they have passed their first human trials. However, the
statement from Collinge contains new information about the nature of
the human response to the vCJD prion. As indicated in the final
paragraph, drug therapy of CJD, vCJD and other neurological diseases
is unlikely to be feasible in the absence of sensitive and specific
diagnostic tests. - Mods.CP & JW
