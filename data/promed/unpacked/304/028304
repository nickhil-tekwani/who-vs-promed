PROPER USEAGE OF WORDS

Dengue/DHF - Cuba (12) 980412095948]
Can we encourage the proper use of the word "eradication". The author of
this report should use the word "eliminate" and not "eradicate". OK?

[Thirty years ago I bought a used station wagon from Phil Brachman and he
is probably grumpy because the thing still is running.
Gustavo Kouri had written (and I had moderated) Dengue/DHF - Cuba (12)
980412095948]:
"An intensive campaign for the control/eradication of _Aedes aegypti_, was
launched from the very beginning, although the human and material resources
were limited at the beginning."
"In the American region, Cuba is the only country in which dengue was
eradicated in the 1980s."
"In Caribbean countries ... it is of major importance that householders
take responsibility in eliminating breeding places [for the mosquitoes] ..."
My dictionary says "eradicate" means "to get rid of entirely, destroy
completely, extirpate, eliminate as in `Yellow fever has been eradicated in
the United States' and "eliminate" means "to get rid of or remove" as in
`We had to get eliminate the losing team from the competition'". As there
are a great number of words in my dictionary, each one meaning something at
least a bit different from all others, I assume these two words have
different meanings, else one of them would not be in there. The only
difference I can see is that "eradicate" means to destroy completely and
"eliminate" means to get the thing out of this particular place at this
particular time. However, I would appreciate it if Dr. Brachman would have
a cup of tea, then write to us with the definitive difference between
"eliminate" and "eradicate". Meanwhile, I am working on "exist" vs.
"occur". - Mod.CHC]
