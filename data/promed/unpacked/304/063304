Meningitis Kills 70 People In Huambo
------------------------------------
Meningitis has killed at least 70 people in Angola's central Huambo
province, since January, a health official said. Ribeiro Isaias, Head of
the hygiene and epidemiology section of the province's Health Services,
said the main victims were people under age 45. He disclosed that over the
same period, several medical centres in the province treated 376 cases of
the epidemic. According to Isaias, the Caala municipality, some 23 km from
Huambo, the province's chief town, is the worst affected, recording about
75 percent of the afflictions. He said a total of 834 people also died at
the Huambo hospital over the same period from various diseases, including
malaria, acute diarrhoea and respiratory complications.

[Angola is outside the "meningitis belt" of sub-Saharan Africa. Further
information about the laboratory characterization of the etiologic agent of
this outbreak would be helpful.
According to the GIDEON database, prior to 1986 fewer than 150 cases of
meningococcal disease were reported annually, except in 1977 when 1151
cases were reported. 173 cases were reported in 1986; 321 in 1987; 318 in
1988; 658 in 1989; 823 in 1990; 1106 in 1991; 1440 in 1992; 2260 in 1993;
3310 in 1994 (from Cuene, Huila and Lunda Sud Provinces); 1007 in 1995
(from 7 provinces).
An epidemic originated in Moxico (26 cases) in July 1996, and spread to
Cuanza Norte (at least 10 cases per day with 90% case-fatality rate), and
Lunda Norte.
1266 cases (129 fatal) of group A meningococcal meningitis were reported
during in 1998 - most in Bie, Malange, Lunda Norte and Huambo Provinces.
