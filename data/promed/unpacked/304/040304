[Cases continue to be identified with today's (29 Oct 2014) report, a major increase in a daily report; the last time there were more than 5 cases reported in a single day was back in May 2014; on 22 May 2014, there 7 newly confirmed cases reported, and on 20 May 2014, there were 6 cases reported. The 6 newly confirmed cases including one new death, bringing the total number of MERS-CoV cases identified in Saudi Arabia since June 2012 up to 786, including 334 deaths (case fatality 42.5 percent). These 6 newly confirmed cases include 3 from Taif, 2 from Riyadh and one from Hafr al Batin in the northern part of the Eastern Province. Of the 3 newly reported cases in Taif, 2 had a history of contact with suspected or confirmed cases in the healthcare environment, and the 3rd is a healthcare worker who did not give a history of contact with a suspected or confirmed case in the healthcare environment; unknown exposure is highly likely. Of the 2 newly reported cases in Riyadh, both had a history of contact with suspected or confirmed cases, one in the healthcare environment, the other in the community. The remaining case, reported in Hafr al Batin, had a history of exposure to animals. Hence, all 6 newly reported cases had a history of a potential high risk exposure.

Ten people have been hospitalised in the north after developing symptoms of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).

The Cyprus News Agency on Wednesday [29 Oct 2014] stated that the results of testing on the patients will be officially announced by the weekend.

Health services in the north of Cyprus went on alert on Sunday [26 Oct 2014] after an 83-year-old woman, who had recently returned from a pilgrimage from Saudi Arabia, died after developing symptoms of MERS.

MERS is a viral respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that was 1st identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. A typical case of MERS consists of fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The contagious disease has caused severe illness and even death in people from several countries since it was 1st identified.

[A reminder is that not all acute febrile respiratory disease manifestations are related to the MERS-CoV. It is possible that the returning Haj pilgrim did have exposure while in Saudi Arabia, but the identification of another 10 individuals as "suspected cases" would be the 1st time so large a cluster had occurred following confirmation of a single case in a country.

Cyprus is an island state in the Mediterranean, presently divided into 2 regions, a Turkish ruled state in the north of the island and a Greek ruled state in the south of the island. The area reported on in this media report is in the Turkish zone.

There has most likely been a heightened awareness of MERS-CoV in Turkey following the confirmation of a fatal case of MERS-CoV in a Turkish male returning from Saudi Arabia in the early part of October 2014 (see MERS-CoV (43): Saudi Arabia, new case, Turkey, WHO 20141025.2899029 and MERS-CoV (38): Turkey ex Saudi Arabia, fatal, RFI 20141018.2876430 for more details).
