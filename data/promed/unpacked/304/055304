Mess hall boss arrested for sickening Iraqi troops
--------------------------------------------------
Iraqi authorities have arrested the man in charge of the mess hall in
Numaniya, where hundreds of Iraqi police fell ill after eating their
evening meal on Sunday [8 Oct 2006], breaking their daily Ramadan fast.
Initial lab test results of the food and water suggest it was negligence by
the contractor, not an attack, Interior Ministry spokesman Brigadier
General Abdul Karim Khalaf said. The contractor was arrested, and the cooks
are being interrogated, he said.
Despite earlier reports, Khalaf said there were no deaths and that 450
police were sickened at the mess hall about 75 miles (120 km) south of
Baghdad. Previously, Kut hospital official had said 7 police died and 700
were sickened.

[Although this event is reported to be due to negligence, the cause of the
poisoning is still not identified. Likewise, it is hard to understand why
the hospital reported 7 dead and now they are not. Something does not seem
quite right. An authoritative report would be appreciated. - Mod.TG]
