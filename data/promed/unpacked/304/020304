["Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is the most contagious disease of mammals and has a great potential for causing severe economic loss in susceptible cloven-hoofed animals. There are 7 serotypes of FMD virus (FMDV), namely, O, A, C, SAT 1, SAT 2, SAT 3 and Asia 1. Infection with one serotype does not confer immunity against another. FMD cannot be differentiated clinically from other vesicular diseases, such as swine vesicular disease, vesicular stomatitis and vesicular exanthema. Laboratory diagnosis of any suspected FMD case is, therefore, a matter of urgency." http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.08_FMD.pdf

Although the information on FMD serotypes in Gambia is sparse, Gambia belongs to Pool 5 (West/Central Africa) where serotypes O, A, SAT 1 and SAT 2 circulate.

"Pools represent independently circulating and evolving foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) genotypes; within the pools, cycles of emergence and spread occur that usually affect multiple countries in the region. In the absence of specific reports, it should be assumed that the serotypes indicated below are continuously circulating in parts of the pool area and would be detected if sufficient surveillance was in place." http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/FMD_reports_GMR/May_GMR_2018_270618.pdf. - Mod.CRD
