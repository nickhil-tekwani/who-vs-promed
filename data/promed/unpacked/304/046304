2000/058 Present situation of beet necrotic yellow vein benyvirus in Sweden
(edited by DH)
Beet necrotic yellow vein benyvirus (EPPO A2 quarantine pest) was first
found in 1996 on three farms in Sweden and by 1999, a national survey
showed that rhizomania occurred in 26 farms located in four areas. The
following phytosanitary measures were taken on affected farms: 1) beets or
other host plants were not included in crop rotation more than once in four
years; 2) only resistant or tolerant beet cultivars can be grown; 3) beet
crops were harvested at the same time and the machinery was immediately
cleaned; 4) all beets were delivered at the same time to one sugar factory
(having appropriate water outlets); 5) beets were freed from soil as much
as possible; 6) and all agricultural machinery was cleaned before leaving
the farm.
Note: the EPPO Secretariat had previously no data on the occurrence of this
virus in Sweden.

[According to European sources
<http://www.fal.de/bgrc/genres42/resgen4.html>, sugar beet is grown on
about two million hectares in Europe. Major diseases include _Rhizoctonia_,
_Aphanomyces_, and _Pythium_ (seedling and root rot diseases), _Erysiphe_
(powdery mildew), and several viruses (beet mild yellow mosaic, beet yellow
vein virus and beet necrotic yellow vein virus, the latter which causes
rhizomania disease. Resistance is the only practical means of control, but
tolerant varieties are available. _Rhizomania_ is spreading in Europe; in
France, for example, 5900 hectares were infected in 193, and at present
about 48 000 hectares are infected. Naturally occurring resistance genes
are urgently needed as an alternative to transgenic cultivars which are
considered environmentally risky and unacceptable to some segments of
European society. - Mod.DH ......................................dh/es
