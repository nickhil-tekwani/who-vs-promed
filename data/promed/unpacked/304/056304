BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) - Hundreds of Iraqi policemen fell sick from poisoning
Sunday at a base in southern Iraq after the evening meal breaking their
daily Ramadan fast, and officials said they were investigating whether the
poisoning was intentional.
An official with the Environment Ministry said 11 policemen had died.
However, the governor of Wasit province - where the poisoning took place -
denied any deaths, though he said some of the victims were in critical
condition. There was no immediate explanation for the contradictory reports.
Some of the policemen began bleeding from the ears and nose after
the meal, said Jassim al-Atwan, an inspector for the Environment Ministry,
who was serving as a liaison in the investigation between the Health
Ministry and the base, located in the town of Numaniyah.
"Hundreds of soldiers were poisoned after taking food and water in the
iftar," Wasit Gov. Hamad al-Latif told the Associated Press, referring to
the meal that breaks the sunrise-to-sunset fast during the Islamic holy
month. "Investigations are under way to determine the cause."
Samples of the food and water were being tested "to determine the substance
in them" and will be sent to Baghdad for further tests, al-Latif said.
Sunni insurgents who have targeted police and military forces with bombings
and shootings have not been known to use poisoning as a weapon. But the
suddenness and severity of the sickness raised speculation that the
incident could be a new attack. The division is mainly made up of Shiites.
Between 600-700 policemen were affected to varying degrees, and 11 who had
the heaviest amount of the food had died, al-Atwan told The Associated Press.
Some of the soldiers collapsed as soon as they stood up from them meal,
others fell "one after the other" as they headed out to the yard in the
base to line up in formation, al-Atwan said.
Iraqi ambulances and helicopters sent by the U.S. military rushed the
policemen to hospitals in Numaniyah and the nearby city of Kut.
The afflicted policemen belonged to the 4th Division of the National
Police, nicknamed the "Karrar" Division, after a title of Imam Ali, the
most revered Shiite saint.
The division normally operates around the town of Salman Pak on the
southeastern outskirts of Baghdad - an area of intense Shiite-Sunni
killings. The division was sent to the base in Numaniyah, 60
miles southeast of the capital, for further training.
Al-Latif said food and water at the base are provided by an Australian
contractor working through Iraqi subcontractors. He did not identify the
Australian firm.

[This had to be a very rapid acting poison to affect this many people, this
suddenly. The fact that these people had been fasting may well have caused
the poison to act more rapidly as there was nothing in the stomach previous
to the carrier of the toxin. Cyanide comes to mind but the clinical signs
are not entirely consistent with this toxin. Sodium Fluroacetate is another
toxin that comes to mind, but again the clinical signs described in the
article do not match. �Mod.TG]
