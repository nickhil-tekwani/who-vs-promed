Climate-linked disease injures Alaska's salmon
----------------------------------------------
With a sickening thud, another hefty and handsome salmon lands in the
waste barrel, headed for the dogs. "See, it's all of the biggest,
best-looking fish," said Pat Moore. "It breaks my heart. My dogs
cannot eat all that. The maggots will get them first."

More Alaskan salmon caught here end up in the dog pot these days,
their orange-pink flesh fouled by disease that scientists have
correlated with warmer water in the Yukon River.

With global warming, cold-temperature barriers are giving way,
allowing parasites, bacteria, and other disease-spreading organisms
to move toward higher latitudes.

"Climate change isn't going to increase infectious diseases but
change the disease landscape," said marine ecologist Kevin D
Lafferty, who studies parasites for the US Geological Survey. "And
some of these surprises are not going to be pretty."

The emergence of disease in Alaska's most prized salmon has come as a
shock to fishermen and fisheries managers.

Alaskan wild salmon has been an uncommon success story among
over-exploited fisheries, with healthy runs and robust catches that
fetch high prices at fish markets and restaurants in Los Angeles, New
York, Tokyo, and London.

Fishermen and regulators who have cooperated to save species from
overfishing and local environmental hazards have been caught
unprepared to deal with forces beyond their control: how to manage a
fishery for climate change.

The return of the king -- or chinook -- salmon, the biggest of the
species, is eagerly anticipated along the Yukon.

Savvy buyers from Japan converge on the docks near the river's mouth
to purchase these fish that have bulked up with extra fat to swim
more than 2000 miles (3220 km), across Alaska, to spawn in the stream
of their birth.

As a fierce defender of the fish's reputation, Gene Sandone, a
regional supervisor for Alaska's Fish and Game Department, was less
than receptive to complaints from Tanana fishermen such as Moore that
something was wrong.

The chinook salmon they pulled from the Yukon River about 700 miles
(1127 km) inland didn't smell right. It wasn't an instant,
gag-inducing stench. It was more subtle but grew into an unpleasant
odor of fruit rotting in the hot sun.

More important, the flesh turned mealy. The salmon didn't dry right
in smokehouses either. Instead of turning into rich red strips of
salmon jerky, it turned black and oily like strips of greasy rotten mango.

"If you don't weed out the bad ones, it'll stink up the whole
smokehouse," Moore said, wielding a knife on his cutting table. "I
only want the good stuff. I don't want second-rate fish."

Salmon jerky strips are a staple among the Native Americans and
subsistence fishermen in rural outposts such as Tanana, a village of
270 people. "It'll keep you warm in the winter," said Lorene Moore,
Pat's wife and a native of the village. In Alaska's bigger cities,
these strips are a prized delicacy, fetching USD 20 or more a pound.

A friendly federal biologist advised the local fishermen that they
should send samples, including hearts and organs, which were covered
with tiny pimples, to the Center for Fish Disease Research at Oregon
State University.

The Oregon lab quickly identified the problem as "white spot
disease," caused by a microscopic parasite called _Ichthyophonus
hoferi_. Ich (pronounced "ick") is a well-known disease, harmless to
humans, that was blamed for devastating losses in the herring fishery
in Scandinavia.

A similar parasite can infect aquarium fish.

[_Ichthyophonus hoferi_, mentioned in the article above is a fungus
not a parasite. Furthermore, it may be inappropriate to call it
"white spot disease" as that particular disease is generally
referring to a parasite. _I. hoferi_, specifically, is large, 10-250
micron spores, which may germinate to form large hyphae. This fungus
is capable of infecting almost all fish. The description in the
article does not completely fit with the clinical description of the fungus.

_Ichthyophonus hoferi_ infected fish generally present in an
emaciated state with small, round, occasionally ulcerated black
granulomas in the skin. A scoliosis condition has been observed in
numerous fish affected by this fungus. The visceral organs have
numerous granulomas. These granulomas are usually encysted, large PAS
(periodic acid Schiff reaction)- positive spores, which may become
irregularly shaped hyphae. The mechanism of transmission is unknown.

In July and August 2001 a number of adult Atlantic salmon (_Salmo
salar_) from the Tuloma and Kola rivers (Kola Peninsula, Russia) were
found to have multiple hemorrhages on the skin, necrosis of the fins
and epidermis, extensive areas of scale loss, flat sores of 0.5-1.5
cm (0.2-0.6 in) in diameter and epithelial tumors. The muscles of
examined fish were unnaturally soft.

Symptoms of the disease are species-related and depend on the
condition of individual fish (Neish and Hughes 1980). For example,
Dorier and Degrange (1961) observed chaotic, spiral-wise movements of
diseased farmed rainbow trout, which develop when the nervous system
has been affected. Some individuals ceased growth and became
debilitated, while other, even severely affected, fish did not differ
from healthy individuals.

The symptoms of ichthyophonosis in Atlantic salmon are unknown. For
example, nodules were not found in the salmon examined. However,
external signs suggest that the development of symptoms in salmon
follows the pattern typical of herring. A certain distortion of the
clinical picture may be attributed to specific features of the
physiological condition and immune status of fish.

According to a number of authors infection of fish with _I. hoferi_
occurs during feeding on food containing viable spores of fungus
(Rucker and Gustafson 1953; Dorier and Degrange 1961; Lauckner 1984).
For example, Marshall and Orr (1955) referred to _I. hoferi_
(_Ichthyosporidium_) as a parasite of _Calanus_.

The fish in Alaska are not Atlantic salmon but Pacific salmon and
although it is tempting to say a salmon is a salmon, that is not
necessarily the case here. So clinical signs with this particular
species of fish may not be the same as with its Atlantic cousin, for
which even those clinical signs are not well known.
