A supplier to Inghams chickens in New South Wales, Australia, lost
thousands of stock months before the official outbreak of Newcastle
disease. Yet, neither Inghams nor the supplier notified the New South
Wales (NSW) Department of Agriculture about the highly contagious
and fatal poultry virus. The NSW Central Coast farm, which is now in
the center of an area comprising 12 infected farms, lost 20% of its
chickens. Industry sources said on 9 May 1999 that it would be normal
practice that a loss of this magnitude -- about 15 000 birds from the one
farm -- be reported to the department.
The department called in Gosford police on 6 May to help them with an
investigation that it had already started. It is an offence not to report an
outbreak of exotic disease. The outbreak, which threatens Australia's
$A1.4 billion chicken industry, has already cost producers and the NSW
Government tens of millions of dollars.

[Moral of the story -- one producer hoping to hide losses by not
reporting disease can cause a national disaster. ProMED-mail aims to
help avoid such catastrophes by giving early warning of outbreaks in
livestock & crops as well as in humans. If you know of an
undiagnosed outbreak near you, let us know - Mod.JW
