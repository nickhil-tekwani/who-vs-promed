Indian forest guards found the carcasses of 8 elephants, including 2
calves, that had apparently died of disease in a wildlife sanctuary, a
police spokesman said Tuesday. The dead elephants were found by a river in
the Nameri wildlife sanctuary, about 125 miles northeast of Guwahati, the
spokesman said. "They are believed to have died over the last 3 days. The
bodies were scattered on the riverside, when the forest guards
spotted them," the spokesman said. The absence of any injury marks on the
elephants suggested they had died of an illness, and a team of
veterinarians and forest officials were headed to the site to investigate
the deaths, he said.
Guwahati is the capital of India's northeastern state of Assam, home to
about half of India's estimated elephant population of 10 000.
