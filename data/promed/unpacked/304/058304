I have participated in the epidemiological evaluations of aspergillosis in
many hospitals. This would include several surgical wound problems. You
must find the source or the problem may not be solved. There are several
sources in OR's the most common is the air handling system but the
configuration of the fan and filtration is important to understand. Also
the autoclave rooms can be a source. Laundry has been implicated at times
but this does not seem to be your source? I wrote a chapter in the
Clinical Procedures Manual an American Society for Microbiology Publication
that suggests that levels should be less than 0.1 cfu/m^3. Honestly, with
good OR filtration levels of airborne microbes should be less than 1.0
cfu/m^3 when the OR is empty. The Committee on Operating Room Environment
published a microbial and particle levels many years ago and they are still
is applicable primarily because of people as sources of bacterial
contamination. Fungi can be local i.e. around sinks, leaks, janitors'
closets, fan coil units, gypsum board etc. Provide more detail and see if I
can assist you further.
