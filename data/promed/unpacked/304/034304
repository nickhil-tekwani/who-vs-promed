The Schmallenberg virus [SBV] has resurfaced in both Belgium and the Netherlands. This has been reported by the [Dutch] Animal Health Service (GD) and by the [Belgian] Animal Health Care Flanders (DGZ).

In East Flanders, an aborted calf was found last week with the typical signs of SBV infection, such as malformed limbs, neck and back.

In the Netherlands, GD reports that in recent weeks more questions about observed fever and diarrhea in cows have been received. Also, on multiple holdings the virus, or antibodies against it, have been demonstrated in collected blood samples.

Last year [2015], 4 cases of SBV disease were recorded in Wallonia [Belgium].

SBV initially appeared in 2011. In cattle, the virus causes fever, decreased milk production and diarrhea. In pregnant animals, the infection leads to abortions, still-birth and congenital malformations. In Belgium alone, hundreds of cattle, sheep and goat farms were infected in 2011 and 2012.

GD expects less obvious clinical symptoms than during the 2011 epidemic. The animals which were present during the 2011 epidemic are protected [immune], and younger animals may have been exposed to the virus, though to a limited degree.

The virus is spread by midges. There is little to be done against the virus. In terms of prevention, there is little to be done.

[In a similar article in the Dutch agricultural newspaper "Boerderij," the following additional information was included:

"An SBV vaccine has been registered but at present is not available. The virus-transmitting midges are most active around sunset time; gathering the cattle into their built facilities before sunset may be helpful in reducing infection."

When the SBV made its debut on the European arena in late 2011, Netherlands and Germany were the 1st to witness and report it, initially as a clinical event in adult dairy cattle discovered close to the German/Dutch border. The clinical signs, starting in August 2011, were mild and included hyperthermia, drop in milk production and, in some cases, also diarrhea and abortions. In November 2011, by means of a metagenomic approach, for the 1st time the Friedrich-Loeffler Institute (Germany) detected viral RNA belonging to a new virus in blood samples from clinically affected dairy cows. This new virus was called Schmallenberg virus after the place of origin of the collected samples. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that SBV belongs to the genus _Orthobunyavirus_ within the family _Bunyaviridae_.

Ortobunyaviruses are widely distributed in the world; mainly in Asia, Africa, Australia, and Oceania, in tropical and subtropical areas with a warm and humid climate. Their occurrence depends primarily on the presence of _Culicoides_ spp vector and a reservoir for the virus, which are diseased and infected animals. In Europe, since the 1st cases of SBV infection in 2011 until September 2013, the presence of SBV or specific antibodies were detected in 27 European countries, including 23 EU Member States (Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Hungary, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, and Greece) and 4 non-Member States (Switzerland, Norway, Russia, and Serbia). SBV infection was detected mainly in cows and sheep. Most affected farms were in France and Germany. SBV genome has been detected in bull semen; it remains to be clarified, however, whether the infection can be transmitted to dams by insemination.

SBV is not included in OIE's list of reportable diseases, but was reported as an emerging disease. No human health hazard by SBV has been detected to the present day.

The vector (_Culicoides_ spp) activity season is similar to that of bluetongue virus, starting in the summer until the cooler months. Since the current cases will affect young susceptible animals only, the dimensions of the event are expected to be limited, though its spread may include additional countries in north and central Europe.
