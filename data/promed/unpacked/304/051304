Disease has wiped out the entire population of rare Sumatran rhinoceroses
at a captive breeding program in Malaysia. The last of 7 Sumatran rhinos at
the Sungai Dusun Rhino Conservation Centre in central Malaysia died
yesterday, bringing to an end a 16-year program that is one of just a
handful in the world trying to save the species.
The Sumatran is the smallest of the world's 5 types of rhinos and among the
rarest of large mammals. Fewer than 300 are believed to be living in the
wild, mostly in Malaysia and Indonesia, and are being threatened by
poachers and loss of habitat.
Malaysian Rhino Foundation chairman Mohamad Khan Mohmin Khan said
scientists were trying to identify the exact cause of death, but a
pneumonia-like infection was suspected. Officials at the centre have denied
suggestions that the animals were kept in unhygienic conditions.
5 of the centre's 7 animals died in the past 3 weeks. "They became
inactive, then they started having difficulty in breathing, after that they
slowly lay down and it became difficult for them to get up," Mr Khan said.
"Some of them were with us for 16 years and we loved them very much."
The International Rhino Foundation said a small number of animals living
close to the conservation centre were particularly vulnerable to disease.
"Random events such as the deaths at Sungai Dusun are always a risk for
small populations, whether in the wild or in captivity," the foundation's
program director, Thomas Foose, said.

The sudden deaths of 5 Sumatran rhinos at a Malaysian sanctuary have dealt
a heavy blow to efforts to save the fast-dwindling species from extinction.
Since 29 Oct 2003, all 5 animals at peninsular Malaysia's Sungai Dusun
rhinoceros center have succumbed to what is believed to be acute blood
poisoning following bacterial infection.
The deaths throw a bleak spotlight on the state of the world's most
critically endangered rhino species and raise questions about Malaysia's
captive breeding effort, yet to bear fruit after 2 decades.
The country now has just 2 rhinos in captivity, in Sabah state on Borneo.
Habitat loss and the poaching of animals for their horns and skin, for use
in sex potions of dubious benefit, have taken a terrible toll on the
Sumatran rhino (_Dicerorhinus sumatrensis_). Only about 300 survive in the
wild in Southeast Asia.
Although Javan rhinos (_Rhinoceros sondaicus_) are rarer, wildlife experts
say their numbers have steadied at about 60 in Indonesia and a few in Vietnam.
He said the first of the 5 animals to die had just come in from a separate
paddock, suggesting that the infection might have been brought in from
outside the stalls.
Mohd Khan, who was on hand for Malaysia's first capture of a wild Sumatran
rhino in 1984, said, "We know captive breeding is possible from the success
of the Cincinnati Zoo."
