For the 3rd time in the United States so far in 2015, federal health officials are reporting a human case of novel influenza A virus infection. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the human infection case was reported by the State of Minnesota.

The person was infected with an influenza A (H3N2) variant (H3N2v) virus and was hospitalized as a result of the illness. No human-to-human transmission has been identified, and the case reported close contact with swine in the week prior to illness onset.

The CDC describes variant influenza viruses as follows:
When an influenza virus that normally circulates in swine (but not people) is detected in a person, it is called a "variant influenza virus." For example, if a swine origin influenza A H3N2 virus is detected in a person, that virus will be called an "H3N2 variant" virus or "H3N2v" virus.

Most commonly, human infections with variant viruses have occurred in people exposed to infected pigs (e.g., children near pigs at a fair or workers in the swine industry). In addition, there have been documented cases of multiple persons becoming sick after exposure to 1 or more sick pigs. Also cases of limited person-to-person spread of variant viruses have occurred.

[The 1st case of swine influenza in the USA in 2015 occurred in Minnesota on 30 Jan [2015]: a person was infected with an influenza A (H1N1) variant (H1N1v) virus, and fully recovered from their illness. The case patient reported contact with swine in the week prior to illness onset. A 2nd human infection in May 2015, with a novel influenza A virus was reported by Ohio (USA). The person was infected with an influenza A (H1N1) variant (H1N1v) virus and died from complications as a result of the infection. The patient worked at a livestock facility that housed swine but no direct contact with swine was reported in the week prior to illness onset. No ongoing human-to-human transmission has been identified in either case.

According to Avian Flu Diary [edited](http://afludiary.blogspot.com/), up until about 6 years ago the CDC received only 1 or 2 swine variant infection reports each year. In 2010, that number jumped to 8, and in 2011 to 12. In 2012 there were more than 300 cases -- mostly mild -- and nearly all associated with exposure to pigs at state and local agricultural fairs. The number of detections has dropped off markedly the past couple of years, but we continue to see sporadic cases.

While occasional cases are not particularly alarming, it is important to keep an eye on these viruses, because they belong to the same subtypes as do human flus (H1, H2 & H3), and presumably would need less of an evolutionary leap to adapt to humans than avian flu strains.

According to the CDC [edited] (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/keyfacts-variant.htm#variantinfluenza), human infections with variant viruses are of concern because influenza vaccines made against human influenza viruses are generally not expected to protect people from influenza viruses that normally circulate in pigs. In addition, because pigs are susceptible to avian, human and swine influenza viruses, they potentially may be infected with influenza viruses from different species (e.g., ducks and humans) at the same time. If this happens, it is possible for the genes of these viruses to mix and create a new virus that could spread easily from person to person. This type of major change in the influenza A viruses is known as antigenic shift. Antigenic shift results when a new influenza A virus to which most people have little or no immune protection infects humans. If this new virus causes illness in people and can be transmitted easily from person to person, an influenza pandemic can occur. This is what happened in 2009 when an influenza A H1N1 virus with swine, avian and human genes emerged in the spring of 2009 and caused the 1st pandemic in more than 40 years.
