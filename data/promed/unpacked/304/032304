Four Human Deaths Due to Rabies in Nepal
-----------------------------------------------------
On 9 Dec 1998 four people died due to rabies (hydrophobia) in Dang
district, Western part of Nepal. All of them were bitten by rabid dogs
a few months ago. Altogether 1000 people were bitten during this year
in that area. All of them were given Sheep Brain BPL antirabies
vaccine for 10 days. Even after completion of that vaccine series
four people died. This means there is a failure in vaccine potency.
***
This is the second time of vaccine failure. Few months back one
person died due to rabies even after giving that sheep brain vaccine
in Kathmandu.

[By "second time", I believe Dr Joshi means a second incidence of
vaccine failure, first in Kathmandu, and latterly in Dang. Whether
from the same or separate batches of vaccine has yet to be
determined - Mod.MHJ
[Apparent vaccine failures may be due to other factors than loss of
potency, e.g. wrong route of administration, bite on face or head,
lack of rabies immune globulin or equine anti-rabies serum to inject
around the bite wound. The human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV)
routinely used in Western countries is highly effective and has a
very low incidence of serious side-effects - Mod.JW
