Botulinum toxin F was found in industrially canned tomatoes linked to a case of botulism. It was registered in the republic of Mariy El, the branch of Rospotrebnadzor reported (Federal agency for protection of consumer rights and human wellbeing). The man had eaten tomatoes "Pomidorka" produced by LLC "Agro-Invest" (Kabardino-Balkaria) series 055N 5 N from 17/09/14. The staff of the Rospotrebnadzor have withdrawn this product from the store "Pyaterochka" [network stores which located in the many regions of Russia - Mod.NP]. Samples from other products of this manufacturer were taken for laboratory analysis.

[Although not alluded to in the posting above, it has been recognized that many cases of type F botulism including many of the infant cases are related to _Clostridium baratii_ and not _C. botulinum_. Microbiologically, _C. baratii_, if cultured from the stool of the infant or from a food source, is clearly differentiable from _C. botulinum_. The 2 type F toxins are similar but not identical. - Mod.LL
