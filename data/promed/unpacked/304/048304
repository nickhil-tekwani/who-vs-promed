A confirmed patient with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) expired here at the Holy Family Hospital [HFH] in August 2012. He was confirmed positive for this infection by the National Institute of Health, Islamabad in the afternoon of Thu 30 Aug 2012. The 65-year old male patient was brought to the HFH from a village in the area of Choa Sayden Shah, District Chakwal on 27 Aug 2012 with signs and symptoms of CCHF, while his history of animal handling was positive.

"After suspecting the patient as a case of CCHF, the HFH kept him in isolation while informing the District Health Officer Chakwal Dr. Nasir of his status for surveillance purposes," said the Chairman of the Infection Control Committee at HFH, Dr. Javed Hayat, while talking to The News on Saturday [1 Sep 2012]. He added that the patient's sample was sent to the NIH for confirmation, but he died of the deadly infection on Wednesday [29 Aug 2012].

In answer to a query, Dr. Javed said that the doctors and staff who received and provided initial treatment to the patient, and who may have been exposed to the virus, have been under observation. He added that none of the exposed staff members have developed signs and symptoms of the infection as of yet.

CCHF is caused by a _Nairovirus_ belonging to the family _Bunyaviridae_ transmitted to humans by the bite of the Hyalomma tick, or by direct contact with blood of an infected animal or human. CCHF was 1st described in Crimea in 1944 and identified in 1956 in Congo. The mortality rate of CCHF ranges from 50 to 90 per cent. Persons with CCHF virus infection experience headache, high fever, muscle pain and vomiting along with internal and external bleeding. Studies have revealed that the incubation period is influenced by the route of exposure. Infections acquired via tick bites usually become apparent after one to 3 days; the longest incubation period reported by this route is 9 days. Exposure to blood or tissues usually results in a longer incubation period. Current estimates suggest that these infections become apparent, on average, after 5-6 days, but incubation periods of up to 13 days are also known.

When asked, Dr. Javed said that there were lesser chances of transmission of infection following release of the dead body of the patient to his relatives. The hospital administration [bathed] the dead body of the CCHF patient and handed over his body to his relatives [shrouded] in a plastic bag. "Though the NIH confirmed the patient positive for CCHF a day after his death, the HFH took all necessary preventive measures, treating him as a high suspect," said Dr. Javed Hayat. The HFH on Saturday [1 Sep 2012] formed a committee to examine all contacts of the CCHF patient and to provide recommendations on what preventive measures should be taken by his close relatives and contacts, said Assistant Medical Superintendent Administrator Dr. Tariq Niazi when contacted by The News on Saturday [1 Sep 2012].

[In the past, there have been unfortunate incidents of nosocomial transmission of CCHF infection during treatment of patients in Pakistani hospitals. In the present case, appropriate safety procedures appear to have been in place.
