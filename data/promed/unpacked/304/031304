Unfortunately, the posting repeats a mistake that is becoming commonplace
when discussing the incidence of DT104.
The misstatement is made that, "In 1996, DT104 accounted for more than 30
percent of food poisonings caused by _Salmonella_ bacteria in the United
States."
The origin of the misstatement can be traced to the article by M. Kathleen
Glynn, et al, (New England Journal of Medicine, Vol. 338, No. 19, p.
1333-1338, May 7, 1998), Emergence of Multidrug-Resistant Salmonella
Enterica Serotype Typhimurium DT104 Infections in the United States. In
the article, the authors report that in 1996, 1,239 _Salmonella_ isolates
were serotyped. Three hundred six of the serotyped isolates were
classified as typhimurium; 103 of the 306 (34 percent) were resistant to
ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and tetracycline.
So 103 of the 1,239 _Salmonella_ isolates (8%), not 34%, were resistant to
the five antibiotics normally associated with DT104.
The article also states that, "Of 13 isolates with the five-drug pattern of
resistance that were phage typed at the CDC, 9 (69%) were identified as
DT104, 2 as DT104 complex, and 2 as having unrelated phage types."
Therefore, it is likely that a percentage less than 8% of the _Salmonella_
isolates were DT104.
