A young person died as a consequence of having contracted [a]
hantavirus [infection], which he acquired in the Quilmes area, where
he lived and collected food and bottles at the municipal incinerator.
The disease [virus] is common in rats, which eliminate the bacteria
[sic; virus] in its urine, which hit the man. This time, the victim
was a young 31 year old trash collector, father of a family, who went
several times a day to the municipal incinerator to collect bottles
and food, similar to dozens of people who continue to find objects to
sell, recycle and survive in the enormous trash dump.

In recent weeks he went daily to the dump, for which it is indicated
that it was there that he contracted the disease [virus] that began to
manifest itself on Monday 20 [Dec 2010], when he went to a medical
facility in the area where the diagnosis was not certain.

His mother explained that "he began to have serious respiratory
problems and was exhausted and very tired; 2 days later he was totally
incapacitated and could not move." He was taken to the Quilmes
Isidoro Iriarte Hospital. He had severe pneumonia and was treated as a
hantavirus [infection] case. Municipal officials, headed by the
Quilmes Secretary of Health, Sergio Troiano, visited the man's house
and proceeded to send the man's daughters and wife to the Eduardo
Oller de Dan Francisco Solano Hospital where they remained under
observation up to yesterday afternoon [30 Dec 2010], and were released
after finding that they were not infected with the disease [virus].

[This report does not indicate which hantavirus was involved in this
case. Since the clinical picture is compatible with hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome, rather than hemorrhagic fever with renal
involvement, the virus involved was most likely a New World
hantavirus, rather than the widely-distributed Asian Seoul hantavirus
found in _Rattus_ species, particularly in maritime port cities. As
indicated in ProMED-mail archive number 20060822.2370, hantaviruses in
South America are maintained in sigmodontine rodents.

Several hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in
Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy
rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like
viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown);
Lechiguana (in central Argentina in _O. flavescens_); Oran (in
northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western
Argentina in _O. flavescens_) virus. This case may have been caused by
Lechiguana virus infection, but without laboratory confirmation, it is
not possible to say with certainty.

The CDC has an excellent Power Point presentation on hantaviruses available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hanta/hps/noframes/hpsslideset/hpsslides1-12.htm>.

Quilmes is a municipality in the greater Buenos Aires area. A map can
