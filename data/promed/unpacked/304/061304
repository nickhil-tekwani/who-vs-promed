At least 13 people, 4 adults and 9 children, in Cabatangan village, Zamboanga [del Sur] have been referred for rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and are being monitored after eating infected dog meat, according to a Zamboanga report on [14 Mar 2015].

Zamboanga City Veterinarian Mario Arriola warned residents to take measures against eating infected meat because of the risk of the deadly virus. The rabid dog is known to have attacked a cat and 2 dogs in the area. [But see comment by Mod.AS below]

This situation is not unique to the Philippines. Last year [2014], a study by Nigerian researchers revealed that 5 percent of dog meat in the study area of Abia State was rabies tainted. Other countries that consume dog meat include: China, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, Philippines, Polynesia, Taiwan, Viet Nam, the Arctic and Antarctic, and 2 cantons in Switzerland.

The Animal Welfare Institute (AWI) says half a million dogs are slaughtered annually in the Philippines. The Philippine dog meat trade is primarily centered in the city of Baguio, in the northern Luzon Island province of Benguet.

A regional director of the Philippines National Meat Inspection Commission publicly stated that dog meat is not inspected by the Commission, and further called the consumption of dog meat "dangerous."

Concerning the rabies risk, AWI says on their website:
"Dog meat is additionally linked to the spread of rabies, a disease that kills approximately 10 000 dogs and 300 people per year in the Philippines. Evidence shows that rabies is present and potentially transmitted throughout all stages of the dog meat industry -- sourcing, trading, slaughtering, and consumption -- impeding efforts towards eradicating rabies in the region.

According to the Control of Communicable Diseases Manual, all mammals are susceptible to rabies. Raccoons, skunks, foxes, bats, dogs, coyotes, and cats are the likely suspects. Other animals like otters and ferrets are also high risk. Mammals like rabbits, squirrels, rodents, and opossums are rarely infected.

Rabies infected animals can appear very aggressive, attacking for no reason. Some may act very tame. They may look like they are foaming at the mouth or drooling because they cannot swallow their saliva. Sometimes the animal may stagger (this can also be seen in distemper). Not long after this point they will die. Most animals can transmit rabies days before showing symptoms.

Initially, like in many diseases, the symptoms of rabies are non-specific; fever, headache, and malaise. This may last several days. At the site of the bite, there may be some pain and discomfort. Symptoms then progress to more severe: confusion, delirium, abnormal behavior, and hallucinations. If it gets this far, the disease is nearly 100 percent fatal.

Worldwide, it is estimated that there are more than 69 000 deaths due to rabies annually.

[Zamboanga's local health department was giving all those who ate the meat the required 4 anti-rabies injections to ensure they did not develop the fatal disease, he added. They ordered the swift action as part of the government's effort to eradicate human deaths from rabies on 15 Mar 2015 (http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/article/1738667/philippines-orders-13-treated-after-eating-meat-rabid-dog).

Dog meat eating was banned in Manila in 1982, and nationwide in 1998 via Republic Act No. 8485, known as the Animal Welfare Act with exemptions for dogs killed and eaten as part of indigenous rituals. More recently, the national ban was bolstered by the Rabies Act (RA 9482), which upgraded penalties for convicted dog meat traders to include jail time and substantially increased fines as a means of limiting the spread of rabies. About 10 000 dogs and 350 humans die of rabies in the Philippines each year. Currently, the Philippines National Police and local authorities do little to enforce anti dog meat legislation and in fact many police and government officials in the Northern provinces eat dog meat themselves (http://www.networkforanimals.org/campaigns/the-philippines-dog-meat-trade).

Dog meat eating is a long-standing cultural phenomenon in some Northern provinces of the Philippines, traditionally associated with celebratory events and rituals of mourning. Historically the practice involved a relatively small number of animals killed and consumed, but more recently dog meat eating has proliferated for commercial rather than cultural reasons. Dog meat is still a popular delicacy that is eaten discreetly in certain quarters in Philippines.

Rabies transmission from consuming poorly cooked dog or cat meat has been reported from Asia, Africa, and South America. Humans may die from rabies after butchering and eating a rabid dog. Infection may also have resulted from butchering.

Adequate understanding of rabies by the public, increased awareness and management of the dog population in canine rabies endemic countries are essential to control the disease.

[The consumption of dog meat has been subject to criticisms for various reasons, including the suspected potential exposure of humans to rabies. It seems that such hazard has been repeatedly confirmed as long as concerning those engaged in the handling of the dogs prior and during their butchering and preparation while the hazard to consumers of dog meat is yet to be confirmed.

For example, in south China, where dog meat is widely consumed, the authors of a 2009 paper indicated that "up to now dog meat consumers are considered [of having] no risk of rabies infection". In 2006, the estimated number of dogs in China was over 75 million (Ref 1).

In southern Nigeria, stray dog trade fuelled by dog meat consumption was found a significant risk factor; human cases were described. However this did not refer to the dog meat consumers themselves. (Ref 2).

Information on scientifically confirmed rabies cases in consumers of dog meat (raw or cooked), if available, will be appreciated.
