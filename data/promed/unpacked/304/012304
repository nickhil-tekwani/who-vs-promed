A mom claims that her 10-month-old daughter developed a rash that covered her whole body while in the waiting room at Basildon Hospital [Essex, England] on 24 Nov 2018. "She had a rash on every part of her body. She had a rash in her ears and eyes," the woman, of Laindon [Essex], said.

The young mother was told her daughter had hand foot and mouth disease [HFMD] and was sent home that night with medicine. The woman took her daughter back to the hospital at around 6 p.m. the following day after [the baby] showed no sign of improvement.

"We were in the main [ER] outside the X-ray because she was contagious," she said. "[She] had not drunk anything or eaten all day. She didn't have any wet nappies and they didn't seem concerned." [The] mother claims they were left by staff waiting for 24 hours as the rash spread on her daughter's body. She also claims a nurse laughed when she told her [the baby] had only drank 2 ounces of water that day. The mother said she was disgusted by the way she was treated by staff in the emergency room. [The hospital apologized to the woman for her experience, which was caused by a busy ER.]

[The woman] and her daughter were waiting in the emergency room overnight before her daughter was taken to Puffin Ward at around 2:30 pm on [26 Nov 2018]. The baby stayed on the ward overnight and was discharged on [27 Nov 2018] and is now recovering at home.

[Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is a common infection caused by Coxsackievirus (CV-A16) and enteroviruses (EV-71). HFMD is highly contagious and is transmitted by nasopharyngeal secretions such as saliva or nasal mucus, by direct contact, or by fecal-oral transmission.

Child care settings are the most common places for HFMD to be contracted because of the bathroom training, diaper changes, and that children often put their hands into their mouths. Children who do not attend a preschool or kindergarten were found to be more susceptible to the disease. HFMD is contracted through nose and throat secretions such as saliva, sputum, nasal mucus, as well as fluid in blisters, and stool.

Early detection of HFMD is important in preventing an outbreak in the pediatric population. However, most cases are diagnosed clinically and lab tests are not indicated. If the diagnosis is unclear, a throat swab or stool specimen may be taken to identify the virus by culture.

The illness typically begins with a fever and feeling generally unwell. This is followed a day or 2 later by flat discolored spots or bumps that may blister, on the hands, feet, and mouth, and occasionally buttocks and groin region. Signs and symptoms normally appear 3-6 days after exposure to the virus.

Preventive measures include avoiding direct contact with infected individuals (including keeping infected children home from school), proper cleaning of shared utensils, disinfecting contaminated surfaces, and proper hand hygiene. These measures have been shown to be effective in decreasing the transmission of the viruses responsible for HFMD. Protective habits include hand washing and disinfecting surfaces in play areas. Breast-feeding has also shown to decrease rates of severe HFMD, but it does not reduce the risk of acquiring infection by EV-A71 (Koh WM, Bogich T, Siegel K, et al. Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2016; 35(10): e285-300; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5130063/).

Medication is usually not needed as HFMD is a viral disease that typically resolves on its own. Disease management focuses on achieving symptomatic relief for fever and pain. Infection in older children, adolescents, and adults is typically mild and lasts approximately one week, but may occasionally run a longer course. Rarely, viral or "aseptic" meningitis can occur with hand, foot, and mouth disease, but it is rare. It causes fever, headache, stiff neck, or back pain and may require the infected person to be hospitalized for a few days (https://www.cdc.gov/hand-foot-mouth/about/complications.html). HFMD is usually mild, with few complications, but the EV-71 HFMD strain can be fatal because of its severe complications, which include neurological, respiratory, and cardiovascular problems. It is also more infectious than the Coxsackie virus, the most common cause of HFMD.

HFMD occurs in all areas of the world. It often occurs in small outbreaks in nursery schools or kindergartens. Since 1997, large outbreaks of HFMD associated with enterovirus 71 have been reported mostly in children in East and Southeast Asia (https://www.cdc.gov/hand-foot-mouth/outbreaks.html). Outbreaks usually occur during the spring, summer, and fall months. Typically HFMD occurs in children less than 5 years old, but can occasionally occur in adults. HFMD should not be confused with foot-and-mouth disease (also known as hoof-and-mouth disease) which mostly affects livestock. - Mod.UBA
