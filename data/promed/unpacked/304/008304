Three members of the same family, all of them suspected of suffering from Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) are currently under observation at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS). One of the patients is a child, who was shifted from CDA Hospital to the Children's Hospital of PIMS [Tue 14 Mar 2017] night after manifestation of symptoms characteristic of CCHF. The other 2 are adults who are under observation in the main hospital's isolation ward.

A relative of the suspected patients recently died of CCHF; family history warranted that the 3 be ruled out for the disease. The blood samples of the victims have been sent to the National Institute of Health for verification. Hospital sources termed the patients as being out of danger.

[These are the 1st suspected cases in 2017 that have been admitted as suspected cases. The reference to the relative who died due to CCHF is significant, particularly if the case was laboratory confirmed.

An Epicore member requesting anonymity submitted the following information in response to an Epicore RFI; "Samples tested at NIH and declared as negative by PCR. The patient was diagnosed by the treating physician as affected of malaria by _P. vivax_." - Mod.UBA]
