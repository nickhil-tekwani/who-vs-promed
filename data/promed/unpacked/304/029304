Viet Nam: Two More Deaths Brings Total to 13
--------------------------------------------
HANOI: Viet Nam's death toll has risen to 13 after a six-year-old girl and
a 24-year-old man died from avian influenza in Ho Chi Minh City. Five
people have also died of the disease in Thailand, taking the Asian human
toll to 18. [In Viet Nam there have been 15 laboratory confirmed cases of
avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection, 13 of whom have now died, and in
Thailand there have been five cases, all of whom have died. As of Fri 6 Feb
2004, the total number of cases confirmed in East Asia is 20, 18 of whom
have now died. There have been no human cases in any other country in the
region. - Mod.CP]
Meanwhile, a UN agency [FAO] said tests revealed the virus in pigs, a
potentially disturbing development that highlights the risks to humans. A
day after China said avian influenza had spread to more provinces and UN
agencies chided Asian countries for being slow to sound the alarm, the Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said three or four pigs had tested
positive in Viet Nam. "Avian influenza A (H5N1) virus was in the nasal
cavities of the pigs," FAO Vietnam representative Anton Rychener said,
adding that blood samples had been sent to Hong Kong for further tests. A
Vietnamese official was unaware of any such finding.
Health experts had feared the virus --- ravaging poultry flocks in eight
countries with two more reporting milder strains --- would get into pigs,
whose immune system is similar to humans' and which suffer from a wide
variety of diseases that also infect people. Scientists say this makes them
ideal vessels for mixing genes from the bird flu pathogen and the human
influenza virus. The World Health Organization has said this could result
in the emergence of a new subtype of virus for which humans would have no
immunity. "If there was a very widespread infection in pigs, then that
would be a great concern that a pandemic strain might develop from it,"
Jacqueline Katz, a flu expert at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, said last week. However, Rychener said there was no cause for
alarm or for the banning of pig trading. The nasal swab result "does not
mean that the virus is in the bloodstream of pigs." The pigs were likely to
have been infected from digging their noses in dirt that was infected with
the virus, he said and suggested farmers separate pigs from chickens to
prevent infections.
Fifty million birds had been culled in Asia so far and poultry restocking
alone would cost some $150 million, said Louise Fresco, assistant
director-general of the FAO. Thailand, the world's fourth biggest chicken
exporter, which has slaughtered 26 million poultry, is confident it is
wiping out the virus. Deputy Prime Minister Somkid Jatusripitak said
Thailand had only one "red zone" left -- the five-km (three-mile) area
around a confirmed outbreak within which the government orders the
slaughter of all poultry. Last week, it had more than 140 in 29 of its 76
provinces.

Determination of the Structure of the 1918 Pandemic Influenza Virus
-------------------------------------------------------------------
WASHINGTON: The 1918 flu virus, which killed 20 million people around the
world, was probably so deadly because of a unique avian influenza-like
protein, U.S. and British scientists reported [in Science Express online]
on Thu 5 Feb 2004. Like the current outbreak of avian influenza in East
Asia, the 1918 pandemic influenza virus appears to have jumped from birds
to people with little change. But unlike the 1918 influenza virus, the
current avian influenza virus, which has killed 16 people, so far has not
developed the mutation that allowed influenza virus to decimate human
populations 80 years ago. Two teams of researchers analyzed samples of the
virus from the 1918 outbreak and said it bears the clear hallmarks of a
bird virus that mutated very little before jumping from birds to people.
Health officials in China, Thailand and Vietnam are scrambling to control
the current outbreak of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus. It is lethal to
people, which is often the case when viruses leap from one species to
another. In 1997 when it first appeared in Hong Kong it was contained very
quickly because it did not spread from human to human, but only from birds
to people.
So far this year only 16 people have been killed, but there is some
evidence [now discounted - Mod.CP] it may have begun spreading from person
to person. If that happens, experts fear the virus has the potential to be
as bad as the 1918 epidemic. Understanding just what it is about the
viruses that makes them deadly, and what makes them able to live and spread
among humans, will be key to controlling or pre-empting future epidemics,
the researchers noted.
Ian Wilson and colleagues at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla,
California and a team at the UK Medical Research Council Laboratory at Mill
Hill and the U.S.-based Howard Hughes Medical Institute looked at [the
haemagglutinin protein] of the virus extracted from the bodies of victims
[of the 1918 pandemic], some buried in Alaska permafrost and others saved
in laboratory jars. They looked specifically at the part of the virus
called the haemagglutinin, which is a protein the virus uses to infect
cells. Each strain of virus has a unique haemagglutinin structure, and
scientists believe small mutations of the protein are what allows the virus
to infect new species. They found it had some unique structures, but was
clearly more suited to avian hosts than to humans. These properties may
have given it "novel mechanisms" for infecting people, Wilson and
colleagues wrote. This may explain why the 1918 epidemic killed so many
young, healthy adults. And this explains why the current avian influenza
outbreak has, so far, not lived up to fears, said the MRC's John Skehel.
"Presumably, what's blocking this current flu from spreading
person-to-person is that its haemagglutinin structure has not yet evolved
such that it can efficiently infect humans," Skehel said in a statement.
Scientists say this probably happened with the 1918 influenza virus and
will inevitably happen again unless they are prepared to stop it in its
tracks. Studies like this one, they say, will help in designing vaccines to
quickly stop an epidemic before it can take hold. "This tells us more about
the transmission of infections from birds to humans," Skehel said.
"However, it will not have an immediate impact on the situation currently
unfolding in the Far East with avian influenza A (H5N1 virus, since from
our previous work, we know that the 1918 virus [with a H1-type
haemagglutinin] and the H5-type haemagglutinins are quite different."

Scientists Identify Key Factor in Switch from Birds to Humans
-------------------------------------------------------------
Scientists have solved a secret of an avian flu virus which killed up to 40
million people worldwide 86 years ago. They now know more about how a
disease of birds switched to humans to trigger the most lethal outbreak in
history. A team from the National Institute for Medical Research at Mill
Hill, north London, used pathological samples taken from victims of the
Spanish influenza pandemic of 1918 to recreate the structure of a
haemagglutinin protein vital in the leap between species. "This tells us
more about the transmission from birds to humans," said Sir John Skehel,
leader of the team. "However, it will not have an immediate impact on the
situation currently unfolding in the far east with the outbreak of avian
influenza A (H5N1) virus since, from our previous work, we know that the
[haemagglutinin of the] 1918 virus [H1-type] and H5 haemagglutinins are
quite different." The research is published in the online edition of the US
journal Science today. It is backed up by a study from the Scripps Research
Institute in La Jolla, California.
Viruses smuggle themselves into a host cell to replicate and then spread
infection. Haemagglutinin is a spike-like molecule on the surface of the
virus which sticks to receptors on the cells of birds or humans. The teams
worked with DNA [RNA - because influenza virus is an RNA virus - Mod.CP]
preserved in the Alaskan permafrost and in preserved tissue taken from
young American soldiers who died in 1918. The British researchers used
x-ray crystallography to determine the three-dimensional structure of the
haemagglutinin. The American team started from a different point and
studied the precursor protein that becomes haemagglutinin. Between them,
they have thrown light on one of history's great puzzles.

<http://www.sciencemag.org/sciencexpress/recent.shtml>. The abstract to the
first gives a better understanding of the virological basis for the
statements in the above press reports: "The 1918 'Spanish' influenza
pandemic represents the largest recorded outbreak of any infectious
disease. The crystal structure of the uncleaved precursor of the major
surface antigen of the extinct 1918 virus was determined at 3.0Å resolution
after re-assembly of the haemagglutinin gene from viral RNA-fragments
preserved in 1918 formalin-fixed lung tissues. A narrow, avian-like
receptor binding site, two novel histidine patches and a less exposed
surface loop at the cleavage site that activates viral membrane fusion
reveals structural features primarily found in avian viruses, that may have
contributed to the extraordinarily high infectivity and mortality rates
observed during 1918." These are undoubtedly important findings but it
remains to be established whether similar changes in the structure of the
H5 haemagglutinin molecule of avian influenza viruses will in fact be
accompanied by a change to transmissibility in humans. - Mod.CP]
