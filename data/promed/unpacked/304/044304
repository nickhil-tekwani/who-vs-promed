The Minister of Health of Central Darfur State has denied that there have been fatalities among children and donkeys suffering from a "mysterious disease" in El Salam camp for the displaced in Deleig.

In an interview with Radio Dabanga on Tuesday [25 Feb 2014], Eisa Mohamed Musa, Central Darfur State's Health Minister, strongly denied the deaths. He responded to a claim by one of El Salam camp sheikhs that 23 children and 59 donkeys did not survive the disease.

The Minister said that the cases were suspected to be whooping cough. He affirmed that samples were sent last week [week of 17 Feb 2014] to a referral laboratory in Khartoum for diagnosis. "We have not received the results so far." He stated that the ministry had received reports from the Deleig rural hospital about 12 cases of pneumonia among children. In total 15 pneumonia cases were recorded in February [2014]; 55 percent of these cases have not received vaccination, 33 percent have not completed their vaccinations, and 11 percent have not had vaccination because they have no vaccination cards. "The age of the children infected with pneumonia ranges between 1-5 years old. No one has died."

According to the Minister, the cases are limited to the area of El Salam camp, emphasising the absence of similar cases in other areas in Central Darfur. "The situation is now stable." He demanded from "those who claim there were deaths among children to report the details to the director of Deleig hospital." He advised the parents to ensure the vaccination of their children after they are born, telling them that "vaccines are available in the hospital of Deleig."

The Health Minister told Radio Dabanga that "the ministry is facing many challenges."

"We are short of medical staff, and of transportation means, in order to cover vast distances to remote areas in Central Darfur. In addition, we are in urgent need of a referral laboratory to be located in one of the states of Darfur to diagnose suspected diseases, instead of having to send samples to Khartoum."

Musa also pointed to "the problem of transmission of diseases from neighbouring Chad and the Central African Republic. But above all, the transmission of diseases in Darfur is associated with the seasons. Climatic conditions play an important role in the spread of diseases.

"Apart from this, many women have complicated child births. And many of them are suffering from urinary fistula."

The Minister stressed the need for citizens to pay attention to primary health care. "The people are not well informed about health issues. They do not understand the messages broadcasted via the local radio stations about timely vaccinations."

He called on "the citizens of Deleig in particular and of Darfur in general, to regularly visit the nearest health facility, medical centre, or hospital, whenever there is an outbreak of a disease. They should actively search for information, reports, and follow-ups about the symptoms, spread, and treatment of the disease."

[The Minister's denial of fatalities among children and donkeys in the El Salam camp adds confusion about the true nature of the situation there. The earliest report of 24 deaths among children came from North Darfur on 27 Dec 2013. On 12 Feb 2014, Radio Dabanga reported that about 75 percent of the children in Deleig camp, Central Darfur, were infected with a mysterious disease affecting children below the age of 12 years and donkeys. On 16 Feb 2014, a Deleig camp sheikh reported that 15 children and 47 donkeys had died. A 23 Feb 2014 report stated that the number of children who had died had increased to 23 and the number of fatalities among donkeys was 59. Perhaps a visit to the affected camps by medical NGOs would help to determine if these fatalities have occurred or not.

The Minister seems to be talking about illness in a different camp. Deleig is quite a long way south of Jebel Marra where the cases were reported in Nertiti camp, see map at http://wber.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/01/28/wber.lhq019/F2.large.jpg showing Garsela-Deleige in the NE corner of Wadi Salih province in the centre of the map and Nertiti in the top right of the map in Jebel Marra province (unfortunately there is no map scale provided). Recently, Zallingi & Wadi Saleh were incorporated into the new province of Central Darfur.
