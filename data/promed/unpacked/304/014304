SMS Gateway data collection in Bangladesh
-----------------------------------------
Bangladesh is conducting active Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza
(HPAI) surveillance in 150 out of 487 sub-districts as part of an
USAID funded FAO project. A total of 450 Community Animal Health
Workers (CAHW), 50 Additional Veterinary Surgeons (AVS) and 150
Upazilla Livestock Officers (ULOs) are using Short Message Service
(SMS) gateway (i.e., method of sending and receiving SMS messages
between computers and mobile phones) to collect data and report on
disease and death in poultry. Since October 2008, 21 HPAI outbreaks
out of a total of 35 have been detected through this active
surveillance programme.

The SMS reporting structure is rather simple: at the end of the
working day, each CAHW sends a SMS message with the total number of
all investigated poultry (chickens, ducks and other birds) and their
health status (the number of sick and dead birds) to the SMS gateway
system. This data is used to; A) monitor trends in disease and
mortality in poultry, and B) monitor who is working that day.
Additionally, CAHWs send flash reports by SMS on suspected outbreaks
according to a case definition. The system then automatically
contacts the ULO in the same area by SMS, who initiates an
investigation by sending an AVS or visits the suspect outbreaks
him/herself. After the investigation, the ULOs and AVS send a SMS
message to the gateway server to declare the suspect outbreak as
negative or report that it may require further (diagnostic) tests.

Initially a Gateway server receiving these messages was located at
the Department of Livestock Services in Dhaka, the capital. Currently
the system is Internet based. Specialised staff monitor the change in
mortality and morbidity rates and perform spatial and temporal
analysis against concurrent HPAI outbreaks and monitor the number of
suspect cases and the results of the ULOs and AVS investigations. The
result of the analysis is submitted to the Chief Veterinary Officer,
used in workshops to sensitise staff and farmers, donor meetings as
well as in periodic project reporting. This real-time reporting using
SMS has been contributing to effective HPAI outbreak response and
control. The key to the success may be its simple approach and
clearly defined work-sharing by using familiar tools (mobile phones).

[The above innovative methodology of an active disease surveillance,
missed by us when published on 30 Jun 2009, deserves attention. It
will be interesting to try to compare the results (and the
cost/benefit ratio) in Bangladesh with the participatory disease
surveillance (PDS) methodology, as currently applied in Indonesia and
Egypt. Details of the Egyptian and Indonesian H5N1 surveillance are
available in the same 60th issue of FAOAIDEnews, at the above URL.
For a useful presentation on PDS, including data from Indonesia, see:
