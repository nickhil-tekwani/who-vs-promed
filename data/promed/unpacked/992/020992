Signs of food poisoning in orang asli children
----------------------------------------------
Tests have shown that one of the 4 orang asli children who died under
mysterious circumstances had salmonella infection, which is one of the
commonest causes of food poisoning. "One child who died tested positive for
salmonella. We are still waiting for the other results from the Institute
of Medical Research. They could have suffered from amoebic dysentery,
cholera or typhoid," said health minister Datuk Dr Chua Soi Lek.
A news report on Sun, 26 Apr 2004 stated that 4 orang asli children died
between 9 and 12 Apr 2004. Their deaths affected the villagers so much that
they moved out and built new homes behind the Fan Tai Piu temple in
Tringkap. Speaking to reporters after attending the First Bilateral Meeting
of Senior Health Officials from China at the Institute of Health Management
here, Chua said blood and urine samples had been collected from children
suffering from diarrhea and vomiting in Kampung Pos Terisu and Kampung
Jarik Baru in Cameron Highlands. Dr Chua said the ministry had received 17
reports of such cases involving children in those 2 villages.
In Kuantan, Pahang Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Adnan Yaacob said a lack of
hygiene and drinking contaminated water were believed to have caused the
deaths of the children. Water samples taken from the area showed the
presence of bacteria and parasites.
He said it was too early to conclude the causes of the deaths, but a
medical team led by state Health Department director Datuk Dr Sarah Yaacob
would investigate the cases. "More than 80 samples had been taken from the
affected area, including Kampung Pos Terisu and Kampung Jarik Baru, and
from families whose children had died following bouts of diarrhea.
"However, the department only received results from 3 samples and all were
found to contain different bacteria and parasites," he told reporters after
the swearing-in of the Dewan Speaker and Pahang elected representatives.
Adnan said no new cases were reported and 12 children, aged between 8
months and 4 years old, were still in hospital. He said such deaths had
occurred many times in the orang asli community.

[The orang asli are the indigenous minority peoples of Peninsular Malaysia.
The name is a Malay term which transliterates as "original peoples" or
"first peoples". It is a collective term introduced by anthropologists and
administrators for the 18 sub-ethnic groups generally classified for
official purposes under Negrito, Senoi and Proto-Malay. They numbered 105
000 in 1997, representing a mere 0.5 per cent of the national population.
It is unclear at this time whether the cases are related in etiology and
whether the case number represents an upswing in the endemic rate of
gastroenteritis and diarrhea illnesses. - Mod.LL]
