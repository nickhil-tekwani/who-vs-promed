More than 4000 animals have been vaccinated after an anthrax outbreak in northwest Victoria.

Agriculture Victoria [AV] on [Mon 20 Mar 2017] said it was continuing to respond to an anthrax outbreak involving deaths across 4 sheep farms around Swan Hill. Victoria's Chief Veterinary Officer Charles Milne said there were more than 30 Agriculture Victoria staff working on the incident, most vaccinating susceptible animals on both 'infected' and 'at risk' properties. "There have been around 4300 animals vaccinated to date, including 4032 sheep, 109 cattle, 139 pigs, and 12 goats," Dr Milne said on Monday night [20 Mar 2017].

"Anthrax incidents commonly occur during the warmer months, when it's drier and the cattle and sheep forage deeper into the soil when eating grass." AV says there is no concern for the general public as anthrax does not spread rapidly and affected farms have been quarantined.

34 sheep died at a Swan Hill farm on [3 Mar 2017], with testing confirming anthrax was present in one of the sheep. Since then, another 3 properties in the area have been affected including one in Nyah [northern Victoria].

Anthrax is a bacterial infection that causes a rapid death once animals are infected.

For Nyah, Victoria, go to http://www.fallingrain.com/world/AS/07/Nyah.html (this has a better set of maps than the 1st map).

As the previous reports had only numerators -- animals dead, animals confirmed with anthrax -- and no denominators -- flock sizes -- it is hard to tell how far along the Victoria veterinary team is in protecting affected and neighbour's flocks from further cases. Anyway they have made a good start.

For those of you who have never vaccinated sheep, from my experience many years ago in Patagonia it is simple. You place your vaccinators shoulder to shoulder in the gateway exiting the corral (for example). The sheep come between the vaccinator's legs, held momentarily as they are vaccinated, and then released. Very simple. Very quick and easy. - Mod.MHJ]
