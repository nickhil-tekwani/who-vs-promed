[1] Case update
Date: Tue 6 Aug 2019
Source: Save the Children press release [edited]
https://www.savethechildren.net/news/ebola-death-toll-among-children-rises-above-500-save-children-warns


The deadly Ebola virus has taken the lives of more than 500 children in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Save the Children said today [6 Aug 2019], with the number of deaths accelerating over the past 6 months. In total, around 737 children have been infected with the disease since Ebola surfaced in the DRC.

Today's figures show how the spread of the disease has accelerated: in the 1st 6 months after 1 Aug 2018, just under 100 children died of Ebola. In the 6 months that followed, over 4 times as many children lost their lives.

Heather Kerr, Save the Children's Country Director in DRC, said: "This is another grim milestone in a crisis that is devastating children in its path, especially the youngest. Some 40% of children who have contracted the disease are under the age of 5, and many of them have died.

"The spread of Ebola is having a wider impact on children as well; because of the high fatality rate in this outbreak, thousands of children have lost at least one of their parents to the disease or were separated from their parents.

"The virus puts children at risk of being stigmatized, isolated or abandoned, in addition to suffering the unbearable trauma of losing a loved one. Children who are on their own face the very real danger of all kinds of abuse and exploitation, or of being recruited by armed groups.

Children aren't going to school because their parents have died and those taking care of them can't afford the school fees, or schools are closing due to insecurity.

The virus has been speeding up over the last 6 months instead of slowing down, and we're seeing a bad scenario unfolding right in front of us, as there are now four cases in Goma, a city of more than one million people.

The WHO declared this an emergency of international concern, and that should really mean the international community steps up its support. Contacts of the sick need to be traced, patients need to be looked after, the dead need to be buried safely and above all, trust needs to be built with the communities so that the message that Ebola is very real, and that it kills, is understood.

Notes to editors:
- According to the Ministry of Health, 507 children were confirmed to have died of the virus between 1 Aug 2018 and 1 Aug 2019.
- In the DRC, teams Save the Children has been responding since the 1st week of the current outbreak in August 2018, and has since reached 1 191 796 people, including 834 689 children.
- Save the Children has supported the MoH with Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) and Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) in health facilities, as well as assisting with community surveillance and the communication of Ebola prevention messages. Teams provided vital assistance with contact tracing, as well as supporting health facilities with IPC and providing Ebola prevention messages to communities.
- Our community mobilisation activities, through leader engagement and dialogue in the month of June 2019, reached more than 58 298 households and 245 234 people (including 110 355 children) with life-saving messages about prevention and detection of Ebola.

[These statistics on cases and deaths in children are distressing. The future for the children who survive will be very difficult for all the reasons discussed in the report. It is devastating to the communities affected to have so many children whose lives were cut short by this disease, on top of other diseases having a severe impact on them, such as, measles and malaria for example. - Mod.LK]

Situation update; data as reported by 4 Aug 2019
------------------------------------------------
Highlights
----------
The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces in Democratic Republic of the Congo continues at a similar transmission intensity to previous weeks. Since our last external situation report, with data reported up to 28 Jul 2019, 92 new confirmed EVD cases with an additional 59 deaths have been reported across the two affected provinces. There are currently no confirmed cases of EVD outside the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Hotspots continue to be the source of cases in other areas through the movement of suspected and confirmed cases and their contacts. This was observed on 30 Jul 2019 when a confirmed case was reported in Nyiragongo Health Zone on the outskirts of Goma city. This case-patient was a miner in Ituri and travelled to Goma through several hotspot areas. Two family members of the case-patient, a child and his spouse, have tested positive and are receiving care in the Goma Ebola treatment centre (ETC). There is currently no indication of an epidemiological link between these cases and the 1st case identified in Goma on 14 Jul 2019. All 256 contacts related to the confirmed case, who was reported on 14 Jul in Goma, finished their 21-day follow up period on 3 Aug 2019.

In the 21 days from 15 Jul through 4 Aug 2019, 68 health areas within 16 health zones reported new cases, representing 10% of the 664 health areas within North Kivu and Ituri provinces. During this period, a total of 260 confirmed cases were reported, with the majority coming from the health zones of Beni (46%, n=120) and Mandima (21%, n=54). The number of cases reported from Some Health Area in Mandima Health Zone continues to increase, with 74% (n=40) of the total cases observed in this health zone in the last 21 days. The response in Some Health Area was challenging for several weeks due to tension between local communities and Ebola response teams. The situation has recently improved following dialogues with community leaders to understand the community's perspective and to define common ground for collaboration.

As of 4 Aug 2019, a total of 2763 EVD cases were reported, including 2669 confirmed and 94 probable cases, of which 1849 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases with reported sex and age, 57% (1562) were female, and 28% (787) were children aged less than 18 years. Cases continue to be reported among health workers, with the cumulative number infected rising to 149 (5% of all confirmed and probable cases). 1 Aug 2019 marked one year since the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared the Ebola outbreak. UN partners reaffirmed our collective commitment to the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and called for solidarity to end the outbreak.

DRC reports more daily double-digit Ebola rises
-----------------------------------------------
The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) saw no let-up in Ebola cases over the weekend [3-4 Aug 2019], reporting 39 new cases, which would boost the outbreak total to 2763, according to updates from the World Health Organization (WHO) online Ebola dashboard.

Based on data reported for [2 Aug 2019], the DRC reported 17 more cases, and for [3 Aug 2019] the country reported 12 more infections. Health officials are still investigating 397 suspected cases

As of yesterday [4 Aug 2019], the online dashboard showed that the death toll was 1843, which is 20 more than the health ministry's last daily update, which was posted on [2 Aug 2019].

In the [2 Aug 2019] report, the health ministry said a sister of the 2nd case-patient detected in Goma who fled to South Kivu province has been found and 40 of her contacts have already been vaccinated, including 9 that are classified as high risk. Also, the ministry said a 25-year-old man who is a traditional healer is among the recently confirmed cases in Mabalako. He was vaccinated on [20 Jul 2019], but treated his symptoms between [24 and 29 Jul 2019], which gradually worsened. The man's infection was confirmed on [30 Jul 2019] and he has been taken to an Ebola treatment center. So far, 22 of his contacts have been identified.

Meanwhile, in other developments, a patient with a confirmed infection from Lubero who fled into the community in Masereka has been located and was transferred to an Ebola treatment center.

[3] Response
- Wed 7 Aug 2019. Rwanda: border control
[Xinhua News Agency, abridged, edited]
http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-08/07/c_138288888.htm
[Editor: Mu Xuequan]

Rwandan Minister of Health Diane Gashumba and her counterpart from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Pierre Kangudia met on [Tue 6 Aug 2019], agreeing to tighten border control to deal with cross-border movement, in a bid to prevent the spread of Ebola.

The 2 countries were committed to implementing preventive mechanisms to contain Ebola and secure cross-border flows in order to reduce the risk of the spread of the disease, said a joint communique issued after the meeting held in northwestern Rwanda's Rubavu district, which borders the eastern DRC city of Goma.

The 2 ministers discussed common mechanisms for the prevention and management of Ebola virus, including surveillance, according to the communique.

The meeting was convened in the context of ensuring a high-level political commitment that guides the strengthening of cross-border cooperation in disease surveillance, preparedness as well as response mechanisms between the 2 countries, it added.

[Byline: Glody Murhabazi]

The interim Minister of Public Health in DRC Pierre Kangundia Mbayi arrived in Goma this Mon 5 Aug 2019, to "absorb" the activities of the fight against the current Ebola virus disease in North Kivu and Ituri.

"We have come to encourage the field response team. We may not have time to go to Beni or other areas, but at least we'll see how the technical secretariat is organized here, in Goma," he told the press at Goma International Airport.

He also said he came to the tourist city to "take the grievances and make a roadmap for advocacy with partners so that all necessary means are mobilized to end this epidemic."

It should be noted that to date, the city of Goma, capital of North Kivu, has recorded 4 positive cases of Ebola virus disease are two deaths and two others under treatment.

Video: Working as a team to beat Ebola -- 2 days in North Kivu, the Democratic Republic of the Congo
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Team work is crucial in the struggle against the Ebola virus in North Kivu, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. For every alert about a new person potentially infected with the virus, it takes a team of specialists and volunteers to reach that person and the other people they were in contact with, to ensure they get to the care they need, the vaccine if they are eligible, and information on how to protect themselves. The World Health Organization, WHO, has been strongly involved in this response to the epidemic since it started in August 2018, as part of the action organised by the ministry of health of DRC with many local and international partners.

So much work goes into trying to stop #Ebola from spreading. Eg., more than 900 people have been vaccinated in the past week because they are considered at risk of having contracted the disease from the 3 [recent] Goma cases. ID'ing, finding & getting them to agree to be vaxed = ton [of] work.]

[4] Vaccine
- Mon 5 Aug 2019. Uganda: 2nd vaccine trial
[The Globe and Mail, The Associated Press (AP) report, abridged, edited]
https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-largest-ever-trial-of-second-experimental-ebola-vaccine-launched-in/
[Byline: Rodney Muhumuza]

Researchers in Uganda have launched the largest-ever trial of the experimental Ebola vaccine that is expected to be deployed in neighbouring Congo, where a deadly outbreak has killed more than 1800 people.

The trial of the Janssen Pharmaceuticals vaccine involves up to 800 people in the western district of Mbarara and is supported by Doctors without Borders and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

Pontiano Kaleebu, a Ugandan researcher who leads the trial, said [Fri 2 Aug 2019] that he regrets that the Janssen vaccine has not yet been deployed in Congo. The health minister there who stepped down last month had argued against its deployment, saying a 2nd vaccine could create confusion on the ground.

Already more than 180 000 people in Congo's yearlong outbreak have received an experimental but effective Merck vaccine, but health experts worry about the availability of doses as the virus now spreads in a major city, Goma, along the Rwanda border.

He warned that about half of the cases in this outbreak are going undetected and at that rate "this epidemic could last 2 or 3 years." The current goal is to strengthen surveillance and bring the detection rate to 80%, he said.

Health experts have watched with dismay as the promise of the Merck vaccine in this outbreak has been largely overshadowed by severe challenges to virus containment efforts including rebel attacks and community resistance in a part of Congo that had never experienced Ebola before.

The Janssen vaccine has already been tested in about 6000 people, most of them Africans, Kaleebu said. "We are excited about this (trial) ... because this is one of the promising vaccines," he said. "It's one of those vaccines that have shown a lot of promise in animal studies but also in other trials that have been conducted."

Ugandan researchers said the new trial is expected to last 2 years and will test how long any protection from Ebola would last. Juliet Mwanga, a co-investigator on the trial, said there is the need "to study many vaccines" in light of Congo's epidemic.

[Fierce Biotech, edited]
https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/gsk-offloads-ebola-vaccines-as-testing-j-j-shot-ramps-up]
[Byline: Nick Paul Taylor]

GlaxoSmithKline has licensed Ebola vaccines to the Sabin Vaccine Institute. The agreement coincides with the news that Uganda has begun testing a Johnson & Johnson Ebola vaccine.

GSK picked up the rights to vaccines against Ebola Zaire and Ebola Sudan in its 2013 acquisition of Okairos, which developed the candidates in collaboration with the US National Institutes of Health. GSK put the Ebola Zaire vaccine through two phase 2 trials but has now decided to hand it, the Ebola Sudan vaccine and a shot against the closely related Marburg virus off to Sabin.

To advance the vaccines, Sabin has formed a pact with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases' (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center. The partners plan to add to the body of evidence accrued on the vaccines to date, which includes the results from a third Ebola Zaire phase 2 run by a NIAID partnership.

"Sabin plans to continue the development and seek regulatory approval of Ebola and Marburg vaccines with our shared goal of making them available to the millions of people potentially at risk," Sabin CEO Amy Finan said in a statement.

News of the licensing deal comes shortly after Reuters reported on the progress of a 2-dose vaccination regimen of Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo. Uganda recently initiated a 2-year, 800-person trial of the vaccines. The clinical trial is taking place against a backdrop of fears that the Ebola outbreak will spread into Uganda from the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo.

Ad26.ZEBOV, which J&J acquired in its takeover of Crucell, is designed to provide protection against Ebola Zaire. MVA-BN-Filo, a multivalent vaccine developed by Bavarian Nordic, is designed to protect against Ebola and Marburg. In an earlier study, giving the vaccines in a prime-boost regimen showed promise, leading J&J and Bavarian Nordic to form a global license and supply agreement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background. As of 25 Feb 2019, 875 cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of Congo. Since the beginning of October 2018, the outbreak has largely shifted into regions in which active armed conflict has occurred, and in which EVD cases and their contacts have been difficult for health workers to reach. We used available data on the current outbreak, with case-count time series from prior outbreaks, to project the short-term and long-term course of the outbreak.

Author summary. Our models project that a final size of roughly up to 300 additional cases is most likely, and estimate that transmission rates are higher than would be seen under optimal levels of contact tracing and vaccination. While a catastrophic outbreak is not projected, it is not ruled out, and prevention and vigilance are warranted.
