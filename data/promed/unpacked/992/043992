Chickens in western Japan positive to bird flu test
--------------------------------------------------
Chickens shipped from a Japanese poultry farm where a bird flu outbreak is
suspected showed positive results to preliminary tests for the avian
influenza virus, a local government said on Saturday.
The chickens were among those shipped to a meat factory in the western
prefecture of Hyogo from a farm in nearby Kyoto Prefecture, where over 28
000 chickens have died since 18 Feb 2004, a Hyogo prefectural official said.
All the live birds from the Kyoto farm were thought to have been
slaughtered for meat products at the Hyogo factory, but some were found to
be alive and the prefecture conducted the preliminary tests on them on
Saturday, the official added.
The news raises concern of another outbreak, as there are live chickens
brought in from other prefectures at the Hyogo meat factory. It also puts
into question why the Kyoto farm had delayed reporting the death of the
chickens.
Health officials in Kyoto only received reports about the dead chickens at
the farm on Thursday, nearly a full week after over 1000 birds began dying
daily.
Japanese media said the initial tip-off was an anonymous telephone call.
As a result, some 15 000 chickens were shipped from the poultry farm by the
time initial tests for bird flu produced positive results, although none of
the meat reached the retail market, according to Kyoto government officials.
Japanese media quoted the head of the Kyoto farm as saying he thought the
chickens were dying of pneumonia and did not report the cases. Local media
said he had been questioned by the police on Saturday over the delay in
reporting.
Japan has confirmed 2 outbreaks of bird flu, the 1st in January 2004 and a
2nd last week [late February].
Both cases were found to be the virulent H5N1 strain of the virus, which
has been blamed for the deaths of at least 22 people in Asia.
There have been no reports of the virus infecting humans in Japan.
Earlier in February 2004, Japan declared an end to the 1st outbreak of the
flu, which hit the southwestern prefecture of Yamaguchi. The 2nd outbreak
was reported in Oita prefecture on the island of Kyushu, across a narrow
body of water from the site of the 1st outbreak.
Earlier this week, the government of Nagano prefecture in central Japan
also said it was checking on what could be a case of bird flu. A Nagano
government official said tests had been conducted on 6 birds kept as pets,
one of which died in suspicious circumstances.
No official confirmation has been made so far in Nagano.

According to current data, the death toll [on the Kyoto farm] has risen to
67 000 on Saturday. The farm included 198 000 chickens before the outbreak.

[The above reported mortality rate is not surprising; highly pathogenic
avian influenza (HPAI) may kill close to 100 percent of susceptible
populations. In the current case, the following figures have been recorded,
as they appear in the web-site of the Kyoto Prefectural Government
<http://www.pref.kyoto.jp/toriinf/040227_1900_suii.html> (in Japanese):
Date: 18 Feb 2004/19/20/21/22/23/24/25/26/27
Total chicken deaths: 101/118/1043/1063/1713/2123/2688/2300/7000(appx)/10
000(appx)
And, as reported in the above item, 68 000 dead chickens on 28 Feb 2004.
The gradual increase during the first days of the outbreak might explain
the difficulty of the owner in recognizing the problem initially. - Mod.AS]
