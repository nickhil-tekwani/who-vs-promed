[This appears to be the 2nd human case of avian influenza A/(H9N2) virus infection. Further information is awaited.

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) is, on 30 Dec 2013, investigating a confirmed human case of influenza A(H9N2) affecting a man aged 86 [see: Avian influenza, human (164): China (HK) H9N2 20131230.2143709.

The patient is a Hong Kong resident living in Huangbeiling, Luohu, Shenzhen [Guangdong province]. He has underlying illnesses and has developed chills and cough with sputum since 28 Dec 2013. Upon entry at Lo Wu Border Control Point (BCP) on the same day, he was transferred by ambulance directly to the Accident and Emergency Department of North District Hospital (NDH), where he presented with low fever. He was then admitted to the isolation ward. He was transferred to Princess Margaret Hospital today [30 Dec 2013] for further management. His clinical diagnosis was chest infection. He has been in stable condition all along and is currently afebrile. His sputum specimen tested positive for influenza A(H9N2) virus upon testing by the CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch. Investigations by the CHP revealed that the patient had no recent poultry contact, consumption of undercooked poultry, or contact with patients. His home contact in Shenzhen has remained asymptomatic.

Over 50 health-care workers of NDH and the ambulance service have been put under medical surveillance. - Mod.CP
