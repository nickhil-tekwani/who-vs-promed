YELLOW FEVER - BRAZIL (GOIAS): CORRECTION
*****************************************
A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.promedmail.org>
[see: Yellow fever - Brazil (Goias) 20000108132637]
Date: Tue 11 Jan 2000
From: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>

In the above referenced post, which I paraphrased from the Portuguese, I
mistyped the name of the director of the National Epidemiology Center of
Funasa. It should have been Jarbas Barbosa. I deeply regret the error,
which is contrary to the tradition of accuracy in reporting that ProMED-mail
is trying to establish. Dr Barbosa has been kind enough to contribute posts
to ProMED-PORT from time to time.
(Jarbas Passarinho, the name I typed, popped up out of my subconscious -- he
was governor of the state of Para when I was doing virus research in Belem,
Para, in the late 1960s).
