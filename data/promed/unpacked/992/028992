The United Nations humanitarian agency has warned of a cholera outbreak in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, and south central Somalia due to unhygienic living conditions, Press TV reports. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported a steady increase in suspected cholera cases from 9 Apr 2012 to 6 May 2012 in southern and central regions of Somalia. Banadir region in southern Somalia accounts for 49 percent of the 777 cases reported in this period, representing an 11 percent increase from the week before the end of April 2012.

OCHA says that although these figures do not suggest a major epidemic, there are serious concerns of an increased risk of a cholera outbreak in Banadir region and the Balcad and Afgooye corridors, where there is a high density of internally displaced persons (IDPs).

"Most of the cases are IDPs, because of lack of water," Wardhere Hassan of the American Refugee Council said.

Somalia remains one of the countries generating the highest numbers of refugees and internally displaced people in the world.

[2] Cholera - Ghana (Western Region)

The Jomoro District Directorate of the Ghana Health Service has appealed to government, benevolent societies and philanthropists to help acquire the necessary drugs to deal with the outbreak of cholera at Elubo. Madam Shallot Dankwa, Acting District Director of Health, made the appeal at Half Assini on Friday [18 May 2012] when he addressed the newly formed District Cholera Outbreak Rapid Respond Team.

Madam Dankwa said cholera cases at the Elubo Health Centre increased from 33 cases on 12 May 2012 to 110 cases on 17 May 2012, adding that 2 persons have so far died. She said 20 of the cases were brought from the Ivorian side of the border, adding that the outbreak was due to the pollution of the Tano River that serves as the drinking water for the people along it.

Madam Dankwa said drugs and other items for the treatment of cholera have run out at the Half Assini, and a request sent to the Western Regional Central Store at Effia Nkwanta in Sekondi for drugs has yet to receive attention.

Meanwhile, the directorate has started an awareness programme at the affected communities on the need to ensure environmental cleanliness and also urged them to boil their water before drinking it.

[3] Cholera - Zimbabwe (Masvingo Province)
Date: Thu 17 May 2012

http://www.voanews.com/zimbabwe/news/Health-Officials-Confirm-Cholera-Outbreak-In-Chiredzi-Amin-Water-Shortages-151928535.html


Officials in Masvingo province, southeastern Zimbabwe, have confirmed a fresh cholera outbreak in the sugar-producing town of Chiredzi which has killed 2 people since Mon 14 May 2012. About 100 cases have been recorded, and authorities are blaming the recurrence on serious water shortages.

The outbreak is particularly bad news for the town, which lost more than a dozen lives to the epidemic in 2011. Health officials have since deployed teams to administer treatment and assess the situation. Most people in Chiredzi rely on boreholes for drinking water, but many others use canal water meant to irrigate sugar cane plantations. Such water is highly susceptible to contamination.

Health officials said the fight to contain the disease is being hampered by serious food shortages in the area. Chiredzi Central lawmaker Moses Mare said the situation was tense as the population fears for the worst. He said the lack of properly working water purification pumps has heavily affected people in the area, as 2 pumps aren't functional, and the remaining pump has been stagnant.

Zimbabwe experienced a severe cholera outbreak beginning in 2008 that left at least 4293 dead by 2010. A deepening political and economic meltdown made it difficult for authorities to respond effectively.

District authorities have suspected an outbreak of cholera in Kalamb town, following the death of 2 senior citizens and hospitalization of over 50 persons.

Confirming the outbreak of cholera, Yavatmal Zilla Parishad CEO Navalkishor Ram said a team of employees from the district health department are moving door-to-door to create awareness among the people and also to identify patients. "Deployment of tankers has been ordered to supply potable water to the affected areas," he said.

The villagers have alleged that the pipelines supplying water to households in the town are old and that there are leakages at many places. "The water is being contaminated due to impure water mixing with the water in the pipe lines through the cracks. We have made complaints to the Gram Panchayat on a number of occasions but to no use," one villager said.
