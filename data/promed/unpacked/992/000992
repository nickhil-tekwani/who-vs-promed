Six freshly confirmed cases of deadly avian influenza virus were announced Fri [16 Jan 2015] by Kano State Ministry of Agriculture.

Briefing journalists, commissioner for agriculture and natural resources in Kano, Alh. Nasir Yusuf Gawuna said that 6 cases of the bird flu were confirmed of the 10 reported cases in the state.

Gawuna revealed that the virus was discovered in some commercial farms in 4 local government areas, including Kumbotso, Gwale, Tofa and Mingibir, insisting that the identification of the farms would not be disclosed for security reasons [see comment].

The confirmation further authenticated the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development's earlier detection of unusual high mortality of birds in 2 poultry farms and live bird markets in Kano.

The federal government said samples forwarded to the National Veterinary Research Institute tested positive for the H5 strain of avian influenza virus, otherwise known as bird flu, adding that confirmatory samples were sent to the International Reference Laboratory in Padova, Italy for further characterization.

However, the commissioner stressed that affected locations are currently being depopulated while [disinfection] had commenced but was quick to warn owners of farms and [market persons] to report suspected cases to the ministry for immediate action.

"We have [took action] on the suspected cases a few weeks ago, and we have commenced all necessary efforts to curtail further spread. Already, we have depopulated the locations for effective management. We earlier had 10 reported cases, but 6 are currently confirmed at various locations in 4 local government areas," Alh. Gawuna revealed.

The commissioner said government has constituted a committee of experts and professionals to work with the federal government team to map out a strategy to curtail the spread.

"We want to appeal to farmers to put fear of God in their minds and the danger of spreading this virus in the society. Farmers or sellers should please report any case or suspected case to government. Government would immediately move for necessary action, I can assure you about that.

"Government is ready to compensate any farmers whose animals are confiscated due to this virus. Already, our governor has directed immediate action and enabling to check the virus," Gawuna said.

[Nigeria has submitted to the OIE recently 2 reports on HPAI, one on 9 Jan 2015 (notifying a single outbreak on a backyard poultry farm in Kano; see 20150110.3083730) and the 2nd on 16 Jan 2015 (in Lagos; see 20150117.3097743). The latter report addressed an outbreak in a live bird market in Lagos which, apparently, had reportedly started 23 days earlier, namely on 24 Dec 2014. The distance between Lagos and Kano is about 800 km; this, and the current media report, are indicative of wide distribution of the HPAI H5 virus in Nigeria, a cause for grave concern. For further background, subscribers are referred to Mod.CRD's commentary in the earlier 2 posts in January 2015.

Refraining from the disclosure of the identity of the affected farms "for security reasons" is remarkable. Is this related to the precarious political situation in the Federal Republic of Nigeria?

Complete serotyping and genotyping results from the reference laboratory are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS
