The regional service of Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for Consumer
Protection and Human Welfare] has reported 19 cases of Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in the region [Stavropol territory]. 8 of
them contracted the infection in the course of their employment in
animal husbandry, and the other 11 contracted infection during
recreation in the countryside.

Tick-bites were responsible for medical consultation in 8575 cases,
2548 of whom were children. Employees of the public health advisory
service have been issued with protective clothing when spraying tick
repellant. The general population is being advised to seek medical
treatment immediately if symptoms of fever, muscle aches, and headache
are experienced.

[In a previous post Mod.NP commented that in the 2010 season: The
Federal Health Agency "Stavropol Research Institute Against Plague"
reported its analysis of the epizootic situation in Stavropol during
the past 2 years. The report stated that the climate anomalies
facilitated an increase in the numbers of ticks and caused changes in
their life cycle. Particularly, the developmental cycle of the vector
of CCHF, _Hyalomma marginatum_, was delayed by 30-45 days, and mass
emergence of their larvae started at the end of July 2011. As a
consequence the range of _Hyalomma marginatum_ was extended and new
territories in the west, northwest, and central parts of the Stavropol
territory were invaded. It seems likely that the same situation
pertains in 2011 and control of CCHF will depend on more intensive
disinfestation treatment of farm animals and grazing lands.
