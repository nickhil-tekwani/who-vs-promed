MacIntyre CR, Chughtai AA, Recurrence and reinfection-a new paradigm for management of Ebola virus disease (EVD), International Journal of Infectious Diseases (2015) http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2015.12.011

Abstract
Ebola virus disease (EVD) is an understudied infection, and many aspects of viral transmission and clinical course remain unclear. With over 17 000 EVD survivors in West Africa, the WHO has focused its strategy on managing survivors and the risk of re-emergence of outbreaks posed by persistence of the virus during convalescence. Sexual transmission from survivors has also been documented following the 2014 epidemic, and there are documented cases of survivors readmitted to hospital with "recurrence" of EVD symptoms. In addition to persistence of virus in survivors, there is also some evidence for "reinfection" with Ebola virus. In this paper, we reviewed the evidence for recurrence and reinfection of EVD and implications for epidemic control.

Highlights
1. Ebola virus may persist in various body fluids, resulting in reactivation illness.
2. Reinfection with Ebola virus may be possible due to waning or lowered immunity or high viral challenge.
3. With over 17 000 survivors in West Africa, precautions should be taken to minimise the risk of new cases and outbreaks.
4. Surveillance systems in high-risk countries should be capable of rapid detection and control of new outbreaks.

[Risk of new infections occurring is high as a result of possible persistence of virus in recovered individuals, making education and surveillance critically important to achieve control. Furthermore, research is needed to identify non-human animal reservoirs. - Mod.LK]

30 Dec 2015 Guinea: Ebola, the Executive Summary - 30 Dec 2015 [Ebola Deeply]
http://allafrica.com/stories/201512310726.html
[On Tue 29 Dec 2015, the World Health Organization declared Guinea as being free from Ebola virus disease (EVD) transmission, and it has been a long time coming because of the tenacious grip EVD has had on the country. According to Fode Tass Sylla, a spokesperson for the country's Ebola task force, "This is a very big victory for the nation and the people of Guinea."

As Guinea begins a 90-day period of close observation, the country is now able to accelerate the process of strengthening its health system.

According to Dr. Dan Kelly, who has treated patients in Sierra Leone, "We know Ebola is endemic in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, given that there's an animal reservoir of unknown origin in the region. It will always lie dormant in the areas of the world where previous outbreaks have occurred, and unless we drive the animal into extinction, we will never eradicate the disease."]

26 Dec 2015 Liberia: Ebola survivors research enrollment hits over 900
http://en.starafrica.com/news/liberia-ebola-survivors-research-enrollment-hits-over-900.html
[The Ebola Natural History Study, otherwise known as the Partnership for Research on the Ebola Virus Disease in Liberia (PREVAIL), has to date enrolled over 900 Ebola survivors into the Medical Study. The Partnership for Research on the Ebola Virus Disease Medical Study was launched 6 months ago targeting Ebola survivors. [1500 Ebola survivors are targeted for the Medical Study.]

31 Dec 2015 Liberia: Quantifying poverty as a driver of Ebola transmission
http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0004260

[Mosoka PF, Scrip LA, Gertler S, et al. (31 Dec 2015). _PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases_, DOI: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0004260. http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0004260

Excerpt:
Abstract: Poverty has been implicated as a challenge in the control of the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Although disparities between affected countries have been appreciated, disparities within West African countries have not been investigated as drivers of Ebola transmission. To quantify the role that poverty plays in the transmission of Ebola, we analyzed heterogeneity of Ebola incidence and transmission factors among over 300 communities, categorized by socioeconomic status (SES), within Montserrado County, Liberia...

...Individuals from areas of poverty were associated with high rates of transmission and spread of Ebola to other regions. Thus, Ebola could most effectively be prevented or contained if disease interventions were targeted to areas of extreme poverty and funding was dedicated to development projects that meet basic needs.]

24 Dec 2015: Russia officially registering Ebola vaccine
http://sputniknews.com/russia/20151224/1032238945/ebola-africa-vaccine-russia.html
[According to the head of Russia's consumer rights watchdog, on 24 Dec 2015 the documents for registering the Russian vaccine against Ebola virus disease (EVD) were officially registered. The Phase 1 clinical trials for the vaccine are in their final stages. In October [2015], the Russian Health Ministry said the recombinant influenza vaccine had been tested on around 200 volunteers and was "very well tolerated," with a low percentage of minor side effects."]

[It would be helpful to know what the minor side effects were and in what proportion of individuals they occurred. - Mod.LK]

[I wonder whether it will be approved by WHO & FDA, and who will buy it without WHO approval anyway? - Mod.JW]

31 Dec 2015: Special report: Ebola's thin harvest
http://news.sciencemag.org/health/2015/12/special-report-ebolas-thin-harvest
[An interesting article addressing the fate of Ebola virus disease (EVD) treatments/vaccines, addressing the status of the clinical trials, focusing on the lack of information regarding the sometimes ambiguous reasons for ending the trials.

Excerpt:
Results of Ebola virus disease vaccine trials to date:

- Brincidofovir (Liberia): Stopped by Chimerix after 4 patients, reasons unclear.
- Favipiravir (Guinea): Completed, more than 200 patients included, putative signal of efficacy.
- Plasma (Liberia): Stopped after 6 patients. (Sierra Leone): Stopped after 3 patients. (Guinea): Completed, 102 patients included.
- Whole blood (Liberia): Stopped, status unclear.
- ZMapp (Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, USA): About 70 patients enrolled in ongoing RCT (Randomized control trial).
- TKM-Ebola (Sierra Leone): Stopped after 14 patients, drug deemed unlikely to work.
- Interferon-beta (Guinea): Stopped after 9 patients.
- GSK and Merck vaccines (Liberia): Suspended after 500 volunteers received each vaccine.
- Merck vaccine (Guinea): Ring study: More than 4000 vaccinated, efficacy demonstrated. Frontline worker study: 2000 vaccinated.
- Merck vaccine (Sierra Leone): Frontline worker study, 8000+ vaccinated.]

[It would be interesting to know the reasons why some of the trials were stopped after as few as 4 were treated or as many as 500 were vaccinated. - Mod.JW]

30 Dec 2015 USA (RI): Rhode Island ceases Ebola monitoring
http://www.providencejournal.com/article/20151230/NEWS/151239906/13748/NEWS
[The US State of Rhode Island has ended its program of monitoring every person arriving from the 3 West African nations hardest hit by the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak. According to Daniela Quilliam of the Department of Health's Center for Acute Infectious Disease Epidemiology, the state monitored a total of 265 people for EVD.]

[I suppose it all boils down to perceived cost-benefit. - Mod.JW]

3 Jan 2016 UK: Ebola nurse hails hero doctor who TWICE saved her life after he is honored with a knighthood
http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/ebola-nurse-pauline-cafferkey-hails-7110383
[Dr Michael Jacobs, who treated her twice for Ebola virus disease (EVD) -- once in December 2014 and again in October 2015 when she suffered a relapse -- has been honored with a knighthood.

According to the nurse, "I feel his honor is very well deserved. Dr Jacobs went above and beyond what was required. He is a very humble man who always emphasized that everything was a team effort. For a 2nd time, staff at the hospital have worked incredibly hard to help me recover, and I will always be grateful to them and the NHS."]

30 Dec 2015: Ebola virus has evolved to fight resistance in bats
http://www.americanlaboratory.com/181620-Ebola-Virus-Has-Evolved-to-Fight-Resistance-in-Bats/
[Excerpt: Scientists at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, the University of Colorado-Boulder (CU-Boulder), and the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) discovered that bats have developed resistance to Ebola virus, and the virus, in turn, has evolved to combat that resistance.

Ebola virus infects host cells by attaching its surface glycoprotein to NPC1, a host cell receptor. According to study co-leader Kartik Chandran, PhD, associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the Harold and Muriel Block Faculty Scholar in Virology at Einstein, "Here, we show how bats have evolved to resist Ebola infection and how, in turn, the virus could have evolved to overcome that resistance..."]
