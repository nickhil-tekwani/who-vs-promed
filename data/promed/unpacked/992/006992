[Note that in the previous week (section [2]) there was a positive environmental sample (ES) for WPV1 in Pakistan, but this week a positive AFP case due to WPV1 was confirmed in Afghanistan, bringing the 2021 total to 5 WPV1 AFP cases. As stated previously, these cases serve as a reminder that in areas of civil unrest, "silent" transmission of the WPV1 may go undetected for prolonged periods.

With respect to cVDPV2, Nigeria continues to have multiple states involved with ongoing transmission and this week Cameroon reported a newly confirmed cVDPV2 AFP case. While there were no cases of cVDPV2 AFP confirmed last week, there were positive ESs in Central African Republic, Nigeria and Uganda confirming these countries had continued circulation of the virus.

A map showing the location of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan, cVDPV1 in Madagascar and Yemen, and WPV1 in Afghanistan and Pakistan. - Mod.MPP
