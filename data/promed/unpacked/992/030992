CORRIDOR DISEASE, CATTLE - SOUTH AFRICA (KWAZULU-NATAL)
=======================================================
The following is a press release by Veterinary Services, KwaZulu-
Natal Province, South Africa, dated 6 March 1997.
"An outbreak of Corridor Disease occured on a farm adjacent to the
Mfolozi Game Reserve. The disease was sparked off by the presence of
four buffalo which had apparently escaped from the Mfolozi/Hluhluwe
complex and which are the carriers of Corridor Disease. The clinical
signs and post mortem findings were typical for the disease and the
diagnosis has been confirmed on specimens submitted to the
Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute. A total of about 40 cattle have
died to date.
The disease, which is caused by _Theileria parva lawrencei_, is
transmitted directly from buffalo to cattle by the brown ear tick
(_Rhipicephalus appendiculatus_). This contact is essential for
transmission of the disease.
The farm has been placed under quarentine and every effort is being
made by the Natal Parks Board and the Veterinary Directorate to
locate and eliminate the carrier animals while an intensive dipping
programme has been implemented to ensure proper tick control in the
area.
The disease is isolated and farmers should not be concerned about the
disease causing problems elsewhere.
Quarantine of the farm will be lifted as soon as the disease has been
brought under control and the source of the infection has been
eliminated."

COMMENTS:
It must be kept in mind that the above press release is for the
popular press and is aimed at informing the farming community of the
situation.
The outbreak is at the southern edge of the corridor that the disease
is named after.
Some of the buffalo that are on the farm have been eliminated, with one
or two still to be found.
