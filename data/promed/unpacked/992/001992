Rodent-related diseases are making themselves known in 2011 in the
'Land of Enchantment' with cases of hantavirus and plague finding
their way into the human population.

The latest is the 2nd case of bubonic plague reported by the New
Mexico Department of Health on Fri 27 May 2011. The patient is a
78-year-old man from Santa Fe County [also where the 1st case of 2011
was from. - Mod.LL] who is recovering in the hospital.

New Mexico Health Secretary Dr Catherine Torres warns that health
officials are seeing plague activity in both humans and animals in
parts of north-central New Mexico and precautions need to be taken to
avoid rodents and their fleas.

[Most cases of _Yersinia pestis_ infection in the USA occur in the
"Four Corners" states of Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah and
no cases have ever been acquired along the east coast of the country.

In New Mexico, 262 cases have been reported from 1949 to 2010
(http://www.health.state.nm.us/erd/HealthData/documents/HumanPlagueinNMbyCounty1949-2010.pdf),
the cases are concentrated in the counties in the north western part
of the state as can be seen in the URL above. Santa Fe county, where
this case arose, reported the most cases, which may in part be related
to a higher population. - Mod.LL]

[The Four Corners region of the US (Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado,
and Utah) can be seen on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at
http://healthmap.org/r/00bF. Santa Fe County can be located on the
