The number of people hit by salmonella food poisoning at the
University of Western Ontario has jumped by another 8 confirmed
cases, the Middlesex-London Health Unit reported yesterday, 26 Nov
2007. With the latest laboratory tests, the total sickened now
officially stands at 85.

The jump in cases yesterday [26 Nov 2007] followed a quiet weekend in
which no new cases were reported. At least 5 students have been
hospitalized from the illness. Dozens more students have reported
symptoms consistent with salmonella food poisoning, but haven't been
tested. The health unit is no longer releasing statistics on those
cases, said associate medical officer of health Dr Bryna Warshawsky.

The outbreak has been linked to the Pita Pit fast-food outlet at the
university's community center, which was shut down and sanitized
before reopening. It will be later this week before the health unit
can determine if the cleanup eliminated the salmonella bacteria.

Warshawsky said she anticipates there will be more lab-confirmed
cases as the health unit encourages students who have been ill to
submit stool samples for testing.

An online survey of students who ate at the Pita Pit is being
conducted on the university's website by the health unit in an effort
to pinpoint the cause of the salmonella contamination. The survey
closes at 11:55 p.m. today [27 Nov 2007]. "We are getting a really
good response," said Warshawsky, with about equal numbers of people
who were sick and those who weren't.

[The strain has been identified as _Salmonella enterica_ serotype
Typhimurium, Phage Type 108, Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis pattern
STXAI.0312. The posting does not state whether the new cases are
newly reported or, probably less likely, newly occurring. The latter
would suggest, of course, the continued presence of an infectious
vehicle for spread.

The survey mentioned (<http://www.uwo.ca/its/doc/mlhu/>) is looking
for individuals with diarrhea (3 or more bowel movements in a 24-hour
period) at any time between 1-11 Nov 2007, which also suggests all
the new cases are just newly reported. ProMED awaits information
regarding the results of the ongoing food survey.

The location of this outbreak is in London, Ontario, which can be
seen in the southwestern part of the province on the map at
