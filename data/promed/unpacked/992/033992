Health officials said Sacramento County is experiencing an outbreak of pertussis, which causes a loud, gasping whooping cough. Sacramento County officials reported 69 confirmed cases in 2014. In 2013, about 59 cases were reported for the entire calendar year. 11 of the 69 are young children and many are teenagers, the health department said.

Sacramento County public health officer Dr Olivia Kasirye said it's not uncommon for parents not to know what their child is suffering from when it comes to whooping cough. "If you have enough people immunized, you can stop it from spreading," Kasirye said. "It's spread through the air, through droplets -- usually, you have to be in pretty close contact with the person."

Schools and daycares are susceptible. What may appear to be a slight cough at first can get much worse. "If it's a child, sometimes they go blue in the face," Kasirye said. "They might even start throwing up and they might have the characteristic whoop at the end of an episode (of) coughing." Kasirye said it can be especially challenging to spot in babies who may only appear to have the sniffles.

Cases of pertussis, a potentially deadly disease also known as whooping cough, are on the rise in Napa County in 2014, Napa County's top health official said. Napa County Public Health Officer Dr Karen Smith said 17 cases have been reported so far in 2013, 9 of them in the last 2 weeks. There were 13 pertussis cases in Napa County in all of 2013. All but 3 of this year's [2014], 17 reported cases have been in children of middle or high school age, Smith said.

Smith urged women in their 3rd trimester of pregnancy to get vaccinated for pertussis to provide protection of the infant through transfer of antibodies from the mother before birth and by preventing the mother from passing a pertussis infection to the young infant after birth. Family members and childcare providers who have contact with the infant also should be vaccinated, health officials said.

Pertussis is cyclical and peaks every 3 to 5 years, health officials said. The last epidemic in California was in 2010 when there were 9100 cases statewide and 10 infant deaths.

All of Napa County's neighboring counties also are experiencing a high rate of pertussis, public health officials said.

Contra Costa County has seen a jump in the amount of whooping cough cases in 2014, with 9 cases of the disease found in a single school. In fact, in Martinez, all but 2 of the schools have seen confirmed cases. Morello Park Elementary was the school with 9 cases, the highest number in the county so far.

There have been 49 cases of whooping cough or pertussis, across the county. The 9 at Morello Park account for almost 20 percent of the county total.

"So far we have had 4 babies hospitalized here in Contra Costa. Luckily, all are recovering," said the county's communicable disease programs chief Erika Jenssen. "But in 2010, when there was a big epidemic across California, 10 babies died throughout the state. And what we're really trying to do is protect the babies from pertussis."

[4] California (Placer County) infant fatality

An infant in Placer County has died of whooping cough, public health officials said Wed 7 May 2014. It was only the 2nd infant fatality from pertussis in 2014 in California -- the 1st being in Riverside County in Southern California. Public health officials do not disclose the identity of individuals who die of communicable diseases, but they did confirm that the infant was less than 6 months old, the most vulnerable age for succumbing to whooping cough.

"It is a terrible tragedy for both the family and our community when a baby dies," said Dr Robert Oldham, Placer County's public health officer. "We can help prevent tragedies like these by vaccinating all pregnant women, ideally when they are between 27 and 36 weeks along in their pregnancies," Oldham said.

So far 11 cases of whooping cough have been confirmed at Allderdice High School, Pittsburgh Public Schools spokeswoman Ebony Pugh said [Tue 13 May 2014]. Pugh said the 1st case was confirmed in April 2014.

After the 1st case was confirmed, a letter was sent home to the parents of anyone in a classroom or team with the student or anyone not vaccinated. Pugh said a letter went out to all parents after the 4th case was confirmed.

State health officials are asking health care providers to be on the watch for pertussis in Pickens County since there has been a spike in cases over the past few weeks. State health officials are asking health care providers to be on the watch for pertussis in Pickens County since there has been a spike in cases over the past few weeks.

At this time in 2013, there were 66 cases statewide. But of the 30 cases reported in the state so far in 2014, 13 have been in Pickens County, including 2 cases at West End Elementary and Forest Acres Elementary that were reported in March 2014, according to the state Department of Health and Environmental Control [DHEC].

There have been no cases in Greenville County and fewer than 4 cases each in Anderson and Spartanburg counties, DHEC reports. "So far this year [2014], we've received reports of more pertussis cases from Pickens County compared to any other county in the state," said Dr Riyadh Muhammad, a DHEC medical consultant and pediatrician. "Through all of 2013," she said, "there were 9 cases reported in Pickens County."

There were 24 231 cases of pertussis in 2013 nationwide, CDC reports. And DHEC reports 212 in South Carolina in 2013.

[Vaccination of the pregnant mother towards the end of gestation is probably the best individual way of protecting an, as yet, not fully vaccinated infant against the morbidity and mortality of pertussis.

Clearly, much of the severe morbidity and almost all of the mortality from _Bordetella pertussis_ infection occur in those younger than 6 months. As many as 63 per cent of infants younger than 6 months of age with pertussis require hospitalization. In this CDC report from infants with pertussis in 1997-2000, there were 11.8 per cent with pneumonia, 1.4 per cent with seizures, 0.2 per cent with encephalopathy, and 0.8 per cent died [56/7203]. This compared with parallel numbers of 28 per cent, 8.6 per cent, 0.7 per cent, 0.1 per cent, and less than 0.1 per cent in infants 6-11 months of age (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5104a1.htm).

Neonatal pertussis is observed to be especially severe with as much as a 3 percent risk of death. Symptoms can be substantially different with periods of apnea [breathing arrest] sometimes with hypoxia-induced [low oxygen] seizures usually the most common manifestation of infection. The cough is present, but so weak that it may be unrecognized. In these children with so-called malignant pertussis, leukocytosis, particularly with white blood cell (WBC) counts of 30 000 to 100 000 and severe pulmonary hypertension are ominous signs for mortality. In a study comparing neonatal pertussis to other neonatal respiratory infections, pertussis-positive neonates had longer hospital stays, less fever, more apnea and cyanosis spells, and required more days of supplemental oxygen in the hospital and represented all the infants discharged on respiratory supportive care. - Mod.LL]
