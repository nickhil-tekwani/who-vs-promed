Raul Ortiz Soriano, the director of MIDA's [Ministry of Agricultural
Development] Coffee Program, said that during this season [2008/2009] a
total of 14.35 quintals [861 kg] was produced per hectare, compared with
the 13.25 [795 kg] per hectare harvested during the previous season
[2007/2008]. But during this 2008-2009 season the total production was
slightly inferior [it is expected that this year's harvest could reach a
total of 236 000 quintals (14 160 tonnes) of coffee] to the 2007-2008
season, during which time a total of 255 000 quintals [15 300 tonnes] were
harvested. The lower levels of production were caused by some plants being
infected with a disease called Ojo de Gallo, as well as the flooding that
occurred in some of the production areas of the Chiriqui province, said Ortiz.

[Ojo de gallo ("rooster's eye", American coffee leaf spot disease) is
caused by the fungus _Mycena citricolor_. It is found in subtropical and
tropical America and affects at least 150 known host species including both
arabica and robusta coffee species. The fungus is naturally present in
virgin forests from where it is thought to have spread to coffee. Ojo de
gallo is a major disease in higher altitude coffee plantations in Latin
America with up to 75 per cent yield loss reported.

Symptoms on coffee include brown spots with a yellow halo on leaves and
berries causing them to drop off prematurely. Defoliated trees eventually
die. Disease development is favoured by cool, moist conditions. The
pathogen is spread by splashing rain, with infected materials or by
mechanical means. Once established eradication is usually impossible
because of its wide host range.

Disease management is costly and mainly relies on fungicides. Cultural
methods, such as shade control, are sometimes used to reduce losses. No
real resistance to ojo de gallo has been found in coffee, although some
cultivars appear to be more susceptible than others. Research on biocontrol
using bacterial strains is in progress. This pathogen is a serious
quarantine risk for coffee growing areas in other parts of the world, but
it is of special scientific interest as a bioluminescent fungus.

The quintal bag of 60 kilograms is the standard weight unit of world coffee
production.
