Doctors fear bird flu outbreak
------------------------------
Banteay Meanchey provincial authorities fear an outbreak of avian
influenza (H5N1) after a mother and her child died 2 weeks ago and 7
more were hospitalised. Samples taken from the 21-year-old mother,
who died on 13 Feb 2011, and her 11-month-old son, who died on 15 Feb
2011, [have been] sent to the World Health Organization for testing
and results are expected soon.

"I am waiting for laboratory results to clarify the cause and hope to
know by the end of the day [22 Feb 2011]," Dr Nima Asgari, public
health specialist at the WHO, said today.

Keo Sopheaktra, director of Banteay Meanchey province's health
department, said the mother and son became sick after eating infected
chicken. "They both had a fever, cough and difficulty breathing
before they passed away."

He said 7 villagers who helped clean the mother's body for cremation
have been admitted to the Mongkol Borei district hospital for
treatment after each developed a fever and cough. Director of the
Mongkol Borei district hospital Ho Serey Vitthyu said the 7 are
recovering well.

[Since 2003 to 18 Feb 2011, the number of human cases of avian
A/(H5N1) influenza virus infection reported from 15 countries
worldwide is 520, of whom 307 were fatal (CFR 59.0 percent). Among
the countries with more than 10 reported cases, Indonesia had the
highest CFR of 82.5 percent (141 out of 171). Age distribution of the
reported cases ranged from 3 months to 81 years old (median 19 years,
n=499. The age group most affected was 0-9 years of age (29.1
percent, 145/499), relative to other age groups (10-19; 20-29; 30-39;
40-49; 50-59; 60-69; 70+ years). The highest CFR (73.4 percent) was
among persons 10-19 years of age and lowest (25.0 percent) was among
persons aged 70 and above. F53 percent of the cases were female
(263/495). Exposure to diseased poultry has been a common theme
(<http://www.wpro.who.int/NR/rdonlyres/806DD8BD-2820-41E5-818C-4156702C6573/0/AIWeekly269WPRO18Feb2011.pdf>).

So far in 2011 one confirmed fatal case of avian A/(H5N1) virus
infection has Benni confirmed in Cambodia, bringing the overall total
number of cases to 11 with 9 fatalities. If the 2 new suspected cases
described in the above press report are confirmed the total for
Cambodia will become 13 cases and 11 fatalities, giving a very high CFR.
