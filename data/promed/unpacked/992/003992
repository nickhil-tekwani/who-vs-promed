Evicting an Unwelcome Tenant: Anthrax
---------------------------------------------------
Government officials and scientists have feverishly sifted research on
disinfectants and technologies powerful enough to kill the anthrax spores,
which - like invisible biological land mines -- can sit dormant a century
or more and then still transform into live, toxin-producing bacteria. Many
of the methods that have been chosen or are being considered have other
established uses, but this is all new, largely untested terrain,
microbiologists and experts in sterilization technologies say.
Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency set up a mock office -- with
chairs, artwork, papers and photographs - in an airtight trailer near
Washington's contaminated Brentwood postal sorting building. Scientists
pumped in chlorine dioxide, a yellow-green, bacteria-killing gas proposed
for use in the partially contaminated Hart Senate Office Building. They
checked the effect on the materials. Some photographs were discolored, but
everything else came through fine. Everything, that is, except the spores
of a harmless bacterial cousin of the anthrax bacterium that laced paper
strips taped around the room. The spores all died, E.P.A. officials said.
Private companies and government laboratories have offered a host of gases,
foams, and truck-size particle-accelerating machines that disrupt DNA with
high-speed electrons. Many are well-established means of killing bacteria
in laboratory "clean rooms," hospital goods, foods, or on assembly lines
for products like finger bandages and the small creamer cups on deli counters.
But most have been tested only on surrogates for anthrax bacteria and have
been hastily reconceived as weapons in the anthrax war. Therefore, federal
officials and bioterrorism experts say, some surprises and setbacks are
likely. Certainly, experts in dangerous germs said, no one should expect
perfect results with these early efforts. One challenge, some officials
say, is there is no way to check every crevice of a tainted building for
residual spores and, even if a few are found, they may not pose a health
risk significant enough to justify further cleaning. Moreover, there is no
established standard yet for determining when a treated building or batch
of mail is safe. Also, depending on the sterilization method, some of the
DNA and antibody tests that are used to check for spores may not be able to
discriminate between a live one and a dead one. This could produce false
positives that might alarm workers being asked to reoccupy a once-tainted
building. The only way to be sure would be to use the lengthier, costlier
method of culturing individual samples in the laboratory to see if spores
germinated into bacteria.
Chlorine dioxide gas, the method chosen for the Senate offices, kills the
bacteria working from the outside in. The gas causes an oxidizing reaction
that eats holes in a spore's outer shell, disrupting its metabolism and
preventing it from transforming into a rod-shaped bacterium that can then
begin to reproduce. Some scientists question whether some spores in the
middle of a dense clump might survive such an attack. But the technique has
big advantages over liquids or foams, particularly in a large, complex
structure, because the gas can be easily disseminated through a ventilation
system and then permeate every nook and crevice.
The other new disinfectant getting its first big field test is a
disinfecting foam that was developed at the Sandia National Laboratories in
New Mexico to destroy biological and chemical weapons. The foam, which
causes an oxidizing reaction similar to that from chlorine dioxide, has
been used to clean several Congressional offices and at ABC News, where the
child of a producer contracted an anthrax skin infection.

In Lansing, Mich., the nation's only manufacturer of an anthrax vaccine
said it expects it will be at least mid-December before it can win federal
permission to ship it. BioPort Corp. has been unable to distribute the
vaccine since it failed FDA inspections in 1999 and 2000. The company
submitted new documents for the FDA's approval last month.
BioPort will start a new production cycle on 22 Nov, spokeswoman Kim
Brennan Root said. Inspectors from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
will visit in mid-December, she said.
