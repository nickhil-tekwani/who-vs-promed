Fresh cases of avian influenza or bird flu have been detected in
another Tripura poultry farm, and culling of birds is expected to
start Monday [7 Mar 2011], an official said here Sunday.

"At least 400 poultry birds have died since 1 Mar 2011 at the Gandhi
Gram government poultry farm. Central government experts tested the
samples of the dead birds and found them positive for the H5 strain of
avian influenza," Tripura animal resource development department Joint
Director Jyotirmoy Chakraborty told IANS.

He said: "For further confirmation, the samples have been sent to the
Eastern Region Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (ERDDL) in Kolkata and
the High Security Animal Disease Laboratory (HSADL) in Bhopal. Reports
from both the laboratories are expected by late Sunday [6 Mar 2011]."

According to officials, if the 2 reports are confirmed positive for
the H5 strain of avian influenza, the culling of birds would start
from Monday [7 Mar 2011] at the government poultry farm, where more
than 7000 poultry birds are lodged.

The Gandhi poultry farm, 30 km north of Agartala in western Tripura,
is situated between several villages.

The authorities, after culling more than 6000 ducks and poultry birds
in western Tripura last month [February 2011], had sounded a bird flu
alert and had intensified surveillance across the bordering state.

With the disease's outbreak at the Radha Kishore Nagar government
farm, 25 km north of Agartala, the government has taken measures to
check its spread in other areas.

"After culling operations, the mopping, cleaning, disinfection
processes have also been completed at the government-run farm and
adjoining 3-4 villages. Now our officials have been maintaining
special observations in these areas and other parts of the state,"
Chakraborty said.

The government has also imposed a ban on import of poultry birds,
ducks and other poultry products from outside the state.

A central team from the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI)
in Uttar Pradesh and another from the North Eastern Region Disease
Diagnostic Laboratory (NERDDL) in Assam have visited Tripura and
provided necessary assistance to the state officials.

Tripura, bordering Bangladesh, was affected by avian influenza in
April and May 2008, forcing the authorities to cull over 200 000
poultry birds then.

Around 2000 chickens have been culled in Gazipur and Noakhali
following the detection of H5N1 virus, commonly known as bird flu.

Gazipur Sadar Upazila livestock officer Mohammad Shamsur Rahman on
Saturday [5 Mar 2011] told bdnews24.com that the bird flu infection
was confirmed by the Central Diseases Investigation Laboratory in
Dhaka.

Some 1137 chickens were executed around 10 pm on Friday [4 Mar 2011],
when 205 eggs were also destroyed. Apart from this, in the last 2
days, over 13 000 chickens were executed in the district.

The official said the district livestock department on Friday [4 Mar
2011] sent sample tissue of a dead chicken to the laboratory for tests
after some of the chickens of Bushra Poultry Farm in Taratpara area
died on Thursday.

A direction was immediately passed to the Upazila livestock
department to cull the infected chickens in a bid to stop the
infection's spread in the surrounding areas.

In Noakhali, about 600 chickens out of over 6500 of a poultry farm
named Shikha Agro Complex of Manikpur village under Sirajpur union
died over the last few days.

The local livestock department directed the farm owner to bury the
dead chickens, and it banned shifting the chickens and eggs of the
farm to another place.

Upazila livestock officer Abul Kalam told bdnews24.com that they had
confirmed the infection following the analysis of the tissue at the
district laboratory and the regional diseases investigation laboratory
in Feni.

"We are waiting for directives from higher authorities to cull the
infected chickens," he added.
