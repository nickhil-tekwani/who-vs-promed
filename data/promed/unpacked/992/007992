[This report also has information about monkeypox cases in the Central African Republic and in Nigeria that has already been posted by ProMED-mail (see archives below). The Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo reports are new. - Mod.TY]

Republic of Congo:
The Republic of Congo is reporting cases of monkey pox since February 2019; 2 samples from Makontipoko village in Gambona district tested in the INRB-Kinshasa turned positive for monkeypox (PCR OPX). There are 9 total cases reported with no fatalities.

Democratic Republic of the Congo:
In the week ending 3 Mar 2019, 90 new suspected cases including 2 deaths were reported. The cases of monkeypox have been confirmed in the Provincial Health Divisions of Equateur, North Ubangi and South Ubangi. A total of 824 cases have been reported, including 12 deaths.

[ProMED-mail has been reporting sporadic cases of monkeypox (MPX) in Africa, which are not new to DR Congo or the Republic of the Congo, so the appearance of these cases in 2019 is not surprising.

Prevention of MPX virus infections will not be possible without knowing the source of infection. The question remains about the source of these recent infections. Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Studies of prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or in previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp., an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected.

The MPX virus clade involved in these and previous ones is not mentioned. As noted in previous ProMED-mail posts, the monkeypox virus clade in the Congo Basin causes more severe disease in humans -- with a case fatality rate of 11-17 percent -- than the clade in Ghana, which causes few fatalities. - Mod.TY
