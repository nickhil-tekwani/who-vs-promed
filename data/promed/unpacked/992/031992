Yuan, Taipei, Chinese Taipei.

Date submitted to OIE: 05 Nov 2009
Reason for notification: emerging disease
Morbidity: 4.8 per cent
Mortality: 0 per cent
Zoonotic impact: no
Causal agent: A/H1N1 influenza virus
Serotype: not typed
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks
Outbreak 1: Guanshan township, T'ai-Tung
Date of start of the outbreak: 19 Oct 2009
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Swine / 3346 / 160 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: 5 week old piglets

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak statistics
Species: swine
Apparent morbidity rate: 4.78 per cent
Apparent mortality rate: 0.00 per cent
Apparent case fatality rate: 0.00 per cent
Proportion susceptible animals lost*: 0.00 per cent
* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction,
and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: A/H1N1 influenza virus surveillance programme
began since January 2009 in the country. Clinical signs such as coughing
and diarrhoea were observed in a pig farm located in T'ai-Tung County on 19
Oct 2009. The owner reported it to the prefecture animal disease control
competent authority. Official veterinarian inspected this farm right away.
Samples were collected and sent to the Animal Health Research Institute.

Disinfection and cleaning of the index farm has been conducted and
completed. Movement control has been also implemented. The positive results
of virus isolation, real-time RT-PCR and gene sequencing demonstrated that
this outbreak was caused by H1N1 influenza A virus.

The sick pigs in the index farm have recovered. One pig farm within 1 km
radius of the index farm has been under vigilant monitoring and no clinical
or epidemiological evidence of infection has been found. 7 pig farms within
3 km radius of the index farm have also been under intensive monitoring.

Control measures
Measures applied:
- movement control inside the country;
- disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s);
- vaccination prohibited [see comment];
- no treatment of affected animals.

Measures to be applied:
- no other measures

[Chinese Taipei (OIE's nomenclature for Taiwan) indicates, for the control
measure "vaccination," the status "prohibited". Following a previous remark
from a subscriber (see item 2 in 20091028.3737), we have tried to clarify
the issue with OIE's information department.

In relation to vaccination of animals, the WAHIS electronic notification
system allows the reporting country to use one of the following 3 optional
modes:
1. "Vaccination in response to the outbreak(s)"
2. "Vaccination prohibited"
3. "Vaccination not prohibited"

Evolution of pandemic H1N1 2009 in animals
------------------------------------------
The OIE is closely monitoring the world animal health situation including
with regard to infections of all susceptible animals with the pandemic H1N1
2009 virus.

Regular reports of countries notifying the presence of the pandemic H1N1
2009 influenza virus in animals to the OIE show disease surveillance in
animals and reporting mechanisms function well and, that the very vast
majority of OIE Member Countries act in full transparency with the
international community.

"Pandemic H1N1 2009 virus infections in pigs and other susceptible animals
were assessed as probable from the very 1st days after the virus was
detected in humans. So, it does not come as a surprise that notifications
of infection in new animals species are received; on the contrary it
demonstrates animal disease surveillance is efficient and functioning to
the benefit of all," Dr Bernard Vallat, OIE director general commented.

So far, no evidence has suggested that animals play any particular role in
the epidemiology or the spread of the pandemic H1N1 2009 virus among
humans. Instead, investigations led by competent national authorities point
to possible human-to-animal transmission in most cases. For this reason,
the OIE considers that it is sufficient to certify the healthy state of
animals for international trade during the relevant period before their
exportation and maintains its position that no specific measures, including
laboratory tests, are required for international trade in live pigs and
other susceptible animal species and/or their products.

Laboratories in the OFFLU network (OIE-FAO joint network of expertise on
animal influenza) across the world have been sharing biological material
and information, and have been working to assess transmission and
pathogenesis of the pandemic H1N1 2009 virus in different species of
animals. The experiments demonstrated among other things at an early stage
that pigs are susceptible to the pandemic H1N1 2009 virus but that infected
pigs only showed mild signs of disease.

Nevertheless, the OIE continues to encourage the surveillance and reporting
of the presence of all epidemiologic events of significance in animals due
to influenza viruses, as well as any other emerging pathogen. "As national
Veterinary Authorities continue and intensify surveillance for the pandemic
H1N1 2009 virus in susceptible animals, it is very likely that there will
be additional findings of other influenza strains," Dr Vallat commented.
"That is why we insist on the importance of epidemiological investigations
of unusual illness among all animals, and the necessary collaboration and
communication between animal health and public health authorities," he added.

All recommendations on the pandemic H1N1 2009 virus issued so far by the
OIE to national Veterinary Services remain valid. The OIE strongly
encourages the effective implementation of international standards and
notification obligations by all and offers its assistance to any Member
Country wishing to comply with these standards.
