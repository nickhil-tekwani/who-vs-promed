An unusually early flashflood [that] struck the northeastern regions of Bangladesh, has come as a blow to Boro, the biggest of the country's 3 rice seasons. Reports also came in from some other parts of the country.

Prof M Bahadur Meah, Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU), [said] that crops were getting sterile due to neck blast attacks. "We sent out messages to farmers to spray anti-blast fungicides," he said. He feared a substantial crop loss this year [2017] [and] recommended that the government provides farmers with subsidised fungicides.

A consultative workshop [will be held] involving all relevant departments and representatives from the international community. The government wants to expand high yielding and African drought-tolerant varieties by distributing seed and fertilizer and subsidising irrigation [to] help recoup, to some extent, the loss of Boro.

[Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Pyricularia oryzae_ (synonym _Magnaporthe oryzae_). It is one of the most destructive diseases of the crop worldwide, with potential yield losses of more than 50 per cent. Symptoms include lesions on all parts of the shoot, as well as stem rot and panicle blight. When nodes are infected, all plant parts above the infection die and yield losses are severe. When infection occurs at the seedling or tillering stages, plants are often completely killed. Depending on which plant parts are affected, the disease may manifest itself as leaf, collar, node, or neck blast. More than 50 species of grasses and sedges can be affected by related pathogens, but most strains isolated from rice can only infect a limited number of cultivars.

The fungus also causes wheat blast (for example, see ProMED-mail posts 20170306.4883233 & 20170123.4784298). Although the pathogens are currently classified as the same species, the wheat blast pathogen is a distinct population (referred to as _P. oryzae_ Triticum population) and does not cause disease in rice.

Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by climatic conditions. The disease is also favoured by high nitrogen levels (for example from fertilizers) and high humidity. The fungus is spread by infected plant debris, mechanical means (including insect activity), water and wind. Disease management may include fungicides and cultural practices but relies mainly on resistant varieties. However, the fungus is highly variable and this favours the emergence of new strains with increased virulence.

In Bangladesh, a recent report of an undiagnosed fungus in Rangpur division (ProMED-mail post 20170424.4989750) may also refer to rice blast.
