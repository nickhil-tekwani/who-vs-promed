Angry farmers from Fukushima brought a large cow to the center of Tokyo on Friday [20 Jun 2014] to demand that the government investigate a disease they say cattle have developed since the nuclear disaster started 3 years ago.

Operators of the non-profit Kibo no Bokujo (Farm of Hope) delivered an adult black cow to the front of the farm ministry to demand an investigation into why it and many other animals have developed white dots on their skin since 3 reactors at the poorly protected Fukushima No. 1 plant went into meltdown after the earthquake and tsunami of March 2011.

The farm is 14 km (9 miles) from the power plant and is keeping some 350 cows that were abandoned when their owners fled the radiation.

"Our cows cannot be shipped as meat. They are evidence of lives affected by radiation," said Masami Yoshizawa, leader of the farm, in front of the ministry as his supporters and media looked on.

Fellow Fukushima farmer Naoto Matsumura said: "What if this started happening to people? We have to examine the cause of this and let people know what happened to these animals."

Vast stretches of farmland in Fukushima have been tainted by radioactive fallout from the plant, forcing tens of thousands of residents to abandon their homes and jobs for life in temporary shelters.

The government says it could take decades to clean the region, but scientists say many residents may never be able to return.

[An explanation of the observed dermal changes (a picture of which is available at the source URL), if/when becoming available, will be appreciated. Is it just an aesthetic issue or rather a visible illustration indicating a systemic affection of the animals? Does it have public health implications? - Mod.AS]

[FARAD's (the USA Food Animal Residue Avoidance Databank) report noted that milk is a significant source of human exposure in post-crisis contamination areas. Strontium and cesium are the primary concerns for milk contamination. Strontium's biological half-life in milk is from 10 to 40 hours while cesium has a reported half-life up to 9 days. Transfer coefficients (the equilibrium ratio between radionuclide activity concentration in milk or meat and the daily intake of radionuclide) are used to predict contamination of animal products following the release of radionuclides into the environment. This is complex, for as in the case of strontium, dietary calcium alters this ratio. Soil type has a major effect on these values, with transfer from soil to plants favored in peat versus clay soils. After exposure, radioisotope uptake into plant roots determines how long fields, and thus feedstuffs, stay contaminated.

Radiation in continued doses, since the animals are eating from tainted soil, may indeed bleach hair, produce tumors and non or poorly functioning thyroid in animals (as well as people).

The articles provides little information aside from the producers knowing their animals are ill and having white hair. I suspect there are internal cancers as well. Perhaps an induction of Bovine leukosis. - Mod.TG
