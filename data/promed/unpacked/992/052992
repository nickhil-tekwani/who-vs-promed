INFECTION CONTROL - VIRGINIA, USA
=================================
Date: Mon, 10 Jun 1996 10:16:46 +0500
From: pnh0trz@pnh10.med.navy.mil (CAPT Thaddeus R. Zajdowicz)

This is Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth, VA. We are interested to hear the
comments coming forth on IC in the ProMED-mail postings.
I am on the Infection Control Committee for a 300+ bed Navy hospital - we
hope to have our ICPs on-line very soon. The primary problems here have
been MRSA and VRE, but not in overwhelming numbers. We have seen
penicillin-resistant pneumococcus from the community as well -- although
again not many. I pass info from ProMED-mail along to the other people involved
in IC here.
