Thank you very much [for asking "mignet" friends to let ProMED-mail
subscribers know more about the outbreak of viral fever and jaundice in
Kushtia.
I am not a reader of the "Daily Star" and thus did not see the news before.
Unfortunately today (Friday) is the first day of the weekend holidays here.
The office will resume on next Sunday. I tried to contact Director of
Primary Health Care (Bangladesh), the "Daily Star" (news source), Prof. of
Hepatology Department and Prof. of Virology Department at Bangobandhu
Medical University, Dhaka. I could contact only the former two.
The Director, PHC informed me that he was not [told by the Civil Surgeon
(District Health Administrator) about the outbreak. However, he will try to
contact the Civil Surgeon and will investigate the matter.
The "Daily Star" advised me to talk directly to the concerned
correspondent. I called Kushtia and talked to the reporter. He informed me
that the outbreak of viral fever was in large number compared to jaundice.
The attack rates of both epidemics are coming down, although that of viral
fever is still in high number. The cause of viral fever may be
investigated. About the jaundice, he has informed me that perhaps it is due
to intake of contaminated food, water, and bad hygienic conditions. I
assume it may be due to Hepatitis A virus.
