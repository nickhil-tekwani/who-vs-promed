[It is now 21 days since the last report of a locally transmitted case in Wuhan -- 7 days more than 1 incubation period (an outbreak is usually declared over/transmission declared interrupted after 2 incubation periods without newly confirmed cases). In today's (24 Apr 2020) report, there was 1 new report of a locally transmitted infection in Heilongjiang. and 11 newly confirmed imported cases bringing the total of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours to 12. It has now been 31 days since restrictions were lifted in Guangdong and Heilongjiang, and it appears as though local transmission has been established in both Heilongjiang and Guangdong over the past 20 days or so, albeit the number of reported cases from Guangdong is decreasing, with no newly confirmed cases reported today.

According to the report above, a total of 82 816 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4632 deaths, representing an increase of 12 cases mentioned above, in the 24 hours since yesterday's (23 Apr 2020) report, and there were no newly reported deaths. In Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases had been reported daily, none were reported today. And Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases.

As best as I can decipher from the machine-translated report above, there were 29 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, 4 were in imported cases. There was one conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 983, and 150 of these are importations from abroad. It would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly. It is apparent that there is most likely thorough contact tracing and testing to explain the daily reports of asymptomatic infections in addition to the screening of individuals arriving from overseas.

As reported, on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world is watching carefully to see whether this is safe timing. There do appear to be chains of transmission ongoing in Guangdong (perhaps approaching interruption) and Heilongjiang that are of concern, but clearly the most concerning are the imported cases returning to China.

From the English language outbreak report page of 24 Apr 2020 https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030
KCDC released interim analysis of epidemiological investigation on cases linked to Uijeongbu St Mary's Hospital in Gyeonggi Province.
- From [30 Mar 2020] to [21 Apr 2020], 57 cases within the hospital (patients = 26; nurses = 3; physicians = 2; janitors = 2; caregivers = 10; family/guardians = 14) and 15 cases from local transmission to communities (family = 6; Hantan River Spa Hotel = 7; Asan Medical Center = 2) were confirmed.
- According to the epidemiological investigation, there was a patient who started showing symptoms before symptom onset (26 Mar 2020) of the index case of this cluster. Also, one person who had been discharged from inpatient care at this hospital was confirmed on [20 Mar 2020]. Therefore, it is presumed that transmission occurred in the hospital before [20 Mar 2020]. The infection source has not been identified.
- Some confirmed cases are not from the 8th floor where the index case was receiving inpatient care. Therefore, it is presumed that transmission between different floors occurred by the movement of healthcare workers, caregivers, and/or patients.
- Once the cluster outbreak was identified, central and local governments worked together for response. 58 additional cases were found through their efforts at tracking discharged patients, family/guardians, and caregivers no longer working at the hospital and contact monitoring.
- By testing all contacts, 22 (30.6%) asymptomatic infected persons were identified early. No secondary transmission from asymptomatic case occurred.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 192 994 cases, including 25 969 deaths, up from 189 973 cases and 25 549 deaths reported on 23 Apr 2020. The 24-hour change between 23 and 24 Apr 2020 was 3021 newly confirmed cases, compared with 2646 newly confirmed cases between 22 Apr 2020 and 23 Apr 2020 -- a slow vacillating but steady decline. Numbers of hospitalized cases and numbers of cases in the ICU are also experiencing a decline. Cases continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 78.4% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the main contributor representing 36.1% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Liguria is the only other province reporting more than 100 cases in the past 24 hours (4.1% of newly reported cases). 5 provinces reported less than 10 newly confirmed cases and another 7 provinces reported less than 50 newly confirmed cases. All signs of decreasing local transmission. There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 38 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 36 days since the countrywide lockdown. The lockdown is being extended until 3 May 2020 (see ProMED-mail post 20200411.7211958 for details).

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 925 038 including 52 185 deaths, an increase from 880 204 cases and 49 845 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York state, with 277 445 (30.0%) cumulative case reports and 8864 (19.8%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing. New York City had a cumulative total of 146 139 as of 2:30 PM on 24 Apr 2020, including 10 746 confirmed deaths and an additional 5102 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

Daily reported case counts are high in Massachusetts (4946 -- 11.0% of total), Pennsylvania (3096 -- 6.9%), Illinois (2724 -- 6.1%), New Jersey (2171 -- 4.8%), and California (1524 --3.4%). In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, Massachusetts, California, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Michigan, Florida, Louisiana, and Connecticut.

The US Military has confirmed 6213 cumulative cases, with 312 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. The Veteran Affairs just reported today at 6528 cases. There have been 977 cases reported from federal prisons (unchanged in the past 24 hours) and 1360 cases reported from the Navajo Nation (an increase of 39 in the past 24 hours). Puerto Rico has reported 1276 cases (a decrease of 140 cases in the past 24 hours). I was unable to open the Puerto Rico Health Department website http://salud.gov.pr/ to validate the numbers and the CDC had figures from 23 Apr 2020.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html has a growth curve and a table giving demographics (age and ethnicity) where known.

[Spain is 2nd globally in terms of the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. There were 6740 newly confirmed cases reported today (24 Apr 2020) and 4635 cases reported yesterday (23 Apr 2020). While the daily newly confirmed cases have continued in the 4000-5000 range until today, the 14-day population-based rate is gradually decreasing as is the daily number of deaths.

As of today (24 Apr 2020), totals of 219 764 cases and 22 524 deaths have been reported, up from 213 024 cases and 22 157 deaths in the preceding 24 hours (23 Apr 2020). The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is now 97.75, a continual slow decrease over the past 14 days from a high of 214.43 on 7 Apr 2020 to 97.75 today (24 Apr 2020). Spain has the highest case count in Europe and is 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 219 764 cases, approximately 78 545 (35.7% have been hospitalized and 7771 (3.5%) admitted to the ICU (there is a note mentioning that some of the communities are providing daily prevalence data, hence my use of "approximately" for hospitalization and ICU data).

A map of Spain showing provinces (autonomous communities) can be seen at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/spain-administrative-map.htm and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7265865,43. La Rioja, Madrid, and Castile and Leon are the most affected communities by population-based rates. La Rioja and Castile and Leon are located together in the northern part of the country. Madrid is located in central Spain, with Castile and Leon to its northwest and La Rioja to its northeast. - Mod.MPP]

A New York Times analysis suggests that Ecuador's death toll is 15 times higher than its official tally of coronavirus deaths, highlighting the damage the virus can do in developing countries.

But the epidemic is even worse than many people in the country realize. The death toll in Ecuador during the outbreak was 15 times higher than the official number of COVID-19 deaths reported by the government, according to an analysis of mortality data by The New York Times. The numbers suggest that the South American country is suffering one of the worst outbreaks in the world.

The figures provide a dire indication of the damage the virus can do to developing countries, where it can quickly overwhelm healthcare systems and even the government's ability to keep count of how many people are falling to the disease.

A staggering number of people -- about 7600 more this year [2020] -- died in Ecuador from [1 Mar 2020] to [15 Apr 2020] than the average in recent years, according to an analysis of official death registration data by The Times. That spike stands in stark contrast to the number of deaths that the government has officially attributed to the coronavirus: 503 people by [15 Apr 2020].

Mortality data in the middle of a pandemic is inexact, and it could change. The additional deaths include those from COVID-19, as well as from other causes, including people who could not be treated at hospitals inundated with coronavirus patients. But the data points to an enormous, and sudden, increase in deaths. 3 times the usual number of people died in Ecuador during the 1st 2 weeks of April [2020], when the number of people falling ill reached a peak -- an extraordinary rise that exceeds increases seen in similar data from Spain and the United Kingdom.

Ecuador's beleaguered government, which is also dealing with its worst economic crisis in decades, acknowledged early in the outbreak that its official mortality figures fell far short of reality. "We know that both the number of infections and the number of deaths are falling short," Ecuador's president, Lenin Moreno, said in a public address on [2 Apr 2020]. "The reality always overtakes the number of tests and the speed of attention" of medical services, he said.

There has been a surge of infections in the province that includes Ecuador's business capital, Guayaquil, where residents are thought to have brought the virus home after visiting Spain. In Guayaquil, fatalities during the 1st 2 weeks of April [2020] were 8 times higher than usual, the data indicates -- a far greater rise than that of New York City, where fatalities were 4 times higher in recent weeks. Within weeks of the 1st case being identified in Guayaquil, hospitals were overflowing and burial systems collapsed under overwhelming demand.

While the images shocked Latin America and the world, the true scale of the crisis has largely been obscured by the government's limited ability to determine who has the virus, a situation exacerbated by global shortages of tests and other materials, said Cynthia Viteri, Guayaquil's mayor. "We will never know what the real number is because there are no tests," Ms Viteri said.

In early April [2020], the government created a task force to deal with the precipitous climb in the number of dead bodies that needed attention in Guayaquil. At the peak of the crisis, the team collected and authorized the burial of 5 times as many bodies than would normally be buried in the city on any given day. The wave of deaths is all the more disturbing for being impossible to explain. There is no obvious reason for Ecuador to be devastated far more than other countries. Its population is relatively young, and most people live in rural areas, both factors that should reduce the risk, said Jenny Garcia, a demographer who studies Latin America at the Institut National d'Etudes Demographiques in France.

That mystery is reflected in the pandemic's uneven consequences around the world, raising questions no one has been able to answer. Are some places just lucky? Do unknown local factors lead to dramatic differences?

Medical workers in Guayaquil and local residents who have lost their loved ones described the despair that washed over the city during the peak of the epidemic in early April [2020]. The virus spread through the usually bustling port city of 3 million with bewildering speed, hitting the plush suburban gated community of Samborondon and the working-class district of Febres Cordero particularly hard.

"I fall asleep with anxiety, not because I fear infection -- I actually don't think about it -- but because of the overload," said Dr Castillo, who works in an intensive care unit in Samborondon.

A national lockdown ordered by the government in mid-March [2020] appears to be bearing fruit, as official infection rates have stabilized. Deaths also fell sharply in Guayaquil last week [week of 13 Apr 2020]. Official figures show 128 died on [15 Apr 2020] in Guayas, the province that includes Guayaquil. That's down from 614 on [1 Apr 2020].

Despite the respite, Mr Moreno, the president, said the country is facing one of the toughest moments in its 200-year history, as the economic cost of the pandemic has been compounded by the collapse of export revenues, ruptures in the country's main oil pipelines, and massive foreign debt payments. He is now facing a tough choice between keeping a paralyzed economy shuttered longer, or risking a resurgence of the virus.

Under pressure from business groups, Mr Moreno said this week he's considering relaxing the lockdown and allowing some industries to go back to work. The news was greeted with anxiety in Guayaquil, where many residents are torn between a desire to return to work and fear of reliving the chaos of the past weeks. "The pandemic is not over," said Gina Mendoza, a Guayaquil nurse who has recently recovered from coronavirus. "We are scared of what could happen."

[In the past 24 hours, more testing has become available in Ecuador and the total number of reported confirmed cases doubled from 11 183 to 22 719 (see section [1] in today's global update: COVID-19 update (128): global, countries not reporting infections, WHO 20200425.7265864). The story in Ecuador is reminiscent of the story at the beginning of recognition of the pandemic entry into Iran back on 19 Feb 2020; and not far off from the rapid escalation seen in Italy and New York (USA), with an overwhelming of the healthcare services by the volume of severe cases requiring hospitalization and ICU care. When the healthcare surge capacity is no longer able to cope with the volume of cases, excess mortality occurs. These stories are painful to read as a healthcare professional.
