On [Fri 7 July 2017], one premise in Pinellas County, Florida was placed under quarantine for clinical signs and positive PCR confirmation of strangles, according to an Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) alert [Fri 7 July 2017].

The index case became clinical in [Fri 30 Jun 2017]. One of the 5 horses on the property was clinical at time of quarantine. This is the 1st case for Pinellas County and case 25 for Florida in 2017.

The highly contagious upper respiratory disease of equids, known as Strangles, is caused by the gram-positive Î²-hemolytic bacterium _Streptococcus equi_ ssp. _equi_.

The organism, _Streptococcus equi_ ssp._ equi_, can be transmitted via direct contact with nasal or ocular secretions or lymph node discharge from infected horses or via indirect exposure to contaminated trailers, stalls, riding equipment, buckets, halters, lead ropes, brushes, clothing, etc.

The incubation period typically ranges between 2 and 6 days but may last up to 14 days.

Classic signs may include fever (103 degrees F or higher), mucopurulent nasal discharge, lymphadenopathy (+/- abscessation), general malaise, pharyngitis, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), upper airway stridor (noisy breathing occurring due to obstructed air flow through a narrowed airway) and respiratory distress.

Clinical signs are often age-related, with older horses exhibiting milder signs of shorter duration.

[Florida is having a busy year with this disease. It is difficult to look at a horse with strangles as they look so completely miserable (and they are) that it is really heartbreaking.

Antimicrobial therapy is controversial. Most authors agree that initiation of antibiotic therapy after abscess formation may provide temporary clinical improvement in fever and depression, but ultimately prolongs the course of disease by delaying maturation of abscesses. Antibiotic therapy is indicated in cases with dyspnea, dysphagia, prolonged high fever, and severe lethargy/anorexia (loss of appetite). Administration of penicillin during the early stage of infection (up to 24 hours after onset of fever) will usually abort abscess formation. The disadvantage of early antimicrobial treatment is failure to mount a protective immune response, rendering horses highly susceptible to infection after cessation of therapy. If antimicrobial therapy is indicated, procaine penicillin (22 000 IU/kg, intramuscular injection, twice a day) is the antibiotic of choice.
