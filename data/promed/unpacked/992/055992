[Following on from the report on the effect of use of chemical fertilizer
in India on the incidence of Japanese encephalitis, I would like to pose a
question which could also have an impact on immunization schedules for
travelers. At the last Asia Pacific Travel Health Conference in Bali (July
2000), there was a report on the seroprevalence of Japanese encephalitis,
and the figures given (for Bali) were 46% in pigs and 40%(!) in humans
living in rural areas. Taking into account that there are cross-reactions
with dengue virus, another flavivirus rather common in this geographical
region and even tests of "lower specificity", I still feel that Japanese
encephalitis could be a [significant threat for travelers to Indonesia.
(Remember the publication on the Danish tourist contracting Japanese
encephalitis during a 12 day stay).
Now the question: In Austria we see (or better saw in the pre-vaccination
era) many cases of tick-borne encephalitis (another flavirus-induced
disease) and, despite the fact that there were also single dramatic cases
in children, tick-borne encephalitis seems to have an age-dependent
severity. People growing up in Japanese encephalitis [endemic regions
usually are challenged [infected during childhood, which, on the
tick-borne encephalitis model, could explain the difference between a
rather high seroprevalence rate and by comparison a rather small number of
reported "clinical cases". This would mean that the risk for travelers
deduced from the number of "Japanese encephalitis patients" is
under-estimated.
