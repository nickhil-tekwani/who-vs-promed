Situation update
----------------
Since the China Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA) confirmed its 1st African swine fever (ASF) outbreak in Liaoning Province on 3 Aug 2018, 100 ASF outbreaks have been detected in 23 provinces/autonomous region/municipalities. More than 706 000 pigs have been culled in an effort to halt further spread.

- Heilongjiang Province: ASF outbreak occurred on one farm with approximately 73 000 pigs in Mingshui County, Suihua City [1*].

Actions taken by China [new, since previous weekly FAO update]
---------------------------------------------------------
A dead pig found on Tianpu beach, Jinsha Town, Kinmen County, Taiwan Province on 31 Dec 2018 tested positive for ASF by PCR. The gene sequence was 100% matching with the ASF virus in other parts of China [3*] (additional details are provided in [2] below).

Following assessment, epidemic zones were lifted in Wuxue City, Huanggang City on 27 Dec 2018 [4*] and Lishui County, Huanggang City on 3 Jan 2019 [5*] in Hubei Province; Chenggong District, Kunming City, Yunnan Province on 29 Dec 2018 [6*]; Boyang County, Shangrao City, Jiangxi Province on 29 Dec 2018 [7*]; Gao County, Yibin City on 30 Dec 2018 [8*]; Xinjin County, Chengdu City on 2 Jan 2019 [9*] in Sichuan Province; and Langxia Town, Jinshan District, Shanghai Municipality on 4 Jan 2019 [10*] since there was no further detection for 6 weeks after culling of pigs within an affected zone.

[2] Infected dead pig on Taiwan's Kinmen island shore

Test results conducted on a pig carcass found in Taiwan's offshore Kinmen County came back positive for African swine fever (ASF), the Council of Agriculture (COA) confirmed Thursday [3 Jan 2019]. The dead hog was found Monday [31 Dec 2018] on a beach in Kinmen County's Jinsha Township by Coast Guard personnel just kilometers away from China's southeastern coast, raising concerns that the outbreak of ASF in China could spread to Taiwan.

Samples collected from the dead hog were sent to the COA's Animal Health Research Institute (AHRI) for testing, and Chiu Chui-chang, head of the AHRI, confirmed Thursday [3 Jan 2018] that the results of those tests indicate the pig was infected with ASF. To date, it is not known whether the dead hog floated to Kinmen from China or came from a local farm, according to Hsu Jung-bin, a senior official with the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine.

Authorities have begun carrying out county-wide inspections on Kinmen's hog farms for possible ASF infection, Hsu said. Kinmen currently has 68 farms, with about 11 000 hogs. So far, none of the 190 pigs at a farm close to where the dead pig was found have shown any signs of infection, according to the Kinmen County government.

Meanwhile, Hsu said should any of the pigs exhibit symptoms such as loss of appetite or lethargy, the authorities will carry out sample tests. In the event of a positive test, the hogs will be culled, followed by cleaning and disinfection work on the premises to prevent the virus spreading, he added.

Since the 1st confirmed case of ASF infection in swine was reported in China's Liaoning Province in August [2018], Taiwan has been on high alert, worried that an invasion of the extremely deadly virus could devastate the country's NTD 80 billion (USD 2.58 billion) pig farming industry.

To prevent the ASF virus from reaching Taiwan, the government has slapped heavy fines on passengers who bring in pork products from countries with ASF outbreaks, with 1st-time offenders liable to be fined NTD 200 000 (USD 6500) and repeat offenders NTD 1 million (USD 32 500).

[For the location of Kinmen County, an island close to mainland China, see https://tinyurl.com/yaobfcqv.

A 2nd dead pig was spotted Friday [4 Jan 2019] on a beach in Xiaoqiu islet, Kinmen County, 4 days after the finding of the 1st carcass, at another coastal location in Kinmen. The 2nd dead pig was believed to be brought by the tide, as there are no pig farms on the Kinmen-administrated islet, said Coast Guard Administration (CGA) Director-General Lee Chung-wei. Tests of this case are being applied, with results expected soon. For more details, refer to http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201901040007.aspx. - Mod.AS
