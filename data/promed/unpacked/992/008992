The Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) confirmed the presence of cattle fever ticks on cattle originating from a premises located in portions of Webb and Zapata counties on [26 Apr 2017]. The fever ticks were found on 2 calves undergoing voluntary inspection and treatment at a dipping vat. The infested premises is quarantined and the TAHC is conducting an epidemiological investigation to determine the potential source of the fever ticks and destination of cattle moved from the premises.

A Control Purpose Quarantine Area (CPQA) has been established for systematic inspection of livestock and wildlife hosts in the portions of Webb and Zapata County surrounding the infested premises. TAHC and USDA personnel are contacting owners with premises located in the identified CPQA. The infested premises is located about 8 miles outside of the Permanent Fever Tick Quarantine Zone and about 2 miles from existing Webb and Zapata county CPQAs.

Livestock, exotic livestock, and wildlife hosts on premises located within the CPQA are subject to movement restrictions, systematic inspections and potential treatment in accordance with the regulations in Title 4, Texas Administrative Code, Chapter 41 Fever Ticks [http://txrules.elaws.us/rule/title4_chapter41]. At present, there are about 1.4 million acres [567 000 ha] under various types of fever tick quarantine outside of the Permanent Quarantine Zone. To learn more about the quarantine areas, visit http://www.tahc.texas.gov/animal_health/cattle/#ticks.

"When producers observe ticks on their livestock, it is imperative that they contact their local TAHC Livestock Inspector or region office, USDA Inspector, private veterinarian, or local Texas A&M AgriLifeExtension office to arrange for collection and submission of tick samples to the TAHC laboratory in Austin," said Dr Andy Schwartz, TAHC executive director. "This extra surveillance protects the Texas cattle industry."

Webb and Zapata County CPQAs are a significant threat to the United States cattle industry. These ticks are capable of carrying the protozoa, or microscopic parasites, _Babesia bovis_ or _B. bigemina_, which cause the disease commonly known as cattle fever. The Babesia organism attacks and destroys red blood cells, causing acute anemia, high fever, and enlargement of the spleen and liver, ultimately resulting in death for up to 90 per cent of susceptible naive cattle.

The Texas cattle fever tick represents a great loss to Texas. The recent spread of these ticks spread is quite concerning, because of disease spread, quarantines, a loss of animals and finances to the owner. This particular fever tick has plagued Texas for some time, and was part of the history of Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine (http://vetmed.tamu.edu/about-us/history). Great strides were made against this pest. Then it rallied against the efforts to eliminate it from Texas.

It is a very expensive and time consuming task to eradicate the carrier of this disease. In the 1940s, cattle were dipped in large vats with an arsenic-containing dip. Co-Ral is not an arsenic dip, but rather an organophosphate, which can inhibit cholinesterase. This chemical is a restricted use pesticide, meaning special training and handling are required to use it.
