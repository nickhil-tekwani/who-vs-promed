Human anthrax cases in Murshidabad, West Bengal
---------------------------------------------------
In the last 3 months more than 30 anthrax cases have been reported from
Murshidabad District of West Bengal in India. The cases were found mainly
in the Hariharpara and Domkal areas. In all cases there was a history of
eating meat from a sick cow. In West Bengal this a common practice in all
tribal areas as well as in poor communities -- at least we are getting this
constant history for a pretty long time.
Interestingly, we are not getting cases of intestinal anthrax; as also in
this situation, the main manifestations are blisters and ulcers. As pointed
out by Dr. Hugh-Jones, preventive aspects should be thoroughly explored --
instead of the public awareness programs which are currently practiced in
the affected areas.

[It has been found that populations who regularly eat anthrax-infected
carcasses have a moderate prevalence of antibodies, which, unfortunately or
fortunately -- depending on how one interprets the data -- is believed to
suppress the incidence of clinical disease and thereby provides an excuse
to those communities to continue to eat this high-risk meat. Our thanks to
Dr Das for his informed comments. - Mod.MHJ]
