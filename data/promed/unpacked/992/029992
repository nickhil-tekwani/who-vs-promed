Tick-borne encephalitis prevalence in Austria
---------------------------------------------
What is said for Sweden [see ProMED-mail posts listed below] is true
for Austria this year [2011] as well. Whereas we had about 50-80
(always less than 100) clinical cases [of tick-borne encephalitis,
TBE] per year in the recent past, by 29 Sep 2011 we have already
reached the figure of 100 cases this year (official data from the
Institute for Virology of the Medical University of Vienna) -- which
will result in a negative record like in Sweden since we actually have
a beautiful and warm autumn resulting in plenty of outdoor activities
... and more cases of TBE.

The ultimate challenge here (with 88 percent of the population at
least partially vaccinated against TBE) will be to get people back to
the offices to have their vaccination series completed. It is always
tragic to see people suffering from diseases -- even more when they
are vaccine preventable.

[ProMED-mail welcomes this update on the current TBE situation in
Austria.

Vaccination against TBE is considered to be the most effective means
of preventing TBE for those living in endemic countries. The vaccine
has been used in national vaccination campaigns in Austria since 1982
and has continued on an annual basis since. There is also widespread
use of TBE vaccine in many other central European countries. The
primary course of TBE vaccine consists of 3 doses on days 0, between 1
and 3 months later, and then between 5 and 12 months after the 2nd
dose. If more rapid protection is required, 2 doses of vaccine can be
administered a minimum of 2 weeks apart. In this case the 3rd dose
should be administered 5-12 months after the 2nd vaccination.

Serologic studies indicate that the persistence of TBE immunity is
compromised in the elderly and there is a more rapid decline of
antibodies in those who received only 3 immunisations. The immune
response following booster doses of vaccine is also of lower magnitude
in the elderly compared to that in younger adults. Because of these
findings, booster doses continue to be recommended every 3 years in
adults older than 60 years. (For more information, see
