YELLOW FEVER IN ASIA (5)

This "good" medical geographer has been curious about the question for a
long time, and I finally got a decent answer from Duane Gubler at CDC
when he was at the University of Washington last month. Part of it is
competition from dengue, as previously noted--and there were a couple of
other factors that he speculated about, but no really definitive answer.
I'd really like to put some time and effort into studying the question
more definitively--any collaborators out there?

ubject: Yellow fever in Asia.
Why Yellow Fever has apparently never spread to Asia is still one of
the fascinating questions of arbovirology. A variety of ideas,
possibly acting ttogether, have been proposed including
cross-protection by other flaviviruses, apparent inferior vector
competence of Asian strains of Aedes aegypti and possible ecological
factors (see Monath chapter 51 in the Arboviruses: Epidemiology and
Ecology volume 5. CRC Press 1988. p 171- 172)
The argument that dengue protects against YF is not really valid as
dengue is present in Africa and increasingly in the Americas. If one
looks at the distribution of related flaviviruses it would seem a
better bet to suggest that Japanese encephalitis would fit this
argument better as the westward distribution of JE seems to have
become restricted to Nepal, India and Sri Lanka and the far east of
Pakistan.
One important factor tending to restrict Yellow Fever in Africa to
the rain forest maintenance cycle and working against eastward
spread was probably identified by David Gillett many years ago. He
found that in the East African emergence zones the strains of
Aedes simpsoni (now known to be Aedes bromeliae) were found to be
virtually non-man biting. Thus the link between the forest
maintenance cycle and establishment of an urban Aedes aegypti-man
cycle was broken.
The principal concern today must be that container breeding urban
Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are now at dangerously high levels
in many areas. Dengue viruses transmitted by these mosquitoes are
hyperendemic in S.E. and S. Asia and transmission in the
Americas continues to intensify with severe dengue now being reported
from many areas of the Americas. The risk of YF outbreaks in
endemic areas has therefore never been greater. As the movement of
dengue-viraemic humans is a very important factor in spreading dengue
viruses a similar risk must be considered for Yellow Fever.

Quick comments
Yellow fever does not abound in South America. It is endemic, but only in
its sylvatic habitat where it circulates between forest monkeys, with
occasional monkey to human transmission. The last urban outbreak was many
years ago (Trinidad in 1954 I think). The next outbreak is harder to
predict! Dengue is of course very prevalent in most tropical cities, and
is ubiquitous in South America.
Dengue viruses travel happily between the continents in humans, in jet
planes. For example, the dengue 3 strain that recently arrived in Central
America and is spreading rapidly throughout the region is a Sri Lanka/South
Indian strain. Thus we cannot think in terms of geographically isolated
dengue populations.
The minimum infection rate in wild mosquito populations, even during
epidemics, would reduce the probability of interaction between viruses in
the same mosquito to very low levels, too low to make exclusion of one by
the other a possibility. If there is any mutual exclusion between dengue
and yellow fever it would only be feasible by virtue of the immune system
of the host. However, it is worth mention that both diseases were rampant
in the Americas in the last century.

[- The outbreak in Trinidad was in the early 1980s. YF in Trinidad has always
been of interest because of its close proximity to Venezuela and whether the
virus could maintain itself on the island or whether it depended on "fresh"
deliveries of airborne mosquitoes or whatever. Quoting from memory, the
"1980" outbreak was classical in starting in unvaccinated forest workers.
Affected monkeys were collected and unfortunately held in the Port-of-Spain
zoo. When the PH risk was belatedly appreciated, they were sacrificed.
Basically the more the authorities looked, the more virus they found in the
resident forest monkey population but it was in an "incomplete" form. Because
each virus isolation from yet another monkey resulted in a formal note to WHO
and affected the cruise and tourist trade, the national programme was
terminated. MH-J

There is stringent requirement for evidence of vaccination against YF in
persons coming into Asia from YF endemic areas and this could help explain
why the disease has not made an appearance. I don't think the presence of
dengue or any other members of the flavivirus family has anything to do with
its exclusion since there is no cross immunity in humans. The absence of
monkeys will minimise the chances of survival of the virus in certain parts
of Asia. Reduced capacity of indigenous Aedes aegypti to support YF virus
has not been proven.
The speed of travel and the increase in trade and tourism poses a real
threat and the emergence of YF in Asia is a distinct possibility. This issue
has been discussed in a number of meetings on emerging diseases and it is
recommended that YF-sensitive countries monitor the situation carefully.
