[In Norway, there has only been one outbreak of ND [Newcastle disease] in poultry, in a flock of laying hens on Finnoy in 1997.

On a global basis, ND has been the most loss-making serious infectious disease in poultry production for a long time. In the summer of 2004, Sweden had two cases of ND in poultry and Finland one case in turkey. In Denmark, an outbreak of ND was registered in a non-vaccinated flock of broiler breeding animals. In the winter of 2005, there were 3 cases of ND in poultry in Sweden, two in Ostergotland and one in Scania, and in 2009 one case in a flock of broiler parent animals in Scania.

In Norway, one case of clinical disease was found in a pigeon breed in 1984, and in several other pigeon breeds an antibody against paramyxovirus-1 was found. In 2003, ND was diagnosed in racing pigeons in Buskerud. Paramyxovirus-1 infection was detected in 2012 in a pigeon loft in the Bergen area, after several young pigeons had become ill and had strokes. In 2022, paramyxovirus-1 was detected among urban pigeons in Oslo [See ProMED posting 20220830.8705310). Every year, several outbreaks of paramyxovirus-1 infection occur in pigeons in Europe.

Vaccination protects against the disease. In Norway, it is mandatory to vaccinate pigeons that will participate in exhibitions, competitions, and training flights. It is forbidden to vaccinate other bird species against ND/paramyxovirus-1 in Norway. (Source: Norwegian Veterinary Institute at https://www.vetinst.no/sykdom-og-agens/newcastlesjuke-nd). - Mod.CRD
