2000/158 Melon yellow spot is a new tospovirus
-----------------------------------------------
A tospovirus-like virus was isolated from diseased melons (_Cucumis melo_)
in Japan. This virus was transmitted by _Thrips palmi_ (EPPO A1 quarantine
pest) in a persistent manner, but presented different cytopathological
features from tospoviruses previously reported. Cytopathological,
serological and molecular studies showed that it is a distinct tospovirus
and the name melon yellow spot tospovirus was proposed. However, no
information is given on the disease which is caused by this new tospovirus.

[According to the authors, the melon yellow spot tospovirus differed from
other tospoviruses in several characteristics: natural host range; by ELISA
it was not serologically related to 2 other tospoviruses (tomato spotted
wilt and watermelon silver mottle); the amino acid sequence of the
nucleocapsid (N) protein was similar to those of serogroup IV tospoviruses
(peanut bud necrosis, watermelon silver mottle and watermelon bud
necrosis); and, atypically for tospoviruses, clustering of single-membraned
virions within cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum was not observed. The
provisional name for the virus will be considered for approval by the
International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. - Mod.DH]
