The rate of leptospiral infection [is reported to be 24.39% of 414
slaughterhouse workers in the province of Pichincha (highland region). The
rate in the general population was 11% of 400 patients admitted to public
hospitals with fevers of unknown origin.
In dogs the prevalence was 37.64% (457 samples) and in cattle 44%. In a
long term study (1980-82) cattle infection rates in the coastal region was
41% and in the Andean region 48%.

[It would be of interest if our Ecuadorian members might be able to inform
as to the most common serovars identified with the above surveys. This
would provide a more informative slant on who was being exposed to what. -
