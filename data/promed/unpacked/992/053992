Rampaging rats in the Chinese capital have led health officials to
distribute 250 tons of poison bait throughout the city - in public parks,
sewers, restaurants and food markets and to distribute 300 thousand
pamphlets seeking assistance from citizens in combating the problem.
The newspaper account said there are reports of rats chewing the garments
of guests in big metropolitan hotels and damaging telephone and power
lines. Zhou Yubing, head of Beijing pest control, said rats are commonly
seen downtown during daylight hours, but that the worst problem is in the
sprawling suburbs and rural aspects, where state toleration levels of
rodent density are greatly exceeded. The population explosion in the past
decade has been blamed by experts on the loss of predators, such as owls,
weasels and cats whose diets are composed of hunting remains and not pet
food.
[If these reports are accurate, we can expect disease to follow. We would
like to have a follow up on this situation. - Mod.PC]
