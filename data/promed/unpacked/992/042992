[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 2 049 849 with 82 295 (4.0%) cases reported by China. There are now a total of 1 967 554 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from 213 countries/locations outside mainland China, representing an increase of 51 989 cases when compared with the data on 14 Apr 2020, with the USA accounting for 8526 (16.3%), France 4560 (8.7%), the UK 4603 (8.8%), Turkey 4281 (8.2%), Italy 4694 (9.0%), Spain 3573 (6.8%), Russia 3388 (6.5%) and Belgium 2454 (4.7%) of the newly confirmed cases. The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside China now represents 95.9% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe and the USA. The USA now represents 30.4% of the global cases of COVID-19. A global total of 132 835 deaths have been reported, 129 493 (97.5%) outside mainland China.

The USA is now number one outside China for numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19; Spain is number 2 and Italy is number 3. While the number of daily new cases in Iran has slowed down, Turkey and Russia have shown a rapid increase in the number of cases. The number of cases in Ireland and India has also been accelerating. - Mod.UBA]

[3] WHO situation report 86 (as of 15 Apr 2020)
Date: Wed 15 Apr 2020
Source: WHO [abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200415-sitrep-86-covid-19.pdf


*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CET, 15 Apr 2020

Highlights
----------
- No new country/territory/area reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.
- WHO has published an updated strategic preparedness and response plan to defeat COVID-19. The document takes what we have learned so far about the virus and translates that knowledge into strategic action.
- The 1st UN solidarity flight has departed Addis Ababa carrying vital COVID-19 medical supplies to all African nations. WHO cargo includes one million face masks, as well as personal protective equipment, which will be enough to protect health workers while treating more than 30 000 patients and laboratory supplies to support surveillance and detection.
- PAHO Director, Dr. Etienne, calls for "extreme caution" when transitioning to more flexible social distancing measures.
- There is no evidence that oral poliovirus vaccine protects people against infection with COVID-19 virus. A clinical trial is planned in the USA, and WHO will evaluate the evidence when it is available.
- WHO continues to provide timely and accurate information, in a world where we have an overabundance of information, some accurate and some not.

Subject in focus: WHO providing timely and accurate information to dispel the "infodemic"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"We're not just fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic." -- WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Munich Security Conference, 15 Feb 2020

An infodemic is an overabundance of information, some accurate and some not, that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it. It poses a serious problem for public health since people need this guidance to know what actions to take to protect themselves and others and help mitigate the impact of a disease. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the infodemic is exacerbated by the global scale of the emergency and propagated by the interconnected way that information is disseminated and consumed through social media platforms and other channels. While the infodemic is a major challenge to outbreak response, it presents an opportunity to identify and adapt new preparedness and response tools.

The COVID-19 infodemic spans 4 major thematic areas where people look for trustworthy information and where misinformation and rumors are placed: the cause and origin of the virus and disease; its symptoms and transmission patterns; available treatments, prophylactics and cures; and the effectiveness and impacts of interventions by health authorities or other institutions.

WHO has been managing the infodemic through a wide range of methods, such as timely and accurate technical guidance, scientific briefs and situation reports, regular press conferences, educational videos and trainings, "myth-busters," active engagement on social media platforms and tailored guidance for key sectors such as healthcare, food and agriculture and travel and tourism, among others.

On 7 and 8 Apr 2020, the WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) held a 2-day, global, online consultation on managing the COVID-19 infodemic. The consultation collated ideas from an interdisciplinary group of experts and 1375 webinar participants. Over 500 ideas were also submitted through an online interactive forum. These ideas will form the basis of a COVID-19 infodemic framework to guide actions of governments and public health institutions and will be made available in the coming days.

The framework will be built around 4 key principles:

1. Interventions and messages must be based on science and evidence.
2. This knowledge should be translated into actionable behaviour change messages, presented in ways that are accessible to all sectors of all societies.
3. Governments should reach out to key communities to understand their concerns and information needs, to better tailor advice and messages that can help these communities address their audiences.
4. Strategic partnerships should be formed with social media and technology platforms and stakeholders, along with other relevant stakeholders such as those in academia and civil society.

The consultation highlighted clear themes and needs that will be further developed in the framework. They include, but are not limited to:

- The need for (a) international coordination of the response to the infodemic, even around such basic issues as terminology; and (b) coordinated and integrated methods to manage the flow of information for maximum positive impact. To fill these gaps, an overview and understanding of the distribution and sharing of information is crucial.
- Public trust in the health authority and other relevant authorities is essential to mitigate the negative impact of an infodemic. In order to build and sustain trust, public health agencies and other authorities need to be transparent about developments as they unfold.
- Health education and health literacy are important to help people receive and act on reliable information.
- Resilience to misinformation depends on strong digital and health literacy. To facilitate this, authorities could run information campaigns on how to convey accurate information, in a similar way that they promote personal hygiene.
- Multidisciplinary cooperation is key to an effective response to an infodemic. The range and effectiveness of possible response measures increases in relation to the degree of cooperation between all these actors, across the whole of society.
- Widespread cultural change around the handling of online information may also be necessary (e.g., individuals retracting and deleting inaccurate posts they might have shared).
- Accurate information must be adapted to different cultures, languages and literacy capacities, extending to marginalised and vulnerable communities.
- Health education before a crisis is always hugely valuable.

Managing the COVID-19 pandemic and related infodemic requires swift, regular, coordinated action from multiple sectors of society and government. The timely translation of evidence into knowledge that people can use, adapted to their local cultures, languages and contexts, will continue to be crucial to fighting misinformation and saving lives as the pandemic continues to evolve.
