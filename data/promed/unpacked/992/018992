["Since the beginning of 2020, outbreaks of H5N8 have been continuously reported in several European countries in poultry and/or wild birds. It is more likely that the source of infection in these outbreaks will be contact with wild birds followed by limited local spread.

Veterinary authorities in the affected countries have responded to contain outbreaks in poultry with stamping out measures, heightened surveillance, and recommendations to poultry owners to increase biosecurity.

The OIE Standards, and the transparency of reporting through the OIE's World Animal Health Information System, provide the framework for Veterinary Services to implement effective surveillance, reporting, and controls for avian influenza. Wild bird surveillance can indicate periods of heightened risk, and at these times, measures to improve on-farm biosecurity may reduce the likelihood of exposure of poultry."
