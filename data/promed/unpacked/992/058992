Viet Nam: avian influenza situation
-----------------------------------
As of Fri 29 Jun 2007, the Ministry of Health in Viet Nam has confirmed 2
new human cases of influenza A(H5N1) virus infection, the 1st human cases
to have been reported from Viet Nam since November 2005. Both cases have
been confirmed by the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE)
and by the WHO H5 Reference Laboratory, US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC).
The 1st case is a 29 year old man from Vinh Phuc Province. He developed
symptoms on 10 May [2007] some days after slaughtering poultry for a
wedding. He was admitted to hospital on 15 May and was discharged on 11 June.
The 2nd human is a 19 year old man from Thai Nguyen Province. He developed
symptoms on 20 May [2007] following exposure to poultry at a slaughter
house. He was admitted to hospital on 25 May and remains in hospital in a
stable condition.
To date, there has been no evidence of an epidemiological link between the
human cases, and no evidence of infection in close contacts of the cases.
These human cases have coincided with a large number of new poultry
outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza reported in Viet Nam during
May and June this year [2007].

[A map of the provinces of Viet Nam is available at
<http://www.angelfire.com/co/hongnam/vnmap.html>. Vinh Phuc and Thai Nguyen
are adjacent provinces in the northern region of Viet Nam.
Since May [2007], the Vietnamese authorities have reported outbreaks of
avian influenza in poultry in 18 provinces and cities. They have also
reported 5 human cases (plus a 6th suspected case) and 2 fatalities during
the same period (see the proceeding post in this thread: Avian influenza,
human (104): Viet Nam 20070627.2075). Today's statement from WHO confirms 2
of these cases (making the case total for Viet Nam 95 and the death toll
42). The global total of human H5N1 cases becomes 317 with 191 fatalities.
Further information on the status of the unconfirmed cases is awaited. -
