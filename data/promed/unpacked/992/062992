From June to September 2014, 11 children of indigenous people of the Rio Breu area in Acre State, died with suspected pertussis. 9 of the children were from the Kaxinawa Indigenous Land called HuniKui, and 2 were of the Ashaninka people. One of the victims was 7 years of age, however, the majority were between 1 and 3 months of age.

For the communities to receive medical care, it is necessary to go by a motor canoe to the municipality of Marechal Thaumaturgo is necessary. The closest village, San Jose, can be 8 to 12 hours of additional travel when the level of the river is high, and the hard trip to the farthest town, Jacobina, takes 2 days. When the river is dry, the journey can take up to 4 days with some stretches traveled on foot, carrying the canoe. 2 children did not survive the long journey over the past year.

Although the diagnosis of pertussis has not been confirmed, the symptoms are similar to those of the disease. The disease in older children and in adults was not so severe as it was in the young infants.

[Neonatal pertussis is observed to be especially severe with as much as a 3 percent risk of death. Symptoms can be substantially different with periods of apnea [breathing arrest] sometimes with hypoxia-induced [low oxygen] seizures usually the most common manifestation of infection. The cough is present, but so weak that it may be unrecognized. In these children with so-called malignant pertussis, leukocytosis, particularly with white blood cell (WBC) counts of 30 000 to 100 000 and severe pulmonary hypertension are ominous signs for mortality. In a study comparing neonatal pertussis to other neonatal respiratory infections, pertussis-positive neonates had longer hospital stays, less fever, more apnea and cyanosis spells, and required more days of supplemental oxygen in the hospital and represented all the infants discharged on respiratory supportive care. In such remote areas, the degree, if any, of medical care and the availability of antimicrobials and vaccines are likely to be quite problematic.

A recent publication confirms the safety of maternal pertussis immunization: Kharbanda EO, Vazquez-Benitez G, Lipkind HS, et al: Evaluation of the association of maternal pertussis vaccination with obstetric events and birth outcomes. JAMA. 2014; 312(18): 1897-904; http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1930817).

Acre (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre_(state)) is located in the westernmost part of the Brazil, with a 2-hour time difference from Brasilia. It is bordered clockwise by Amazonas to the north and northeast, Rondonia to the east, the Bolivian department of Pando to the southeast, and the Peruvian regions of Madre de Dios, Ucayali, and Loreto to the south and west. It occupies an area of 152 581.4 sq km, being slightly smaller than Tunisia. - Mod.LL]
