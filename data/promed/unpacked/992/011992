Anthrax continues to haunt farms, livestock in southern Italy
-------------------------------------------------------------
Anthrax is spreading in southern Italy, killing livestock on farms as
far as 50 kilometers (31 miles) from where 3 outbreaks were reported a
week ago [week of 12-16 Sep 2011.

The illness killed cattle, sheep and horses on a further 10 farms
southeast of Naples in the Basilicata and Campania regions, the
Italian Ministry of Health said in an alert dated yesterday [22 Sep
2011] and published online by the Paris-based World Organization of
Animal Health, or OIE.

The disease killed livestock on 5 farms near the town of Corleto
Perticara, 3 farms in the nearby village of Pietrapertosa and one in
the town of Accettura, with the outbreaks ranging from between 30 to
50 kilometers northeast of last week's, according to the notice.

Italy also reported a new outbreak in Montesano sulla Marcellana, in
addition to the 2 farms reported as infected previously. Last week's
notice also included a farm in Padula, about 10 kilometers northwest
of Montesano. In the 10 newly reported cases, anthrax killed a total
of 12 cattle, 4 horses or donkeys and 10 sheep, the OIE said.

The origin of the infection is linked to the introduction of new live
animals, Italy reported in last week's notice, without providing
details. [Presumably unvaccinated stock onto farms with previous
outbreaks. - Mod.MHJ]

The anthrax cases reported last week were the 1st in Italy since
September 2008 [sic; should be 2009], according to the OIE. The
outbreak is continuing and measures in place include movement controls
for livestock and disinfection of infected premises, the animal-health
group said.

[There was a severe epidemic in Basilicata in 2004, with follow-up
cases in 2005, and it will be interesting to see how genomically
associated this epidemic is with that. See: Antonio Fasanella, et al,
2010. Anthrax outbreaks in Italy in 2004: genetic analysis of isolates
and evaluation of risk factors associated with outbreaks. New
Microbiologica 33(1):83-86. Outbreaks in southern Italy are
characteristically of the A1.a strain.

Our thanks to Antonio for his heads up of Fri 23 Sep 2011.
