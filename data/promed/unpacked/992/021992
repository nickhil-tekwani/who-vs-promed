Ebola virus disease, West Africa -- update
------------------------------------------
Guinea
------
Cases and deaths attributable to Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak continue to be reported from newly infected districts (Telimele and Boffa) and some affected districts that had not reported cases for more than 42 days (Conakry and Macenta). Since the last update of Disease Outbreak News of 28 May 2014, 10 new cases and 7 new deaths have been reported. The current evolving epidemiological situation could be partly explained by persistent community resistance in some communities in Gueckedou, Macenta and Conakry [to isolation of apparently healthy contacts].

As of 18:00 on 28 May 2014, a cumulative total of 291 clinical cases of EVD, including 193 deaths, have been reported. The classification of these cases and deaths are as follows:
- confirmed, 172 cases and 108 deaths;
- probable, 71 cases and 62 deaths; and
- suspected, 48 cases and 23 deaths.

The breakdown of cases and deaths by affected area is as follows: Conakry, 53 cases and 27 deaths; Gueckedou, 179 cases and 133 deaths; Macenta, 40 cases and 23 deaths; Kissidougou, 7 cases and 5 deaths; Dabola, 4 cases and 4 deaths, Djinguiraye, 1 case and 1 death; and Boffa, 4 cases and no deaths. [The case totals add up to 288, not 291. - Mod.JW]

The total number of cases in isolation is 13 (9 in Gueckedou, 3 in Telimele, and 1 in Conakry).

The number of contacts under follow-up is 493 (275 in Gueckedou, 125 in Macenta, and 93 in Telimele).

Sierra Leone
------------
As of 18:00 on 29 May 2014, 34 new cases (7 confirmed, 3 probable, and 24 suspected) and one suspected death were reported from 5 districts. This brings the cumulative total number of clinical cases of EVD to 50 (14 confirmed, 3 probable, and 36 suspected) [correct total here appears to be 53 cases - Mod.JW], including 6 deaths (2 confirmed, 3 probable, and 1 suspected). The geographical distribution of these cases and deaths are as follows: Kailahun (37 cases and 6 deaths), Kenema (1 case and 0 death), Koinadugu (1 case and 0 death), Bo (1 case and 0 death), Moyamba and (1 case and 0 death) [correct total here appears to be 41 cases - Mod.JW].

Liberia
-------
As of 29 May 2014, one new suspected case who died in Foya district was reported. The body was transported to and buried in Sierra Leone. The case is being investigated by both Liberia and Sierra Leone.

The number of cases remains subject to change due to reclassification, retrospective investigation, consolidation of cases and laboratory data, and enhanced surveillance.

Community resistance [to hospitalizing apparently healthy contacts to quarantine them - Mod.JW], inadequate treatment facilities and insufficient human resources in certain affected areas are among challenges currently faced by the 3 countries in responding to the EVD outbreak.

WHO response
------------
WHO and its partners have deployed experts to both Sierra Leone and Guinea to support and build capacity of national personnel to mount an effective EVD outbreak response including coordination, disease outbreak investigation, risk assessment, establishment of treatment facilities, case management, infection prevention and control in the newly affected districts, and social mobilization targeting the resistant communities.

In Sierra Leone, WHO and its partners have established a treatment centre in Koindu and are also coordinating the laboratory testing of samples from Kailahun district, Sierra Leone to be tested in Gueckedou, Guinea.

WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.

This update has also been posted on the regional website of the WHO African Regional Office.

[2] Sierra Leone: Freetown infected

Sierra Leone confirms 7 Ebola cases, 2 in Freetown
--------------------------------------------------
Sierra Leone on Friday [30 May 2014] said that it had confirmed 7 cases of Ebola and suspects dozens more amid fears the deadly epidemic gripping West Africa is spreading.

"As of 28 May 2014, there were 2 deaths, 7 confirmed cases, 3 probable cases and 26 suspected cases" of Ebola, said government spokesman Abdulai Bayratay. Of the 26 suspected cases, 23 were registered in the eastern region of Kailahun, where Sierra Leone's 1st fatality from Ebola was confirmed on Monday [26 May 2014]. Another case was in the diamond region of Kono, also in the east, and 2 in the capital Freetown, said Bayratay.

Travel restrictions
-------------------
Sierra Leone has restricted travel in some areas, and reaffirmed an earlier ban on trips to funerals in neighbouring Guinea in a bid to stop the spread of the disease. "I call on the population to avoid human contact in order to minimise the risk of transmission," Health Minister Miatta Kargbo told AFP.

Additional logistical support was being sent to the eastern regions of Kailahun and Kenema, where a 2nd patient died on Tuesday [27 May 2014], said Bayratay. Freetown has received aid from the World Health Organization -- which has sent 12 workers, USD 150 000 and more than 5000 medical kits to ensure the safety of their officers [sic.; I doubt that 12 WHO staff need 480 kits each -- these kits must be intended for distribution throughout the country. - Mod.JW] -- as well as aid from Britain and Ireland.

[3] Sierra Leone
Date: Thu 29 May 2014

West Africa's deadly Ebola outbreak, which has already killed nearly 200 people in Guinea, has crossed the border and claimed its 1st lives in Sierra Leone, placing health authorities across the region on high alert.

The World Health Organization and Medecins sans Frontieres have dispatched teams to the east of the country, while health authorities in the capital [Freetown] are meeting daily to monitor the disease, amid fears that it could spread quickly among remote rural communities with little access to healthcare.

The current outbreak began in neighbouring Guinea in March [2014]. The 1st confirmed cases were detected in Sierra Leone earlier this week [week of 26 May 2014], and the country has now recorded 16 cases and 5 deaths. [This is out of date -- see [2] above. - Mod.JW]

An Ebola task force has been formed at Sierra Leone's Ministry of Health and Sanitation in the capital Freetown, incorporating government and international volunteer healthcare workers.

Shirley Simbo, head of the Voluntary Service Overseas [VSO] Sierra Leone health programme, told The Independent that the outbreak was already being treated as an emergency. "It is causing major concern," she said. "We are currently working together with the Ministry of Health and Sanitation. Every day we have a task force meeting."

The VSO's team of 14 volunteer [doctors?] and nurses was helping government health workers to alert remote communities to the threat and advise on measures to prevent the virus's spread, she said. "The ministry has dispatched its teams to every district. Right now the prevalence is on the eastern side of Sierra Leone. There are still misconceptions in communities, especially rural communities. Some people are still doubtful that it is Ebola that is manifesting in Sierra Leone. Some still think it is cholera."

At an emergency meeting on Wednesday [28 May 2014], the task force heard that Koindu, a town in the eastern Kailahun district, had become the "epicentre" for the outbreak.

In Kenema, Sierra Leone's 3rd largest city, it was confirmed that one of 3 Ebola patients had died after being admitted to hospital. One woman, the daughter of one of the patients admitted to hospital in Kenema, said she had been told by relatives in Koindu that her mother had died. Her mother was among 8 patients said to have been "forcibly removed" from a health centre in the town. Health authorities are particularly concerned that mistrust of healthcare workers in some communities could prevent effective monitoring and prevention of the disease. A team of health workers, who had entered Koindu, have already been "ambushed" and its ambulance "attacked", minutes from Wednesday's [28 May 2014] meeting revealed.

Earlier this week, 6 suspected Ebola patients were taken out of hospitals in Koindu by their families against doctors' orders. One of the patients has since died and the breach is considered a major infection risk. Dr Amara Jambai, director of disease prevention and control at Sierra Leone's health ministry, told the BBC that staff at the clinic had tried to stop them but the families, who were said to have been afraid their loved ones would die alone, became "aggressive".

The government has prioritised 13 key messages, which it is attempting to disseminate to every Sierra Leonean. People have been told to attend the nearest health clinic immediately if they have symptoms of fever, diarrhoea or vomiting. There have also been warnings over hand-washing, and eating bush meat, especially from monkeys, chimpanzees or bats, or eating fruit that might have been eaten by animals. Fruit bats are believed to be the natural host of the virus.

Ebola treatment has been made available free of charge at all health facilities.

Tarik Jasarevic, spokesperson for the World Health Organisation on Ebola, said the outbreak required a "huge social mobilisation activity" to alert the population to the dangers. "We really have to work with the population," he said. "We need to talk to people to use every means, go to religious leaders, to village chiefs to explain what EVD is. If you come to a village without preparing you can encounter some resistance."

EVD has also been detected in Liberia during the outbreak, but no new cases have been recorded since April [2014]. There is no cure or vaccine for Ebola, but people have a much better chance of survival if the virus is detected early.

[The earlier WHO figures for Guinea are also confusing:

"As of 18:00, 27 May 2014, the total cumulative number of cases due to EVD is 281 and 186 deaths. The classification of these cases and deaths are as follows:
- confirmed (163 cases and 103 deaths);
- probable (66 cases and 56 deaths) and
- suspected (44 cases and 23 deaths)."

These figures add up to total 273 cases and 182 deaths (not 281 and 186 as above).

So it is difficult to confirm how many new cases and deaths have occurred in Guinea between 18:00 on 27 May 2014 and 18:00 on 29 May 2014 above.

But in any case, 10 new cases and 7 new deaths in 2 days in Guinea is of great concern, as are 34 new cases including one more suspected death in 2 days in Sierra Leone (38 cases and 2 deaths according to government spokesman Abdulai Bayratay -- see [2] above), and the new suspect case in Liberia, after it was declared EVD free on 22 May.

The Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation has issued an Ebola Virus Disease - Situation Report (SitRep) dated 29 May 2014 giving the following information: "A total of 36 suspected cases have been reported with 14 confirmed cases all from Kailahun districts. 7 new EVD laboratory confirmed cases from Kailahun districts. All suspected cases from Bo, Koinadugu and Western area urban are negative." There is no mention of any cases in Freetown.

In-country travel restrictions will not work without police (or military) roadblocks, and it will probably be unacceptable to stop travel to funerals of relatives across the border.

WHO continues to recommend that no travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone, but may have to reconsider in the light of the reinfection of the capital city of Guinea (Conakry) and the new infection of the capital city of Sierra Leone (Freetown),
