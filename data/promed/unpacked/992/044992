-----------------------------------------------------------
Though they do not report Hepatitis E separately, the Ministry of Health's Epidemiologic Bulletin also lists 13 cases of "other acute hepatitis" and 148 cases of "unspecified hepatitis" across Venezuela in the table of cases by cause and age group. [1] It seems likely that a good portion of these "non-ABCD" hepatitis cases may be attributable to hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection.

A recently-published paper by Cristina Gutierrez Garcia and colleagues [2] assessed the prevalence of anti-HEV IgM among acute clinical hepatitis cases seen at the National Institute of Hygiene "Rafael Rangel" in Caracas in 2008. They detected anti-HEV IgM in 22/74 total acute viral hepatitis patients (30%) and were able to amplify HEV RNA (genotypes 1 and 3) from three patients. Co-infection with hepatitis A virus infection (HAV) was noted in 12 anti-HEV IgM+ patients,
representing 31% (12/39) of all hepatitis A patients seen and over half (12/22) of the hepatitis E cases.

The authors report that most of the patients with HEV were from the Capital District (i.e., Caracas area), followed by Miranda State -- both adjacent to Vargas State -- with one case each from Bolivar and Yaracuy States. A lack of recent travel in patient histories suggests these HEV cases were autochthonously acquired.

Thus, it would appear HEV is also a common cause of acute viral hepatitis in this region of Venezuela, and HAV-HEV co-infection may be frequent among both HAV and HEV cases coming to clinical attention.

Joining hepatitis A and B, hepatitis E may now also be considered "vaccine-preventable". [3] An efficacious HEV vaccine (Hecolin, Xiamen Innovax Biotech) was approved by the Chinese government in the past year. This vaccine has not yet been tested or licensed for use outside China, nor have its safety and efficacy been specifically evaluated in pregnant women or children. However, this is the first time an HEV vaccine will enter the market, and the company claims to be pursuing pre-qualification with WHO in anticipation of international distribution [4]. Given the impact of HEV in developing countries (as well as in high-risk populations in industrialized countries) -- which is generally under-appreciated due to limited surveillance -- this is a welcome development, though much work remains to be done to ensure that new HEV vaccines (and water/sanitation interventions) reach populations most in need.

The update on hepatitis E virus vaccine development is greatly appreciated, as are the comment regarding the extent of HAV/HEV co-infection and the limited surveillance for HEV infection. - Mod.CP
