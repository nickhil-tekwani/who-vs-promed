Susceptibility of white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) to SARS-CoV-2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The origin of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing the global coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, remains a mystery. Current evidence suggests a likely spillover into humans from an animal reservoir. Understanding the host range and identifying animal species that are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection may help to elucidate the origin of the virus and the mechanisms underlying cross-species transmission to humans. Here we demonstrated that white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_), an animal species in which the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) -- the SARS-CoV-2 receptor -- shares a high degree of similarity to humans, are highly susceptible to infection. Intranasal inoculation of deer fawns with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in established subclinical viral infection and shedding of infectious virus in nasal secretions. Notably, infected animals transmitted the virus to non-inoculated contact deer. Viral RNA was detected in multiple tissues 21 days postinoculation (pi). All inoculated and indirect contact animals seroconverted and developed neutralizing antibodies as early as day 7 pi. The work provides important insights into the animal host range of SARS-CoV-2 and identifies white-tailed deer as a susceptible wild animal species to the virus.

This experiment adds a new mammal family (Cervidae) to those known to be compatible for SARS-CoV-2 infection. White-tailed deer and other cervids are farmed worldwide, and thus they are at risk of exposure to infected people. The fact that white-tailed deer can infect other conspecifics, as also can cats and minks, raises concern and urges surveillance and biosafety efforts in deer farms. - Mod.PMB]
