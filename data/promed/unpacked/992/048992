The North Coast Public Health Unit in northern New South Wales (NSW) has reported 2 cases of the vaccine-preventable disease diphtheria in 2 children.

The 1st case is in a 2-year-old unvaccinated child who is currently being cared for in an intensive care unit (ICU) at a Queensland hospital and has received diphtheria antitoxin, antibiotics, and respiratory support.

The 2nd case is in a 6-year-old child who is a close family contact of the 1st case. The child, who was not vaccinated against diphtheria, is currently being cared for at a Northern NSW Local Health District hospital.

These are the 1st cases of diphtheria of the throat in NSW since the 1990s.

The children's close contacts have received post-exposure prophylaxis, which can include antibiotics and immunization, to reduce the risk of transmission.

Dr Paul Douglas, Director North Coast Public Health, said the risk to the broader community is low. "However, this is a very serious disease and can be fatal, so families should be alert and review the immunization status of their children on the Australian Immunization Register or with their medical provider to ensure they are update with all vaccinations," Dr Douglas said.

"Diphtheria is very rare in Australia due to our longstanding childhood immunization program. The diphtheria vaccination is free and readily available from your GP for everyone from 6 weeks of age. It is important that everyone keeps up to date with their vaccinations."

Diphtheria is a contagious, vaccine-preventable disease that is spread mainly through respiratory droplets during close contact with a person who has the bacteria. While no other cases of throat diphtheria have been reported in NSW since the 1990s, on rare occasions other less serious cases of diphtheria have been reported, mainly involving the skin.

According to NSW Health, prevention of diphtheria is through vaccination. Vaccination against diphtheria is part of the childhood immunizations and is given in combination with other vaccines known as 'DTP' vaccine, which contains vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (whooping cough). The DTP vaccine should be given at 2, 4, 6, and 18 months of age, followed by booster doses at 4 years and at 15 years of age. A high vaccination rate in the community is important to protect everyone from the disease. In 2021, over 90% of Australian children under 6 years of age were fully immunized against diphtheria (Australian Childhood Immunization Register (ACIR) statistics).

[Humans are the only reservoir of _ Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, the cause of diphtheria. Transmission of _C. diphtheriae_ can occur through respiratory droplets, direct contact with cutaneous infections, and articles soiled with discharges from the respiratory tract or skin lesions. Travel to an endemic area is a risk factor for the acquisition of _C. diphtheriae_. _Corynebacterium ulcerans_ and _Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis_ cause zoonotic infection in humans (http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/prevguid/m0051752/m0051752.asp), and contact with a companion animal is also a risk factor for acquisition of _C. ulcerans_.

Diphtheria is a potentially fatal disease caused by toxigenic strains of _C. diphtheriae_, _C. ulcerans_, or _C. pseudotuberculosis_, aerobic Gram positive bacilli that can cause respiratory tract or cutaneous diphtheria. Toxin production occurs only when the bacilli are infected by a specific bacteriophage that carries the gene encoding the toxin.

Diphtheria toxin inhibits cellular protein synthesis, which is responsible, in respiratory diphtheria, for tissue destruction and thick membrane formation in the respiratory tract, which can obstruct the airway. Diphtheria toxin is also responsible for the other major complications of diphtheria: myocarditis, polyneuropathy (for example, paralysis of the soft palate, eye muscles, limbs, and diaphragm), and kidney damage.

Diphtheria can be prevented by a diphtheria toxoid vaccine, which is available combined with tetanus toxoid, both in full-strength doses (denoted by upper case letters "DT") in pediatric formulations and in reduced-strength doses combined with a full-strength dose of tetanus toxoid (denoted by upper case T and lowercase d, "Td") in adult formulations. These are combined with acellular or whole-cell pertussis antigens in full-strength pediatric formulations (DTaP, DTwP) or in reduced strength in the adolescent/adult formulations (Tdap).

Non-toxin-producing strains may cause mild to moderate pharyngitis. Although either toxigenic or nontoxigenic strains can cause cutaneous diphtheria, toxic cardiac or neurologic manifestations are uncommon in cutaneous diphtheria, even when caused by toxigenic strains. Acquisition of _C. diphtheriae_ can occur even in vaccinated contacts since vaccine-induced immunity is anti-toxin.

Although diphtheria is now rare in Australia, in the 1st half of the 20th century, at the height of the 1921 epidemic, there were 23 199 notifications (annual notification rate 426 per 100 000 population) and, in the decade between 1926 and 1935, there were 4043 deaths from diphtheria (http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-pubs-cdi-2000-cdi2406-cdi2406f.htm).

In Australia, a 5-dose DTP vaccine series has been recommended and funded on a national basis since 1975 (https://www.ncirs.org.au/sites/default/files/2018-11/Diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-history-July-2018.pdf). Currently, DTaP is given at 2, 4, 6, and 18 months and 4 years of age (https://immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au/contents/vaccine-preventable-diseases/diphtheria). In 2021, over 90% of Australian children under 6 years of age were fully immunized against diphtheria (https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/factsheets/Pages/diphtheria.aspx).

Respiratory diphtheria is treated with diphtheria antitoxin and antibiotics. Td vaccination is recommended for the patient's close contacts (that is, those who may have been exposed to respiratory secretions or who are close household contacts) if Td has not been administered within the last 5 years. These contacts should have nasal and pharyngeal specimens obtained for culture and should also be given antibiotic prophylaxis (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/dip.html). - Mod.ML
