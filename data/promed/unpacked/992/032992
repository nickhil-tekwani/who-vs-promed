Dazhu County, the latest bird flu outbreak site in southwest China's
Sichuan Province, has shut down all its 54 live poultry markets amid
efforts to prevent the spread of the epidemic.
Sales of poultry, eggs and related products have been banned in the county
since Tuesday [3 Jan 2006] when the Ministry of Agriculture announced that
bird flu had broken out in Dazhu, said Yang Yue, deputy director of the
Sichuan Provincial Bureau for Industry and Commerce.
Local residents remain calm and the price of other kinds of meat in the
market has not changed, Yang said.
"Residents understand the situation and no obstruction was encountered in
closing the live poultry markets," he said.
A total of 163 law enforcement officials have been dispatched to supervise
the local markets, he said. "If no new bird flu outbreak is reported in
Dazhu within 21 days, the live poultry markets can be reopened," Yang said.
The Municipal Bureau for Industry and Commerce of Dazhou City, the highest
authority in Dazhu County, has banned sales of live poultry in all its
counties.
Hong Kong has decided to suspend imports of live poultry and poultry meat
from Sichuan, the Health, Welfare and Food Bureau of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) government said on Wednesday [4 Jan 2006].
Between 22 and 25 Dec 2005, 1800 chickens and ducks died in 3 households in
Yangjia Town's Liuyan Village. On 3 Jan 2005, the Ministry of Agriculture
confirmed the outbreak of H5N1 bird flu there.
Migratory birds have been blamed for the latest outbreak of bird flu in
Dazhu, China Daily reported on Thursday, citing Su Lin of the Sichuan
Provincial Department of Health.
Nobody has been infected with the H5N1 virus in Dazhu, as the blood tests
of all the 16 people in close contact with the dead poultry have proved
negative, said Su, chief of the Emergency Response Office in the department.
Su said that Dazhu, some 400 km east of provincial capital Chengdu, is
where migratory birds from North China such as white cranes stop before
flying further south to spend winter.
Although most migratory birds from the north have left Sichuan for the
south, some remain and will not leave until Spring Festival, which starts
on 29 Jan 2006, said the official.
The Ministry of Agriculture had sent an expert team to Dazhu to direct
control efforts. In line with China's animal epidemic prevention
regulations, the Dazhu epidemic site will undergo quarantine isolation for
a minimum of 21 days.

[Attributing the spread of H5N1 to wild birds, though plausible, remains --
so far -- hypothetical, based upon circumstantial evidence. For such a
hypothesis to be validated, the virus should be detectable in viable birds
at the end of a long-distance flight, while excluding the introduction of
the virus by other means, such as transported animals or their products. In
the absence of a solid alternative explanation, this question remains open.
