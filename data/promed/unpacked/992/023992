----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
An active case detection approach with PCR diagnosis was used in the Ho District of the Volta Region, Ghana, that identified individuals with active cutaneous leishmaniasis. 3 isolates were successfully cultured and DNA sequences from these were analysed (ribosomal RNA internal transcribed spacer 1; ribosomal protein L23a intergenic spacer; RNA polymerase II large subunit), showing them to be leishmania, identical to each other but different from all other known _Leishmania_ spp. Phylogenetic analysis showed the parasites to be new members of the _Leishmania enriettii_ complex, which is emerging as a possible new subgenus of _Leishmania_ parasites containing human pathogens.

Highlights from the paper
-------------------------
The phylogenetic analysis showed the Ghanaian parasites to be members of the _L. enriettii_ complex, a possible new subgenus of _Leishmania_ parasites. To date, the evidence for a new subgenus is by inference from phylogenetic analyses. Members of the _L. enriettii_ complex are clearly not placed within any of the existing subgenera.

There is little to no current information on natural reservoir hosts for any species in the _L. enriettii_ complex.

The _L. enriettii_ complex consistently appears as the most basal clade within the leishmania, excluding paraleishmania, an informal grouping that requires re-classification but is not regarded as _Leishmania_ spp. sensu stricto. Thus, what emerges is an early diverging group of parasites that has become geographically widely dispersed, distributed among a wide diversity of hosts, but including some species with the potential to cause human disease.

One of the most intriguing aspects of the _L. enriettii_ complex is the identity of the vectors responsible for transmission, which have not been established with certainty for any species. However, recent evidence indicates that day-biting midges are responsible for transmitting leishmaniasis to kangaroos in Australia (Dougall et al, 2011). Therefore, it is possible that midges may be involved in transmission of the Ghanaian parasites, despite the presence of candidate sand flies.

[The full paper is available at the source URL above. It is an interesting description of a new subtype of leishmania isolated from patients with cutaneous lesions. Phylogenetic analysis indicate that the _L. enriettii_ and related subspecies are ancestral types of leishmania.

As pointed out in the paper, many questions remain unanswered, but especially the reservoir and vector are important. The authors speculate that the vector may not be sand flies but biting midges, which would be a new vector for transmission of leishmania to humans. - Mod.EP
