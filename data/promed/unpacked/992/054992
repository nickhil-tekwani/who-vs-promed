Equine flu remains an ongoing concern as the confirmed number of outbreaks is on the rise.

The latest update from the Animal Health Trust shows 22 outbreaks this month [June 2019], up to and including 18 Jun [2019]: one in Scotland, 9 in Wales, and 12 in England. The outbreaks relate to unvaccinated horses except one thoroughbred in Essex, diagnosed on 2 Jun [2019], who was "presumed" vaccinated. This follows 20 outbreaks in May and 12 in April [2019].

Of the outbreaks in June [2019], one horse had recently arrived from the Netherlands. The remainder do not relate to imported horses.

On 11 Jun [2019], a diagnosis was confirmed in 2 non-thoroughbreds at an event in Cumbria with reports of "several other" horses affected at the event. A non-thoroughbred in Manchester and one in Sussex were diagnosed on 17 Jun [2019], having recently returned from an event in Cumbria.

Five horses who had recently arrived from a sale were diagnosed in Carmarthenshire on 14 Jun [2019], while horses were diagnosed at 5 separate premises across Swansea.

The British Equestrian Federation's most recent advice urges owners to continue to maintain vigilance and ensure vaccination records are up to date.

Equine influenza is a very effective virus that spreads rapidly between horses that don't have antibodies to protect them

"We strongly recommend that if it has been longer than 6 months since the last vaccination, owners should discuss a booster with their veterinary surgeon," the statement said. "It is also vital that unvaccinated horses do not mix with other equines due to the increased risk of such an infectious disease spreading.

"Our recommendations are based on advice from experts in equine flu and epidemiology with experience in managing previous outbreaks."

[Equine influenza (EI), an OIE-listed disease, is an acute respiratory infection of horses, donkeys, mules, and zebras caused by 2 distinct subtypes (H7N7, formerly equi-1, and H3N8, formerly equi-2) of influenza A virus within the genus _Influenzavirus A_ of the family Orthomyxoviridae. According to OIE's Manual, chapter 3.5.7 (last adopted May 2016), EI viruses [EIV] of the H7N7 subtype have not been isolated since the late 1970s (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.05.07_EQ_INF.pdf).

Most likely, the new cases are caused by the same virus strain circulating in the UK since early 2019, namely EIV H3N8 Florida clade 1, recently recorded in several other western European countries. It has been suspected to cause clinical disease in some vaccinated animals.

While normally confined to equids, EIV H3N8 has crossed the species barrier to dogs. Infections of dogs have been reported in North America, generally producing mild fever and coughing, but fatal pneumonias have been recorded. Although EI has not been shown to cause disease in humans, serological evidence of infection has been described, primarily in individuals with an occupational exposure to the virus.

EI is not officially reportable in the UK; the cited number and locations of the published cases is based upon information from non-governmental sources. - Mod.AS
