Highlights
----------
- In week 6, the number of new confirmed cases increased from 58 in week 5, 2022, to 77 cases. These were reported from Ondo, Edo, Bauchi, Ebonyi, Taraba, Enugu, Benue, Kogi, Nasarawa, and Niger states and the FCT (Table 3).
- Cumulatively from week 1 to week 6, 2022, 59 deaths have been reported with a CFR of 16.5%, which is lower than the CFR for the same period in 2021 (22.9%).
- In total for 2022, 19 states have recorded at least one confirmed case across 65 LGAs (Figures 2 and 3).
- Of all confirmed cases, 73% are from Ondo (32%), Edo (23%), and Bauchi (18%) states.
- The predominant age group affected is 21-30 years (range: 1-80 years, median: 30 years). The male-to-female ratio for confirmed cases is 1:0.8 (Figure 4).
- The number of suspected cases is higher than that reported for the same period in 2021.
- 7 new health-care workers affected from Bauchi, Ondo, and Edo states in the reporting week 6.
- National Lassa fever multi-partner, multi-sectoral Technical Working Group (TWG) continues to coordinate the response activities at all levels.

Response activities
-------------------
- Lassa fever alert letters sent to states.
- The national emergency operations centre alert mode level 2 activated for effective multi-sectoral, multi-disciplinary coordination of Lassa fever response.
- Lassa fever preparedness assessment carried out for 36 states and the federal capital territory (FCT).
- State public health emergency operations centre activated in affected states.
- The 7 Lassa fever molecular laboratories in the NCDC network are working at full capacity to ensure that all samples are tested and results provided within the shortest turnaround time.
- Confirmed cases are treated at identified treatment centres across the states.
- Dissemination of reviewed case management and safe burial practices guidelines.
- Dissemination of reviewed IPC guideline and health facility IPC advisory.
- Risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies.
- Implementation of Lassa fever environmental response campaign in high-burden states by Federal Ministry of Environment.
- Distribution of medical response commodities to states and treatment centres.
- Deployment of national rapid response teams to Nasarawa, FCT, Edo, Ondo, Bauchi, Ebonyi, Oyo, Taraba, and Benue

Notes on this report
--------------------
Data source
Information for this disease was case-based data retrieved from the national Lassa fever emergency operations centre.

Case definitions
- Suspected case: any individual presenting with one or more of the following: malaise, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia, chest pain, hearing loss, and either
a. history of contact with excreta or urine of rodents;
b. history of contact with a probable or confirmed Lassa fever case within a period of 21 days of onset of symptoms; or
c. any person with inexplicable bleeding/hemorrhage
- Confirmed case: any suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, PCR, or virus isolation)
- Probable case: any suspected case (see definition above) who died or absconded without collection of a specimen for laboratory testing
- Contact: anyone who has been exposed to an infected person, or to an infected person's secretions, excretions, or tissues within 3 weeks of last contact with a confirmed or probable case of Lassa fever

Calculations
- Case fatality rate (CFR) for this disease is reported for confirmed cases only.

[There were 77 new confirmed and 278 new suspected Lassa fever (LF) cases in week 6: (7-13 Feb 2022), indicating that Lassa fever (LF) virus transmission is increasing. There were 11 deaths among the confirmed cases for week 6, 2022. Unfortunately, there are 7 newly infected health-care workers during the current week (week 6).

The report above confirms that Edo, Ondo, and Bauchi states have the most confirmed cases. The number of states affected increased to 19 so far this year (2022), and the number of local government areas (LGAs) with at least one case is 65.

Nigeria is now in the period of higher case numbers. Case numbers are increasing and likely to increase further in the coming weeks. The graph in Figure 6 indicates that a peak of cases occurred between weeks 4 and 11 in recent years and is the case again so far for the year 2022.

Transmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within health-care facilities. It is encouraging to learn from this and previous reports that risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies for avoidance of contact with rodent virus reservoirs and their excreta.

Images of the rodent reservoirs of Lassa fever virus:

One hopes that the ongoing public information campaign will help the local population to avoid the entry of these reservoir rodents into their houses and other buildings. - Mod.TY
