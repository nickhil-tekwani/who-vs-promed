This is concerning the posting that mentions canned dog food and
possible human exposures.
Our laboratory worked closely with a veterinarian from Diamond Pet
Food and small animal veterinarians in New York to diagnose the
problem and detect aflatoxin in the pet food, but thus far the
affected food has been of the dry type sold in bags as far as I know.
Over the past week, the New York State Animal Health Diagnostic
Center and Cornell University Hospital for Animals have received
hundreds of calls and emails and dozens of samples from veterinarians
and pet owners all along the East Coast of the US. Veterinarians
across the state and in other diagnostic laboratories have told me
they are similarly overwhelmed.
The possibility for human exposure has not been lost on us. One
veterinarian calling my lab stated that a child was found ingesting
Diamond brand dog food from a contaminated lot out of the family
dog's bowl. The family was referred to their pediatrician.
