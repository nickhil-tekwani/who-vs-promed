[Italy has had positive farms this year (2009) in the Piedmont,
Sardinia, and Sicily provinces. The earliest infections were
subclinical and seen in the Piedmont region starting late December
2008. There were 16 farms involved in January and February of this
year, all being detected through the routine surveillance program.
Sardinia, on the other hand, has seen a relative uptick in positive
diagnostic activity in April and May (2009) with 58 farms testing
positive. Sicily only had 2 outbreaks. The outbreak was declared over
on 7 Jul 2009. Unfortunately, we have had to reverse course again as
this new positive, picked up by surveillance in the Piedmont region,
may signal more cases until the bluetongue season winds down in a
month or so from now. - Mod.PC]
