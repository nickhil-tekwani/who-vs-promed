An outbreak of _Escherichia coli_ infection in Denmark that has affected more than 60 people in less than a month has been linked to spring onions from Egypt.

Enteroinvasive _E. coli_ (EIEC) is usually associated with travel diarrhea, but the 68 patients in the outbreak have not traveled abroad. An investigation by the Statens Serum Institut (SSI), Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (Fodevarestyrelsen), local hospitals, and the DTU (Technical University of Denmark) Food Institute found the probable source of infection was spring onions used in ready-to-eat salads sold in 3 different retail chains.

From 23 Nov to 17 Dec [2021], 68 infections have been registered, including 43 women and 25 men aged 1-91 years (median age 53y). Twenty people have been admitted to hospitals, and patients live across the country, except for the Nordjylland region. EIEC has been isolated from more than 20 patients, and the remaining are PCR positive for the invasion plasmid antigen H (ipaH) gene, which is specific to _Shigella_ species and EIEC.

SSI has interviewed 17 patients, and a common food source for 11 of them is ready-to-eat salads. Assessment of purchasing data showed the salads were bought from 15-30 Nov [2021]; 6 people have provided enough information for the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration to identify at least 3 types of salads and a Danish producer. Officials inspected the producer, and findings showed that common ingredients for all the implicated ready-to-eat salads were spring onions from a Dutch supplier but originating in Egypt.

Investigation and traceback work are ongoing to discover how the salads were contaminated with _E. coli_, but initial results are that it didn't happen in Denmark. Salads were sold at REMA1000, COOP, and Meny stores. They have a short shelf life of 6 days, and potentially contaminated batches of spring onions are thought to be no longer on the market, as delivery dates were between 16-30 Nov [2021].

EIEC can cause intestinal infections and is typically seen among travelers. It is closely related to shigella. EIEC is transmitted from person to person or through drinking and bathing water, as well as foods contaminated with human or animal feces. Microscopic amounts of feces can cause illnesses.

The time between being infected and symptoms occurring is typically 1-3 days. Infection can cause diarrhea, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, or a fever lasting several days and usually goes away on its own. Plenty of fluids are important to prevent and treat dehydration related to diarrhea and vomiting. In case of severe diarrheal disease, consult a doctor or go to an emergency room.

[Spring onions are also referred to as scallions or green onions.

A number of _E. coli_ strains have acquired virulence factors to become pathogens that could be called enteropaths, diarrheagenic _E. coli_. These strains differ relating their virulence factors, and clinical manifestations are referred to as
- enterotoxigenic _E. coli_ (ETEC)
- enteropathogenic _E. coli_ (EPEC)
- enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC)
- enteroaggregative _E. coli_ (EAEC)
- enteroinvasive _E. coli_ (EIEC)
- diffusely adherent _E. coli_ (DAEC)

In the past, most clinical laboratories were unable to specifically identify any of these except for EHEC. Newer technologies using multiplex PCR (polymerase chain reaction) have become available and are spreading from reference to more standard clinical laboratories to test for a cluster of organisms, including
- Enteric adenovirus
- Astrovirus
- Norovirus
- Rotavirus A
- Sapovirus
- cryptosporidium
- _Cyclospora cayetanensis_
- _Entamoeba histolytica_
- _Giardia lamblia_
- _Campylobacter (jejuni, coli and upsaliensis_)
- _Clostridium difficile_ (toxin A/B)
- _Plesiomonas shigelloides_
- salmonella
- shigella
- _Yersinia enterocolitica_
- _Vibrio (parahaemolyticus_, _vulnificus_, and _cholerae_)
- enteroaggregative _E. coli_ (EAEC)
- enteropathogenic _E. coli_ (EPEC)
- enterotoxigenic _E. coli_ (ETEC)
- enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC)
- enteroinvasive _E. coli_ (EIEC)

EIEC is a human enteric pathogen that causes dysentery and is transmitted through contaminated food or water and person-to-person contact (1). Infections occur most commonly in developing countries (1,2). The 1971 outbreak in the United States was associated with imported cheese (3). More recently, contaminated vegetables were implicated in outbreaks in Italy in 2012 and the United Kingdom in 2014 (4,5). A 2018 outbreak investigation did not reveal the specific vehicle through which EIEC was transmitted.
