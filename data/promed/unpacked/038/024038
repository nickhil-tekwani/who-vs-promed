In the Oghuz region of the Kharkiv oblast, boy [15 years old - Mod.NP] died from rabies after being bitten by [his family's] rabid cat; the boy was a resident of the village of Artemieva.

According to the locally administered emergency anti-epidemic Commission, the rabies epizootic situation in the Pecheneg area remains tense. The number of people who are referred for medical attention with a suspicion of rabies is growing. The reason is the increase in the number of homeless animals and red foxes. The 15-year-old boy fed the cat, which showed aggressiveness and bit him. This case occurred in December 2014, but information appeared in the media only at the end of July 2015.

The boy's parents found the behavior of the animal as "inadequate" and killed it, but did not seek medical help for their son in a timely manner.

Meanwhile, in Ukraine there is a shortage of specific anti-rabies vaccine and immunoglobulin, and a number of other vaccines for specific prevention of infectious diseases. - see http://podrobnosti.mk.ua//2015/07/08/v-ukraine-do-sih-por-net-vakciny-ot-beshenstva-postradavshih-ot-ukusov-spasayut-v-rossii.html>

[The cat clearly showed abnormal behaviour, as it caused the boy's parents to kill it. They must have known this cat well enough to determine that its behaviour was unusual. Which, sadly yet again, reinforces the advice that any bite from an abnormally behaving animal is reason to immediately go for medical attention to the wound, immunoglubulin injection, and vaccination. Prompt treatment successfully prevents human rabies deaths. Being casual ensures that if the wound is infected, you die unpleasantly.
