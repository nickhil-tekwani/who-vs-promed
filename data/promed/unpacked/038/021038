EUR 125m [USD 160.3m] of pork to be destroyed in biggest food scare since BSE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
An estimated 100 000 pigs will have to be destroyed because of the pig meat
crisis, which has led to the recall of all Irish pork products in Ireland's
largest food scare since BSE [bovine spongiform encephalitis]. The public
has been told to dump or return all pork products, which they purchased
since 1 Sep 2008 because of the risk of dioxin contamination. It is
estimated that EUR 125 million [USD 160.3 million] worth of food products
in home and in export markets -- up to 25 countries -- will have to be
destroyed.

The recall followed the discovery of potentially dangerous dioxins in pig
meat. They were initially traced in an unnamed meat plant in the Republic.
The dioxins were contained in feed supplied from a Co Carlow food recycling
plant, it emerged yesterday [7 Dec 2008].

As the Government moved to ease the fears of consumers, investigations
continued at 10 pig farms and 38 beef farms in the Republic. The
contamination is likely to have a severe impact on the EUR 7 billion (about
USD 9 million) Irish food industry.

It emerged yesterday [7 Dec 2008] [that] contaminated feed from the Co
Carlow facility, Millstream Recycling in Clohamon Mills, had also been
supplied to 9 farms in Northern Ireland, which now have been restricted.

The investigation has found contaminated pork with dioxin levels of 80 to
200 times above the safety limits. It is being led by the Departments of
Agriculture and Health, and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).
The Garda Siochana [Irish police force] are also involved.

The dramatic food recall was announced on Saturday night [6 Dec 2008] as
the investigation into the source of the contamination, understood to be
oil, was stepped up after tests at a UK laboratory in York confirmed the
presence of dioxins in the pig meat.

The crisis began, however, last month [November 2008] when a routine sample
was taken from the meat plant. Results of further tests from cattle farms
will be known later today [8 Dec 2008]. Other examination of Irish products
in the Netherlands, France, and Belgium prompted the action by the
government in an attempt to protect consumer confidence at home and abroad.

The European Commission has called a meeting of food safety experts from
Ireland and other affected EU states tomorrow to coordinate a Europe-wide
response to the contamination of Irish pork products.

Millstream Recycling has confirmed it has been working with Department of
Agriculture officials to identify the source of PCBs [polychlorinated
biphenyls; related to but not synomymous with dioxins. - Mod.SH] found in
pig meal used in a number of farms in Ireland. Accepting the need for a
recall, Millstream Recycling said it would be carrying out "a full
investigation to establish how the company's strict health and safety
procedures and the high quality standards could possibly have been breached."

Last night [7 Dec 2008] the FSAI repeated its advice to consumers not to
eat any pork products. But it said people should not be alarmed or
concerned in relation to the potential risks from short-term exposure to
dioxins found in pork products.

Dr Tony Holohan, chief medical officer at the Department of Health, said a
number of health studies conducted in Belgium since the dioxin scare in
1999 had not found any negative effects on the population. "From the
experience in Belgium we don't anticipate any health effects and on that
basis we are reassuring people."

Prof James Heffron, a specialist on the biochemistry of detoxification at
UCC's [University College Cork] biochemical toxicology lab, told The Irish
Times, however, the Government in his view needed to do more to reassure
the public. Prof Heffron said information on the amount of dioxin found in
affected meat should be released in addition to further details on the
duration of exposure. "When we have this information we can relate it to
World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on acceptable levels of dioxin,"
he added.

The recall led to almost 2000 calls to the FSAI helpline yesterday [7 Dec
2008]. Queues formed at supermarkets as shoppers returned products for
which the Government said they should receive a refund. The National
Consumer Agency (NCA) said consumers were entitled to be refunded. NCA
chief executive Anne Fitzgerald said: "Under legislation consumers are
entitled to repair, replacement, or refund of a faulty product. In the case
of pork meat or other food products containing pork, consumers are entitled
to a refund as a repair or replacement does not apply in this instance.

The Convenience Stores and Newsagents Association called on the Government
to provide an emergency compensation package so that retailers and
suppliers would not be left out of pocket.

EFSA to provide scientific assistance on dioxins in Irish pig meat
------------------------------------------------------------------
EFSA received a request from the European Commission on 8 Dec 2008 for
urgent scientific and technical assistance following the discovery of
contamination by dioxins in pig meat from 10 farms in Ireland.

The Commission's DG Health and Consumers asked EFSA to provide scientific
assistance on the risks for human health related to the possible presence
of dioxins in pig meat and pig meat products from Ireland and the presence
of possibly contaminated processed pig meat products from Ireland in
composite foods.
EFSA aims to publish its response by Wed 10 Dec 2008.

Shops rush to take Irish pork off shelves
-----------------------------------------
Contaminated Irish pork may have reached markets in as many as 25
countries, it was feared last night [7 Dec 2008], as consumers were warned
not to eat pork products from the island.

Supermarkets and shops were withdrawing all pork products yesterday [7 Dec
2008] that were known to have been made in the Republic or Northern Ireland
since 1 Sep 2008, after dioxins were found in slaughtered pigs thought to
have eaten contaminated feed. Investigations revealed that the suspect feed
had been used in at least 56 farms, including 9 in Northern Ireland.

Just over 8 per cent of Britain's pig meat imports, 51 700 tonnes in the
first 9 months of the year [2008], comes from the Republic of Ireland.

The Food Standards Agency [FSA] admitted that meat from the affected farms
could have found its way into pork products sold in Britain and marked as
made in Britain or the EU. A spokesman said that it would have been
"disproportionate and unacceptable" to tell consumers not to eat these
products.

It is due to hold an emergency meeting in London today [8 Dec 2008] in an
attempt to identify the products at risk. Retailers sought to reassure
consumers, saying that the vast majority of fresh pork, gammon steaks, and
bacon on sale in Britain is thought to be unaffected.

Tesco has checked the origin of all meats in its supermarkets and sells no
fresh Irish pork. Sainsburys said that it did not use Irish pork. Waitrose
said that as a precaution it had withdrawn 2 lines of sausages sold under
the Northern Irish celebrity chef Paul Rankin's brand. In Ireland all pork
products have been withdrawn from shops and consumers were urged to destroy
their supplies at home.

The company under investigation for being the source of the contaminated
feed was named last night [7 Dec 2008] as Millstream Power Recycling, of
Fenagh, County Carlow. A spokesman for the company said officials were
testing oil that had been put in a machine used to dry animal feed.

Paddy Rogan, the Republic's chief veterinary officer, said that
contaminated pig meat may have reached 20 to 25 other countries.

Tests on the slaughtered Irish pigs showed that some pork products
contained up to 200 times more dioxins than the safety limit, although the
food safety expert Professor Hugh Pennington said that the risk to humans
was very low. Dioxins, which are linked to cancer, are a human health risk
only if a person is exposed for 30 to 40 years.

The FSA said: "We do not believe there is significant risk to UK consumers
as adverse health effects from eating the affected products are only likely
if people are exposed to relatively high levels of this contaminant for
long periods." When pressed on whether Northern Irish meat could be on sale
in Britain marked as made in the UK or EU, a spokesman said: "It would be
disproportionate and unacceptable to tell people they should not eat pork,
bacon or ham labelled as produce of the UK and EU."

Alan Reilly, the chief executive of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland,
said that investigations were still under way into how the contamination
got into the animal feed and that culling of animals was likely in order to
remove them from the food chain.

The authority confirmed that a problem pork sample was identified on 19 Nov
2008 during routine testing. It was not until late Saturday [6 Dec 2008]
afternoon that analysis by the Central Science Laboratory in York showed
the precise level of dioxin contamination.

Trevor Sargent, the Irish food minister, said that surplus baking
byproducts were often dried for animal feed. The fuel used should be a
food-grade oil. "We do have our suspicions this time that the oil being
used was not food grade," he said.

Mr Reilly said that the likeliest source of contamination was "industrial
oil or industrial contaminant." Rhodri Evans, FSAI chief toxicology
specialist, said that oil was the most probable cause and that it was
possibly diesel.

A spokesman at the Millstream Power Recycling plant said that the company
had always prided itself on strict quality standards. He added: "Accepting
the need for a recall, Millstream will be carrying out a full investigation
to establish how the company's strict health and safety procedures and the
high quality standards could possibly have been breached."
