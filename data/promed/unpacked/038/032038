An Australian teenager has died after a suspected box jellyfish sting, authorities said Thursday [4 Mar 2021], in a rare case believed to be the country's 1st such death in 15 years.

Health officials said the 17-year-old was stung while swimming at Bamaga, a remote community on the tip of Cape York in Australia's far north, on 22 Feb 2021. He was airlifted to a hospital where he died on 1 Mar 2021, according to police.

The Australian box jellyfish, or _Chironex fleckeri_, is among the world's most venomous creatures. It is found primarily in Australia's tropical northern waters, where swimmers are warned to keep out of the ocean or wear a full-body protective swimsuit during the summer "stinger season."

Marine biologist Lisa-Ann Gershwin said it was Australia's 1st recorded box jellyfish death since 2006. "Unfortunately, the previous fatality also occurred in Bamaga," she told public broadcaster ABC. Gershwin said deaths were avoidable, but people living far from cities were most vulnerable.

"Pain researchers uncover secrets to box jellyfish venom

"Summary: Researchers studying how pain works have discovered an antidote to the deadly sting delivered by the most venomous creature on Earth -- the Australian box jellyfish. A single sting to a human causes necrosis of the skin, excruciating pain and, if the dose of venom is large enough, cardiac arrest and death within minutes. The new antidote, discovered using CRISPR genome editing techniques, blocks the symptoms within 15 minutes after contact.

"The Australian box jellyfish (_Chironex fleckeri_) has about 60 tentacles that can grow up to 3 metres long. Each tentacle has millions of microscopic hooks filled with venom. Each box jellyfish carries enough venom to kill more than 60 humans.

"Associate Professor Greg Neely and Dr. Raymond (Man-Tat) Lau and their team of pain researchers at the Charles Perkins Centre at University of Sydney were studying how the box jellyfish venom works when they made the discovery. They uncovered a medicine that blocks the symptoms of a box jellyfish sting if administered to the skin within 15 minutes after contact.

"The antidote was shown to work on human cells outside the body and then tested effectively on live mice. Researchers now hope to develop a topical application for humans."

The following information about _Chironex fleckeri_ jellyfish has been extracted from https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Chironex_fleckeri/:

"Geographic range: _Chironex fleckeri_, also known as box jellyfish, lives in and around the waters of Australia and Southeast Asia. They inhabit parts of the Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean, and the Great Barrier Reef. Box jellyfish have been found in the waters on the western coast of Australia in the Exmouth Gulf to Gladstone in the northern waters of Australia. Humans are frequently stung by this species in the oceanic waters of Queensland, on Australia's eastern coast. Box jellyfish may also be responsible for stings near the Philippines (Hamner, 1994; Hamner, 1995; Tibballs, 2006).

"Habitat: Box jellyfish tend to inhabit shallow, murky saline waters near Australia. They are mainly found in the ocean but are also found inland in freshwater rivers and mangrove channels when spawning. During heavy storms, they move into deeper waters where the water is calm to avoid damage. Box jellyfish also inhabit shallow rivers during the reproductive season and during their polyp stage. Once young jellyfish mature into medusa, they follow the river out to sea (Currie and Jacups, 2005; Hamner, 1995; Tibballs, 2006).

"Physical description: The name box jellyfish is derived from the shape of their bell, which is box-shaped when healthy. The bell is transparent and is usually between 16 and 24 cm, though some reach a diameter of 35 cm. The tentacles of box jellyfish dangle from pedalia, the corners of the bell. There can be as many as 15 tentacles hanging from each of the 4 pedalia for a total of up to 60 tentacles per jellyfish. Each of the tentacles has a slight blue-gray tint and can grow up 3 m in length. Each tentacle contains millions of nematocysts, which are microscopic hooks where venom is held and delivered. Box jellyfish contain sensory organs including 24 eyes, but they do not have a brain (Carrette et al., 2002; Currie and Jacups, 2005; Hamner, 1995; Seymour et al., 2004; Tibballs, 2006).

"Other physical features: ectothermic, radial symmetry, venomous
"Range mass: up to 2 kg or 4.41 pounds
"Range length: up to 3 meters or 9.84 feet

"Behavior: Box jellyfish have several behavioral traits setting it apart from other jellyfish. Most notably, box jellyfish can actively swim, whereas most species of jellyfish float wherever the current takes them with no control over their direction. Although box jellyfish have the ability to move up to 4 knots, during the day they typically travel at 1 knot or less. Box jellyfish usually swim slower during the day than at night, which is likely due to hunting and consuming of prey. Unlike other jellyfish, box jellyfish rest on the sea floor, not moving unless disturbed. Box jellyfish may require this rest phase to energetically compensate for the time they spend actively swimming. Box jellyfish also display this type of behavior when seas are rough, during which they sink to the sea floor until the water calms. Box jellyfish also unintentionally sting humans. The sting of a box jellyfish can be fatal to humans and has accounted for more than 60 deaths in the last 100 years. Most fatalities are documented in children and young adults (Gordon and Seymour, 2009; Hamner, 1994; Hamner, 1995; Hartwick, 1991; Seymour and Sutherland, 2001; Tibballs, 2006).

"Communication and perception: Because box jellyfish have no brain, it is difficult to define their communication and perception. Box jellyfish do have eyes, which have photoreceptors. Photoreceptors give box jellyfish the ability to detect light from dark, but it is uncertain whether this species can process shapes and figures. Box jellyfish, however, are attracted to light and tend to avoid darker shapes. Box jellyfish can also detect vibrations, which is thought to be useful for finding prey and avoiding predators. Currently, little is known regarding methods of communication between jellyfish. If box jellyfish do communicate with one another, it is most likely through chemical signals (Coates, 2003; Hamner, 1994; Hamner, 1995).

"The study of box jellyfish venom has led to a successful anti-venom agent, which can save human lives if administered quickly. Additionally, while this research is still in its infancy, scientists hope to better understand why jellyfish venom is so harmful to the human cardiovascular system. Once determined, this information can hopefully be used to design more effective medicine for other cardiovascular problems (Hodgson and Isbister, 2009; Seymour and Sutherland, 2001; Tibballs, 2006; Winter et al., 2009).

"Box jellyfish are believed to be the most venomous creatures in the world. Their stings are extremely deadly to human beings and have caused over 60 deaths in the last century. The amount of venom injected into humans by box jellies influences the certainty of death. It is estimated that if a total of 6 m of tentacles comes into contact with human skin -- and therefore all nematocysts on those tentacles "fire" -- the amount of venom injected is sufficient to cause death in just a few minutes. Shortly after a human is stung, they typically encounter symptoms such as extreme pain, shortness of breath, and purple welts. Some victims may also become irrational and suffer cardiac arrest. All of these symptoms typically commence within 5 minutes of being stung and can last up to 2 weeks before subsiding. Although box jellyfish are fully capable of killing adult humans, most fatalities are documented in children and young adults. To reduce fatalities, box jellyfish nets have been constructed on many beaches where box jellyfish stings are known to occur. Despite these nets, there are still reports of stings every year (Coates, 2003; Hamner, 1994; Hamner, 1995; Seymour and Sutherland, 2001; Tibballs, 2006)."
