["Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is a viral disease affecting only members of the equidae family (horses, ponies, zebras, mules, and donkeys).

"There is no vaccine or treatment for the disease. Infection is often in-apparent and results in a lifelong carrier state if the horse survives the acute phase of the infection. Because infected animals become lifelong carriers, they must be permanently isolated and quarantined or euthanized.

"EIA is found widely throughout the world. There is no evidence that EIA is a threat to human health." (https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/horse-disease-information/eia/equine-infectious-anemia). - Mod.CRD
