Officials at Clemson Livestock Poultry Health (CLPH), in Columbia, South Carolina, have confirmed eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in a 4 year old thoroughbred stallion in Beaufort County. The horse, whose vaccination status is unknown, is deceased. This is South Carolina's 5th case of EEE in 2019, and Beaufort County's 2nd.

Eastern equine encephalomyelitis is caused by the eastern equine encephalitis virus, for which wild birds are a natural reservoir. Mosquitoes that feed on EEE-infected birds can transmit the virus to humans, horses, and other birds. Horses do not develop high enough levels of these viruses in their blood to be contagious to other animals or humans. Because of the high mortality rate in horses and humans, EEE is regarded as one of the most serious mosquitoborne diseases in the United States.

Tips for preventing mosquito-borne diseases include:
- avoid mosquito bites: use insect repellent when outdoors, especially from dusk to dawn;
- look for EPA-labeled products containing active ingredients such as DEET, picaridin (KBR3023), or oil of lemon eucalyptus (p-menthane 3,8-diol);
- apply more repellent, according to label instructions, if mosquitoes start to bite;
- mosquito-proof homes: fix or install window and door screens, and cover or eliminate empty containers with standing water where mosquitoes can lay eggs;
- protect your horses: veterinarians recommend commercially available licensed vaccines against EEE for all horses in the US. Horses should be vaccinated at least annually (recommendations vary in high-risk areas); it's not too late this year to vaccinate your horses;
- use approved insect repellents to protect horses;
- if possible, put horses in stables, stalls, or barns during the prime mosquito exposure hours of dusk and dawn;
- eliminate standing water, drain water troughs, and empty buckets at least weekly;
- stock water tanks with fish that consume mosquito larvae (contact your local mosquito control for assistance) or use mosquito "dunks" (solid "donuts" of_ Bacillus thuringiensis_ israelensis [BTi], which are non-toxic to horses) available at hardware stores.

A mosquitoborne virus that can be deadly to humans was confirmed in Beaufort County after a horse died this month [November 2019]. A horse found dead 8 Nov 2019 on St Helena Island tested positive last week [week of 11 Nov 2019] for eastern equine encephalitis -- or triple E [EEE] -- a disease caused by a virus carried by mosquitoes which can be contracted by humans, Beaufort County Animal Services director Tallulah Trice said. The case is the 4th found in an animal in South Carolina this year [2019] and the 1st in Beaufort County according to the State Veterinarian Office. The state office confirmed [on Mon 11 Nov 2019] that a 5 year old gelding that had died in Beaufort County had tested positive.

Beaufort County Mosquito Control sprayed the area from an airplane the morning the horse was found dead, director Gregg Hunt said. The agency also set mosquito traps on the property, Hunt said, but they netted a low number of the insects, and none carried the virus. "If there's any indication (of a mosquitoborne virus), we move very quickly in response," Hunt said.

The disease is rare in humans, with fewer than 160 cases in the United States during the past 35 years and about 5 to 10 cases reported in humans each year, according to state and federal agencies. No human cases were reported in South Carolina from 2009 to 2018, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] show.

Vaccinating to protect other horses
-----------------------------------
County animal control officials received a call about an ill horse on St Helena Island on 7 Nov 2019. The horse was treated and given fluids and able to stand back up, Trice said. But another call came the next day: the horse was found dead. The infected animal was near Little Horse Island, where a population of 7 wild ponies lives.

Trice said she is working with veterinarian Dessie Carter and the ponies' caretaker to develop a plan to vaccinate the ponies and other horses nearby against the disease. Venaye McGlashan, the St Helena resident who looks after the ponies, is a retired large animal veterinarian and former director of the State Veterinary Office. She said the animals are fairly isolated on their island and have been safe from other cases of disease. Because of how close the infected horse was found, McGlashan said she and others would likely try to vaccinate the ponies soon.

The process, which may involve using a mobile corral, risks traumatizing animals unaccustomed to human interaction, McGlashan said. She said protecting the remaining ponies from the deadly disease would likely be worth the effort.

Horse owners are typically advised to vaccinate their animals twice a year but should consult their veterinarian, said Mike Martin, associate state veterinarian who deals with epidemiology. "It's a case we hate to see because it's almost totally preventable by vaccination," she [sic] said.

Mosquitoes are carriers
-----------------------
Mosquitoes contract the virus from certain birds and can pass it to other animals and people. Horses, some game birds and, more rarely, humans can develop serious disease from the virus. Anyone in the area where the virus is circulating is at risk of being infected by a mosquito, according to CDC. Those who live in woodland areas or work or play outside where they might be bitten by a mosquito are most at risk, the agency says.

Symptoms in humans can include brain swelling, fever, headaches, confusion, vomiting, and seizures. Anyone experiencing severe headaches, high fever, muscle weakness, or confusion should see a doctor immediately, according to state health officials. There is no human vaccine for the disease, and about a third of cases in humans are fatal, with many of those surviving suffering long-term mild- to severe brain damage.

"In the United States, equine encephalitides for which vaccines are available include eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE), western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE), Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE), and West Nile Virus encephalomyelitis. The distribution of EEE has historically been restricted to the eastern, south eastern, and some southern states (but disease incidence is also reported in the upper mid-western states of Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin). Outbreaks of WEE have been recorded in the western and mid-western states. Variants of WEE have caused sporadic cases in the north east and south east, most notably Florida. VEE occurs in South and Central America but has not been diagnosed in the United States for more than 40 years. The availability of licensed vaccine products combined with an inability to completely eliminate risk of exposure justifies immunization against EEE and WEE as core prophylaxis for all horses residing in or traveling to North America and any other geographic areas where EEE and/or WEE is endemic.

"Transmission of EEE/WEE/VEE is by mosquitoes, and infrequently by other bloodsucking insects, to horses from wild birds or rodents, which serve as natural reservoirs for these viruses. Human beings are also susceptible to these diseases when the virus is transmitted to them by infected mosquitoes; however, horse-to-horse or horse-to-human transmission by mosquitoes is highly unlikely, because the level and duration of viremia is insufficient to infect mosquitoes that might feed on a horse affected with EEE or WEE. On the other hand, the viremia that occurs in horses infected with VEE virus subtypes 1AB and 1C is much higher. Direct horse-to-horse or horse-to-human transmission of VEE is possible. Of these 3 encephalomyelitides, WEE has the lowest mortality (about 50 per cent). Eastern equine encephalomyelitis is the most virulent for horses, with mortality approaching 90 per cent. Epidemiological evidence indicates that young horses are particularly susceptible to disease caused by EEE virus. Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis caused by subtypes 1AB and 1C can give rise to mortality rates ranging from 20 to 80 per cent; however, some horses develop subclinical infection that results in lasting immunity.

"The risk of exposure and geographic distribution of EEE and WEE vary from year-to-year with changes in distribution of insect vectors and reservoirs important in the natural ecology of the virus. EEE activity in mosquitoes and birds, and resultant disease in humans and equids, continues to cause concern along the East Coast and demonstrates northward encroachment. WEE has caused minimal disease in horses in the last 2 decades; however, the virus continues to be detected in mosquitoes and birds throughout the Western states. In addition, variants that cause clinical disease in equids have been detected in the eastern US.

"VEE is a reportable foreign animal disease. Epidemics of VEE occur when the virus undergoes genetic change and develops greater virulence for humans and equid species. Viral variants, which belong to subtypes 1AB and 1C, are able to multiply to high levels in the horse which serves as a amplifying host of the virus in these outbreaks. Strains of subtype 1E have also been shown to cause morbidity and mortality in horses but on a much lesser scale. Areas of southern Texas, California, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and the west coast of Florida are likely at the most risk for natural VEE encroachment from Central and South America.

"Vaccination against VEE is controversial because:
1. Vaccination against a foreign animal disease may confound testing in the event of an outbreak. However, vaccination against EEE/WEE will also result in cross-reaction to VEE virus in certain serologic tests.
2. Experimental and field data have demonstrated that previous infection with either EEE or WEE may provide cross protection against VEE. It is therefore possible that EEE/WEE bivalent vaccination may provide partial cross-protection, although it is likely to be less than that following infection.
3. A conditionally available modified live (MLV) VEE vaccine has been released during previous outbreaks and provides superior protection against the disease and high titered viremias. Should an outbreak occur, it is likely that this highly attenuated MLV would be released for restricted use subject to certain conditions being met.

"In summary, horses that receive annual EEE/WEE vaccines may be partially protected against VEE infection. In the event of an outbreak, the availability of and vaccination with the highly effective MLV product would induce rapid, complete immunity while allowing for accurate surveillance before VEE specific vaccination. The use of killed VEE vaccine should be performed only in high-risk areas of the US, at the discretion of the attending veterinarian, or when necessary, with input from state agriculture officials. The use of the inactivated VEE vaccine is less effective than the MLV VEE vaccine, and will reduce immune responses to the MLV VEE vaccine.

"Vaccines
---------
EEE/WEE vaccines currently available are formalin inactivated adjuvanted whole virus products. Early testing of bivalent (EEE/WEE) vaccines was performed by intracranial challenge with either EEE and WEE; the formalin inactivated preparations were shown to be highly efficacious in protecting against clinical disease.

Currently, the only available VEE vaccines are killed products; an MLV would likely be conditionally released in the face of an outbreak.

"Vaccination schedules EEE/WEE
------------------------------
- Adult horses previously vaccinated against EEE/WEE: annual revaccination must be completed prior to vector season in the spring. In animals of high risk or with limited immunity, more frequent vaccination or appropriately timed vaccination is recommended in order to induce protective immunity during periods of likely exposure. In areas where mosquitoes are active year-round, many veterinarians elect to vaccinate horses at 4- to 6-month intervals to ensure uniform protection throughout the year, although this practice is not specifically recommended by manufacturers of vaccines.
- Adult horses, previously unvaccinated against EEE/WEE or of unknown vaccinal history: administer a primary series of 2 doses with a 4- to 6-week interval between doses. Revaccinate prior to the onset of the next vector season and annually thereafter.
- Pregnant mares, previously vaccinated against EEE/WEE: vaccinate 4 to 6 weeks before foaling.
- Pregnant mares, unvaccinated or having unknown vaccinal history: immediately begin a 2-dose primary series with a 4-week interval between doses. Booster at 4 to 6 weeks before foaling or prior to the onset of the next vector season -- whichever occurs first.
- Foals of mares vaccinated against EEE/WEE in the pre-partum period: administer a primary 3-dose series beginning at 4 to 6 months of age. A 4- to 6-week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses is recommended. The 3rd dose should be administered at 10 to 12 months of age prior to the onset of the next mosquito season.
In the south eastern US, due to earlier seasonal disease risk, vaccination may be started at 2 to 3 months of age. When initiating vaccinations in younger foals, a series of 4 primary doses should be administered, with a 4-week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses and between the 2nd and 3rd doses. The 4th dose should be administered at 10 to 12 months of age prior to the onset of the next mosquito season.
- Foals of unvaccinated mares or having unknown vaccinal history: administer a primary series of 3 doses with a 4-week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses and an 8-week interval between the 2nd and 3rd doses. If the primary series is initiated during the mosquito vector season, an interval of 3 to 4 weeks between the 2nd and 3rd doses is preferable to the interval of 8 weeks described above.
NOTE: Foals in the south eastern USA: the primary vaccination series should be initiated at 3 months of age due to early seasonal vector presence.
- Horses having been naturally infected and recovered: recovered horses likely develop lifelong immunity. Consider revaccination only if the immune status of the animal changes the risk of susceptibility to infection. Examples of these conditions would include the long-term use of corticosteroids and equine pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID)."
