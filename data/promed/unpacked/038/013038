Litigation was filed in Lyman County, South Dakota, last week after a product from a Nebraska company allegedly made 1000 head of cattle sick and killed more than 40. According to court documents, Presho Livestock, LLC, purchased a feed product from Norfolk, Nebraska-based Battle Creek/CHS, LLC, on 10 Nov 2016.

The product, known as Rumensin, was a supplement intended to allow cattle to get more energy from their food and to control coccidiosis, an intestinal disease. The product is available in a liquid form that can be added to feed.

The livestock company alleges in the complaint it fed the cows the recommended ratio of Rumensin to feed, but of its approximately 1000 head of cattle given Rumensin, all of them became sick, and more than 40 died, with clinical signs starting around 36 hours after consuming the Rumensin. According to the complaint, necropsies were done on 10 of the dead cows. They showed severe pulmonary edema (fluid accumulation in the lungs) and myocardial necrosis (dead heart tissue).

The complaint states Battle Creek/CHS was negligent in either manufacturing the Rumensin or properly advising consumers on how to use the product, and it was negligent in its failure to warn of possible damage that could occur if the product separates or is otherwise compromised.

Although the exact amount of Presho Livestock's damages has not yet been determined, the complaint states that it is not more than USD 74 999.

[This article does not tell us if these are beef or dairy cattle. However, in looking up Presho Livestock, LLC http://presholivestock.com/, it appears that, in addition to the livestock auction business, there is a beef cattle raising operation. There are feed labels for Rumensin for beef cattle and another for dairy animals. So presumably they were using the label for beef cattle. We do not know if these are stocker animals, reproducing cows, or calves. The label amounts are a bit different, and the warnings indicate these medicated feeds are not to be self-fed or free-choice. This article gives us little information into which type of animal is being fed or how they are being fed.

In the USA, generally monensin has the trade name Rumensin (manufactured by Elanco Animal Health) and is a feed additive for cattle labeled for "improved feed efficiency, for increased rate of weight gain, and for the prevention and control of coccidiosis caused by _Eimeria bovis_ and _Eimeria zuernii_."

In cattle, the mechanism of action of the ionophore monensin is to decrease the proportions of acetic and butyric volatile fatty acids in the rumen and to increase propionic acid production, the most efficiently utilized of the ruminal fatty acids. It selectively kills bacteria-producing methane, resulting in less carbon loss and greater energy efficiency. Monensin reduces the ruminal degradation of protein, which results in improved protein utilization.

In cattle, the clinical signs of acute monensin toxicity are:
- Loss of appetite, reduced feed intake or completely off feed (24 to 36 hours after consuming a high dose)
- Diarrhea, signs of abdominal pain
- Dullness, lethargy, depression
- Weakness, ataxia, incoordination, loss of balance, stumbling, muscular stiffness
- Difficult, rapid, and/or labored breathing
- Recumbency (down) and death usually within 3 to 14 days of the ingestion of the contaminated feed

Ionophore toxicity will usually involve a recent change in feed supplementation and will generally involve more than one animal with clinical signs.

Cattle that recover from the initial poisoning event may die suddenly from heart failure if exercised or stressed. Later development of congestive heart failure can occur as a consequence to an earlier poisoning. With heart failure, cases may look very similar to pneumonia with difficult labored breathing due to fluid buildup in and around the lungs. Deaths can occur for extended periods after exposure has stopped depending on the severity of the permanent heart damage https://www.drovers.com/article/be-aware-when-feeding-cattle-ionophores-overdose-may-prove-deadly.

Cattle that die from ionophore overdoses normally have evidence of heart failure, but it is not uncommon for nothing to be found in an animal that dies very quickly. In the diagnostic lab, typical findings at necropsy associated with monensin toxicosis in cattle are cardiac (heart) and skeletal muscle degeneration that look like pale or yellow areas in the muscle and secondary problems of fluid buildup in and around the lungs (pulmonary edema) due to the inability of the damaged heart to pump adequately. In addition to examination of a dead animal, samples of the suspected diet must be analyzed as well https://www.drovers.com/article/be-aware-when-feeding-cattle-ionophores-overdose-may-prove-deadly.

At this point one has to wonder if they had the feed assayed to know how much Rumensin was in the feed. Or if they were feeding a type B feed (having more monensin) than a type C feed. Unfortunately, mixing errors can occur, as do communication errors and understanding exactly what the customer is wanting with regard to the feed.

The article tells us Rumensin is available in a liquid form to added to feed. So without further information it is not possible to know if the person feeding the animals made the feed mixing error or the mill itself made the error. Most feed mixing errors are human error, not the result of the ionophore itself. - Mod.TG
