Republic of Congo: Monkeypox Outbreak in Impfondo - Update
----------------------------------------------------------
A delegation from Congo's Ministry of Health & Ministry of Water and
Forests, left Impfondo today after spending 10 days in the region. They did
a lot of research, visited the sites, interviewed and examined patients,
took more samples, and sent them to a lab in South Africa. They also
transported the greater white-nose monkey that was kept as a pet at the
index patient's house for testing in Brazzaville and/or South Africa.
Radio spots have been aired, and the population is starting to realize some
of the dangers of keeping/hunting/eating monkeys. There does seem to be
some increased awareness in the general population. Barrier precautions at
the government hospital are still not ideal, but are somewhat improved.
There have not been any new cases since last Tuesday [1 Jul 2003], but we
have located more young people with healed lesions. There does seem to be
a new outbreak of varicella [chickenpox - a herpesvirus infection - Mod.CP]
though. Unfortunately the varicella patients were hospitalized in the same
room with the last monkeypox patient.
We would still like some smallpox vaccine if possible.

2 More Cases of Suspected Monkeypox
-------------------------------------
2 new suspected monkeypox patients just presented to church's clinic. The
first is a 5-year-old boy with fever, lymphadenopathy, sore throat, and a
cough, with vesicular lesions. The second is his 2-year-old sister, who 2
weeks ago developed a similar eruption and illness. They live in the same
neighborhood as the government hospital. It's not clear yet whether they
had any contact with previous patients or exotic animals.
