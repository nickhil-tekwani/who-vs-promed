An 11-year-old girl who lived in Arroyo Seco died of cardiovascular failure in the Children's Hospital, north zone, in Rosario. After several studies in emergency centers, it was stated that her death was due to an infection with Argentine hemorrhagic fever [virus]. According to her mother, health post SAMCO No. 50 in Arroyo Seco sent her to another health assistance center when the girl spiked a fever of 40 C [104 F]. They were unable to provide an ambulance, so she was taken to Rosario on a motorcycle. In the city, she presented with another clinical picture more similar to pneumonia and far from the diagnosis that took her life.

[Argentine hemorrhagic fever is caused by infection with Junin virus, an arenavirus. It occurs sporadically in the endemic area of Santa Fe province.

The circumstances under which the girl acquired her infection are not stated, but may be due to contact with rodent hosts. The hosts of Junin virus are rodents, particularly _Mus musculus_, _Calomys spp_. and _Akodon azarae_. The animals have a chronic, asymptomatic infection and shed virus through saliva, urine, and blood. Human infections occur through contact with skin, mucosa, and inhalation of aerosolized particles carrying the virus.

According to the GIDEON database, most cases of this vaccine-preventable disease occur in Cordoba, Buenos Aires, and Santa Fe provinces, and the peak year was 1964 with over 3000 cases, with 120 cases in each of 1993 and 1994. Prevention of human cases is the same as for hantaviruses: avoidance of activities that result in contact with aerosols in areas where the rodent hosts are present. - Mod.TY
