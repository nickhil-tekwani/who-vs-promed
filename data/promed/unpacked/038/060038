[1] Comment: mosquito larvicide _Bacillus thuringiensis_, var. _israelensis_

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Regarding today's [9 Aug 2017] story about the chikungunya outbreak in an arid region of Pakistan that has suddenly received a lot of rainfall, it was stated that "they could not control the large numbers of mosquito larvae in water collection tanks because cattle need to drink that water." However the mosquito larvicide products based on _Bacillus thuringiensis_, var. _israelensis_ (aka, BTI), can be effectively used in livestock water tanks, bird baths, and other bodies of water used by animals for drinking without causing any harm to the animals that drink that water. In fact, water treated with BTI should pose no problem to people who drink it either, unless the water has other pathogens in it. BTI is only toxic to the larvae of mosquitoes and other primitive fly species of that live by filter-feeding in aquatic environments.

[2] EpiCore response

[In response to the request for information, the following contribution was received from an EpiCore member]

Each of the provinces in country has its own practices regarding vector control. Narrating specifically about Punjab, the highest populated with relatively better infrastructure, the mosquito control measures were first strengthened following 2009-10 multi-district fatal outbreaks of dengue hemorrhagic fever. Special surveillance for _Aedes_ larvae is being conducted on largest scale in Punjab. House-to-house surveying for indoor and outdoor larvae detection has yielded substantial biological evidence over last 6-7 years with resultant seasonal pattern identification.

Legislation and law enforcement regarding epidemic prevention and control has also yielded good results. This active surveillance has contributed much toward control of _Aedes_ mosquito and hence the dengue virus and chikungunya virus transmission, despite highest mass transit from all endemic and outbreak foci. In Punjab, only 3 cases of chikungunya have been confirmed in 2017. These are not epi-linked and sporadic in occurrence over wide geographical area. 2 of these have traveled with infection from Sindh Province. 1 case has acquired infection in Punjab.

Larvae detection is always high in the monsoon season. Surveillance activities in the field are android enabled and transformed onto an electronic dashboard for daily progress monitoring of real time geo-tagging of detected larvae. Hence, it can be projected that Punjab is least likely to be involved in any bigger outbreaks of chikungunya virus with such strict control measures. If control measures are haltered, the vector is present and may start transmitting viruses at a greater pace.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Gaines and Dr Siddiqui for their insightful comments and hopes that public health and vector control authorities in Pakistan will be able to deliberate further on this matter and incorporate similar larvicidal agents in their control strategies, if they are not being used currently.

Any updates from EpiCore members in the region on the current vector control practices in use in Pakistan would be appreciated. - Mod.UBA
