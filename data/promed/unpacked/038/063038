[I fear I may have spoken too soon when I mentioned that transmission of MERS-CoV might be slowing down. In the past 48 hours since the last ProMED-mail update there have been 2 newly confirmed cases reported, both classified as primary cases, one with no history of exposure to camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness, the other still under investigation. In previous years, after a slow late summer for transmission, there were increases in reported cases in early autumn, which might well be what is being observed. As long as these remain sporadic cases without leading to nosocomial outbreaks, the situation should remain in relative control.

A map showing the locations of the newly confirmed cases and recovery can be found at the source URL. The HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia can be found at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=4511887,131. - Mod.MPP]
