Local veterinarians confirmed at least 14 cases of leishmaniasis, which affects humans and their pets and may also lead to severe complications.

Concordia Veterinary College, in Entre Rios province, found in this northeastern city 14 cases of leishmaniasis, a serious condition that affects humans and their pets and it is transmitted by a small blood-eating mosquito (sandfly).

The organization explained in a statement that leishmaniasis encompasses some zoonotic and human diseases caused by microorganisms from the _Leishmania_ genus, ranging from skin ulcers to lethal forms with severe liver and spleen inflammation.

The veterinarians also stated in their document that they are "deeply concerned with the number of leishmaniasis cases being reported" in Concordia. "These cases have been confirmed in private laboratories and in other centers that work together with the municipality."

"We do know that the vector is currently living in our area, so the disease has become endemic and it will be difficult to eradicate", the professionals warned.

The Concordia Section of the Entre Rios Veterinary College pointed out that the disease is caused by a parasite that enters the bloodstream (_Leishmania_ sp.) through the bite of a sandfly called _Lutzomiya longipalpis_, also known by the following local names: 'plumilla', 'torito', or 'carachai' (in Peru, the bug is called 'titira').

This vector, after biting infected animals, transmits the disease to other animals, and eventually to humans, "so it is a severe zoonosis."

"It is harmful to deny this fact, and we consider that information is vital as the only valid tool for being able to manage these situations," the professionals added.

Some recommendations the entity issued include eliminating withered leaves and every material that might be a breeding site for the vector, using mosquito nets in every door and window, having dogs and cats sleep in enclosed places, and using repellent collars or topical repellent that comes in small tubes.

The veterinary college also warned that there is no therapy for infected animals; they carry the disease throughout their life, and it is preferable to euthanise infected animals. They also recommended not to touch dogs from places where the disease has been reported; and that hen houses must be kept in the cleanest possible condition, since such places are likely breeding sites for vectors.

[In the absence of specific information on the actual species of the stated cases, we presume that the diseases companion animals referred to are all dogs.

This is a very serious disease for the person or animal infected.

_Leishmania infantum_ is the most common and important cause of canine leishmaniasis worldwide. Although referred to as canine leishmaniasis in most of the world, many in North America still use the historic form leishmaniasis; the Companion Animal Parasite Council (CAPC) considers the 2 terms synonymous. Other Leishmania spp. reported from dogs include _L. Mexicana_, _L. donovani_, and _L. _braziliensis_. _Leishmania_ spp. are also occasionally reported from cats. In areas where these parasites are endemic, cats are at risk of infection.

The life cycle of _Leishmania_ spp. involves 2 hosts: a vertebrate (including rodents, canids, or humans) and an insect (sand fly). In regions where these infections are endemic, phlebotomine sand flies (genus _Lutzomyia_ in the New World) are the vectors for transmission.

Infection does not invariably lead to illness. In fact, most infected dogs remain asymptomatic and may never develop clinical manifestations. In endemic regions, the prevalence of disease is often less than 10 percent, and only about 1 in 5 infected dogs are considered likely to develop clinical disease.

The variable course of disease that occurs following infection is thought to be due to differences in the immune response of individual dogs. Certain breeds (e.g., German shepherd, Boxers, Cocker spaniels) are considered more likely to develop disease. In the United States, leishmaniasis is considered endemic in many foxhound kennels and is most commonly identified in this breed.

Disease is most commonly seen in dogs less than 3 years of age and older than 8, and may be associated with other immunocompromising conditions; some studies have shown that disease is more common in male dogs, although this is not a consistent finding.

Skin lesions are the most common sign associated with clinical leishmaniasis in endemic areas and may include regional (often facial) alopecia and non-pruritic, ulcerative, nodular, or papular dermatitis that may or may not be complicated by bacterial pyoderma.

Other clinical manifestations include chronic wasting, epistaxis, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, ocular signs (anterior uveitis, retinitis), severe muscle atrophy, swollen limbs and joints, lameness, lymphadenopathy, polyarthritis, and protein-losing nephropathy, which may lead to renal failure. Assessment of renal function in all infected dogs is critically important.

Anemia, thrombocytopenia, lymphocytosis, hypoalbuminemia, hyperglobulinemia, hyperamylasemia, and azotemia are the most frequently detected laboratory abnormalities.

Diagnosis of canine leishmaniasis is based on the presence of clinical signs together with positive specific antibody assay. Infection can be confirmed by demonstration of the parasites (amastigotes) on touch prep stained (Wright-Giemsa) slides or in cultures of tissue aspirates or biopsy specimens of the spleen, liver, bone marrow, or lymph nodes.

Diagnostic antibody tests include the indirect fluorescent antibody assay (IFA), direct agglutination assay, and enzyme immunoassay (EIA). These tests vary in sensitivity and specificity, and although they verify presence of antibody, they do not prove or rule out active infection.

These assays may give false-positive reactions with sera of dogs imported from endemic areas that have been vaccinated against Leishmania spp. and in dogs infected by _Trypanosoma cruzi_, another protozoan that sometimes infects dogs in the Americas. However, the rK39 dipstick immunoassay does not cross-react with _T. cruzi_ or Babesia.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays are available at some veterinary diagnostic laboratories and can be helpful for confirming infection in individual patients and as part of an overall control program.

Renal function should be carefully evaluated on all infected dogs; persistent renal proteinuria and non-regenerative anemia should raise the index of suspicion for canine leishmaniasis in any at risk dog.

Canine leishmaniasis is less amenable to treatment than this infection is in humans. Anti-leishmanial drugs used in dogs include pentavalent antimonials and allopurinol; to date, no drug has proven to be consistently curative for visceral leishmaniasis in dogs.

Care should be taken when using human drugs to treat dogs in endemic areas due to the risk of selection for resistance.

Antimonial compounds can suppress and sometimes cure the infection; such compounds include meglumine antimonate (Glucantime) in Europe and sodium stibogluconate (Pentostam) in the United States. Although clinical improvement may occur in response to chemotherapy, relapses are common, and chemotherapeutic elimination of _L. infantum_ has not been consistently achieved with any drug tested to date.

Maintenance therapy with allopurinol (10 mg/kg) decreases parasitemia, maintains infected dogs in an asymptomatic state, and decreases the likelihood of direct or vector transmission.

In areas where _L. infantum_ is endemic and transmitted by insect vectors, it is an important agent of human disease and dogs are considered the most important peridomestic reservoir host. However, ownership of an infected dog has not been shown to increase the risk of infection in the family.

The practice of eliminating seropositive dogs (euthanasia program) is occasionally practiced but is not considered effective at reducing the rate of human or canine infection in a given area.

If sand flies in North America are able to transmit _L. infantum_ from infected to susceptible dogs, then vector transmission from infected dogs to humans is also possible.
