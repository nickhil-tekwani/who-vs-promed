------------------------------------------------------------
In context with this report and the actions planned I assume 3 points could be of special interest:
1. Since the WHO started to promote life-long immunity after a single YF shot, I wonder whether official bodies in Angola trust in this recommendation (or re-vaccinate after 10-20-30 years?)?
2. Pregnant women are addressed as a specific risk group and will predominantly be vaccinated (in contrast to the policy in travel medicine where this is a (or at least relative) contraindication.
3. Due to the prevalence in mass vaccination campaigns in this region it is likely that HIV positive (even in the status of AIDS) will be vaccinated.

So this would be a good opportunity to check for
a) breakthroughs in 1.
b) problems/adverse reactions in 2. and 3.

A final question: will there be surveillance (and a standardized reporting protocol) focused on a) and b)?

[Dr Haditsch raises some interesting points and questions about yellow fever (YF) vaccination of specific cohorts in the Angola population. Although the Angola Ministry of Health is awaiting final laboratory confirmation before initiating a vaccination effort, the YF diagnosis is likely correct. And, as Mod.JW indicated, vaccination should be initiated immediately so that the outbreak does not spread, recognizing that YF vaccine needs 10 days to take effect so that vaccination should be carried out in the area while waiting for confirmation from Dakar. One hopes that post vaccination follow up of the cohorts that Dr Haditsch mentions will provide answers to his questions.

ProMED-mail reiterates its request for information regarding whether these are cases have been confirmed as YF and whether they involve the urban cycle of transmission. ProMED-mail is keen to know where and when the YF virus infections occurred, the age and sex of the cases, and details of the YF vaccination campaign planned.
