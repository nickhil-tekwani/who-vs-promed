Subject: Emergency Management Warning 51: Exotic Newcastle Disease
Confirmed in the United States
All information in the following Notice marked with an asterisk (*)
identifies changes since the last Notice was sent out.
Exotic Newcastle disease (END) was confirmed on 1 Oct 2002, in the
State of California, and has now spread beyond backyard flocks to
affect 17 commercial operations in California. On 16 Jan 2003, END
was also confirmed in a backyard flock in the State of Nevada. A
backyard flock was confirmed with END on 4 Feb 2003, in the State of
Arizona.
Clinical signs in infected birds include respiratory, nervous, and
gastrointestinal signs. Mortality is up to 90 percent of exposed
birds. Investigations are ongoing and all figures are pending final
validation. Veterinary Services is exploring all options to send
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) personnel, other
federal government personnel, and is working with the States to
consider additional resources to meet the labor demands. APHIS has
developed a plan for nation END surveillance. This plan will enhance
the already extensive surveillance underway.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has declared an
extraordinary emergency for the States of Arizona, California, and
Nevada. These declarations allow USDA to apply federal authority
within Arizona, California and Nevada.
Currently there are 17 commercial flocks in the State of California
affected by END. The breakdown of the commercial premises involved
is as follows: 4 premises in Riverside County (3 infected and 1
contact), 5 counties in San Diego County (5 infected), and 8 premises
in San Bernardino County (8 infected).
* Of the 2367 premises designated for depopulation, 86.8 percent have
been completed.
* Today, in conjunction with the outreach efforts of the Central
California Command post, Stanislaus County personnel will begin END
surveillance efforts. This cooperative approach was finalized in an
agreement signed by Task Force and County officials last week.
Similar agreements with approximately 15 other counties in that
region should soon follow.
* The California Department of Fish and Game is in the process of
providing educational material about END to State hunting license
vendors for distribution in their establishments. The Department is
also hosting a Turkey Hunting Expo this weekend and plans to
distribute information about the disease to attendees. Additionally,
on 8 Mar 2003, the officials from the Department will be distributing
END information to participants attending a wildlife rehabilitation
seminar in Santa Barbara. A representative from the Department
serves as an Agency Representative to Area Command.
The Central Valley Incident Command Post in Modesto, CA, is staffed
and working cooperatively with approximately 15 ) 20 county officials
to implement efficient surveillance measures throughout the Central
Valley.
The Agriculture Multi-Agency Coordination (AgMAC) Group met on 26 Feb
2003, to discuss the END situation, resource availability, State
personnel legislation, and future personnel needs. The AgMAC is
scheduled to have a follow-up meeting 5 Feb 2003, and will meet
weekly to address issues as they emerge.
3 Veterinarians from the Mexican State of Baja California arrived for
duty with the Task Force. The veterinarians are part of an 8-member
volunteer unit, ad they will be stationed at the Inland Desert
Incident Command Post (ICP).
An expert panel on poultry diseases visited the Inland Desert ICP,
the South Coast ICP, and the San Bernardino laboratory locations to
discuss testing, permitting, risk assessment, and industry
relationships. Members of the group include representatives from the
Agriculture Research Service, University of Pennsylvania School of
Veterinary Medicine, Ohio State University, and the University of
California at Davis.
Task Force personnel, in close collaboration with the California
State Highway Patrol, have agreed to establish an inspection station
at the commercial truck weighing station on Interstate 5 at Castaic.
Personnel will perform visual inspections of commercial vehicles that
contain birds or poultry. Further, California State Highway Patrol
officers will remain alert for commercial poultry vehicles they see
in and around quarantine zones and those officers will notify the
Task Force with any information pertinent to the Task Force mission.
The Public Information Office plans to issue a press release
regarding the Castaic inspection station.
Outreach Activities
* This week, Task Force personnel from the Las Vegas Incident Command
Post met with officials from the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in Las
Vegas. Chamber of Commerce officials plan to assist the Task Force
mission by distributing END educational materials at Hispanic grocery
stores.
* Task Force personnel at the South Coast Incident Command Post have
begun distributing END educational materials in the utility bills of
residents who live in areas highly affected by the virus.
* On a daily basis, Task Force public information personnel are
communicating information concerning surveillance, depopulation, and
cleaning and disinfection operations to all affected city managers in
Southern California.
* Currently, Task Force information personnel field approximately 450
calls per week from the public through the Joint Information Center
phone bank. This is a 20-fold increase from the number of calls from
early October 2002. On average, approximately 300 of these calls
require follow-up action by the Inland Desert or South Coast Incident
Command Posts.
