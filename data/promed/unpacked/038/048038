Malaria in the United Republic of Tanzania.

Following reports of a disease outbreak in Sumbawanga District, in the
south-eastern part of the country, the Regional Health Authority sent an
investigating team to the affected areas - Matai, Sopa and Katete wards.
It has been confirmed that the outbreak was caused by a severe form of
falciparum malaria. The whole country is experiencing increased numbers of
malaria cases and deaths following an abnormally long rainy season.
Similar outbreaks have been reported in several other districts
(Tanga, Muleba, Korogwe, Handeni and Lushoto) in the last 12 months.
Malaria is, however, endemic in the whole country and increasing
transmission occurs regularly during this period.

[The previous post, referenced below the title, occurred in the Kagera
region in northwestern Tanzania, diametrically across the country from
Sumbawanga District. In view of the report above, can we assume that the
earlier outbreak was also due to falciparum malaria?
This kind of scare over an outbreak of a deadly "new" disease that turns
out in the end to be (still deadly) malaria happens several times a year in
the tropical world. It is interesting how a disease as common as malaria
can appear in forms that baffle the local populace and health authorities,
and also that the routine taking of thick & thin blood films, which would
resolve the diagnosis on the spot, seems to have gone out of use.
Medical practitioners in malaria-free countries would do well to bear these
things in mind when seeing febrile patients with a travel history to
malarious areas. According to Eurosurveillance Monthly, Vol 3 No 5 (May
1998) it is estimated that 10,000 to 12,000 imported cases of malaria are
now notified annually in the countries of the European Union -- one can
imagine how many more are not notified!
Sorry to disappoint malaria buffs, but this is NOT intended to restart a
discussion of malaria outbreaks on ProMED-mail, but to bring closure to the
earlier report from
Tanzania, which was suspected to have been something else. - Mod.JW
