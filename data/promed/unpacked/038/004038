A Georgia researcher has discovered a common minnow can help
protect farm-raised catfish from hamburger gill disease, which
costs the industry between $50 million and $100 million a year.
Farm-raised catfish have become the fifth most popular food fish in
the United States. The industry supplied only 6 million pounds in
1970, but now produces more than 525 million pounds worth about
$592 million each year.
Gary Burtle, an aquaculture specialist at the University of
Georgia's Coastal Plain Experiment Station in Tifton, has
demonstrated that flathead minnows, a common, inexpensive fish
bait, offer protection from the hamburger gill disease.
"From the reports I get, it works, but it's not 100 percent,'' Burtle
said. "We haven't totally solved this problem, but we have reduced
the severity of the infection.''
Hamburger gill disease can kill an entire pond of catfish in as little
as 3 days. It damages the gills, making it tough for the fish to get
enough oxygen. They eventually suffocate. It is the fourth most
common fatal catfish disease.
During his tests, Burtle discovered an almost invisible worm, about
a half-inch long and thin as a human hair, harbors the parasite
causing hamburger gill disease.
"If you build a pond, you probably will have these worms,'' he said,
noting the worm population seems to be higher in freshly dug
ponds, or ponds having been emptied and refilled.
The worm, known as _Dero digitata_, is found all over the world. It
is a host for a protozoan releasing spores. The spores get trapped
in the catfish's gills, leaving them looking like hamburger meat.
"We tried to find chemicals to combat the parasite, but we decided
chemicals that would kill the worms would kill the catfish,'' Burtle
said. "We looked for a fish that would be very effective at seeking
these worms out in the mud. The carp was best, but it grows large
and would compete with the catfish for feed.''
Then he decided to try the flathead minnow, which is in the carp
family. The 2 1/2- to 3-inch (8-9cm) minnow is olive drab on top and
white on the bottom.
"We place them in beakers with the worms and they eat them in
seconds,'' Burtle said.
Fish farmers are already using the minnows in Georgia, South
Carolina, Arkansas, Alabama and Florida, Burtle said. He
recommends about 10 pounds for each acre of pond.
Burtle said fish farmers could conduct monitoring programs to
detect the worms, but they would be considerably more expensive
and time consuming.
"We're suggesting they stock the minnows,'' he said. "They take
about a month to reduce the population to a non-threatening level.''

actual parasite that does the damage. Could it be
_Trichophyra_? Can anyone help? - Mod.JW]
