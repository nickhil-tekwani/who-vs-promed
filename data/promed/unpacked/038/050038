A man from Kota Samarahan has become the state's 1st Japanese encephalitis (JE) casualty this year [2018].

Sarawak Health Department director Dr Jamilah Hashim, who confirmed the case yesterday [31 Jan 2018], said the 25-year-old from Kampung Tanjung Bundong was one of 2 JE cases reported in the state from [1-30 Jan 2018], with the other case occurring in Lawas.

"The victim died on [19 Jan 2018] while being treated at the Sarawak General Hospital (SGH) in Kuching, after he was diagnosed with JE in early January," she said when contacted.

According to the director, another death due to JE was reported in Sarawak last year [2017] from a total of 10 cases. "In 2017, there was a fatal case reported. However, generally for Sarawak, JE cases are on a decline, from 20 cases in 2015 to 13 cases in 2016, and 10 cases last year [2017]," she said.

Dr Jamilah explained that the department is still continuing with JE prevention efforts in Taman Malihah, Matang [in Kuching] following a case involving a resident there last December [2017].

She said similar activities are being carried out in Tanjung Bundong, Kota Samarahan, along with a population census aimed at identifying people eligible for JE vaccination at Long Sukang, Lawas where the other JE case was detected.

She added that steps taken in those areas include fogging to eliminate mosquitoes and also the clearing of mosquito habitat such as stagnant water collected in cans and blocked drains.

"Residents in those areas are also required to take precautionary measures to protect themselves from mosquito bites by using repellents, especially when conducting outdoor activities, and using mosquito nets when sleeping or installing screens on windows."

Dr Jamilah said spray aerosols can be used to kill adult mosquitoes inside the house, and advised those who fear they may be infected to seek treatment at the nearest medical facility.

Japanese encephalitis is a disease spread through mosquito bites. Symptoms usually take 5-15 days to develop and include fever, headache, vomiting and malaise, before eventually leading to swelling around the brain and coma.

[Cases of Japanese encephalitis occur sporadically in peninsular Malaysia and infrequently on the island of Borneo. South East Asia, including Malaysia, is endemic for Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). ProMED-mail posted a case of JE last year on Sarawak involving a 7-year-old boy (see Japanese encephalitis - Malaysia (SK) 20170708.5159294). Sarawak is well within the JE virus endemic area. Control of vector mosquitoes is difficult. Elimination of breeding sites around buildings and avoidance of mosquito bites are prudent preventive measures. However, because vector mosquito control over large areas is difficult and expensive, vaccination is perhaps the most effective measure to prevent cases of JE.

In JE virus-endemic areas, birds, especially ardeids (herons and relatives), are reservoir hosts of the virus, which is transmitted by several species of mosquitoes in the genus _Culex_. Pigs can serve as amplifying hosts.

Sarawak is one of 2 Malaysian states on the island of Borneo. Located in northwest Borneo, Sarawak is bordered by the Malaysian state of Sabah to the northeast, Kalimantan, the Indonesian portion of Borneo, to the south, and the independent country of Brunei in the north.
