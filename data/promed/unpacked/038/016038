A Comment on "Japanese Encephalitis Virus - Australia: Natural Barriers",
posted on 15 Jan 2001
------------------------------------
The report on possible natural barriers to Japanese encephalitis virus
establishment in northern Australia, and in particular, that infection of
pigs with "native viruses" such as Murray Valley encephalitis and Kunjin
viruses could protect feral pigs from infection with Japanese encephalitis
[virus and therefore act as a natural barrier, is a little simplistic.
These "native viruses" also occur widely in Papua New Guinea, and despite
their presence, did not appear to inhibit the spread of Japanese
encephalitis virus in that country. There is also the evidence from India
where Japanese encephalitis is encroaching into areas where West Nile virus
is endemic, and both viruses appear to be able to circulate. As with most
cases in which endemic arbovirus activity occurs in wildlife-mosquito
cycles, it is the young animals that tend to be involved in transmission;
older animals have usually been exposed previously. Thus, in the only
Australian mainland case of Japanese encephalitis, older semi-domesticated
pigs at a small facility near the location of the human infection had
evidence of previous exposure to more than one "native" flavivirus and
would not have participated in the transmission cycles, whereas young
animals were seropositive to Japanese encephalitis virus only, and
undoubtedly were involved in transmission cycles.
Experience in parts of India and some other countries has suggested that
epidemic Japanese encephalitis can also occur in the absence of pigs as the
major amplifying vertebrate host. In Cape York of northern Australia (where
the human case occurred), the habitat is also one in which ardeid birds are
present in significant numbers, including one of the major maintenance
hosts of Murray Valley encephalitis and Kunjin viruses, the nankeen night
heron, which is closely related to one of the major maintenance hosts of
Japanese encephalitis virus, the black-crowned night heron. Indeed the
nankeen night heron was shown experimentally to be a possible host of
Japanese encephalitis virus a number of years ago by Boyle and Marshall.
The evidence obtained at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory that some
species of macropod, especially the Eastern Grey Kangaroo and the Agile
Wallaby, were probably unable to support sufficient levels of Japanese
encephalitis viremia to enable them to participate in transmission cycles,
is useful information in helping to define the future risks associated with
the establishment of Japanese encephalitis in Australia. However, these
experiments were carried out by inoculation of virus rather than by
mosquito transmission. There is also some evidence, I understand, that
smaller marsupials such as possums may have higher viremias and therefore
be potential vertebrate hosts.
Thus if, as expected, Japanese encephalitis virus does become established
in Australia, the ecology of the virus in Australia is likely to be a
complex interaction of transmission cycles in which a number of different
wildlife vertebrate host species (and mosquito species) may be involved.

[Prof Mackenzie has identified factors which would limit the potential
ability of endemic flaviviruses to function as "natural vaccines"
restricting the spread of non-native flaviviruses. In a previous
unpublished comment to the Moderator, Dr. C.H. Calisher pointed out also
that Murray Valley encephalitis and Kunjin viruses would need to be widely
distributed in the far north of Queensland, which is the most likely route
by which Japanese encephalitis virus would reach southern Queensland and
elsewhere in Australia. It would be irrelevant whether Murray Valley
encephalitis and Kunjin viruses could protect against Japanese encephalitis
virus infection if these viruses do not occur where the incursion would
take place. - Mod.CP
