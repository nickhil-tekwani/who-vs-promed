A Pennsylvania hospital said [Mon 26 Oct 2015] that it's telling about 1300 open-heart surgery patients they could have been exposed to a bacterial infection after identifying 8 patients who contracted nontuberculous mycobacterium, or NTM [infection]. 4 of those patients died. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] stopped short of directly linking the deaths to the infection, as all 4 for of the patients had underlying medical conditions. But the hospital acknowledged that the infection probably was a contributing factor.

NTM is a naturally occurring bacterium found in soil and water, including, sometimes, tap water. People become infected by inhaling the bacteria, according to the American Lung Association. Most people do not become ill, although those with weakened immune systems are at risk. This can include someone recovering from an invasive procedure. The result is a pulmonary illness that can take more than a year of antibiotic treatment to cure.

WellSpan York Hospital in York, Pennsylvania, is contacting all patients who underwent open-heart surgery between [1 Oct 2011 and 24 Jul 2015]. "We know that the news of this potential risk of infection may be concerning to our open-heart patients, and we sincerely regret any distress that it may create for those patients and their families," said Keith Noll, senior vice president of WellSpan Health and president of WellSpan York Hospital.

In July [2015], a study published in the medical journal Clinical Infectious Diseases [1] found a risk of bacteria escaping from heater-cooler devices used during open-heart surgeries. The devices heat or cool the patient during surgery and usually stand about 8 to 10 feet away, said Brett Marcy, a spokesman for WellSpan Health.

According to a news release, the infection risk is thought to be limited to the patients who underwent the surgery. No physicians, clinicians, staff or patients who had noninvasive heart procedures were at risk. "The safety, health and well-being of our patients is always our highest priority," Noll said. "That is why we took this very seriously and immediately notified state and federal health officials and requested their assistance and guidance."

The hospital also replaced its heater-cooler devices with new equipment in late July [2015] after consulting with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Pennsylvania Department of Health. "The new equipment is being meticulously maintained according to the enhanced cleaning procedures," Noll said. He's referring to steps recommended by the Food and Drug Administration that hospitals can implement when using these devices, including not using tap water; taking environmental, air and water samples; and directing the vent of the device away from the surgical field.

They were issued as part of a safety communication from the FDA this month [October 2015] because the problem may be more widespread. According to the FDA, there were 32 reports of patient infections associated with heater-cooler devices or bacterial heater-cooler device contamination between January 2010 and August 2015. Of those reports, 8 were in the United States, and most of the other 24 were in Western Europe, the agency said. And 25 of the reports were made this year [2015]. Not all of the reports were among patients who had undergone cardiac surgery, but some reports don't identify the procedure the patient had undergone, the safety communication states.

Last week [week of 19 Oct 2015], the CDC issued recommendations to health officials, health care providers and health care facilities to be on the lookout for any such cases and to take steps to prevent them. It is working with local and state health officials, as well as the FDA. "The most important action to protect patients will be to remove contaminated heater-coolers from operating rooms, and ensure that those in service are correctly maintained," the CDC says. The CDC also asks patients who have undergone cardiac procedures to tell their doctor if they were exposed to this device or if they are experiencing a combination of symptoms, including fever, pain, redness, heat or pus around their surgical incision, night sweats, joint or muscle pain, and fatigue.

WellSpan York is the 2nd hospital in Pennsylvania associated with a potentially deadly infection in recent months. In September [2015], the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center voluntarily suspended organ transplants after 3 transplant patients died after contracting a fungal infection.

Marcy stressed the situations at the 2 hospitals are unrelated. "No connection between Pittsburgh and here; this is different scenario," he said.

Interim practical guidance. Non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) infections and heater-cooler devices
----------------------------------------------------------------------
CDC has identified a need for increased vigilance for NTM infections by health departments, healthcare facilities, and individual healthcare providers. FDA recently issued a Safety Communication on Nontuberculous Mycobacterium Infections Associated with Heater-Cooler Devices [http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/AlertsandNotices/ucm466963.htm] that addresses issues regarding the proper use and maintenance of these devices. CDC has been working with the FDA and local and state health departments to investigate heater-cooler units associated with NTM infections and/or found to be contaminated with NTM. This CDC communication is to (a) raise awareness among health departments, healthcare facilities, and healthcare providers of the possible association between NTM infections and use of heater-cooler devices and (b) to provide guidance on identifying patients with infection.

Summary
-------
Heater-cooler devices are commonly used during cardiac surgical procedures to warm and cool a patient's blood during cardiopulmonary bypass. NTM are slow-growing bacteria that are found in surface water, tap water, and soil. Recent reports have suggested an association between heater-cooler devices and NTM infections among patients undergoing cardiac surgery potentially through the aerosolization of bacteria from contaminated water used in these devices.

The most important action to protect patients will be to remove contaminated heater-coolers from operating rooms, and ensure that those in service are correctly maintained.

Patients who might have been exposed to NTM during a surgical procedure should continue to look for signs of potential infection and keep in touch with their clinicians for further evaluation. Due to the potentially long delay between exposure to NTM and manifestation of clinical infection (up to several years), identifying infections related to the use of heater-cooler devices can be challenging.

Mycobacterial infections associated with heater cooler units used in cardiothoracic surgery. Advice for providers of cardiothoracic surgery
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Retrospective case finding has identified 13 patients in the UK with mycobacterial endocarditis, aortic root abscess, sternal wound infection, or disseminated infection subsequent to cardiothoracic surgery. 10 have been confirmed to date as being _Mycobacterium chimaera_. These cases have not been definitively linked to the device as they have been identified long after the surgery was undertaken. Mycobacterial investigation is not routine in post surgical infections and this infection may be under-diagnosed.

Microbiological sampling of heater cooler devices at several NHS sites has demonstrated a range of bacteria in the water within the device, including _M. chimaera_ in many cases. Experimental testing of a machine has demonstrated that a microbial aerosol is generated.

The 13 probable cases in the UK underwent repair or replacement of heart valves. Their surgery was undertaken in 8 different NHS trusts. The earliest cases underwent surgery in 2007 and the most recent case in 2013.

13 probable cases have been identified from all surgeries undertaken in the NHS likely to have been on bypass, over 7 years, approximately totalling 560 000 years of living post operation. Thus, at present the crude incidence rate is 0.2 (95 percent confidence interval 0.1 to 0.4) per 10 000 years of post-operative follow-up. Patients previously receiving extracorporeal circulation may remain at risk from this organism and if it is assumed that the risk of developing a frank infection is constant over time, and remains for 7 years post-operation (which may equate roughly to life expectancy in these patient) then there is approximately an additional 420 000 years at risk. This equates to an additional 5 to 17 such infections that could manifest themselves over the next 6 years, giving an estimate of the eventual total number of cases between 18 and 30.

Sorin [the manufacturer of the heater-cooler device] has released a Field Safety Notice. This advises that microbiological testing of heater cooler units is undertaken. A series of actions are advised by Sorin while waiting for local testing results. If machines are found to be contaminated, Sorin advises local infection control decision-making, and if mycobacteria are found in the air of the operating theatre, Sorin advises that the heater cooler is removed from service and that local infection control teams should make decisions regarding emergency surgeries.
Investigations concerning other brands of heater cooler will continue.

Nontuberculous mycobacterium infections associated with heater-cooler devices: FDA safety communication: summary of problem and scope
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Heater-cooler devices are used during cardiothoracic surgeries, as well as other medical and surgical procedures to warm or cool a patient to optimize medical care and improve patient outcomes. Heater-cooler devices include water tanks that provide temperature-controlled water to external heat exchangers or warming/cooling blankets through closed circuits. Although the water in the circuits does not come into direct contact with the patient, there is the potential for contaminated water to enter other parts of the device or transmit bacteria through the air (aerosolize) through the device's exhaust vent into the environment and to the patient.

Through the FDA's analysis of adverse event reports, the medical literature, and information from national and international public health agencies, we are aware that the use of heater-cooler devices has been associated with nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infections, primarily in patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgical procedures. NTM organisms are widespread in nature and can be found in soil and water, including tap water sources. They are typically not harmful, but in rare cases may cause infections in very ill patients and/or in individuals with compromised immune systems.

Between January 2010 and August 2015, the FDA received 32 Medical Device Reports (MDRs) of patient infections associated with heater-cooler devices or bacterial heater-cooler device contamination. Twenty-five of these MDRs were reported to the FDA in 2015. Some reports describe NTM infections related to cardiothoracic surgeries, but other reports do not specify the procedure the patient was undergoing. 8 reports were related to 3 events describing patient infections occurring in US health care facilities. The remaining 24 reports involved health care facilities outside the United States, most of these in Western Europe. In some cases, patients presented with infections several months to years after their surgical procedures. It is important to note that half of the 32 reports submitted to the FDA describe bacterial contamination of the heater-cooler device without known patient involvement or infection. The FDA is not aware of NTM infections acquired by hospital staff.

It is possible that some cases have not been reported to the FDA. It is challenging for a health care facility, health care provider, manufacturer, or patient to recognize that infections, particularly NTM infections, may be associated with the use of or exposure to a particular medical device. The FDA continues to evaluate reports through follow up with health care facilities and manufacturers to determine which factors may have contributed to the reported events.

[The 1st and 2nd articles above concern the development of non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) post-open heart surgical infections in 8 patients in the US suspected to be linked to the use of a specific brand of heater cooler machine. The species of NTM is not specified. This machine was implicated in a Swiss report of non-tuberculous mycobacterial (specifically _Mycobacterium chimaera_) post-open heart surgical infections published online on 11 Mar 2015 in the medical journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, the abstract of which was previously posted by ProMED-mail (Mycobacterium chimaera - Europe: post-open heart surgery infections 20150513.3358596). This brand of heater cooler machine is widely used in the US and Europe, including the UK.

The 3rd article above concerns the follow-up to an initial report of planned investigations by Public Health England (PHE) to assess the risk posed by the heater cooler device in the UK that ProMED-mail also previously posted (Mycobacterium chimaera - Europe: post-open heart surgery infections 20150513.3358596). PHE now reports 13 patients in the UK with mycobacterial endocarditis, aortic root abscess, sternal wound infection or disseminated infection subsequent to cardiothoracic surgery. 10 have been confirmed to date as being _M. chimaera_. These cases have not been definitively linked to the heater cooler machine, but microbiological sampling of the machines at several NHS sites demonstrated _M. chimaera_ in the water within the device. The 4th article above concerns the FDA response to the problem.

The following has been extracted from my comments in the prior ProMED-mail post (Mycobacterium chimaera - Europe: post-open heart surgery infections 20150513.3358596):

_Mycobacterium chimaera_ is a non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) (NTM is a grouping outside of the _M. tuberculosis_ complex) in the _M. avium-M. intracellulare_ complex (MAC). _M. chimaera_ is a slow growing acid-fast bacillus that is commonly found in environmental water and soil (http://cmr.asm.org/content/6/3/266.full.pdf). Because of its close relationship to _M. intracellulare_, _M. chimaera_ strains can be misidentified as _M. intracellulare_. _M. chimaera_ is known to cause pulmonary disease, but until the reports from Switzerland (1, 2), _M. chimaera_ had not been reported as a cause of bloodstream infection or endocarditis. Mycobacterial endocarditis is rare, and the predominant causative mycobacterial pathogens are the rapidly growing NTM (http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0102-76382015000100017&script=sci_arttext).
