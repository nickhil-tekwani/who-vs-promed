[The European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth disease (FMD) monthly report "Global Foot-and-Mouth Disease Situation," May 2018 (see http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/FMD_reports_GMR/May_GMR_2018_270618.pdf) notes that:

"FMDV SAT 1 was responsible for the 62 outbreaks that occurred in the southeast part of the country between November 2017 and April 2018 involving cattle and goats. The outbreaks were due to contact with wild species and infected animals at grazing/watering points. The infection continues to spread slowly in the affected districts due to the limited supply of vaccine available. All the infected districts were placed under quarantine with veterinary check-points also controlled by police personnel placed at strategic areas to prevent cattle movement. Inspections and community education campaigns are currently on-going. Any illegally moved cattle are being destroyed so as to deter farmers. The control measures in place are represented by movement control inside the country, vaccination in response to the outbreaks, surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone, surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, traceability, quarantine, control of wildlife reservoirs, zoning".
