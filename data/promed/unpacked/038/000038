Alberta: First Report of West Nile Virus-infected Mosquitoes
--------------------------------------------------
Alberta Environment announced on the afternoon of Tue 22 Jul 2003 that a
sample of mosquitoes trapped in Brooks tested positive for West Nile virus,
prompting further warnings for people to take precautions against the
virus, which is yet to be found in humans in this province.
The mosquitoes were collected on 15 Jul 2003, just 6 days after the virus
first turned up in the province. On 9 Jul 2003, the province confirmed a
dead magpie found near Camrose, southeast of Edmonton, had tested positive
for West Nile virus. A bird found near Medicine Hat has also tested positive.
The mosquitoes trapped in Brooks were _Culex tarsalis_, the species experts
expected to surface in Alberta with West Nile virus. With the disease
spreading westward, health officials believed it was only a matter of time.
"We knew it was in the mosquito population, and now we've just happened to
catch some with the disease," said Robert Moyles, a spokesman for Alberta
Environment. "These mosquitoes may have shown up in Brooks, but we already
have magpies in Camrose and Medicine Hat, so chances are pretty good there
are mosquitoes with it there, too."
"The species more likely to carry it is more likely to show up in southern
Alberta ... they like the warmer temperatures. When it gets a bit warmer,
we see their numbers increase from the bottom of the province on up," he
said. Last week's tests did show that the proportion of _Culex tarsalis_ in
the Calgary area in the past week-and-a-half had more than doubled from one
to 2 percent, something that was expected as temperatures rise. "The
finding (in Brooks) doesn't change or alter the overall risk to people,"
said Dr. Brent Friesen, medical officer of health for the Calgary Health
Region. "There's certainly no need for people to stop or discontinue
activities or enjoying the outdoors."
More than 200 pools of mosquitoes have been tested in the past few weeks.
Alberta's mosquito surveillance program collects adult female
mosquitoes from traps across the province each week. The insects are
frozen, sorted, identified, and shipped to the provincial laboratory in
Calgary for testing.
