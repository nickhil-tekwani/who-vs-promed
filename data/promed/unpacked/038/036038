[1] Ghana: suspected case
Date: Tue 8 Jul 2014

The American who was suspected to be carrying the ebolavirus at the Nyaho Clinic in Accra is reported dead after blood testing on him revealed signs of the disease were glaring. The American, name withheld, died yesterday afternoon [7 Jul 2014] while under surveillance at the infirmary. He arrived from Guinea on Sunday [6 Jul 2014] and reported to the clinic for medical attention [he had also been in Sierra Leone].

The initial tests run on the American, now deceased, according to the source, were inconclusive because the officials used the wrong reagent. The sources, who are medical practitioners, told Joy News, "The test should have taken Noguchi [Medical Research Institute] not more than 5 hours. But Myjoyonline.com learnt from the Public Relations Officer of the Health Ministry, Tony Goodman, that his outfit had requested some reagents from the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology [Kumasi, Ghana] to further help with the investigations. Signals are that the blood samples could also be flown to [CDC] Atlanta in the United States for further testing. Early on, the Head of Disease Surveillance of the Ghana Health Service, Dr. Badu Sarkodie, told Joy News more work would be done later today [8 Jul 2014] on the sample before a substantive conclusion could be determined.

As a result, Ghana's Health Ministry is currently having a crunch meeting with stakeholders on the matter. The meeting is supposed to strategize on how to contain the deadly ebolavirus, should the disease break out in the country.

Following a phone call, a Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) team went to the home of [a 33-year-old female]. She reported extreme weakness, vomiting, and dysentery [bloody diarrhea]. These symptoms are typical of those caused by ebolavirus.

MSF is working to treat patients and contain the Ebola outbreak that is currently gripping Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia in West Africa. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there have been 779 cases and 481 deaths [as of 2 Jul 2014] since the beginning of the outbreak in these 3 countries.

Guinea
------
In Guinea, MSF is running 3 medical projects to respond to the Ebola emergency: one in Donka Hosptal in Conakry [the capital], one in Telimele in Basse-Guinee, and another in Gueckedou, in Guinee forestiere, the epicentre of the outbreak. On each project, MSF offers medical and psychosocial care in specialised Ebola virus disease [EVD] treatment centres, ambulance services, disinfection of bodies, and safe burials. MSF is also carrying out activities to clean areas contaminated by the virus, such as treatment centres, homes, and public places, and is offering support in contact tracing and epidemiological analysis.

In Conakry, MSF has treated 59 patients with EVD, 33 of whom have recovered. In Gueckedou, the team has treated 130 patients, and 31 have recovered. Also, in Telimele, the MSF team has treated 21 confirmed cases, 16 of whom have recovered. They are in the process of closing the project as there were no cases for 21 days [impressive survival rates, totaling 80/200; the case fatality rate (CFR) is only 40 percent as against the oft-quoted 90 percent. - Mod.JW].

Likewise, MSF has closed the treatment centre in Macenta, Guinee forestiere, as there were no new cases for 21 days. In Macenta, teams treated 7, of whom 5 died, and 2 recovered.

Sierra Leone
------------
In Sierra Leone, MSF is operating in Kailahun, Kenema, Koindu and Daru, in the east of the country. MSF set up the 50-bed treatment centre in Kailahun, which has been operating since the beginning of July 2014. MSF has already treated 45 suspected, probable and confirmed cases of EVD in the Kailahun project; 12 of those patients have died. In collaboration with the Ministry of Health (MoH), teams are also seeing patients at pre-screening facilities in Koinduand Daru. While doing their outreach activities, MSF teams are hearing that there are 10-15 suspected cases of EVD in some villages. MSF with the MoH identified one village with more than 40 suspected cases.

Liberia
-------
MSF is supporting the MoH in their efforts to stop the spread of EVD in the capital, Monrovia, with a team of 4. In Foya, MSF is handing over the project it set up to another NGO.

[3] Religious appeals - media report

Senior government officials currently in Islam's holiest city of Mecca have called on Sierra Leone's Muslim population to take advantage of the holy month of Ramadan to offer prayers and sacrifices for divine mercy to stop the spread of the Ebola virus in the West African nation.

In a joint appeal to the Muslim community after Fri 4 Jul 2014, congregational prayers at the Grand Mosque of Mecca (Al-Masjid al-Haram), Sierra Leone's Minister of Social Welfare who also doubles as Chairman of the 2014 Sierra Leone Hajj Affairs, Hon. Alhaji Moijue Kaikai, Sierra Leone's Ambassador in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, H.E Alhaji M.S. Kargbo and Special Assistant to H.E The President on Political and Religious Affairs, Hon. Nuru Deen Sankoh-Yillah asked Muslims to multiply their prayers, offer sacrifices and read the Holy Qur'an during this blessed month of Ramadan for the elimination of the deadly virus in their country.

It would be recalled that Sierra Leone's President Dr. Ernest Koroma last Tuesday, 1 Jul 2014, called on all Sierra Leoneans to join forces with the government to fight the dreaded Ebola virus disease threatening his country.

In a televised address to the nation, the President said that the fight against Ebola should be a matter for everyone in the country. "This is not only a matter for our brothers and sisters in the Kenema and Kailahun districts, it is a fight for every one of us, everyone in the government, everyone in every political party, in every region, every district, city, town and village," said the President. The appeal by the Minister and the Presidential Aide -- who are currently in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on pre-arrangements for would-be Sierra Leone pilgrims to the 2014 Hajj -- and the Ambassador has been widely hailed.

Ibrahim Koroma is a Sierra Leonean student in neighbouring Qatar, and he is currently in Mecca to perform Islam's Minor Pilgrimage (Umrah). He described their action as "very timely." He added that: "It is the right step in the right direction, and it should be emulated in other quarters; as it is a clarion call by no less a person than the father of the nation."

[It is heartening news that MSF has been able to cure 60 percent of its EVD patients in Guinea, allowing it to close 2 of its treatment centres.

The Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research (NMIMR), Legon, Accra, Ghana was named in honour of a Japanese researcher who worked for the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in Ghana and died there of yellow fever in the classic tradition of experimenting on himself.

A good National Geographic map of the spread of the epidemic, showing neighbouring countries at risk, is at: http://images.nationalgeographic.com/wpf/media-content/photos/000/813/cache/81377_990x742-cb1404252740.jpg. - Mod.JW]
