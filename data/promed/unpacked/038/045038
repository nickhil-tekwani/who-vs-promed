A Monmouthshire [Wales] farm is being investigated after a number of visitors tested positive for a microscopic parasite that causes a diarrheal disease. Public Health Wales, Torfaen County Borough Council and Monmouthshire County Councilare investigating an outbreak of cryptosporidium at Coleg Gwent's farm in Usk. So far, 3 people have tested positive for cryptosporidium and 8 others are under investigation after a regular attendance at the farm.

Doctors in the Gwent area have been told to alert people about the disease. Heather Lewis, a consultant in health protection for Public Health Wales, said: "[Cryptosporidiosis] is a disease that is very common in young farm animals and can easily be passed to people who come into contact with those animals.

"All the confirmed cases had direct contact with the lambs at the college farm. As part of our investigations, we are checking on all those whom we believe had contact with these animals and Coleg Gwent is coÂ­operating fully with our investigations.

_Cryptosporidium_ is a single celled parasite that can cause a disease called cryptosporidiosis. Both humans and animals can catch the illness. It is the biggest cause of human gastrointestinal infection in Britain. The symptoms include diarrhoea, vomiting, stomach ache, and weight loss. Ms Lewis said: "[Cryptosporidiosis] is a disease that is very common in young farm animals and can easily be passed to people who come into contact with those animals. "Good hand washing after coming into contact with farm animals is of the utmost importance in preventing infection with cryptosporidium," Ms Lewis said. "There is no reason for anyone to avoid visiting petting farms as long as they ensure that anyone who has touched animals, thoroughly washes their hands with hot water and soap immediately afterwards."
