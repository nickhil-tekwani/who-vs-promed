Anthrax in the Upper Hunter Valley Region in NSW, Australia
-----------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
During December 2007, anthrax was confirmed on 9 farms in the Scone
district located within the Upper Hunter River Valley catchment. The
New South Wales Department of Primary Industries (NSW DPI) has
instituted quarantine measures, incineration of carcasses, and
vaccination on affected and neighbouring farms. Surveillance has been
intensified in the district to detect any other cases.
Background
----------
Anthrax is an acute infectious bacterial disease affecting many
species of domestic and wild animals, and humans. It is a notifiable
disease in New South Wales. Outbreaks of the disease tend to be
confined to a recognised nthrax "belt?" which runs through the centre
of New South Wales and into Victoria. However, the Hunter Valley is
not located in the anthrax "belt" and investigations are continuing
into the likely source of the disease. Flooding in the Hunter River
catchment did occur in June 2007 and more recent rain the week before
the deaths may have moved or exposed spores from an unknown cattle
grave (as the moderator suggested in the 26 Dec 2007 posting).
Determining the source of anthrax outbreaks can be very difficult.
Anthrax occurrence is best described as unpredictable, although there
do appear to be some trends. The disease is sometimes associated with
close grazing of paddocks, especially stubble paddocks, but can also
occur in lush pastures as occurred in this case. It seems to occur
more frequently during summer and autumn, but is also seen following
particularly wet conditions. This unpredictability means that owners
of livestock and veterinarians in NSW are advised to always consider
anthrax when sudden deaths occur in grazing stock.
NSW has an excellent network of veterinarians and laboratories for
confirming the presence of diseases such as anthrax.
Incidents in the Scone district
-------------------------------
To date, anthrax has been confirmed on 9 farms. All affected and
neighbouring farms have been quarantined and vaccinated. Vaccinated
farms will remain under movement restrictions for at least 42 days
post vaccination. Rapid tracing of animals and animal products from
affected farms has been assisted by the National Livestock
Identification System (NLIS). No movements have occurred from the
affected farms in the 20 days before the 1st anthrax death on each
farm. Carcasses (not just confirmed cases) on affected farms have
been disposed of by burning.
More generally, a small number of cases of anthrax (4 to 6 per annum)
are expected in the so-called anthrax "belt" in New South Wales,
Australia. These will continue to be managed in accordance with policy
using quarantine, vaccination, and appropriate carcass disposal.

[We greatly appreciate this authoritative communication from Canberra.
It is such contacts that make ProMED-mail stand out from other
reporting systems.
Their link has a simple map of the "Anthrax Belt" in NSW. Spore
viability in soil depends on soil characteristics. The best survival
is in alkaline soils with high calcium and organic matter contents,
that is, mollic or chernozem soils. Below a soil pH of 6.1 the spores
do not survive and disappear in 14-18 months. If the Scone soils are
lower than 6.1 pH other explanations than surfacing spores may be in
order.
The WHO Guidelines recommendation for quarantine is 21 days, not 42;
ditto OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health). In my experience
quarantine should be kept as short as possible as long periods inhibit
reporting suspect cases. Obviously in extraordinary epidemics, as in
2006 in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, blanket area quarantine is in
order. But I can quote place after place where long quarantines carry
a high cost for a number of following years. Texas with a lot of
experience with this disease and from past mistakes now has a 14 day
quarantine; they are still paying for their 3+ month quarantine in the
early 1970s by vets being ordered by their older rancher clients in
some areas to not submit samples to the state diagnostic laboratory.
Failure to obey the order results in losing him and his neighbours as
clients. As a result they diagnose on the basis of a necropsy with the
real risk to the person doing the necropsy and from the subsequent
soil contamination in the area. There is a parallel situation in
Northern Mexico where diagnosis depends on stained blood smears.
Lastly, the Argentines have had some success with an alternative
method of carcass disposal as trees are markedly absent in their
enzootic areas and therefore carcass burning is essentially impossible
on site. Instead they soak the carcass and surrounding immediate area
with 5-10 percent formaldehyde to decontaminate the area and
discourage scavengers; then they cover the carcass with a heavy-duty
tarpauline and securely peg it down. Over 240-260 days the carcass
decomposes. They then burn off the tarpauline and the remaining bones
and grease using 5 L of diesel. For details go to

"Elimination of the carcasses of animals that have died from anthrax."
A problem with this method is that foxes will sometimes not be put off
by the formalin and will burrow into the carcass. - Mod MHJ]
