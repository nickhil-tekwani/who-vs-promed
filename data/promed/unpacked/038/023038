Ambulances are being turned away from Sydney hospitals as overflowing
emergency departments struggle to cope with a savage early flu season. At
Nepean Hospital, ambulances are being diverted almost every day, prompting
fears elective surgery may soon be cancelled. Westmead and Hornsby
hospitals have also been seriously affected, The Sunday Telegraph has
learned. Health Minister Craig Knowles yesterday urged people with minor
problems to avoid busy emergency departments. "I appeal to people with less
serious medical problems to think of their options for treatment before
fronting at a busy emergency department," he said. Emergency wards are
being flooded with extra patients as the number of serious flu cases leapt
500 per cent last week alone. There were 50 reported cases of the most
serious form of flu, type A, last week, compared with just nine in June
last year. There was one case of type B and 129 cases of other respiratory
illnesses.

Hutt Hospital is putting extra beds on standby to cover a rise in
flu-related respiratory infections.
Hutt Valley Health and Capital Coast Health (CCH) say they are busy with
patients who have respiratory illnesses. Hospitals in Auckland, Hamilton
and Christchurch have had to take urgent measures to deal with a severe flu
that has hit the country. Auckland's Middlemore Hospital has seen an
apparent jump in flu-related deaths. About 100 people died from mainly
respiratory illnesses last month. Waikato Hospital has filled an extra
15-bed ward to deal with the flu problem, and Christchurch Hospital has
stopped children's elective surgery to prevent the risk of
cross-infections. The major problem is people suffering from the Sydney A
flu strain. Symptoms include a sudden fever,coughs and aches and pains. It
was linked to 3000 deaths in Britain earlier this year.
