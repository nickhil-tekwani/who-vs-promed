The patient is was born in 1990. He was living in a house in Phu Loi Ward, Thu Dau Mot Town, according to the provincial Department of Health

He returned to his home province of Thanh Hoa during the Lunar New Year holidays late January, and has come back to Binh Duong to work. On 17 Feb 2012, he had high temperatures and breathing difficulty, and was brought to a local hospital.

On 23 Feb 2012, he was transferred to the Ho Chi Minh City Hospital for Infectious Diseases and Tropical Diseases as his conditions became worse. Blood samples later showed that he was infected with the deadly bird flu virus A/H5N1. Health officials said where he was infected with the virus was still unknown.

Health officials also quarantined those who had contacts with him in his rented house in Phu Loi Ward and disinfected the area with chemicals.
