Two school kids are in hospital amid fears they swallowed sinister capsules on school grounds.

Cops have launched a probe and issued an urgent warning over the alarming incident on Orkney.

The youngsters fell ill along with 3 other pupils at Kirkwall Grammar School with the local authority describing it as a "concerning situation".

The alarm was raised after the children necked pills containing an unknown liquid on Wednesday [26 Jan 2022] at Papdale Halls.

The halls provide accommodation for pupils aged between 12 and 18 who travel from outlying islands to study at the school.

It's understood the condition of the duo being treated in hospital is not serious but police are liaising with NHS Orkney and officials at Orkney Islands Council.

The local authority have confirmed a "concerning situation" was being investigated at the halls in Kirkwall and was now the subject of a cop probe.

A force spokesman urged mums and dads to speak with their kids as they urged anyone who may have the mystery pills in their possession to hand them over.

He said: "We are appealing for parents and carers to ask their children if they have in their possession an unknown substance, in particular a clear capsule possibly containing a brown or other coloured liquid.

"We are asking for parental support to assist in dealing with this situation and want to stress this is not about punishment, this is about the health and well-being of our young people at this time.

"Two young people remain in hospital however medical staff have said their conditions are not causing concern at this time.

"A joint investigation is ongoing to establish the circumstances surrounding the incident and inquiries are ongoing.

"Anyone with such a capsule is urged to hand it over to their parents, the school, an appropriate adult or the police, and not to ingest it."

A cop spokesperson said: "Police Scotland officers are liaising with NHS Orkney and Orkney Islands Council after 5 pupils took unwell at the Papdale Halls of Residence in Kirkwall yesterday, Wednesday, 26 January 2022."
