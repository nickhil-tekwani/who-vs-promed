Thailand: 11 More Suspected Avian Influenza Cases in Phichit Province
-----------------------------------------------
11 more suspected bird flu cases were reported in Thailand's lower
northern province of Phichit on Thu 27 Jul 2006. Dr. Prajak
Wattanakul, head of the Phichit Provincial Public Health Office, said
that the 11 patients, mostly children aged between 4-14, are
suspected of being infected with avian influenza virus and were
admitted to 5 different hospitals in the province on Thu 27 Jul 2006.
Some of them had contact with dead poultry and others live in areas
where a large number of fowl died of unknown causes.
All of the 11 patients were quarantined, and samples of their blood
and phlegm were sent for laboratory tests in the Medical Science
Center in Nakhon Sawan. The results of the tests are expected to be
released on Fri 28 Jul 2006.

[Only one of 8 recently reported suspected cases of avian influenza
virus infection in Thailand has been confirmed. The results of tests
on 2 of these suspected cases are pending still, and the 5 other
suspected cases have been ascribed now to seasonal human influenza
virus infection. The single confirmed fatal case was a 17-year-old
youth who unusually had tested positive for both dengue and H5N1
avian influenza virus infection. He resided in Phichit province and
had contact with fighting cocks prior to his death. The 11 new
suspected cases also reside in Phichit province. However, the results
of local laboratory tests are not available yet, and not all (or any)
may be confirmed as positive cases. - Mod.CP]
