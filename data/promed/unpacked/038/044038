A Comment on West Nile Virus Transmission in the UK
---------------------------------------------------
The preceding ProMED-mail post entitled West Nile virus, birds: antibody -
UK (02) [archived as 20030803.1903] referred to the search for mosquito
and/or tick vectors which could account for intra/inter-species spread of
West Nile virus within the UK bird population.
Dr Redig's work on raptors in the US with the virus has shown a possible
correlation with Hippoboscid (Flat-fly; Louse-fly) population numbers, and
it has been suggested that these insects rather than mosquitoes are
responsible for transmission.
Hippoboscids are common parasites on UK Hirundiniae (i.e. UK-Africa
migratory swallows/swifts/martins) as well as corvids and birds of prey,
amongst many others.
