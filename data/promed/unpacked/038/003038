Gold Coast attraction Sea World has lost one of its prized
attractions with the deaths of 25 of its 37 fairy penguins.
The birds started dying on Thursday [8 Mar 2007], leading to fears
they may have been infected with avian bird flu. This was ruled out
last night [Tue 13 Mar 2007] by the newly established Biosecurity
Queensland, which has been testing the birds.
Sea World's manager of marine sciences, Steve McCourt, last night
[Tue 13 Mar 2007] said he suspected the deaths were caused by a load
of contaminated gravel that had been placed in the bird's enclosure
as part of 3-monthly maintenance.
"All the staff here are absolutely devastated about this," Mr McCourt
said. We think there is some sort of toxin in the gravel."
Sea World 1st took samples to a private laboratory and then called in
Biosecurity, which worked on Monday night [12 Mar 2007] to clear up
fears of bird flu.
Mr McCourt declined to say where Sea World obtained the gravel.
Biosecurity Queensland principal veterinary officer, Ian Douglas,
said tests for bird flu were negative.
"It's a bit too early to speculate what's happened," he said. "But in
the veterinary world, it's not unusual to get a large number of
animals affected at the one time. If one is exposed to a toxin then
often they all are, and you get large crashes."
The display has been closed and the remaining penguins have been quarantined.
Mr McCourt said the 12 surviving birds were of mixed sex and, with
the species being a prolific breeder, this would be sufficient for
numbers to recover. "We've had the penguins here for over 20 years
and never had any issues before," he said. "Our primary focus is on
the remaining birds ... the enclosure has been completely stripped
and we're confident the situation has passed."
Dr Douglas said he had never seen a similar occurrence with
penguins. He said it might take 2 or more weeks to determine what
killed the birds.
Sea World's original saltwater public swimming pool was turned into
the Penguins on Parade exhibit about 20 years ago.

There has been considerable local media coverage of an episode
involving the deaths of 25 of 37 Australian little penguins at a
Queensland marine park.
These deaths commenced on 8 Mar 2007. The remaining 12 penguins are
reported to be recovering and no deaths have occurred during the last 4 days.
Biosecurity Queensland, an arm of the Queensland Department of
Primary Industries and Fisheries, is [collaborating] with the
veterinary staff at the park and private pathologists to determine
the cause of the mortality.
Highly pathogenic avian influenza was routinely excluded by PCR
[polymerase chain reaction] on 12 March 2007.
There are no reports of more widespread involvement and no immediate
indication that an infectious disease process is involved. A toxic
cause would seem to be most probable at this stage.
A range of diagnostic approaches will be used including
histopathology, culture, and toxicological studies.
The penguins are well contained and are unlikely to present any risk
to other birds or to people.

The fairy penquin is the smallest penguin, only about 16 inches (41
cm.) tall and about 2 pounds (0.9 kg.) in weight, and is found only
in the southern hemisphere. Its scientific name is _Eudyptula minor_.
Eudyptula is Greek for 'good diver'. They are blue or slate blue-grey
with a white stripe around the wings.
We are saddened by the loss of these birds. We look forward to
knowing what has killed them. There is not enough information here
to speculate on what toxin may have been in the gravel. - Mod.TG]
