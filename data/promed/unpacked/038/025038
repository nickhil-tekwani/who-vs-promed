Stripe rust: return of a wheat disease
--------------------------------------
After 10 years of absence, stripe rust has appeared in 2012 in all wheat and triticale-producing regions of Switzerland north of the Alps.

The investigations of Agroscope show that the infection was caused by a strain with virulences [see comment below] not previously reported in Switzerland. The disease affected certain wheat varieties, as well as triticale to a lesser degree. Disease severity also depended on the region. The results will form the basis for the adjustment of the list of recommended varieties.

Agroscope studied 3 stripe rust strains, from France, Belgium, and Switzerland, which are identical and show virulences new to Switzerland. In 2009, a strain with an unknown virulence was reported in Switzerland (ProMED-mail post 20091228.4366). The 2012 strain contains the virulence identified in 2009 as well as additional virulences.

Stripe rust occurs only rarely in Switzerland and current wheat and triticale varieties generally have good resistance. For an epidemic, both favourable weather conditions and the presence of a pathogen strain able to overcome existing host resistances are needed, and this is what happened in 2012. Breeding efforts are required again to develop new resistant crop cultivars.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale, and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow leaf stripes and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100 percent in wheat.

Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. Between seasons, the fungus survives on living host plants generating a "green bridge". Disease management includes the use of resistant varieties, fungicide applications, and control of volunteer crops.

New stripe rust strains with increased virulence are emerging worldwide. These include strains that show additional fungicide resistances and/or new "virulences" (ability to break down disease resistance conferred by specific host genes). Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been established in different regions for early detection of new rust strains and to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution.

Triticale (wheat-rye hybrids) affecting strains of stripe rust have also been reported, for example, from Australia (see links below) and Denmark (ProMED-mail posts 20120426.1114329). It is not clear whether the triticale virulence reported above is thought to be the same as the Danish one.

A related pathogen, _P. hordei_ (previously _P. striiformis_ f.sp. _hordei_), affects only barley.
