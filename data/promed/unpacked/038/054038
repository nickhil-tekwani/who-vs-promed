[The above report provides the information requested in ProMED-mail's
post (archive no. 20110131.0369), "if the identification of the
reported cases has been initially based on clinical findings or on
serological tests". Since the cases have been detected by serology, it
remains to be investigated when and by which route these animals had
been infected, and to try explain the low (less than 10 per cent)
apparent infection rate in the small ruminants. - Mod.AS]
