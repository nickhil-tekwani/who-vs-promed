-11 new confirmed case deaths, including 4 community deaths in Katwa, 7 deaths in CTEs: 3 in Katwa, 3 in Butembo and 1 in Beni.
-1 new person healed out of Butembo CTE.

News of the response
--------------------
Dignified and secure burials
- Further strengthening the commitment of the Catholic Church in the response to the Ebola epidemic, Bishop Melchizedek Sikuli Paluku, the Bishop of the Diocese of Butembo-Beni, asked the priests, religious, pastoral agents and faithful of his diocese to strictly adhere to a series of measures in relation to the celebration of Christian funerals.

- Henceforth, the celebration of funerals in parish churches is subject to the presentation of a certificate of medical examination, also called "SWAB". This involves taking a saliva sample from the deceased person who is then tested in the laboratory to determine if the person was contaminated with the Ebola virus.

- The accompaniers of patients who carry the Blessed Sacrament to their homes or health facilities must ensure the condition of the sick and take all necessary measures to prevent the administration of the Blessed Sacrament from being a source of contamination or propagation of the epidemic.

- If there is resistance from a family or a neighborhood to these new measures, the pastoral service will be temporarily suspended, as has already happened in some parishes.

- As a reminder, Monsignor Melchizedek Sikuli Paluku launched last December [2018] the campaign "Family Without Ebola", a project that is part of the citizen campaign "Ebola Pas Chez Moi".

Safety incident in Komanda
- On Sun 20 Jan 2019, an altercation broke out between a motorcyclist and health workers placed at a health checkpoint in the Komanda Health Zone. After refusing to wash his hands and submit to temperature control, the rider tried to attack the health workers. The police officers present at the scene then arrested the biker. In protest, a group of bikers decided to attack the health checkpoint, the home base of the response agents and the Komanda response coordination office. Fortunately, thanks to the rapid intervention of the police, the property damage is minimal with a few broken chairs at the coordination office. In total, 2 agents of the response were slightly injured.

Vaccination
- Since the beginning of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 64 403 people have been vaccinated.[-...more]

[2] Summaries

- Tue 22 Jan 2019. DRC Ebola total hits 699 amid more resistance, insecurity
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/01/drc-ebola-total-hits-699-amid-more-resistance-insecurity
[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

The number of confirmed cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Ebola outbreak has jumped by 19 since [Fri 18 Jan 2019], most of them in Katwa, where responders face more community resistance.

Over the course of the outbreak, responders have been grappling with evolving challenges in different areas. In today's update, the health ministry described a security incident at a health checkpoint in Komanda that injured 2 workers.

Katwa resistance fuels case spike
Of the 19 new cases reported [Sat 19 Jan 2019] through today [Tue 22 Jan 2019]; 14 are in Katwa, 2 in Vuhovi, and 1 each in Beni, Mabalako, and Oicha. The new illnesses lift the outbreak total to 699, which includes 650 confirmed and 49 probable cases. As of today [Tue 22 Jan 2019], authorities are still investigating 252 suspected cases.

In its [Sat 19 Jan 2019] update, the ministry said Katwa and Butembo are current hot spots, responsible for 65% of the new cases confirmed over the past 21 days. In Katwa, responders are encountering resistance from relatives of patients with confirmed infections. For example, reluctant contacts are refusing vaccination and follow-up, and the last 10 confirmed case-patients in Katwa are in the Muchanga health area and have family or neighborhood links.

In the former outbreak epicenter of Beni, cases have declined dramatically, but the newly reported case from the city involves a 19-day-old baby of a mother whose illness was reported on [Fri 18 Jan 2019].

Alongside the steady rise in new cases, the health ministry said 19 more people have died from Ebola, including 10 from Katwa, 5 from Butembo, 3 from Beni, and 1 from Mabalako. Of the 19 deaths, 8 occurred in the community, including 7 from Katwa and 1 from Mabalako. The latest deaths push the outbreak's overall fatality count to 433.

Security incident in Komanda
In its update today [Tue 22 Jan 2019], the health ministry reported a [Sun 20 Jan 2019] clash between a motorcyclist and health workers at a health checkpoint in Komanda health zone, one of the 4 affected areas of Ituri province . [See MoH report from 22 Jan 2019 above. - Mod.LK]

Earlier this month [January 2019], violence in Komanda injured a member of the health ministry vaccination team.

Recent cases in 13 health zones
In its latest weekly update on emergencies and outbreaks, the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office detailed the size and scope of the outbreak, noting that, of 18 affected health zones, 13 have reported at least one new confirmed case over the past 21 days. Aside from the Katwa and Butembo hot spots, the WHO said Oicha is a 3rd hot spot where resistance and insecurity pose significant challenges for outbreak responders.

The agency also noted that the newly affected health zone Kanya is located on the national road to Goma, the capital of North Kivu province. Also, it said the number of health workers sickened in the outbreak remained at 56 cases, 18 of them fatal.

[MoH press release, abridged, edited]
https://us13.campaign-archive.com/?u=89e5755d2cca4840b1af93176&id=f5a9238277

At the beginning of 2019, the Minister of Health, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, has reviewed the many challenges and achievements of the Ministry of Health in the last 2 years, from 2016 -- 2018, when the greetings ceremony with all Ministry officials.

[Sat 19 Dec 2018] marked the 2-year anniversary of Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga's appointment as Minister of Health in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Since his appointment, the Minister of Health's vision for a successful health system has remained based on 4 pillars, which were the priorities set for his mandate. These 4 pillars are:
- Improve the quality of the care supply;
- Facilitate access to care;
- Develop the industrial sector of the health sector; and
- Invest in research and development.

Beyond investments in infrastructure and medical equipment, improving the quality of healthcare provision begins with the introduction of a profound paradigm shift in the health sector. "From now on, all our actions must be guided by the constant search for rigor, efficiency and innovation" said Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga.

The Minister of Health has created the General Health Inspectorate (IGS), a regulatory institution that aims to establish the principle of accountability, the culture of results and the search for efficiency at all levels of the health pyramid.

The embryo of universal health coverage in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Governmental Program for Development of the Health System (PDSS), already covers 13 of the 26 provinces of the country and allows nearly 30 million women, children and adolescents to have access to an integrated primary health care package at an affordable cost.

According to Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, the many health crises that the country has gone through in the last 2 years have demonstrated the importance of investing in research and development to improve the nation's ability to respond.

"Two new institutions, created by the Decree of the Head of Government, will be launched in the 1st quarter of 2019. This is, on the one hand, the Ebola Center of Excellence (CEE) which will be the 1st step of the creation of a National Center for Disease Control to monitor, detect and respond to health threats.

Data as reported by: 21 Jan 2019

Situation update
----------------
The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, DRC, continues to present challenges in response, as security incidents and community resistance to response measures persist. Since our last report on 16 Jan2019, 41 additional confirmed EVD cases and 31 deaths have been reported.

From the beginning of the outbreak to 21 Jan 2019, a total of 699 EVD cases, including 650 confirmed and 49 probable cases (Table 1) were reported from 18 health zones in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri (Figure 1). A total of 13 of these health zones have ongoing active transmission, reporting at least one confirmed case in the last 21 days (1 - 21 Jan 2019). Over this period, a total of 94 confirmed and probable cases were reported, with 56% (53/94) reported from Katwa Health Zone alone. Overall, the majority of the cases occurred in urban centres and towns including Katwa (53), Butembo (12), Oicha (6), Kayna (4), Kyondo (3), Vuhovi (3), Beni (2), Biena (2), Kalunguta (2), Komanda (2), Mabalako (2), Musienene (2), and Manguredjipa (1).

Trends in case incidence reflect the continuation of the outbreak across a geographically widely dispersed area with a decline in the number of cases in Beni and increase of reported cases, especially in Katwa (Figure 1, Figure 2). As of 21 Jan 2019, a total of 433 deaths were reported, including 384 deaths among confirmed cases. The case fatality ratio among confirmed cases is 59% (384/650). Women are disproportionately affected, accounting for 62% of total reported cases. Cases among pregnant women and children younger than 1 year of age continue to be reported with a total of 29 pregnant and 18 breastfeeding women among the reported cases thus far. The total number of cases among children younger than 1 year of age is 6% (43/680) and among children older than 5 years is 15% (105/680).

The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO and partners continue to monitor and investigate all alerts in affected areas, in other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in neighbouring countries. To date, all alerts outside the outbreak affected areas have been ruled out for EVD.

2. More #Ebola news from @WHOAFRO's weekly situation report. Checkpoints on #DRC roads & at border crossings are checking the health status of huge numbers of people -- nearly 28M to date. They've found and detained 4 positive cases so far. (There are 78 points of entry/control, which led to 175 alerts, of which 82 were validated as suspect cases. - Mod.LK)

3. Two of the #Ebola cases picked up at health checkpoints on roads were heading to Goma. They were about 170 km away. The outbreak response is trying to keep Ebola out of Goma.

4. Interesting fact in this week's #Ebola situation report: There's a substantially lower death rate among cases cared for in Ebola treatment centers compared to the overall case fatality ratio for this outbreak. Still, many cases refuse to go to ETCs. (The case fatality ratio among hospitalised patients in ETCs is 38%, which is significantly lower than the overall CFR of 59%. (N.B. Women are disproportionately affected with a CFR of 62%. - Mod.LK)]

[3] Diagnostic assays and prevention

22 Jan 2019. Comment.
[Nature, abridged, edited]
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00212-y

Cnops L, De Smet B, Mbala-Kingebeni P, van Griensven J, Ahuka-Mundeke S and Ariën KK. Where are the Ebola diagnostics from last time? Nature 565: 419-421 (2019) doi: 10.1038/d41586-019-00212-y

The largest outbreak so far (from 2014 -- 2016, in West Africa) spurred companies, including Cepheid in California (1,2) and Altona in Germany (3), to develop new diagnostics. And 14 tests have been approved by either the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the World Health Organization (WHO), or both.

Yet health workers and organizations trying to stem the current outbreak cannot obtain diagnostic tests fast enough. Even when funds from international donors are available to pay for them, it is taking staff at laboratories or health centres 2 -- 8 weeks to get hold of the tests.

There are 2 types of diagnostic test for Ebola. Rapid diagnostic tests detect a viral protein; those based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) identify the virus's genomic material. By filling out company request forms, e-mailing manufacturers and searching their websites, we established that, of the recently approved tests provided by companies, only 4 are readily available to buyers (see 'What's available?'). All of these are PCR-based tests. OraSure Technologies in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, has made its rapid diagnostic test OraQuick available to the WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which are distributing the test to health workers in the current outbreak. But it is not available to other buyers.

Our analysis reveals that research and scaled-up production have been sustained for only a few of the company-provided tests that were developed and approved during the 2014-16 emergency. Indeed, we were co-developers of a diagnostic test for Ebola (4) that is no longer available because the manufacturer decided to focus exclusively on oncology.

What's available?
We questioned manufacturers and searched their websites to try to understand why health workers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are struggling to obtain diagnostics.

In our analysis, we focused on approved Ebola tests that are provided by companies; 3 tests can be obtained only from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or from US Department of Defense laboratories. We searched for the brand name of the test kit on the manufacturer's website. We filled out company request forms and e-mailed contacts at the companies to ask how many kits each provider could send. We also asked for expiry dates, costs and delivery time to our lab in Belgium. (The lab is a national reference centre for tropical infectious diseases, including Ebola, and a representative client of those companies in the European Union.)

Of the 7 PCR-based tests we investigated, only 4 were readily available -- meaning that they could be sent to our lab in less than 2 weeks. For the others, we either got no responses to our online order forms or would have needed to have waited 14 weeks (see table).

Four rapid diagnostic tests for Ebola have been approved. For undisclosed reasons, the manufacturer of one requested that it be taken off the lists of approved diagnostics in May 2018. OraQuick is available to health workers in the DRC but only through the CDC or the World Health Organization. For the remaining 2 tests, we received no response to requests, and couldn't find information on the manufacturers' websites about prices, shipping time or shelf life.

Diagnostics are fundamental to containing outbreaks. Without such tests, it is impossible to trace whether people with the disease have infected others, whether the virus persists in survivors, or to investigate the cause of deaths. In our view, the various Ebola diagnostic approaches need to be evaluated and the best ones prioritized. Most importantly, developers must be incentivized to sustain their investment in diagnostics during and after epidemics, so that health workers are not scrambling to obtain tests when the next outbreak arrives.
[...]
We think that two actions are urgently needed to improve the availability of diagnostics -- both in the current DRC Ebola outbreak and in future crises:
[1] Evaluate and prioritize specific diagnostics (...more)
[2] Incentivize developers (...more)

[This is an important article that highlights the glaring lack of rapid diagnostic tests deployable for the current DRC Ebola epidemic. Such "point-of-care" tests, which were initially developed several years ago in response to the West African Ebola epidemic, would be particularly useful in the current epidemic given the high proportion of suspect patients who are presenting in sites other than established Ebola treatment centres.

Both ELISA-based and PCR-based assays to detect viral proteins and nucleic acids, respectively, are well-established technologies that require minimal repurposing for new molecular targets. Thus, the true hurdle to their deployment in the field is not traditional R&D, but rather end-stage commercial-scale manufacturing and distribution. Adapting these standard diagnostic technologies to "orphan" tropical and infectious diseases is analogous to the business model used by IDEXX and other companies that repurposed human diagnostic tests for companion and food animals.

As pointed out in this article, which should be read in its entity, commercial incentives, public-private partnerships, and funding consortiums are key to this effort. Such approaches have led to the clinical development and actual use of novel medicines and vaccines for Ebola - diagnostic tests are another pillar of medical technology, and deserve no less. - Mod.LXL]

Drug maker Merck says it will ship another approximately 120 000 doses of an experimental Ebola vaccine to Congo by the end of next month [February 2019] amid the 2nd deadliest outbreak in history.

Associate Vice President Lydia Ogden told the World Economic Forum that the company is committed to having a ready stockpile of 300 000 doses and already has shipped 100 000 to the World Health Organization.

Health officials have called the experimental vaccine highly effective against the virus.

-Tue 22 Jan 2019. Ebola surveillance activities slowed by the lack of drinking water in Lubero
[Radio Moto Butembo-Beni, online transl, edited]
http://radiomotofm.info/lirearticle.php?billet=5328

The announcement [regarding lack of drinking water came from] the Lubero zone chief doctor this [Mon 21 Jan 2019]. This situation hampers the surveillance activities against Ebola in this country. A triage cycle is being built right at the entrance to the hospital. Beyond the washing of the hands, the hosts of the general hospital will be subjected to the checkup which will consist of the detection of the body temperature as indicated to us the chief doctor of zone. While the epidemiological surveillance is strengthened, unfortunately there has been a lack of drinking water in this health facility for 3 days. Contacted, the person in charge of the drinking water supply committee of Bumate speaks of a section [of the pipe?] which would be the cause of this situation.

[Becker's Hospital Review, abridged, edited]
https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/quality/congo-s-ebola-outbreak-could-spread-to-1-million-person-city-who-says.html
[Byline: Mackenzie Bean]

The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo is spreading toward a major population center, a World Health Organization official told Vox.

Things to know:
1. The Congo's health ministry this week confirmed 4 Ebola cases in the town of Kayina, which is halfway between Butembo -- a current hotspot for the outbreak -- and Goma, where 1 million people reside.

2. While the outbreak has not hit the country's largest cities, the new Ebola cases' proximity to Goma "raises the alarm," Peter Salama, MD, WHO's deputy director-general for emergency preparedness and response, told Vox. The organization deployed a rapid response and vaccination team to Kayina to address the new cases.
