WHO Ebola Response update no. 4, 16 Sep 2014 [numbers as of 14 Sep 2014]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview
--------
The total number of probable, confirmed, and suspected cases (see Annex 2) in the current outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa was 5335, with 2622 deaths, as at the end of 14 Sep 2014 (table 1 [available at the source URL above]). Countries affected are Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sierra Leone. Figure 1 shows the total number of cases by country that have been reported in each epidemiological week between the start of 30 December 2013 (start of epidemiological week 1) and end 14 Sep 2014 (epidemiological week 37: 8 to 14 Sep). -- more [10 pages]

The World Health Organization says more than 700 EVD cases emerged in West Africa in one week, a statistic that shows the outbreak is accelerating. Just 3 weeks ago the number of new cases was around 500 for a one-week period. The number of people believed to have been killed is now more than 2600, an increase of roughly 200 from the last estimate, WHO said Thu [18 Sep 2014]. Most deaths have been in Liberia.

The new figures from the UN health agency show that the disease is thought to have sickened more than 5300 people. [Almost] half of those cases were recorded in the last 3 weeks. Some 318 health care workers have been sickened, and about half have died.

[As WHO has repeatedly emphasized, these are provisional figures and certainly a big undercount. The Director-General of WHO told the UN Security Council on Thu 18 Sep 2014 "...these shocking figures are vast underestimates." See http://www.who.int/dg/speeches/2014/security-council-ebola/en.

[My comment: On the other hand, in the absence of testing for other causes such as Lassa fever and malaria, many of the suspected cases were quite possibly not from EVD. What the real figures are, there is no way of knowing. - Mod.JW]

USAID: The United States Agency for International Development is appealing to the medical community in the United States for assistance with the West Africa Ebola outbreak. Qualified medical professionals wishing to volunteer in West Africa can sign up at a registry. Experienced health sector workers interested in volunteering to help people affected by the West Africa Ebola outbreak are welcome to register. The information submitted may be shared with nongovernmental organizations working in the West Africa region or with the CDC. Volunteers may be contacted to confirm their interest or for Ebola Health Care Safety training at the discretion of the training organization.

[3] Risk of infection

[Dr] Kent Brantly, 33, was thrust into the international spotlight recently when he became the 1st US doctor infected with Ebola while working at a missionary hospital in Liberia. He recovered after being evacuated and treated in Atlanta [USA].

Now Brantly is working to draw more attention to the worsening outbreak in West Africa. This week [week of 15 Sep 2014], he testified on Capitol Hill and met with President Obama. He also stopped by The Washington Post, where he spoke about his experience and tried to dispel notions about the dangers of working in an EVD ward. Brantly said he suspects he got infected while treating patients in the hospital's emergency room, not while working in the EVD isolation ward...

"I have to tell you that if I had a choice of working in the isolation unit, or working in [the normal part of a] hospital during the middle of an EVD outbreak, I'd choose the isolation unit every time. ... You are provided with all the personal protective equipment you need; you know that every patient you're going to see is at least suspected of Ebola, if not confirmed to have it. But in the hospital, you have to look at every single patient and say, 'Should I think you have Ebola or not?' You can't wear that suit all day long, every day, for lots of reasons. Because it's so hot. Because you would get dehydrated. But also because it's terrifying to people..." -- more

[4] CDC: safety training courses for volunteers
Date: Fri 19 Sep 2014
Source: CDC, Ebola (Ebola virus disease), healthcare workers [edited]
http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/hcp/safety-training-course/index.html?s_cid=cs_1344


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has developed a safety training course for healthcare workers who plan to go to West Africa to treat patients in EVD units. The 3-day courses will be taught by CDC staff epidemiologists, infection preventionists, MSF staff members and other professionals; 10 course sessions are scheduled from 6 Oct [2014] to 4 Jan 2015.

Participants flying to attend the course should plan to arrive in the Atlanta, Georgia, Hartsfield-Jackson Airport, the day before the course begins before 5pm (EST) and plan to fly out of Atlanta, Georgia, the day after the course ends after 12pm (EST). Participants who plan to drive to Anniston, Alabama, should plan to arrive no later than 4pm the day before the course starts. Attendees traveling by plane will be responsible for travel to and from Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport; a shuttle between the airport and the training site will be provided. Lodging, meals and the course itself will be provided by CDC.

* Non-US citizens may need to register in advance of US citizens to allow additional time to process their registration. Please email <eocevent276@cdc.gov> for additional details.
Important note: CDC will not deploy graduates of this course to West Africa -- participants must be affiliated with another group that will deploy them.

The course will be held at the US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP) in Anniston, Alabama, a 90-minute drive from Atlanta, Georgia http://cdp.dhs.gov/. Trainees must register through CDC, not directly through FEMA. Please contact <eocevent276@cdc.gov> for a current course schedule, to request information on registration, or for other information on this course.

"What can non-medical US citizens do? There must be some activists groups forming, or something. Could you and the other moderators of ProMED-mail include some shred of hope in the form of a list of efforts and actions going on to help containment somehow?"

I replied that she should check the list of non-medical vacancies at the agencies listed above and in earlier ProMED-mail updates. But if she means in the USA, donors could offer to fund the travel of US volunteers who have been pre-accepted by sponsors to attend the free CDC safety course (details above), but aren't able to afford the fare. - Mod.JW]

Liberia: presidential guard quarantined
---------------------------------
18 Sep 2014: (New Dawn Liberia) The elite presidential guard --the Executive Protection Service [EPS], ... is the latest hit by the deadly disease; 57 of its officers and agents are currently being quarantined on suspicion of contracting the virus. Information gathered by this paper point to the fact the active EPS agents were being quarantined for attending the funeral and burial of a colleague reportedly dead as a result of the virus.

[Did they touch the body? But if a US soldier were to get EVD and die in West Africa, there could have been plenty of contacts beforehand, even though only properly protected people would have touched his body in the hospital before and after death. - Mod.JW]

[PIH is looking for one MD + 2 RNs for every 20 EVD beds, rotating every 6-8 weeks (above). If this is the standard ratio to give adequate patient care for this epidemic, it works out at 150 international staff per rotation for every 1000 EVD beds in each of the 2 countries being targeted.
