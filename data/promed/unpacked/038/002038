Indonesian teenager dies of bird flu
------------------------------------
A 15-year-old Indonesian girl has died of bird flu in Central Java, a
health official said on Wednesday [12 Nov 2008], bringing the
country's death toll from the disease to 113. The girl died last week
[7 Nov 2008] after being treated at the Doctor Karyadi hospital in
Semarang. "It has been confirmed by the Health Ministry labs," said
Agus Suryanto, the head of the medical team treating the girl.

Including the latest death, the virus has now infected 388 people in
15 countries, killing 246 of them, according to data from the World
Health Organisation (WHO). Indonesia has the highest toll of any
nation. Although bird flu remains an animal disease, experts fear
that the virus might mutate into a form easily passed from human to
human, sparking a pandemic in which case millions could die.

[The circumstances of the teenager's death and the degree of her
exposure to domestic poultry remain to be revealed. This report
brings the WHO and the Indonesian tally of human avian influenza
deaths into agreement.

Indonesia to test 17 for bird flu in Sulawesi
---------------------------------------------
A health ministry official said on Thursday [13 Nov 2008] that 17
people from the same neighbourhood in the Indonesian city of Makassar
in South Sulawesi are due to be tested for bird flu after falling
sick. Chandra Yoga Adhitama, acting director-general of communicable
disease control, said the group had been hospitalised after chickens
in the surrounding area suddenly died. "Some were hospitalised
yesterday [12 Nov 2008] and some today [13 Nov 2008]. I think it is a
precaution by our officials after chickens died there," Adhitama
said. He described the general health condition of the 17 as good and
said that blood samples had been taken and would be sent to the
health ministry laboratory in Jakarta for testing. "We are continuing
to monitor their condition," he said, adding that only 4 of the group
were adults.

Suspected cluster cases can raise concerns about rare human-to-human
transmission or that the virus might have mutated into a form that
can pass easily among people.

The country's largest known cluster of bird flu cases in humans
occurred in May 2006 in the Karo district of North Sumatra province,
where as many as 7 people in an extended family died. The World
Health Organisation (WHO) said at the time that limited
human-to-human transmission could not be ruled out but that the virus
samples from the scene did not show any significant genetic mutations.

Indonesia has the highest toll of any nation and a health official
said on Wednesday [12 Nov 2008] that a 15-year-old Indonesian girl
has died of bird flu in central Java, bringing the country's death
toll from the disease to 113.
