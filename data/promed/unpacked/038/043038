The treatment for leprosy includes dapsone but MUST include other drugs.
In most countries, a regimen proposed by WHO and called MDT (Multiple Drug
Therapy) is used with great success. This is so for both Solomon Islands
and Papua New Guinea. Dapsone should not be used alone. It is used with
one or two other drugs, depending upon the type of leprosy. MDT has been
very successful in reducing the prevalence of leprosy, though it has not
had much effect on the incidence. It is not clear that BCG has had any
impact on the epidemiology of leprosy.
While I have worked in both Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea, I have no
information other than this e-mail message [980115004946 cited above about
any possible outbreak on Bougainville. If there are cases of communicable
leprosy (some cases have little or no risk of transmission to others,) then
there is risk of transmission to Solomon Islanders who come into contact
with these individuals when there is travel between Choiseul Province
(northern part of Solomons) and Bougainville. The immunization program is
not likely to have a significant effect on this risk of transmission. The
Solomon Islands leprosy control programme should be able to provide the
necessary information to Solomon Islanders and to deal with any cases which
may result. It is important to remember that the "usual" incubation period
for leprosy is at least 2 years.

I am not sure that one can speak in terms of a leprosy "outbreak" - this is
one of the least contagious diseases of man, and has an incubation period
measured in years. The following background data on leprosy in Oceania
were extracted from the GIDEON software program:
American Samoa
13 cases were reported in 1982; 2 in 1991; 0 in 1993; 4 in 1994. Ten cases
were registered as of 1994.
Cook Islands
No active cases were registered in 1989. One case was registered as of June
1997.
Fiji
1,084 cases were registered as of 1995; 136 as of 1997. 38 new cases were
reported in 1996.
French Polynesia
Eight cases were registered as of 1994.
Guam
40 cases were reported in 1970; 31 in 1980; 1 in 1990; 5 in 1991; 4 in
1993; 11 in 1994; 7 in 1995; 0 in 1996. Twenty cases were registered as of
1994.
Kiribati
70 cases were registered as of 1994; 54 as of 1995.
Nauru
The disease prevalence is estimated at greater than 10%.
New Caledonia
505 cases were registered in 1981; 492 in 1983; 65 in 1994. 40%
Niue
Approximately one case is reported annually.
Papua New Guinea
2,755 cases were registered as of 1994; 2,167 as of 1995; 1,318 (with 231
new cases) as of 1996; 1,318 as of 1997.
Solomon Islands
43 new cases were reported in 1981. 317 cases were registered as of 1994.
Tonga
No active cases were registered in 1989. Two cases were registered as of
June 1997.
American Pacific Trust Territories
Disease prevalance was 549/100,000 in 1988. Rates are particularly high on
Truk. Three cases were reported from the Northern Marianas in 1992; 2 in
1993; 0 in 1994; 0 in 1995; 0 in 1996. As of 1994, 16 cases were registered
in the Northern Marianas. 387 ongoing cases were registered in Micronesia
in 1994; 290 in 1995; 368 (with 288 new cases) in 1996; 448 in 1997. Seven
cases were registered in Palau as of June 1997.

Tuvalu
No active cases were registered in 1989. One case was registered as of June
1997.
Vanuatu
15 cases were registered as of 1994.
Wallis and Futuna Islands
Six new cases were reported in 1981.
