Nicaragua reported four deaths from leptospirosis Saturday, a
bacteriological infection usually [waterborne via contamination with animal
urine - ES]. [Current conditions in Central America are such that it may
be] contracted by walking on damp, infected soil. It causes severe
headaches, pains in the joints, diarrhea, fever, and eventually, death.
On Saturday some 40 people who showed symptoms of leptospirosis were
airlifted to a hospital in the northern Nicaraguan town of Chinandega, from
neighboring communities where the disease had already claimed three lives,
said government epidemiologist Alvaro Ramirez.
"We are facing a disease with an explosive potential, it spreads
rapidly,"he told AFP.
Ramirez said another five cases, one of them fatal, were reported in
northwestern Nicaragua.
