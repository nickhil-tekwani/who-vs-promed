The National Health and Family Planning Commission, China notified WHO of an additional laboratory confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus. The patient is a 6 year old boy reported from Beijing who became ill on 21 May 2013 and is in a stable condition.

To date, WHO has been informed of a total of 132 laboratory confirmed cases, including 37 deaths.

Authorities in affected locations continue to maintain surveillance, epidemiological investigations, close contact tracing, clinical management, laboratory testing and sharing of samples as well as prevention and control measures. City and provincial governments have started to normalize their emergency operations into their routine surveillance and response activities.

So far, there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission.

Until the source of infection has been identified and controlled, it is expected that there will be further cases of human infection with the virus. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. WHO continues to work with member states and international partners to monitor the situation. WHO will provide updates as the situation evolves.

Health authorities in Beijing Tuesday [28 May 2013] reported a 2nd human infection of the H7N9 strain of bird flu in the Chinese capital. A 6 year old boy who lives in the Haidian district was confirmed to have been infected with the H7N9 strain on Tuesday afternoon, the Beijing municipal health bureau said in a statement.

The child developed symptoms including fever and headache on 21 May 2013, and he was sent to a hospital for medical treatment on the same day. His body temperature returned to normal on 23 May 2013, and he returned to kindergarten the next day, according to the statement.

The boy was sent to the Beijing Ditan Hospital for further medical observation after being confirmed for the H7N9 infection on Tuesday [28 May 2013]. The boy is in good condition, and his body temperature has been normal for 5 straight days, it added. The H7N9 epidemic has waned this month [May 2013] with only a few cases being confirmed.

With the latest case, China has reported 131 [132 according to WHO] confirmed H7N9 cases, and of them, 37 people have died.

[A new human case of avian influenza H7N9 has been reported in China, the 1st confirmed human case for nearly a month. Somewhat surprisingly, the case was detected in Beijing, only the 2nd case to be diagnosed in the city throughout the course of the outbreak. The patient is a child suffering only mild symptoms and apparently now recovered with no aftereffects. Surveillance in China now appears to be highly efficient. - Mod.CP
