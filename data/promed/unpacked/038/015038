If you buy Ball Park Franks, check your packages before cooking them. The
government is announcing that Ball Park Brands is voluntarily recalling 34
500 pounds of the hot dogs because they may contain the bacterium _Listeria
monocytogenes_
The recall affects Ball Park Beef Franks and Ball Park Franks made from
beef, pork, or turkey. All come in one-pound packages, and were sold in 15
states: Florida, Missouri, New York, Virginia, Ohio, Connecticut, Oklahoma,
Delaware, Kansas, Nebraska, Texas, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Massachusetts,
and Maryland.
No illnesses have been reported yet, says the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's Food Safety Inspection Service. The bacterium can cause
listeriosis. The illness won't make most people sick, but it can be
dangerous -- even deadly -- to the very young, the very old, and people
with weak immune systems. Do not even go near these franks if you're
pregnant; the bacterium can cause miscarriages and stillbirths. In late
1998 and early 1999, a [listeriosis outbreak (also from hot dogs) killed
20 people and sickened another 100.
Look for this code on the package: APR03 EST 12PAB. If you see it, return
the hot dogs to the store where you bought them -- or just toss them in the
trash. If you have questions, call the company at (800) 556-9700.
