Nearly 2 years after the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC's) longest and biggest outbreak began, the country's health officials today [Thu 25 Jun 2020] declared that the event in the eastern part of the country is over.

Having passed 2 incubation periods since the last patient was confirmed to be free of the virus, the outbreak centered in North Kivu and Ituri provinces resulted in 3470 cases, 3317 of them confirmed and 153 listed as probable. Of those, 2287 people died from their infections and 1170 survived, for a 66% case-fatality rate, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

The outbreak, which was the DRC's 10th, began on 1 Aug 2018, was the world's 2nd-largest, and began just a week after a small 11-week outbreak in the country's northwestern Equateur province was declared over. And now the event is bookended by a fresh outbreak in the same area of Equateur province.

In a statement today [Thu 25 Jun 2020], the WHO congratulated the DRC and all groups that helped end the outbreak.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said in a statement, "The outbreak took so much from all of us, especially from the people of DRC, but we came out of it with valuable lessons and valuable tools. The world is now better equipped to respond to Ebola. A vaccine has been licensed and effective treatments identified."

However, he warned about complacency, emphasizing that viruses do not take breaks and that strong surveillance is needed to detect flare-ups. The Ebola virus can linger in protected body areas of survivors, such as eyes and testes, which has been known to trigger new clusters. "Ultimately, the best defense against any outbreak is investing in a stronger health system as the foundation for universal health coverage."

As soon as the outbreak in the east was confirmed on 1Aug 2018, health officials were worried, because the cases were detected in an active conflict zone in a province that is home to about 1 million displaced people. A tumultuous presidential campaign also took place during the outbreak.

Throughout the outbreak, responders battled community mistrust over whether the virus was truly a threat and some pushback about the vaccine. Citizens in outbreak hot spots were hurt and killed in rebel attacks, which prompted even more unrest as communities felt vulnerable and lashed out with protests, some of which included attacks on the response itself.

A few months into the outbreak, attacks by armed rebel groups in Beni suspended vaccination activities and forced the evacuation of WHO staff to Goma and led other groups to also relocate their efforts. As tensions extended into 2019, armed militia group attacked clinics in other hot spots, including Butembo and Katwa. The outbreak in Butembo killed Richard Valery Mouzoko Kiboung, PhD, an epidemiologist deployed by the WHO.

As the outbreak approached its one-year mark, a few cases were detected in the North Kivu provincial capital city Goma, and with growing fears about the threat to the region, the WHO on 17 Jul 2019, declared that the DRC's outbreak was a public health emergency of international concern.

Soon after, 4 cases were detected in neighboring Uganda, all involving people who had traveled from the DRC. They never sparked further spread in that country, however.

Though the outbreak faced several tough challenges, including multiple attacks and spikes in Ebola activity following the attacks, the event is also marked by public health and scientific achievements, which included the massive deployment of the VSV-EBOV vaccine, Tedros noted. That vaccine has so far reached more than 303 000 people. Officials also launched a 2nd vaccine in the DRC, the 2-dose Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo regimen made by Johnson & Johnson.

In addition, clinical trials of 4 investigational medications cleared for compassionate use narrowed the group to 2 that stood out as more effective: an antibody cocktail from Regeneron and mAB 114, a treatment based on antibodies from an Ebola survivor.

Public health teams in the DRC also prevented the virus from spreading widely in Goma and from triggering outbreaks in neighboring countries, which was feared, given that the outbreak's epicenters weren't far from borders with Uganda, Rwanda, and South Sudan.

The 2nd-largest Ebola outbreak on record is over after nearly 2 years and more than 2200 deaths, the Democratic Republic of Congo's health minister said on Thursday [25 Jun 2020], even as a separate flare-up of the virus continued elsewhere in the country.

Despite effective use of 2 different vaccines, the health response to the epidemic was hampered by community suspicion and a patchwork of rebel groups operating near the Ugandan border.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) was initially set to announce the end of the outbreak in April [2020], but another case emerged just 3 days before the Ebola-free declaration was expected. That case restarted the 42-day period required before such a declaration can be made.

In a tweet announcing the news, WHO congratulated health workers who were involved in the "tough and often dangerous work" to end the outbreak.

Officials are now working to shut down a new flare-up of cases, which was declared on 1 Jun [2020] in the western city of Mbandaka, more than 1000 km (620 mi) away from the recently ended outbreak.

"The health ministry intends to capitalise on the lessons learned and the success factors from this long epidemic to assure the most effective response possible in Mbandaka," Eteni Longondo, DRC's health minister, told reporters.

There were 3463 cases confirmed and probable cases recorded over the course of the outbreak in eastern Congo, including 2277 deaths, Mr Longondo said.

[Thursday's [25 Jun 2020] milestone was overshadowed by the enormous health challenges still facing the vast country: the world's largest measles epidemic, the rising threat of COVID-19, and another new Ebola outbreak in the north (https://tinyurl.com/ybpzpby5). - Mod.LK]

This was Congo's 10th known outbreak of Ebola. The country is continuing to fight a separate, smaller eruption of the disease that began in the northwestern city of Mbandaka.

"It wasn't easy," Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO regional director for Africa, said of fighting the virus. "At times it seemed like a mission impossible. Ending this Ebola outbreak is a sign of hope for the region and the world, that with solidarity and science and courage and commitment, even the most challenging epidemics can be controlled." But as healthcare workers sought to contain the virus, rebel groups kept attacking Ebola treatment centers, burning vehicles and buildings. Aid agencies including the United Nations Children's Fund and Doctors Without Borders evacuated their teams and suspended medical activities.

The WHO said it had recorded 420 attacks on health facilities, resulting in 11 deaths and 86 injuries.

The spread of false information about Ebola also impeded efforts to fight the epidemic. Community members remained wary of officials and humanitarian agencies whom they believed were using the disease to kill them or profit on their backs. Many stayed away from health centers, believing the disease did not exist and complicating efforts to trace or treat it.

But experts said that learning to work with community members and understanding their needs was essential in eventually tackling the disease.

"One of the most important lessons that has been learned is the need to engage with, work with, and support communities to be knowledgeable and empowered to play their role," said Dr. Moeti of the WHO.

Technological experiments, like the building of secure "CUBE" emergency rooms, were instrumental in curbing the outbreak. The rooms' transparent walls and external plastic sleeves and gloves enabled medical teams to attend to Ebola patients without having to put on cumbersome protective gear and allowed patients to see family members without risk of contamination.

The air-conditioned chambers could be deployed within 72 hours from the initial alert of an outbreak, set up in 90 minutes and reused up to 10 times.

"We had some very difficult moments during these 2 years," said Nicolas Mouly, program manager for emergency response at the Alliance for International Medical Action, a nonprofit that developed the chambers. The end of the outbreak, he said, was "very great news."

"The Ebola repose was a victory for science," Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, said on Thursday [25 Jun 2020]. "The rapid rollout of highly effective vaccines saved lives and slowed the spread of Ebola. For the 1st time, the world now has a licensed Ebola vaccine."

Yet despite these efforts, the disease refused to go. In early April [2020], as officials counted down the 42-day incubation period to declare the outbreak over, a case emerged. And in early June [2020], a fresh outbreak flared up 750 miles away in Mbandaka, a city of 1.2 million. Six cases were initially reported, with at least 5 people dead [current case number is 18, of which 15 have been fatal. - Mod.LK]

This was announced even as Congo fought the world's largest measles outbreak, which since 2019 has infected 369 520 people and killed 6779. Congo has also reported 6213 coronavirus cases, with 142 deaths and 870 recoveries.

On Thursday [25 Jun 2020], Dr. Tedros struck a hopeful note despite the recent flare-up of the further outbreak, the country's 11th since Ebola was first identified in 1976.

"Today is a joyous occasion," he said.

[This is definitely a well-deserved victory over Ebola, thanks to the brave and hardworking healthcare staff in the DRC and NGOs, and all the other essential workers who supported the effort, even in the face of unrest and volatility. So much contributed to the success of the control effort in addition to the exceptional workers, including the vaccine, which proved highly effective, the antiviral compounds, and the new technology such as the CUBE emergency rooms. Much was learned, and one hopes those lessons will inform the battle against the other infectious agents threatening the population of the DRC.
