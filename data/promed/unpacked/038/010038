Malawi has turned to Canadian experts to help solve the mysterious deaths
of thousands of fish in Lake Malawi that has threatened the small country's
fishing industry over the past month, a government spokesman said Monday.
Malawi fisheries director, Shaibu Mapila, confirmed his department had sent
samples of the dead fish to a Canadian laboratory to determine whether they
were killed by poison or natural causes.
"We have a close working relationship with the Canadians, so we sent
samples of the dead fish the moment we started recording such massive
deaths," he said.
Mapila said government inspectors were recovering 8 kg of dead fish per km
every day on Lake Malawi's shoreline, totalling roughly 6.5 tons of dead
fish per day.
"And this is just what we can account for. The real figures are probably
more like 33 tons of dead fish per day, every day since the last week of
September," he said.
Mapila described the situation as "disastrous but manageable". Lake Malawi
is Africa's third biggest lake and one of the largest fresh water lakes in
the world.
Mapila said preliminary results of local research into the unprecedented
deaths pointed at changes in local weather patterns. He said since the
advent of El Nino and its "angry cousin" La Nina, the months of August,
September and October - which are usually very hot - have been
uncharacteristically cool. The changes had disturbed the life cycle of blue
and green algae in the lake.
He said the temperature changes in the lake water appeared to be killing
some varieties of algae, which in turn emitted toxic substances and killed
fish.
Only smaller species of fish are currently being affected by the phenomena.
