IRRADIATION OF FOODSTUFFS: A SUGGESTION (03)

I have been under the impression that the dose of irradiation needed to kill
gets greater as the form of life gets smaller, i.e., less irradiation is
needed to kill parasites than bacteria and less to kill bacteria than
viruses. I am also of the opinion that the amount of irradiation currently
permitted for use on foods is not adequate to destroy viruses. I suspect
that prions would require even greater amounts of irradiation than needed for
destruction of viruses, but have not read on this topic.
We need not over simplify the issue [by saying] that irradiation will make
the food absolutely sterile or safe.

Could I please have the source for the killing of prions by irradiation?

With the interest in prion diseases at an all time high, an older article
might stimulate some discussion.
Nature 1970 Sep 26;227(265):1341-1343. "Inactivation of the scrapie agent
by near monochromatic ultraviolet light." Latarjet R, Muel B, Haig DA,
Clarke MC, Alper T.
Perhaps the fear of CJD might be the catalyst that causes the public to
accept irradiation, if it can be proven effective against the agent that
causes BSE.

In my previous report I had inadvertently included prions in the list of
pathogens killed. Prions should not have been included. Irradiation does
not affect proteins but [does affect] DNA and RNA.
Please forgive my error.
