Gastrointestinal Anthrax after Animal-Hide Drumming Event, 2009
---------------------------------------------------------------
On 24 Dec 2009, a woman aged 24 years from New Hampshire was
confirmed to have gastrointestinal anthrax on the basis of clinical
findings and a _Bacillus anthracis_ blood culture isolate. Her
symptoms began on 5 Dec 2009. One day before symptom onset, she had
participated in a drumming event at a community organization's
building where animal-hide drums of multiple ages and origins were
played. This report describes the case and subsequent investigation,
which identified 84 persons potentially exposed to anthrax, including
those persons at the drumming event and those who lived or worked at
the event site.

Review of New Hampshire disease surveillance data and clinical
microbiology records for periods before and after the event
identified no additional anthrax cases. Initial qualitative
environmental testing of the event site yielded 3 positive samples (2
from drum heads and one composite sample of three electrical outlets
in the main drumming room). Wider, targeted, semi-quantitative
environmental testing of the site and additional drums yielded six
positive samples (2 from one drum and 4 from environmental locations
in the building). These results suggested that aerosolization of
spores from drumheads had occurred. All isolates obtained from
environmental and drum samples matched the patient's isolate by
multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis using 8 loci
(MLVA-8). Public health agencies and persons with exposure to
animal-hide drums should be aware of the potential, although remote,
risk for anthrax exposure associated with these drums.

The patient was a woman aged 24 years from New Hampshire, previously
in good health. On 4 Dec 2009 she participated in a public "drumming
circle" inside a community organization's building. These drumming
circles typically involved 30-40 persons from the local community
sitting in a circle and drumming or dancing. They occurred monthly
and lasted approximately 2 hours. Many attendees brought their own
drums, although the community organization had dozens of drums stored
in the basement for use during these events.

A total of 72 persons attended the 4 Dec 2009 event, and a total of
59 drums were present, including 17 drums that participants brought
from home. Volunteers set up drums and prepared a vegetarian meal;
participants ate dinner in the main drumming room before beginning
the drumming circle, which lasted 2 hours.

The next day, 5 Dec 2009, the patient had the onset of influenza-like
symptoms, with fever, diaphoresis, and myalgias. Over the next
several days, she noted increasing head, neck, and back pain but did
not seek medical care. On 12 Dec 2009, she developed worsening
nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps with dizziness. On 14 Dec
2009, she went to a local walk-in clinic and was transported
immediately to a nearby hospital emergency department. There, she
complained of vomiting, lower abdominal tenderness that radiated
posteriorly, "hunger pains," and minimally productive cough, but
reported not having diarrhea, shortness of breath, pleuritic pain,
dysuria, vaginal bleeding, or foreign travel.

Physical examination revealed orthostasis, mild tachycardia, and
costovertebral tenderness, but no fever. Abdominal examination showed
distension, but active bowel sounds and no tenderness. Laboratory
testing indicated a white blood cell count of 43,000/mm 3 (normal:
3,900--11,000/mm3) with 68 percent neutrophils, a hematocrit of 62
percent (normal: 34-46 percent), slight hyponatremia (133 mEq/L
[normal: 134--146 mEq/L]), and a blood urea nitrogen of 31 mg/dL
(normal: 6--26 mg/dL) with normal creatinine (1.0 mg/dL).

She was admitted to the hospital, blood cultures were obtained, and
she was treated with ertapenem. Chest radiograph showed lungs well
aerated bilaterally, with no infiltrates. Abdominal computed
tomography revealed massive ascites, 2 edematous small bowel segments
with highly irregular appearance, and multiple prominent
retroperitoneal lymph nodes. She was taken for exploratory
laparotomy, followed by a partial bowel resection. After surgery she
was stabilized, and, the next day, transferred to a referral
hospital. Later review of the bowel pathology by CDC demonstrated a
nematode (_Enterobius vermicularis_) infection of the small intestine
and appendix.

While the patient recovered at the referral hospital, on 24 Dec 2009,
the diagnosis of gastrointestinal anthrax was made when the
Massachusetts Department of Public Health identified gram-positive
rods from 2 Dec 2009 15 blood cultures as )B. anthracis_. The
department informed the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human
Services (NHDHHS), CDC, and, as a matter of routine, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation. NHDHHS notified surrounding states and began
an epidemiologic investigation into the source of this infection on
24 Dec 2009.

Because the patient was too ill to be interviewed, investigators
interviewed her family and friends and later corroborated information
with the patient after she was extubated on 4 Jan 2010. She was vegan
and had participated occasionally in organic farming, most recently
in September 2009. She had attended the drumming event on 4 Dec 2009,
but had not participated in any previous such events. At the event,
she drank bottled water she had brought from home and ate bagged
bread that had been donated by a local bakery. She brought her own
synthetic-head drum but also played one animal-hide drum, which, in a
subsequent interview, she was not able to identify.

To identify other anthrax cases, NHDHHS queried statewide
surveillance systems (Automated Hospital Emergency Department Data
System and Vital Records Death Data) for clinical syndromes
compatible with anthrax* for the period 1 Oct 2009 through 3 Feb
2010. Clinical microbiology laboratories in the New Hampshire
Laboratory Response Network (LRN) were asked to review all
gram-positive rod isolates from 1 Oct 2009 through 26 Dec 2009.
Neither search identified additional cases.

On 26 Dec 2009, NHDHHS investigators performed an initial qualitative
environmental sampling at the event site for the presence of _B.
anthracis_ spores. A total of 54 drums were sampled, one sample from
each of 35 drums and 2 composite samples from 7 drums, all from the
site building's basement. In addition, samples were collected from 2
drums at the patient's home (the patient's synthetic drum and her
mother's animal-hide drum, both used at the event) and 10 drums from
a community member. Also, 6 environmental samples were collected from
the event site. All samples were tested for _B. anthracis_ at the New
Hampshire Public Health Laboratory (NHPHL) using LRN protocol.

Three samples from the event site grew B. anthracis (2 from drums and
one from a composite sample of 3 electrical outlets in the room where
the drumming circle took place) [see the source URL for the Table].
The patient denied direct contact with either of the contaminated
drums during the event. One of the positive drums, estimated to be
10--15 years old, was made of cowhide, with hair on the top and
bottom surfaces. It was nearly 3 feet tall, had been purchased 3--4
years earlier at an estate sale, and was thought to have been
manufactured in Mali. It was meant to be played with mallets and had
been stored in the basement since 2007. During 2007--2009, it was
played approximately once a month. The 2nd contaminated drum was a
much smaller, tambourine-like drum (6 inches in diameter and 2 inches
wide) that had been bought at an antique shop 12--15 years earlier,
stored in the basement for the preceding 9 years, and was played only
rarely. Neither of these drums had been repair!
ed or altered since they were acquired. Investigators quarantined the
event site on 28 Dec 2009.

_B. anthracis_ isolates from the patient, drums, and environment were
sent to CDC for genotyping using MLVA-8. They were identical and
mapped within cluster A1.a (1), with a combination of alleles that
was unique in the CDC database.

The epidemiologic investigation of persons associated with the
drumming event began 28 Dec 2009. NHDHHS attempted to contact all 210
persons considered potentially associated with the event (168 guests,
4 workers, 28 volunteers, 8 residents, and 2 overnight guests). Of
these 210 persons, 23 did not respond and 187 were interviewed. Of
the 187 persons interviewed, 84 were considered potentially exposed
(i.e., being at the event, setting up just before the event, or
living or working at the event site) and were offered postexposure
prophylaxis (PEP) for anthrax, consisting of antimicrobial agents
(oral doxycycline or ciprofloxacin for 60 days from last potential
respiratory exposure) and anthrax vaccine adsorbed, the latter under
an investigational new drug (IND) protocol.**

Of the 84 persons offered PEP, one (1 percent) accepted antibiotics
and vaccine, 36 (43 percent) accepted antibiotics, 26 (31 percent)
declined, and 21 (25 percent) were lost to follow-up.

The New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services, the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, and CDC's National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health collaborated to develop and conduct
wider, targeted, semi-quantitative environmental testing that would
provide B. anthracis spore surface contamination data to characterize
the extent and type of contamination (i.e., by surface contact or
potential aerosolization). On 7-8 Jan 2010, samples were taken from
drums with previous positive results plus untested drums from the
community that had been used at the event (i.e., persons brought
their drums in to be tested) and the event site.

NHPHL consulted and collaborated with New York City, Connecticut,
Virginia, and Tennessee LRN laboratories to process and test 86
samples. The LRN environmental procedure used was semi-quantitative
(i.e., it determined colony counts to assess heavy versus light
bacterial load). Traditional microbiologic culture methods were
performed, followed by confirmatory polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
testing on suspicious colonies. The results of final testing revealed
six positive samples from the event site [see the source URL for the
Table and Figure]. MLVA-8 genotyping of all B. anthracis isolates
from final testing matched previous isolates.

The patient was discharged from the hospital after nearly 2 months
and was doing well at the time of this report. The community
building, site of the drumming event, underwent remediation ***
during which the 2 drums with positive results were properly disposed
of. All drums with a result of "none detected" were returned to their
owners, and the community building was reopened in April 2010.

MMWR Editorial Note
--------------
The anthrax case described in this report is the 1st related to
animal-hide drum exposures to involve the gastrointestinal form of
the disease. The investigation suggests that the patient was exposed
to _B. anthracis_ spores aerosolized at the drumming event, which did
not result in inhalation anthrax but did result in gastrointestinal
anthrax. Infection through the gastrointestinal route might have
occurred through direct aerosol exposure; animal studies have
demonstrated that most inhaled spores are cleared from the
respiratory tract and passed into the gastrointestinal tract (2).

Additionally, intestinal lesions have been described in inhalation
animal model studies (2). Alternatively, the patient could have
consumed food or water contaminated with spores by aerosol, or
through contact with persons who previously handled contaminated
items. Environmental sampling results suggested that other persons
present likely were exposed; however, no other anthrax cases were
identified through follow-up with attendees of the drumming event or
statewide surveillance systems review.

Gastrointestinal anthrax cases and exposures have been reported only
rarely in the United States, including a case with both cutaneous and
gastrointestinal involvement related to industrial exposure (3), and
exposure through ingestion of contaminated meat from an animal with
anthrax (4). Recent inhalation and cutaneous anthrax cases have
occurred in drum makers working with animal hides contaminated with
_B. anthracis_ spores, including a 2006 inhalation anthrax case in
New York City (5), cutaneous anthrax cases in 2007 in Connecticut
(6), and a 2008 inhalation anthrax case in England (7).

Widespread spore contamination was detected in the New York City and
Connecticut drum makers' workspaces, with secondary contamination of
their residences (5,6). In the English case, only one drum and 2
animal-hide pieces were contaminated (7). In 2006, a Scottish man
died of inhalation anthrax after exposure to contaminated drums at a
drumming workshop. Spores were detected at the workshop site, but his
was the only anthrax case among the participants, and his history of
acute myeloid leukemia in remission might have contributed to his
disease.****

The patient described in this report was the only person exposed at
the drumming event who is known to have become ill. Whether
underlying immunologic factors were present or her Enterobius
infection contributed through mucosal injury remains unclear. Her
case and the 2006 Scottish case might represent persons with unique
susceptibilities to _B. anthracis_. She developed anthrax after
exposure to environments with neither widespread nor a high level of
contamination detected. Notably, the drums used at the event had long
histories of use by other persons who were not known to develop
anthrax.

Other published reports of anthrax exist in persons for whom
documented exposure was brief or to a low level of contamination. In
some instances, like the case described in this report, several
persons were exposed to either the same contaminated environments or
articles, but did not acquire disease (8). The oral infectious dose
for gastrointestinal anthrax in humans is not known. Whereas oral
minimum ID50 dose estimates in humans or animal models range up to
1011 spores, the infectious dose by any route at which a small
proportion of the population will be infected is much lower; for
inhalation anthrax the ID2 might be as low as 9 to 2300 spores (8,9).

The risk for infection posed by handling animal-hide drums, or
attending events where such drums are played, is difficult to
quantify. Drumming circles are common activities, and given the
extreme rarity of cases like the one reported here, the risk for
infection must be considered to be very low. Because of livestock
management practices and inspection at U.S. animal processing plants,
animal hides originating in the United States are less likely to be
contaminated with _B. anthracis_ than hides or drums imported from
areas of epizootic anthrax (7).

Physicians treating patients with symptoms compatible with anthrax,
such as unexplained fever, skin lesions, or serious respiratory or
gastrointestinal illness, should be aware of the possible connection
to animal-hide drums. When unknown gram-positive bacilli are detected
in patients with illnesses consistent with _B. anthracis_ infection,
the health-care provider should be notified immediately, and
health-care providers, laboratorians, and public health officials
should ensure that a definitive diagnosis is reached promptly.

[The full article is well worth reading. It is clear that there had
been many previous exposures to the 2 contaminated drums, fortunately
without cases until this 24-year-old woman attended for the 1st time.
It would be interesting to know if she had any other contributory
factors for infection other than her _Enterobius vermicularis_
parasite. It is strange that both drums appear to have the same
genotype but the analysis only involved a MLVA-8 analysis -- most
laboratories now use a 25 primer analysis.

Without knowing its neighbours one cannot comment on the singular
A1.a result, but this group is usually seen from Kazakhstan to
southern Europe to the US and Canada; West Africa genotypes have yet
to be characterised and mapped. Of course the positive drum and
tambourine may well have been re-headed with (a) contaminated hide(s)
since 1st purchased to explain their coincidental genotype, though
the report notes that "neither of these drums had been repaired or
altered since they were acquired". The Massachusetts Department of
Public Health Laboratory is to be congratulated on their astuteness
in identifying the pathogen. - Mod.MHJ]
