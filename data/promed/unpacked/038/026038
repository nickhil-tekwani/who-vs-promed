Highly pathogenic avian influenza in Canada, follow-up report No. 3
-------------------------------------------
See also: 2 Apr 2004 (Disease Information 2004; 17[14]: 98, 2 Apr refers up
to 25 Mar 2004 ), 19 and 12 Mar 2004, also emergency report and follow-up
reports No. 1-6 on avian influenza in Canada.
Information received on 5 Apr 2004 (refers up to 4 Apr 2004) from Dr Brian
Evans, executive director, Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), Ottawa.
There are a total of 18 infected (influenza A) commercial premises
identified to date:
12 in the high-risk region,
4 in the surveillance region,
2 outside the surveillance region but within the control area.
In addition, 3 backyard flocks have also tested positive in the high-risk
region. A 3rd premises outside the surveillance region is also under
quarantine for suspicion of infection. Tracing on all infected premises is
under way.
Control measures:
Movement restrictions in British Columbia's Fraser Valley apply to a
control area which encompasses an approximate 5 km high-risk region and an
approximate 10 km surveillance region surrounding the high-risk region. The
risk levels vary within each of these 3 areas, and movement restrictions
are adjusted accordingly. Road blocks and disinfection stations have been
established to secure the high-risk region.
All flocks in the high-risk region have been ordered destroyed. The birds
from farms considered non-infected are disposed of by rendering. All birds
from farms confirmed infected are being incinerated. In total, over 365 000
birds will have been destroyed when the task is completed.
To assist in the control of the spread of the disease, all flocks in the
control area testing positive for avian influenza will now be depopulated
rather than waiting for confirmation of the H7 strain.
The 6 flocks confirmed infected outside the high-risk region (4 premises in
the surveillance region and 2 premises outside the surveillance region but
within the control area) have been quarantined. A 3rd flock outside the
surveillance region is also under quarantine for suspicion of infection.
Typing and pathogenicity indices are pending. Depopulation and disposal
efforts are under way. Infected premises in the high-risk region were not
individually quarantined, as the whole region itself is technically under
quarantine.
An emergency operations center was quickly established in British Columbia
to deal with the response operations. A National Emergency Coordination
Center is in place at the CFIA headquarters in Ottawa to deal with
policies, national communications, and various aspects of national importance.
The CFIA is working closely with the Public Safety and Emergency
Preparedness Canada, Health Canada, the British Columbia Provincial
Emergency Program, stakeholder groups, and other provincial and municipal
emergency representatives to control and monitor all aspects of the situation.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza in Canada: follow-up report No. 4
-------------------------------------------
See also: report above, 2 Apr 2004, 19 and 12 Mar 2004, also emergency
report and follow-up reports No. 1-7 on avian influenza in Canada.
Information received on 7 Apr 2004 (refers up to 6 Apr) from Dr Brian
Evans, Executive Director, Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), Ottawa.
On 5 Apr 2004, in an effort to eradicate avian influenza, the minister of
agriculture and agri-food and the minister responsible for the CFIA
announced the depopulation of all commercial poultry flocks and other
backyard birds in the control area established on 11 Mar in British
Columbia's Fraser Valley. About 19 million birds will be destroyed. Poultry
from non-infected flocks will be allowed to be processed under full
inspection in registered establishments and made available for sale. All
farm owners whose birds are ordered destroyed will be compensated under the
Health of Animals Act. The boundaries of the high-risk region and the
surveillance region are being re-evaluated.
2 more farms were confirmed positive on 6 Apr, which brings the total to 20
infected commercial premises: 13 in the high-risk region, 5 in the
surveillance region, and 2 outside the surveillance region but inside the
control area. Updates are available on the CFIA website.

[The distribution of infected farms across the different regions:
high-risk, surveillance, and outside the surveillance but inside the
control region, suggests a wide cull policy is appropriate. It is
unfortunate that previous culling strategies did not stop the disease
progression, but we hope the net is cast widely enough this time.
It is important to remember that sometimes geographic influence is not the
only important connection between infected flocks. In the AI outbreak in
Virginia in the spring of 2002, commercial connections such as receiving
deliveries or being part of a common corporate ownership structure was a
critical risk factor. - Mod.PC]
