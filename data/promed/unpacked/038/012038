----------------------------------------------------------------------
Lethal wilt, a severe disease of oil palm, is spreading throughout South America. An incidence of about 30 percent was recorded in 4 commercial fields in Colombia.

Phytoplasmas were detected in symptomatic oil palms by using specific primers, based on 16S rDNA sequences, in nested polymerase chain reaction [PCR] assays. The phytoplasmas were then identified as _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma asteris, ribosomal subgroup 16SrI-B, through the use of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and sequencing. Cloning and sequencing of 16S rDNA from selected strains, together with phylogenetic analysis, confirmed the classification.

Moreover, collective RFLP characterization of the groEL, amp, and rp genes, together with sequence data, distinguished the aster yellows strain detected in Colombian oil palm samples from other aster yellows phytoplasmas used as reference strains, in particular from an aster yellows strain infecting corn [see comment below] in the same country.

[Lethal wilt ('marchitez letal' in Spanish) is a new infectious disease of oil palm that has been reported in eastern Colombia. It appears to be spreading and has led to a national yield decline of about 10 percent over the last 10 years. Close to 100 000 affected palms have been removed. Symptoms may include vascular discolouration, leaf yellowing, leaf and root necrosis, wilting of fronds, and death of the tree usually within 4 to 6 months of the onset of symptoms.

Aster yellows phytoplasma (_Candidatus_ Phytoplasma asteris [_Ca._ P.a.], 16SrI-B taxonomic group) is one of the most diverse phytoplasmas known. It causes or is involved in around 100 serious crop diseases and can infect over 300 host species including a wide variety of broadleaf (dicotyledonous) crops such as oilseed rape, potato ("purple top"), grapevine, lucerne, and some vegetables. _Ca._ P.a. is also associated with a number of important diseases of monocots, for example, as the cause of maize bushy stunt, which may be the disease referred to above, and as a coinfection with other phytoplasmas in both Al-Wijam disease of date palm (see ProMED-mail posts 20070514.1536 and 20110519.1512) and yellowing diseases of coconut and other palms in Malaysia (see link below).

Ornamentals and weeds can serve as pathogen reservoirs. _Ca._ P.a. can overwinter in the living crowns of perennials. It can be transmitted by grafting or with cutting instruments (for commercial oil palm possibly during harvest of fruit bunches or frond pruning), but not in soil or by seed. The main vectors appear to be the aster leafhopper (_Macrosteles quadrilineatus_) and related species. Insects remain infectious for life. The pathogen may be present in host species at very low levels; however, the level can increase under favourable conditions resulting in an outbreak with potential crop losses. Disease management in field crops may include vector control and removal of weeds serving as pathogen and/or vector reservoirs. For woody hosts, clean planting and/or grafting material and good plant hygiene practices are most important.
