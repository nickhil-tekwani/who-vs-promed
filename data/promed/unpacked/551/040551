Abstract
The Powassan virus is the arthropod-borne pathogen responsible for Powassan neuroinvasive disease. The virus was 1st isolated in 1958 and has been responsible for approximately 100 cases of neuroinvasive disease. Rates of infection have been on the rise over the past decade with numerous states reporting their 1st confirmed case; New Jersey, New Hampshire and Connecticut all reported their 1st case within the last 5 years. We present here the 1st confirmed case of Powassan neuroinvasive disease in the nearby state of Rhode Island [in April 2016 - CopyEd.MSP]. A previously healthy 81-year-old female with known tick exposure presented with fever, altered sensorium, seizures and focal neurological deficits. After an extensive work-up that was largely unrevealing Powassan encephalitis was suspected. The diagnosis was confirmed with serological testing consisting of Powassan IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Powassan plaque reduction neutralization testing. The case study provides evidence for the increasing spread of Powassan neuroinvasive disease and reinforces the importance of requesting focused testing for Powassan virus in patients from an endemic area with a clinically compatible syndrome.

Conclusion
The past decade has seen an increase in the reported cases of Powassan neuroinvasive disease. Over the same period there has been a notable increase in seroconversion among POWV's white tailed deer reservoir, potentially explaining at least a part of this difference. The increase in incidence of Powassan neuroinvasive disease in number and across state lines underscores the importance of requesting focused testing for POWV beyond that offered by standard arbovirus panels in suggestive patients. Once infection is underway, treatment is largely supportive, highlighting the importance of prevention.

[Powassan virus (POWV) is being detected in an expanding area of the Northeastern and Upper Midwestern states in the USA. Although ProMED-mail would not normally post a POW case that occurred over 2 years ago, Rhode Island is a new state on the POW virus geographic distribution list. A previous ProMED-mail post (Powassan virus encephalitis - USA (05) 20170713.5173071) stated that Powassan virus (POWV, Flaviviridae) is the only North American member of the tick-borne encephalitis serogroup of flaviviruses. It is transmitted to small- and medium-sized mammals by _Ixodes scapularis_, _Ixodes cookei_, and several other _Ixodes_ tick species.

Humans become infected with POWV during spillover transmission from the natural transmission cycles. In humans, POWV is the causative agent of a severe neuroinvasive illness with 50 percent of survivors displaying long-term neurological sequelae. POWV was recognized as a human pathogen in 1958 when a young boy died of severe encephalitis in Powassan, Ontario, Canada. There are 2 distinct genetic lineages of POWV now recognized: POWV (lineage I) and blacklegged tick virus (lineage II). Since the index case in 1958, over 100 human cases of POWV have been reported, with an apparent rise in disease incidence in the past 16 years. This recent increase in cases may represent a true emergence of POWV in regions where the tick vector species are prevalent, or it could represent an increase in POWV surveillance and diagnosis. In the past 5 years, both basic and applied research for POWV disease has intensified, including phylogenetic studies, field surveillance, case studies, and animal model development. - Mod.TY
