The West Nile virus (WNV), which can cause meningitis in humans, has
reached Austria, a virologist said Friday [13 Feb 2009] in Vienna.
Birds carrying the virus were detected in Austria for the 1st time
last year, Norbert Nowotny, a professor at the Vienna University of
Veterinary Medicine, told Austrian press agency APA.

The disease was imported from Hungary last summer [2008], but only
birds in eastern Austria fell ill. No humans were infected by the
disease which is spread by mosquitos. In the United States, some 10
000 people were infected with a more aggressive strain of the virus
in the past years, causing around 1000 deaths.

West Nile fever reached Hungary in 2004, but the disease "exploded"
last summer [2008], Nowotny said. "The illness spread in all of
Hungary, in birds, especially goshawks, and horses. Around 20 people
fell ill as well," the scientist said, noting that they suffered from
mild meningitis, but that no one had died.

[WNV infections continued to occur in southern Europe in 2008. It is
not surprising that WNV has been identified in birds in Austria, the
most recent cases having occurred in adjoining countries Hungary and
Italy in 2008 (see ProMED archives listed below). There is no mention
in this report if horses have been infected in Austria. It will be
interesting to see what happens with WN virus transmission in these
countries in 2009.
