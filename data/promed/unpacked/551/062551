Pennsylvania Health Secretary Robert S. Zimmerman Jr. today announced that
the state is finalizing plans to monitor the state for potential mosquito
and animal carriers of the West Nile virus that struck New York City last
year. "We want to be sure we are prepared if this virus crosses the
Pennsylvania state line," Secretary Zimmerman said. "We are developing an
aggressive plan to monitor, test and control the species of mosquitoes that
carries the virus, and to educate Pennsylvanians on easy steps they can
take to protect themselves."
Although the West Nile virus has not been found in Pennsylvania, the state
wants to be ready in case the virus spreads into the state this summer.
Governor Tom Ridge's 2000-01 budget proposes $9.8 million in new funding to
prevent and mitigate the potential public-health effects of West Nile virus
on citizens of the Commonwealth. The funds will provide necessary staffing
and an improved epidemiological infrastructure to detect the virus should
it find its way into Pennsylvania.
The departments of Health, Environmental Protection, Aging, and
Conservation and Natural Resources, and the Fish and Boat and Game
commissions currently are working on a comprehensive, statewide plan to try
to prevent a virus outbreak in Pennsylvania. "We learned from other states
last summer that we need to be ready to respond if the virus is found to
help prevent it from spreading," Department of Environmental Protection
Secretary James M. Seif said. "The state's plan will include testing animal
populations that may act as a host for the virus and monitoring public
health to provide early warning of virus infections."
DEP [Department of Environmental Protection] has been charged with the
mosquito surveillance and control portion of the multi-agency effort to
control disease outbreaks in Pennsylvania. The seven agencies will work
together and with local governments to implement the comprehensive
surveillance and control program, which will include mosquito surveillance
and monitoring. Birds, chickens and horses, potential hosts for the virus,
will be monitored and tested. If the virus is detected, the control program
will be implemented to kill the infected mosquitoes.
