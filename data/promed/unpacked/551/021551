The handling of the bird flu outbreak has come under fire, as it
emerged that vaccinations for poultry workers will not be completed
for another 2 months. The workers in Suffolk, where the [highly
pathogenic H5N1] virus has been found in turkeys, have been offered
anti-viral drugs in case they contract avian flu.

But they should also have been vaccinated against human flu, because
officials fear that the 2 viruses could mix if caught by one person
at the same time, and this could spark a pandemic [in humans]. Yet
few poultry workers have so far received jabs, even though the flu
season can begin as early as October.

Suffolk Primary Care Trust, which covers the infected farm, said it
expected to have vaccinated the workers by January [2008]. But Dr
Graeme Laver, an influenza virologist, said: "January is far too
late."

[In the absence of a generally available H5N1 vaccine approved for
use in the human population, the intention of vaccination of poultry
workers exposed to diseased poultry is to reduce their risk of being
simultaneously infected by the avian H5N1 virus and one of the
current seasonal strains of human influenza virus circulating in the
general population. Conceptually, a new human pandemic strain could
arise by the reassortment of genome sub-units during replication in a
co-infected host. (However, it is becoming incumbent upon influenza
virologists to establish why this has not occurred already elsewhere).

According to the EISS (European Influenza Surveillance Scheme),
seasonal influenza activity in Europe is low at present. Currently in
Europe, influenza activity remains at the low at levels normally seen
outside the seasonal influenza peak period, with 28 countries
reporting no or only sporadic influenza activity during the current
week. There has been no significant change in influenza activity
since the start of the 2007-2008 winter period in week 40/2007, and,
so far, only a few laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza have been
reported across Europe
<http://www.eiss.org/cgi-files/bulletin_v2.cgi?display=1&code=240&bulletin=240>.

The low level of seasonal influenza in England at the present time
suggests that the risk of co-infection and consequent generation of a
novel pandemic strain of influenza virus is low. Furthermore, the
fact that vaccination against seasonal influenza is already in
progress throughout the general community in the UK may have
dissuaded the medical authorities from reallocating vaccine stocks
for this purpose. Furthermore, post-exposure vaccination would have
limited efficacy, as it would have been administered too late to
reduce markedly the risk of co-infection

It would be prudent, however, in view of the recent H5N1 outbreaks in
Europe, to allocate vaccine to all workers in the poultry industry to
eliminate the potential risk associated with co-infection. - Mod.CP]
