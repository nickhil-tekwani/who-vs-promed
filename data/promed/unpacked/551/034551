[1] Brazil (Sao Luis de Montes Belos, Goias state): primates, suspected

In the past week 2 monkeys were found dead in a municipality near Sao Luis de Montes Belos. Since these animals are the main hosts of yellow fever virus, FUNASA (Fundacao Nacional de Saude; National Health Foundation) of that municipality is mobilized to bring the populace to health posts to receive the vaccine against the virus.

The animals were found dead in a farm about 70 km (44 mi) from Sao Luis and the cadavers were sent for tests to confirm if the animals died due to yellow fever virus.

The municipal chief of Endemics of Sao Luis municipality, Saides Viana, said that the populace can go to a health post and be vaccinated now while awaiting the results of the test results on the bodies of the monkeys. It is good to prevent possible complications due to the virus. The yellow fever [virus] is not transmitted person-to-person directly. For transmission to occur, it is necessary that a mosquito bite an infected person, and after the virus replicates [in the mosquito] it bites an individual who has not had the disease and has not been vaccinated [non-immune]. Human infection also occurs when a non-immunized person goes into savannas or forests [where non-human primates and mosquito vectors are present].

[Surveillance of epizootics is one of the principal pillars in the surveillance of yellow fever. When epizootics occur, they must be considered as a potential sentinel event (suggesting virus circulation), which can, eventually, precede occurrence of yellow fever cases in humans in a given location. For this reason, they must always be investigated to support decisions taken such as recommendation for vaccination of the [human] population that resides there or of individuals who move into the area in question.

To become familiar with the (excellent) Manual de Vigilancia de Epizootias em Primatas Nao-Humanos [Manual for Surveillance of Epizootics in Non-Human Primates] of the Ministry of Health of Brazil see http://portal.saude.gov.br/portal/arquivos/pdf/epizootias.pdf.

To become acquainted with a map of the distribution of epizootics investigated in Brazil see http://portal.saude.gov.br/portal/saude/profissional/visualizar_texto.cfm?idtxt=37357&janela=1. - Mod.RNA

If these monkeys are shown to have died of a yellow fever [YF] virus infection, they were part of the sylvan (jungle) cycle of virus transmission. Vaccination of the local human population is prudent to avoid establishment of an urban cycle of transmission of the virus, or additional human cases due to sylvan YF virus transmission, as the test results are awaited. Increased, proactive surveillance of wild non-human primates to detect additional cases in the area would also be advisable, as Mod.RNA mentions above.

The director of epidemiology, emergencies and disasters of the Regional Health Office of Ayacucho (DIRESA), Amelia Cabrera Sanchez, confirmed the 1st [human] death with a clinical picture of yellow fever this year [2012]. The occurrence was registered in the San Francisco Hospital located in the Valley of the Apurimac and Ene Rivers (VRAE).

According to the report of the epidemiological unit, the case occurred in the Kempiri-Rio Tambo, Ene area, health center, in a local 28 year old who presented with headache and had a yellow body color. Given these symptoms, the patient was sent to the San Francisco Hospital where he could only be attended to for a few minutes before he died without anyone being able to do anything for him.

The area health personnel sent samples from the patient to the Ayacucho Regional Hospital, which confirmed the death due to yellow fever [virus infection].

This situation has motivated the initiation of preventive actions, diagnosis, and timely treatment of this type of disease that can cause new victims in the region. "Currently, necessary steps are being taken that, in coordination with the health centers, will involve searches for cases with similar clinical pictures along the areas where the deceased person traveled," explained Amelia Cabrera to InfoRegion. The official said that the San Francisco health network is undertaking preventive action-education activities, such as diagnosis and timely treatment of patients in [YF] endemic areas such as Sivia, Llochegua, and Ayna.

[The ecological setting where this confirmed case acquired his yellow fever virus infection is not stated, although the general area has extensive tropical forest where the endemic YF virus sylvan (jungle) transmission cycle occurs. Although early diagnosis and treatment are desirable, prevention through vaccination would be important, although not mentioned in the report above. Surveillance for dead or ill non-human primates, as indicators of transmission in the area, would also be useful.
