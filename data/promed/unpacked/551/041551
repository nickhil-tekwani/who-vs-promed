A rare and "nasty" virus that targets young children has been found for the 1st time in New Zealand.

An Environmental Science Research (ESR) team was investigating an outbreak of gastroenteritis, to find out which virus caused it, when they stumbled across the virus, know as human parechovirus (HPeV3).

ESR's Dr Richard Hall said the virus was found in a sample of faeces from a 2-year-old child in 2012, who was ill during a gastro outbreak at a childcare centre.

Hall said the virus can trigger potentially fatal diseases in young children and babies, including blood infections and inflammation of the brain. "It can affect different tissue types in the body, such as the membranes surrounding the brain, but there's still a lot that we don't know about it," he said.

HPeV3 was first identified in Japan in 2004 but until recently only one other case in Bolivia had been reported.

However, it has increasingly raised its head and last year [2014] was behind an outbreak of blood infection among children in Australia.

Testing for the virus, which already occurs in the US, Japan, and Europe, should now be considered in New Zealand, he said. "Especially for rare cases of severe disease that can't be explained."

The findings were published in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology this week.

A nasty virus which mainly affects babies and can cause more severe, potentially fatal diseases has been confirmed for the 1st time in New Zealand.

A team from the Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR), dubbed the "virus hunters", detected human parechovirus 3 (HPeV3) from a faecal sample taken from 2-year-old who became sick during a gastro outbreak at a childcare facility in 2012.

The findings, made as part of a Health Research Council-funded study delving into unsolved outbreaks of human gastroenteritis, have been published in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology.

HPeV3 was first discovered in Japan in 2004. Last year [2014] it caused a significant outbreak of sepsis, or infection of the blood, in babies in Australia.

Dr Richard Hall, who confirmed the virus, said HPeV3 mainly infected babies and young children and often caused no symptoms. However, it was also known to cause more severe diseases which could be fatal, including blood infections in newborn babies, acute inflammation of the brain, and even paralysis.

It was not clear if HPeV3 was the cause of the 2012 outbreak, but the Ministry of Health and the medical officer of health from the district health board where the patient resided were notified about the finding.

"The HPeV3 virus survives in the body for only a short time, maybe a few weeks, and is thought to be spread through the faecal-oral route," Dr Hall said.

"It can affect different tissue types in the body, such as the membranes surrounding the brain, but there's still a lot that we don't know about it."

The ESR team wanted to make clinicians and public health authorities aware of the presence of HPeV3 due to the serious illnesses associated with its infection.

"We suggest they consider testing for HPeV3 as is carried out in the US, Japan, and Europe, and more recently in Australia, especially for rare cases of severe disease that can't be explained," Dr Hall said.

The development of any future diagnostic tests would be put together by ESR, the Ministry of Health, and DHB labs.

[According to the media release on the web page of the Health Research Council of New Zealand (http://www.hrc.govt.nz/news-and-publications/news-media#nz%27s-%27virus-hunters%27-make-new-discovery), this study provides the 1st report of human parechovirus type 3 (HPeV3) detection in New Zealand.

The Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR) team made the discovery as part of a Health Research Council of New Zealand-funded study delving into unsolved outbreaks of human gastroenteritis (vomiting and diarrhoea). The full results have just been published in the top international Journal of Clinical Microbiology (http://jcm.asm.org/content/53/1/15.full.pdf+html).

The publication describes use of a customized one-step RT-PCR assay that detected HPeV3 in a fecal sample from a 2-year-old child as part of a gastroenteritis outbreak investigation at a child care facility in which 8 individuals were affected over a 17-day period. The HPeV type 3 designated as HPeV3 NZ/ 2012-176 was confirmed on phylogenetic analysis.

The parechoviruses are a distinct genus of human and animal enteric viruses, classified in the family _Picornaviridae_. Their protein components share no more than 30 percent sequence identity with other members of the family. Human parechoviruses were first identified in 1956 and previously known as echoviruses 22 and 23. To date, 16 genotypes of HPeV (HPeV 1-16) have been identified although HPeV-1, 2 and 3 contribute account for majority of the infections worldwide. The available data on HPeV genotypes has highlighted HPeV types 1 to 6 as the most common genotypes. The remaining genotypes 7-16 have been very rarely found despite sustained HPeV surveillance programs in many developed countries like the United States, Japan, and the Netherlands (http://jcm.asm.org/content/46/12/3965.full).

HPeV type 1 is known to be associated with asymptomatic infection, whereas type 3 seems to be more virulent and has been reported to be associated with sepsis-like syndrome, meningitis, encephalitis, and hepatitis in neonates and young infants. Human parechovirus infection is considered to show a seasonal pattern in temperate climates. Generally, parechovirus spreads from person to person through contact with respiratory droplets, saliva or faeces from an infected person.

There is no specific treatment for parechovirus infection in general; treatment is supportive only. Good hygiene is vital to protect against parechovirus infection. Washing hands with soap and water after going to the toilet, before eating, after wiping noses and after changing nappies should help decrease the risk of suffering from the disease. Furthermore, various studies report that mere detection of HPeV in clinical samples does not confirm its role as the sole causative agent in gastroenteritis and there are frequently co-infections with other viruses such as rotavirus, norovirus, Aichi virus, salivirus, and astroviruses (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4283143/).

Understandably, such causal associations may be difficult to ascertain without the prior knowledge about history of previous illnesses as HPeV-like enteroviruses may continue to be shed for long periods among asymptomatic individuals.

Given the more serious illness associated with this HPeV3, the New Zealand researchers recommended that clinicians and health authorities consider routine testing for this pathogen in instances of severe disease such as encephalitis, neonatal sepsis, and paralysis, as already occurs in the United States, Japan, and Europe. - Mod.UBA
