Preliminary tests found "minuscule" amounts of anthrax spores at 2 more
Florida post offices that handled mail for the tabloid publishing company
whose employee died of anthrax, health and postal officials said on Friday.
The spores were found in nonpublic mail processing areas at a post office
in Lake Worth and the Blue Lake distribution and delivery center in Boca
Raton -- one sample in a vacuum cleaner and the other on a sorting machine.
The areas where the spores were found were scrubbed down with bleach after
the offices closed on Thursday. They reopened on Friday.
Investigators believe anthrax was introduced to the AMI building through
the mail. They have not found the letter or package but are trying to trace
its path through the postal service's hub-and-spoke routing system by
testing for anthrax spores.

CNN has learned that a New York Post employee has tested positive for
cutaneous anthrax, bringing the total number of U.S. anthrax infections to 7.
Meanwhile, investigators are combing the route of a New Jersey postal
worker who tested positive for cutaneous anthrax. Her duties involved
picking up stamped mail from some 250 domestic and business addresses, and
her route may yield clues to the origin of anthrax-tainted letters. Letters
containing anthrax mailed to NBC and a U.S. senator were postmarked
Trenton, but investigators do not know if the letter carrier had contact
with the infected letters.
Investigators also were examining security videotape from various New
Jersey mail facilities. Investigators said she did not pick up mail or
packages from drop boxes.
A senior law enforcement official said of the anthrax found in 3 areas --
New York, Washington and Florida -- "You've got to believe they're all from
the same source." He said that in all 3 cases the anthrax particles were
"finely ground," making them easier to disperse in the air and be inhaled.
Tests continue, but the similarities could help authorities narrow their
focus and identify the culprit or culprits responsible for the tainted
letters.
Latest developments
- Federal law enforcement investigators were conducting fingerprint and DNA
analysis on envelopes sent to NBC News in New York and to Senate Majority
Leader Tom Daschle. Handwriting analysis was proving more difficult,
sources said, because the writer used block letters, the most difficult
type of writing to analyze.
- Investigators were checking the still-quarantined American Media Inc. in
Boca Raton, Florida, to determine whether any mail there may be similar to
the New York and Washington letters.
- "We have ruled out neither international terrorism nor domestic
terrorism," said Attorney General John Ashcroft, adding that the acts might
be a combination of both. "It may well be that we have opportunists in the
United States or terrorists in the United States who are acting in ways
that are unrelated."
- Late Thursday, health officials in Palm Beach County, Florida, said
anthrax spores had been found in 2 postal facilities, one in Boca Raton and
one in Lake Worth. The facilities will not be shut down, they said, but
crews would decontaminate them overnight.
- Hundreds of anthrax hoaxes are straining what FBI Director Robert Mueller
described Thursday as "an already overburdened enforcement system." Mueller
said his agency has investigated 3300 chemical or biological threats in the
last 18 days. Of those cases, 2500 involved anthrax threats.
- Thousands of New Yorkers, shaken by last month's terrorist attacks and
further rattled by a series of anthrax incidents, are flooding emergency
rooms and phoning health authorities, taxing the city's health system,
officials said Thursday.

President Bush's homeland security chief said on Friday the same anthrax
strains were used in attacks in New York, Washington and Florida, as the
administration stepped up efforts to find those responsible for
distributing the potentially deadly bacteria.
"The tests to date have concluded that the strains are indistinguishable,"
Homeland security director Tom Ridge told a White House news conference,
adding that tests have also shown that the "strains have not been
weaponized."

Second New Jersey postal worker tests positive for anthrax
--------------------------------------------
A second New Jersey postal worker has tested positive for cutaneous (skin)
anthrax as investigators work to track down the source of the bacteria.
The latest confirmed cases are a female New York Post editorial assistant
who tested positive for cutaneous anthrax and a man who works at a mail
distribution center in New Jersey who tested positive for the same
condition. The man sorts mail at the Hamilton Township distribution center,
which handled the anthrax-tainted letters sent to NBC anchorman Tom Brokaw
and Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle. In a statement released Friday, the
New York Post said its infected employee, who was not named, has already
returned to work and "is expected to make a swift and complete recovery."
It was not clear how she was exposed to the bacteria.
Both the West Trenton, New Jersey, post office where the infected letter
carrier worked, and the area's main mail processing and distribution center
were closed Friday as investigators scoured the buildings for clues to the
origin of the anthrax.
Latest developments
- Wearing white protective suits, teams of workers from the Environmental
Protection Agency, Department of Defense and U.S. Capitol Police ran
environmental tests Friday on several buildings on and around Capitol Hill.
But authorities stressed that it was unlikely they would find any evidence
of anthrax outside of the areas known to be contaminated -- the office of
Sen. Tom Daschle, D-South Dakota, in the Hart Senate office building, and a
Senate mailroom in the Dirksen Senate office building next door.
- Friday, federal health authorities said 3 of the 31 Capitol Hill workers
that had tested positive for anthrax exposure were in fact negative.
