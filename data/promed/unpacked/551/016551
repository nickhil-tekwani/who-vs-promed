In the past 24 hours there have been 14 additional cases of MERS-CoV infection confirmed, bringing the total number of cases to 64 including 5 deaths.

All cases were nosocomially transmitted.

Exposure occurred in hospital D during the period 27-29 May 2015 (?10 patients).
Exposure occurred in the emergency room where case #14 had been treated.

3 patients were admitted to the same ward in hospital B where the index case had been admitted.

1 patient was in hospital F in the same ward as case #16.

[The outbreak in South Korea continues with the addition of 14 newly confirmed 3rd generation cases bringing the total number of laboratory confirmed cases in South Korea to 64, including 5 deaths. A key question at this time is whether the outbreak will go on to include 4th generation cases or if transmission will now be interrupted as the index of suspicion for infection has been raised and infection control measures are being implemented early.

The machine translations of media reports and MOH reports is unfortunately sub-optimal, so there has been editorial license in interpreting and presenting the information above. Should there be errors, I apologize in advance, and will correct them accordingly.

According to a media report submitted by ProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka, 10 of the 14 newly confirmed cases were reported from Samsung Hospital in Seoul (http://www.newsis.com/ar_detail/view.html?ar_id=NISX20150607_0013712018) and were all related to case no. 14. This includes the newly reported fatality - a 75-year-old who was treated in the Emergency department at Samsung Hospital in Seoul (case no.64). In total there have now been 17 cases associated with Samsung hospital and case no.14, suggesting that case no. 14 was also a superspreader. There are 2 healthcare workers among the 17 cases associated with Samsung hospital.

[2] South Korea, viral sequencing - media report

Whole viral genome analysis has been completed, showing an almost perfect match with pre-existing MERS-CoV sequenced from the Middle East.

Sequencing was done by the National Health Research Institute on specimens from sputum of case #2 grown on Vero cells, with the assistance of the Viral Society of Korea, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Holland Biomedical Research Center (EMC -- Erasmus Medical Center), including domestic and foreign research institutions and professional virus by sharing association with gene sequence information, analysis of the characteristics of the virus.

The virus appears to have come from Saudi Arabia with a gene sequence that matches the virus currently circulating in the Middle East.

The virus ** EMC standard week (GenBank No. JX869059) showed 99.55 percent was consistent [with virus circulating in Saudi Arabia]. In addition, whilst the virus sequenced 55 genes, it was 99.82 percent homologous with Saudi Arabia isolate (GenBank No. KF600628, KSA_Hafr-Al- Batin_ 2013).

The virus was 1st discovered in 2012, from a patient in Saudi Arabia and was isolated by the EMC, and is available at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH -- National Institutes of Health) bank of genetic information (GenBank) 'JX869059', and is used as the standard for comparing variances.

[A visual representation of the phylogeny of the MERS-CoV including the Korea/China sample can be found at http://www.virology-bonn.de/. It will be interesting to see where the Korean virus will be, presumably close to KSA_Hafr-Al- Batin_ 2013, similar to that of the Korea/China virus.

In a media report submitted by ProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka, Lee Ju-shil, the head of the Korean National Institute of Health, said there was little difference identified in gene sequencing between the MERS virus in South Korea and that in the Middle East. The sample was sent to the other institutes mentioned in the above MOH report to jointly analyze the virus. Given the match greater than 99 percent, the conclusion is that the virus is unchanged significantly from that circulating in the Middle East (http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/925668.shtml). - Mod.MPP]

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Republic of Korea
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
On [5 Jun 2015], the National IHR Focal Point of the Republic of Korea notified WHO of 5 additional confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), including 1 death.

Details of the cases are as follows:

1- A 49-year-old male developed symptoms on 23 May [2015] while admitted to hospital since 14 May [2015]. The patient shared the room with a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case that was reported in a previous DON on [4 Jun 2015] (case n. 1). He tested positive for MERS-CoV on 31 May [2015].

2- A 62-year-old male developed symptoms on [2 Jun 2015] and visited the emergency room of a local health care facility on the same day. The patient was admitted to hospital between 20 and 28 May [2015]. During this period, he shared the same floor with 4 patients that were later confirmed and reported as MERS-CoV cases. On 29 May [2015], the patient visited a local health care facility for unrelated medical conditions. He was isolated in a negative pressure room on [2 Jun 2015]. The patient tested positive for MERS-CoV on [3 Jun 2015].

3- A 24-year-old male developed symptoms on 22 May [2015]. Between 22 and 28 May [2015], the patient was admitted to the same hospital room as 2 previously confirmed MERS-CoV cases. He tested positive for MERS-CoV on [4 Jun 2015].

4- A 70-year-old female developed symptoms on 31 May [2015]. The doctor who was involved in the care of her husband was confirmed positive for MERS-CoV on [3 Jun 2015]. She tested positive for MERS-CoV on [4 Jun 2015].

5- A 45-year-old male developed symptoms on [4 Jun 2015]. The patient was admitted to hospital from 14 to 27 May [2015] for an unrelated medical condition. Although he did not have symptoms for MERS-CoV, the patient was isolated at home because of close contact at the hospital with MERS-CoV cases. He was transferred to another hospital for isolation on [2 Jun 2015]. The patient tested positive for MERS-CoV on [3 Jun 2015].

Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for the cases.

The National IHR Focal Point of the Republic of Korea also notified WHO of the death of 1 previously reported MERS-CoV case. The case was reported in a previous DON on 30 May [2015] (case n. 3).

So far, a total of 41 MERS-CoV cases, including 4 deaths, have been reported to WHO by the National IHR Focal Point of the Republic of Korea. One of the 41 cases is the case that was confirmed in China and also notified by the National IHR Focal Point of China.

Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1190 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 444 related deaths.

[As this update covers the period through 5 Jun 2015, the tally of cases reported by South Korea is 41 cases, not including the 9 cases reported on 6 Jun 2015 and the 14 cases reported for 7 Jun 2015 in Korea, bringing the tally up to 64 cases in South Korea. Of note, all 5 of the cases reported above are 3rd generation nosocomially acquired cases, with exposure to other laboratory confirmed cases in the healthcare environment.

[4] Saudi Arabia 2 new cases - MOH 6 Jun 2015
Date: Sat 6 Jun 2015

http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/Statistics-2015-06-06-001.aspx


As of 12 noon today, 6 Jun 2015, there have been a total of:
1026 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
450 deaths,
563 recoveries and
13 currently active cases including 2 cases on home isolation.

In the past 24 hours there have been
2 newly confirmed cases,
0 fatalities and
0 recoveries reported

[reported CFR (case fatality rate) 43.9 percent - Mod.MPP]

Information on newly reported cases:
1- Hufoof: 65-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker, currently in critical condition. History of possible contact with other case(s) currently under review.

2- Hufoof: 56-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker, currently in stable condition. History of possible contact with other case(s) currently under review.

[With the addition of these 2 newly confirmed cases, both from Hufoof, there have now been 28 cases reported from Hufoof since 20 Apr 2015. While information is not provided on possible high risk exposures, it appears as though the MERS-CoV is circulating in Hufoof, and from earlier cases it appears as though there has been both household contact as well as nosocomial transmission as part of this outbreak.
