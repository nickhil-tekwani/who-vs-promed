A woman suspected of suffering from Crimean-Congo virus was admitted to the Holy Family Hospital (HFH) on Tuesday [30 Jun 2015].

The Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) patient was brought from Kallar Kahar in Chakwal with symptoms making the doctors suspect she is suffering from the virus.

"The patient's condition is improving fast," said Dr Javed Hayyat, the doctor in charge of the infectious diseases ward at HFH.

The doctor said that samples have been sent to the National Institute of Health (NIH) for confirmation of CCHF, and a report will arrive in a day or 2. He said that the HFH has taken precautionary measures, in accordance with the protocol issued by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to prevent the disease from spreading.

The 1st case of CCHF was reported in Rawalpindi in 1976, and a Dr Mateen also died while treating a Congo virus patient at the Central General Hospital, now called the Benazir Bhutto Hospital. In 2002, a 25-year-old intern physician, Dr Farzana, at the Holy Family Hospital [FHF] also died while treating a patient.

In September 2010, 8 staff members at the HFH including 4 women contracted the disease but fortunately survived.

[The circumstances under which the patient acquired her CCHF virus infection are not stated. It could have been via tick bite or via exposure to the blood of an infected animal. From the above report, it seems unlikely that she was infected from close contact with an infected individual, as most of these cases of transmission occur in health care facilities, as mentioned above. Implementation of the WHO protocol in treatment of these patients is prudent to avoid nosocomial infections.

The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities can also occur, which is why there is concern for the health care workers who are in contact with patients.

The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.

CCHF virus is a tickborne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_.
