This is a synopsis, by the writer, of an article which appeared in the
magazine New Scientist last week, and may be read in full at the URL
address above.
Most of the world's industrialized countries do not vaccinate their
livestock for foot and mouth disease. This is because, once you have
eradicated the disease from an area, this is the most sensitive means of
detecting whether the virus has crept back in again - any accidental
infection leads to a full-blown outbreak. The gamble is that you can
contain the outbreak fast enough to prevent real damage, then stamp out the
infection again and regain your FMD-free status. Non-vaccination policies
are based on the calculation that such outbreaks will happen rarely enough,
and be detected soon enough, that this calculated vulnerability will be
cheaper than vaccinating.
Besides, in a few vaccinated animals, FMD virus can cause subclinical
infection. It is not clear whether this can infect other animals, or how
long it persists. But the theoretical risk that this might have happened
means meat from a vaccinated animal might be carrying the virus; standard
tests cannot distinguish whether an animal has made antibodies to infection
or to the vaccine. Other regions trying to remain FMD-free without
vaccination will not buy meat from countries that vaccinate in case it is
harboring such subclinical virus.
That at least is the official line. In fact, tests can distinguish infected
animals from animals vaccinated even with the current FMD vaccine, made of
killed whole virus. The key is to test for non-structural proteins made
only by live FMD virus; they only occur in infected animals. Accuracy is
currently some 90 per cent, not good enough to guarantee every animal is
uninfected. But it is good enough to guarantee statistically that a herd is
uninfected. This rate goes up with "marker" vaccines deliberately designed
to be distinguishable from infection, such as vaccines now commercially
available for classical swine fever.
Meanwhile, the cost-benefit calculation for non-vaccination may be
changing. The risk of accidental infection increases with global trade and
travel. The risk of deliberate infection is considered non-negligible by
many intelligence agencies. Detecting an outbreak before it has spread far
is made more difficult by modern livestock stocking densities and marketing
practices and a decline in veterinary surveillance. The current outbreak in
Europe suggests not vaccinating may not be cheaper after all.
So why don't countries eradicate diseases of concern such as FMD, then
vaccinate and conduct active surveillance for infection? It would be more
expensive in the short run than not vaccinating and simply watching for
outbreaks, but surely cheaper than Europe's current FMD disaster, both in
terms of money and public opinion. And surveillance technology could become
cheaper and more reliable with a little investment. Perhaps it is harder to
rely on an exporter having actively tested than to rely on one whose
freedom from infection is guaranteed by the livestock's vulnerability.
Perhaps the new technological options for vaccinating, or increased risks
of not vaccinating, have not yet been fully considered.
But there is another benefit to add to the non-vaccination calculation. If
you don't vaccinate for FMD and other livestock diseases, you can refuse
imports from countries that have the disease, or that vaccinate. These may
well be poorer countries with lower production costs. The EU says it does
not vaccinate because it must protect its exports to FMD-free countries,
but these amounted to only 5 per cent of total EU meat sales in 1999 (which
reached $17 billion), and that was before some import bans due to BSE. But
78 per cent of meat sales that year were domestic. Some would surely be
lost to foreign competitors who vaccinate for FMD, if the FMD-free,
non-vaccination policy did not constitute an import barrier.
Nonetheless, Belgium and the Netherlands have formally asked other EU
countries to consider vaccinating routinely for FMD again. They have not
said how this would be coupled with monitoring for subclinical infection.
(Such routine prophylaxis must be clearly distinguished from the emergency
vaccination permitted and now planned in the EU to contain outbreaks. All
such emergency vaccinated animals must be destroyed before the region
regains its disease-free status under current rules.)
