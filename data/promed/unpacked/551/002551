In response to the posting by Georgios Gouvras (Jan. 15, 1998), I offer the
following thoughts:
1. While the EC may not formally be a member of WHO, the individual Member
States of the EC are bound by the International Health Regulations (IHR) as
Member States of the WHO, and thus would be in violation of the IHR when
they comply with the EC Directive banning the importation of fresh fishery
products from East Africa because of fears of cholera transmission. It does
not answer to say that the EC is not formally a Member State of the WHO,
nor does the action by the EC excuse individual Member States of the EC
from their international legal obligations under the IHR.
2. The SPS Agreement mandates risk assessment (SPS Agreement, art. 5.1).
Risk assessment is, however, to be based on scientific principles and
evidence (SPS Agreement, art. 5.2). In addition, "Members shall base their
sanitary or phytosanitary measures on international standards, guidelines
or recommendations, where they exist" (SPS Agreement, art. 3.1). Sanitary
or phytosanitary measures that exceed international standards, guidelines,
or recommendations can only be maintained if there is a scientific
justification (SPS Agreement, art. 3.3) based on a scientific risk
assessment (SPS Agreement, art. 5.1) and sufficient scientific evidence
(SPS Agreement, art. 2.2).
It is clear, and has been for many decades, that WHO does not recommend
import bans to prevent the spread of cholera. Thus, the relevant
international recommendations in the cholera transmission scenarios come
from the WHO (see SPS Agreement, Annex A, 3.d). My reading of years and
years of WHO efforts to try to get countries not to impose import bans and
other harsh trade restrictions when cholera breaks out in another country
is that the international scientific community has assessed the risk of
cholera transmission through international trade and has found the risk to
be theoretical at best. In other words, in the cholera transmission
context, there does appear to be an approved and formalized system of
scientific risk assessment and generally accepted levels of tolerable and
unacceptable risk. Under the SPS Agreement, the EC has the burden of
demonstrating that its import ban -- a measure more protective than
international standards, guidelines, and recommendations -- is supported by
a scientific risk assessment and sufficient scientific evidence (SPS
Agreement, art. 3.3). Although I am not a scientist, the opposition of the
WHO to import bans like the EC's strongly suggests that the EC's scientific
risk assessment and scientific evidence are questionable.
In addition, even if the EC has a valid risk assessment and sufficient
scientific evidence, it still confronts the trade-related discipline that
"Members shall ensure that such measures are not more trade-restrictive
than required to achieve their appropriate level of sanitary or
phytosanitary protection" (SPS Agreement, art. 5.6). This echoes the
"necessary" test in Article XX(b) of GATT that excuses violations of GATT
principles in order to protect human, plant, or animal life or health. GATT
law has long held that this "necessary" test in Article XX(b) means that
the measure protecting public health has to be the least trade restrictive
measure possible (see Thai Cigarette Case, Tuna-Dolphin Case, U.S. Gasoline
Case). In cholera transmission situations, WHO has stated, most recently as
of January 9, 1998 (probably directly in response to the EC ban), that the
best way to deal with a theoretical risk of cholera transmission is not
through embargo but through bilateral cooperation and arrangements between
the exporting and importing countries. Following the lead of the most
relevant international organization as directed by the SPS Agreement, I
conclude that the EC import ban is not required to protect public health in
the EC within the meaning of the SPS Agreement nor is it necessary within
the meaning of Article XX(b) of GATT.
In sum, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and Mozambique have reason to complain to
(1) the WHO Director-General under Article 93 of the IHR that individual
Member States of the EC are in violation of their international legal
duties under the IHR by imposing an excessive measure in response to
cholera outbreaks under the EC Directive, and (2) the WTO under the Dispute
Settlement Understanding that the EC is in violation of the SPS Agreement
for imposing a sanitary measure that is not based on sufficient scientific
evidence and that is not the least-trade restrictive measure available to
the EC to protect public health.
