The Ontario Racing Commission (ORC) announced on 12 June 2013 that there have been 5 confirmed reports of the neurologic equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) in thoroughbreds residing in barn 1 at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

In a notice to the industry, the ORC reported that one horse was euthanized on 10 Jun 2013 after becoming recumbent with a fever. A 2nd horse in the same barn also had a fever and showed neurologic signs; that horse was transported to the Ontario Veterinary College for evaluation and treatment, the notice said.

The notice indicates that thoroughbred racing will continue at Woodbine; however, according to the notice, the ORC implemented the following restrictions and infectious disease protocols:

"In order to determine any further spread of the disease to horses in other barns, no horses are to exit Woodbine Racetrack without ORC approval for the next 7 days (until 19 Jun 2013). This restriction may be reviewed based on the progression of the disease.

"In addition, no horse is allowed in or out of barn 1 or barn 3 for the next 7 days, including training. This restriction may be reviewed, based on the progression of the disease.

"All horses stabled at Woodbine must have their temperatures taken and recorded visibly on the horse's stall door for inspection. Trainers with horses that have clinical signs consistent with EHV-1 infection (including fever (101.5 F/38.5 C or above), respiratory signs (cough, nasal discharge, and/or neurologic signs) must report these findings to their veterinarian immediately."

In the notice, the ORC recommends that horsemen who had horses at Woodbine within the last 7 days monitor their horses for signs of illness. "The neurotrophic form of EHV-1 identified from these horses differs from the non-neurotrophic form identified from the standardbreds at Campbellville in May of this year [2013]," the notice relayed.

The ORC indicated they received input from the office of the chief veterinarian for Ontario; Ontario Ministry of Agriculture and Food; and Woodbine management, veterinarians, and horse people to ensure best practices are in place to contain the disease.

[The track is making every effort to protect its horses, and itself, even extending the warning to owners whose horses have left the track. This disease may be seasonal: seasonal as in the race season, the show season, and a general increase in the horse's stress. Stress weakens the immune system and may set the animal up for this particular virus.
