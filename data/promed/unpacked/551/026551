The room next door to where a British couple died in an Egyptian hotel last month on [20 Aug 2018] had been fumigated with "farm-strength" insecticide just hours earlier, it has been confirmed.

An investigation was launched after the couple died at the luxury 5-star resort, although a further post-mortem into their deaths will be carried out when their bodies are repatriated. Egyptian officials said on [Mon 10 Sep 2018] they would release the bodies so they can be returned to the UK, and the British can conduct their own post-mortem. Egypt's general prosecutor released a statement ordering the release of the bodies to a UK Embassy representative in Cairo. The statement says the results of the autopsy will be released at a later stage and that the investigation will continue.

According to the Times, the day before the couple died, 20 Aug 2018, Namaa Agricultural and Engineering Services sprayed an adjacent [room] with lambda-cyhalothrin 5 percent. The door of the room, which was sealed with tape, was at the end of the corridor next to where the [British couple] was due to stay. It is feared the fumes may have entered their room through the ceiling space.

The insecticide is used to control flies and is similar to that used to fumigate aeroplanes when they land. It was developed in 1977 and has been approved for use on agricultural land in the UK since 1988. But according to Public Health England, prolonged exposure can be harmful to humans. They warn symptoms can include dizziness, loss of appetite, and production of too much saliva [excessive salivation or drooling - Mod.TG]. It is highly toxic to mammals and is a known irritant.

A World Health Organisation bulletin from 1990 investigated possible poisoning cases involving the insecticide. According to the report: "Acute pyrethroid poisoning in humans is characterised by headache, nausea, and, when severe, muscle fasciculation (spontaneous contractions) and convulsive attacks."

The couple's daughter [KO] has previously mentioned a "funny smell" in the room at Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel the night before they died. The results of the post-mortem were still pending on [Fri 7 Sep 2018], nearly 3 weeks after the tragic double death.

[KO] told ITV News that she had returned to her parents' room on [Wed 22 Aug 2018], the day after their deaths, to collect belongings and noticed the cleaners had been in [the room]. "All the floors had been mopped, all the bedding had been changed, and for those 24 hours, maintenance was in and out quite often. If it happened over here, it [the room] would have been taped off, but the room wasn't taped off until, I believe, on [Thu 23 Aug 2018], so everybody and anybody could go in that room on that Wednesday."

She believes potentially crucial evidence may have been lost in the process. "There was obviously evidence left over from my mum and dad in that room that I think was quite crucial as to why they possibly died. There was a distinct change of smell in the room. The air conditioning unit was a lot crisper and cooler, and you could tell that somebody had been in that room doing something."

Speaking with the BBC, [KO] explained, "At 11 o' clock, I went to knock on the door to see if they were just having a bit of a lie-in and didn't want to be bothered, and as I opened the door, I could see that my dad was extremely ill. He was staggering back to the bed. Mum was laid on the bed. And I could tell there was something seriously wrong with them." Her father died in the couple's room at the hotel, while her mother was later rushed to the hospital, where she later passed away.

[KO] said she was feeling "disheartened" that neither post-mortem results had been returned but didn't think "the answers will be the answer I necessary believe."

Egyptian authorities ordered an investigation into the deaths despite saying the British couple died of natural causes.

Thomas Cook evacuated 300 guests staying at the all-inclusive Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel in the Red Sea resort town of Hurghada. Around 200 people have lodged sickness complaints against the resort.

Thomas Cook commissioned an independent hygiene specialist and air-quality specialist to conduct a series of tests at the hotel. It said the results of the tests, which were reviewed by Dr Vanya Gant from University College London Hospital's NHS Foundation Trust, identified "a high level of _E. coli_ and _Staphylococcus_ bacteria." [This leads us to believe there may have been sanitation issues at the hotel. However, any sample from a toilet could possibly have detected these bacteria. - Mod.TG]

The travel firm said its experts did not think _E. coli_ killed the victims. [Apparently the autopsies have not been conducted. What is the travel firm trying to say? - Mod.TG]

_E. coli_ caused the deaths of a British couple who died after falling ill at a holiday resort in Egypt, the country's authorities have said. [JC], 69, and his wife, [SC], 63, from Burnley, died in the Red Sea city of Hurghada on [Tue 21 August 2018].

In an official statement, the Egyptian general prosecutor said post-mortem examinations showed that _E. coli_ bacteria was a factor in both deaths. But the couple's daughter, [KO], described the findings as "absolute rubbish." [KO], who was at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic hotel with her parents, told the BBC she did not believe the symptoms her parents showed were consistent with _E. coli_ infection. She added that further post-mortem examinations of her parents' bodies would be carried out in the UK, on direction from the Home Office.

According to the Egyptian general prosecutor's statement, tests showed [JC] suffered acute intestinal dysentery caused by _E. coli_, and [SC] suffered a complication linked to infection, likely to have been caused by _E. coli_. He also said drinking water samples taken from the hotel were clear of any harmful bacteria, and the bodies showed "no criminal violence."

_E. coli_ is a type of bacteria present in the gut of humans and animals. Most strains are harmless, but some can cause cramps and diarrhoea, and others can cause severe illness if damaging toxins are produced. Any strain of _E. coli_ capable of causing the couple's deaths so quickly would have been very toxic. Prof Brendan Wren, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says they were "very unlucky, because these strains are very rare." But _E. coli_ has killed before, often after people have consumed contaminated food such as meat, bean sprouts, or salad leaves. In these rare cases, the effects can be particularly nasty, and the toxins can have an immediate effect. The internal organs, like the liver and kidneys, are affected and simply start to shut down.

Travel firm Thomas Cook said it noted the statement from the prosecutor and said it would continue to support the couple's daughter and the rest of their family. "We have not yet seen the full report, and we will need time for our own experts to review it," a spokesman said.

Dr Rania Al-Mashat, Egypt's minister of tourism, said the health and safety of tourists to Egypt was "paramount." "We will review the attorney general's autopsy reports in fine detail to determine our next course of action to look after the welfare of our visitors," she said.

Earlier, a report in the Times claimed that the room in the hotel next door to the one the couple shared had been fumigated. But the head of the firm that carried out the work, Namaa Services, denied any wrongdoing and said it used authorised concentrations of chemicals. The Egyptian prosecutor's report, issued on [Wed 12 Sep 2018], also said the smell in the couple's room, which had been mentioned by the couple's daughter, was that of an insecticide used in an adjacent room. It said the chemical was non-toxic, and there were no traces of it discovered in samples taken from the bodies of the deceased.

Last week [Wed 5 Sep 2018], hygiene tests at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic found high levels of _E. coli_. Thomas Cook said at the time the independent experts it had commissioned to carry out the tests did not believe the results "shed any light" on the cause of death.

[JC] died in his room, while [SC], a Thomas Cook employee, died after being taken to the hospital.

[At this point it appears there are competing theories regarding the cause of death. So a definitive analysis seems to be in order.

The 1st article points out the following: "But according to Public Health England, prolonged exposure can be harmful to humans. They warn symptoms can include dizziness, loss of appetite, and production of too much saliva. It is highly toxic to mammals and is a known irritant." Furthermore, the 1st article notes [in the unedited version], "Speaking with the BBC, KO explained: 'At 11 o' clock, I went to knock on the door to see if they were just having a bit of a lie-in [sleeping late] and didn't want to be bothered, and as I opened the door, I could see that my dad was extremely ill. He was staggering back to the bed. Mum was laid on the bed. And I could tell there was something seriously wrong with them.'"

It is worthwhile to note the clinical signs in the 1st article do not indicate vomiting, as might be seen with _E. coli_.

The 1st article [in the unedited version] reports: "Around 200 people have lodged sickness complaints against the resort." Whether this is related to a possible chemical smell or is a psychosomatic response or caused by other issues with _E. coli_, we are not told.

The 1st and 2nd articles differ in regard to the presence of _E. coli_. So clearly there are differences in the reporting, and, hopefully, evidence in the bodies will be properly obtained with regard to temperature and anti-tampering devices. Perhaps a 3rd party will be able to find the correct cause of death and bring closure to the family.

According to the National Pesticide Information Center, "Lambda-cyhalothrin belongs to a group of chemicals called pyrethroids. Pyrethroids are manmade chemicals that are similar to the natural insecticides pyrethrins. Scientists developed pyrethroid insecticides to have properties better than those of the pyrethrins."

"Lambda-cyhalothrin is similar to the pyrethroid cyhalothrin. Due to their similarity, researchers sometimes use toxicity tests conducted with cyhalothrin to evaluate the toxicity of lambda-cyhalothrin. Lambda-cyhalothrin is a colorless-to-beige solid that has a mild odor.

"Pyrethroids, including lambda-cyhalothrin, disrupt the normal functioning of the nervous system in an organism. By disrupting the nervous system of insects [or mammals], lambda-cyhalothrin may cause paralysis or death.

"Individuals working with lambda-cyhalothrin in laboratories reported symptoms of facial tingling and burning sensations. Symptoms began within 30 minutes of exposure and lasted for 6 hours to 2 days. All incidents involved people handling relatively pure or concentrated lambda-cyhalothrin.

"Out of 38 field workers, 4 reported adverse health effects from exposure to lambda-cyhalothrin. Three of the workers reported skin irritation or burning sensations that developed 45-60 minutes after exposure and lasted for 5, 18, and 72 hours. The other worker experienced a skin rash that developed 24 hours after exposure and lasted several days. All workers handled concentrated lambda-cyhalothrin, and 3 of the 4 applied diluted solutions.

"Lambda-cyhalothrin may cause irritation to the skin, throat, nose, and other body parts if exposed. Skin tingling, burning, and prickling feelings, particularly around the face, are unique temporary symptoms of exposure. Other symptoms may include dizziness, headache, nausea, lack of appetite, and fatigue. In severe poisonings, seizures and coma may occur" (see http://npic.orst.edu/factsheets/l_cyhalogen.pdf).

There is little to no data on the breakdown, metabolism, or excretion of lambda-cyhalothrin in humans. It stands to reason with intense spraying and connecting rooms, the fumes may well have been in an adjoining room.

This is a tragic situation. Hopefully answers will be forthcoming for the victims' family and to prevent other similar occurrences. - Mod.TG
