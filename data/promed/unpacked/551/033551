Hungary's health authorities have found what they believe to be a
highly pathogenic H5 avian flu virus in poultry, but are unclear
whether it is the deadly H5N1 strain, the farm ministry said on
Friday [9 Jun 2005].
"It has been found to be a highly pathogenic type," Deputy Chief Vet
Lajos Bognar told a news conference.
"Since the N1 type has been spreading in the region, it is highly
likely to be that, but it could equally be N7 or any other strain,"
he said, adding that further tests would be conducted in the UK.
The ministry ordered the slaughter of 300 000 birds, mainly ducks and
geese, in Bacs-Kiskun country in southeast Hungary, where the
outbreak of the virus was found at a farm with more than 3000 geese
[see comment].
The H5N1 virus killed over 60 wild birds in Hungary in February and
March, but there have not been any cases in domestic poultry and the
government lifted all safety zones in late April as there had been no
cases for a month.
Neighbouring Romania has reported a series of bird flu outbreaks on
farms across the country, leading to the culling of hundreds of
thousands of fowl.
Neither country has had a case in humans.

[H5 virus was initially confirmed in Hungary in mute swans on 15 Feb
2006, apparently in the vicinity of the current outbreak. As a
writing on the wall, posting 20060217.0519 included the following
statement: "Bacs-Kiskun is an important poultry-producing region in
Hungary's agricultural heartland, and there is a farm housing 3000
ducks near the villages."
Hungary is a major goose-liver producer/exporter. The mute swan
infection was duly reported to the OIE; see Hungary's OIE
notification at <http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_29.HTM#Sec20>.
According to EU's Animal Disease Notification System (ADNS), 12 wild
birds have been reported so far as infected in Hungary, with the last
date of confirmation being 13 Mar 2006. So far, 4 of the ADNS
countries -- Denmark, France, Germany and Sweden -- have reported
HPAI in domestic fowl subsequent to the discovery of infection in wild birds.
A WHO map, showing the region in southern Hungary where wild birds
were affected, is accessible at
