MURINE TYPHUS - JAPAN EX INDONESIA (BALI)

A 23 year old Japanese man who returned from Bali, Indonesia, was
diagnosed and confirmed to have murine typhus on 10 Apr 2008. When he
stayed on Bali from 20 Jan 2008 to 11 Mar 2008, he often went surfing
at Madewi and Kuta beaches. He was admitted to our hospital on 24 Mar
2008 (on the 7th day of illness). Fever, thrombocytopenia, and renal
impairment were seen on admission.

Rickettsiosis was suspected since erythematous rash appeared on his
8th day of illness. _Rickettsia typhi_ DNA was detected from his
blood and skin specimen by PCR at the National Institute for
Infectious Diseases (NIID), Japan.

Furthermore, an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and
immunoperoxidase assay (IP) for antibodies reactive with _R. typhi_
antigens showed raised levels of IgM and IgG. He was given
minocycline and completely recovered.

Surprisingly, another case of murine typhus was reported in Chiba,
Japan, this April 2008. The NIID detected _R. typhi_ DNA from the
patient's blood. Murine typhus is not believed to be endemic in
Japan. Considering the incubation period of murine typhus, they
contracted the disease abroad. Further investigation of the 2nd case
is continuing. These 2 consecutive cases of imported murine typhus in
Japan may be alarming that murine typhus might be endemic at some
surf spots in Bali.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Takeshita and collegues for this 1st-hand report.
Although they state that murine typhus is not endemic in Japan,
Sakaguchi et al (1) reported a case of murine typhus serologically
diagnosed in a man from Tokushima, Japan, and Takagi et al (2)
reported a serologically diagnosed case from Fukui. The 1st report
states that murine typhus had not been reported in Japan after the
1950s and also state the the disese may have emerged because of the
increase in black rats in the country. This posted case is diagnosed
by more modern DNA technology.
