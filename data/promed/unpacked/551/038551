6 exposed to rabid cat in west Lake Worth; owner sought
-------------------------------------------------------
Six people are being treated after exposure to a rabid cat that was caught west of Lake Worth [Palm Beach County, Florida], and authorities are urging the cat's former owners to come forward because they may have been exposed to the disease.

Animal care and control captain David Walesky and Tim O'Connor, of the Palm Beach County Health Department, spoke on Wednesday afternoon [20 May 2015] and said they are looking for a 2nd possibly rabid cat in the neighborhood near Lake Worth Road just east of Florida's Turnpike. There is no description of the missing feline.

Two cats were thrown from a vehicle Friday evening [15 May 2015] near the 3000 block of Woods Walk Boulevard, just north of Lake Worth Road near the Publix shopping plaza, and good Samaritans in the neighborhood attempted to rescue the cats, but one got away. Before the cat was turned over to animal control, it bit and scratched 6 people, O'Connor said. Walesky said they're advising those in the neighborhood not to feed or handle animals they do not know. At this point, they don't know whether they're looking for a live animal or a dead one.

O'Connor said they are not looking into any criminal charges at this time for whoever discarded the cats, but they want to know who they are so they can begin rabies treatment before it's too late. "It's a fatal disease unless treated, and there's a 10-day window to get the medication into their system," O'Connor said. "We're on day 7."

Officials at the health department say that the incubation period for rabies is anywhere from 3 to 8 weeks, so those who don't show any signs of being sick soon after coming in contact with a rabid animal may think they're good to go. But once individuals start showing symptoms, it's too late, officials say. As far as symptoms for rabid animals, it ranges, Walesky said. Raccoons and foxes tend to act friendly at 1st, while other animals just act manic. Once they reach the final stages, the animals become lethargic and then die, he said.

"The best way (to handle a rabid animal) is not to handle it," Walesky said, adding that the best thing to do is to call animal control so they can handle it. Anyone who may have come across the cat or any other sick animals is asked to call Animal Care and Control at 561-233-1200.

[Cats are most likely exposed by rabid bats, as any cat bitten by a rabid fox or raccoon would probably be severely traumatised. Hopefully David Walesky and Tim O'Connor have arranged for the recovered virus from the "1st" cat to be sent to CDC Atlanta for strain typing. Whether the cat tossers are aware of their problem is anyone's guess. As one person cannot drive a car and toss out 2 cats, I think we can assume that 2 people are at risk. We can look forward to either a news release that they came forward and were suitably treated or in 3+ weeks they will present themselves at some hospital emergency department in a fraught state, suitably reported by the public health authorities. - Mod.MHJ
