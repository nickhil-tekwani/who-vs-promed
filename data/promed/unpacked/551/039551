Emergency report
Translation of an e-mail received on 6 Sep 2000 from Dr Luz Alba Cruz de
Urbina, Sub-Director of Prevention and Control, Colombian Institute for
Agriculture and Livestock, Bogota:
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 27 Aug 2000.
Diagnosis confirmation date: 31 Aug 2000.
Estimated date of first infection: between 10 and 18 Aug 2000.
Outbreaks:
Location: Vereda El Almacigo, Necocli municipality, department of Antioquia
(8 degrees 58' N - 76 degrees 75' W )
No. of outbreaks: 1
Comments: the last outbreak in the zone was reported in 1997. The Gulf of
Uraba acts as a natural barrier, separating the outbreak zone from the
disease-free zone without vaccination in Colombia, which has been
recognised by the OIE. Furthermore, the outbreak is not situated in the
protection zone surrounding the disease-free zone.
Total number of animals in the outbreak:
species /susceptible/ cases/ deaths /destroyed /slaughtered
bov(1)/ 502/ 20/ 0 / 0 / 0
sui(2)/ 4 / 0 / 0/ 0 / 0
(1)77 less than 1 year, 144 females aged 1-2 years, 143 females older than
2 years, 134 males aged 1-2 years, 4 males older than 2 years
(2) 3 young animals and 1 adult
Description of affected population: traditional breeding farm with zebus
and crossedbreed animals.
Diagnosis:
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: National Laboratory for Vesicular
Diseases, Colombian Livestock Institute, Bogota, Colombia.
B. Causal agent: virus type O.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: investigations under way.
B. Mode of spread: investigations under way.
C. Other epidemiological details: initial epidemiological surveillance was
conducted in the surrounding area and included approximately 20 000 bovines
on 115 farms; the farms are inspected every 2 days.
Control measures during reporting period:
- quarantine imposed on Necocli municipality in accordance with internal
decision No. 386 of 29 Aug 2000, which provides for restricting movement of
vehicles and persons, carefully disinfecting vehicles and persons,
isolating affected animals or those suspected of being infected,
slaughtering affected animals and possible contact animals, prohibiting the
entry and exit of persons, vehicles or animals into or out of the zone in
question, and carrying out vaccination of susceptible animals;
- immediate vaccination of 20 000 bovines present on the 115 farms located
in the area surrounding the outbreak;
- vaccination of the 45 000 bovines present in the Necocli municipality;
- setting up of 3 control and disinfection posts in strategic locations to
guarantee compliance with the quarantine measures;
- placing of an official on the affected farm to implement and supervise
the measures foreseen in the contingency plan;
- ordering the slaughter and burial of infected animals and in-contact animals;
- ordering the slaughter of pigs present in the surrounding area;
- epidemiological investigation to determine the origin of the infection;
- epidemiological surveillance to track possible spread of infection;
- preparation and distribution of printed material to inform livestock
producers and the general public of the measures taken.
Note from the OIE Central Bureau: this outbreak occurred in the zone in
which Colombia wishes to establish an "FMD free zone with vaccination" (see
World Animal Health in 1999, pages 10 and 69).

[The Gulf of Uraba borders the Darien Gap, the longstanding boundary
between the FMD disease free Central America and the rest of FMD infected
South America. This outbreak will have to be cleaned up before Colombia can
establish this area as a FMD free zone with vaccination - the first step in
extending the FMD free region in the country. Thus, we have another step
back on the FMD clean up campaign in South America. Putting recent results
in Europe, the Middle East and Asia into perspective with the South America
results, leaves me only 2 conclusions. Either we are doing a much better
job of recognizing and reporting FMD worldwide or the Year 2000 is
experiencing a Foot and Mouth Disease pandemic. -Mod.PC
