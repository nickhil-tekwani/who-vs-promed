[ProMED-mail has been reporting sporadic cases of monkeypox (MPX), which are not new to the Central African Republic (CAR). Since 2013, CAR has been experiencing at least one MPX outbreak every year, especially in its eastern region. The case fatality rate continues to be very low.

Prevention of MPX virus infections will not be possible without knowing the source of infection. The question remains about the source of these recent infections within Nigeria, Cameroon, Liberia, and more recently in CAR. Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received.

One wonders whether there is an MPX virus epizootic going on in rodent hosts across a relatively wide geographic area in CAR and the other affected countries. Studies of prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or in previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp., an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected.

The MPX virus clade involved in this outbreak and previous ones is not mentioned. As noted in previous ProMED-mail posts, the monkeypox virus clade in the Congo Basin causes more severe disease in humans -- with a case fatality rate of 11-17 percent -- than the clade in Ghana, which causes few fatalities. - Mod.TY
