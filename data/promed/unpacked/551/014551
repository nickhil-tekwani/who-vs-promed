Case of Yellow Fever in Burkina Faso not confirmed
---------------------------------------------------------
We have heard from a reliable source that the suspected case of yellow
fever in the southern part of the border region of Burkina Faso with Cote
d'Ivoire has not been confirmed by the reference laboratory. The population
of the area has, however, been vaccinated.

[Burkina Faso should be commended for its rapid reaction to the situation.
First, it reported the case to WHO while it was still suspect, as required
by the International Health Regulations. Second, it carried out preventive
vaccination immediately, which would have restricted any further spread.
Given the epidemiological situation, with confirmed cases across the border
in Cote d'Ivoire, that was a wise precaution. The explanation for the
initial positive laboratory result is probably that flavivirus antibodies
are notoriously cross-reactive, & that the patient was infected with a
virus related to yellow fever -- of which there are many in Africa --
giving a false positive result in the test. - Mod.JW
