Wedding guests fall ill in Ankeny; food tested
--------------------
The Iowa Department of Public Health on Sunday began testing samples of food
and drink suspected of sickening dozens of guests at a wedding reception in
Ankeny. 54 people were treated for methemoglobinemia, a rare form of blood
poisoning, at Des Moines hospitals Saturday. All of the 7 adults and 13
children admitted for overnight observation were released Sunday morning,
hospital officials said.
About 500 guests were attending the 1 p.m. wedding at Ankeny Baptist Church.
Several people began fainting soon after the reception started, said the
bride's personal attendant, whose 2-year-old daughter was admitted to Blank
Children's Hospital after she had a glass of punch. The bride and groom
spent the evening in the hospital with ill parents and grandparents.
The health department Sunday began testing food and a frozen punch mix
provided by a caterer, said spokesman Kevin Teale. "Punch seems to have been
a high-impact item, but we're not going to rule anything out," he said. No
investigation will take place until the cause of the illness is determined,
Teale said. Teale would not identify the caterer Sunday. He said the
business was "being very cooperative, and there's nothing to indicate any
wrongdoing" on its part.
Dr. Steven Dawson, emergency-room pediatrician at Blank Children's Hospital,
said the illness, which cuts off the blood's ability to carry oxygen, can be
caused by any of dozens of chemicals that are commonly found in pesticides,
meat preservatives, cleaning solutions, and medications.
Signs and symptoms are a blue tinge to the skin, nausea, vomiting,
dizziness, and fainting, he said. Patients were treated with oxygen and
methylene blue, a dye that restores blood to its normal state, Dawson said.

[Because a number of things are capable of causing methemoglobinemia,
including high levels of nitrate/nitrogen in the water, the water sources in
the area should be included in the investigation.
Other environmental agents capable of producing methemoglobinemia include:
aniline dyes, aromatic amines, arsine, butyl nitrites, chlorates,
chlorobenzene, chromates, combustion products, dimethyltoluidine, foods
containing nitrates or nitrites (including well water), isobutyl nitrite,
naphthalene, nitroaniline, nitrobenzene, nitrofurans, nitrophenol,
nitrosobenzene, resorcinol, silver nitrate, and trinitrotoluene.
A number of pharmaceutical agents may also produce clinical signs, including
local anesthetic agents (e.g. benzocaine, lidocaine, prilocaine), amyl
nitrite, chloroquine, dapsone, nitrates, nitrites, nitroglycerin,
nitroprusside, phenacetin, phenazopyridine, primaquine, quinones, and
sulfonamides.
This could be an extensive investigation. We look forward to an
authoritative account of the findings. - Mod.TG]
