[The USDA Report has now been updated to include data becoming available
during the period from 2 Dec 2000 through 15 Jan 2001. Note that these data
do not include the additional human case reported in the News Release from
the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services on 16 Jan 200, nor
the death of a New York resident on 10 Jan 2001. - Mod.CP
Update on the Current Status of West Nile virus for the period 2 Dec 2000
through 15 Jan 2001
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
There were 2 additional equine clinical cases of West Nile virus (WNV)
infection confirmed during the period, one each from New Jersey and New
York. Both had clinical onset during October. Included is the youngest horse
ever known to develop clinical illness due to WNV in the United States, a
4-month-old colt in Monmouth County, New Jersey. This brings to 59 the total
number of equine cases of clinical WNV infection in 2000, of which 36
survived and 23 (39%) died or were euthanatized.
Information on equine cases of clinical WNV infection in the United States,
2000: [list of 59 horses deleted -- 57 are the same as in West Nile virus
surveillance - USA (54) referenced above - Mod.JW
Note: A total of 11 additional equine cases of WNV infection has been
reported by the States of New Jersey (1) and New York (10) for the year
2000. To date, these cases have not been classified as confirmed or probable
WNV infections by USDA-APHIS for one of the following reasons:
1) Specimens provided to NVSL have tested negative for WNV;
2) inadequate specimens have been provided to NVSL for confirmatory testing;
3) available information on animal history and/or animal identification has
been inadequate to differentiate clinical cases from subclinical infections,
or to conclusively distinguish one animal from another.
One additional human case of WNV infection was reported from New Jersey
during the period. The 76-year-old Morris County woman was hospitalized on
27 August but has improved and is now in a nursing home. The total number of
human cases for the year 2000 is now 20, including one death. [A Second West
Nile Fever death was reported by the New York Department of Health on 10 Jan
2001. An 87-year-old woman who died in December 2000 was the second person
in the United States last year to die after contracting West Nile virus last
year. The woman tested positive on Fri 25 Aug 2000. She had been
hospitalized in a coma since August and died in December [2000. The first
death was an 82-year-old New Jersey man died in September 2000. A sixth New
Jersey resident was confirmed as a West Nile virus case on 16 Jan 2001,
bringing the total for the year to 21 - Mod.CP.
There were no additional mammals reported as WNV-positive during the period.
New York State did re-evaluate the status of several wild mammals previously
reported as positive. As a result, only 5 mammals (other than humans and
horses) are now classified as WNV-positive, rather than the 25 reported
previously from New York.
No additional wild birds were reported as positive for WNV. A total of 4323
birds have been documented as infected with WNV in 12 States plus the
District of Columbia since 1 May 2000.
There were no additional sentinel birds confirmed as WNV-positive. The total
number of sentinel birds, all chickens, found WNV-positive in 2000 remains
at 12.
A total of 3 additional positive mosquito pools were reported. All 3 were
collected in New York several weeks ago. This brings the total for the year
to 481 WNV-positive pools in 5 States.
Since 1 May 2000, a total of 143 counties in 12 States and the District of
Columbia had confirmed findings of WNV in a mosquito, bird, or mammal:
Connecticut (8), Delaware (2), District of Columbia (1), Maryland (8),
Massachusetts (11), New Hampshire (2), New Jersey (20), New York (61), North
Carolina (1), Pennsylvania (17), Rhode Island (4), Vermont (1), and Virginia
(7).
A total of 133 counties detected at least one positive bird, and 109
counties in 8 States and the District of Columbia reported 2 or more
confirmed findings of WNV-positive birds: Connecticut (8), District of
Columbia (1), Maryland (6), Massachusetts (8), New Hampshire (2), New Jersey
(17), New York (56), Pennsylvania (7), and Rhode Island (4).
Sussex County, New Jersey, had WNV-positive horses (3), mosquito pools (6),
and a sentinel chicken, but no WNV-positive wild birds were detected.
Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, had a WNV-positive horse and mosquito pools
(2), but no WNV-positive wild birds were detected. Six other counties in
Pennsylvania (Erie, Pike, Schuylkill, Susquehanna, Union, Wyoming) had at
least one positive mosquito pool but no other WNV activity was reported.
A total of 29 counties in 5 States had at least one wild bird and at least
one mosquito pool reported as positive: Connecticut (Fairfield, New Haven),
Massachusetts (Norfolk, Suffolk), New Jersey (Bergen, Essex, Hunterdon,
Middlesex, Monmouth, Ocean, Passaic, Union), New York (Bronx, Columbia,
Kings, Nassau, New York, Orange, Queens, Richmond, Rockland, Suffolk,
Westchester), and Pennsylvania (Chester, Cumberland, Lehigh, Montgomery,
Philadelphia City, York).
