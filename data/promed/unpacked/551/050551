Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease in Malaysia: Update as of 19 Oct 2000
------------------------------------------------------------------
Since the outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in Singapore in
September, the State of Johor at the southern tip of Malaysian Peninsula,
has stepped up its vigilance for this disease. The first fatal case was
reported in Johor on 3 Oct 2000 and the number of HFMD cases has increased
from 36 in the first week of October to 274 in the past week. Other States
which have reported cases are Selangor, Penang, Kedah, Sabah and Terengganu.
In a press release today (New Straits Times, 19 Oct 2000), the HFMD National
Operations Centre stated that as of 18 Oct 2000, 510 patients have been
admitted to hospital in several states and 393 have sought outpatient
treatment.
HFMD is endemic in Malaysia and in 1997, there was a large outbreak which
resulted in the death of over 40 children due to brainstem
encephalomyelitis. The etiological agent was [identified as Enterovirus 71.
Since then, sporadic cases of HFMD caused by Coxsackie A16 virus and
Enterovirus 71 have been reported in the country. On 12 Oct 2000, the first
fatal case resulting from HFMD complication was reported in the University
Hospital Kuala Lumpur. There was a subtle difference between the course of
illness in this case and that in the cases of 1997. The acute progression of
disease in this current case was less aggressive than the cases in 1997.
However the clinical features also suggest brain stem, especially vasomotor
center involvement - tachycardia, transient hypertension, severe
vasoconstriction and LV dysfunction.
Since August 2000, the Department of Medical Microbiology, Universiti Malaya
Medical Centre, has received over 600 samples from 221 suspected HFMD cases,
the majority (206 cases in October) coming from the State of Johor. The
number of hospitals sending samples were Johor (11), Kedah (2), Melaka (1),
Negeri Sembilan (1), Sabah (1), Selangor (2) and the Federal Territory (3).
Coxsackie A16 virus and Enterovirus 71 have been isolated from several cases
of mild HFMD. A different enterovirus was isolated from 2 patients with
severe CNS manifestations and 2 fatal cases seen at [different hospitals.
This isolate stained positive by immunofluorescence using a commercial
pan-enterovirus blend, but did not react with other enterovirus pools, which
included [reagents for detection of Coxsackie A16 virus and Enterovirus 71.
Further identification of this enterovirus by neutralization and molecular
sequencing is in progress.

Cause of Outbreak Still Elusive
-------------------------------
KUALA LUMPUR: Health officials in Malaysia suspect a new virus strain to be
the cause of 3 deaths related to hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in
the country last month. To ascertain and isolate the virus which has also
caused an upsurge in the number of HFMD cases in the country, blood samples
from the 3 victims have been sent to the Princess Margaret Hospital in
Perth, Australia, for tests. Universiti Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC)
microbiologist Dr Chua Kaw Bing left for Perth over the weekend for
consultations and to conduct tests with experts there.
He revealed last week that the enterovirus extracted by the UMMC team so far
seemed to be related to one known as Enterovirus type 71, which was found to
have been responsible for the HFMD-related outbreak in Sarawak in 1997 which
killed more than 30 children. In the Sarawak case, a series of sudden infant
deaths occurred against a background of a large outbreak of HFMD in the
state. The deaths were suspected [initially to have been caused by a rare
strain of Coxsackie virus, [because most of the victims had a history of
HFMD, but died of acute heart failure. But after calling in foreign experts,
including those from Atlanta's Centers for Disease Control, authorities were
able to identify the Enterovirus 71 as the cause of that epidemic.
Health Ministry Disease Control Division principal assistant director Dr
Devan Kurup had said earlier that Enterovirus 71 was suspected to be the
cause this time. But officials are now looking at the possibility of a new
strain as well.

Enterovirus 71 from Malaysia & Singapore distinct from Taiwan virus
-------------------------------------------------------------------
SINGAPORE: Scientists have shortened the time it takes to test for viruses
which may cause hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). Currently, it takes
anywhere from 2 to 3 weeks from the time the symptoms are noticed to
confirming the viruses responsible. The National University of Singapore
researchers have found a way to cut the time needed to just 2 to 3 days, and
are working on getting the detective work done on the same day.
The recent virus scare saw more than 1725 people infected with the mild but
contagious disease. The Department of Microbiology's Enterovirus 71 Research
Team has been looking into tests for the viruses, called enteroviruses, for
more than 2 years. [Infection with these viruses may [produce symptoms
seen in illnesses like the [common cold and HFMD. Some may cause
inflammation of the heart and brain.
The NUS team, which had help from Singapore General Hospital, tested for the
virus by applying a molecular typing process, which analyses the molecular
structure of the virus. By doing so, the virus could be diagnosed more
quickly. Associate Professor Poh Chit Laa, the team's principal
investigator, said it had been able to directly isolate the virus. Prof Poh
said while the Enterovirus 71 strains isolated in Singapore and Malaysia
were similar, they were different from one [previously isolatedin Taiwan.

[The first of these 3 reports is the most informative and precise. The
accumulating evidence indicates that Enterovirus type 71 infection is a
major factor in the concurrent epidemics of HFMD in Malaysia and Singapore.
However, there is now evidence that in Malaysia another, as yet
unidentified, enterovirus may be associated with the more severe forms of
the disease. HFMD has been considered a rather benign infection of
childhood, but since 1974 there have been several outbreaks in South East
and East Asia which have been accompanied by some deaths. Following the
outbreak in Malaysia in 1997 in which 28 children died, a well-organised
clinical surveillance system was established in Taiwan on the initiative of
Professor Monto Ho (see Ho et al., N.Engl. J.Med. 1999, 341, 929-935). This
surveillance system was in place in time to follow the course of the
largest recorded HFMD epidemic which may have affected as many as 1 484 000
people with 78 deaths in Taiwan during 1998. Among patients from whom a
virus was isolated, Enterovirus 71 was isolated from 49% of outpatients
with uncomplicated HFMD, from 75% of hospitalised patients who survived,
and from 92% of patients who died. Most of those who died were young (5
years of age or less) and the majority died of pulmonary edema and
pulmonary hemorrhage. However, although Enterovirus 71 appeared to be
associated with the most severe disease, other viruses were present.
Virological analysis of the current outbreak in Malaysia and Singapore may
help to clarify the relative roles of different enteroviruses in the
manifestation of HFMD. - Mod.CP
