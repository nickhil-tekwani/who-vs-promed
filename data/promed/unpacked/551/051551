A 9-year-old Florida School for the Deaf and the Blind student was
eager to get back to class Tuesday afternoon [1 Nov 2011] after a
raccoon attacked and bit her several times on campus.

School spokeswoman Miki Gilloon said the girl was with a group of
other students who stopped at a playground on their way back to the
dorms around 6:30 p.m. Monday [31 Oct 2011]. The group had just come
back from dance lessons, Gilloon said, and "some wanted to go to the
swings and whatnot."

"Some of the students were in a small group, and she was off doing
something else, and all of a sudden, this raccoon ran up to her,"
Gilloon said. "It bit her 8 times." She said the girl had puncture
wounds on her hands and between her toes. She said the staff took
quick action, making sure she was OK and calling campus police.

St. Johns County Fire Rescue spokesman Jeremy Robshaw said the girl
was taken to Flagler Hospital in stable condition. Gilloon said she
was vaccinated as a precaution and released to the school's health
center. "The president of the school visited with her this morning [2
Nov 2011]," she said. "She wanted to go back to classes so bad, and
she wanted to tell all her friends as well."

Robshaw said it would be nearly impossible to identify the raccoon
that bit the girl, but said county Animal Control had caught some
raccoons. The raccoons will not be tested because one in every 3 would
come up positive for rabies.

The attack makes the 2nd in the downtown area in as many years. In May
2010, a rabid raccoon attacked and bit an 11-year-old girl 3 times in
the courtyard of Memorial Presbyterian Church on Sevilla Street, where
she was attending a St. Augustine Children's Chorus practice. The area
went under a rabies alert for 2 months.

In December [2010], the county Health Department issued a 60-day alert
for an area near Ponce Golf Club after a feral cat tested positive for
the disease.

[It appears from the attacking raccoon's behavior that it was rabid,
but the animal was not captured, and this has to be assumed. It is
estimated that 1/3rd of the raccoons in this area of Florida may be
rabid.

The victim appears to have been given immediate treatment, and,
provided the rabies post-exposure vaccination schedule is adhered to,
the victim of the attack should be protected. This is the 2nd
encounter between a child and a rabid raccoon in this area in the past
2 years.

The Florida School for the Deaf and the Blind is located in the town
of Saint Augustine, St. John's county, Florida. It is the largest
school of its type in the United States. The school has grown from 3
small buildings on 5 acres to 47 major buildings on nearly 80 acres of
land. The location of St. John's County can be found in the map at:
