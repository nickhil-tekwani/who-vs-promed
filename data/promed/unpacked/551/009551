South Korea in mass cull over foot-and-mouth disease
----------------------------------------------------
South Korea on Sunday [11 Apr 2010] began culling almost 30 000 farm
animals in a bid to contain the highly contagious foot-and-mouth
disease [FMD] following its outbreak 2 days ago, officials said. The
disease hit a cattle farm in Ganghwa, some 40 km (25 miles) west of
Seoul, last Friday [9 Apr 2010] and has since infected 4 more farms
nearby, they said.

Ganghwa county spokesman Bae Hung-Kyu said animals on 227 farms
within 3 km of contaminated farms would be killed. The planned cull
was much bigger than the agriculture ministry's Saturday announcement
that about 16 000 livestock at 140 farms would be slaughtered. Bae
said the rapid spread of the disease meant the cull had to be larger
than originally planned.

FMD affects animals such as cattle, pigs, deer, goats and sheep. The
virus can be spread between animals, through the air and on clothing.
However, it is rarely transmitted to humans.

South Korea ordered a halt to pork and beef exports in January this
year when an outbreak of the disease was confirmed in Pocheon,
northeast of Seoul [see comment].

Outbreaks in 2000 and 2002 cost South Korea an estimated 450 billion
won (400 million dollars).

[This epizootic, caused by FMDV serotype O, dserves to be regarded as
unrelated to the previous one which was caused by serotype A and
declared as resolved. Most probably, serotype O has been introduced
more recently; it is a more invasive virus type and clinically
affects multiple species. Its (not yet identified) source and route
of introduction are a matter of concern. - Mod.AS]
