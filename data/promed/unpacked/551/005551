Cassava is a staple crop grown throughout central and southern Africa.
Losses to cassava production occur in all areas due to cassava mosaic
disease (CMD), caused by various begomoviruses (family _Geminiviridae_).
During the 1990s a particularly severe CMD pandemic spread through Uganda
and into surrounding countries, including Kenya. The severity of the
pandemic was attributed to a synergistic interaction between African
cassava mosaic virus (ACMV) and a recombinant strain of East African
cassava mosaic virus (EACMV), known as the Uganda variant (EACMV-UG; Zhou
et al., 1997).
Recently Maruthi et al. (2001) showed the presence of an additional
begomovirus species, East African cassava mosaic Zanzibar virus (EACMZV) on
the island of Zanzibar.
Cassava stem cuttings were collected in Kenya during 1999. EACMV was found
in coastal areas from Kilifi to Kwale. 4 symptomatic cassava samples failed
to produce products in diagnostic PCR. For these samples, DNA A-specific
primers (virion-sense 5'-GGTACCACATGTTGACGCGCTCCACTACTT-3',
complementary-sense 5'-GGTACCATTGTTAAACGATTTCCCTGAA-3') were designed from
the sequence of PCR products produced with genus-specific primers (Deng et
al., 1994).
The full-length PCR product was cloned into pQA (Qiagen) and sequenced
(EMBL Acc. No. AJ516003). The DNA A component is 2784 nt in length and
shows the arrangement of genes typical of Old World bipartite begomoviruses
(Stanley and Gay, 1983). It is most similar to EACMZV (96.4 percent
nucleotide identity) and closely related to other CMD-associated
begomoviruses including EACMV-Tanzania (85 percent) and EACMV-UG (83.4
percent).
The virus isolate from coastal Kenya is a strain of EACMZV which we
designate EACMZV-Kenya (EACMZV-KE). This virus may be widespread along the
coast of East Africa and probably diverged from other cassava-infecting
begomoviruses due to geographic isolation.
The cassava-growing region of coastal Kenya is separated from cultivated
areas inland by an arid belt which does not support intensive agriculture.
This suggests that there has been little, if any, movement of cassava and
associated viruses between these 2 regions, thus protecting the coastal
belt from the severe CMD pandemic and allowing EACMZV-KE to be maintained.

[This report documents the appearance of a new strain of EACMZV begomovirus
and underscores the evolution of new viruses/strains in Africa. The
original virus isolate was described in 1998, and subsequent
characterization of the isolate shows that it is a Kenyan strain of EACMZV.
CMD is a major factor limiting production of cassava across a wide area of
Africa, and is a contributing factor to food insecurity among the peoples
of several countries on the continent. - Mod.DH]
