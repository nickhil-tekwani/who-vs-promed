The number of incidents of infection is 5-fold compared with that in
2010. A total of 25 individuals have caught measles in Finland so far
this year [2011]. This may not sound like a lot, but the number is 5
times higher than the documented cases who contracted the illness in
the whole of 2010, when the number of infections was only 5. The most
recent incidents are from August 2011, when 5 individuals were
diagnosed with the illness in the Finnish Defence Forces. The
infections had been contracted at the Finnish National Defence
University and the School of Naval Warfare. All infected individuals
had previously served in the same place, where one person had come
down with measles after having made a trip to Europe, passing the
disease on to the 4 other people.

The previous cluster of measles infections was detected in the spring
and early summer when 20 people came down with the illness in the
Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa.

As a result of the infections, the National Institute for Health and
Welfare (THL) decided that the inoculation of small children against
measles should be started earlier than before. The vaccine is
administered in 2 shots, the 1st of which is now given to children
around the age of one year. Even a 6-month-old child can be vaccinated
if he or she is about to travel abroad.

Last spring [2011], the Finnish Defence Forces advised all conscripts
and staff to make sure that they have received both doses of the MMR
vaccine. If the 2nd dose was missing, they could have it administered
at the garrison's infirmary. All conscripts who started military
service in July [2011] were asked for information about their
vaccination coverage against measles. Most individuals' protection
against the illness was in order, reports the Defence Forces
epidemiologist Maria Virkki.

Measles had disappeared from Finland by the beginning of the 21st
century. All Finns born in the 1950s had already had measles, so had
also many of those born in the 1960s. Inoculation campaigns against
measles were launched at the beginning of the 1980s.

In the spring, many adults who had been born in the 1970s and been
left without protection were among those infected. The Finnish Defence
Forces see that the situation is a consequence of the anti-vaccination
attitudes in the 1990s. At that time, many parents questioned the
significance of the MMR vaccine, as it had been mistakenly linked with
autism.

It is possible that the number of infections will increase further, as
a severe epidemic is in progress in Central Europe, where more than 12
000 people have been hit with the illness. Cases of measles have been
detected particularly in Belgium, France, Spain, Serbia, Switzerland,
Macedonia, Great Britain, and Uzbekistan. The infected individuals
have been either children aged 1-4 years or young people between 15
and 29, missing one or both doses of the vaccine.

The University of Exeter and health experts are urging students to
ensure before that when they attend university they have been
vaccinated against measles. Suspicion of a future outbreak of the
infection has been confirmed by data from the Health Protection Agency
(HPA), which shows that the number of measles cases this year [2011]
has more than doubled the complete number of cases of measles
infection from last year.

There were 777 cases of measles by the end of July this year [2011] in
comparison to just 374 measles infections for the entire 2010 period.
The largest number of cases has been among young adults under the age
of 25, which has led the HPA to consider new outbreaks of the measles
infection likely as students return to campuses across the country.
The organisation also stated that the cases confirmed so far amongst
this age group were associated with small groups of people in
universities and schools where many of the attendees had not been
vaccinated against the infection.

The University of Exeter Student Guild is also urging new or returning
students attending the campus this autumn season to check with their
GPs as to whether they have been vaccinated against measles. The Guild
also advises that if a student has not been vaccinated against the
infection, they should be aware of the initial symptoms of the illness
and are urged that if concerned that they may have the infection to
contact their GP or the Student Health Centre.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/8776987/European-measles-outbreak-spreads-to-Britain.html


The Health Protection Agency (HPA) has released figures showing that
across England and Wales, there were 777 laboratory-confirmed cases in
the 1st 7 months of 2010, compared to 374 for all of 2010. In the 1st
7 months of 2010, there were 208 confirmed cases.

Most of those affected have been children and young adults. In many
cases, the sources of local outbreaks are thought to have been people
who travelled to Europe on holiday. France, Spain, Germany and
Switzerland have experienced major outbreaks this year [2011], each
recording thousands of cases. All saw immunisation rates for the
measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine plummet after 1998, when The
Lancet published a small study linking it with autism and bowel
disorders.

The study has since been comprehensively dismissed as seriously
flawed. Immunisation rates in Britain have only recently recovered,
earlier this year [2011] breaking the 90 per cent mark for the 1st
time in 13 years. The legacy of the Lancet study means many older
children and young people remain unprotected, as they never received
the vaccine. Two jabs are required to offer full protection. They are
usually given at a year and about 3.5 years, although they can be
given in 2 stages to older children and adults.

Dr Mary Ramsay, the HPA's head of the immunisation, said: "Measles and
meningitis are infections that can both be fatal; it is absolutely
vital that all students [entering universities] ensure they are
completely up to date with all their vaccinations, especially the MMR
and Men C vaccine. University bars and campuses where lots of students
are in close proximity are ideal places for bacteria and viruses to
spread, which is why we may see more outbreaks of these infections in
this environment."

We are being urged to get the MMR jab for our children following an
outbreak of measles in Surrey. New figures show there were 115 cases
in Surrey and Sussex in the 1st 6 months of this year [2011]. That's
more than double the number for the whole of last year.

Dr Angela Iversen is from the Surrey and Sussex Health Protection Unit
and says the virus is spreading through un-vaccinated children: "Quite
a lot of that was linked to foreign travel to Europe where there are
some very large outbreaks of measles going on, particularly in France.
We know that the figures went down somewhat during the summer
holidays, but I am afraid that we have started to see some early signs
that we are getting a small number of cases back.

For the 1st time since 2007, Quebec is dealing with a wide scale
measles outbreak. More than 700 cases of the potentially deadly
disease have been reported in the province this year [2011], with the
majority of people being infected between April and July 2011,
although new infections are still being reported. Most of the people
infected live in the Mauricie region of the province, but the most
recent cases have been reported in the Eastern Townships.

Twelve percent of the infections have been so bad people needed to be
hospitalized for treatment. Measles can cause blindness, encephalitis,
pneumonia and death. Public health officials suspect the disease was
brought into Quebec by European visitors. They are urging parents to
get children vaccinated against the disease.

Vaccination rates against measles have dropped since 1998, when a
medical researcher faked research and falsely claimed there was a link
between a measles vaccine and autism. That research has since been
thoroughly discredited; the journal that published the study has
apologized, and the doctor involved has been stripped of his medical
license.

[edited]


On 26 Aug 2011, California public health officials notified CDC of a
suspected measles case in an unvaccinated male refugee aged 15 years
from Burma (the index patient), who had lived in an urban area of
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, which is experiencing ongoing measles
outbreaks. Currently, approximately 92 000 such refugees are living in
urban communities in Malaysia. Resettlement programs in the United
States and other countries are ongoing. The health and vaccination
status of urban refugees are largely unknown.

The index patient developed a fever on 21 Aug 2011 and a rash on 22
Aug 2011. He and his family (his mother and 2 siblings, aged 13 and 16
years) departed Malaysia on 24 Aug 2011 and arrived the same day in
Los Angeles, California, where they stayed overnight. He was
hospitalized for suspected measles on 25 Aug 2011. Serologic testing
for immunoglobulin M confirmed the diagnosis of measles on 30 Aug
2011. The sibling aged 16 years was unvaccinated and had onset of a
febrile rash illness in Malaysia on 18 Aug 2011. Serologic testing
performed on 30 Aug 2011 in Los Angeles indicated evidence of recent
measles infection. However, the sibling was not infectious during the
flight.

On 1 Sep 2011, Maryland public health officials notified CDC of
laboratory-confirmed cases of measles in 2 unvaccinated refugee
children (aged 7 months and 2 years) who were on the same flight as
the index patient. A suspected case of measles in an unvaccinated
refugee aged 14 years, who had traveled on the same flight, was
reported by North Carolina public health officials on 4 Sep 2011 and
confirmed on 9 Sep 2011. Whether these 3 patients were exposed to
measles in Malaysia or during travel to the United States is unclear.
On 7 Sep 2011, CDC was notified of another laboratory-confirmed case
in an unvaccinated refugee child aged 23 months from Burma who
traveled from Malaysia to Wisconsin through Los Angeles on 24 Aug
2011, but on a different flight than the index patient.

31 refugees who traveled from Malaysia on the same flight with the
index patient on 24 Aug 2011 arrived in the following 7 states:
Maryland, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Texas, Washington,
and Wisconsin. State and local health departments and CDC were
contacted and initiated contact investigations and response
activities. As of 12 Sep 2011, contact investigations and heightened
surveillance had revealed 3 additional laboratory-confirmed measles
cases that were epidemiologically linked to the index patient: one
case in a U.S. Customs and Border Protection Officer with unknown
vaccination status who processed the index patient in the Los Angeles
airport (reported by California public health officials on 8 Sep
2011), and 2 cases in non-refugee, unvaccinated children (aged 12
months and 19 months) who were seated 9 rows from the index patient
during the flight (reported by California public health officials on 9
Sep 2011).

Rapid control efforts by state and local public health agencies have
been a key factor in limiting the size of this outbreak and preventing
the spread of measles in communities with increased numbers of
unvaccinated persons. To prevent measles transmission and importation
in this refugee population, refugee travel from Malaysia to the United
States was temporarily suspended. CDC recommended that 1) U.S.-bound
refugees in Malaysia without evidence of measles immunity be
vaccinated with measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and their
travel be postponed for 21 days after vaccination; 2) refugees
arriving in the United States receive their post-arrival health
examinations as soon as feasible; 3) clinicians consider measles as a
diagnosis in a refugee with a febrile rash illness and clinically
compatible symptoms (i.e., cough, coryza, and/or conjunctivitis); 4)
patients with suspected measles be isolated and appropriate specimens
be obtained for measles confirmation and virus genotyping; and 5)
cases be reported promptly to local health departments. To prevent
measles in U.S. residents at home and abroad, CDC recommends that
eligible persons without evidence of measles immunity be vaccinated as
recommended. Before international travel, infants aged 6-11 months
should receive one MMR vaccine dose, and persons aged over 12 months
should receive 2 doses unless they have other evidence of measles
immunity.

As of Monday [19 Sep 2011], there were 28 reported cases of measles in
2011, according to the California Department of Public Health. That is
the highest incidence since 2001, when 40 people reported having
measles. There were 9 cases in all of 2009 and 27 cases in 2010.

Of the cases reported this year [2011], 22 of the 28 were not
vaccinated or very likely to lack the vaccine. More than half had
recently traveled internationally, including to Europe, where
vaccination rates have dropped and measles cases have risen.

"We are quite concerned in California, as is I believe the rest of the
country about increasing cases of measles," said Gil Chavez, deputy
director of the department's Center for Infectious Diseases. "Even one
single case that is acquired oversees can expose a lot of individuals
when they come back home and in the airplane."

Measles can cause ear infections, pneumonia, diarrhea, brain injuries
and death. The vaccine, which was introduced in 1963, is free or
low-cost for those who cannot afford it.

The high incidence is concerning to health officials, who worry that
individual cases could lead to outbreaks in schools and communities.
In 2008, a 7-year-old boy who had not been vaccinated triggered an
outbreak in San Diego. The number of non-vaccinated children has
continued to grow over the last decade, as parents fear that
vaccinations could cause autism, a belief repeatedly disproved in
scientific literature. To opt out of the vaccine, parents simply fill
out a form.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says Milwaukee's
measles alert began when an unvaccinated 23-month-old refugee from
Burma flew to the city from Malaysia. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel
reports that the child flew to Wisconsin on 24 Aug 2011 and was
reported to have laboratory-confirmed measles on 7 Sep 2011. Since
then, measles has been confirmed in 2 more people in Milwaukee. Paul
Biedrzycki, the city's director of disease control and environmental
health, says both of those people appear to have acquired the disease
through exposure to the refugee patient.

Biedrzycki says Milwaukee health workers are working with refugee
resettlement agencies to identify and control the spread of measles.

Bay of Plenty health officials are urging people to check whether they
are immunised against measles, as an outbreak of the disease continues
to spread nationally.

In the last week, there has been a surge in the number of people
infected with the disease, with 45 reported cases, including one in
the Bay of Plenty, taking the total number of confirmed cases since
May 2011 to 167 [nationally].

Bay of Plenty District Health Board medical officer of health Dr Phil
Shoemack says people should be getting their children immunised and be
aware of coming into contact with anyone if they, or their children,
are not immunised. Vaccination is the best way to protect against
measles with the Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) vaccine available, given
in 2 doses, normally at 15 months and 4 years of age.

Dr Shoemack says the immunisation rate in the Bay of Plenty is
improving, although it has not reached the 95 per cent target.

The number of cases in New Zealand is continuing to grow, particularly
in the Auckland region, where 27 contacts are currently in quarantine.
Health officials say many people have come into contact with the
measles on domestic flights and are warning anyone who is planning to
travel to check their immunisation status 1st.

Dr Shoemack says there has been one confirmed case of the measles in
the Bay of Plenty, and that was an overseas visitor who is now back in
their home country.

A female Canterbury University student has been diagnosed with the
disease [measles] after travelling to Auckland recently. Almost 150
cases have already been confirmed in Auckland. Canterbury medical
officer of Health Dr Ramon Pink says there may be a link with Rugby
World Cup 2011 travel. "With the accelerated number of cases over the
last couple of days in Auckland, I think that there is increased risk
of seeing more measles cases down in the south and in the Christchurch
area," he says.

Dr Pink says the key to preventing an outbreak in the south is for
people to look out for early signs: a fever, runny nose and
conjunctivitis.

Health officials battling to contain an outbreak of measles have found
infected people have travelled on another 2 domestic flights. They
were Air New Zealand afternoon flights that left Auckland for
Wellington at 12.30 pm on Friday 9 Sep 2011 and a 2:30 pm flight from
Wellington to Auckland last Saturday 24 Sep 2011. Passengers on those
flights are being urged to immediately check their immune status and
that of their children.

It's already been revealed infected people have in the past 3 weeks
travelled on 4 flights between Auckland and Wellington, and one
between Christchurch and Auckland.

There have been a total of 167 confirmed cases of measles in the
Auckland region in the past 6 months, 24 of which required
hospitalisation. 27 people are in quarantine.
