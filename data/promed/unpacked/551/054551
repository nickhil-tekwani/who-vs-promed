Saint Vincent's agriculture officials say they are anxiously awaiting
word from a United Kingdom laboratory, about the identity of a
disease affecting bananas for the last 2 years. Minister of
Agriculture, Montgomery Daniel, said the identity of the disease was
still unknown, but experts were brought in twice to look at the
situation and samples were sent to laboratories in the UK and the
United States for tests. He said the mysterious disease had been
mainly affecting tissue culture bananas but had also been [detected]
in older plants.
The Minister noted that while the mysterious disease had been killing
some plants, other plants within the same fields where the infection
was detected were growing and bearing well.
Mr. Daniel added that the battle with the disease had not affected
banana exports. He also added that, in the interim, experts at the
Ministry of Agriculture had analyzed the situation and were
systematically destroying the infected plants by burning and using a herbicide.

St Vincent and the Grenadines Opposition Leader, Arnhim Eustace,
touched on the ailing banana industry, stating prices have fallen
and, for more than a year, there is an unidentified disease that is
plaguing farmers here.
"I am aware that only recently a team was brought to Saint Vincent
and the Grenadines to identify this disease. Why did it take so long?
The results of the tests have not yet been reported but indications
are, from reliable sources, that the disease displays the
characteristics of the dreaded Moko disease, which destroys plants
almost overnight," Eustace said.
He added the government and the Banana Growers Association remained
silent on the matter, stating that every effort must be made to
identify more expeditiously the nature of the disease and to keep the
farming community informed.

[While test results are still outstanding, speculation appears to be
rife as to what causes this mystery disease. A source for the claim
that the symptoms resemble Moko disease is not provided and this
needs to be confirmed. Alternatively, the remark that the disease
'mainly affects tissue culture bananas but had also been detected in
older plants', as well as the reported patchy distribution, may point
towards a different problem. In the meantime, the immediate removal
and burning of diseased plants is a good practical response.
Two banana diseases have been reported earlier from the Caribbean:
Moko disease, a bacterial wilt caused by a member of the _Ralstonia
solanacearum_ species complex; and Black Sigatoka, a fungal disease
caused by _Mycosphaerella fijiensis_.
