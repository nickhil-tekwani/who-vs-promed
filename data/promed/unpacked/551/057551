[re: Hantavirus - Americas (47): Panama (LS)]
---------------------------------------------
We agree with the moderator stating that Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS (hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome) or "hantavirus fever". However, "hantavirus fever," or rather "a fever induced by hantavirus" ("una fiebre por virus hanta"), as mentioned in the 11 Aug 2018 edition of La Prensa/Provincias, should also include the 1st hantaviral pathogen isolated in the New World, being rat-transmitted Seoul virus (SEOV) (LeDuc JW, Smith GA, Johnson KM. Hantaan-like viruses from domestic rats captured in the United States. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 1984;33:992-98).

The description of the living conditions of the Panama "hantavirus fever" cases was suggestive indeed for possible home infestation by "rodents," in this case probably wild rats.

The 1st published account of clinically and serologically proven human hantavirus infections in the New World were also 8/156 (5.1 per cent) hospitalized acute kidney injury (AKI) cases with thrombocytopenia, originally considered as being leptospirosis after rat-exposure, but appearing in fact to be SEOV-induced HFRS (hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome) (Hinrichsen S, Medeiros de Andrade A, Clement J, et al. Evidence of hantavirus infection in Brazilian patients from Recife with suspected leptospirosis. Lancet 1993;341:50).

SEOV-infected rats have been found since the early 80s worldwide on 4 continents, including in the Americas, with prevalence repeatedly reaching 50 per cent or more in some American cities like Baltimore, MD and leading to the 1987 isolation of "Baltmore rat virus" (BRV) (Childs JE, Korch GW, Glass GE, et al. Epizootiology of hantavirus infections in Baltimore: isolation of a virus from Norway rats, and characteristics of infected rat populations. Am J Epidemiol. 1987;126(1):55-68). Nevertheless, the paucity of registered cases of SEOV-HFRS remains striking, with the USA having only 6 cases in the 1994-2012 period, for example.

SEOV-HFRS consists of acute kidney injury (AKI), microhematuria, and proteinuria, together with thrombocytopenia. Proteinuria and microhematuria, although transient, are considered moreover as severity indicators. A combination of massive proteinuria with microhematuria and AKI, was considered until recently a rare nephrological triad in previously healthy young adults, the latter constituting the bulk of HFRS cases in all reviews or mega-studies. AKI following acute tubulus necrosis (ATN), combined with massive proteinuria, is sometimes ascribed to the deleterious effect of NSAIDs. Indeed, NSAIDs are often prescribed for flu-like myalgiae heralding HFRS, thus obscuring the real ensuing cause of AKI. In other HFRS instances, however, tubular changes on kidney biopsy can be minimal ("tubulitis"), or even absent, thus perplexing the attending nephrologist, finding virtually no renal lesions in a younger patient with rapidly declining renal function, combined with frank proteinuria (Clement J. Acute kidney injury and hantavirus disease. In: Oxford textbook of clinical nephrology (OTCN), 4th edition. Eds. Turner N, Lameire N, Goldsmith D, et al. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK, 2015: pp. 2059-2066). The only possible differential nephrological diagnosis is perhaps an effect called minimal change disease (MCD), since likewise in this instance, no glomerular lesions are found in light microscopy or immunofluorescence, and full-blown ATN is rare. However, other biochemical HFRS hallmarks, like hyponatremia, highly elevated levels of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein, plus the often diagnostic thrombocytopenia, are lacking in MCD.

Besides sometimes pronounced abdominal complaints, intense bilateral lumbalgiae are often a distinctive sign, heralding HFRS. These lumbalgiae are due to inflammatory kidney swelling, easily assessed by echography, showing often a longitudinal renal diameter of over 12 cm, together with 3rd space effusions (pleuritis, pericarditis, ascites, etc.), all symptoms due to transient capillary hyperpermeability, the main pathophysiological mechanism in all hantavirus infections, HPS included.

SEOV-HFRS should seriously be considered as a credible alternative for the 5 out of 6 "non-HPS hantavirus fever" forms in the current (and previous?) 2018 Panama cases. Rapid straightforward sero-diagnosis can be hampered, however, by the fact that local laboratory confirmation is relying too much on the increased use of commercial IFA or ELISA formats, containing only PUUV (in Europe) or SNV/ANDV (in the Americas) antigens, which have little cross-reactivity with SEOV. In such cases, SEOV-HFRS can be missed, even when the attending physician thinks of the possibility of an acute hantavirus infection.

[Dr Clement raises an important point about the need to consider Seoul hantavirus in cases of hantavirus infection in the Americas, including Panama, and a test that can diagnose both Seoul and Choclo virus should be employed.

It is true that both black (_Rattus rattus_) and brown or Norway (_Rattus norveigicus_) rats, the hosts of Seoul virus, can be found in buildings in the tropics. In Panama, the rodent host of Choclo virus, the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), can be found in houses and other buildings and nearby agricultural fields. When field epidemiological investigations are made of the Panama cases of HPS and hantavirus fever, it would be of interest to test rodents of these 3 species for the presence of hantaviruses. Just because SEOV has not been detected in Panama does not mean it is not there (remembering the adage that "the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence").

Clinicians in Panama, and elsewhere in the Americas, will be interested in the clinical features of SEOV-HFS that Dr Clement describes above when attending cases of hantavirus infection. - Mod.TY
