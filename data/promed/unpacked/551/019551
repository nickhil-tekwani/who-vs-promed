In its latest bulletin, the Cell for Interregional Epidemiology (CIRE), Indian Ocean, reported 38 cases of leptospirosis since the beginning of the year in Reunion. It is much more than the number of cases occurring in the same period last year (20 cases), but much less than that shown in the data from 2010 (52 cases), and finally, it is average for recent years.

These seasonal outbreaks of leptospirosis are probably related to the rainfall. As emphasized by CIRE, “The rains were late this year, averaging three times more in March this year, than in March last year.

"This illness is transmitted by the urine of animals infected with _Leptospira_ [bacteria] (rats, dogs, and tangue [AKA tenrec]). Bacteria can remain several months in a humid and hot environment. Carried by the water, the bacteria will then enter (the body of humans or animals) through mucous membranes or wounds. Four to fourteen days after infection, a Dengue-like syndrome will appear (high fever, muscle aches, joint pain, and headache). The disease may progress to involve the liver causing jaundice, kidneys, lungs, meninges, and in 20% of cases it is complicated by a hemorrhagic syndrome.

Nevertheless, the patients, mostly men aged between 14 and 74, were all hospitalized for a period ranging from one to 32 days. Nearly half of them even made an ICU stay. "The cases are spread throughout the island with a predominance in the north-east of the department with 43% of cases in the east, 24% in the north, 18% in the west and 14% in the south”, CIRE said.

Contrary to popular belief, the sugar cane cutters are not the only people likely to be affected by leptospirosis. Nine people were infected through outdoor recreation, five out of activities related to living and five others in recreational freshwater. To avoid contamination, it is recommended to protect oneself by wearing boots and gloves in a hazardous activity (agriculture, livestock, gardening, freshwater fishing, hunting ...). It is also best to avoid swimming when one has sores, walking in fresh water, and simply walking barefoot or in open shoes on the muddy ground.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that is distributed widely throughout the world in warm climates and is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. These animals are mostly asymptomatic, but chronically infected with one of the several hundred serovars of pathogenic _Leptospira_. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions. In carrier animals with chronic renal infections, leptospiruria persists for long periods or for life. _Leptospira_ bacteria shed in urine may survive in water or moist soil for weeks to months. Many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rodents) are susceptible to chronic urinary infection with pathogenic leptospira.

Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for rat infestation in urban settings. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.

The tangue, also known as the tailless tenrec (_Tenrec ecaudatus_), mentioned in the news report above, is a species of mammal, found in subtropical or tropical forests, savanna, shrubland, pastureland, plantations, rural gardens, and urban areas in Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, Seychelles, and Réunion (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailless_tenrec).

Réunion, one of the overseas departments of France, is an island with a population of about 800,000 located in the Indian Ocean, east of Madagascar, about 200 kilometres (120 mi) south west of Mauritius, the nearest island.
