[The following additional information about this outbreak has been
provided. - Mod.ES
The epidemic is in a remote, militarily restricted area. It has not been
well investigated. Reports coming out describe frequent epistaxis. Often
neck stiffness, suspected encephalitis about 5 - 7 days after onset of
illness. Neck stiffness resolves, coma ensues, and death occurs at 7 - 10
days. No reports of jaundice. Yellow fever suspicion is based solely on
"nothing better to explain the reported deaths" at this point.

Per request of Jack Woodall, I ran the following past GIDEON:
Sudan, case cluster, stiff neck, coma, epistaxis...no jaundice.
GIDEON give highest ranking to Ebola, followed by typhoid, Crimean Congo
hemorrhagic fever and yellow fever. Although this clinical picture is
compatible with meningococcal meningitis, epistaxis would not be expected
in multiple victims.
A focus of Ebola once existed in southern Sudan (Juba and Maridi), with
outbreaks in 1976 (284 cases - 151 fatal) and 1979 (34 cases - 22 fatal).
