The Mississippi State Board of Animal Health has confirmed more than 10
cases in horses. As yet no human cases have been reported.
The affected counties are: Alcorn, Clarke, George, Greene, Harrison,
Lauderdale, Lincoln, Newton, Pearl River, Scott, Smith, & Winston.
The board has set up checkpoints on the Mississippi-Louisiana border where
compliance officers are ensuring that only animals with licenses come into
the state. The Mississippi (MS) law requires that owners of cattle and
horses have permits when entering the state. Sick animals would not be
permitted by an examining veterinarian.

[It might be wiser if the MS board insisted on all incoming horses had
proof of prior EEE vaccination as the previous emu outbreak in Brookhaven
was in June and it is now well established. In Louisiana there is an
unconfirmed report of two more human cases, one in Iberville; the previous
human cases are now recovering. A CDC team is visiting the state. - MHJ

When Meridian, Mississippi, veterinarian David Newell got a call last
weekend about a sick horse, he knew the trouble and knew there wasn't much
he could do. The 26-year veterinarian and others across Mississippi are
dealing with a worsening eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) outbreak.
The state Board of Animal Health has confirmed more than 10 cases in
horses. The disease is spread by infected mosquitoes and causes a serious
brain infection. Humans can also be infected.
Newell said he knows of at least one other animal case in his county,
Lauderdale, in the past month.
Other counties where officials know animal problems exist are Alcorn,
Clarke, George, Greene, Harrison, Lincoln, Newton, Pearl River, Scott,
Smith, and Winston. Most of the cases involve horses, but in the Brookhaven
area a number of emus were infected in June.
The last human case in Mississippi was in 1993. In Louisiana, there have
been 2 cases of the virus confirmed in humans this year, while 47 cases
have been confirmed in horses.
A Mississippi Board of Animal Health spokesman said checkpoints have been
set up at some roads along the Mississippi-Louisiana line, where compliance
officers are ensuring only animals with licenses come into the state.
Officer Joe Pigott said the law requires owners have permits for animals
such as cattle and horses to enter Mississippi. He said sick animals would
not receive permits from an examining veterinarian.
The disease cannot be transmitted from animals to people or between
animals. Newell said the virus is usually fatal in animals.
Dr. Fred Lehman, a veterinarian at Mississippi State University, said that
is frustrating for veterinarians, particularly because the virus can be
prevented with vaccinations.
"Veterinarians like to be able to treat, and this is a disease where
intervention is not very productive. Occasionally one will surive, but that
is rare," he said.
Because there is no known effective treatment, the state Department of
Health recommends that Mississippians try to avoid mosquitos, wear insect
repellant and stay inside during evening hours.
