On 21 Aug 9 cases [clusters] of mushroom poisoning were registered in
Nizhniy Novgorod. There are 13 people involved, including 3 children, ages
4, 12 and 14 years, as informed in Territorial management Rospotrebnadzor
(Federal Service on Surveillance of Consumer Rights and Human Well-being).
Inhabitants of Nizhni Novgorod, Kctovo and Balakhna are among the victims.
In all cases, the cause of the poisoning was fried mushrooms, which
included russula, honey agarics (_Armillaria mellea_) and _Boletus
luridus_. Those affected are in mild to serious condition.
All patients have been hospitalized in the toxicological branch of hospital
33, infectious departments of regional hospitals and in children's city
hospital 1 and are now receiving medical treatment.
So far in 2006 in Nizhniy Novgorod, 12 cases of food poisoning have been
recorded, including 3 cases of botulism, connected to the use of domestic
canned meat.

[Nizhniy Novgorod is located in the central part of the East European
plain. Regional centre: Nizhniy Novgorod, Distance from Nizhniy Novgorod to
Moscow - 439 km. Population (2002) - 3.6 million. - Mod.NP]
[A map of the area may be found at

A photograph of the honey mushroom (_Armillaria mellea_ may be found at
<http://www.mykoweb.com/CAF/species/Armillaria_mellea.html>. Generally this
mushroom is considered to be edible.
However, _Boletus luridus_ is considered by some to be poisonous, and
photos may be found at <http://alphagamma.150m.com/Boletus_luridus.html>
To the untrained eye, these may be difficult to distinguish between,
especially when they are growing in close proximity in the wild.
There are several different websites regarding these two fungi. Boletus is
not mentioned in my books regarding fungi, and the only website I found
called it toxic. If that is the case, am unaware of what the toxic agent is
or the symptoms and signs it may cause. - Mod.TG]
