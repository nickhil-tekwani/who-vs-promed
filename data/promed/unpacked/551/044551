More small poultry flocks have tested positive in the regional district of Peace River, district municipality of Sechelt and the town of Summerland. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) confirmed the positive test results on Tuesday [7 Jun 2022] and says the infected premises have been placed under quarantine. British Columbia's Ministry of Agriculture and Food has notified other producers within a 10 kilometre [6.21 mi] radius of the positive test results.

Owners of small or backyard flocks are urged to continue to be vigilant and have the appropriate measures in place to prevent the virus from infecting their animals. This can include reducing opportunities for poultry to encounter wild birds, reducing human access to the flock and increasing cleaning where the flocks are housed.

BC's Ministry of Agriculture and Food say they are continuing to work with the CFIA and BC poultry producers to ensure enhanced prevention and preparedness measures are in place.

The first confirmation of H5N1 in BC poultry was identified in the regional district of North Okanagan in April 2022. Wild birds have also tested positive for H5 strains of avian influenza in multiple regions of the province. The Wild Bird Mortality Investigation Program toll-free hotline, accepts reports of dead wild birds from the public.

A commercial egg laying flock in Weld County, Colorado, was infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza. The flock consisted of 1 928 000 hens. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), the presence of HPAI was confirmed on [7 Jun 2022].

This marks the 3rd case of HPAI in a commercial poultry flock in Colorado in 2022, and the 2nd in a commercial egg operation in the state. The virus was also confirmed in another Weld County layer flock on [29 Apr 2022], with the case involving 1 366 200 birds. HPAI was also confirmed in a commercial broiler breeder operation in Montrose County on [19 Apr 2022], with that case involving about 58 000 chickens. Colorado has also had confirmed cases of HPAI in 2 backyard flocks and at 1 animal rescue and rehabilitation center.

Prior to the most recent Weld County case, the last time a commercial flock in the US was affected by HPAI was [2 Jun 2022], when a commercial duck operation in Berks County, Pennsylvania was stricken. Berks County is also where the previously most recent case of HPAI in a commercial egg operation was confirmed. That case, which involved 79 000 hens, was confirmed on [17 May 2022].

With the latest HPAI case, the number of commercial birds affected by the virus in 2022 has reached 39 364 200.

So far in 2022, HPAI has been confirmed in commercial poultry in the states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Oklahoma, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, Kentucky, Indiana, Colorado, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and Utah. The virus has also been found in commercial game bird operations in Texas, New York and South Dakota.

[3] Oregon (Polk County): back yard flock

The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in a backyard flock of duck and geese in Polk County, Oregon. The flock's owner notified a private veterinarian after the sudden death of at least 1 bird; meanwhile, other birds in the flock were displaying clinical signs consistent with HPAI. The veterinarian sent a sample of the deceased bird to Oregon State University in Corvallis. A preliminary test came back positive for HPAI. NVSL made the official confirmation on [9 Jun 2022].

HPAI is a highly contagious virus transmitting easily among wild and domestic bird species. Signs include diarrhea, incoordination, lethargy, coughing and sneezing, and sudden death, although birds infected with HPAI may not always display outward signs of infection. The virus may spread in various ways, including through contact with infected wild and domestic birds and by contaminated equipment, clothing, and shoes of caretakers. The affected backyard flock in Polk County was known to co-mingle with wild birds at a nearby pond.

If you have domesticated backyard birds, please increase your biosecurity, and keep your birds separated from wild birds, especially waterfowl. The risk of HPAI to human health is low, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

If you see sick or dead wild birds, do not collect or handle them but report the incident directly to ODFW or <Wildlife.Health@odfw.oregon.gov>.

[Perhaps the summer heat is helping to reduce transmission of this disease. Perhaps the heat is having an effect on the virus. We know in many places the temperature is high and it is hard on the birds. However, it seems like avian influenza may be diminishing. I am cautiously optimistic the worst of this horrible disease is behind us.

We would all like our flocks to recover. But cautious optimism is no reason to let your guard down. Please keep up the biosecurity. - Mod.TG
