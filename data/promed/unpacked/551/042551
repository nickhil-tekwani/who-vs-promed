[2] Virus in vaginal secretions

Reyes Y, Bowman NM, Becker-Dreps S, et al. Prolonged Shedding of Zika Virus RNA in Vaginal Secretions, Nicaragua. Emerg Infect Dis. 2019; 25 (4):808-810. doi: 10.3201/eid2504.180977.

Abstract
Zika virus, an arthropod-borne flavivirus pathogen in humans, is unusual because it can be sexually transmitted and can be shed for prolonged periods in semen. We report viral shedding in vaginal secretions for up to 6 months, indicating the potential for sexual and vertical transmission by infected women.

Conclusions
Detection of Zika virus RNA in vaginal secretions 60-180 days after the onset of symptoms is a novel observation; the presence of Zika virus in vaginal secretions for under 6 months has crucial implications for couples planning pregnancy and for sexual transmission. In contrast to our results, in a population-based study of patients with symptomatic acute Zika virus infection followed for 6 months, only 1 of 50 women had Zika virus detectable in vaginal secretions, in a single specimen collected 3 dpo [days post onset] (4). The longest previously reported persistence of Zika virus RNA in vaginal secretions was 37 dpo (7); no other studies have detected Zika virus RNA in the reproductive tract for over 14 dpo (8). Shedding was intermittent in several patients in our study, so 1 negative specimen does not necessarily signify viral clearance. Most of our subjects were pregnant at enrollment; pregnant women are known to shed Zika virus in blood for up to 3 times longer than nonpregnant women, possibly because of fetal infection (9).

[There are few demonstrated instances of female to male sexual transmission of Zika virus. The above report of Zika virus RNA in vaginal secretions indicates that the risk of female to male sexual transmission may be greater than previously thought. However, presence of virus RNA in vaginal secretions does not necessarily indicate presence of infectious virus. - Mod.TY]

Vianna RAO, Lovero KL, Oliveira SA, et al. Children born to mothers with rash during Zika virus epidemic in Brazil: first 18 Months of Life. J Trop Pediatr. 2019 Apr 21. pii: fmz019. doi: 10.1093/tropej/fmz019

Abstract
Objective
To better understand the clinical spectrum and course of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) during the first 18 months of life of children whose mothers had rash during pregnancy.

Methods
This longitudinal observational study evaluated the clinical progress from birth until 18 months of life of children of mothers who developed rash during or up to 3 months before gestation. Maternal rash occurred from November 2015 to May 2017. The study subjects were divided into 3 groups: children whose mothers tested positive by RT-qPCR for Zika virus (ZIKV) (Group 1), children whose mothers tested negative by RT-qPCR for ZIKV (Group 2), and children whose mothers did not undergo any testing for ZIKV (Group 3) but tested negative for other congenital infections.

Results
Between April 2016 and July 2018, we studied 108 children: 43 in Group 1, 26 in Group 2 and 39 in Group 3. The majority of children were admitted into the study within 6 months of life. CZS was diagnosed in 26 children, equally distributed in Groups 1 and 3. Of 18 children with microcephaly, 6 were in Group 1 (1 postnatal) and 12 were in Group 3 (5 postnatal). Maternal rash frequency was 10 times higher during the 1st trimester than in the other trimesters (OR: 10.35; CI 95%: 3.52-30.41). CZS was diagnosed during the follow-up period in 14 (54%) cases. Developmental delays and motor abnormalities occurred in all children and persisted up to 18 months. Epilepsy occurred in 18 (69%) of the cases.

Conclusions
Infants born of mothers exposed to ZIKV during pregnancy showed progression of developmental, motor and neurologic abnormalities even if they were born asymptomatic. Continued postnatal monitoring of such newborns is necessary to preclude disability-associated complications.

[This study indicates that fetal Zika virus infection can result in disability of newborns with or without microcephaly. As the authors indicate, postnatal monitor is important in order to reduce complications. The adverse social and economic impact of CZS disabled children in affected families is doubtless serious and warrants study to provide an objective basis for provision of assistance. - Mod.TY]

[4] Vector competence

Zimler RA, Alto BW. Florida _Aedes aegypti_ (Diptera: Culicidae) and _Aedes albopictus_ vector competency for Zika virus. J Med Entomol. 2019 Feb 25;56(2):341-346. doi: 10.1093/jme/tjy231.

Abstract
Zika virus (ZIKV) first spread into Brazil in 2013 and is now present throughout the Americas. In 2016, Florida witnessed the beginnings of local ZIKV transmission. No reports of local transmission have been reported for 2018; however, travel related cases continue to be reported. Recurrence of local transmission in the United States is a major public health risk in Florida where vectors _Aedes aegypti_ (Diptera: Culicidae, Linnaeus) and _Aedes albopictus_ (Diptera: Culicidae, Skuse) are abundant and there is a high potential for virus reintroduction. A dose-response study was used to evaluate susceptibility and transmission potential of Florida _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ to ZIKV originating from Puerto Rico. Mosquitoes were orally exposed to one of 3 doses of ZIKV. Higher doses of infected blood resulted in overall greater infection rates in both mosquito species. _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ were susceptible to infection with ZIKV and revealed a significant species by dose interaction. At low doses, _Ae. aegypti_ was significantly less susceptible to infection with ZIKV than _Ae. albopictus_ (6.7% and 44.4%, respectively). In contrast, at high doses, _Ae. aegypti_ was significantly more susceptible to infection than _Ae. albopictus_ (75.8% and 53.8%, respectively). No significant differences were observed between _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ in disseminated infection (0-75%) and saliva infection (0-52.4%). These observations suggest greater susceptibility to infection for _Ae. albopictus_ at lower doses likely encountered by viremic humans. However, low disseminated infection and saliva infection for _Ae. albopictus_, combined with catholic feeding behavior, are likely to limit transmission potential relative to _Ae. aegypti_.

[_Ae aegypti_'s susceptibility and more strict human feeding habits make it the mosquito vector of greatest concern. This species is widely distributed in the world's tropical areas, bringing to those areas risk of Zika virus transmission. - Mod.TY]

Lei J, Vermillion MS, Jia B et al. IL-1 receptor antagonist therapy mitigates placental dysfunction and perinatal injury following Zika virus infection. JCI Insight. 2019 28;4(7). pii: 122678. doi: 10.1172/jci.insight.122678

Abstract
Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy causes significant adverse sequelae in the developing fetus, and results in long-term structural and neurologic defects. Most preventive and therapeutic efforts have focused on the development of vaccines, antivirals, and antibodies. The placental immunologic response to ZIKV, however, has been largely overlooked as a target for therapeutic intervention. The placental inflammatory response, specifically IL-1β secretion and signaling, is induced by ZIKV infection and represents an environmental factor that is known to increase the risk of perinatal developmental abnormalities. We show in a mouse model that maternally administrated IL-1 receptor antagonist (IRA; Kineret, or anakinra), following ZIKV exposure, can preserve placental function (by improving trophoblast invasion and placental vasculature), increase fetal viability, and reduce neurobehavioral deficits in the offspring. We further demonstrate that while ZIKV RNA is highly detectable in placentas, it is not correlated with fetal viability. Beyond its effects in the placenta, we show that IL-1 blockade may also directly decrease fetal neuroinflammation by mitigating fetal microglial activation in a dose-dependent manner. Our studies distinguish the role of placental inflammation during ZIKV-infected pregnancies, and demonstrate that maternal IRA may attenuate fetal neuroinflammation and improve perinatal outcomes.

[The use of IRA (Kineret®, or anakinra) in the mouse model looks promising as a treatment that reduces fetal neuroinflammation. One hopes that trials in pregnant monkey will follow. If those trials are successful in attenuating fetal damage, approval of use of IRA in humans may be accelerated since it is a targeted immune modulator that is a FDA approved drug for treatment of several immune-mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. - Mod.TY]
