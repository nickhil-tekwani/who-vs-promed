[1] Qatar, new case - media report, RFI

The Supreme Council of Health [SCH] has confirmed the 1st case of MERS coronavirus for 2014.

A 71-year-old Qatari man with a history of diabetes is receiving treatment in hospital. The diagnosis was confirmed at the national reference laboratory in Doha.

SCH stated that the patient became ill when he was visiting Saudi Arabia. He was travelling by road to Al-Ahsa city and had to be hospitalised after becoming ill. He was then transferred to Qatar by air ambulance and was in quarantine and isolation.

The Rapid Response Team of the SCH conducted an epidemiological investigation including line listing of all close contacts to the case and initiated screening.

Health education about appropriate preventive measures was given to the contacts along with close follow-up for any symptoms.

Infection prevention and control measures in all health facilities have been reinforced by the SCH.

[This is the 1st case reported by Qatar since November 2013. This now makes the 8th case of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infection, including 4 deaths reported by Qatar since 2012. While there is mention that the onset of illness occurred while in Saudi Arabia, from the information available, it is not clear whether the individual was in Saudi Arabia for the entire incubation period, or whether exposure could have occurred in Qatar with onset of illness while travelling to Saudi Arabia.

There have been numerous prior reports of identification of MERS-CoV infection in camels in Qatar (see prior ProMED-mail reports listed below). The media report does not mention whether there is a history of camel exposure in Qatar or in Saudi Arabia. Clearly, more information is necessary before drawing conclusions on the possible exposures of this case.

[With today's (12 Oct 2014) newly reported case, the total of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV identified in Saudi Arabia since June 2012 is now 716, including 324 deaths (case fatality rate 42.6 percent).

The last case (and death) reported in Taif was on 7 Oct 2014 (see MERS-CoV (31): Saudi Arabia, new cases, death 20141007.2840044 for details). This now brings the number of cases confirmed in Taif since the beginning of September 2014 to 9, including 4 deaths (case fatality rate 44.4 percent), representing 47.4 percent of all cases reported in this period (total 19). Of the 9 cases reported in Taif, 3 (33.3 percent) had a history of exposure to animals; 2 (22.2 percent) were in healthcare workers, and the remaining 4 cases (44.4 percent), while their exposures were not stated, all 4 had a history of pre-existing co-morbidities, suggesting they might have had exposure in the healthcare environment either as an inpatient or an outpatient.
