Multispecies mortalities associated with
saxitoxin intoxication due to a toxic algal bloom
of Alexandrium tamarense
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A toxic algal bloom, also known as red tide, some
600 square kilometers [232 square miles] in size,
developed early August [2008] in the St. Lawrence
Estuary (SLE), Quebec, Canada, and resulted in an
unprecedented faunal mortality event in the SLE.
_Alexandrium tamarense_, a toxic dinoflagellate,
naturally present in the SLE and Gulf of St.
Lawrence can bloom when temperature rises and
salinity decreases in surface waters as a result
of increased freshwater runoff in the St.
Lawrence River and coastal tributaries.
_Alexandrium tamarense_ produces saxitoxin that
affects the nervous system of fish, birds, and
mammals and can cause paralytic shellfish
poisoning (PSP) following consumption of
toxin-contaminated organisms.

At the end of July and in early August [2008]
heavy precipitation, warm temperatures and calm
surface waters favored the blooming of the
dinoflagellate at the mouth of the Saquenay
River. On 8 Aug 2008 about 100 dead birds (8
different species) were 1st observed by Parks
Canada staff near Tadoussac at the confluence of
the Saquenay River and St. Lawrence Estuary. As
the bloom drifted towards the south shore of the
St. Lawrence Estuary and moved eastward with the
Gaspe current, numerous dead fish, birds, whales
and seals were observed floating dead or stranded
dead on shore. The bloom dissipated due to strong
winds during the week of 18 Aug 2008 as it
reached the Gulf of St. Lawrence.

During the toxic algal bloom the Canadian
Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) closed
all the shellfish harvesting areas in the
affected zone to protect public health. The
Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) monitors
various shellfish sites in the SLE and advises
closure when levels of toxin in shellfish exceed
the accepted norm. As a precaution the CFIA and
Health Canada advised the public against eating
the liver and viscera of fish and invertebrates
caught in the SLE during the red tide event and
advised against eating the viscera of waterfowl
hunted this fall. Saxitoxin accumulates in the
digestive system of affected organisms but not in
the flesh. Shellfish harvesting sites will open
to the public when monitoring indicates
consumption is safe, some sites have opened
already.

In a joint effort the DFO, Environment Canada,
the CFIA, Parks Canada, the University of
Montreal, the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and
non-governmental organizations such as the Quebec
Emergency Network for Marine Mammals, Group for
Research and Education on Marine Mammals and St.
Lawrence National Institute of Ecotoxicology
collaborated to document mortalities of animals
and collect carcasses or samples for necropsy,
pathologic and toxicologic analyses. Scientific
experts involved in this collaboration have
concluded that this exceptional red tide event
caused the majority of mortalities observed
supporting the initial working hypothesis that
the food chain was contaminanted by saxitoxin
produced by a bloom of _Alexandrium tamarense_.
From 5 Aug to 31 Aug 2008 carcasses of 10 beluga
whales, 8 harbor porpoises and almost 100 grey,
harbor or unidentified seals were reported dead
on the shores of the SLE.

Many carcasses were in an advanced state of
decomposition and, particularly in the case of
seals, many carcasses were likely reported more
than once due to drifting with tides and
currents. The number of seal and beluga
strandings were above average for the month of
August. For example, in the case of the St.
Lawrence Estuary beluga, a threatened population,
the 25-year average number stranded for the month
of August is 2.7. In addition thousands of
fish-eating birds including cormorants, gannets,
kittiwakes, loons, eiders, fulmars, 4 species of
gulls, razorbill, heron, fish such as sand lance,
rainbow smelt, sturgeon, shad, and invertebrates
such as sea cucumbers, crabs and whelks were also
found dead. Aerial surveys by the Canadian Coast
Guard (DFO) and Environment Canada and ground
observations by various observers documented the
distribution of mortalities temporally and
geographically associated with the drift of the
bloom. Neurologically impaired fish and birds,
and some seals and whales with unusual behaviour
were also observed. Pathological analyses to date
have ruled out other possible causes of death for
the majority of carcasses examined which include:
105 birds involving 15 species, 4 fish of 2
different species, 25 grey seals, 4 harbor seals,
3 harbor porpoises and 2 beluga. Most animals
examined at necropsy were in good flesh and
appeared to have died acutely. Additional
analyses are on-going.

Saxitoxin and its derivatives were confirmed in
water samples using high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) at the Institute for Marine
Biosciences, NRC, Halifax and in tissue samples
using ELISA at DFO, Mont-Joli with confirmation
using HPLC. Animals positive for saxitoxin in
their tissues included whelks, sand lance, smelt,
razorbill, grey seal, harbour porpoise and
beluga. Additional samples and analyses are still
in progress and final results will not be known
for several weeks.

Although it is difficult to demonstrate cause of
death due to saxitoxin intoxication
pathologically, the presence of a toxic algal
bloom in the SLE with saxitoxin detected in water
samples, saxitoxin levels higher than the norm in
molluscs, temporally and geographically
associated mortalities of invertebrates, fish,
birds, seals and whales without any other cause
of death identified pathologically and with the
detection of saxitoxin in various tissues from
these animals and some observations of clinical
neurological signs consistent with saxitoxin
intoxication support a conclusion of a
multispecies mortality event due to saxitoxin
produced by a toxic algal bloom of Alexandrium
tamarense in the SLE during the month of August.

[Saxitoxin may be one of the most toxic
non-protein substances known. The LD50 in mice is
approximately 8 microgram/kg which would mean a
lethal dose for a human weighing approximately 70
kg (155 pounds) would be a single dose of 0.2
milligram.

Several algal species are actually
dinoflagellates, including _Alexandrium
tamarense_, _Gymnodinium catenatum_, and
_Pyrodinium bahamense_. Filter-feeding molluscs
ingest the algae and concentrate the toxins which
are produced by the algae.

Saxitoxin can also be synthetically manufactured. Â– Mod.TG]
