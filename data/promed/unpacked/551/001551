The community Secretary of Health, Jorge Vaio, yesterday [23 May 2013] confirmed in Rojas the diagnosis of a hantavirus infection. The official stated that the case was a 27 year old man from Pergamino, who worked and resided in Rojas and is [currently] progressing favorably.

The young man is interned in the San Jose regional hospital in Pergamino. He was 1st attended to in a treatment unit as a precaution awaiting confirmation of the diagnosis and yesterday [23 May 2013] was moved to a shared room.

According to Vaio's explanation to this periodical, the ill individual worked in the dining room of a company situated on provincial route 31, that provides logistical support to the Monsanto of Argentina transport system, specifically to the local plant "Maria Eugenia".

According to Vaio's explanation, the young man arrived at the local hospital ward at the beginning of the week with a "clinical finding of a possible zoonosis". Given this finding, he was sent immediately to the San Jose [Hospital], taking into account that it might have been a case of Argentinian hemorrhagic fever or "mal de los rastrojos", or a hantavirus [infection], that are zoonoses initially with very similar symptomatology.

Finally, Vaio stated, the conslusive diagnosis as a hantavirus [infection] was confirmed by the Instituto Maiztegui, in Junin. The chief of the local health office also pointed out some fundamental aspects [of the case].

1st of all, this was an isolated case. Vaio explained that in Rojas there is a group from the provincial Environmental Health that carried out an inspection of the place where the young man worked, but did not find anything unusual.

2nd, given this Vaio remarked that as a precaution, this locale was closed and fumigated, if that had not already been done by the responsible company. But he stated that there is no other proven case of this same zoonosis.

And 3rd, Vaio especially emphasized that this type of disease "is not transmitted by human contagion, rather by contact with elements where there are rodent droppings, residual excrement or urine. Also, he pointed out that the long-tailed mouse that transmits this hanta[virus] is not infrequent in the district "where 4 years ago we
have had a case," of [a] hantavirus [infection].

Therefore, special emphasis was placed on highlighting the actions being taken practically from the beginning of his term in local government which, through the Office of Food Safety was moving ahead with permanent trash removal campaigns. Precisely [for this reason], on Wednesday [23 May 2013] there was an important meeting in the Monitoring Center to continue defining preventive actions concerning this. Because of this, the Secretary of Health insisted on reminding everyone that "without rodents, there is no infection," stating that the populace must pay attention to the recommendations offered by Food Safety within this context, on the effects of control of local rodent populations.

4th, finally Vaio predicted that, "today the personnel of National Zoonoses will be in Rojas to carry out preventive work in the countryside and carry out tests on live [rodents?].

[This report does not state which hantavirus is responsible for this case. As noted in ProMED-mail archive no 20110430.1348, several hantaviruses have been associated with human infection and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_).

Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved. Andes virus seems unlikely in this case.
