Epidemiological situation of HPAI H5N8 in Europe since October 2016: situation as of 19 Dec 2016
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Data updated on 18 Dec 2016 (inclusive) ADNS/FAO/OIE/DGAL Ministry of Agriculture

Since the previous weekly situation report (12 Dec 2016) [see 20161214.4699227], new highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtype H5N8 outbreaks have been reported in Europe, mainly in Germany (120 cases in birds compared to 98 last week) And Hungary (201 households compared to 120 last week). The United Kingdom declared its 1st outbreak on 17 Dec 2016 in a turkey farm in the Lincolnshire region, presenting a surprisingly very high reported mortality (2408 animals died out of a total of 2428, that is, a mortality rate of 99 percent). Livestock in Serbia are now affected with a 1st outbreak reported on 15 Dec 2016 (species not specified). The total number of outbreaks and cases reported continues to increase and is now 558 (compared to 406 last week), including 292 in wild birds (53 various species affected), 259 in farms and 7 in breeding of captive avifauna [see Tables 1 and 2 at the source URL above].

The HP H5N8 virus is also present beyond Europe. An outbreak of HPAI H5N8 was reported on 13 Nov 2016 in breeding poultry in Israel [see item 2 below]. Cases have also been reported for the 1st time in Egypt on 30 Nov 2016 in 2 coots (_Fulica atra_), Ukraine on 30 Nov 2016 in a livestock (species not identified), and Tunisia on 1 Dec 2016 in 17 coots (_F. atra_) and 13 wigeons (_Anas penelope_). Iran has identified 5 outbreaks in commercial laying hen farms between 14 and 28 Nov 2016. The virus is also circulating in Russia. [In the meantime, Nigeria, Bulgaria, and Ukraine have been infected].

An interactive map of HPAI H5N8 cases and outbreaks in Europe as of 19 Dec 2016 is available at http://shiny-public.anses.fr/note_h5n8/20161219h5n8europe.html. [Green signs stand for poultry, blue for captive birds, red for wild birds; Bulgaria, Ukraine and Russia are not displayed].

Bird flu has now been identified at an egg farm in Friesland, taking the total number of farms affected to 6, the economic affairs ministry confirmed on [Sun 18 Dec 2016].

The 28 500 laying hens on the farm in the village of Hiaure, in the north of the province, will be killed in an effort to prevent the further spread of the disease.

Samples have been taken at another poultry farm within 2 km [1.2 mi] of the affected farm to check for contamination. Junior farm minister Martin van Dam has imposed a 10 km [6.2 mi] ban on the movement of poultry, eggs, and manure around the affected farm, in line with official regulations to combat the spread of the disease.

On [Sun 18 Dec 2016], bird flu was identified at a duck farm in Kamperveen. All 14 000 ducks on the farm are being destroyed. Earlier, officials identified the virus in several wild ducks near Kamperveen, which is in Overijssel province.

The H5 virus was first identified in a number of dead wild ducks in November [2016] and was then confirmed at several duck farms in Biddinghuizen, in the heart of Flevoland. Over 200 000 ducks and nearly 100 000 hens have so far been killed in an effort to stem the spread of the disease.

All poultry farmers, zoos and private owners have been ordered to keep their birds indoors because of the risk of spreading the disease. Officials have also introduced a ban on bird shows and on hunting ducks and geese.

The H5N8 variant of bird flu can be transmitted to people in rare cases. They will experience light flu-like symptoms, the public health institute RIVM said.

The last outbreak of bird flu in the Netherlands was in 2014 but that was restricted to a handful of farms. The 2003 avian flu outbreak cost the Dutch poultry and egg industry at least 300m Euro [about USD 312m] in direct costs at that time.

According to the Israeli Veterinary Services (Dr Avishai Lublin, Head of Poultry diseases Division in the Kimron Veterinary Institute), the following results have been obtained from wild birds:

On 6 Dec 2016, 80 different wild birds were found dead near Faran (southern Israel) in an oxidation pond. 60 cadavers were collected and transferred for further testing to the Veterinary Kimron Institute. The majority were mallard ducks and they were found positive for HPAI H5N8.

In addition, on 12 Dec 2012, a gray goose was found sick near Kfar Menachem, and later died. The goose was also tested by the poultry lab and found H5N8 positive. Wild birds (_Plegadis falcinellus_ and _Bubulcus ibis_), were found dead at Beer Tuvia industrial zone on 12 Dec 2016. The birds were H5 positive by PCR.

[This is the 1st piece of information on HPAI H5N8 identified in wild birds in Israel, a Middle Eastern country located within the Eastern Mediterranean Flyway, regarded the 2nd largest bird migration corridor in the world.

In the meantime, the virus continues its spread; from an unofficial reliable source we are told that a new outbreak has been identified today (20 Dec 2016) in a commercial turkey flock in Mayan-Zvi, situated close to a fish-farming area extensively visited by migrating water birds (see map at http://tinyurl.com/z6zjnd6). Israel's last follow-up report was submitted on 13 Dec 2016; the reports and a map showing the locations of the 4 outbreaks as of 13 Dec 2016, are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=21531. - Mod.AS]

More than 4000 ducks were culled in Bulgaria over the past few days after bird flu was found on 3 farms, the Bulgarian food safety agency said on [Mon 19 Dec 2016].

Some 3150 of the ducks were from a farm in the southern village of Manole, another 900 ducks were from a farm in the northwestern town of Vratsa and several dozen of birds were from the village of Novo Selo on the river Danube.

"They were killed after a virulent bird flu was discovered," Martin Radev, the agency spokesman said. "Most probably, it is H5N8 but I am still not able to confirm this because the laboratory tests are still under way."

A series of European countries and Israel have found cases of H5N8 bird flu in the past few weeks and some ordered poultry flocks be kept indoors to prevent the disease spreading.

The Bulgarian authorities have introduced tougher sanitary rules to prevent infection, including a nationwide ban on poultry markets. Hunting of game birds has also been prohibited.

Montenegro reported its 1st case of bird flu on [Tue 20 Dec 2016] after a dead duck was found infected with the H5N8 strain of the illness on Lake Skadar in the east of the country, state television reported.

Cases of bird flu have been found in a number of countries across Europe, including in neighbouring Serbia and Croatia, as well as in Asia over the past month.

Montenegro's food safety agency said there was no risk for humans but recommended that farmers keep their chickens indoors and take all preventive measures, the television reported.

Montenegro has already banned imports of poultry from countries where bird flu had been diagnosed. Last month [November 2016], Croatia said that 10 dead swans had been found infected with bird flu in the east of the country.

[Several highly pathogenic (HP) and low pathogenic (LP) avian influenza (AI) serotypes and clades are actively circulating around the world, in some cases contemporarily in the same geographical area. 2 waves of incursions linked to wild bird migration have been detected recently:

- an H5N8 HPAI strain detected for the 1st time in Southern Russia in June 2016, currently spreading globally following wild birds' migratory routes. So far it was detected in 23 countries in Asia, Europe, and Africa. This strain is highly infectious while demonstrating its high pathogenicity in both wild and domestic birds. So far, it has not been found involved in clinical human disease.

- an H5N6 HPAI has been detected for the 1st time in South Korea and Japan since late-October 2016. This strain has infected in-contact humans but, according to the WHO risk assessment, it is considered to pose a relatively low risk for human to human transmission. However, every human case is an opportunity for the avian viruses to evolve and potentially adapt to humans.

Co-circulation and multiple infections of avian influenza viruses in poultry or wild birds provide the opportunity for recombination of AI viruses of different origins.

The HPAI H5N8 is continuing its intensive circulation in Europe, spreading south-eastwards. In addition to Bulgaria and Montenegro, an outbreak which started in Ukraine on 14 Nov 2016 in a backyard holding in the south (Kherson) was notified to the OIE as H5. This was followed by 2 additional outbreaks on backyards and one wild bird (mute swan: _Cygnus olor_). See all 3 reports and an interactive map showing the locations of the 4 outbreaks at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=21731. We are told that the Ukrainian outbreak has been confirmed to be caused by HPAI H5N8. - Mod.AS]
