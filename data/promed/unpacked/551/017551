Classical swine fever, Israel
-----------------------------
The following sentence has been added to the original epidemiological comments:

"After verification, it is not the 1st time that classical swine
fever [CSF] is reported in Israel. The date of the previous
occurrence of this disease in Israel is 1948."

[In fact, CSF has not been recorded within the boundaries of the
State of Israel since its establishment (declaration of independence)
namely since 14 May 1948. The disease had been reported by the
Veterinary Service of the Department of Agriculture and Forests,
(British Mandatory) Palestine, prior to 1948.

We are informed from a reliable source, that the OIE Reference
Laboratory for CSF, Institute of Virology, Hannover Veterinary
School, Germany has confirmed by PCR, in the meantime, the Israeli
diagnosis. Culling of infected animals and vaccination (with a
European vaccine) around the outbreak are being undertaken.

Information on the CSF situation in neighbouring Lebanon, in domestic
as well as wild porcines, is anticipated with interest and concern. - Mod.AS]
