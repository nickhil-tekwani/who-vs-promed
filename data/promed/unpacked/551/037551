A highly pathogenic strain of avian flu has been confirmed in New Hampshire. Fish and Game Department officials said 20 wild mallards have tested positive in Rockingham County.

State veterinarian Steve Crawford said the avian flu has not been detected in any domestic birds, but he said farms and bird owners should take steps to protect their flocks.

"This kills a lot of domestic birds when it infects them," Crawford said. "Our recommendation to domestic bird owners are to keep your birds away, fully separated from wild waterfowl, from their feces, from their dander."

The state Department of Agriculture said it is ramping up testing.

Officials said the strain of avian flu is unlikely to affect humans.

A highly pathogenic avian influenza has been detected in wild ducks in Connecticut during routine surveillance, according to officials.

The state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) said its biologists and United States Department of Agriculture staff detected the presence of the bird flu in mallards and continue to monitor the situation.

The routine wild bird surveillance program helps serve as the state's early-warning system, reducing the risks of spread to poultry producers, DEEP said.

DEEP said wild bird can be infected with the virus and show no signs of illness. As they migrate, they can then spread the disease to new areas.

A backyard flock of pet chickens in New York's Suffolk County were detected with the flu on 19 Feb [2022]. Following that discovery, some health experts in Connecticut expressed concerns with the strain being found so close to the state.

In the past 5 years, low pathogenic avian influenza has been found in Connecticut 3 times, according to the state Department of Agriculture website.

The state agency urged any residents who own chicken or other game birds to be aware of the situation and report anything out of the ordinary, DEEP said. Among the signs of avian flu are depression, decreased food and water consumption, decreased egg production, soft or misshapen eggs, and any respiratory signs like coughing or sneezing.

Anyone who suspects poultry might have died from unknown causes is asked to contact the state veterinarian at 860-713-2505 or <ctstate.vet@ct.gov>.

Avian influenza has been detected in a 6th commercial poultry flock in southern Indiana, state officials said Tuesday [1 Mar 2022].

Laboratory testing of a 4th commercial turkey flock in Dubois County has come back as presumptively positive for the virus, the Indiana State Board of Animal Health (BOAH) said. The samples are being verified at the US Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Iowa.

Three previous cases were found in Dubois County and 2 in Greene County. Cases have also been detected in Michigan, in a backyard flock and in a zoo.

Pending test results should indicate if it is the same strain of the virus having been found elsewhere and if it is highly pathogenic.

Officials have begun euthanizing the 16 500 birds at the latest farm to prevent the spread of the disease.

Animal Health Board staff have reached out to known hobby/backyard poultry owners in the area to schedule testing of birds there, it said.

The agency said avian influenza does not present an immediate public health concern and no human cases of avian influenza viruses have been detected in the US.

The turkey infections are the 1st confirmation of highly pathogenic bird flu in commercial poultry in the US since 2020, the US Department of Agriculture has said.

A January 2016 outbreak of bird flu in Dubois County affected 11 poultry farms, resulting in the loss of more than 400 000 birds, the Animal Health Board said.

Indiana ranks 3rd nationally in turkey production.

[4] Florida (multiple counties): wild birds

As of 28 Feb [2022], highly pathogenic avian influenza has arrived in Florida via wild waterfowl returning from nesting in the arctic where they comingled with birds from around the world.

Confirmed cases in wild waterfowl have been reported in Volusia, Brevard, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Palm Beach Counties.

The remainder of the state is under surveillance.

According to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, the United States Department of Agriculture, and the Florida Department of Health, as of this writing, no cases of this bird flu have been found in the domestic, backyard, or commercial birds in Florida.

Wild birds, particularly water birds, can carry many strains of low pathogenic avian influenza, most of which do not cause disease in domestic poultry. However, when a low pathogenic strain undergoes a mutation and forms a highly pathogenic strain, the mutated strain can cause significant disease in domestic poultry.

The HPAI virus is not easily transmissible from birds to humans, but health officials are concerned it could mutate into another form capable of spreading readily from person to person, triggering a pandemic.

No cases of human infections with HPAI have been reported in the United States as of this writing. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) considers the current risk to the public to be low.

As risk depends on exposure, it is best to not touch sick or dead wild birds. If such instances are necessary, persons handling such wild birds should use personal protective equipment such as protective clothing, rubber boots, gloves, eye protection, and face shields.

After handling the bird, these items can be disinfected with a 10% bleach water solution. Report wild bird mortalities to http://app.myfwc.com/FWRI/AvianMortality/.

To keep domestic, backyard, and commercial flocks free of this virus, it is recommended all poultry (chickens, ducks, turkeys, geese, etc.) be housed inside a coop with a solid roof and steps be taken to prevent wild birds from entering the coop.

It is also recommended to limit visits to your coop to only those who regularly handle your poultry. Report sick or dead birds to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) or your veterinarian.

To help in the tracking of HPAI,
- report sick or dead commercial or backyard birds to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (<FDACS.gov>) or your veterinarian;
- report wild bird mortalities to http://app.myfwc.com/FWRI/AvianMortality/.

[5] Iowa (Pottawattamie County): non-commercial poultry

The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) on Wednesday [2 Mar 2022] confirmed a positive case of highly pathogenic bird flu in Pottawattamie County.

"This is certainly not welcomed news, but it's not unexpected," says Mike Naig, Secretary of Agriculture. The Iowa Department of Agriculture reports the virus was found in a non-commercial, backyard flock of 42 chickens and ducks.

"After the notification of any high-path avian influenza case, we always immediately quarantine," says Dr. Jeff Kaisand, the state veterinarian. "The flock in question was put in quarantine. All birds at the positive site have been depopulated, and disposal has occurred."

The recent bird flu detections in birds do not present an immediate public health concern for humans, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

"We recognize the threat HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) and other foreign animal diseases pose to Iowa agriculture," Secretary Mike Naig said in a news release. "We have been working with USDA, livestock producers, and other stakeholders to develop, test, and strengthen our foreign animal disease preparedness and response plans since the 2015 HPAI outbreak. While a case like this is not unexpected, we are working with USDA and other partners to implement our plans and protect the health of poultry flocks in Iowa."

Bird flu is often fatal for birds, and the warmer temperatures pose an increased threat of more positive cases in the state.

"The virus does appear to be very prevalent in wild birds, so the next few months during the time of northern migration and the Mississippi fly away will be a time of high alert for all poultry owners," said Naig.

The agriculture department said biosecurity resources and best practices are available at
http://www.iowaagriculture.gov/biosecurity.

Signs of HPAI include the following:
- sudden increase in bird deaths without any clinical signs
- lack of energy and appetite
- decrease in egg production
- soft- or thin-shelled or misshapen eggs
- swelling of the head, eyelids, comb, wattles, and hocks
- purple discoloration of the wattles, comb, and legs
- gasping for air (difficulty breathing)
- coughing, sneezing, and/or nasal discharge (runny nose)
- stumbling or falling down
- diarrhea

[Avian influenza continues to move across the United States. Everyone must be diligent about biosecurity of the birds. Be on the alert for ill birds in your flock, and if you are a hunter, take notice if there are ill birds in flocks you may be hunting. If you are able, bring your birds inside. They can be in your garage or something like a back room. Even in winter, birds will need some type of ventilation, so a fan may be needed, but, of course, severe cold is always an issue as well. The point is to do what is necessary to protect your birds.

Migrating birds can transport the virus without the migratory bird appearing to be ill. So this is a time to be very vigilant about all birds near your flock. - Mod.TG]
