Mystery illness plagues school
------------------------------
Graham Templin, 6, woke up Wednesday [25 Apr
2007] feeling ill. When Graham vomited before
heading to school, his parents decided to keep
him home for the day. Graham was just one of more
than 100 Saegertown Elementary School students
absent from school on Wednesday after
experiencing flu-like [better expressed as
gastroenteritis-like - Mod.CP] symptoms. An
additional 11 students were sent home after
getting sick during school. All told,
approximately 20 percent of the school's 642
students were absent.
Although the cause of sickness has yet to be
determined, the Pennsylvania Department of Health
said a gastrointestinal virus may be to blame.
Students experienced symptoms that included
vomiting, abdominal pain and low fever, according
to Richard McGarvey, director of communications
for the Pennsylvania Department of Health.
Samples of some of the students' vomit was
collected by the department and will be tested to
determine a cause; however, it may be a few days
before results are known, he added. No students
were hospitalized, McGarvey said, and there was
no quarantine of the school.
"There are a number (of viruses) that can be
transmitted from person to person," McGarvey
said. "It �a little late in the season, but it
�not too far outside the normal period for
viruses."
A letter from the school was sent home to the
children's parents informing them of the
situation and encouraging students to practice
good hygiene. The note also urged parents to keep
their children at home if they're experiencing
these symptoms, said Graham Templin's dad, Chad,
who is vice president of the Penncrest School
board. Chad Templin said that 119 students were
absent at the start of the school day, while 11
additional students were sent home with the
symptoms. He added that his 3-year-old son, a
pre-schooler at Meadville Cooperative, was sick
with similar symptoms last Saturday [21 Apr
2007], but improved within 24 hours.
Penncrest Superintendent Richard Borchilo said
that while the number of sick students was not a
record, the total was higher than usual.
Typically, he said, an average of 19 to 25
students are sick each day at the elementary
school. Borchilo added that there was also "a
slight rise in absenteeism in some other
schools," including Maplewood Elementary School.
Borchilo said that health precautions are taken
on regular basis to keep the schools clean. He
added that the food served in the cafeteria has
also been checked. "We'll be monitoring the
(Saegertown Elementary School's) attendance for
the next few days," he said.

[This "mystery illness" affecting pupils at one
or more one elementary schools in Saegertown
[north-western Pennsylvania] has the
characteristics of an outbreak of sudden-onset
short duration gastroenteritis caused by a
norovirus. Norovirus outbreaks can occur in
institutional settings, such as schools,
childcare facilities, and nursing homes, and can
occur in other group settings, such as banquet
halls, cruise ships, dormitories, and campgrounds.
Viral gastroenteritis occurs in people of all
ages and backgrounds. However, some viruses tend
to cause diarrheal disease primarily among people
in specific age groups. Rotavirus and norovirus
infections are the most common cause of diarrhea
in infants and young children under 5 years old.
Adenoviruses and astroviruses cause diarrhea
mostly in young children, but older children and
adults can also be affected. Noroviruses are more
likely to cause diarrhea in older children and
adults.
Noroviruses are named after the original strain
"Norwalk virus," which caused an outbreak of
gastroenteritis in a school in Norwalk, Ohio, in
1968. Currently, there are at least 5 norovirus
genogroups (GI, GII, GIII, GIV and GV), which in
turn are divided into at least 31 genetic
clusters. The incubation period for
norovirus-associated gastroenteritis in humans is
usually between 24 and 48 hours (median in
outbreaks 33 to 36 hours), but cases can occur
within 12 hours of exposure. Norovirus infection
usually presents as acute-onset vomiting, watery
non-bloody diarrhea with abdominal cramps, and
nausea. Low-grade fever also occasionally occurs,
and vomiting is more common in children. The
illness associated with norovirus infection in
the past was designated "winter-vomiting
disease." Dehydration is the most common
complication, especially among the young and
elderly, and may require medical attention.
Symptoms usually last 24 to 60 hours. Recovery is
usually complete and there is no evidence of any
serious long-term sequelae.
Noroviruses are transmitted primarily through the
fecal-oral route, either by consumption of
fecally contaminated food or water or by direct
person-to-person spread. Environmental and fomite
contamination may also act as a source of
infection. Good evidence exists for transmission
due to aerosolization of vomit that presumably
results in droplets contaminating surfaces or
entering the oral mucosa and being swallowed.
Noroviruses are highly contagious and it has been
estimated that as few as 10 viral particles may
be sufficient to infect an individual. During
outbreaks of norovirus gastroenteritis, several
modes of transmission have been documented;
including both food-borne and person-to-person
transmission according to circumstance.
Confirmation of this presumptive diagnosis by
laboratory testing has still to be obtained. -
