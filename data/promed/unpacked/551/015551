Convention in Chicago-area hotel disrupted by chlorine gas outbreak
----------------------------------------------------------------------
On Saturday night [6 Dec 2014], 19 people wound up in the hospital in the suburbs of Chicago after they were sickened by exposure to chlorine gas in an apparently deliberate attack during the 2014 Midwest FurFest convention at the Hyatt Regency O'Hare hotel. Several thousand people were evacuated from the hotel in the early morning hours, according to the Chicago Tribune.

Many of the affected hotel guests had checked in for the annual convention, also referred to as "Anthrocon," in which participants dress up and socialize in animal costumes. The Associated Press brought word about the suspicious chemically fueled interruption later that morning (via The Salt Lake Tribune):

A total of 19 people who became nauseous or dizzy were treated at local hospitals, and at least 18 were released shortly thereafter.

The source of the gas was apparently chlorine powder left in a 9th-floor stairwell at the Hyatt Regency O'Hare, according to the Rosemont Public Safety Department. Investigators believe the gas was created intentionally and are treating it as a criminal matter.

[...] Guests were allowed to return a few hours later after the hotel had been decontaminated, and by mid-morning the "furries" were pouring back into the hotel for more activities, chat with each other, and make their way to a outdoor courtyard where they took part in a group exercise session, with foxes, dragons, and other characters getting an aerobic workout.

Other costumed guests who did not need immediate medical attention were shepherded into a dog show across the street from the hotel, the AP also reported.

[Chlorine powder left in a 9th-floor stairwell causes evacuation of the entire hotel? So just how much powdered chlorine was there? How long had it been there? To evacuate the whole hotel there must have been a substantial amount of it. Neither this article, nor the Chicago Tribune tell us the amount of powder that was found on the 9th floor. While powder may have an odor it is not likely to cause the kind of fumes needed to evacuate the hotel. Now, if water were added to the powder to produce a solution, then fumes would be more likely. The title of the article mentions chlorine gas but gas from a powdered source is far less likely than from the addition of some liquid to that powder. Additional information from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated.

Chlorine gas is a pulmonary irritant with intermediate water solubility that causes acute damage in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Occupational exposures constitute the highest risk for serious toxicity from high-concentration chlorine. Mixing of chlorine bleach (sodium hypochlorite) with ammonia or acidic cleaning agents is a common source of household exposure. As with all poisons, the dose determines the toxicity. Exposure to low concentrations of chlorine for prolonged periods may have destructive effects, as might very short-term exposure to high concentrations.

Symptoms may vary depending on the degree of exposure. Exposure possibilities include acute low levels, acute high levels, and chronic low levels.

Low-level (3-5 percent, 1-15 ppm) acute exposure:
Most poisonings fall into this category and are caused by household exposure to low-concentration cleaning products. Manifestations are as follows:
- Eye tearing, nose and throat irritation
- Sneezing
- Excess salivation
- General excitement or restlessness

High-level (20 percent, greater than 30 ppm) acute exposure:
In addition to the symptoms seen with low-level exposure, high-level exposure may result in the following:
- Dyspnea: Upper airway swelling and obstruction may occur
- Violent cough
- Nausea and vomiting (with the smell of chlorine in emesis)
- Lightheadedness
- Headache
- Chest pain or retrosternal burning
- Muscle weakness
- Abdominal discomfort
- Dermatitis (with liquid exposure): Corneal burns and ulcerations may occur from splash exposure to high-concentration chlorine products
- Esophageal perforation
