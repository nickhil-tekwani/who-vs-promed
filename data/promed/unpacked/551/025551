Wheat streak mosaic virus [WSMV] has been detected for the 1st time in
Argentina in wheat crops (_Triticum aestivum_) growing in the central area
of the country (Cordoba province). Virus identity was established by host
range experiments, electron microscopy, serology, and polymerase chain
reaction (PCR).

[Unless I am mistaken, this report may be the 1st report of WSMV in South
America. The virus is a member of the genus _Tritimovirus_, family
_Potyviridae_, and is transmitted by the eriophyid mite _Acer tosichella_.
Characteristic WSMV particles (700 x 15 nm) were observed in electron
micrographs from infected wheat and confirmed by serological tests.
Damage to wheat crops can range from complete crop failure to severe
reduction in yield. The outbreak in Argentina was observed in cvs. ACA 223,
Baguette and Buck Guapo in wheat fields in Cordoba province. WSMV has been
reported from Canada, China, Czech Republic, Hungary, Iran, Jordan, Mexico,
Poland, Rumania, Russia, Turkey, Ukraine, USA, the former Yugoslavia and Syria.
In North America, conditions favoring spread of the disease are the
presence of a source of infection coupled with early planting of winter
wheat. Severe losses can occur in early planted fields of winter wheat and
spring wheat. _A. tosichella_ needs living plants to survive year-round.
Nymphal mites can acquire the virus after feeding for 15 minutes or more on
infected plants, and they remain viruliferous for several days in the
absence of infected plants.
High sequence identity of US and Turkish WSMV genotypes suggests that
humans assisted the movement of WSMV across the Atlantic. Immigrants from
the Crimea initiated the hard red winter culture in South Dakota, Nebraska,
and Kansas in the 1880s, and germplasm exchange was frequent between the
Great Plains of North America and the Black Sea. WSMV is reportedly
seedborne at low rates (0.1-0.2 per cent) in maize and wheat, and both the
virus and its vector could have been transported across the Atlantic in
grain shipments.
Disease management depends upon eliminating or destroying volunteer wheat
and susceptible weeds before the new crop is sown.
