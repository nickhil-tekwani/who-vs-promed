A public elementary school in Tubungan town, Iloilo has recorded a total of 36 chickenpox cases from 15 Jan to 3 Mar [2019], the Provincial Health Office (PHO) said. In an interview on Wednesday [20 Mar 2019], Dr. Patricia Grace Trabado, PHO head, said the cases were observed as patients who sought treatment at the rural health units (RHU) and private clinics in Tubungan.

All the cases were recorded in Cadabdab Elementary School, with 21 male and 15 female students affected. Trabado said affected pupils might still be attending school even though they were infected, which resulted in its transmission.

She emphasized that the spread of the infection might have been prevented if the children were advised not to attend school with the onset of infection. "If a child is showing chickenpox symptoms, especially when he or she was previously exposed to an affected person, then the pupil will be advised to stay at home," she said.

Trabado said the source of the infection came from the 1st patient working in Iloilo City but lives in Tubungan town. "The patient might have a family member that attends school in Cadabdab. From there, we see where the infection originated," she said. Trabado, however, did not give figures of the disease other than that from the school.

The RHUs and private clinics were able to monitor and manage the cases, Trabado said. All the student patients were discharged, given medication, and let the viral infection take its course. "And eventually, the patients recovered," she said. However, Trabado warns that a child with chickenpox can get secondary infection when he or she scratches the blisters, creating skin lesions.

She added that cases of chickenpox and mumps are mostly observed during the summer season. Trabado said patients with chickenpox experience fever and headache in the first 1 or 2 days before the itchy blister rash appears.

Health officials at a prison in southern New Mexico are working to stop the spread of chickenpox. Some inmates at the Otero County prison have been placed in quarantine. The prison said one inmate was diagnosed with chickenpox and staff acted quickly as a precaution.

As of Thursday [21 Mar 2019] , there is only one confirmed case. Just off Highway 54 in New Mexico, you can see some inmates out enjoying a sunny spring day. What you don't see is others in isolation who may have been exposed to chickenpox.

Chantel Virammontes lives just up the street from the prison. "I've seen things go and come out here in Chaparral," said Virammontes. "Probably about a mile. Sounds very extreme, it's scary."

Jeff Gore agrees but says he's glad the prison is doing what it feels is needed. "Well, if it's necessary from keeping it from getting spread, it's the right thing to do," said Gore.

Gore told CBS4 he knows various people throughout the Chapparal community who work in the prison. "It still could possibly get spread to one of the guards, and one of the guards could spread it to the community," said Gore.

The prison said it has several housing units quarantined but didn't say how many or the number of prisoners that includes. The prison said visitors are still allowed on the weekends. Some of those inmates have been isolated for 11 days now.

[The close and constrained environment of prison can be quite conducive to rapid spread of infectious diseases such as chickenpox to various sections of the facility as well as to the community. Isolation of confirmed cases during the infectious period can help contain the spread, and post-exposure vaccination should be considered in such settings. - Mod.UBA
