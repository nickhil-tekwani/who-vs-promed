RABID BAT ATTACKS CAT IN NORG
A bat with rabies has been observed in a summerhouse in Norg, a community
in the province of Drenthe.
The owner of the house was met by a strange sight when he returned to his
vacation home and found his cat fighting with a bat. The bat acted as if
it was crazy and carried out repeated aerial attacks upon the cat. It is
not clear how the bat got into the house.
Finally the bat was caught by policemen, who had been summoned. After an
examination by the veterinary service in Leeuwarden, it was concluded that
the aggressive bat suffered from rabies.
Because the cat had been in contact with the bat [the owner] was advised to
inoculate the cat against rabies. Neither the police, nor the local health
service in Drenthe had received any further messages about rabid bats.
