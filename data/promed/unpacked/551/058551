More than 1000 migratory birds have been found dead from the H5N1
strain of avian flu in China, far higher than previously
acknowledged, Chinese officials said.

"Up to 26 May 2005, total of over 1000 birds have been found dead,"
Jia Youling, director of the Ministry of Agriculture's veterinary
bureau, said at a press conference.

China had previously admitted only 178 birds died from an outbreak of
bird flu at a nature reserve in the western province of Qinghai. The
dead birds include wild geese, gulls and cormorants [and wild ducks, see
ref. to geese (02) below. - Mod.jw] .

A report sent by the bureau to the World Organization for Animal
Health, seen by AFP, said the estimated date of primary infection of
the birds was 15 Apr 2005 at Lake Qinghai, the nation's largest
saltwater lake. The site, an important rendezvous of migratory
birds on one of their Asia-Europe routes, is a major tourist
attraction.

Tests confirming an outbreak of bird flu were carried out on 18 May
2005, with the ministry making the information public 3 days later,
the report showed. Since then China has been conducting a massive
containment effort, scrambling to vaccinate 3 million birds in the
province.

It is the 1st confirmed outbreak in China in nearly a year from the
H5N1 virus, which is potentially lethal to humans.

On Thursday [26 May 2005], China's Ministry of Health said that no
cases of human infection had been detected.

Chinese scientists meanwhile have announced 2 new vaccines have been
developed to effectively curb the spread of H5N1 to fowl, water birds
and mammals.

[The conflicting numbers in different announcements illuminate the
need for clarification. An avian influenza virus which will kill such
numbers of wild birds belonging to different species and within a
short time frame is exceptional. Let us wait for official details in
China's expected notification to the OIE, particularly the number of
tested birds of each species, pathological changes observed,
diagnostic techniques applied and exclusion of other potential
causative agents. - Mod.AS]
