Q FEVER - AUSTRALIA (SOUTH AUSTRALIA) (03): FATALITY

The South Australian Health Department has confirmed that an elderly
woman has died after contracting Q fever in the Riverland town of
Waikerie. The outbreak has been linked to a goat abattoir and has
affected 5 people who lived nearby.
The disease is carried by animals and can cause flu-like symptoms in
people. The abattoir stopped operations last month [June 2007] after
the council asked the owners to comply with a 1997 approval allowing
only the slaughter of emus and ostriches. But the abattoir operator
says it is expecting to resume operations today [30 Jul 2007] after
legal advice from the owners.
It is understood that the 76-year-old woman who has died had an
underlying medical condition.
Dr Ann Koehler from the Health Department thinks any risk of further
cases has passed. "We believe the risk from the exposure that caused
the outbreak is over, because it's past 60 days incubation period,"
she said. "So we don't expect any more people to get sick from that."

[It is not clear whether this fatality is directly attributed to Q
fever. Most deaths from this infection are related to chronic
infection, often endocarditis.
The following is adapted and was obtained from "Up-To-Date"
<http://www.uptodateonline.com.newproxy.downstate.edu/utd/content/topic.do?topicKey=endocard/9987&selectedTitle=2~31&source=search_result>:
"Q fever endocarditis is a severe and often fatal disease that is the
major manifestation of chronic Q fever. In a large retrospective
study of patients seen between 1985 and 1998, 23 percent had chronic
Q fever, and endocarditis was the predominant manifestation in 77
percent of these patients.
Most patients with Q fever endocarditis are men over the age of 40,
but women and children also develop this complication. An exposure
factor such as professional contact with cattle is frequently found,
but uncertainty about the incubation time and the usually long delay
in diagnosis can mask important exposures.
Most patients with Q fever endocarditis have preexisting valve
disease (93 percent in a series of 102 patients). The underlying
heart disease may be congenital, rheumatic, degenerative, or
syphilitic. The aortic and mitral valves are often involved, but 55
percent of patients in one report had prosthetic valve endocarditis."
If further cases occur related to this cluster, it may be due to the
relative stability of the infectious form of _Coxiella burnetii_. The
organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common
disinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long
periods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is
associated with compact small cell variants of the organism that are
produced during standard replication along with the less resistant
large cell form, metabolically dormant, and spore-like.
Infection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms
from air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried
placental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd
animals. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very
few organisms may be required to cause infection. - Mod.LL]
