WHO says monkeypox containable, but nations should be on alert.
----------------------------------------------------------------
More than 20 countries have logged a combined total of more than 300 monkeypox cases, a development that a World Health Organization (WHO) official deemed "unusual."

"We normally have only a handful of cases exported to non-endemic countries," said Sylvie Briand, MD, PhD, MPH, the WHO director for Global Infectious Hazard Preparedness, during a press briefing in Geneva today. "We have unknowns about origin of sudden outbreaks in non-endemic countries."

Briand said WHO investigators do not believe the virus has changed substantially from the endemic clade seen in West Africa. Instead, she said a change in human behavior was probably at play.

"This is not a disease the public should be worried about; this is not COVID," Briand said, before explaining the WHO believes partner countries will be able to contain the spread of monkeypox through rigorous contact tracing.

"We must make sure we all know the risk in front of us." she said.

Mass General staff to be administered Jynneos
---------------------------------------------
Massachusetts General Hospital became the 1st facility in the United States to vaccinate health workers exposed to monkeypox (outside of clinical trials) with Jynneos, Bavarian Nordic's monkeypox vaccine.

Fewer than 10 healthcare workers deemed high or moderate risk for contracting monkeypox received the vaccine. Last week, Massachusetts confirmed the 1st case of monkeypox in the United States in the current outbreak, in a man who had recently traveled to Canada.

The vaccine requires 2 doses, administered 4 weeks apart.

Today [27 May 2022] Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report published recommendations on the use of Jynneos as preexposure protection for those exposed to orthopoxviruses at work, including booster doses.

"Persons who received the 2-dose Jynneos primary series and who are at ongoing risk for occupational exposure to more virulent orthopoxvirus e.g., Variola virus and Monkeypox virus, should receive a booster dose of Jynneos every 2 years after the primary Jynneos series," they wrote.

More cases detected in UK
-------------------------
Today [27 May 2022] the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said it has detected 16 additional cases of monkeypox in England, bringing the UK total to 106. The 1st case was detected on [7 May 2022].

Spain has an additional 25 cases, bringing the national total to 84. Another 73 cases are suspected. Neighboring Portugal has confirmed 58 cases. Most cases are in men who have sex with men.

In Canada, there are now 26 confirmed cases (25 in Quebec, 1 in Ontario).

[A 28 May 2022 report cites a local epidemiologist who is urging for aggressive action to address the monkeypox virus outbreak, which has infected more than 400 people worldwide. Dr. Michael Mina, a former Brigham and Women's epidemiologist and Chief Science Officer of eMed, warned Friday [27 May 2022] against a "wait and see" approach when it comes to monkeypox. "If we wait and see ... then by the time we are seeing, it's too late," Mina said on Twitter.

Use of JYNNEOS (Smallpox and Monkeypox Vaccine, Live, Nonreplicating) for Preexposure Vaccination of Persons at Risk for Occupational Exposure to Orthopoxviruses: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices -- United States, 2022.

Summary
-------
What is already known about this topic?
In 2015, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended preexposure prophylaxis with ACAM2000, a replication-competent live virus _Vaccinia_ virus vaccine, for certain U.S. persons at risk for occupational exposure to orthopoxviruses.

What is added by this report?
In 2019, JYNNEOS, a replication-deficient live _Vaccinia_ virus vaccine was licensed in the United States. On 3 Nov 2021, ACIP voted to recommend JYNNEOS preexposure prophylaxis as an alternative to ACAM2000 for certain persons at risk for exposure to orthopoxviruses.

What are the implications for public health practice?
A 2nd vaccine is now available for persons for whom vaccination against orthopoxvirus infections is recommended. Potential vaccinees should weigh the risks and benefits of each vaccine when deciding which to receive.

Recommendations
Research laboratory personnel, clinical laboratory personnel performing diagnostic testing for orthopoxviruses, designated response team members and health care personnel who administer ACAM2000 (Smallpox [Vaccinia] Vaccine, Live) or care for patients infected with orthopoxviruses are the persons to whom these recommendations apply (Table 1). For laboratory personnel and designated response team members, ACIP recommends use of JYNNEOS for primary vaccination as an alternative to ACAM2000. For health care personnel who administer ACAM2000 or care for patients infected with orthopoxviruses, ACIP recommends use of JYNNEOS (as an alternative to ACAM2000), based on shared clinical decision-making. In addition, persons who received the 2-dose JYNNEOS primary series and who are at ongoing risk for occupational exposure to more virulent orthopoxvirus (e.g., Variola virus and Monkeypox virus), should receive a booster dose of JYNNEOS every 2 years after the primary JYNNEOS series; persons who receive the 2-dose JYNNEOS primary series and who are at ongoing risk for occupational exposure to less virulent orthopoxviruses, (e.g., Vaccinia virus or Cowpox virus), should receive booster doses of JYNNEOS at least every 10 years after the primary JYNNEOS series. ACIP also recommends that persons who received an ACAM2000 primary vaccination and who are at ongoing risk for occupational exposure to orthopoxviruses may receive a booster dose of JYNNEOS as an alternative to a booster dose of ACAM2000.

[4] A question of vaccine viability, request for information
Date: Sat 28 May 2022
Source: Bangkok Post [edited]
https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2317190/old-frozen-vax-to-be-tested-on-monkeypox


The Thai Department of Medical Sciences (DMSC) plans to test a freeze-dried version of a live attenuated smallpox vaccine that has been stored in Thailand for more than 4 decades, to see if it can effectively combat monkeypox.

Supakit Sirilak, director-general of the DMSC, said on Friday [27 May 2022] the vaccine material has been kept under the supervision of the Government Pharmaceutical Organisation (GPO) since smallpox was eradicated in 1980.

A sample has been sent to the DMSC to ensure it is uncontaminated and still usable, Dr Supakit said.

There are reportedly around 10 000 doses of smallpox vaccine being kept in Thailand.

"As soon as an infection is reported in the country, the department will culture the virus using blood from a recipient of the smallpox vaccine in 1980 in order to build immunity and see if it can safeguard people from monkeypox," he said.

Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul confirmed the DMSC would perform the virus culture for analysis.

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10861255/Over-100-Britons-caught-monkeypox-Health-chiefs-spot-16-cases.html


Over 100 Britons have now caught monkeypox: Health chiefs spot another 16 cases amid fears tropical virus may never be eliminated
• Epidemiologist warned that new cases may slow down but risk is they will 'not be eliminated in some places'
• Dr Adam Kucharski [a UK Government scientist and epidemiologist], said this means monkeypox may spread to animals and become well-established in UK
• Experts are confident monkeypox won't turn into a pandemic like COVID because it does not spread as easily

Another 16 cases of monkeypox have been spotted among Britons, pushing the UK total above 100 --- as health officials plan to start isolating infected people's pets.

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said the new patients were all based in England. There have been 106 across Britain since the first was detected on [6 May 2022].

Wales and Northern Ireland yesterday [26 May 2022] declared their 1st cases, while Scotland has so far logged 3.

Health chiefs are alarmed about the ever-growing cluster of cases, given that until now the smallpox-like infection was confined to a handful of people with travel links to Africa. The majority are among gay and bisexual men.

A scientific group advising the UK Government has called for the pet hamsters, rabbits and other rodents owned by infected patients to be isolated for 3 weeks. The Human Animal Infections and Risk Surveillance (HAIRS) group said these animals were at the highest risk of catching the virus, and they could spread it into wild populations.

Experts fear that if the virus is unleashed into wild animal populations then it will become endemic and be hard to eradicate, as is the case in parts of western and central Africa.

In new guidance issued today [27 May 2022], the group said: 'Based on current evidence, for pet rodents in households where there are infected people, temporary removal from the household for a limited quarantine period (21 days) and testing to exclude infection is recommended, particularly where there are infected human contacts who have had close direct and prolonged contact with the animal or its bedding and/or litter.'

The panel warned that hedgehogs, rats, mice, squirrels, rabbits and hares could all harbour the virus if monkeypox was to spill into Britain's wildlife populations.

Officials are confident the monkeypox outbreak will not grow exponentially like COVID, saying the risk to the public remains low.

However, they have urged Britons, especially men who have sex with men, to be on the look out for any new rashes or lesions, which appear like spots, ulcers or blisters, on any part of their body. Anyone worried about a rash is advised to call their sexual health clinic immediately.

Across the world, 20 countries have now been affected by the current outbreak, with Finland today [27 May 2022] becoming the latest to confirm an infection. Additionally, Argentina, Bolivia and Sudan are all probing suspected cases.

Teams from the UKHSA are contacting high-risk contacts of confirmed cases and advising them to self-isolate at home for 3 weeks and avoid contact with children.

Both confirmed cases and close contacts are being offered the Imvanex vaccine to form a buffer of immune people around a confirmed case to limit the spread of the disease. The strategy, known as ring vaccination, has been used in previous monkeypox outbreaks and is also being carried out in some EU countries.

Dr Susan Hopkins, the UKHSA's chief medical adviser, said: 'We are continuing to promptly identify further monkeypox cases in England through our extensive surveillance and contact tracing networks, our vigilant NHS services, and thanks to people coming forward with symptoms.

'We are asking people to look out for new spots, ulcers or blisters on any part of their body. 'If anyone suspects they might have these, particularly if they have recently had a new sexual partner, they should limit their contact with others and contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service as soon as possible, though please phone ahead before attending in person.'

Monkeypox has an incubation period of anywhere up to 21 days, meaning it can take 3 weeks for symptoms to appear.

Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, which then spreads to other parts of the body -- including the genitals. The rash can look like chickenpox or syphilis, and scabs can form which then fall off.

The current outbreak, first detected in a traveller from Nigeria to the UK on [6 May 2022], has been linked to several super-spreader events, including a gay pride festival in Gran Canaria, a fetish festival in Belgium and a 'sauna' in Spain. Experts this week revealed sexual transmission at these events is the leading theory behind the origins of the current cluster of cases.

There are already fears the global outbreak of monkeypox may mean it can never be eradicated in the UK and Europe forever.

Dogs, cats and other pets will be allowed to stay in the home with their owner but must undergo 'regular vet checks' after their isolation period to make sure they do not have the virus.

Justine Shotton, president of the British Veterinary Association, said the association was monitoring the situation closely. She believes the risk of infecting pets remains low but is 'supportive of a cautious approach' while officials seek to learn more about the virus.

Ms Shotton said: 'It would be a sensible decision to keep your distance from a pet while in quarantine. If I was diagnosed with monkeypox I would do whatever I could to limit contact, such as asking a friend or relative to take care of it.' She added: 'There is currently no evidence of transmission between humans and cats and dogs but we know rabbits and rodents are susceptible.

'If you have concerns about your pets health -- if they have a fever, respiratory issues, poor appetite or lethargy -- speak to a vet. 'The chances are it will be something other than monkeypox but it's worth getting it checked.'

It comes after an ex-WHO official claimed monkeypox may have been spreading under the radar in Europe for 4 years.

Professor David Heymann, a former former director-general for health security and environment at the WHO, said the current global outbreak may date back to a handful of isolated cases in the UK in 2018. In September 2018, 2 Britons were diagnosed with the tropical disease in after returning from Nigeria. A 3rd case was found in an NHS worker who treated one of the patients.

In December 2019, a 4th person unrelated to the previous 3 tested positive for the virus after returning from Nigeria. There were 3 further cases with similar travel history that arrived in 2021.

Professor Heymann suggested the virus may have been seeded in around this time and spread unchecked. All of the cases are believed to have had the milder western African clade of the virus -- the same one that is spreading now.

How is the UK managing the outbreak?
------------------------------------
MailOnline revealed close contacts of monkeypox cases, including NHS workers, are being offered the Imvanex smallpox vaccine. The strategy, known as ring vaccination, involves jabbing and monitoring anyone around an infected person to form a buffer of immune people to limit the spread of a disease.

Additionally, close contacts of those with a confirmed monkeypox infection are being told to stay at home for 21 days and avoid contact with under age12s, immunosuppressed people and pregnant women.

The Government said unprotected direct contact or high risk environmental contact includes living in the same house as someone with monkeypox, having sexual contact with them or even just changing their bedding 'without appropriate PPE'.

As with Covid, someone who has come within one metre [3 ft] of an infected person is classed as a monkeypox contact.

This lower category of contact, which also includes sitting next to a person with monkeypox on a plane, means a tracer will call the person every day for 3 weeks and they will be advised to stay off work for 21 days if their job involves children or immuno-suppressed colleagues.

The UK has stopped short of requiring people by law to quarantine if they develop monkeypox, but ministers are considering a public health campaign to alert gay and bisexual men, because of the number of cases in this group.

What if it continues to spread?
--------------------------------
Experts told MailOnline they 'could see a role' for a targeted jab rollout to gay men in the UK 'if this isn't brought under control quickly'.

Close contacts of the UK's known cases are already being offered the jab, which was originally designed for smallpox. The 2 rash-causing viruses are very similar.

A health source told MailOnline 'there would be a number of strategies we'd look at' if cases continued to rise.

Professor Kevin Fenton, London's public health regional director, said if the outbreak in the capital continues to grow then the rollout of vaccines and treatments could be broadened to more groups.

He said there are 'plans in place' to have more antivirals if the outbreak keeps growing.

Is there a vaccine for it?
---------------------------
The smallpox vaccine, called Imvanex in the UK and Jynneos in the US, can protect against monkeypox because the viruses behind the illnesses are closely related. Data shows it prevents around 85% of cases, and has been used 'off-label' in the UK since 2018.

The jab, thought to cost £20 [USD 25] per dose, contains a modified _vaccinia_ virus, which is similar to both smallpox and monkeypox, but does not cause disease in people.

Because of its similarity to the pox viruses, antibodies produced against this virus offer cross protection.

Are there any drugs to treat it?
---------------------------------
There are a handful of antivirals and therapies for smallpox that appear to work on monkeypox. This includes the drug tecovirimat, which was approved for monkeypox in the EU in January [2022]. Tecovirimat prevents the virus from leaving an infected cell, hindering the spread of the virus within the body.

An injectable antiviral used to treat AIDS called cidofovir can be used to manage the infection, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It also works by stopping the growth of the virus.

[The UK Health Security Agency's Human Animal Infections and Risk Surveillance (HAIRS) group has issued a qualitative assessment of the risk of the human population of monkeypox infection in a canine, feline, mustelid, lagomorph or rodent UK pet. This assessment states, "As the numbers of affected households in the UK related to the current outbreak are rapidly increasing, this warrants a more thorough assessment of the risk posed by mammalian pets exposed to monkeypox virus to people with whom they may come into contact.

"For the purposes of the assessment, it is presumed the pet is present in the contaminated household of a confirmed human monkeypox case. The risk posed is therefore to the non-infected human contacts or in-contact peridomestic or wild rodents. It is concluded that the highest risk is posed by the presence of pet rodents, more so than lagomorphs, canids, felids and mustelids.

"It is unlikely (but cannot be ruled out) that an infected rodent pet could spread infection to peridomestic or wild rodents. As rodents may not show clinical signs of infection, and the incubation period is unknown, testing to detect the presence of antibodies as well as virus would provide more confidence in ruling out infection."

Monkeypox can be contained if we act now, WHO says
--------------------------------------------------
Countries should take quick steps to contain the spread of monkeypox and share data about their vaccine stockpiles, a senior World Health Organization (WHO) official said on Friday [27 May 2022].

"We think that if we put in place the right measures now we probably can contain this easily," Sylvie Briand, WHO director for Global Infectious Hazard Preparedness, told the UN agency's annual assembly.

Monkeypox is a usually mild viral infection that is endemic in parts of west and central Africa. It spreads chiefly through close contact and until the recent outbreak, was rarely seen in other parts of the world, which is why the recent emergence of cases in Europe, the United States and other areas has raised alarms.

So far, there are about 300 confirmed or suspected cases in around 20 countries where the virus was not previously circulating.

"For us, we think that the key priority currently is trying to contain this transmission in non-endemic countries," Briand told a technical briefing for member states.

Needed measures included the early detection and isolation of cases and contact tracing, she added.

Member states should also share information about 1st generation stockpiles of smallpox vaccines which can also be effective against monkeypox, Briand said.

"We don't know exactly the number of doses available in the world and so that's why we encourage countries to come to WHO and tell us what are their stockpiles," she said. A slide of her presentation described global supplies as "very constrained".

Currently, WHO officials are advising against mass vaccination, instead suggesting targeted vaccination where available for close contacts of people infected.

"Case investigation, contact tracing, isolation at home will be your best bets," said Rosamund Lewis, WHO head of the smallpox secretariat which is part of the WHO Emergencies Programme.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) recommends EU/EEA countries focus on prompt identification, management, contact tracing and reporting of new monkeypox cases. Countries should also update their contact tracing mechanisms, the diagnostic capacity for orthopoxviruses, and review the availability of smallpox vaccines, antivirals and personal protective equipment for health professionals.

The 1st case of monkeypox has been identified in the Republic of Ireland. Irish health authorities were alerted to the case on Friday evening [27 May 2022] in the east of the country.

The Health Service Executive (HSE) said the person infected with the virus has not been hospitalised.

Authorities are awaiting the results of another suspected case.

In a statement, the HSE said: "This was not unexpected following the presence of monkeypox cases in the UK and many European countries."

The case is the 2nd to be found on the island after Northern Ireland confirmed its 1st case on Thursday [26 May 2022].

"A public health risk assessment has been undertaken, and those who were in contact with the person are being advised on what to do in the event that they become ill," the spokesperson added.

Spanish health authorities reported 25 new cases of monkeypox on Thursday [26 May 2022], bringing the total tally of infections in one of the main hot spots of the recent outbreak to 84.

The Health Ministry, which now considers all non-human-origin pox infections as monkeypox after a positive test while before only counting those confirmed by sequencing, also said there were 73 suspected cases.

Minister of Health Carolina Darias on Wednesday [25 May 2022] said Spain would buy monkeypox vaccines as part of the EU joint vaccine purchases and confirmed that the west African strain, which has a fatality rate in about 1% of cases, was the one detected in Spain.

Spain, England and Portugal are the countries with the most cases in the recent outbreak of the usually mild viral disease outside its endemic areas in parts of west and central Africa.

Spain's neighbour Portugal confirmed 9 new infections on Thursday [26 May 2022], bringing the total to 58.

Portugal's health authority DGS said the country was taking steps to establish a vaccine reserve through the European mechanism and was considering vaccinating the contacts of confirmed cases and health professionals.

Most of the infections detected globally so far have not been severe. Many, but not all, have been reported in men who have sex with men. Symptoms include fever and a distinctive bumpy rash.

Malta's 1st case of monkeypox has been announced by the health ministry. The case involves a 38-year-old male who had been recently abroad in one of the countries hit by the monkeypox outbreak.

The ministry reported light symptoms that did not require hospitalisation, and the patient is currently self-isolating at home.

"Monkeypox is a rare infection caused by a virus that does not spread easily from one person to the other," the ministry said in a statement. "In the majority of cases it is a brief illness that does not require care and from which patients recover in weeks."

The public health authorities are calling on the public to maintain hygiene with regular handwashing with soap, or alcohol-based sanitiser, especially when in contact with someone who is not well.

This week, Health Minister Chris Fearne had said that monkeypox was not "another COVID" and stressed that the authorities were well prepared in case of an outbreak.

Israel has confirmed a 2nd case of the rare monkeypox virus, in a 30-year-old man who recently returned from an overseas trip.

The man was hospitalized on Friday [27 May 2022] at the Sheba Medical Center in Tel Aviv, and was released after a short while. He was confirmed to be infected with the virus on Saturday [28 May 2022].

The new infection came just over a week after Israel discovered its 1st case of the virus, in a man in his 30s who had returned from a trip to western Europe.

Israeli health officials have played down the risk of the virus. In a phone briefing last Sunday [22 May 2022], the Health Ministry's head of public health services, Dr. Sharon Alroy-Preis, urged calm and said the recent outbreak of the virus was not a major risk to public health.

A case of the virus was diagnosed in Israel in 2018, and no known community infections resulted from it.

[This case is different from all recently reported cases in the USA and in Europe in that the woman acquired her monkeypox (MPX) virus infection in an African country that is endemic for the virus. Cases in women are also unusual. So far in the MPX outbreak, the overwhelming majority of cases are in men, most between 20-50 years. - Mod.TY]

Health officials in Mexico confirmed Saturday [28 May 2022] the country's 1st known case of monkeypox, in a 50-year-old US resident being treated in Mexico City.

The man, a permanent resident of New York City, "was probably infected in the Netherlands," Hugo Lopez-Gatell, an undersecretary of health, said on Twitter.

"Fortunately, he is stable and in preventive isolation," Lopez-Gatell said. "We hope he will recover without complications."

He provided no information on the patient's possible contacts with other people.

On Friday [27 May 2022], health authorities in Argentina confirmed the 1st 2 known cases of the disease anywhere in Latin America -- those of a 40-year-old man who had returned to Argentina from Spain, and of a Spaniard who was visiting Buenos Aires.

The 2 cases apparently were unconnected.

The monkeypox virus can be transmitted to humans by infected animals. Person-to-person transmission is possible but rare [Not so rare during the current outbreak. - Mod.TY].

Monkeypox is related to smallpox but is much less severe. Initial symptoms include a high fever, swollen lymph nodes and a chickenpox-like rash.

There is no specific treatment but vaccination against smallpox has been found to be about 85% effective in preventing monkeypox.

Monkeypox virus can stay in the blood and throat
------------------------------------------------
In a study published in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases [reference below], experts have revealed that the monkeypox virus may persist in the body of an infected individual for up to 10 weeks, even after the tell-tale rash has disappeared.

"It remains positive in the throat and blood for the length of the illness and maybe even long after the rash," the lead author Dr Hugh Adler was quoted as saying.

Traditionally, monkeypox patients are considered infectious while they have the common symptoms of the disease, such as skin rashes and lesions, etc. However, now experts are saying that the virus may remain in the body of infected individuals even after their rashes have disappeared and scabs have fallen off.

Detection of viral DNA was by PCR so presence of intact, infectious virus is unknown. This interesting report should elicit further studies on persistence of the virus in infected individuals. If infectious virus is, indeed, shed in secretions after crusts are gone, that could change the epidemiological picture and recommendations for long-term testing and isolation. - Mod.TY]

[15] Key questions for researchers
Date: Fri 27 May 2022

Nature outlines some of the key questions about the recent outbreaks that researchers are racing to answer.

How did the current outbreaks start?
------------------------------------
Since the latest outbreaks began, researchers have sequenced viral genomes collected from people with monkeypox in countries including Belgium, France, Germany, Portugal and the United States. The most important insight they have gained so far is that each of the sequences closely resembles that of a monkeypox strain found in western Africa. The strain is less-lethal -- it has a death rate below 1% in poor, rural populations -- than another that has been detected in central Africa and has a death rate up to 10%.

Clues have also emerged as to how the outbreak might have begun. Although researchers need more data to confirm their suspicions, the sequences they have evaluated so far are nearly identical, suggesting that the recent outbreaks outside of Africa might all be linked back to a single case with a thorough epidemiological investigation.

The current sequences are most similar to those from a smattering of monkeypox cases that arose outside of Africa in 2018 and 2019 and that were linked to travel in western Africa. The simplest explanation is that the person who had the 1st non-African case this year [2022] -- who has still not been identified -- became infected through contact with an animal or human carrying the virus while visiting a similar part of Africa, says Bernie Moss, a virologist at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease in Bethesda, Maryland.

But other explanations cannot be ruled out, says Gustavo Palacios, a virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. It's possible, that the virus was already circulating, undetected, outside of Africa in humans or animals, introduced during earlier outbreaks. This hypothesis, however, is less likely because the monkeypox virus usually causes visible lesions on people's bodies -- which would probably be brought to the attention of a physician.

Can a genetic change in the virus explain the latest outbreaks?
---------------------------------------------------------------
Understanding whether there is a genetic basis for the virus's unprecedented spread outside Africa will be incredibly difficult, says Elliot Lefkowitz, a computational virologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who has studied poxvirus evolution. Researchers are still struggling to characterize precisely which genes are responsible for the higher virulence and transmissibility of the central African strain, compared with the west African one, more than 17 years after they identified a difference between the 2.

One reason for this is that poxvirus genomes contain many mysteries, Lefkowitz says. The monkeypox genome is enormous relative to that of many other viruses -- it is more than 6 times as large as the genome for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. That means they're at least "6 times harder to analyse", says Rachel Roper, a virologist at East Carolina University in Greenville, North Carolina.

Palacios says another reason is that few resources have been dedicated to genomic surveillance efforts in Africa, where monkeypox has been a public-health concern for many years. So virologists are flying somewhat blind right now, because they have few sequences to which they can compare the new monkeypox sequences, he says. Funding agencies have not heeded scientists who have been warning for more than a decade that further monkeypox outbreaks could occur, he adds.

Ifedayo Adetifa, the head of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control says that African virologists he's spoken with have expressed irritation that they've struggled to garner funding and publish studies about monkeypox for years -- but now that it's spread outside the continent, public-health authorities worldwide suddenly seem more interested.

To understand how the virus evolves, it would also be useful to sequence the virus in animals, Palacios says. The virus is known to infect animals -- mainly rodents such as squirrels and rats -- but scientists have yet to discover its natural animal reservoir in the impacted areas of Africa.

Can the outbreaks be contained?
-------------------------------
Since the current outbreaks began, some nations have been procuring smallpox vaccines, which are thought to be highly effective against monkeypox, because the viruses are related. Unlike the vaccines against COVID-19, which take up to 2 weeks to offer full protection, smallpox vaccines are thought to protect against monkeypox infection if administered within 4 days of exposure because of the virus's long incubation period, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia.

If deployed, the vaccines would probably be applied using a 'ring vaccination' strategy, which would inoculate close contacts of infected people. Andrea McCollum, an epidemiologist who heads the poxvirus team at the CDC, says the agency is not yet deploying a ring vaccination strategy. But in the meantime, CNN reports that the United States plans to offer smallpox vaccines for some healthcare workers treating infected people. It might also be worth considering vaccinating groups at higher risk of infection in addition to close contacts of infected people, Rimoin says.

Even if public-health officials halt transmission of monkeypox in humans during the current outbreaks, virologists are also concerned that the virus could spill back into animals. Having new reservoirs of virus in animals would increase the probability of it being transmitted to people again and again, including in countries that don't host any known animal reservoirs of the virus. On [23 May 2022], the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control highlighted this possibility, but deemed the probability as "very low". Still, European health officials strongly recommended that pet rodents such as hamsters and guinea pigs belonging to people with confirmed cases of monkeypox be isolated and monitored in government facilities or euthanized to avoid the possibility of spillover.

Although the risk is low, Moss says the main concern is that scientists wouldn't know if such a spillover event occurred until it was too late, because infected animals don't typically show the same visible symptoms as humans.

Is the virus spreading differently now compared with previous outbreaks?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Monkeypox virus is known to spread through close contact with the lesions, bodily fluids and respiratory droplets of infected people or animals. But health officials have been examining sexual activity at 2 raves in Spain and Belgium as drivers of monkeypox transmission, according to the Associated Press, raising speculation that the virus has evolved to become more adept at sexual transmission.

Cases linked to sexual activity don't mean that the virus is more contagious or is transmitted sexually, however -- just that the virus spreads readily through close contact, Rimoin says. Unlike SARS-CoV-2, which isn't thought to linger on surfaces much, poxviruses can survive for a long time outside the body, making surfaces such as bedsheets and doorknobs a potential vector of transmission, Roper says.

Although health officials have noted that many cases have been among men who have sex with men (MSM), Rimoin emphasizes that the most likely explanation for the virus's spread among MSM groups is that the virus was coincidentally introduced into the community, and it has continued spreading there.

All of the new attention on monkeypox has laid bare just how much scientists have yet to understand about the virus, McCollum says. "When this has all settled down, I think we'll have to think long and hard about where the research priorities are," she says.

[These are important monkeypox (MPX) questions that need answers. If the current monkeypox outbreak outside of Africa dies down and ends, will there be the support needed to adequately find the answers to these key questions? If circulation of MPX virus continues in the gay and transexual community indefinitely, will it become stigmatized as AIDS was early on, lessening the support for needed research and, especially, preventive action? If MPX virus becomes established in native rodent populations, will the conclusion be that nothing can be done to eliminate it, so further action other than warning the public, will not be justified? - Mod.TY]
