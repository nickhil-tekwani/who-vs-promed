[Re: ProMED-mail Poliomyelitis update (29): comment 20131129.2082683]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Prof John's comments on polio policy in ProMED [29 Nov 2013] do not address the key point of the recent 2013 experience of WPV1 infection in the sewage in Israel and in the adjacent Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza. Israel had no polio cases despite the widespread presence of WPV1 in the environment, which is attributed to the high level of IPV immunization and sanitation, but lack of OPV [oral polio vaccine] for prevention of viral seeding in the sewage system. In contrast, the Palestinian territories have used a combined OPV/IPV [inactivated polio vaccine] policy in effect since 1978 also with very high coverage and had less than 10 percent of the WPV sewage finding that Israel had in 2013 and also had no polio cases. The use of OPV gave a protective effect in preventing entry of the WPV to the West Bank and Gaza.

WHO and CDC are seemingly committed to an IPV only policy not only for the industrialized countries but also for medium and low income countries. We consider this inappropriate and potentially dangerous especially in countries such as India with low immunization coverage and poor sanitary conditions. Indeed it is also dangerous for the wealthy countries now practicing IPV-only policies. Despite high immunization coverage and standards of sanitation, WPV can easily be imported and spread via travelers, refugees from Africa and the Middle East.

We urge the WHO, CDC, GAVI and other policy makers on polio eradication to reconsider their IPV-only policies and accept the safer and less expensive OPV/IPV combined policy as the way forward learning from the experience we reported in the Lancet of [16 Nov 2013]. One or 2 doses of IPV in the routine immunization program (together with DPT [diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), and tetanus], polio, and Hib [_Haemophilus influenzae_ type b]) in combined vaccine followed by 3 doses of OPV in the 1st year and a booster dose of OPV at age 6 would be suitable. This would provide the individual and community protection as seen in the "natural experiment" in the Palestinian and Israeli situation.

[In deciding vaccination recommendations, one of the key analyses facing policy makers involves an assessment of the risk-benefit equation surrounding the recommendation. The switch to a pure IPV policy in the USA took approximately 20 years of discussion and assessment following the transition in the epidemiology of the disease in the USA so that after 1979, with the exception of imported cases of WPV associated paralysis, the only cases of locally acquired paralytic disease seen were associated with infection with the vaccine virus (VAPP -- vaccine associated paralytic polio)(ref 1). The USA transitioned to a mixed IPV followed by OPV schedule to a pure IPV vaccination policy by 2000 (refs 2 and 3). The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) concluded in June 1999 that to eliminate the risk of VAPP the recommended polio vaccination schedule should be an all-IPV schedule for routine childhood immunizations (refs 3, 4, 5). OPV was to be used for:

"1. Mass vaccination campaigns to control outbreaks of paralytic polio.
2. Unvaccinated children who will be traveling in less than 4 weeks to areas where polio is endemic.
3. Children of parents who do not accept the recommended number of vaccine injections. These children may receive OPV only for the 3rd or 4th dose or both; in this situation, healthcare providers should administer OPV only after discussing the risk for VAPP with parents or caregivers."

Since changing to an all-IPV immunization schedule in 2000, there have been only 2 cases of VAPP reported in the USA, one was an imported case and one was in a genetically immunocompromised person who was most likely exposed to OPV before its use was discontinued in 2000 (ref 6).

In 1990, Israel began vaccination against polio using a combined vaccine program with 3 doses of IPV followed by 3 doses of OPV (oral polio vaccine). This schedule was used until 2005, when OPV was eliminated from the schedule to use 4 doses of IPV by the age of 15 months and an IPV booster dose in 1st grade (ages 5-6 years) (ref 7). The continued transmission of the WPV over the period of 6-8 months in a population that was highly vaccinated in the absence of actual cases of paralytic disease demonstrated the strengths of the IPV policy, vis a vis protection of the vaccinated individuals, although at the same time, demonstrated the weaknesses of the IPV vaccination policy through the continued circulation of the WPV as found in sewage samples throughout Israel. The identification of genetically similar WPVs from sewage samples in Egypt, Israel, the West Bank, Gaza (with no AFP cases associated with infection with these WPVs), and those circulating in Syria associated with paralytic disease suggests that an appropriate strategy to interrupt the transmission of the WPV in the region would be to have vaccination campaigns based on the use of the OPV in the region.

That being said, as stated in previous ProMED-mail posts, this moderator has been a strong proponent of the use of IPV when the risk of exposure to WPV is significantly less than the risk of infection and illness from a vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV). There are many questions that arise related to the timing of vaccine switch (OPV to IPV) and necessary monitoring to identify "silent" circulation of WPV at the global level, before vaccination can be ended.
