Leprosy case diagnosed in Michigan, man was frequent visitor to Florida
------------------------------------------------
Florida was heavily in the news cycle about 2 months ago as the 9th case of leprosy was confirmed in a Flagler County resident. Now, Michigan media are reporting a leprosy case in a man who is described as a frequent visitor to the Sunshine State.

Dr. Frank McGeorge explained the association with the 9-banded armadillo found in Florida, Louisiana and Texas where as many as 20 percent of armadillos carry _Mycobacterium leprae_, the etiologic agent that causes leprosy. "Armadillos likely acquired it when colonists came to America", McGeorge stated.

The Michigan resident who was diagnosed with leprosy has been seen by multiple doctors for 3 years before a skin sample analyzed revealed leprosy.

The USA sees approximately 150 to 250 leprosy cases annually. During the 10-year period of 2004 to 2014, Florida reported 92 cases,
averaging fewer than 10 per year.

Leprosy is a chronic bacterial disease that primarily affects the skin, peripheral nerves and upper airway. Feared as a highly contagious and devastating disease, it is well established that Hansen's disease (leprosy) is not highly transmissible, is very treatable, and, with early diagnosis and treatment, is not disabling.

Genotyping of _Mycobacterium leprae_ from patients with multibacillary leprosy has found the same highly specific strain of _M. leprae_ in armadillos that were captured in the wild in 5 southern states in the US (Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas) and in patients who had never lived outside the USA and Mexico and who resided in states with leprosy-infected armadillos (1). This genotype had not been reported previously elsewhere in the world. In patients whose risk was foreign residence only, the genotype was typical for the strains found in that foreign region.
