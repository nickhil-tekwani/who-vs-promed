increased food supply which then fosters the reproduction of the amoebae.
Might not some kind of predictive tool been used to anticipate this
problem? For how long have we known that high water temperatures foster
bacterial growth? Will we remember this next year, or whenever Texas again
experiences this extreme weather? <<
We and others have generated predictive models for _Naegleria fowleri_
enrichment in bodies of water (Huizinga and McLaughlin, 1990, Applied and
Envir Micro 56(7):2200-5), and molecular assays for its detection
(McLaughlin et al, 1991, JCM 29(2):333-5. Warmer water progressively rather
than stocastically enriched for thermophiles and thermotolerent amoeba of
all species and strains, all of which are bactivores. _N. fowerli_ is the
most thermotolerent _Naegleria_, which fluorishes with the many other
species that tolerate warm temperature. However _N. fowleri_ and a small
subset of the Acanthamoeba species are able also to invade and survive in
human tissue, and this makes them dangerous when inoculated at high levels
to susceptible humans. I think the immune history of swimmers is crucial;
exposures to related amoeba species may enhance or prevent infections.
When PAM is recurrent, as it has been in some lakes in Virginia and
Florida, warnings are posted late in warm seasons. Water temperature data
matched to numbers of _N. fowleri_ would give some predictive power about
risks, but the overall incidence of PAM remains so low that the costs of
recreational shut-downs will far exceed any potential benefits of lives
saved, which may be one per lake per thousand years.
I suspect that immunotherapy (e.g. passive transfer of high-titer
antibodies, or addition of appropriate immunomodulators and/or antigens)
coupled with aggressive drug therapy, may be able to rescue more of the
afflicted patients. This has not been a priority because of the rarity of
the condition.
