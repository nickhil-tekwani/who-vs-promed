Humanitarian Tracker, a nonprofit, volunteer-based organization, has been crowdsourcing information on disease spread, atrocities and humanitarian needs in Syria since March 2011. We are currently working with a team of clinicians on the ground in Syria on a disease surveillance project. We're looking for experts inside or outside Syria (of Syrian origin) to be part of an advisory team with the following specialties:

- Epidemiologist
- Virologist
- Neurologist
- Pediatrician
- Public Health Surveillance

If you are interested, please email us at:
<info@humanitariantracker.org>

Kind regards,

[Efforts to obtain accurate and complete data on the situation in Syria in support of humanitarian efforts are to be applauded. Please send replies directly to Dr. Kass-Hout. - Mod.LM]
