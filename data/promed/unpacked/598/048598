Daniel Lavenchy, head of the WHO influenza program, has confirmed that the
boy who died of H5N1 influenza caught it from infected chickens. The 3
year-old child had been in contact with poultry on farms shortly before his
death. [This would mean that the chickens in his nursey school class room
were not infected and would account for the absence of any other cases
among the students. DP Scientists are still working on how the virus
jumped species. A final report on the case is scheduled for
end-of-the-year release.

[On the other hand, no evidence for "confirmation" is presented. I'll wait
for additional details. - Mod.CHC
