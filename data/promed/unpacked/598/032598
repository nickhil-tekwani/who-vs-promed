West Nile fever (WNF) is a mosquitoborne disease which causes severe neurological symptoms in a small proportion of infected people. During the June-to-November transmission season, ECDC [European Centre for Disease Prevention & Control] monitors the situation in EU member states and neighbouring countries in order to inform blood safety authorities of WNF-affected areas and identify significant changes in the epidemiology of the disease.

During the past week, Austria reported its 1st case of West Nile fever, detected in an asymptomatic blood donor from Vienna.

In neighbouring countries, Serbia reported a laboratory-confirmed case of West Nile virus infection in the Juzno-Banatski district. This is the 1st case reported by Serbia in the current transmission season.

Israel reported 4 new cases diagnosed [so far] in August in the following areas: Northern District (2), Tel Aviv (1) and Central District (1).

All these areas were also affected in the previous transmission season.

[WN fever cases are beginning to be detected in a variety of countries in Europe. An increasing number of cases in humans and equine animals can be expected in Europe over the coming 2-3 months. WNV has been present in Europe since the 1950s and is transmitted by mosquitoes.

In 2011 ECDC started to implement West Nile fever surveillance during the mosquito transmission season in order to inform the blood safety authorities in Europe of areas in the EU and the neighborhood with West Nile cases; according to EU legislation, blood donors from such areas should be deferred or tested.

Avoidance of mosquito bites is the only practical way for people to avoid WNV infection. Although the above report makes no mention of risk of WNV infections of equine animals, equine cases do occur in Europe, and owners in endemic areas should vaccinate their animals.
