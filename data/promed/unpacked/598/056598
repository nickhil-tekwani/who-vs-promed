[Epizootic haemorrhagic disease (EHD) is caused by a virus of the family _Reoviridae_, genus _Orbivirus_, which can infect most wild and domestic ruminants. It was considered an emerging disease in cattle, added to the OIE list of notifiable diseases in May 2008, following outbreaks in 4 Mediterranean countries. Morbidity and mortality may be as high as 90% in white-tailed deer (as manifested seasonally in North America). However, severity varies depending on the year and geographical location. There are 8 or more serotypes, and Ibaraki virus is a member of the EHD virus (EHDV) serogroup (serotype 2). EHDV demonstrates immunological cross-reactivity with the Bluetongue virus group. Virus is transmitted by biological vectors, usually biting midges of the genus _Culicoides_, after an external extrinsic period of 10-14 days. In temperate regions, infection is most common in the late summer and autumn during peak vector population, while infection occurs throughout the year in tropical regions. Parts of the above and additional information on EHD are available in OIE's disease card at https://tinyurl.com/ycv2bgtj.

According to OIE's summary, as of 14 Dec 2020, a total of 27 EHD outbreaks have been reported from Israel this season (starting 14 Oct 2020), of which 19 were dairy milking cattle farms, 7 beef herds and one farm of fattening calves.

OIE's summary includes the following epidemiological statistics (heads of cattle):

Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
5160 / 355 / 6 / 4 / -
(Data from one affected dairy operation, in Kibbutz Lavi, were not included.)

The said summary, as well as details of each of the 27 outbreaks and a map presenting their geographical locations, is available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000037061_20201214_141510.pdf. As apparent from the map, the event involved vast parts of the country. The northern cluster borders southern Lebanon, southwest Syria and northwest Jordan. Most likely, the _Culicoides_-borne EHD virus is currently circulating in these territories as well, and possibly beyond -- within the eastern Mediterranean region.

EHD was diagnosed in Israel for the 1st time in September 2006. This event, caused by EHD serotype 7, involved more than 100 outbreaks and inflicted significant economic losses. The next EHD event took place in 2015, involving a total of 43 outbreaks. Losses were less severe; the causative pathogen was serotype 6. In 2016, an event of smaller proportions (about 30 outbreaks) took place, reportedly caused by serotypes 1 and 6. The serotype of the current event is not yet available; according to (unofficial, yet to be confirmed) information, it is not one of the 3 serotypes reported in the earlier events.

Since 2009, EHD has been officially reported to the OIE from 3 additional countries/geographically distinct locations: Reunion (2009), Tunisia (2010) and Guadeloupe (2010). The OIE report of the 2009 event in Reunion, a French territory, Indian Ocean island in East Africa, east of Madagascar, included the comment: "This disease had already been diagnosed in cattle in 2003 in La Reunion with a similar epidemiology to the current episode"; the epidemiology of the episode was not specified. The Guadeloupe (similarly, a French territory) event of 2010 involved 10 cattle introduced from mainland France (which is free from EHD). As the report stated, they "served thus as sentinels." This event is still signed on OIE's global EHD map as "continuing"; see at https://tinyurl.com/ybsadqo8.

EHD is not zoonotic. To the best of our knowledge, there are currently no licensed commercial vaccines available for EHD. - Mod.AS
