Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments
Ducks are mostly raised in these localities near Lake Albert. Mortality has been higher in ducks than in hens. Positive samples have been taken on 21 ducks and one hen. Quantitative information provided concerns the ducks. H5N8 avian influenza virus is present in the neighboring country Uganda. Dense trade exchanges, mainly of poultry and poultry products, between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda should not be overlooked. Duck mortality is high in Joo and Kafe. Surveillance has been reinforced in the containment zone to prevent the spread of the disease to the other Ituri territories. Other investigations are planned shortly in other territories of the province.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, quarantine, zoning, vaccination prohibited, no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone, stamping out, disinfection

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Central veterinary laboratory of Kinshasa (National laboratory)/ Birds / real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 24 May 2017 / Positive

Future reporting
