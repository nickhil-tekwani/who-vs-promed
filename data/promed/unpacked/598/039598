The Council of Agriculture (COA) ordered an across-the-board slaughter of
goats raised in a ranch in the southern county of Kaohsiung on Thursday
after confirming 159 of its animals had been infected with the
foot-and-mouth (FMD) disease.
"An overnight examination shows 42 [goat kids at the A-Lien township ranch
which died in the past few days had all been infected with the O-Kinmen
strain FMD virus," said a COA quarantine official. The A-Lien ranch, owned
by a farmer surnamed Chen, raised a total of 295 dairy and meat goats. It
was the latest goat-related FMD case since a similar outbreak was reported
last week in a ranch in Changhua county's Fangyuan township in central Taiwan.
Chen said all of his goats had received vaccination since the COA issued an
order on 17 Feb 2000 that all cloven-hoofed livestock on the island must be
inoculated within 10 days. "I simply couldn't understand why my goats still
succumbed to the deadly FMD virus," a frustrated Chen complained.
In addition to demanding an across-the-board slaughter of Chen's animals,
the COA has banned movement of cloven-hoofed livestock raised in the nearby
region and launched sterilizing measures to prevent further spread of the
disease. The COA renewed its call on ranch operators around the island to
have their cloven-hoofed animals inoculated.
There are currently 20-plus goat ranches in A-Lien township, raising a
total of 5000 dairy and meat goats.
Quarantine officials said since the O-Kinmen strain virus caused an
outbreak of FMD among cattle in the frontline island of Kinmen and in
several southern Taiwan ranches last summer, all cloven-hoofed livestock,
including pigs, goats, deer and cattle, have been exposed to the threat of
the deadly disease.
Alarmed by the string of cattle- and goat-related FMD cases reported in
Yunlin, Chiayi, Changhua and Kaohsiung counties since January this year,
the National Security Council has twice called meetings of officials from
all relevant government agencies to discuss the issue.
According to the COA, the virus that infected cattle and goats in Taiwan
recently was a new type probably transmitted by live animals smuggled from
mainland China. Officials said although the newly found virus belonged to
O-strain, it was more virulent than the type that caused an FMD outbreak
among local cattle population last year.
Soong Hua-tsung, deputy director of the COA's flora and fauna quarantine
and inspection bureau, said rampant smuggling of live animals and livestock
products from mainland China has posed a serious threat to Taiwan's
anti-epidemic system and livestock industry.
Soong said 3 strains of FMD viruses -- O, A and A-1 -- have been found in
mainland China. So far, only O-strain has been detected in Taiwan. "If A-
and A-1 strains are transmitted into Taiwan, the consequences will be
grave," he warned.
Soong said the COA has collected extensive information concerning live
animal smuggling from the mainland. "We'll cooperate with law enforcement
authorities closely to crack down on such illegal operations," he added.
The FMD epidemic among Taiwan's pigs in March 1997 led to the slaughter of
tens of thousands of the animals and dealt a devastating blow to the
country's pork exports, prompting the COA to order an across-the-board
vaccination at all hog farms.
In July 1999, the COA adopted its containment policy after FMD cases among
cattle were reported. Cumulatively, about 26 000 head of cattle, or some 20
percent of the country's total of 130 000, have been affected or
slaughtered after being confirmed of having been infected with FMD.

[Although vaccination was ordered, it must be of the correct strain to be
protective. Furthermore, vaccination does not provide immediate protection,
there must be time to mount an immune response. Generally, this considered
to be about 2 weeks. Chen's animals may not have had time to form an
immunological response, may have been incubating the disease at the time of
inoculation, or the strain of vaccine may have been incorrect for the stain
of outbreak. - MOD.TG
