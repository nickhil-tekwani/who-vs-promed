Denmark on Monday [3 Jan 2022] began culling 36 000 turkeys at a farm where the birds have been infected with the highly contagious avian influenza H5N1, also known as bird flu, the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration announced.

The farm, where the virus was first confirmed on 1 Jan [2022], is located near the town of Stokkemarke in Lolland municipality.

In a statement, the department, which comes under the Food, Agriculture and Fisheries Ministry, said the outbreak has hit turkeys in one of the farm's 7 buildings, and the entire flock must be killed to prevent the spread of infection.

"We have no cure for bird flu, so we have to kill all the turkeys to stop the outbreak and prevent the spread of infection," said Charlotte Vilstrup, veterinarian and office manager at the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration. "It is sad that we now have to kill so many animals again, and at the same time, a great loss of resources for society."

The task will take several days to complete, and the work is being carried out in a collaboration between the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration and the Danish Emergency Management Agency. Once the task is completed, the entire property will be cleaned and disinfected, the press release added.

Avian influenza, also known as bird flu, is a type of zoonotic (or animal) influenza that affects wild birds and poultry, according to the World Health Organization. It has occasionally infected humans; however, it does not easily transmit between humans.

The majority of human cases of avian influenza have been associated with direct or indirect contact with infected live or dead poultry.

Since it was first reported in Hong Kong in 1997, the disease has been responsible for human outbreaks and deaths in 16 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East.

[The panzootic of HPAI H5N1, starting in the fall of 2021 in Eurasia, has already spread, mainly by migrating birds, into Africa and, most recently, to America (wild birds in Canada, ProMED post 20220103.8700643).

The following timeline of HPAI H5N1 in Denmark is based upon information available on the website of the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (DVFA; https://www.foedevarestyrelsen.dk/english/Animal/AnimalHealth/Animal%20diseases/Avian_influenza/Pages/default.aspx).

- 22 Oct 2021: HPAI H5N1 detected in wild birds in Denmark. The detections were done in samples from eurasian wigeons and from a common teal originating from the Wadden Sea in the southwestern part of Denmark. These comprise the 1st detection of highly pathogenic influenza A virus in wild birds in Denmark since May 2021.

- 1 Nov 2021: HPAI H5N1 confirmed in a turkey holding with approximately 28 000 turkeys near the town of Sonderupsonder in Slagelse municipality.

- 1 Nov 2021: Denmark issues a "housing order" so that poultry must be fenced and under roof due to the increasing risk of HPAI, with exceptions.

- 3 Nov 2021: An outbreak of HPAI H5N1 confirmed in a backyard poultry holding of approx. 50 hens, ducks, and geese near the town of Boeslunde in Slagelse municipality. The birds are defined as "other captive birds" (thus not requiring certain, defined OIE measures, laid out in OIE's International Animal Health Code, chapter 10.4; https://www.oie.int/en/what-we-do/standards/codes-and-manuals/terrestrial-code-online-access/?id=169&L=1&htmfile=chapitre_avian_influenza_viruses.htm).

- 24 Nov 2021: An outbreak of HPAI H5N1 confirmed in a backyard poultry holding of 2 hens near the town of Rude in Slagelse municipality. The birds are defined as "other captive birds" (see above).

- 19 Dec 2021: An outbreak of HPAI H5N1 confirmed in a game bird holding with approximately 6000 birds, mainly pheasants and ducks, near the town of Lovel in Viborg Municipality.

- 31 Dec 2021: An outbreak of HPAI H5N1 confirmed in a backyard poultry holding with approximately 40 hens, ducks, and geese near the town of Skaverup in Vordingborg municipality. The birds are defined as "poultry" (thus requiring the application of OIE's requirements in Code chapter 10.4).

- 1 Jan 2022: An outbreak of HPAI H5N1 confirmed in a turkey holding with approximately 36 000 turkeys, near the town of Stokkemarke in Lolland municipality. This event is described in the media report above.

Notably, this is Denmark's 2nd HPAI H5N1 outbreak on a turkey farm. During a recent HPAI H5N1 outbreak in Israel, mostly turkeys and laying hens were affected.

A map presenting Europe's officially reported HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in poultry and cases in wild birds, since 1 Oct 2021 and as of 3 Jan 2022, is available at https://www.fli.de/fileadmin/FLI/Images/Tierseuchengeschehen/H5N8/Karten_EU/2022/Map_AI_EU_2022-01-03.jpg.

So far, no human infections by this strain have been reported, globally. - Mod.AS
