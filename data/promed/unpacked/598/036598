A woman and 3 children have been infected with _E. coli_ after petting animals at the Ekka show in Brisbane. The state's chief health officer Dr Jeanette Young says a 33-year-old Brisbane woman and 3 children, aged 6, 11, and 12, are being treated, but are not in hospital.

"They've obtained this infection and we know it is a very serious infection and potentially can cause significant problems," she told reporters. "It can cause severe bloody diarrhea and there is a risk it can cause severe complications."

Dr Young said there was no reason for alarm, but urged anyone who had been to the show and petted the animals to be cautious, especially people who work in childcare or in the food industry. "Anyone who's been to the Ekka, who went into the animal petting area along animal boulevard, and then developed persistent or bloody diarrhea, should go and be checked out, particularly if the symptoms continue," she said.

Enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ is a very serious, very infectious type of bacteria and can spread easily from person to person without proper hygienic practices. In rare cases it can develop into a haemolytic-uremic syndrome, which affects the kidneys, and in some cases can be fatal.

Queensland Health is working with Biosecurity Queensland, the Ekka organizers, and their contractors to find the animals potentially carrying the bacterium.

[The Ekka (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekka) is the annual agricultural show of Queensland, Australia. Its formal title is the Royal Queensland Show and it is held at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground. It was originally called the Brisbane Exhibition, however it is commonly called the Ekka, which is a shortening of the word exhibition. The Ekka is Queensland's largest annual event with recent shows drawing more than 400 000 visitors.

As with adequate cooking of ground beef, it cannot be overstressed that all visitors to petting zoos, especially children, must wash their hands after exposure to animals. - Mod.LL
