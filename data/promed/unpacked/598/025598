[Although Kenya, Sudan and countries in East Africa have been the
most frequent reporters of this disease, it has occurred from time to
time from South Africa to Egypt. In 2000, the disease was seen
outside of Africa for the 1st time in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. It has
also been seen in countries in West Africa, including Mauritania and
Senegal. Rift Valley fever (RVF) was last seen in South Africa in
1999 and, prior to that outbreak, in 1991. The last OIE disease RVF
report from Zimbabwe was in 2001; Zambia in 1997; Malawi in 2002;
Namibia in 1985; Mozambique in 1963, Madagascar in 1991; Botswana,
Lesotho and Swaziland have never reported RVF. This outbreak in
Mpumalunga is, however, quite close to Zwaziland and a little further
away from the southwestern border of Kruger National Park. See
<http://www.traveljournals.net/explore/south_africa/map/m1842803/ngwenya_hills.html>
or the OIE reference above.

The current RVF outbreak in Sudan has resulted in 698 human cases and
222 deaths. Human disease is usually preceded by a significant animal
disease event, which is not the case in this outbreak in South
Africa. Vaccination is the best way to control a disease outbreak in
animals and helps to control the subsequent transmission of RVF to
humans. Outbreaks are preceded by excessive rainfall, which promotes
large populations of the mosquito vectors which transmit the disease
among animals.

According to the WHO RVF website
<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs207/en>,
transmission occurs in the following manner:

"The vast majority of human infections result from direct or indirect
contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. The virus can
be transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during
slaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting
veterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses.
Certain occupational groups such as herders, farmers, slaughterhouse
workers and veterinarians are therefore at higher risk of infection.
The virus infects humans through inoculation, for example via a wound
from an infected knife or through contact with broken skin, or
through inhalation of aerosols produced during the slaughter of
infected animals. The aerosol mode of transmission has also led to
infection in laboratory workers. There is some evidence that humans
may also become infected with RVF by ingesting the unpasteurized or
uncooked milk of infected animals. Human infections have also
resulted from the bites of infected mosquitoes, most commonly the
_Aedes_ mosquito. Transmission of RVF virus by hematophagous
(blood-feeding) flies is also possible. To date, no human-to-human
transmission of RVF has been documented, and no transmission of RVF
to health care workers has been reported when standard infection
control precautions have been put in place. There has been no
evidence of outbreaks of RVF in urban areas."

Of note, the laboratory providing the diagnosis, OVI, is celebrating
its 100th anniversary this year (2008) and is one of the world's
great animal diagnostic laboratories, founded by Sir Arnold Theiler.
Theiler, a veterinarian by training, first made his mark preparing
vaccines used in an outbreak of smallpox in Witswatersrand in 1893.
He subsequently was the first to characterize East Coast fever and
made significant progress in combating piroplasmosis, anaplasmosis,
rhinderpest and African horse sickness. His son Max, a virologist who
had worked at OVI and moved to the Rockefeller Institute, won the
1951 Nobel prize in medicine or physiology for his vaccine work on
yellow fever. - Mod.PC]
