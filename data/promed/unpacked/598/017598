Influenza update No. 235
------------------------
[21 Apr 2015, based on data up to 5 Apr 2015]

Summary
-------
Influenza activity declined further in the northern hemisphere and was low in most regions globally. While influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominated this season in the northern hemisphere, the proportions of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and B viruses increased during the past few weeks.

- In North America, influenza activity continued to decrease. While influenza A(H3N2) had predominated this season, influenza B was the dominant virus during the recent weeks.

- In Europe, influenza activity continued to decrease in most countries. Influenza A(H3N2) predominated this season, but the proportion of influenza B detections was predominant in the last weeks.

- In northern Africa and the Middle East, influenza activity continued to decrease in most of the region. Influenza A viruses remained predominant in the region.

- In western Asia, influenza activity continued to decrease or remained low in most countries in the region, with a predominance of influenza A viruses. Influenza detections however remained high or possibly increased in Jordan and Turkey.

- In the temperate countries of Asia, influenza activity continued to decrease except in the Republic of Korea where activity remained high. Influenza A(H3N2) virus was predominant with an increase of influenza B virus detections in the Republic of Korea. In northern China influenza B virus remained predominant but detections decreased.

- In tropical countries of the Americas, influenza activity was low in most countries.

- In tropical Asia, influenza activity mainly due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses seemed to be declining in India. Influenza activity continued to decrease from its peak in southern China where influenza B virus was predominant, and in China Hong Kong Special Administrative Region where influenza A(H3N2) virus was the most frequently detected virus subtype.

- In tropical Africa, increased influenza activity was reported from western Africa with a mixture of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and B viruses circulating. Madagascar reported decreasing influenza activity after experiencing increased influenza activity from February [2015], with a peak at the beginning of March [2015], due to influenza A(H3N2) and B.

- In the southern hemisphere, influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels.

- The vaccine recommendation for the 2015-2016 northern hemisphere winter season was made in February 2015 and can be consulted at this link: http://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/recommendations/2015_16_north/en/.

- Based on FluNet reporting (as of 14 Apr 2015 12:35 UTC), National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 84 countries, areas or territories reported data for the time period from 22 Mar 2015 to 4 Apr 2015. The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 72 871 specimens. 12 009 were positive for influenza viruses, 4187 of which (34.9 per cent) were typed as influenza A and 7822 (65.1 per cent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 1281 (48.5 per cent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 1359 (51.5 per cent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 1441 (97 per cent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 44 (3 per cent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
North America
In North America, influenza activity continued to decline with some influenza indicators almost at the seasonal threshold. Influenza A(H3N2) dominated for most of this season except the last few weeks when influenza B predominated. However, the number of influenza B detections began to decrease slowly over the last few weeks.

In Canada, overall influenza detections slowly declined. The proportion of influenza B however was still increasing. Influenza B virus detections mainly affected individuals less than 65 years of age. Since the start of the season, individuals under 65 years accounted for 60 per cent of influenza B detections versus 41 per cent of influenza A(H3N2) detections. Influenza-like illness (ILI) activity was within the expected levels. In the United States of America, influenza activity continued to decline and at 1.8 per cent was for the 1st time below the 2.0 per cent national baseline since the season began. The influenza A detection rate continued to decrease and influenza B detections appeared to have peaked and were also declining. The proportion of influenza detections remained stable at 10.7 per cent compared with the previous report (10.6 per cent). The pneumonia and influenza mortality rate (6.5 per cent) reported through the 122 Cities Mortality Reporting System was below the epidemic threshold (7.1 per cent) for the week.

In Mexico, influenza detections overall decreased to 16.7 per cent positivity from 24.3 per cent in the previous report and the peak of around 50 per cent positivity at the end of 2014. Acute respiratory infection (ARI) activity continued to decrease to 397 ARI cases by 100 000 habitants from the last report (509 ARI cases by 100 000) and the peak (700 ARI cases per 100 000) at the end of January [2015]. Pneumonia activity continued to decrease but remained above the expected levels.

Europe
In Europe, influenza activity continued to decline in most reporting countries but the proportion of positive samples remained high at 36 per cent, above the threshold of 10 per cent. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominated this season. However, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 continued to circulate in the region and influenza B virus proportions remained elevated, accounting for 77 per cent of the sentinel detections during the most recent week. The excess all-cause mortality continued to decrease among reporting countries, according to the European project for monitoring excess mortality for public health action (EUROMOMO). The number of hospitalized influenza cases for the week also continued to decline following the peak in week 7.

In eastern Europe, overall influenza activity continued to decrease or remained low. Influenza A(H3N2) was predominant, followed by influenza B.

Northern Africa and Middle East
In northern Africa and the Middle East, influenza activity continued to decrease throughout most of the region. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was predominant.

Western Asia
In western Asia, influenza activity continued to decrease in most countries in the region. ILI rates and influenza detections remained high but seem to have peaked at the end of March [2015] in Turkey when influenza B was predominant. Jordan reported an increase in influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 detections since March. The Islamic Republic of Iran reported a continued decrease in influenza activity since
the peak at the end of February [2015] with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B viruses co-circulating.

Central Asia
In central Asia, some countries reported low influenza activity with co-circulation of influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses.

Eastern Asia
In eastern Asia, influenza activity continued to decrease in most of the region, but activity remained high in the Republic of Korea where the proportion of patient visits for ILI remained well over the baseline of 12.2 per cent, at 31.7 per cent. Here, influenza activity was due to an increasing proportion of influenza B detections and a diminishing proportion of influenza A(H3N2) detections. In northern China, there was a slight increase in percent positivity due to the rise in influenza B detections which accounted for 93.2 per cent of the total influenza detections. In Mongolia, the ILI rate and hospitalizations due to pneumonia decreased further and few influenza detections were reported.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
Tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean
Overall, countries in the Caribbean, Central America and the tropical countries of South America continued to experience low influenza activity, with influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B the most frequently detected viruses in countries with activity.

In the tropical countries of South America, Colombia reported decreasing influenza activity after some weeks of increased activity when influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and B were co-circulating during January and February 2015. A slight increase of influenza A(H3N2) was reported in Peru. RSV activity was high or increasing in Ecuador and Colombia.

Central African tropical region
In Africa, an increased number of influenza detections was reported over the last few weeks from western Africa: Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana reported a mixture of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and B virus detections, whereas Senegal detected predominately influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses.

Madagascar reported increased influenza activity since February 2015 with the proportion of ILI visits peaking around week 10. The influenza positivity rate over this period was 44.9 per cent, with influenza B accounting for 64.6 per cent (144/223) and influenza A(H3N2) for 35.4 per cent (79/223) of the detections. Among SARI samples, 35.8 per cent (44/123) tested positive for a respiratory virus: RSV was the most commonly detected virus (29/44; 65.9 per cent) followed by influenza B (17/44; 38.6 per cent) and influenza A (8/44; 18.2 per cent).

Tropical Asia
In tropical Asia, influenza activity seemed to be decreasing in India where influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 predominated. Bhutan has reported an increase in the number of ILI and SARI cases, with an increase in influenza A(H3N2) detections and decreasing number of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 detections among the ILI cases, while none of the SARI samples tested positive for influenza. Sri Lanka reported an increase in influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 detections.

Influenza activity continued to decrease from its peak in southern China, where influenza B was predominant. China Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) reported that influenza activity continued to decrease and is now close to the baseline, with influenza A(H3N2) predominant. ILI consultation rates have decreased from 5.7 to 4.8 cases per 1 000 consultations. Viet Nam reported sporadic influenza activity with co-circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B viruses.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
Influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels in most of the reporting countries in the southern hemisphere.
