Michigan total of West Nile virus infected crows reaches 8
----------------------------------------------------------
Last week, it was announced that West Nile virus had been detected in a
crow found in Royal Oak and a crow found in Clinton township. Public health
surveillance for the virus has detected no human cases of West Nile virus
infection in Michigan. Testing over the weekend identified West Nile virus
infection in 6 more crows, found in south east Michigan. The infected crows
were found in Southfield, Birmingham, northern Detroit in the proximity of
the state fairgrounds, Oak Park and 2 in Royal Oak. This brings the total
number of crows positive for the disease in Michigan to 8.
Residents who find a dead crow or blue jay have been told to contact their
local health officials or report them to the State's West Nile virus
toll-free hotline. Only black crow and blue jay specimens should be
submitted for testing and decomposed or mutilated birds should not be
submitted.
