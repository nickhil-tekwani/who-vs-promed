Public health authorities are investigating almost 3 dozen probable cases of _Escherichia coli_ infections in the Royal City [Guelph], the provincial Health Ministry said yesterday, 20 Apr 2015. "35 people are presenting symptoms," ministry spokesperson Andrew Morrison said.

These aren't confirmed incidents of the potentially dangerous _E. coli_ O157:H7 bacterium, which remains at 5 cases in Guelph, Morrison said. He added Guelph public health authorities knew about the 35 probable cases previously, but hadn't made that public until they realigned their definition of probable cases to match that of other health authorities in Ontario. Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health did so yesterday, 20 Apr 2015.

That brings Ontario's tally to 128 probable cases, 26 of which are confirmed. These include 2 confirmed cases out of 3 under investigation in Waterloo Region (at St Mary's high school in Kitchener). There are also 5 confirmed cases out of 29 probable cases in Halton Region and 14 confirmed cases out of 56 probable in Niagara Region.

Testing at the ministry's laboratory in Toronto has found the 4 _E. coli_ outbreaks have the same genetic fingerprints, suggesting a common source of contamination. The ministry and Canadian Food Inspection Agency are looking at food suppliers and distributors, but Morrison said a common link in the outbreaks hasn't been made. One possible source is contaminated lettuce, he said.

"That's certainly one of the things they're testing for," Morrison said, adding investigators are looking at any possible source of contamination in kitchen settings. We're not ruling anything out."

Late yesterday afternoon, 20 Apr 2015, public health in Guelph issued a release in which medical officer of health Dr Nicola Mercer said, "we are investigating romaine lettuce as the possible source." Public health advised washing lettuce, but warned that doesn't always get rid of all contamination.

Public health has expanded its investigation beyond Guelph to include Wellington and Dufferin counties.

The 5 confirmed local cases are University of Guelph students recovering from the illness, at least 1 of whom was hospitalized. At least 4 of these students ate at the Pita Pit in the University Centre food court. The university, which owns the franchise, has shut down the outlet while the _E. coli_ investigation continues.
