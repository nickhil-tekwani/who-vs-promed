In this reporting week 28 May - 3 Jun 2018:
- 69 suspected cases reported from 19 states from NCDC [Nigeria Center for Disease Control] Central Public Health Laboratory (CPHL) Lagos and Maitama District Hospital Laboratory
- No new in-country presumptive positives in the reporting week
- No new confirmed case from Dakar in the reporting week
- Last presumptive positive case in the Nigerian lab was 10 May [2018]
- Last IP Dakar confirmed case from Nigeria was on 15 May 2018.

Summary of Outbreak:
A yellow fever outbreak is currently active in Nigeria. Confirmed cases have been recorded in 10 states (Kwara, Kogi, Kano, Zamfara, Kebbi, Nasarawa, Niger, Katsina, Edo, and Ekiti) in 21 local government areas (LGAs).

126 samples (presumptive positive and inconclusive) in 57 LGAs sent to IP Dakar (Table 2)

All Nigerian states have reported suspected cases in 414 LGAs.

From the onset of this outbreak on 12 Sep 2017, a total of 1903 suspected yellow fever cases have been line-listed as of week 22 [28 May - 3 Jun 2018 (Table 1)].

Of the 1903 suspected cases, 1724 (90.6 percent), had blood samples collected and sent to the Nigerian testing laboratories for confirmation (Table 3).

Of the 1724 samples collected, 108 (6.3 percent) tested positive for yellow fever (presumptive positives) with 16 (0.9 percent) inconclusive results in 6 Nigerian laboratories. (Tables 2 and 3).

As of Epi week 22 [28 May - 3 Jun 2018), 46 (36.5 percent) samples out of the 126 (positive and inconclusive) samples in Nigeria have been confirmed positive by IP, Dakar. 73 samples were negative; 7 samples are awaiting results from IP Dakar [Table 1].

Predominant age groups affected are 20 years and below, accounting for 62.3 percent (See fig 3).
- Median age is 14 years (range 1-92 years)
- Male to female ratio is 1.4 to 1 (male 57.6 percent, female 42.4 percent):
- Among the confirmed, male to female ratio is 1.4:1 (male 63.0 percent, female 37.0 percent).

Yellow fever vaccination campaigns have been successfully completed in 6 states.
- 2013 Preventive mass vaccination campaign (PMVC) 2013 in Nasarawa, Cross River, Akwa Ibom;
- 2018 phase 1 PMVC in Kogi, Kwara and Zamfara and in 58 political wards in 25 LGAs in Borno State
- Reactive vaccination campaign conducted for affected and contiguous LGAs in Kebbi (8 LGAs), Niger (5 LGAs) and Sokoto (1 LGA)

Total number of deaths in all cases (suspected, probable and confirmed cases) is 47, while 10 deaths were recorded among confirmed cases only. Therefore, the case fatality ratio (CFR) for all cases (including suspected, probable and confirmed) is 2.5 percent, and 21.7 percent for confirmed cases.

[Although there were 69 suspected yellow fever (YF) cases in 19 states during the reporting week, none was presumptive nor were there any new laboratory confirmed cases. Nevertheless, the YF outbreak is still considered active in 10 states. In a 1 Jun 2018 ProMED-mail post (Yellow fever - Africa (08): Nigeria 20180602.5835487), it was stated that in early February 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it would immunise 1.2 million people against yellow fever (YF) in Borno state because of the large number of internally displace refugees living in camps in situations that place them at great risk of a YF outbreak. It had already vaccinated 2 million refugees there. The WHO was already working with the Federal government and other implementing partners to control spread of the disease in 16 states of the country in the past 5 months, including Abia, Anambra, Enugu, Kano, Katsina, Kogi, Kwara, Kebbi, Lagos, Nasarawa, Niger, Oyo, Plateau, and Zamfara, among others. The current effort is the start of the YF vaccination campaign that would run through 2018 and was aimed at vaccinating 25 million Nigerians in different parts of the country and would be the largest ever in Nigeria. This will be a logistically difficult but needed effort. Presumably, there is an adequate supply of the vaccine for the campaign. The recent YF outbreak in several states in Nigeria indicate that the virus is present, and the risk of a major outbreak is real. Vaccination is the most effective preventive measure available.
