J&J and Merck Ebola vaccines produce lasting antibodies in children and adults - studies
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ebola vaccines developed by Johnson & Johnson and Merck & Co produced virus-fighting antibodies and appear to be safe in children and adults, according to data from 2 studies published on Wednesday [14 Dec 2022].

Both companies' vaccines produced antibodies 14 days after the 1st of 2 shots and were detectable at varying levels in both children and adults for one year, data from the studies conducted in Western Africa showed.

The vaccines are designed to target the Zaire strain of the virus, not the Sudan strain of Ebola that recently caused an outbreak and at least 56 deaths in Uganda.

One regimen tested a dose of J&J's vaccine, followed by a booster shot of a vaccine from Danish drugmaker Bavarian Nordic, while another tested 2 doses of Merck's vaccine with 8 weeks in between. A 3rd option followed the 1st Merck dose with a placebo.

"I think the study shows that both the vaccines elicit good antibody responses," said Dr. H. Clifford Lane, one of the researchers and a clinical director at the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Only Merck's shot can potentially be given as a single dose while J&J's vaccine may need to continue as a 2-dose regimen, Lane added.

The NIH researchers noted that they were unable to assess the actual level of protection against the disease from the vaccines as no participants contracted Ebola during the trial, which began enrollment in 2017. But they said the vaccines were found to be safe for children and adults.

"Long-term follow up of the participants in this trial is taking place to determine if and when booster doses might be needed," said Brian Greenwood, a study co-author from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.

A total of 1400 adults and 1401 children aged 1 to 17 years old participated in the trials conducted in collaboration with Liberia Ministry of Health and with the University Clinical Research Center and the Center for Vaccine Development-Mali.

The results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

Merck's vaccine Ervebo was approved by the European regulator and prequalified by the World Health Organization in 2019. J&J's Zabdeno got European and WHO clearances in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Bavarian Nordic's Mvabea, used in the J&J regimen, also received European approval in 2020 and WHO prequalification in 2021.

Ebola outbreak in Uganda, as of 13 Dec 2022
-------------------------------------------
As of 13 Dec 2022, 142 confirmed cases of EVD caused by Sudan ebolavirus [SVD] including 55 deaths have been reported. An additional 22 probable cases died before samples were obtained for confirmation. There have been 87 recoveries among the confirmed cases. At least 19 healthcare workers have been infected and 7 died.

The districts currently affected are Jinja, Kampala, Kassanda, Mubende and Wakiso.

Bunyangabu, Kagadi, Kyegegwa and Masaka have completed 2 incubation cycles of the virus without reporting any cases, hence the districts have been removed from the list.

Overall, the current risk for citizens within the EU/EEA is considered very low, while the risk for EU/EEA citizens living or travelling in the affected areas in Uganda is considered low.

Currently there are 6 contacts actively being followed up in Kassanda.

The last reported case was a stillborn 32-week-old male delivered on 27 Nov 2022 to a woman who survived SVD late in her pregnancy. This case was confirmed after a period of 13 days with no confirmed cases.

As of 5 Dec 2022, there are 36 active contacts under follow up across 4 districts, with a follow up rate of 100%. A total of 4 754 contacts of cases have been identified across 15 districts.

Overall, there have been 9 Ugandan districts affected by this outbreak: Bunyangabu, Jinja, Kagadi, Kampala, Kassanda, Kyegegwa, Masaka, Mubende, and Wakiso. Bunyangabu, Kagadi, Kyegegwa and Masaka have completed 2 incubation cycles of the virus without reporting any cases.

Background
----------
On 20 Sep 2022, the Ministry of Health in Uganda, together with WHO AFRO, confirmed an outbreak of SVD in Mubende District, Uganda, after 1 fatal case was confirmed.

The index case was a 24-year-old man, a resident of Ngabano village of the Madudu sub-county in Mubende District. The patient experienced high fever, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and began vomiting blood on 11 Sep 2022. Samples were collected on 17 Sep 2022 and SVD was laboratory-confirmed on 19 Sep 2022. The patient died on the same day [19 Sep 2022], 5 days after hospitalisation.

On 15 Oct 2022, the President of Uganda imposed a 21-day lockdown on the Mubende and Kassanda districts to contain the outbreak. Measures included an overnight curfew, closing places of worship and entertainment, and restricting movement in and out of the 2 districts. These measures were extended on 5 Nov 2022 and again on 26 Nov 2022, until 17 Dec 2022.

The Ugandan government is carrying out community-based surveillance and active case finding. An on-site mobile laboratory has been established in Mubende and risk communication activities are ongoing in all affected districts. Africa CDC, WHO, GOARN and other partners have teams in Uganda to support the coordination of the response.

As of 16 Nov 2022, all travellers leaving or arriving at Entebbe International Airport in Uganda are required to complete a health declaration form.

On 8 Dec 2022, the Ministry of Health of Uganda announced that 1200 doses of vaccine have arrived in the country which will be used in the Tokomeza Ebola vaccine trial. This is the 1st batch of one of 3 vaccine candidates. According to the Sabin Vaccine Institute, the doses that have arrived are Sabin's vaccine and they will make another 8500 doses available to WHO on a rolling basis through January [2023].

SVD outbreaks have previously occurred in Uganda (4 outbreaks) and Sudan (3 outbreaks). The last SVD outbreak in Uganda was in 2012.

ECDC Assessment
---------------
Risk to EU/EEA citizens living in or travelling to affected areas in Uganda
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Despite the increase in number of cases and the transmissions reported in the densely populated capital city of Kampala, the current probability that EU/EEA citizens living in or travelling to EVD-affected areas of Uganda will be exposed to the virus is very low, provided that they adhere to the recommended precautionary measures (see further information below). Transmission requires direct contact with blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of dead or living infected people or animals; all unlikely exposures for the general EU/EEA tourists or expatriates in Uganda.

Considering that infection with Sudan ebolavirus leads to severe disease but that the probability of exposure of EU/EEA citizens is very low, the impact for the EU/EEA citizens living and travelling in affected areas in Uganda is considered low. Overall, the current risk for EU/EEA citizens living or travelling to affected areas in Uganda is considered low.

Risk of introduction and spread within the EU/EEA
-------------------------------------------------
The most likely route by which the Ebola virus could be introduced to the EU/EEA is through infected people from affected areas travelling to the EU/EEA or medical evacuation of cases to the EU/EEA. According to the International Air Travel Association, in 2019, there were about 126 000 travellers arriving in the EU/EEA from Uganda. Based on experience from the largest EVD outbreak in West Africa to date (2013-2016), where thousands of cases were reported, with transmission in large urban centres, and hundreds of EU/EEA humanitarian and military personnel deployed to the affected areas, importation of cases by travellers is considered unlikely.

The likelihood of secondary transmission of Ebola virus within the EU/EEA and the implementation of sustained chains of transmission within the EU/EEA is very low as cases are likely to be promptly identified and isolated and follow up control measures are likely to be implemented. During the large EVD outbreak in West Africa in 2013-2016, there was only one local transmission in the EU/EEA (in Spain) in a healthcare worker who had attended to an evacuated EVD patient. The impact for the EU/EEA citizens living in the EU/EEA is considered low and overall, the current risk for the citizens in the EU/EEA is considered very low.

Healthcare providers in the EU/EEA should be informed of and sensitized to:
• the possibility of EVD among travellers returning from affected areas;
• the clinical presentation of the disease and need to enquire about travel history and contacts in people returning from EVD-affected countries;
• the availability of protocols for the ascertainment of possible cases and procedures for referral to healthcare facilities;
• the imperative need for strict implementation of barrier management, use of personal protective measures and equipment and disinfection procedures in accordance with specific guidelines and WHO infection control recommendations when providing care to EVD cases.

Vaccines
--------
The licensed vaccines available, protect against EVD due to Zaire ebolavirus. There are no licensed vaccines against EVD due to Sudan ebolavirus, and there are no available data on the level of cross-protections. The availability of a vaccine was proven to be very helpful in the control of the recent outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The unavailability of vaccines will be an additional challenge in the control of this outbreak.
