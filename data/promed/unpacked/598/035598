Avian influenza in Denmark
Information received on 2 Jun 2006 from Dr Preben Willeberg, Chief
Veterinary Officer, Danish Veterinary and Food Administration, Soborg:
Report date: 2 Jun 2006.
Identification of agent: low pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5*.
Date of start of the event: 1 Jun 2006.
An outbreak of low pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5 has been
reported in a hatchery for farmed game birds (mallards), ducks and geese at
Tommerup in Funen county. There were approximately 19 750 mallards (day-old
to 5-weeks-old), 1200 [other] ducks (day-old to 2-weeks-old) and 1600 geese
(day-old to 5-weeks-old). There were also 6 adult geese and 14 adult ducks.
The diagnosis was made by the Danish Institute for Food and Veterinary
Research using PCR test and sequence analysis.
The holding is located within the already existing "area B" (covering Funen
county), which has been in place since 18 May 2006. The Danish Veterinary
and Food Administration is setting up a 1 km-radius restricted zone around
the holding and implementing the necessary measures in accordance with
European Union directive 2005/94/EC.
* Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: H5 and H7 avian
influenza in its low pathogenic form in poultry is a notifiable disease as
per Chapter 2.7.12. on avian influenza of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code.

[It is helpful that countries are reporting low pathogenic versions of the
H5 avian influenza virus, as tracking the many strains of this virus is the
best way to ensure a complete epidemiologic picture. The UK has also
recently reported a low pathogenic H7N3 virus and appears to be successful
in controlling it. Low pathogenic strains can cause human disease
occasionally -- most commonly conjunctivitis -- but have never been
associated as a cause of human mortality. However, a highly pathogenic H7N7
virus did cause the death of a previously health Dutch veterinarian working
to control the 2003 outbreak in the Netherlands. - Mod.PC]
