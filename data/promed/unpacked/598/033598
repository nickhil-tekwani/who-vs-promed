SARS-CoV-2 Variant Classifications and Definitions
--------------------------------------------------

Key Points
----------
Genetic lineages of SARS-CoV-2 have been emerging and circulating around the world since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

SARS-CoV-2 genetic lineages in the United States are routinely monitored through epidemiological investigations, virus genetic sequence-based surveillance, and laboratory studies.

The US government SARS-CoV-2 Interagency Group (SIG) added a new class of SARS-CoV-2 variants designated as Variants Being Monitored.

This class includes variants with substitutions of concern, including previously designated Variants of Interest (VOIs) or Variants of Concern (VOCs), that are no longer detected or are circulating at very low levels in the United States, and as such, do not pose a significant or imminent risk to public health in the United States.

The SIG Variant classification scheme defines 4 classes of SARS-CoV-2 variants:

Variant Being Monitored (VBM): alpha (B.1.1.7, Q.1-Q.8), beta (B.1.351, B.1.351.2, B.1.351.3), gamma (P.1, P.1.1, P.1.2), epsilon (B.1.427 and B.1.429), eta (B.1.525), iota (B.1.526), kappa (B.1.617.1), B.1.617.3, mu (B.1.621, B.1.621.1), zeta (P.2)

Variant of Interest (VOI)
Variant of Concern (VOC):Delta (B.1.617.2 and AY.1 sublineages)
Variant of High Consequence (VOHC)

Alpha (B.1.1.7, Q.1-Q.8), beta (B.1.351, B.1.351.2, B.1.351.3), and gamma (P.1, P.1.1, P.1.2) have been downgraded from Variants of Concern to Variants Being Monitored based on significant and sustained reduction in national and regional proportions.

Eta (B.1.525), iota (B.1.526), kappa (B.1.617.1), and B.1.617.3 have been downgraded from Variants of Interest to Variants Being Monitored based on significant and sustained reduction in national and regional proportions.

Additional Variants Being Monitored include epsilon (B.1.427 and B.1.429) and Zeta (P.2) based on their previous classification as Variants of Concern or Variants of Interest.

To date [Thu 23 Sep 2021], no variants of high consequence have been identified in the United States.

Due to the increasing number of sublineages that are associated with alpha, delta, and gamma, unless otherwise specified, CDC will refer to the sublineages collectively as Q sublineages (alpha), AY sublineages (delta) and P.1 sublineages (gamma).

Vaccines approved and authorized for use in the United States are effective against these variants and effective therapeutics are available. CDC continues to monitor all variants circulating within the United States.

CDC will no longer provide unweighted proportions of substitutions of concern for SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody therapies. Clinicians seeking advice on the use of monoclonal antibody products authorized for emergency use in the United States for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 should consult the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines external icon and the FDA Fact Sheets for Health Care Providers for the three anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody treatments with FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the treatment of COVID-19: bamlanivimab plus etesevimabexternal; casirivimab plus imdevimabexternal; sotrovimabexternal.

Viruses like SARS-CoV-2 continuously evolve as mistakes (genetic mutations) occur during replication of the genome. A lineage is a genetically closely related group of virus variants derived from a common ancestor. A variant has one or more mutations that differentiate it from other variants of the SARS-CoV-2 viruses. As expected, multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been documented in the United States and globally throughout this pandemic. To inform local outbreak investigations and understand national trends, scientists compare genetic differences between viruses to identify variants and how they are related to each other.

How Variants Are Classified
----------------------------
The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) established a SARS-CoV-2 Interagency Group (SIG) to improve coordination among the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), and Department of Defense (DoD). This interagency group is focused on the rapid characterization of emerging variants and actively monitors their potential impact on critical SARS-CoV-2 countermeasures, including vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.

The SIG meets regularly to evaluate the risk posed by SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in the United States and to make recommendations about the classification of variants. This evaluation is undertaken by a group of subject matter experts who assess available data, including variant proportions at the national and regional levels and the potential or known impact of the constellation of mutations on the effectiveness of medical countermeasures, severity of disease, and ability to spread from person to person. Given the continuousâ€¯evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and our understanding of the impact of variants on public health, variants may be reclassified based on their attributes and prevalence in the United States.

- Variants Being Monitored (VBM) - View current VBM in the United States that continue to be monitored and characterized by federal agencies
- Variant of Interest (VOI) - Currently, there are no SARS-CoV-2 variants that are designated as Variants of Interest
- Variant of Concern (VOC) - View current VOC in the United States that are being closely monitored and characterized by federal agencies
- Variant of High Consequence (VOHC) - Currently there are no SARS-CoV-2 variants that rise to the level of high consequence

Notes: Each variant classification includes the possible attributes of lower classes (e.g., VOC includes the possible attributes of VOI); variant status might escalate or deescalate based on emerging scientific evidence. This page will be updated as needed to show the variants that belong to each class. The World Health Organization (WHO) also classifies variant viruses as Variants of Concern and Variants of Interest; US classifications may differ from those of WHO because the impact of variants may differ by location. To assist with public discussions of variants, WHO proposed using labels consisting of the Greek Alphabet, e.g., alpha, beta, gamma, as a practical way to discuss variants by non-scientific audiences. The labels assigned to each variant are provided in the tables below. ...-more

[2] Novavax
Date: Thu 23 Sep 2021 11:55 AM EDT
Source: Reuters [edited]
https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/novavax-applies-who-emergency-listing-covid-19-vaccine-2021-09-23/


Novavax Inc (NVAX.O) and its partner Serum Institute of India have applied to the World Health Organization for an emergency use listing of Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine, potentially clearing the way for the shot to ship to many poorer countries, the company said on [Thu 23 Sep 2021].

Novavax has been prioritizing regulatory submissions to low- and middle-income countries after falling behind in the race for authorization in the United States and Europe, which have already vaccinated most of their residents.

A WHO listing would allow Novavax to ship to multiple developing nations that rely on WHO guidance for their regulatory decisions.

It would also allow Novavax to begin distributing shots through the COVAX facility, which aims to provide equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for low- and middle-income countries.

Novavax has already submitted regulatory documents to countries including India, the Philippines and Indonesia.

Novavax shares were up more than 10% in morning trading following the announcement.

Novavax and India's Serum Institute, the world's largest vaccine producer, have together committed to providing more than 1.1 billion doses to the COVAX facility. COVAX has distributed fewer than 300 million shots to poorer nations, a fraction of the roughly 6 billion shots experts say are needed.

The United States earlier this week said it was committing an additional 500 million vaccines made by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) to COVAX, bringing its total contribution to more than 1 billion shots. read more

Novavax had previously said it would apply for WHO authorization in August [2021], marking a slight delay in the filing. It expects to file for regulatory authorization in the United States and European Union in the 4th quarter of 2021.

Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine production ramp-up has been fraught with delays and it is unclear how many Novavax shots will be available for the COVAX facility this year [2021]. Novavax said in August [2021] it was aiming to produce 100 million shots monthly by the end of the 3rd quarter.

The Novavax shot is a protein-based vaccine, and was shown to be more than 90% effective, including against a variety of concerning variants of the coronavirus in a large, late-stage U.S.-based clinical trial.

Early studies suggest Novavax is effective at protecting against the contagious delta variant of COVID-19, which has become dominant in many countries, distributing shots through the COVAX facility, which aims to provide equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for low- and middle-income countries.

[3] WHO: monoclonal antibody
Date: Sat 25 Sep 2021
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/09/who-adds-new-recommendation-covid-19-monoclonal-antibody-combo


The World Health Organization (WHO) today recommended another treatment for COVID-19, a monoclonal antibody combination from Regeneron already in use in the United States, though it urged companies and governments to make sure it's accessible to lower- and middle-income countries.

Supply, drug administration challenges
--------------------------------------
The WHO's conditional recommendation for the monoclonal antibody cocktail, which consists of casirimivab and imdevimab, applies to patients with nonsevere COVID-19 who are at high risk for hospitalization and for people who have severe and critical infections who have no antibodies to SARS-COV-2.

In November [2020], the US Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization for the drug combination for adults and kids ages 12 and older who have mild- to moderate COVID-19. The combination is administered through intravenous (IV) infusion or injection. It made headlines when it was used to treat former President Donald Trump's COVID-19 infection.

Demand for the treatment has been skyrocketing in US hot spots such as Florida, where officials have opened state-run centers to deliver the treatment. As a result, the Biden administration recently took steps to address shortages by taking over distribution and buying 1.4 million more doses. In the United States, the drug costs about USD 1250 per dose and is covered by the federal government.

In a statement, the WHO said it welcomed the new treatment recommendation, but raised concerns about the high price and limited production, as well as safe and appropriate handling of the medicine.

It said UNITAID, a global health group, is negotiating with Roche to make the drug for a lower price and for equitable distribution to include lower- and middle-income countries. The WHO said it is also in talks with the company about donations that would be distributed through UNICEF.

Also, the WHO warned of possible challenges in rolling out the new antibody treatment, typically given by IV. In outpatient settings, injection administration at the lowest dose may be an option.

To support equitable treatment, the WHO suggested reserving doses for those known to benefit most from it: those without severe illness who are at high hospitalization risk and those with severe illness who don't have antibodies, based on assessment with rapid tests.

- The nongovernmental health organization Oxfam said this week (w/e 24 Sep 2021) that Yemen is battling a 3rd surge of COVID-19 activity, with cases recently tripling and deaths rising more than fivefold. It added that less than 1% of the country's population has received one vaccine dose and that COVAX has delivered only 511 000 of the promised 4.2 million doses. More than 4 million people have been displaced due to conflict, resulting in a humanitarian crisis that, along with COVID-19, further weakens Yemen's fragile health system.

Children under 12 are already the population group with the highest case index of COVID-19, since this week they have been at the head of the positive ranking and are the only ones with a rate higher than 100 contagion for every 100 000 inhabitants. All others are right on that barrier or below it.

[C] COVID-19 (323) - Global: moderate decrease in cases, WHO
Date: Wed 22 Sep 2021
Source: The Denver Channel [edited]
https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/national/coronavirus/world-health-organization-reports-global-decline-in-new-covid-19-cases


The number of new COVID-19 cases continued to fall last week, with 3.6 million new cases reported globally, down from 4 million new infections the previous week, the World Health Organization said.

Last week's drop marked the first substantial decline for more than 2 months, with falling COVID-19 cases in every world region.

In its latest update on the pandemic released on [Tue 21 Sep 2021], the WHO said there were major decreases in cases in 2 regions: a 22% fall in the Middle East and a 16% drop in Southeast Asia.

The U.N. health agency said there were just under 60 000 deaths in the past week, a 7% decline. It said that while Southeast Asia reported a 30% decrease in COVID-19 deaths, the Western Pacific region reported a 7% increase.

The most new coronavirus cases were seen in the U.S., India, Britain, Turkey and the Philippines.

In the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that the 7-day average of new daily cases dropped slightly from an average of 141 000 to about 131 000 between [13 Sep and 20 Sep 2021] -- an indication that the current surge may have peaked. However, daily deaths increased from an average of 1300 a day to 1500 a day during that same timespan.

WHO said the faster-spreading delta variant has now been seen in 185 countries and is present in every part of the world.

The organization also revised its list of "variants of interest," or those that it believes have the potential to cause big outbreaks; WHO said it's tracking the lambda and mu variants, which both arose in Latin America but have yet to cause widespread epidemics.

WHO has previously said that in all countries where the delta variant is circulating, it has become the predominant virus.
