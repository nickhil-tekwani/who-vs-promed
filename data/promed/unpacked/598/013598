In less than a week, 23 La Plata [Buenos Aires province] dolphins were found dead, washed off the coast of Buenos Aires province. According to specialists, all of them had marks of fishing nets on their mouths. The dead dolphins were found in different coastal localities, namely Mar de Ajó, La Lucila, Aguas Verdes, Santa Teresita, Las Toninas, and San Clemente del Tuyú.

The biologist Sergio Morón, from Mundo Marino foundation, revealed that "many of them had marks on their skin that might be related to fishing nets." However, he added, "artisanal fishing does not cause consequences of such magnitude. Many fishermen call us every time they find a wounded animal, mostly turtles, and this way they aid in the rescue efforts".

The La Plata dolphin is considered a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature [IUCN].

[The La Plata dolphin (_Pontoporia blainvillei_) is found in the coastal Atlantic waters of southeastern South America, including the Río de la Plata estuary. Its distribution ranges from the Tropic of Capricorn near Ubatuba, Brazil, south to Península Valdés, Argentina. It is the only member of the river dolphin group that actually lives in the ocean and saltwater estuaries, rather than freshwater.

La Plata dolphins are bottom feeders and the main items they eat are fish, octopus, squid, and shrimp. The La Plata dolphin is listed as "vulnerable" in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is of particular conservation concern because of its restricted distribution and vulnerability to incidental capture in fishing gear.

For a picture of one of the dead dolphins found in this episode go to http://www.ellitoral.com/slide/um.php/126925/.

It would be of interest to know if postmortem exams were conducted.

We await test results that shed some light on these mortalities. - Mod.PMB]
