Blue-ear pig disease under control
----------------------------------
Blue-ear pig disease has been kept under control with only 2 fresh
outbreaks detected on 2 May 2008. However, the Veterinary Department
has warned that the epidemic could spread further as the warm weather
creates ideal conditions for the virus to thrive.

Fresh outbreaks were detected on 2 May in 2 communes in northern Nam
Dinh and central Nghe An provinces. Elsewhere around the country,
1143 more pigs were infected with the virus and 1234 infected pigs were culled.

Currently, 10 provinces namely Ha Tinh, Quang Nam, Thanh Hoa, Nghe
An, Lam Dong, Thua Thien-Hue, Thai Binh, Thai Nguyen, Nam Dinh and
Ninh Binh have not passed the 21-day threshold to declare themselves
free from the disease.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) has asked
the world organisation for animal health (OIE) and China's general
department of animal health to send their experts to Viet Nam in May
to help the country stamp out the epidemic effectively. The ministry
has also signed a contract with China to import 1 million doses of
blue-ear vaccine.

The ministry has also asked all localities to keep a close watch on
the transportation, slaughtering and trading of pig products.

MARD will host a blue-ear pig disease conference in HCM City on 8 May 2008.

[On 23 Feb 2008, Southe Korea sent to the OIE its follow-up report
No.4 on the PRRS epizootic, stating that no new cases have been
recorded since follow-up report No.3 (submitted 3 Oct 2007).
Consequently, the 4th follow-up report was considered a "final
report." The "event summary," available -- with a map -- at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=5199>,
reports 53 outbreaks between 12 Mar 2007 and 17 Sep 2007 (the latter
date considered in WAHID interface as the date of the epizootic being
"resolved").

The current information, however, means that the epizootic has been
continuing (thus not resolved), or that it has been renewed. An
official notification to the OIE will help clarifying the situation. - Mod.AS]
