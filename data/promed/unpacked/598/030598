147 fall victim to CCHF over past 6 years in Turkey
---------------------------------------------------
Last year [2007], 55 people in Turkey died from Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), a viral disease carried by certain tick
species. With the latest deadly incidents, the total number of CCHF
deaths has risen to 147 for the past 6 years in the country,
according to research conducted by the Turkish Health Care Workers'
Union.

The study also mapped the fatalities caused by CCHF in Turkey. CCHF
was responsible for deaths in 24 provinces of Turkey last year
[2007], with the highest number of deaths occurring in the northern
province of Corum, where 9 people died. In the province of Karabuk 7
people died, and in Tokat province 5 people fell victim to the fatal
virus. A total of 4 people lost their lives to the virus in Sivas
last year [2007].

In addition, the study revealed that in 2007, the disease struck only
in the 5-month period between May and September, when temperatures
were high -- mostly occurring in June, which recorded 18 deaths. In
May 15 people died and in July 16; 4 died in August and 2 in
September.

Those over 55 were the demographic [group] with the most deaths from
ticks carrying the CCHF virus last year [2007]. According to the
research, 8 people aged below 30, 15 people aged 30-55, and 27 people
above the age of 55 died from CCHF. While the youngest person dying
from the disease was 12 years old, the oldest was 84.

Speaking about the results of the study, Onder Kahveci, the chairman
of the Turkish Healthcare Workers Union, said: "The number of CCHF
casualties is increasing every year. In large hospitals in the places
where incidents mostly occur, units for tick-borne disease must be
formed and the hospital staff must be properly educated about the
disease. In this way, a more effective struggle against the disease
can be achieved and problems, such as [the exposure] of health staff,
can be prevented."

[As of 30 Jun 2008, 688 confirmed cases have been reported -- see
ProMED ref. (14) below. The reason for the increasing incidence of
CCHF in Turkey is unclear. In view of the increase with age, it would
be interesting to know the occupations of the CCHF patients and the
proportion engaged in agricultural occupations as opposed to leisure
activities.
