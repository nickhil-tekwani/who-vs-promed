A 59-year-old female patient was confirmed with a hantavirus [infection] in the province of Herrera after presenting symptoms consistent with cardiopulmonary syndrome due to the disease.

The patient is a resident of El Pedernal, Parita district, and is hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit of the Dr Gustavo Nelson Collado Hospital in Chitré with assisted mechanical ventilation and is in critical condition.

The Epidemiology and Vector Control sections of the Herrera Health Region carried out an inspection of the surroundings of the house, finding multiple risk factors that favor the presence of the hantavirus-transmitting rodent.

The patient, according to the field investigation, has not traveled outside the district of Parita in the last 15 days, so the inspections focused on the surroundings of the house, where corn crops were found nearby, storehouses with grain stored in tanks, tubs, and on the ground; bags with rice husks and remains of garbage and scrap metal.

The authorities recommended that the people there carry out ventilation of closed areas for 30 minutes, spray the ground and surfaces with water and bleach, store the grain sealed hermetically, avoid depositing food scraps and garbage in the patios, and cover any hole that serves as a refuge for the mouse that transmits the virus.

[Herrera province reported cases of hantavirus infections earlier this year (see Hantavirus - Americas (30): Panama (LS) 20221012.8706113). The virus is endemic in the province and cases are reported there frequently. Although the above and the previous reports do not indicate which hantavirus is responsible for these cases, an earlier WHO report indicates that based on genomic sequence analysis, Choclo is the hantavirus identified in those previous cases (see Hantavirus - Americas (02): Panama WHO 2018 review 20190106.6245148). Curiously, Choclo virus is never mentioned in the popular press reports that come to ProMED from Panama, including this one. It is reassuring to know that the virus responsible for the cases described in the WHO report mentioned above -- or at least the ones for which samples and diagnostic testing were done -- was Choclo virus, which confirms the ProMED conclusion.

Earlier, Dr Jan Clement suggested that Seoul hantavirus might be involved in some of the cases in the Americas, including Panama. The rodent reservoir of Seoul virus is the ubiquitous brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_). Presumably, genomic analysis by the Gorgas Lab would have detected this virus. Nonetheless, diagnostic laboratories should be aware of this possibility and look for it.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be seen at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents live in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces, and saliva, the source of human infection. - Mod.TY
