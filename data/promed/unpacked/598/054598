The man was a battle-hardened cameraman who had cheated death in Iraq and walked among the ruins of quake-ravaged Nepal. He could not have possibly thought his end would come from filming a cookery program in his home country of Malaysia. "War assignments were his favorite. He was never afraid," said his widow, sitting in front of their wedding photographs in a middle-class, residential area of the capital, Kuala Lumpur.

While on his domestic cooking assignment last May 2017, he helped colleagues to pull a root out of the ground. Perhaps it was through a scratch on his hand or maybe he inhaled some particles of earth, but somehow the bacterium [_Burkholderia pseudomallei_] that causes melioidosis, also known as Whitmore's disease, invaded the 40-year-old cameraman's body. "When he came back, he was normal for days," his widow recalled. "Then my sister suddenly called me at work to say that he was vomiting and had a high fever, and was walking around the house like a zombie. When I came back home, he couldn't even stand up, and he was ranting and raving." As another family member tried lifting him, his widow noticed he'd lost an astonishing amount of weight. They called paramedics to rush him to the hospital.

Endemic but not exclusive to Malaysia, melioidosis typically affects farmers and construction builders. The disease's agent typically lives under about a foot of soil or in contaminated water. Nicknamed the "great mimicker," melioidosis has no specific symptoms and can easily be confused with other endemic illnesses such as dengue or leptospirosis, which also cause pneumonia, high fever, headache and muscle tenderness, as well as confusion and loss of weight, as was the case for this man.

"When a patient has these symptoms, most doctors in Malaysia would take it for dengue and tell the patient to go home and wait," explained Dr. Shih Keng Loong who works on melioidosis at the Tropical Infectious Diseases Research & Education Centre (TIDREC), part of the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur. "Instead, identifying the illness as soon as possible is crucial, especially as the right kind of antibiotic needs to be used," said Dr. Lee Hai-Yen, also at TIDREC. She cited meropenem, a broad-spectrum antibacterial used against a wide variety of severe infections, as the medicine of choice.

The unusual, life-threatening disease is believed to be a growing problem in Malaysia, and in the past, it has been carried to other countries, including the USA. Experts fear it could spread, but cases are so underreported that getting a head start on the problem is difficult.

Its actual prevalence is unknown. In Malaysia, for example, it is not mandatory to notify the authorities of cases. A recent study estimated that 160 000 people are infected each year around the world, and about half of them die. Malaysia has the world's highest percentage of officially reported cases, along with Thailand and Singapore, where medical facilities are more developed than in other Asian countries.

The majority of recorded cases in Malaysia occur in the east of the country in areas such as the rural state of Pahang, near Kuala Lumpur. Strict guidelines for doctors were adopted in Pahang after the search for a drowning victim in 2010 resulted in 8 fatalities. Victims fell ill with a rare co-infection of melioidosis and leptospirosis; the latter is also spread through water and soil, but when contaminated with rat urine.

The danger emanating from soil is expressly reflected in Malay folklore. The saying "dibawah pokok ada hantu" literally means "Under the tree, you'll find ghosts," while parents warn their children not to walk beneath trees without shoes or "somebody will steal them. People don't know why they get ill, but they come up with these sayings," Lee said.

Melioidosis affects animals -- especially farm animals -- and humans, but cases of infection from animals to humans are not known. Transmission between humans, including from mother to child, is rare but possible. The incubation period usually ranges from one day to 2 weeks, and while the infection can remain localized, the chances of dying or of internal organs becoming damaged increase significantly once it enters the bloodstream. This can lead to organ failure and septicemia, which happens in 90 percent of cases in Malaysia versus 46 percent of cases in Australia, where early detection is more advanced.

Sufferers in Malaysia are also at a statistically higher risk of death, since a staggering 17 percent of the population has diabetes, which alters immune functions and can make patients less able to fight off the deadly bacterium. "We didn't know he had diabetes. We discovered it in hospital, just before he died," said his wife of 10 years. Men are most affected, accounting for 79 percent of cases in hospitals in the northeast of the country, perhaps due to working more in agriculture and construction jobs. People living in endemic areas, however, are believed to have higher immune protection than others, such as tourists, as small doses might have been inhaled over the years.

However, this death shows how new factors mean that a wider segment of the population -- many of whom may have never heard of the disease -- are more likely to be exposed to the bacterium. More people in Malaysia are spending their leisure time in rural areas, enjoying outdoor pursuits such as hiking or camping. TIDREC Director Dr. Sazaly Abu Bakar believes that changing environments can further exposure. As palm oil plantations promote deforestation, he explained, more people enter previously untouched territory, exposing workers to contaminated elements.

The bacterium that causes melioidosis, which was 1st identified in 1912 among morphine addicts with a debilitated immune system in Myanmar, is extremely strong and can survive for up to 6 years in dry soil. Even more striking is the organism's resistance inside the human body, where it can exist for up to 60 years before becoming symptomatic. This happened to American soldiers who fought in Viet Nam and brought the bacterium -- since labeled "the Vietnamese time bomb" -- back home with them.

Furthermore, the lack of a vaccine, the bacterium's resistance to several categories of antimicrobials, and the ease with which it can be spread through air, soil and water all mean that melioidosis is considered by the U.S. CDC as a possible source for biological weapons. Use of a similar bacterium [_Burkholderia mallei_ - Mod.LL] was attempted during the First World War by German secret agents to debilitate horses and livestock in the USA, Romania, Spain, Norway and Argentina. The Soviet Union is also reported to have produced the bacterium in the 1980s.

[Melioidosis is a disease of the rainy season in its endemic areas. It mainly affects people who have direct contact with soil and water. Many have an underlying predisposing condition such as diabetes (commonest risk factor), renal disease, cirrhosis, thalassemia, alcohol dependence, immunosuppressive therapy, chronic obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and excess kava consumption. Kava is an herbal member of the pepper family that can be associated with chronic liver disease.

Melioidosis may present at any age, but peaks in the 4th and 5th decades of life, affecting men more than women. In addition, although severe fulminating infection can and does occur in healthy individuals, severe disease and fatalities are much less common in those without risk factors.

The most commonly recognized presentation of melioidosis is pneumonia, associated with high fever, significant muscle aches, chest pain, and -- although the cough can be nonproductive -- respiratory secretions can be purulent, significant in quantity, and associated with on-and-off bright, red blood. The lung infection can be rapidly fatal -- with bacteremia and shock -- or somewhat more indolent.

Acute melioidosis septicemia is the most severe complication of the infection. It presents as a typical sepsis syndrome with hypotension, high cardiac output, and low systemic vascular resistance. In many cases, a primary focus in the soft tissues or lung can be found. The syndrome, usually in patients with risk factor comorbidities, is characteristically associated with multiple abscesses involving the cutaneous tissues, the lung, the liver, and spleen, and a very high mortality rate of 80 to 95 percent. With prompt optimal therapy, the case fatality rate can be decreased to 40 to 50 percent.

The melioidosis bacillus is intrinsically insensitive to many antimicrobials. It should be noted that bioterrorism strains may be engineered to be even more resistant. _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ is usually inhibited by tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), antipseudomonal penicillins, carbapenems, ceftazidime, and amoxicillin/clavulanate or ampicillin/sulbactam. Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime have good in vitro activity but poor efficacy; and cefepime did not appear, as well, to be equivalent to ceftazidime in a mouse model. The unusual antimicrobial profile of resistance to colistin and polymyxin B and the aminoglycosides but sensitivity to amoxicillin/clavulanate is a useful tool to consider in treatment of infection with the organism.

The randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing melioidosis treatment have been reviewed, and it was found that the formerly standard therapy of chloramphenicol, doxycycline, and SXT combination had a higher mortality rate than therapy with ceftazidime, imipenem/cilastatin, or amoxicillin/clavulanate (or ampicillin/sulbactam). The betalactam-betalactamase inhibitor therapy, however, seemed to have a higher failure rate.
