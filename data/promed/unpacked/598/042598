At least 14 cases of _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ infection have been
identified in Oregon during the past few days. Most report eating raw
oysters at restaurants in Portland or Medford. One ate oysters that were
privately harvested in Washington State. In the past week, more than 15
cases have also been reported among residents of Washington and British
Columbia.

All are linked to raw oyster consumption, according to Paul Cieslak, M.D.,
communicable disease manager in the Oregon Department of Human Services
Public Health Division.

"These most recent cases are a reminder that uncooked shellfish are a
recurrent source of illness in the Pacific Northwest," said Cieslak, "It's
the same story as with meat and poultry; if you eat it raw or undercooked,
there is a real risk of getting sick with some pretty nasty bugs."

_Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ is a bacterium that is naturally present in many
marine waters, including those of the Pacific Coast. Sporadic cases and
occasional outbreaks associated with raw oyster consumption are reported
every year, and almost all reported cases have a history of eating raw
oysters within the day or 2 before illness onset, Cieslak said.

The symptoms of _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ infection include watery
diarrhea, cramps, vomiting and fever. Most cases resolve without treatment.
Cieslak advises that anyone sick enough to need medical attention for these
symptoms should tell their doctor whether they ate raw oysters or other
shellfish. Public health officials are currently working to identify the
harvest sites for the oysters involved in this most recent outbreak,
Cieslak said.

[It is important to stress that _V. parahaemolyticus_ is naturally present
in marine waters and does not imply sewage contamination, as would be the
case with _Salmonella sp._ or _E. coli_. It is most common in warmer waters
such as those of the American Gulf Coast, but warmer waters in more
northern climates can also be associated with oyster-associated _Vibrio
parahaemolyticus_.

In 2005, a New England Journal report highlighted this infection linked to
Alaskan oysters:

McLaughlin, JB, DePaola A, Bopp CA, et al: Outbreak of Vibrio
parahaemolyticus Gastroenteritis Associated with Alaskan Oysters. N Engl J
Med 2005;353:1463-70.

"Abstract: Background: _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_, the leading cause of
seafood-associated gastroenteritis in the USA, typically is associated with
the consumption of raw oysters gathered from warm water estuaries. We
describe a recognized outbreak of _V. parahaemolyticus_ infection
associated with the consumption of seafood from Alaska.

Methods: After we received reports of the occurrence of gastroenteritis on
a cruise ship, we conducted a retrospective cohort study among passengers,
as well as active surveillance throughout Alaska to identify additional
cases, and an environmental study to identify sources of _V.
parahaemolyticus_ and contributors to the outbreak.

Results: Of 189 passengers, 132 (70 percent) were interviewed; 22 of the
interviewees (17 percent) met our case definition of gastroenteritis. In
our multiple logistic-regression analysis, consumption of raw oysters was
the only significant predictor of illness; the attack rate among people who
consumed oysters was 29 percent. Active surveillance identified a total of
62 patients with gastroenteritis. _V. parahaemolyticus_ serotype O6:K18 was
isolated from the majority of patients tested and from environmental
samples of oysters. Patterns on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis were
highly related across clinical and oyster isolates. All oysters associated
with the outbreak were harvested when mean daily water temperatures
exceeded 15.0 degrees C (the theorized threshold for the risk of _V.
parahaemolyticus_ illness from the consumption of raw oysters). Since 1997,
mean water temperatures in July and August at the implicated oyster farm
increased 0.21 degrees C per year (P less than 0.001 by linear regression);
2004 was the only year during which mean daily temperatures in July and
August 2004 at the shellfish farm did not drop below 15.0 degrees C.

Conclusions: This investigation extends by 1000 km the northernmost
documented source of oysters that caused illness due to _V.
parahaemolyticus_. Rising temperatures of ocean water seem to have
contributed to one of the largest known outbreaks of _V. parahaemolyticus_
in the USA."

In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, cases of wound infection due to _V.
parahaemolyticus_ occurred. - Mod.LL]
