Lumpy skin disease (LSD) of cattle, locally known as "Go-Basant" [see comment], has triggered panic among people of Nischintakoili, Salepur, Mahanga, and Cuttack Sadar blocks. Over 2000 cattle have been affected in the 4 blocks. The highly infectious viral disease was 1st noticed in bordering areas of Nischintakoili block about a fortnight back and had affected some cows of farmers. Later it spread to other parts of the district.

The disease, characterised by appearance of skin nodules, has led to substantial production losses for the cattle farming industry due to a drop in milk yield, decreased fertility in cows and bulls, abortion, damaged skin and hides, decrease or increase in weight, and untimely death. "While anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory pain killer can be used to lower the fever and keep the domestic animal up, antibiotics can be used to prevent secondary bacterial infections," said a senior veterinary surgeon.

The affected dairy farmers alleged that nothing was being done by veterinary officials to check the disease from spreading, though the outbreak was noticed about 15 days back. "Several villagers depend upon dairy farming and earn their livelihood by selling milk, cheese, and curd," said secretary of Nischintakoili Block Milk Producers' Association Subhasis Basantaray, adding that the antibiotics were also not responding [sic].

Admitting the outbreak of LSD, chief district veterinary officer Cuttack Keshab Chandra Pradhan said an emergency meeting of block veterinary officers (BVOs) has been convened on Tuesday [20 Aug 2019] to take stock of the situation. Meanwhile, fearing the spread of the diseases from northern Odisha to the coastal belt, the directorate of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services, Odisha, has issued advice on prevention and control of lumpy skin disease.

[Lumpy skin disease [LSD], an OIE-notifiable capripox-virus disease of cattle, which has been spreading during recent years in the Middle East, south east Europe, and western Asia, including Russia, has "never been reported" in India (2018 OIE annual report). The information about such an exotic disease having already obtained a local, vernacular name ("Go-Basant") is rather puzzling.

As can be seen in OIE's global LSD map for the period 2005-2019, not a single of all India's neighbors is known to have ever reported LSD; India is at least 2000 km [1243 mi] distant from the closest infected territory, globally (map at https://tinyurl.com/y28wazxv).

Further information on the above event, and its confirmation as LSD or otherwise, is requested. - Mod.AS
