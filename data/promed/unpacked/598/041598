Epidemiological comments:
Three dead wild ferret-badgers which were found in Nantou County in May 2012 and December 2012, and Yunlin County in November 2012, were detected by RT-PCR as suspicious rabies cases by National Taiwan University on 17 Jun 2013. Before the detection, National Taiwan University conducted a series of tests including necropsy, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and RT-PCR for 6 months and ruled out the possibility of canine distemper and pseudo rabies. National Taiwan University then conducted RT-PCR of rabies in June 2013, and had the 1st positive result reported on 24 Jun 2013. The samples were sent to the National Laboratory on 26 Jun 2013 for final diagnosis. The National Laboratory then conducted RT-PCR test, direct fluorescent antibody test (not using fresh brain tissue to test), and IHC test, and found positive results by these tests.

Because there was no fresh brain tissue to do the fluorescent antibody test (the gold-standard test of the OIE), in order to confirm these cases, the National Laboratory held an expert committee meeting on 16 Jul 2013 to discuss, and confirmed the cases as rabies. Intensified vaccination activities were conducted in the areas where these dead wild animals were collected, and monitoring is undergoing.
