On 2 Dec 2017, France reported 20 _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Agona cases among infants under 6 months of age, most of whom had consumed different brands of infant milk formula. As of 20 Dec 2017, Sant√© publique France reported 35 cases among infants below one year of age. For most of these cases, consumption of infant milk formula could be confirmed. 16 of the cases were hospitalized and later discharged. No fatalities were reported. The 1st case was retrospectively identified in April 2017.

Based on epidemiological investigations, the consumption of 5 different brands of infant formula from a single processing facility in France was implicated as the vehicle of infection in this outbreak. In December 2017, the producer has voluntarily recalled all infant products produced in the factory in France. As of 5 Jan 2018, according to RASFF, the infant products were distributed to 67 countries worldwide, including 12 EU countries: Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, France, Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands, Romania, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom.

According to the Institut Pasteur, the outbreak strain displays atypical biochemical characteristics, and, contrary to the largest part of _Salmonella_ populations, the strain did not produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and gas during 18 hours incubation on Kligler-Hajna media. This characteristic appears discriminatory enough to identify cases probably associated with this outbreak. This particular trait was found in all 35 cases associated with the outbreak in France, one case in Spain, and one case in Greece.

A joint WGS analysis confirmed that the Spanish case is associated with the ongoing outbreak in France and may provide further confirmation as to whether the Greek case and other possible cases from other countries are also associated with this outbreak. A previous outbreak of _S._ Agona occurred in France in 2004 and 2005 and was associated with consumption of infant milk formula from the same producer.

_S._ Agona is the 10th most common _Salmonella_ serotype in the EU/EEA. In 2012-2016, it was reported by 26 EU/EEA countries with between 400 to 581 cases annually. The United Kingdom, Germany and France accounted for the highest proportion of confirmed cases (30%, 16% and 14%, respectively) during this period. Cases were most frequently detected among adults in the age group 25-44 years (23%) and children under 5 years (22%). No major differences were observed in gender distribution. Travel information was available for 76% of the cases, and, of these, 65% were reported as domestic cases.

ECDC assessment
----------------
This outbreak of _S._ Agona primarily affects infants and is associated with different brands of infant milk formula produced in one factory in France. The products have been distributed to a large number of countries around the world, including countries in the EU. Biochemical tests, and ultimately whole genome sequencing analysis, will confirm whether cases of _S._ Agona in infants are linked to the outbreak. The investigation is still ongoing. A broad recall of infant products, an export ban, and the suspension of market distribution, implemented since the beginning of December 2017, are likely to reduce the risk for new human infections.

ECDC is monitoring the event in EPIS-FWD and is actively engaged in communication with EU/EEA countries that are possibly affected. ECDC is offering whole genome sequencing services to countries which do not have the capacity or possibility to conduct timely analysis, with the comparison of sequences being carried out by the Institut Pasteur in France. ECDC and the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) will publish a joint assessment of this event later in January 2018.
