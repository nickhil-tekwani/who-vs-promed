The Secretariat of Health of Campinas confirmed this Fri 12 Dec 2014 2 more deaths by spotted fever in the city, extending to 5 the number of victims of the disease this year (2014). Last year (2013), there were 3 deaths.

Until September 2014, 3 people had died as a result of the disease. In November 2014, 2 deaths occurred. The 4th victim was a 41-year-old man, a resident in the Southern region of the city. The probable site of infection was in the district of Joaquim Egidio. He died on 10 Nov 2014 in a private hospital of the city. The 5th victim, a man, 58-years-old, lived in the Park New Valencia and died on 12 Nov 2014. According to the City, he would have been infected in de Cosmopolis.

In addition to the work carried out by people who pass out flyers and cards to alert people to the presence of the star tick vector [_Amblyomma cajennense_] in areas considered to be at risk, one of the main actions performed by the doctors is diagnosing the infection quickly.

In 2013, the city recorded 8 cases of spotted fever, with 3 deaths. In 2012, there were 6 cases and 3 deaths.

[The Rocky Mountain spotted fever rickettsia, _Rickettsia rickettsii_, is the cause of this illness, which is also referred to as febre maculosa, Sao Paulo exanthematic typhus, Minas Gerais exanthematic typhus, and Brazilian spotted fever. The organism, which is tickborne, is distributed through much of the USA, including the Rocky Mountains, and also in parts of southern Canada and Central and South America. It is vital to diagnose this rickettsial infection promptly to minimize morbidity and mortality. The number of non-fatal cases of the infection is not stated for 2014.

When the female tick harboring the organism attaches to a passing human, she usually starts low on the body after transferring from grassy vegetation or even directly or indirectly from a dog. After crawling around on clothes seeking an appropriate cutaneous site (wearing white clothes makes a wandering tick easier to spot), she attaches and begins to feed.

If not already partially fed, after attaching, it generally takes 24 hours to activate and transmit the rickettsial organism. For this reason, daily or twice daily tick checks with removal will minimize disease transmission. Ticks that attach in hairy areas such as the scalp or beard may be more difficult to find.

The incubation period of the disease is about a week after the tick exposure, long after the tick has detached. The presenting illness is generally nonspecific, with fever, muscle pains, and headache (but the headache is usually described as quite severe). The rash begins in day 3 of illness, initially maculopapular [a flat rash with small raised bumps] at the wrists and ankles before becoming petechial and purpuric [small and larger red or purple spots caused by bleeding under the skin], involving the palms and soles as well as spreading proximally to the trunk. Purpura usually are not seen before the 6th day of illness. The mortality is indeed quite low if treatment (usually a tetracycline) is begun during the 1st 2 days of the rash or before.

Empiric treatment for this infection should always be started in people with compatible symptoms inhabiting endemic areas during the spring and summer, even if no tick bite is known.
