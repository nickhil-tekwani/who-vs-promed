Three biologists hiked into the Catalinas last week to see what was left of
a leopard frog population decimated by deadly fungus last winter. They were
pleased to find a couple of dozen seemingly healthy juvenile lowland
leopard frogs in the pools of Montrose Canyon, at Catalina State Park,
Arizona. But they saw just one adult, which concerned them.
"That tells me a lot of the adult frogs died last winter in the epidemic,"
said Michael J. Sredl, a herpetologist with the Arizona Game and Fish
Department.
In January, Sredl went to Montrose with researchers Don Swann and Erik
Enderson. They found 110 dead lowland leopard frogs and 1 dead canyon tree
frog. "Almost all the frogs we saw were dead, and if they weren't dead they
were dying," said Swann, a wildlife biologist at Saguaro National Park.
In January, 4 dead or dying adult leopard frogs, 2 tadpoles and a tree frog
were sent to the Arizona Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Tucson. All
the samples tested positive for chytrid skin fungus, which has been blamed
for frog die-offs in Australia, Central America and the United States.
University of Arizona herpetologist Phil Rosen said chytrid fungus killed
leopard frogs at the Cienega Creek nature preserve, southeast of Tucson,
and in the San Bernardino Valley east of Douglas.
The Montrose frog die-off was 1 of 5 that occurred in Arizona last winter,
and all 5 were caused by the chytrid fungus, Sredl said. The fungus kills
adult frogs, not tadpoles.
Chytrids are microscopic organisms in soil and water that help decompose
dead plant and animal matter. Until recently, they had never been known to
cause disease in vertebrates.
Leopard frogs, once common around Tucson, including the Santa Cruz and
Rillito rivers are now hard to find in the Tucson basin and have retreated
to about a dozen spots with year-round water, Sredl said.
Habitat loss and competition from introduced species - bass, sunfish,
catfish, bullfrogs and crawfish - are the main causes of frog declines in
Arizona. Air pollution, water pollution and even increased ultraviolet
radiation because of a thinning ozone layer also have been blamed.
Now chytrid fungus has been added to the list of culprits. But scientists
aren't sure how big a factor it is in the decline of Arizona frogs, how
long the fungus has been here or exactly how it kills the frogs, Sredl said.
The researchers are watching leopard frogs at places like Montrose Canyon
to see how infection rates and mortality vary over time. "It may just be a
transitory thing that passes through these populations. We don't know,"
Sredl said.
On Friday, the Montrose pools were alive with hopping young frogs and
wriggling tadpoles. Runoff from recent rains splashed over boulders while
deer grass, catclaw, seep willows, ash and cottonwoods crowded the banks.
The biologists caught 5 lowland leopard frogs and 1 canyon tree frog. They
checked for signs of chytrid fungus infection: blood-red streaks on the
legs and between the webbing of the feet. "They looked like healthy frogs,
all of them," Sredl said.
The frogs were sent to the diagnostic lab, where veterinary pathologist
Greg Bradley will check for sporangia, microscopic sacs filled with
thousands of chytrid spores.

State biologists studying a large die-off of boreal toads west of Denver
have uncovered a killer fungus that may help solve a global environmental
mystery.
Tests conducted 2 weeks ago on several dead boreal toads revealed they were
infected with a species of chytrid fungus. In all, the Division of Wildlife
has discovered more than 30 dead toads at the site.
The fungus coats the creatures' underside and legs. It is thought to
suffocate the animals, which breathe through their skin. Some scientists
speculate the fungus is releasing a toxin.
For a decade, the decline has worried biologists, who often refer to
amphibians as warning flags for nature. Because of their permeable skin,
and because they are born and develop in the water, they are more sensitive
to changes in the environment, scientists say.
It's also puzzled researchers because frogs, toads and other amphibians
have been affected in near-pristine places, such as wilderness areas - far
from the effects of urban development and many pollution sources.
Scientists still don't know whether the fungus is the primary cause of
death, or - instead - is killing creatures already weakened by other
factors, such as more ultraviolet light penetrating a thinning ozone layer
or chemical contamination that has somehow affected remote areas.
Still, the fungus theory is gaining acceptance worldwide.
The discovery fits into an unfolding picture that has seen the fungus
linked with amphibian declines in Australia and Central America, as well as
in some American zoos and aquariums over the last year. The fungus has
struck 10 species of frogs and toads in Australia, 7 species in Panama, and
6 species in American zoos and aquariums. It was first noticed in arroyo
toads at a zoo in Washington, D.C., in 1988.
The Colorado discovery is likely to draw interest from scientists worldwide
because state biologists had been studying the population for 5 years prior
to the infection.
"It's one of the first, if not the first time that researchers . . . will
have the opportunity to study an outbreak of this [fungus from the
beginning all the way through," said Todd Malmsbury, a spokesman for the
Division of Wildlife.
Scientists do not know where the fungus came from or how it spread. It was
discovered independently by researchers in the United States and Australia.
State biologists will not know how severe the Clear Creek County outbreak
is until toads begin emerging from hibernation next spring, when they hope
to answer that and other questions.
