Health officials have pinpointed the cause of food poisoning that left
hundreds of people ill following a novitiation ceremony in Mandalay's
Amarapura township in early October 2011. Dr Khin Maung Tun, head of
Mandalay Region Department of Health, told The Myanmar Times last week
that the 7 Oct 2011 incident resulted from the poor personal hygiene
of a person preparing food at the event.

Following the outbreak, food samples were sent to the National Health
Laboratory in Yangon and on 18 Oct 2011 the laboratory found that
chicken curry and fried dried shrimp had been [contaminated by a
bacterium.]

"About 12 kinds of food that were served at the ceremony were tested.
A bacterium was found in the chicken curry and fried dried shrimp. It
did not come from the chicken or dried shrimp, rather, they became
contaminated during preparation. _Staphylococcus aureus_ entered the
food and caused food poisoning through its enterotoxin," Dr Khin Maung
Tun said.

Food poisoning victims were admitted to Mandalay General Hospital,
Mandalay Pediatric Hospital, and Amarapura Hospital but all were
discharged the same day.

[Classical food poisoning due to _S. aureus_ presents with a short
incubation period of 4-6 hours as acute nausea and vomiting usually
without fever or diarrhea. The illness generally lasts less than 24
hours.

The following information regarding this entity is extracted from the
USA FDA's Bad Bug Book at
http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/FoodborneIllness/FoodborneIllnessFoodbornePathogensNaturalToxins/BadBugBook/ucm070015.htm

In the diagnosis of staphylococcal foodborne illness, proper
interviews with the victims, and the gathering and analyzing of
epidemiological data, are essential. Incriminated foods should be
collected and examined for staphylococci. The presence of relatively
large numbers of enterotoxigenic staphylococci is good circumstantial
evidence that the food contains toxin. The most conclusive test is the
linking of an illness with a specific food, or, in cases where
multiple vehicles exist, the detection of the toxin in the food
sample(s).

In cases where the food may have been treated to kill the
staphylococci, as in pasteurization or heating, direct microscopic
observation of the food may be an aid in the diagnosis. A number of
serological methods for determining the enterotoxigenicity of _S.
aureus_ isolated from foods, as well as methods for the separation and
detection of toxins in foods, have been developed, and used
successfully, to aid in the diagnosis of the illness. Phage typing may
also be useful when viable staphylococci can be isolated from the
incriminated food, from victims, and from suspected carriers, such as
food handlers.

A toxin dose of less than 1.0 microgram in contaminated food will
produce symptoms of staphylococcal intoxication. This toxin level is
reached when _S. aureus_ populations exceed 100 000 per gram.

Foods that are frequently incriminated in staphylococcal food
poisoning include meat and meat products; poultry and egg products;
salads such as egg, tuna, chicken, potato, and macaroni; bakery
products such as cream-filled pastries, cream pies, and chocolate
eclairs; sandwich fillings; and milk and dairy products. Foods that
require considerable handling during preparation, and that are kept at
slightly elevated temperatures after preparation, are frequently
involved in staphylococcal food poisoning. - Mod.LL]
