At least 38 of the 75 districts in Uttar Pradesh have been gripped by glanders -- a fatal and highly contagious disease found in horses, mules and donkeys -- over the past 2 years.

The National Research Centre for Equines (NRCE) in Hisar, tested at least one positive blood sample randomly taken from each of these districts. "The disease is still sporadic and all our efforts are directed at containing it," said Dr SK Agarwal who heads the team monitoring the disease in the animal husbandry department.

"There is no other way to treat the disease except euthanising the animals. Convincing their owners to do this often hinders our work," he said.

But the department is clearly worried over the spread to newer districts and has stepped up vigil in the state. Precautionary measures were doubled after glanders cases were reported in Delhi and districts like Ghaziabad and Noida were put on high alert.

[India and Brazil are known to lead the list of countries where glanders, a zoonotic, OIE-listed equid disease, is endemic. According to the OIE records, the annual, countrywide numbers of reported glanders outbreaks (in equidae) countrywide were as follows: 2010 - 1; 2011 - 3; 2012 - 1; 2013 - 1; 2014 - 0; 2015 - 5; 2016 - 22. India's OIE annual report for 2017 is not yet available.

No statistics on the incidence of glanders in humans in India could be obtained.

The recent intensified circulation of glanders in India is apparent from the steady increase in the number of glanders cases reported by ProMED-mail since 2014 (see the above and "see also").

Glanders is a contagious and fatal disease of horses, donkeys, and mules caused by infection with the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_. The pathogen causes nodules and ulcerations in the upper respiratory tract and lungs. A skin form also occurs, known as "farcy." Control of glanders requires testing of suspect clinical cases, screening of apparently normal equids, and elimination of reactors. _B. mallei_ can be transmitted to humans, but such cases, which were known to be often fatal, have become rather uncommon (see ref. 1). In view of its zoonotic potential, all infected or contaminated (or potentially infected or contaminated) material must be handled in a laboratory with appropriate biosafety and biosecurity controls following a bio-risk analysis.

The above and additional information on glanders, its causative agent, and its diagnosis is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.11_GLANDERS.pdf. A useful updated review on the disease, including its recent global distribution, is available in ref. 1.

No vaccine against this disease is available; however, prior use of _B. mallei_ as a biological weapon and its high mortality in inhalation animal studies has affirmed _B. mallei_ as a biodefense concern. This encouraged, in the past, studies addressing the development of a human vaccine (ref. 2).
