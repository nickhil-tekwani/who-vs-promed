Two herbal preparations found to contain a blood sugar-lowering drug have
been recalled by two California firms, the Food and Drug Administration
announced Wednesday.
The recalled products are Dianolyn Capsules, made by Diabetic Capital of
Alhambra, California, and Dimelstat, manufactured by SciQuest Lab Inc. of
Brea, California. Both are said to contain "dangerously high" amounts of
glyburide, a drug used to lower blood sugar.
SciQuest and Diabetic Capital announced the recalls in statements released
by the FDA. The announcements are on company letterheads, but they have
virtually identical wording and were based on a model drawn up by the FDA,
according to agency spokesman Brad Stone.
"People who have low blood sugar or those with diabetes run the risk of
serious or life threatening complications if they consume these products,"
the announcements said.
The statements urged consumers to stop using Dianolyn Capsules and
Dimelstat and to seek medical advice, "especially if they are currently
being treated with other anti-diabetic drugs or if they have symptoms of
fatigue, excessive hunger, profuse sweating, or numbness of extremities."
Diabetic Capital said it was recalling all Dianolyn Capsules distributed
prior to Wednesday. It said the product is sold nationally and promoted in
Chinese language radio commercials and newspapers.
Dianolyn Capsules are light brown and packed in blister packs, with 30
capsules per box. The boxes are printed with pictures of a man with green
leaves in the background. The label claims the product contains only
natural herbal ingredients.
Dimelstat capsules are packaged in a white bottle. Each capsule contains a
brown powder and they are sold 60 to the bottle. The product lot number is
0915, the company said. SciQuest sells the product by mail order and
through specialty herb stores.
Both companies said consumers could receive refunds if the products are
returned to the place of purchase. And both companies claimed there have
been no reported illnesses from the products.
The recall action comes just two months after the FDA issued a warning
about five other herbal products that contained blood-sugar lowering drugs.
That warning came after a diabetic herb user in California suffered
hypoglycemia after taking the products.
California investigators found that those five products contained either
glyburide or another suger-lowering drug, even though makers of the
products said they contained only natural Chinese herbs.
