First report of sugarbeet and bean as natural hosts of Chickpea
chlorotic dwarf virus in Iran

Shirin Farzadfar* (Plant Virology Department, Plant Pests and Diseases
Research Institute, P.O. Box 19395-1454, Tehran, Iran), Reza
Pourrahim (as for Farzadfar), Ali Reza Golnaraghi (Research &
Science Branch, Islamic Azad University, P.O. Box 14515-775, Tehran,
Iran), Nooh Shahraeen (as for Farzadfar), and Khaled M. Makkouk
(Virology Laboratory, Germplasm Program, ICARDA. P.O. Box 5466,
Aleppo, Syria). Accepted for publication 8 Apr 2002*

A survey was conducted during August 2001 to identify viruses
infecting sugar beet (_Beta vulgaris_) crops ... in 6 provinces of Iran
[...Semnan, Khorasan, Kermanshah, Qazvin, Fars and Esfahan]. ...
4795 leaf samples were collected randomly from 60 sugar beet fields.
Some samples showed chlorosis and stunting. ... 2 bean (_Phaseolus
vulgaris_) fields with severe stunting, chlorosis and poor pod setting ...
were [also] observed near sugar beet fields in Kermanshah ... [from
which ... 125 samples were collected.
These samples were tested for the presence of Chickpea chlorotic
dwarf [mastre]virus (CpCDV, family Geminiviridae) by tissue blot
immunoassay (TBIA) (Lin et al., 1990) using CpCDV-specific
polyclonal antibody (provided by Dr. [H. J.] Vetten, DSMZ-Germany).
The overall incidences of CpCDV in the sugar beet and bean fields
surveyed were 15 percent and 67 percent, respectively. [ISM] ...
showed geminivirus particles in crude [leaf] extracts of infected sugar
beet and bean. Crop losses in some bean fields in Kermanshah
province were estimated at more than 60 percent.
CpCDV has been previously reported in chickpea (_Cicer arietinum_)
from Iran (Makkouk et al., 2001) but to our knowledge this is the first
report of the natural occurrence ... of CpCDV in sugarbeet and bean
from Iran.

[CpCDV was first recorded in chick pea in India in 1993. It is
transmitted by the leafhopper _Orosius orientalis_ (_Cicadellidae_);
not known to be transmitted mechanically. It is serologically related to
Tobacco yellow dwarf mastrevirus. The virus is a tentative member of
the Mastrevirus genus which consists of 12 defined species and 2
tentative species. Mastreviruses have narrow host ranges; all but 2
species infect grasses (_Poaceae_), family _Graminae_. The 2 others
infect certain solanaceous and leguminous plant species, among others.
