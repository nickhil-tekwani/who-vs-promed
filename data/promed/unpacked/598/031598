FEVER & BIRDWATCHING - SEYCHELLES, TANZANIA (7)
================================================
In regard to Alan Johnston's questions re: his wife's belated
febrile episodes and their possible etiologies, I agree with
the Moderator's comments. I add that there is a virus known
only from the Seychelles. Aride virus was isolated from
|Amblyomma loculosum| ticks by the late Jim Converse. This
virus is presently unclassified (we have not been able to visualize
it by electron microscopy, so even its status as a virus should
be in question, but it is small). The ticks were collected in a
Roseate Tern (|Sterna dougallii|) colony from the birds, the colony
situated on Bird Island. There is no other really useful
information about Aride virus.
Still, the long period (1 month) between visit to the Seychelles (or
to Tanzania) and illness gives one pause when trying to relate the two.
I suggest Dr. Johnston take the offer and suggest a serum sample be
sent to Dr. Woodall, or directly to the Centers for Disease Control
laboratories in Fort Collins, which serves as a reference center for
arbovirus diseases.
A second bout of such febrile episodes and malaria might be a better
bet. Having an expert laboratory test her blood for such parasites at
that time mightbe a good idea.
Toby St. George and others in Australia, as well as many individuals
and teams here and there around the world spent years trying to relate
tick viruses with mild febrile illnesses, some with rashes, but never
turned up anything remarkable. These birds may be the way their ticks
(and their viruses) make a living. Sometimes highly infested (with
ticks) nestlings are found dead but that happens to the best of us,
even when we are uninfested.
