Summary of the current situation in Paraguay
--------------------------------------------
The nationwide epidemiological alert in Paraguay continues, as per
information provided by the Ministry of Public Health and Social
Welfare of Paraguay (MSPBS).
Up to 14 Mar 2007 (Epidemiological Week / EW No. 11), following up on
the February 9 update, official reports are as follows:
- 19 577 suspected cases of dengue fever (DF)
- 46 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)
- 10 fatalities
- Case fatality rate: 21.7 percent
- [Virus] serotype: DEN 3
- Affected areas: Asuncion, Central Department, and other cities
Background
----------
The current dengue outbreak in Paraguay caused by serotype DEN 3 was
preceded by the circulation of the DEN 1 and DEN 2 serotypes in 2002.
The disease reappeared in 2003, 2004, and 2006 with the DEN 3 [virus]
serotype being the most prominent.
During the 2006 outbreak in Asuncion, 4271 cases of dengue [virus]
serotype DEN 3 were reported. The country managed to control the
outbreak and kept transmission at low levels until October [2006],
when the number of cases began to increase.
Current situation
-----------------
Up to Thu 14 Mar 2007, 19 577 recorded cases of dengue were reported,
along with 46 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and 10 deaths:
3 from DHF, 5 from atypical forms, and 2 from undetermined causes.
The national average incidence rate is 325.8 per 100 000 inhabitants
(Source: Mercosur and MSPBS).
- The dengue outbreak is concentrated in the capital city of Asuncion
and in 4 departments: Capital (incidence rate = 1166.6 per 100 000),
Cordillera (392.3), Central (388.4), and Concepcion (336.5). Other
affected departments include Amambay and Paraguari.
- The presence of serotype DEN 3 [virus] in Asuncion could lead to an
outbreak of massive proportions among population groups susceptible
to this serotype if response is not timely and if the necessary
control measures are not taken.
- Climate in the form of continuous rainfall has played a major role
in this outbreak.
Clinical cases of atypical dengue
---------------------------------
The National Commission of Physicians (Comision Nacional de Medicos
de Cierre de Casos) has clinically diagnosed dengue with such severe
unusual manifestations as serious visceral involvement, called
"classic dengue with severe unusual manifestations." This has been
well described in the literature and has become important now because
most of the fatal cases have fit this description. Classic dengue
with severe unusual manifestations affected patients who apparently
had dengue but who developed severe cardiac involvement in the form
of myocarditis, liver failure due to viral hepatitis, pulmonary
involvement due to viral pneumonitis, and involvement of the nervous
system resulting in unconsciousness.
Technical collaboration activities effectively carried out and
facilitated by PAHO/WHO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- PAHO/WHO provided direct technical assistance in the areas of
patient care, mass communication, and health services to strengthen
capacities, timely diagnostic guidelines, adequate case management,
and collaboration in "Dengue Day"(Dia D), among others.
- A mission from Argentina headed by Dr. Elena Pedroni, Director of
Statistics and Health Information at the Ministry of Health, and Dr.
Enrique Vasquez, Consultant at PAHO-Argentina, and later by a
high-level team from the Ministry, offered support for combating the
epidemic, namely by providing vehicles for chemical control agents,
epidemiologists to operate the Situation Room (from their
Epidemiology Division), and a specialist to work at the border area.
Three Argentinian field epidemiologists have also been assigned to the country.
- A mission from Uruguay composed of communicators from their
Ministry of Public Health and from PAHO-Uruguay is providing support
for implementing the Mass Communication Plan for the dengue epidemic.
- Another mission from Peru consisted of a solid-waste expert who can
analyze the situation in relation to breeding sites.
Proposal for immediate PAHO technical cooperation
-------------------------------------------------
- Visit by Dr. Roddy Camino, PAHO-Ecuador, to conduct an analysis of
the current situation together with the MSPBS from 1 to 8 Mar 2007.
- Visit by Dr. Jose Luis San Martin, Regional Advisor from the PAHO
Regional Program on Dengue based in Panama, from 6 to 10 Mar 2007.
- Visits by patient-care expert Dr. Ernesto Pleites from Benjamin
Bloom Hospital in El Salvador for the period of one month, requested
via ministerial letter; Dr. Pleites arrived on Mon 5 Mar 2007.
- Deploying another expert in the clinical aspects of dengue, Dr.
Eric Martinez from the Ministry of Public Health of Cuba, for a
one-week period beginning 7 Mar 2007.
- Sending samples for diagnostic confirmation, sequencing, and viral
genotyping to the National Reference Laboratories in Pergamino,
Argentina (National Institute for Human Viral Diseases / Instituto
Nacional de Enfermedades Virales Humanas / INEVH), or in Curitiba,
Brazil (FIOCRUZ); in addition, technical staff members from Paraguay
will receive hands-on training at these centers.
- Currently under negotiation with resources from the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) is a 2nd stage of the above, sending a
technician from INEVH in Pergamino with the goal of building capacity
in Paraguay, including biosafety and training, once they are in the
physical and technical condition to do so.
- Conducting a technical consultation on Organization of Health
Service Networks for a 2-month period beginning 12 Mar 2007, focusing
on the most affected areas.
- Assessment with the Ministry of Health on the possibility of
receiving support in entomology for vector control and epidemiology;
other equipment and pesticide needs have not been reported yet and
the country's current reserves need to be assessed.
- PAHO and the Ministry of Health collaboratively assessing vector
control and epidemiology, equipment needs, and country reserves.

[Desiree Masi, president of the Paraguay Society of Physicians
estimates that the number of cases is over 150 000, considerably more
than the official figures given above (per AZprensa.com at
<http://www.azprensa.com/noticias_ext.php?idreg=28197&AZPRENSA=1b147c2a4c131f5ac43098a3a774e38f>.
A comprehensive team has been assembled to address what is clearly a
massive, on-going dengue epidemic. Until effective mosquito vector
control is implemented, the epidemic will continue. It is not clear
if the public has been effectively involved in elimination of _Aedes
aegypti_ breeding sites at the household level.

Facing the climatic consequences of the El Nino phenomenon, the
Ministry of Health is reinforcing its intensive preventive sanitary
plan to avoid epidemics in those areas affected by the floods.
The epidemiological map of the Ministry of Health shows that at the
national level, there have been 634 dengue cases with one death from
DHF, 4 cases of yellow fever 3 cases of hantavirus [infection], 32
confirmed and 800 suspected cases of leptospirosis in Chuquisaca.
Of the 634 cases positive for dengue fever, 5 were reported from
Cochabamba, 585 from Santa Cruz, one from Tarija, 4 from Chuquisaca,
one from Potosi, and 38 from the Beni.
The Ministry of Health appropriated 300 000 Bolivianos [equivalent to
nearly USD 39 000. - Mod.TY] for dengue control in the regions
affected by the transmission [of the virus] by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito.
The Epidemiological Unit prepared an insecticide fumigation [program]
for the destruction of mosquito breeding sites. This action will be
accompanied by information, education, and orientation [of the
public] in order to eliminate [mosquito] breeding sites and improve sanitation.
The Minister of Health, Nila Heredia, ... cited the cooperation of
Cuba, Chile, Argentina, USA, and Japan. Spain donated 6 sets of
emergency medical equipment and supplies, which have been distributed
to Santa Cruz (2), Beni (2), Tarija (one) and Cochabamba (one).
"The best way to avoid the arrival of dengue is to dry puddles where
the _Anopheles_ mosquitoes reproduce," she added. [Surely she meant
elimination of water catchments where _Aedes aegypti_ breeds, since
_Anopheles spp._ are not dengue virus vectors. Perhaps she was
misquoted. - Mod.TY]

Formosa, Misiones, and Salta are the provinces with most cases of
dengue fever, according to official data. There are another 608
suspected cases.
According to reports from the national Ministry of Health, the total
of confirmed cases nationally is 149 cases, of which only 3 were
acquired in the country, on the province of Formosa. In recent days,
the number of cases increased by 25 percent, with northern areas the
most affected.
In addition, there are 608 people undergoing studies, suspected of
being infected by the mosquito that transmits dengue [virus]. The
results will be known in the next [few] days for the given provinces.
In Formosa [Province] there are 187 [suspected] cases, with 186 in
Misiones, and 126 in Salta. In Buenos Aires Province 36 persons are
being evaluated [for dengue] as are 26 in the Federal Capital. In

The Argentine government has brought the outbreak of dengue fever
under control with only 38 new cases found in the last 7 days, said
the Health Ministry on Tuesday [13 Mar 2007].
Since the outbreak of the disease in Argentina 3 weeks ago, 156
people had been found infected, but none of them with the fatal
hemorrhagic variant.
Also the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, the spreader of the epidemic, had
not reached the capital, said the ministry, squashing recent rumors
that had worried residents here.
The Ministry said 588 people had sought medical assistance on Monday
[12 Mar 2007] because of dengue-like symptoms.
Formosa on the Paraguayan border reported 197 suspected cases, more
than any other region in Argentina. The ministry has declared
Paraguay a high-risk zone after Paraguay reported an outbreak of the
epidemic, which left 12 people dead.

The [detection] of the 1st dengue case on Thursday [15 Mar 2007] has
provoked a psychological reaction in the Montevideo population, which
has gone to pharmacies to buy [insect] repellents, creams, and
antibiotics against the disease, according to sources from the area.
Also, the telephones of emergency medical [services] and a line to
the Ministry of Public Health have been swamped with calls for advice
and to complain about the presence in the city of the mosquito _Aedes
aegypti_, vector of the disease [virus].
On Thursday [15 Mar 2007] the 1st case of dengue was confirmed in the
country in a 40-year-old employee of a ground cargo transport
[company], who had been in Paraguay. On Wednesday [14 Mar 2007]
larvae of _Aedes aegypti_ were detected in a neighborhood in the
outskirts of the Uruguayan capital.
The officials of the Montevideo municipal government yesterday [16
Mar 2007] began a house-by-house inspection in the Villa Espanola
neighborhood, where _Aedes aegypti_ larvae were found, with the goal
of elimination of [water] containers that favor the reproduction of
this mosquito.

Uruguay's health authorities on Sunday [18 Mar 2007] confirmed the
country's 1st case of domestically caught dengue fever, by a
30-year-old man living in Salto, a city 500 km. (310 miles) from the
capital, Montevideo.
Jorge Basso, director of the National Health Service, told reporters
that definitive results are still 4 to 5 days away, but the patient
was been admitted to a Salto clinic and protected with mosquito nets
to prevent a wider outbreak of dengue, spread by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito.
Uruguay will now apply Phase One of its plan to fight dengue, an
epidemic that has killed 20 and is affecting neighboring Brazil and
Argentina, and nearby Paraguay and Bolivia.
Beginning early Monday [26 Mar 2007], the authorities will fumigate
Salto, a city with a population of 100 000 people on the banks of the
Uruguay River, which marks the border with Argentina.
The authorities are also studying 2 other patients who may have the
disease and are under observation in Montevideo clinics.
The mosquito that transmits dengue had been eliminated from Uruguay
in 1958, but reappeared in 1997, as part of a spread across South
America that began in the 1980s.

A dengue epidemic concentrated in the east-central region of Brazil
left today [9 Mar 2007] its 8th fatal victim in the state of Mato
Grosso do Sul, on the border with Paraguay and Bolivia. The
[government] authorities call for redoubling of preventive action in
the population.
Data from the Ministry of Health released today [9 Mar 2007] (current
as of 24 Feb [2007]) revealed that in the country there have been 67
847 [dengue] cases, of which 44 067 were in Mato Grosso do Sul, an
agricultural and livestock state with a small [human] population.
The Ministry indicated that up to [date] there have been 5 deaths
officially attributed to dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF].
Of the total cases in Mato Grosso do Sul, 31 000 were concentrated in
the capital, Campo Grande, which, according to municipal officials,
is facing the worst [dengue] epidemic in its history, with 500 new
[dengue cases] reported per day.
DHF has caused 8 deaths in Mato Grosso, but these figures are [still]
subject to laboratory confirmation, according to local authorities.
Preliminary data from the Ministry of Health indicate that there were
345 922 dengue cases in 2006, with 78 percent occurring between the
months of January and May, which corresponds to the rainy season in
most of the country. In 2006, there were 628 confirmed cases DHF
[cases], with 67 deaths.

The WHO describes dengue fever as a severe, flu-like illness that
affects infants, young children, and adults but is seldom fatal. The
clinical features of dengue fever vary according to the age of the
patient. Infants and young children may have a non-specific febrile
illness with rash (although some infants and very young children may
develop shock syndrome, with sudden loss of circulating fluid volume,
and die). Older children and adults may have either a mild febrile
syndrome or the classical incapacitating disease, with abrupt onset
and high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and
joint pains, and rash.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a potentially deadly complication that is
characterized by high fever, hemorrhagic phenomena -- often with
enlargement of the liver -- and in severe cases, circulatory failure.
The illness commonly begins with a sudden rise in temperature
accompanied by facial flush and other non-specific constitutional
symptoms of dengue fever. The fever usually continues for 2 to 7 days
and can be as high as 40-41 C (104-105.8 F), possibly with febrile
convulsions and hemorrhagic phenomena. In moderate DHF cases, all
signs and symptoms abate after the fever subsides. In severe cases,
the patient's condition may suddenly deteriorate after a few days of
fever; the temperature drops, followed by signs of circulatory
failure, and the patient may rapidly go into a critical state of
shock and die within 12-24 hours or quickly recover following
appropriate volume replacement therapy. There is no specific
treatment for dengue fever. However, careful clinical management by
experienced physicians and nurses frequently saves the lives of DHF
patients. With appropriate intensive supportive therapy, mortality
may be reduced to less than one percent. Maintenance of the
circulating fluid volume is the central feature of DHF case
management. (Abstracted from the WHO website fact sheet on dengue:
