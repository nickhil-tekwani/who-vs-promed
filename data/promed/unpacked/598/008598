NEWCASTLE DISEASE, PIGEONS: CLASSIFICATION

I would like to add an addendum to the summary of Newcastle disease virus
(NDV) properties that followed the 27 Jul 1999 report of velogenic Newcastle
disease in Venezeula [ref. above].
The specific issue is the classification of the pigeon paramyxoviruses as
lentogenic, which I believe is inconsistent with their known properties.
The pigeon isolates are admittedly difficult to characterize utilizing the
classical velogenic, mesogenic, and lentogenic pathotyping criteria. The
pigeon paramyxoviruses frequently require greater than 90 hours to kill
embryonated chicken eggs, a property of lentogenic strains, but have
intracerebral pathogenicity indices in day-old chicks that are similar to
mesogenic and velogenic strains.
The cause of the 1984 outbreak of Newcastle disease in chickens in Great
Britain was due to pigeon-origin virus. Subsequently laboratory passage of
pigeon isolates in chickens has been shown to increase the virulence of
those isolates for chickens. The amino acid sequence of the fusion protein
cleavage activation site, an important determinant of virulence,
differentiates the mesogens and velogens from the low virulence lentogens.
The fusion protein cleavage site of pigeon paramyxoviruses is like the known
mesogenic and velogenic NDV strains. Consequently the potential risk to
chickens from infections with pigeon isolates is considerably greater than
that from the lentogenic strains such as B1 and La Sota that are routinely
used for live virus vaccination.
