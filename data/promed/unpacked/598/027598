Human Case of Autochthonous West Nile Virus Lineage2 Infection in
Italy, September 2011. Authors: P Bagnarelli

On 10 Sep 2011, a patient in his 50s was admitted to hospital in
Ancona, Italy after 6 days of high fever and no response to
antibiotics. West Nile virus (WNV) infection was suspected after tests
to determine the aetiology of the fever were inconclusive. On 20 Sep
[2011], WNV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies were detected in the
patient's serum. Genomic sequencing of the viral isolate showed that
the virus belonged to WNV lineage 2.

WNV infections have been reported in both humans and horses since the
summer of 2008 in northeastern Italy, but until now, as far as we are
aware, only WNV lineage 1 infections have been described in the
country.

To the best of our knowledge, WNV infection has never been reported
before in horses or other sentinel animals in the Marche region. A
possible arthropod reservoir has never been investigated, but given
the absence of infection in sentinel animals and the absence of
diagnosed cases of WNV meningoencephalitis, the region was considered
to be at lower risk than the WNV-affected areas of northeast of the
country

Discussion
A number of cases of human WNV infection have been reported over the
past few years in Italy [16], but never in or close to the Marche
region, with the exception of one infection acquired through a kidney
transplant from a donor from an affected region. In the Marche, since
the summer of 2010, tests for WNV infection have been performed
exclusively for the differential diagnosis of meningoencephalitis
cases in the summer months . Since the summer of 2011, WNV serological
tests are carried out also for patients with fever of unknown origin
who are negative for Toscana virus. Had this diagnostic algorithm not
been adopted, the cause of the patient's febrile illness would not
have been determined, and the WNV lineage 2 strain would not have been
identified.

Our data show that tests to detect WNV RNA in serum or plasma may give
false-negative results due to the short duration of viraemia. Urine
samples may be more appropriate when looking for the presence of WNV,
because of longer shedding and higher viral load. Whole WNV genome
reconstruction was also easily achieved from the urine sample.

The WNV lineage 1 sequences from human infections in 2008 to 2009 in
Italy were grouped into a distinct cluster within the western
Mediterranean cluster, suggesting autochthonous spread of a single
virus strain without de novo introduction. The finding of the case in
Ancona described in this report might suggest that viral strains
circulating in other European countries during this summer [2011]
might be spreading to Italy. It is possible that the lineage 2 virus
reached Ancona via infected mosquitoes carried by ships or via birds
from the eastern part of Europe. An epidemiological investigation is
underway in the Ancona area to identify risk factors for infection and
the possible local spread of lineage 2 WNV among insect vectors and
birds.

Autochthonous WNV human infection has been reported in several
European countries this summer [2011], including those of the
Mediterranean. As of 20 Oct 2011, 89 confirmed human cases of West
Nile fever have been reported in the European Union (66 in Greece, 13
in Italy and 10 in Romania) and 149 in neighbouring countries (121 in
the Russian Federation, 21 in Israel, 3 in Turkey, 2 in Albania and 2
in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). Notably, cases of WNV
infection in Greece in 2011 occurred in areas that had not been
affected in 2010.

In conclusion, stronger vector control programmes, integrated human
and animal WNV surveillance and implementation of diagnostic
procedures that include testing of urine samples for WNV detection
could provide a useful contribution to controlling WNV spread and
human disease.

[This interesting report of the appearance of WNV lineage 2 in Italy
illustrates the value of effective laboratory diagnostic approaches
and exploring a broad range of etiological agents in cases where
common symptoms occur. Urine testing appears to be more useful than
serological testing or attempts at virus isolation from blood or
cerebral spinal fluid because of longer persistence of WNV in kidneys.
It will be interesting to see whether WNV lineage 2 continues to
spread in Italy and southern Europe as the authors suggest it might.
