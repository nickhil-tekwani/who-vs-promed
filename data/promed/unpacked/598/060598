[1] Case Update
- Epidemiological Situation 30 May 2018. DRC Ministry of Health

May 30, 2018. Epidemiological Situation. Democratic Republic of Congo, Ministry of Health
https://us13.campaign-archive.com/?u=89e5755d2cca4840b1af93176&id=6c2a8df0f2 [in French, machine trans., edited]

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola Virus Disease dated May 29, 2018:
- A total of 53 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, including 36 confirmed, 13 probable and 4 suspected.
- 3 new suspicious cases in Iboko
- 1 negative test in Bikoro
- 1 new case confirmed in Iboko
- No new deaths
Epidemiological analyzes have identified contacts living in nearby health areas in Bikoro and Iboko. These contacts are followed and advised to limit their movements during the entire follow-up period of 21 days.

Remarks
- Negative tests are systematically removed from the summary table.
- The category of probable cases includes all reported deaths for which it was not possible to obtain biological samples for laboratory confirmation.

News from the Ebola response
- Minister of Health enlightening the National Assembly on the situation of the Ebola epidemic
- Following the topical question of the Honorable National Deputy Bavon N'sa Mputu Elima on the Ebola outbreak, the Minister of Health, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, went to the National Assembly this Wed 30 May 2018 in order to enlighten the deputies on the evolution of the situation.
- The questions addressed to the minister focused on the decision of the WHO Emergency Committee not to declare the epidemic a public health emergency of international concern; the concrete steps taken by the government to effectively combat the disease; the epidemic, the nature and scope of the interventions of traditional multilateral partners in the health sector, the epidemiological situation to date, the nature and effectiveness of therapeutic treatments and vaccines administered to patients and caregivers.
Raising awareness of Mbandaka cyclists and motorcyclists
- This Wed 30 May 2018, the communication team of the Ministry of Health has sensitized more than 200 cyclists and motorcycle taxi drivers of the city on the precautionary measures to take to protect against the Ebola virus disease.
- This is a priority target because bicycles and motorcycle taxis are the most popular means of transport used by the population in Mbandaka. When a person is sick, she is often transported by these cyclists or motorcycle taxis to the nearest health center. This is a real danger for the drivers themselves but also for their future passengers.
- In addition, patients who had left the treatment center had been transported with their families by these motorcycle taxis. Through this awareness session, the Ministry of Health team was able to identify 5 drivers who had been in contact with confirmed cases of Ebola. They are now monitored by the monitoring team.

Vaccination
- Following the sensitization of cyclists and motorcycle taxis, all drivers who have been in contact with confirmed cases of Ebola have voluntarily registered to benefit from vaccination.
- Since the launch of the vaccination on 21 May 2018, 561 people have been vaccinated, including 444 in Mbandaka, 74 in Bikoro and 43 in Iboko.

Psycho-social monitoring of students in Iboko
- Following the Ebola outbreak, several schools in the Iboko Health Zone have decided to suspend school activities to protect children. The teams of the Ministry of Health in charge of psycho-social monitoring organized psycho-educational sessions in local primary schools as well as meetings with teachers and parents of pupils.

[2] WHO epidemic modeling

29 May 2018. WHO's Congo Ebola plan assumes 100 to 300 cases over 3 months
[The Globe and Mail] https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-whos-congo-ebola-plan-assumes-100-to-300-cases-over-three-months/ [Byline: Tom Miles]

The World Health Organization assumes 100-300 cases of Ebola in Democratic Republic of Congo between May and July [2018] under a revised response plan to the outbreak that it published on Tuesday [29 May 2018].

An earlier version of the plan, based on information to 15 May 2018 had assumed 80-100 cases.

The WHO says the new figure is not a prediction but part of its modelling to plan and budget for a response. ...

The WHO's plan for Congo assumes each rural Ebola case would have 10 potentially infected contacts, and each urban case would have 30. As of 26 May 2018, there were 906 contacts being followed, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said.

Identifying contacts is crucial for stopping the spread of the disease. Health workers hope to vaccinate every contact to effectively ringfence each Ebola patient and prevent further spread.

The WHO estimates 1000 people move each day through major points of entry connected to Bikoro health zone, the remote area of Equateur province where the outbreak was 1st declared. Around 50 per day go by boat from Bikoro to neighbouring Republic of Congo.

Since the plan was written, the disease has spread to the provincial capital Mbandaka, with an estimated population of 1.5 million people, and WHO has more than doubled its response budget, to USD 56 million from an initial USD 26 million.

The plan also sets out targets for the disease response, including that 100 percent of new cases should come from known contacts, and none of the cases should be health care workers. Zero contacts should be lost, and all people who die from suspected or probable Ebola should be buried in a safe way to prevent the infection from spreading.

The case fatality ratio for all confirmed cases admitted into Ebola treatment centres should be less than 50 percent, it said.

[3] Vaccination strategy and expectations
- MSF ring vaccination strategy
29 May 2018. DRC: MSF Ebola vaccination targets remote communities
[MSF press release, edited] https://prezly.msf.org.uk/drc-msf-ebola-vaccination-targets-remote-communities#

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) yesterday [28 May 2018] started vaccinating Ebola frontline workers in Bikoro, Equateur Province, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where the organisation has been working with the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization (WHO) over the past few weeks. This trial vaccination will also be offered to contacts of patients.

The Ebola vaccine (rVSVDG-ZEBOV-GP) is being used as part of the overall strategy to control the Ebola outbreak. This investigational vaccine has not yet been licensed and is being implemented through a study protocol, which has been accepted by national authorities and the Ethical Review Board in Kinshasa, as well as MSF's Ethical Review Board. The protocol defines to whom, when and how the vaccine should be given.

Participants receive information on the vaccine before consenting and will be carefully monitored over a period of time. Participation is voluntary, and the vaccination is free.

The vaccination will be administered using a "ring" approach. This involves identifying newly diagnosed and laboratory-confirmed Ebola patients and locating the people they have been in contact with. These people and their contacts -- often family members, neighbours, colleagues and friends of the patient -- will constitute the ring. Ebola health workers in the affected area will also be offered the possibility of vaccination, as they are most at risk of exposure to the virus and as such of developing the disease.

Ring vaccination ensures that the vaccination of persons who are in the ring create a buffer zone -- or protective ring -- to prevent the spread of infection.

In collaboration with the Ministry of Health, WHO and other agencies, MSF and its epidemiological research arm Epicentre were involved in vaccine trials in Conakry, Guinea at the end of the Ebola outbreak in 2015.

"Based on the results of these trials, we are confident in using the vaccine for this current outbreak. Given that it has not yet been licensed, we will be closely monitoring the vaccination. The results of the trial suggest that the vaccine will present a real benefit to people at high risk of contracting Ebola, protecting them against the infection. However, vaccination remains just one additional tool in the fight against the disease. Identifying patients and contacts is the 1st step," says Micaela Serafini, Medical Director of MSF in Geneva.

People who are vaccinated continue to follow the same infection control protocols as before, and Ebola health workers will continue wearing protective equipment. The pillars of an Ebola intervention must continue in order to stem the spread:
- providing medical and psychological care, isolation of people who are sick
- outreach activities including tracing and following up contacts
- informing people about the disease, how to prevent it and where to seek care
- supporting existing healthcare
- temporarily adapting cultural behaviour, such as funeral rites

- WHO cautious optimism
29 May 2018. WHO "cautiously optimistic" about Ebola outbreak after vaccinations
[Reuters, edited] http://kfgo.com/news/articles/2018/may/29/who-cautiously-optimistic-about-ebola-outbreak-after-vaccinations/ [Byline: Tom Miles]

The World Health Organization is cautiously optimistic about the progress of the Ebola response in Democratic Republic of Congo after 90 percent of people at risk in the city of Mbandaka were vaccinated, a senior WHO official said on Tuesday [29 May 2018].

Peter Salama, WHO Deputy Director-General for Emergency Preparedness and Response, said more than 400 potential Ebola contacts had been vaccinated. Although he could not say for certain the city had been safeguarded, he was cautiously optimistic, and there had been no explosive increase in cases.

[4] Other experimental therapeutics
30 May 2018. Ebola outbreak opens way to chaotic jockeying to test experimental drugs
[STATnews] https://www.statnews.com/2018/05/30/ebola-experimental-treatments/ [Byline: Helen Branswell]

Companies and other players involved in the development of experimental Ebola drugs are jockeying to have their products tested in the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, part of a chaotic and politically charged effort to use them in the midst of a crisis.

With one vaccine already being used in the field, plans are underway to see whether another might also be tested. And as many as 5 drugs, most of which are not supported by much human data, could be used in head-to-head trials. When considering one of those treatments recently, scientific experts told the World Health Organization they couldn't recommend its use at this time, but the DRC government has already said it's eager to move ahead.

Experts say the maneuvering for space in which to try vaccines and drugs brings to mind the frantic days of the West African Ebola outbreak, when there were so many research teams in the field that a free-for-all of experimental testing ensued. Most of the clinical trials produced little in the way of insight into what actually might work against Ebola.

There's a "rush to evaluate [treatments] because the window of opportunity for evaluating these interventions is always going to be short," said Ross Upshur, a physician and ethicist who was on the WHO panel.

There are "tensions" among organizations "that are rivalrous with each other," not unlike the case in 2014, said Upshur, who is scientific director of Toronto's Bridgepoint Collaboratory for Research and Innovation.

The final decision on which treatments to use rests with the government of the DRC. But the WHO expert panel has sought to provide guidance, and various nonprofits on the ground, particularly Doctors Without Borders, have their own views on the best course ahead.

Still, health officials say the crisis provides a crucial opportunity to better understand how to help contain outbreaks in the future.

"If we don't use the opportunity to learn in this situation, we'll never be able to know which is better than the other in terms of the drugs," said Dr. Peter Salama, the WHO's deputy director-general for emergency response.

Salama urged caution about the utility of experimental treatments, saying the efforts to use them will answer key questions about how feasible these therapies are in low-resource settings. "Everyone's really excited about the use of these drugs, but are they useful in a rural African setting with very little infrastructure? The jury's out," he said.

Bikoro, one of 2 remote communities at the epicenter of the outbreak, has no power, no functioning lab, and very little infrastructure. The other, Iboko, is more remote and out of cellphone range. Health facilities in the region are rudimentary and won't easily lend themselves to the type of intensive care most of these therapies require.

"It's not a simple effort to do this sort of trial in this kind of environment," Salama said.

Three of the other experimental therapeutics are monoclonal antibodies, immune system warriors that can recognize and combat Ebola.

Two are cocktails that combine 3 antibodies: ZMapp, which was tested in West Africa, and a product made by Regeneron called REGN3470-3471-3479, which has already completed a small Phase 1 trial.

The 3rd, called mAb 114, is being developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. It appeared to be efficacious in primate testing, but the Phase 1 study designed to determine whether it's safe to use and to establish the proper dosing only began on 16 May 2018.

The WHO expert panel advised against the use of mAb 114 in the outbreak response, given the limited data. But NIAID Director Dr. Anthony Fauci said he will send 100 doses of mAb 114 at the request of the DRC government.

DRC Health Minister Dr. Oly Ilunga told STAT in an interview that his government was "keen" to use it, nonetheless, because the treatment has its roots in his country's 3rd Ebola outbreak, in 1995 in the city of Kikwit.

The 114 antibody was isolated from the blood of a Kikwit survivor, and the DRC's leading Ebola expert, Jean-Jacques Muyembe, collaborated with the NIAID on the research. Muyembe is the director general of the DRC's National Institute for Biomedical Research.

"For us, it's something very important, because the idea is derived from the research of a Congolese team with Dr. Muyembe," Ilunga said.

There are 2 other drugs being considered for use in the outbreak: an antiviral called Remdesivir being developed by Gilead and a Japanese influenza antiviral known as favipiravir, which was tested in the West African outbreak.

A trial involving favipiravir failed to show it worked, and the WHO expert panel questioned the value of using it. But the fact that it is easier to administer than the others may improve its chances of being used.

The expert panel said ZMapp and Remdesivir ought to be the 1st and 2nd choices, based on the available evidence.

Doses of ZMapp have already been shipped to the DRC, according to Larry Zeitlin, president of San Diego-based Mapp Biopharmaceuticals. Although he would not specify how many doses were shipped, he said in an email that it was "more than they had asked for, and we can resupply quickly and easily should it be needed."

If ZMapp and Remdesivir aren't available, the Regeneron cocktail could be used, the expert panel said. Leah Lipsich, Regeneron's vice president for strategic program direction, said the company has "on the order of 100s of doses that would be ready to ship."

The antibody therapies are delivered by infusion, which requires a level of patient monitoring that will be tough to achieve, Salama warned. And the Gilead drug requires daily kidney and liver function testing, also a challenge in these settings.

Vaccination of health care workers and people who have been in contact with Ebola cases -- and contacts of the contacts -- has been underway since 21 May 2018. This ring vaccination campaign, designed to prevent continued spread of the virus, has already vaccinated more than 400 people, Salama said.

The Merck vaccine is the only one that is currently being used in the ring vaccination program. But people are also eager to see whether a 2nd Ebola vaccine can be tested in this outbreak. This vaccine, made by Johnson & Johnson, requires 2 doses given one or 2 months apart, a drawback in an outbreak setting. Still, it's believed the protection it triggers will last longer than that induced by the Merck vaccine.

The hope is that one day this vaccine, which is methodically making its way towards licensure, could be given to health workers throughout Africa's Ebola zone. In the early days of Ebola outbreaks, healthcare workers are often among the virus's victims, contracting the disease before it is recognized that Ebola is spreading.

Dr. Paul Stoffels, J&J's chief scientific officer, said the company is exploring whether there are ways to use its vaccine in the DRC in this outbreak.

"We are offering, and we are evaluating options. The crisis is such that there is no place for politics and pushing," said Stoffels, who noted J&J has 2 million doses of vaccine it could ship within a day or 2 of being asked. "We are open and ready to do whatever is needed."

With the way the case counts look at the moment, that call may not come. Growth of the outbreak has slowed; the feared explosion of cases in Mbandaka -- a city of over one million people -- so far has not occurred. To date, there have been 51 cases and 25 deaths. Nearly 90 percent of the cases have been in Bikoro and Iboko, a remote village inland from Bikoro.

If spread in Mbandaka has been halted, there may not be a way in for the J&J vaccine, Salama acknowledged.

"Is a trial actively being considered today? No. Is it a potential option at some point if the outbreak gets worse? Yes," Salama said.

[Today's [30 May 2018] DRC MOH update [part 1] notes 3 new suspect cases and one new confirmed case, all in rural Iboko, a slight uptick from the flat numbers of the last several days. As for where the case numbers may be heading, WHO's latest projections are reprinted here in part [2]. As WHO itself emphasizes, the figures are not a prediction of what will happen, but rather a model for what may happen based on certain assumptions. These assumptions, rather than the resulting figures, are what are interesting and worthy of discussion. For today's focus on vaccines and vaccination, one assumption to examine is whether vaccinating all contacts will in fact "ringfence" every Ebola patient to prevent further spread.

As described in its press release [part 3], MSF plans to replicate the ring vaccination strategy using the rVSVDG-ZEBOV vaccine ("the Merck vaccine)" that proved remarkably successful when deployed in Guinea in 2015, where it appeared to be safe and nearly 100% protective in an initial Phase III trial (ref. 1). However, that trial had no placebo arm and was relatively underpowered (ref. 2). As the history of pharmaceutical drug development has shown, numerous therapeutic candidates fail -- usually for efficacy, not toxicity -- when tested in expanded Phase III clinical trials.

Based on the available evidence, I strongly believe that the rVSVDG-ZEBOV vaccine is more effective than placebo, but it is also unrealistic to expect that it will be 100% effective in preventing disease, even if every single contact can be reached and persuaded to undergo vaccination. Safeguarding a large city like Mbandaga is too much to ask of an as yet experimental vaccine, and "cautious optimism," as expressed by WHO official Peter Salama in part [3] should be the watchword of the day.

By all means, all Ebola healthcare workers (HCW's) should be vaccinated, but no vaccinated Ebola HCW in their right mind would go into the high-risk zone of an ETU to care for Ebola patients without wearing PPE and following established infection protection control (IPC) measures. By the same token, vaccination campaigns should be vigorously pursued, but with no letup in the established "pillars" of Ebola intervention, as reiterated in the MSF press release.

Finally, as detailed in part [4], the rVSVDG-ZEBOV vaccine is only one of many vaccine and therapeutic candidates being contemplated or planned for the current Ebola epidemic. These are very well summarized in the STAT article, and more news can be expected if one or more of these candidates are actually deployed in the near future. For now (at the risk of overusing a popular metaphor), the idea of testing experimental drugs in the midst of an ongoing epidemic in a resource-poor country can be likened to "building an airplane while flying it."
