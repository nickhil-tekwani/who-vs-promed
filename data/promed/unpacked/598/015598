Renovating may be all the rage when it comes to older homes, but in some cases there could be danger lurking behind those long-standing walls. That was the case in Quebec, where more than a dozen people became ill with a pneumonia-like infection after the exterior brick of a century-old house was removed as part of a renovation.

The outbreak, which occurred in May [2013], was reported Thursday [2 Jan 2014] in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's weekly morbidity and mortality report [1].

Fourteen people -- including workers, residents of the house and neighbours -- developed symptoms of histoplasmosis, a fungal disease carried in the droppings of bats and birds. Two of the workers were admitted to hospital and the regional public health department was called in to deal with the outbreak.

"We had a declaration from a family doctor who had seen 2 cases, and he was astute enough to realize that something was probably going on at (their) work," said Dr Jean-Luc Grenier, a medical consultant at the Laurentians Public Health Department and a co-author of the CDC report. The home was owned by a married couple who lived on the ground floor of the 2-storey house and rented the upper floor to 2 tenants. The couple had decided to renovate because the exterior brick walls were cracked and in danger of falling.

"There were probably some bats that were able to live there in between the bricks and the (interior) walls," Grenier said of the home, located in Saint-Eustache, Quebec, northwest of Montreal. Over the years, bat droppings containing histoplasmosis spores would have built up inside the walls, he said. As the bricks were pulled down, clouds of dust carrying the dried spores would have become airborne and easily breathed in by anyone nearby.

Grenier said an investigation determined 30 people had been exposed to the spore-laden dust. Of those, 14 got sick with symptoms of histoplasmosis infection, which include high fever, coughing, chest pain and shortness of breath. Those affected included 6 masonry workers, the 2 homeowners, a visitor to the house, 2 neighbours whose bedroom faced the demolition site, and 3 debris sorters. The 2 renters within the home did not get sick.

The debris sorters weren't located in Saint-Eustache, but in the Lanaudiere region many kilometres away, and were unwittingly exposed to histoplasmosis spores. "Those bricks, I don't know why, but they decided to recycle them," Grenier said. "So before knowing there was an outbreak, the bricks were brought in a container to another region far away." There, 2 workers cleaned the bricks so they could be reused. "So they were brushing them to take off the dirt. Those 2 were very sick also because they were exposed directly. They didn't wear any masks."

To remove the health risk, all the bricks taken for recycling were buried, while heavy rains over a few days at the renovation site would have washed away any lingering spores, Grenier said.

All of those sickened recovered and none needed treatment with antifungal medication. Typically, the body's immune system is able to get rid of the infection, although that isn't always the case: people with compromised immune function, such as those being treated for HIV or some cancers, usually need drug treatment. In rare cases, histoplasmosis can be fatal, even with antifungal therapy. "It depends on the dose you get into your lungs and your immune system," Grenier said. "If, for instance, a neighbour had been an old man with immunosuppression, he could get the disease and die."

While the fungus is widely present in soil, cases of histoplasmosis infection are rare in Canada and usually involve construction work that stirs up clouds of dried-up aerosolized spores that people end up inhaling. That's why workers and their employers need to strictly adhere to labour regulations requiring that protective masks or respirators be worn while doing jobs that produce potentially harmful, breathable forms of dust, he said. In this case, the workers had been given masks but didn't wear them continuously because the weather was hot. "The principal message is for workers, because it's workers who probably (have) the most potential to be exposed."

[The news release above refers to a very recent MMWR report of the histoplasmosis outbreak in Quebec, Canada that was associated with the renovation of an old house and involved histoplasma-contaminated brickwork (see reference above).

The outbreak involved 14 persons with respiratory symptoms consistent with histoplasmosis among 30 workers and residents exposed to dust from bird or bat droppings. The diagnosis of histoplasmosis was confirmed in 4 persons: in 2 hospitalized masons by a positive serum and a positive urinary HC antigen test and in 2 debris sorters by a positive urinary HC antigen test. 11 others only had a clinical diagnosis of histoplasmosis. A strong correlation was found between a diagnosis of histoplasmosis and exposure to demolition dust containing bat or bird droppings, and with the handling of contaminated debris away from the work site.

The editorial note from the MMWR publication is extracted below:
"A wide range of activities have been associated with histoplasmosis outbreaks: construction, maintenance, renovation, excavation (4-6); caving (7); school activities or day camp (8); search for treasure (9); and agricultural activities (10), among others. The common variable inherent in these activities is the exposure to bird or bat droppings (1) or contaminated soil.

"When buildings, particularly old houses, have previously sheltered colonies of bats or birds, appropriate measures should be taken before starting renovation work to protect the health of persons in and around the area.

"In this investigation, the confirmation of a diagnosis of histoplasmosis for debris sorters who did not work at the demolition site but handled contaminated materials away from the site demonstrates that the radius of exposure might be greater than expected. As a result, protective measures should be recommended to all workers who might be exposed to contaminated material.

"The findings in this report are subject to at least 2 limitations. First, a conservative approach to risk assessment was adopted by including persons such as residents of the house in the high exposure scenario, and by including clinical cases that could be related to an etiology other than histoplasmosis. Second, the small number of persons involved in this outbreak limits the power of analysis and the conclusions that can be drawn from the investigation. Moreover, the even smaller number of symptomatic persons who were tested for HC antigen reduces the specificity of the diagnosis. Despite these limitations, the high relative risk shows a strong correlation between demolition dust exposure and the onset of disease.

"This outbreak highlights the importance for employers to understand the health risks associated with renovation of old houses in areas where bats or birds roost. Employers should also be made aware of the recommended health measures for their workers, such as wearing a respirator (1)."

Saint-Eustache, with a population of 44 154, is an off-island suburb of Montreal, in western Quebec, Canada, on the north shore of the Riviere des Mille-Iles, about 40 km (25 miles) west of Montreal (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Eustache,_Quebec). Lanaudiere is one of the 17 administrative regions of Quebec, Canada, situated immediately to the northeast of Montreal (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanaudiere). - Mod.ML
