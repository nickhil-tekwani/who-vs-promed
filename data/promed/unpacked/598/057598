A deadly tick-borne virus has killed 8 elderly South Koreans, the state-run disease control agency said Friday [5 Jul 2013]. The latest victim of the severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome [SFTS] virus is a 62-year-old man in the country's southern resort island of Jeju. He died on Thursday [4 Jul 2013] after being treated at a hospital for weeks, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [KCDC]. The 8 deaths occurred mostly in the country's southwest or southeast regions, and the virus has not affected people in Seoul and its adjacent areas, according to the agency. One of the victims died in August last year [2012], though her infection by the virus was identified in laboratories in May this year [2013]. It was the country's 1st death caused by the virus, the agency said.

The virus, which causes high fever, vomiting, diarrhea, multiple organ failure and other blood-related problems, also sickened 5 other elderly people. Some of the 5 were released from the hospital while others remain hospitalized for treatment for the tick-borne disease, said Kim Eun-hee, a deputy director handling cases involving the virus at the KCDC. She did not elaborate on conditions for those who are hospitalised.

[As of Tue 28 May 2013, the Korean Centers for Disease Control had received reports of 47 cases from the clinics; of these, 2 cases were confirmed and 27 cases were negative by RT-PCR. There were 2 additional highly suspected cases of SFTS (one each in Jeju and Gyoungbuk provinces) and a final decision on these cases was awaited. The above report raises the number of fatalities to 8 (with another 5 under treatment), an indication that SFTS is becoming a serious problem in rural areas of South Korea where the tick vector is presumed to be prevalent. The elderly seem to be particularly vulnerable. - Mod.CP]
