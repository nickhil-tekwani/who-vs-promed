PORCINE REPRODUCTIVE & RESPIRATORY SYNDROME - VIET NAM (03): HUMAN
INFECTION DEBATED

I read the 26 May 2010 post about PRRSV being the suspected cause of
a human death. From what I have read for the 26 May 2010 post [see
20100526.1751] and a related 3 May 2010 post [20100503.1432,
published by ProMED-mail's Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance (MBDS)
web-site], it seems very unlikely the cause of death for the
individual was a PRRSV infection.

I realize one of the great benefits of ProMED is quickly getting
information to the public about potential emerging disease issues,
but the 26 May 2010 report seems to have no supporting data for such
an unprecedented claim.

The 3 May 2010 post is a good example of an informative post,
although it is confusing when people are diagnosed with a _Strep
suis_ infection and then are considered to be suffering from "blue
ear," a pig disease believed to be caused by PRRSV, or at least PRRSV
is presumed to play a significant role in the clinical presentation
of blue ear. In the 26 May 2010 report, there is no mention of a
possible _Strep suis_ infection in the affected man (a possibility
based on the 3 May 2010 post), but the etiology of his death is
considered to be blue ear, and thus PRRSV must be the cause. However,
there is no diagnostic evidence presented to support this assumption.

I study pig viruses, and certainly I am sensitive to perceived
zoonotic issues for the swine industry, so please feel free to view
my comment as from someone who carries a bias. However, as just
stated, I see no evidence for what was reported in the 26 May 2010
post. This is important because many people follow ProMED daily, and
this post will cause quite a ripple in the swine industry. I
certainly respect that ProMED is not responsible for economic issues
concerning the swine industry, but I do feel ProMED has an obligation
to pass along lay news reports that contain fact. I do understand
that it is difficult to sometimes sort fact from speculation, so
please do not take my message too negatively.

I enjoy following ProMED and believe the world is a better place
because of ProMED, I just have a concern with the conclusions stated
in the 26 May 2010 post. If there is anything I can do that can be
considered constructive to your program, then please let me know.

[The published view of a Vietnamese medical official that "a young
man was suspected to be the 1st to succumb to the deadly pig disease
PRRS" was posted by ProMED-mail, since it is our job to be an early
warning system. The commentary in the posting, however, rightly made
the point that the report must be regarded with caution in the
absence of confirmatory laboratory diagnosis.

Having said that, Dr Lager's reservations are consensually shared by
ProMED-mail's veterinary moderators. As one of us, Mod.PC, remarked
in an editorial discussion, "pig blood pudding could have contained
any pathogen such as _Strep suis_, _E. coli_ etc., and there was no
information that PRRS had been isolated from the dead human;" and
"there is just no reason to believe that PRRS has suddenly become a
zoonotic disease. What changed? What is different? Just an evolved
virus? It is pretty speculative."

Suspected correlation between PRRS in pigs and human infections with
_Strep suis_ was widely publicised, since 2005, in China and Viet
Nam. For an exhaustive discussion of the issue, in July 2007, see
posting 20070726.2403. And as stated by Mods.QCN/TD in posting
20100503.1432, referred to by Dr Lager, "an experimental study has
shown that many more pigs are affected with meningitis when they are
infected with both _S. suis_ type 2 and PRRS viruses. Therefore,
there is an assumption that the PRRS virus outbreak may have led to
an increased risk of transmission of _S. suis_ to humans through
exposure to pigs with PRRS virus infection and concomitant _S. suis_
disease." This is certainly so when uncooked pig's blood is consumed,
as in the current, fatal case.

Summing up, it seems most unlikely that the case in question was a
human PRRS infection. Obtaining the laboratory results from Viet Nam
will help to definitely refute the speculation. - Mod.AS]
