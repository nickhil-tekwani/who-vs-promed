Since 2 Sep 2014, an increasing number of hotel guests of the Grecotel Marine Palace in Panermos, Crete, Greece, have been sick with sudden onset of vomiting and diarrhea. Currently, at least 70 hotel guests have been affected. The hygienic situation in the hotel, mainly frequented by German and Russian tourists, is somewhat questionable: general access to ice cream containers with publicly used spoons and buffet-style food. Since the hotel is mainly frequented by families with children, foodborne outbreaks are doomed to occur. The hotel management has not upscaled hygiene to control the outbreak since the start of outbreak and has not informed the public health authorities. Based on the symptoms, a toxinogenic cause (such as staphylococci) is most likely.

[It is unclear what the etiology of this outbreak is. Classical food poisoning due to _Staphylococcus aureus_ presents with a short incubation period of 4-6 hours as acute nausea and vomiting and usually without fever or diarrhea. The illness generally lasts less than 24 hours.

The following information regarding this entity is extracted from the US Food and Drug Administration's Bad Bug Book at http://www.fda.gov/food/foodborneillnesscontaminants/causesofillnessbadbugbook/ucm070015.htm:

"In the diagnosis of staphylococcal foodborne illness, proper interviews with the victims and the gathering and analyzing of epidemiological data, are essential. Incriminated foods should be collected and examined for staphylococci. The presence of relatively large numbers of enterotoxigenic staphylococci is good circumstantial evidence that the food contains toxin. The most conclusive test is the linking of an illness with a specific food, or, in cases where multiple vehicles exist, the detection of the toxin in the food sample(s).

"In cases where the food may have been treated to kill the staphylococci, as in pasteurization or heating, direct microscopic observation of the food may be an aid in the diagnosis. A number of serological methods for determining the enterotoxigenicity of _S. aureus_ isolated from foods, as well as methods for the separation and detection of toxins in foods, have been developed, and used successfully, to aid in the diagnosis of the illness. Phage typing may also be useful when viable staphylococci can be isolated from the incriminated food, from victims, and from suspected carriers, such as food handlers.

"A toxin dose of less than 1.0 microgram in contaminated food will produce symptoms of staphylococcal intoxication. This toxin level is reached when _S. aureus_ populations exceed 100 000 per gram.

"Foods that are frequently incriminated in staphylococcal food poisoning include meat and meat products; poultry and egg products; salads such as egg, tuna, chicken, potato, and macaroni; bakery products such as cream-filled pastries, cream pies, and chocolate eclairs; sandwich fillings; and milk and dairy products. Foods that require considerable handling during preparation, and that are kept at slightly elevated temperatures after preparation, are frequently involved in staphylococcal food poisoning." - Mod.LL
