Measles risk from Perth airline flight
--------------------------------------
The Department of Health has today [20 Oct 2008] confirmed measles in
a passenger who arrived in Perth [Western Australia] aboard a Royal
Brunei Airlines flight from Thailand on 1 Oct 2008. The passenger
also attended funeral services held on Fri 3 Oct 2008 before
developing a measles rash the following day [4 Oct 2008]. Medical
Coordinator Communicable Disease Control Dr Paul Effler said measles
was contagious for up to 5 days before the development of the rash
and passengers on the same flights and those at the funeral service
may be at risk of developing measles if they were not immune. "A
person is considered immune to measles if they have received 2 doses
of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine or were born before
1966," he said.

"People who attended the funeral held at 2 pm Fri 3 Oct 2008 in the
auditorium of Winthrop Baptist College in Murdoch, followed by a
burial service at Fremantle Cemetery and a reception at Mount
Pleasant Uniting Church, and are not immune to measles, should
contact the South Metropolitan Public Health Unit at 9431 0200 as
soon as possible (after hours contact Health Direct at 1800 022 222).
They will determine if the individual might benefit from receiving
immune globulin (IG), which, if given early, can prevent or lessen
the severity of measles infection. This is especially important for
infants, unimmunised pregnant women, and people with poor immune
systems."

The Department is attempting to contact those passengers on Royal
Brunei Airways flight BI516 departing Thailand on 30 Sep 2008 and
connecting Flight BI76 departing Brunei on 1 Oct 2008 who are at
greatest risk of developing measles because of their age or seating
arrangements. Dr Effler said it is important that all people on these
flights and those who attended the funeral services be aware of the
possibility of measles illness. "Individuals who develop a fever and
cough or runny nose in the next several weeks should stay at home and
promptly consult their GP," he said. "The patient should mention
their possible contact with measles when they call so they can be
isolated when they arrive at the surgery and prevent the potential
spread of measles to other patients."

Measles is a highly contagious viral illness that can cause serious
disease. Early symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, and sore
eyes followed by a red blotchy rash about 3 days later, starting on
the face and spreading to the rest of the body. Complications
following measles can be very serious and may include ear infections
and pneumonia in about one in every 25 cases. About one person in
every 2000 will develop encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain.

All children who have not been vaccinated against measles should be
considered at risk of getting measles. The 1st measles vaccination is
usually given at 12 months followed by a 2nd dose at 4 years.

[Measles is possibly the most contagious of all viral diseases and
air travel has been the means of transfer of infection from one
country (or continent) to another, as confirmed by the reports listed
below from the ProMED-mail archive. In the present episode there has
been possible risk of transmission of measles virus infection from
Thailand to Brunei and onwards to Western Australia.

However no actual case of transmission has been confirmed so far. The
majority of passengers in these flights are likely to be immune to
measles virus infection if they have received 2 doses of the measles,
mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine or were born before 1966 (that is,
are likely to have been naturally exposed to measles virus infection
during their earlier lives and be immune to reinfection). Some of
those born after 1966 may have escaped MMR vaccination and remain
susceptible. The Australian authorities have been prudent in issuing
a health alert.
