Health officials confirmed on Saturday [29 May 2010], that 41 people
have been infected with anthrax, a deadly bacterial disease
notoriously used in biological warfare, after they ate the meat from 2
carabaos that had died from sickness in Villaviciosa town.

Dr Myrna Cabotaje, director of the Center for Health Development (CHD)
in Cordillera, said the victims were lucky that none of them died.
Cabotaje said the situation has been put under control after
antibiotics were immediately distributed to the residents to mitigate
the effects of the anthrax disease.

Based on the report from the National Epidemiology and Surveillance
Center, which conducted a field-based investigation in the town after
the reported anthrax outbreak, there were 41 confirmed cases. Most of
the patients were men but all of them had skin lesions.

Cabotaje explained that a suspected anthrax case would experience
pruritic (itchy) skin lesions from which lesions progressed from
papule (raised portion of skin), to vesicle (skin lesion with fluid),
then to a black eschar and may be accompanied by edema (swelling) or
abdominal pain, vomiting, dyspnea (difficulty in breathing), and fever.

The Research Institute of Tropical Medicine (RITM) conducted the
laboratory tests that confirmed 2 samples from swabbed lesions were
positive for _Bacillus anthracis_ or anthrax. Cabotaje said the common
denominator among the patients was that they all ate meat from
butchered carabaos that died of unknown causes.

Appropriate samples from the hides of the dead carabaos were sent to
the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) for analysis and results of the
tests are still being awaited for the proper guidance of concerned
agencies.

[There is something odd about this report. The 41 cases are reported
to have fallen ill after eating the meat from 2 sick Carabaos but all
had only cutaneous lesions, not gastro-enteric symptoms. If they had
just skin lesions they got infected from handling the meat, not eating
it. Skin lesions are much more common in humans than the other forms.
Logically this will be because meat is usually well cooked and this
kills the organisms, especially the vegetative cells.

Carabaos are domesticated water buffalo and are used widely in SE Asia
for ploughing and pulling carts (see picture at
<http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2206/2426594373_625e5c51e7.jpg>). And
because of this they are frequently affected with anthrax, die and get
eaten -- a common story in the epidemiology of this disease. Anthrax
outbreaks in carabao are as frequent as those reported in cattle
there. The disease is most frequently reported in the northern Island
of Luzon, which includes Abra.
