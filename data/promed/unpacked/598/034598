Fox exposes person to rabies in Florence County
-----------------------------------------------
One person is undergoing treatment after being exposed to rabies in Florence [South Carolina] by a fox that tested positive for the disease, the Department of Health and Environmental Control [DHEC] reported today [12 May 2015]. The exposure occurred on 8 May 2015, as the victim was exiting a car. The fox tested positive for rabies on 9 May [2015].

"To reduce the risk of getting rabies, we recommend that people avoid wild animals acting tame and tame animals acting wild," said Sandra Craig of DHEC's Bureau of Environmental Health Services (BEHS). "About 275 South Carolinians must undergo preventive treatment for rabies every year, with most exposures coming from bites or scratches by a rabid or suspected rabid animal. Wild animals contract the disease most often, but domestic pets can contract rabies as well.

"If you think you have been exposed to the rabies virus through a bite, scratch or the saliva of a possibly infected animal, immediately wash the affected area with plenty of soap and water," Craig said. "Then be sure to get medical attention and report the incident to DHEC."

During 2014, there were 139 confirmed cases of animal rabies in South Carolina. There have been 53 confirmed cases in animals statewide this year [2015]. This animal is the 1st to test positive in 2015 from Florence County. There were none that tested positive in that county in 2014.

Vaccination is the best way to help protect your pet and your family from this disease. For additional information on rabies, visit http://www.scdhec.gov/rabies, or contact your local DHEC BEHS office at http://www.scdhec.gov/HomeAndEnvironment/DHECLocations/.

For a map of fox rabies in the United States in 2010, go to: http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/resources/publications/2010-surveillance/rabid-foxes.html. It is patently up and down the east coast as well as in every other state except Arizona and Oregon. Wild animals accounted for 92 percent of reported cases of rabies in 2010 -- the last year that CDC has assembled data for. Raccoons continued to be the most frequently reported rabid wildlife species (36.5 percent of all animal cases during 2010), followed by skunks (23.5 percent), bats (23.2 percent), foxes (7.0 percent), and other wild animals, including rodents and lagomorphs (1.8 percent). Reported cases decreased among all wild animals during 2010. For all species from 1960-2010, see: http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/resources/publications/2010-surveillance/rabid-wild-animals.html.

Outbreaks of rabies infections in terrestrial mammals like raccoons, skunks, foxes, and coyotes are found in broad geographic regions across the United States. Geographic boundaries of currently recognized reservoirs for rabies in terrestrial mammals are shown on this map: http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/location/usa/surveillance/wild_animals.html. This differs markedly from the map above, however. But either way, be very cautious when you see a wild animal out during an unusual time of day and/or in an unexpected place. Keep your distance. - Mod.MHJ
