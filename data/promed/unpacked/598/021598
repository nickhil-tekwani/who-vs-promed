UN expert says N. Korean bird flu different from version in Southeast Asian
---------------------------------------------------
The strain of bird flu that has struck poultry in North Korea is different
from the one that has killed dozens of people in Southeast Asia, a UN
expert said Tuesday [5 Apr 2005] after visiting the North.
North Korea has killed some 219 000 birds on 3 farms within a 5-kilometre
radius of Pyongyang, the North's capital, said Hans Wagner, a veterinarian
for the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.
FAO tests confirmed those done by the North that the birds were infected
with the H7 strain -- not the H5 strain that jumped from animals to humans
in Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam, Wagner said. He arrived Tuesday in
Beijing from North Korea.
There are 9 different varieties of the H5 avian flu virus. One strain,
called H5N1, jumped to humans in Asia during 2004, killing 48 people.
Governments of 10 countries slaughtered millions of fowl in order to stop
its spread.
Authorities in North Korea, one of the world's poorest and most secretive
countries, were "very co-operative" and agreed to allow further tests on
bird samples at labs in China, Britain and Australia, Wagner said.
There have been no reports of human infections of any strain of bird flu in
North Korea, he said.
Wagner said officials will also now try to trace the source of the
infection to try and prevent future outbreaks.
"We want to know: how did it come to such a large farm with relatively good
biosecurity measures?" Wagner said. "It came as a surprise to us that it
(occurred at) such a farm."
Poultry production is one of the few growing sectors in North Korea, which
has relied on foreign aid to feed its people since it disclosed in the
mid-1990s that its state farm system had collapsed.
The number of the country's poultry was estimated at 25.5 million in 2004,
about 2 times the level of 1997.

[According to a new definition of avian influenza in OIE's Terrestrial
Animal Health Code, NAI ("Notifiable avian influenza") is an infection of
poultry caused by any influenza A virus of the H5 or H7 subtypes or by any
AI virus with an intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) greater than 1.2.
For more details pertaining to LPNAI and HPNAI, see the commentary to
posting 20041225.3414.
One of the (at least, theoretical) sources of a HPNAI H7 virus is a live AI
virus vaccine. This has been discussed by Swayne in his recent response
(see 20050308.0689):
"In general, use of live AI virus vaccines in poultry is a very risky
proposition, especially for H5 and H7 subtypes, and is in theory strongly
discouraged. The mutation of low-pathogenicity (LP) AI field viruses to
high pathogenicity (HP) is well documented in outbreaks of H5N2 HPAI in USA
(1983-84), H5N2 HPAI in Mexico (1993-95), H7N1 HPAI in Italy (1999-2000),
H7N3 HPAI in Chile (2002), H7N7 HPAI in The Netherlands (2003), and H7N3
HPAI in Canada (2004). If a live H5 or H7 LPAI virus was used as a vaccine,
this replicating LPAI virus would be spread in the field, and like the
original LPAI field virus, could mutate at the proteolytic cleavage site of
the hemagglutinin and become an HPAI virus".
The optimism regarding potential human infections by the current N. Korean
avian influenza virus, following its identification as an H7 subtype, is
understandable in view of the proven pathogenicity of H5 in South East
Asia. However, H7 is not innocent regarding its potential as a human
pathogen. This has been demonstrated during the 2003 influenza A virus H7N7
epizootic in the Netherlands.
During the said epizootic, 86 cases in poultry workers and 3 cases in
people with no poultry contact were initially confirmed by PCR. The
predominant symptom was conjunctivitis. One veterinarian developed fatal
respiratory distress syndrome after close contact with infected poultry.
According to a later estimate based upon serological surveillance (see
20050106.0034), avian influenza A/H7N7 virus infection occurred in at least
1000, and perhaps as many as 2000 people. The seroprevalence of H7
antibodies in people without contact with infected poultry but with close
household contact to an infected poultry worker was 59 percent. This
suggests that the population at risk for avian influenza was not limited to
those in direct contact with infected poultry, and that person-to-person
transmission may have occurred on a large scale.
A final, full identification of the current N. Korean strain, which seems
to be HPNAI, is anticipated. - Mod.AS]
