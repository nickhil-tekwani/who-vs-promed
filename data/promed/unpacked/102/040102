From mid-August 2014 to 24 Sep 2014, a total of 220 people from 32 states were confirmed to have respiratory illness caused by human enterovirus D68 [EV-D68]. The 32 states are Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Virginia, Washington, and West Virginia. The cases of EV-D68 infection were confirmed by the CDC or state public health laboratories that notified CDC. So far, all the cases have been among children except for one adult.

In the upcoming weeks, more states will have confirmed cases of EV-D68 infection.
- The primary reason for increases in cases is that several states are investigating clusters of people with severe respiratory illness, and specimens are still being tested for EV-D68. It can take a while to test specimens and obtain lab results. That's because the testing is complex and slower and can only be done by CDC and a small number of state public health laboratories. As the backlog of specimens is processed, the number of states and confirmed cases will likely increase. These increases will not necessarily reflect changes in real time or mean that the situation is getting worse.
- Some of the increases will be from new EV-D68 infections, since people are more likely to get infected with enteroviruses in the summer and fall. We are currently in the middle of the enterovirus season.

As investigations progress, we will have a better understanding of the trends for EV-D68 infections.

[The CDC 1st highlighted the outbreak on 8 Sep 2014 after investigating clusters of hospitalized kids in Chicago and Kansas City, Missouri. The agency said the primary reason for increases in cases is that several states are investigating clusters of patients who have severe respiratory disease and that testing for EV-D68 is complex and slow and can only be done by the CDC and a "small number" of state public health labs. According to the CDC: "as the backlog of specimens is processed, the number of states and confirmed cases will likely increase. These increases will not necessarily reflect changes in real time or mean that the situation is getting worse." Some increases will be from new EV-D68 infections, though, because we are in the middle of the enterovirus season, the agency said.

Since the previous ProMED-mail report, Rhode Island has reported its 1st case, an adult (http://connecticut.cbslocal.com/2014/09/24/rhode-island-reports-1st-case-of-enterovirus/). On Wed 23 Sep 2014, Ottawa reported that it is seeing a spike in respiratory illness, including cases of EV-D68, a strain of the common cold virus [a rhinovirus] that is causing severe cases, 4 of which have been laboratory confirmed as enterovirus D68 (http://ottawacitizen.com/niews/local-news/cheo-adopts-outbreak-measures-to-deal-with-respiratory-illnesses?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+canwest%2FF291+(Ottawa+Citizen+-+Ottawa+News).

The state public health laboratory in New York State (Wadsworth Center) has performed enterovirus typing on a few hundred enterovirus-positive or entero/rhino-positive respiratory specimens from the past 5 weeks and detected EV-D68 in several dozen pediatric samples. The proportion of EV-D68 positive samples among the submitted specimens has risen significantly during that time, and it has now been detected in patients in all regions of the state. The outbreak is now considered to be widespread in New York State (http://www.cidrap.umn.edu). - Mod.CP
