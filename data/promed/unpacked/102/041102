Dear Colleague,
I have put together some thoughts about what has happened which
you might wish to circulate to CCDCs and other interested people
in your area.
I must stress that the views and interpretations are mine and
should not be taken as any form of official comment from
Department of Health, MAFF or SEAC.
As you will be aware SEAC is due to meet again this weekend and I
would hope to be able to communicate with you again after that.
Best wishes.
Mike

1. What exactly has happened?
The CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh has identified a
distinctive brain pathology in some people with CJD that
appears to be different from anything seen before.
The key histological feature is the presence of a number of
multi-centric amyloid plaques present in all sections examined.
The appearance of these plaques is distinct and has not been
found in sections taken from people with "classical" CJD.
2. How many cases have there been?
To date ten.
3. Over what time period?
The dates of onset of symptoms range from early 1994 to late
1995.
4. What is the age range?
The majority are clustering around the mid to late 20s. Two
are in their late teens and one is in their early 40s.
5. Is there any geographical clustering?
Nothing evident but the number of cases is still very small.
6. Have all the cases died?
No, two are still alive.
7. Is this the forerunner of a massive epidemic?
Not surprisingly this is impossible to say. At the moment I
personally doubt if there will be hundreds of thousands of cases
but I would be surprised if we didn't see any more than ten. I
have no idea what the figure will finally be.
8. Is this new pathology due to eating BSE contaminated beef?
We really do not know but the fact that this pathology has
not been described before leads you to the conclusion that a new
risk factor has appeared. What that might be is not known but
taking into account a possible incubation period of, say, 8 - 10
years the most likely explanation is that it is due to exposure
to the BSE agent.
9. How could the BSE agent have got into human food?
Again we cannot be sure. Muscle tissue has not been shown
to transmit the BSE agent in any of the transmission studies so
far reported. In contrast, high titres of infectivity have been
demonstrated in brain and spinal cord and the reticuloendothelial
system.
One explanation could be that bits of the CNS got into some
meat products such as burgers or pies. Whether a case control
study will ever be able to prove this only time will tell.
10. Does the risk still exist?
In 1989 a ban was put on CNS, tonsils and spleen from cattle
aged over 6 months and thymus, intestines and vertebral columns
of cattle of any age from entering the human or animal food chain
(this is the Specified Bovine Offals ban or SBO).
Last year the ban was extended to meat that had been
mechanically recovered from vertebrae.
Taking this, plus negative transmission studies from muscle,
into account it is fair to say that the risk from eating beef in
1996 has to be many orders of magnitude less than it was
pre-1989. Whether that now equates to zero risk is impossible to
say but it is enough for me not to stop eating beef.
11. Doesn't the appearance of these cases mean that the idea of
controlling spread by banning SBOs was wrong?
Not necessarily. It is clear that enforcement of the SBO
ban was initially not as fully implemented as it should have been
but this has now been addressed.
12. Shouldn't a total ban be put on the consumption of beef?
There is no evidence of infectivity in those parts of the
animal now entering the human food chain. I would find it
difficult to defend a total ban on the available evidence.
13. Isn't it better to be safe rather than sorry though?
We come back to the idea of "zero risk" which is appealing
but in practice is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to
achieve. In a crisis it is difficult to avoid responding in a
purely emotional way but I believe a measured, logical response
does bring about the most satisfactory outcome.
14. Should people who have eaten meat products like burgers or
meat pies be worried?
People are naturally going to be worried and it is
impossible to give them any absolute reassurance. All I can say
is that I think it unlikely that there would have been such a
degree of contamination prior to the SBO ban that there will have
been a major risk to an individual. However, even a very small
individual risk could still add up to a sizeable population
attributable risk.
Since the initial SBO ban the risk of contamination will
have got progressively less as the ban became effective and the
number of infected cattle in the country fell.
19. Is it safe to let children eat beef?
Although transmission studies do not show any infectivity in
muscle it might still exist below the limits of detectability.
The fact that children are still growing and, because of their
age, could have a longer lifetime exposure than adults has raised
this important query. At the moment SEAC have not changed their
advice and there is no recommendation of any restrictions on
children. This subject is due for detailed discussion again this
weekend so watch this space.
20. As 80% of cases of BSE have occurred in dairy cows isn't
there any risk from drinking milk?
It has not been possible to transmit the BSE agent from milk
taken from affected cows so as far as anyone can judge there is
no risk from milk.
21. Is there a screening test to detect people who may be
infected?
No.
22. What about the test being developed by Dr Narang?
I haven't seen the details of the test's sensitivity and
specificity so I can't say whether it would be suitable for
screening for a disease which has a prevalence of 1 in a million.
A specificity of even 99.95% would still throw up 500 false
positives for every true case and the effect of that on the 500
would be catastrophic.
If and when a suitable screening test does become available
I have no doubt its application will be looked at as a matter of
extreme urgency.
23. Is there a screening test to detect people who might be at
increased risk because of a genetic predisposition?
No.
24. Is it likely that there might be a risk of humans catching
scrapie from sheep?
Scrapie has been in the sheep population for at least two
hundred years and has never been known to transmit to humans.
There is absolutely no reason to suppose this has changed.
25. Is it not the case that sheep could have been fed the same
kind of infected feed that caused the problem in cattle?
This is a distinct possibility and transmission experiments
have also shown that it is possible to transmit the agent
obtained from cattle to sheep. However, the pattern of scrapie
in sheep does not seem to have changed recently so there is no
evidence that they are now a problem to humans. MAFF are
continuing to monitor scrapie in flocks and SEAC are kept up to
date with all information.
26. Why was no action taken before this week?
CJD is a very rare disease and is monitored by clinicians
informally reporting cases to the CJD Surveillance Unit in
Edinburgh. Confirmation of the diagnosis can often only be made
by a post mortem examination. When the different pathology was
first noted it was not clear whether this was a normal variation
possibly related to the younger age of the cases. As more cases
with the same picture were detected it became clear that this was
probably not a normal variation. Because of the importance of
the findings the doctors involved wanted colleagues to check
their findings. Only when this had been done and a consensus
view emerged that this was new did SEAC advise the Government
that the information should be made available to the public.
27. Is it likely that there will be person to person spread?
No. People with CJD have never been shown to be able to
transmit the agent to other people. There have been instances
when the agent has been transmitted via surgical instruments used
for taking brain biopsies but this is not the same as normal day
to day activity. There is no reason to suppose that this newly
described form is any different in this respect.
28. What should I say to a GP who has a worried patient?
If the person is otherwise fit and well they should be given
the information stated above and informed that it is very
unlikely that they will suffer any BSE related disease. If the
person is suffering from a neurological condition suggestive of
CJD then the GP should seek an opinion from a local neurologist.
Neurologists are aware they can get advice from the clinicians at
the CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh.
29. Should any special precautions be taken by people working in
butchers' shops or abattoirs?
There have been no cases of the "new" CJD amongst abattoir
workers who you would suppose would be most at-risk. However,
SEAC has advised that HSE should reconsider safety measures in
the industry as a matter of course.
30. Aren't farmers at extra risk of CJD?
It is true that farmers as a group appear to have an excess
number of cases of CJD. However, there are still only a very
small number of them and the same excess has been seen in
countries where there is no BSE. None of the ten cases of "new"
CJD is a farmer.
31. Couldn't this increased rate in farmers be due to something
not connected with BSE such as pesticides?
It is plain that something must be causing the effect in
farmers but we do not know what it is. Pesticides have been
suggested but once again there is no evidence that they are to
blame.
32. What exactly is the cause of BSE?
The debate still goes on to define exactly what the nature
of the agent is. A substantial body of opinion holds that it is
caused by a prion which is a small glycoprotein devoid of nucleic
acid but which can somehow invoke the production of a special
kind of protein in the CNS of susceptible people. There is
another school of thought that holds that the cause is actually
some kind of virus. It is not possible to visualise the agent
although its handiwork is only too apparent.
33. What about inactivating the BSE/CJD agent?
This is very difficult because it is resistant to all the
usual measures including hypochlorite, normal cooking
temperatures, ultra violet light and weak acids.
