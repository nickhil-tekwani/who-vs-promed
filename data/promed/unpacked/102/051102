A goat farm in the southern province of Limburg has been quarantined
following an outbreak of the flu-like disease Q fever, news agency
ANP reports on Monday [30 Mar 2009].

The farm, which has 1000 animals, is the 2nd where Q fever has been
found this year [2009], ANP says. Last year [2008], there was an
outbreak in Noord-Brabant province.

Q fever is spread by livestock, which shed the bacteria in urine,
feces, birth products and milk. The disease, which leads to
spontaneous abortion in sheep and goats, causes flu-like symptoms in
humans and can lead to lung infections.

[According to OIE WAHID, the Netherlands has reported Q fever
outbreaks essentially every year since 1996 in sheep, goats and
cattle; no cases were reported in 1997, but there is a clear
reporting bias towards bovine cases. Only latterly are they reporting
it in sheep and goats, suggesting that it is probably being missed in
small ruminants even now. - Mod.MHJ]
