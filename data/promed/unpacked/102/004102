Five cases of trichinellosis after a boat trip in Nunavut
--------------------------------
The index case was notified to the French Trichinella National
Reference Center, 5 Oct 2009, by Drs. Sandrine Houz and Robert Matra
(Department of Parasitology, Bichat hospital, Paris).

The patient had increased eosinophile counts and muscular enzymes.
The patient belonged to a group of 5 navigators having undertaken the
crossing by the North-West passage in north Canada, from Aleutian
Islands to Greenland. The trip on a sailing ship started in May 2009
and was completed, after 4 months, in September 2009.

During this travel, many stopovers were made in Inuit villages, and,
on these occasions, the crew consumed many kinds of wild animals:
caribou, walrus, seal, polar bear and grizzly.

The 2nd case presented the primary symptoms on 7 Sep 2009 with
shivers and fever, without diarrhoea. She was 1st diagnosed as with
influenza in the particular context of the A(H1N1) pandemic period.
In the absence of improvement under symptomatic treatment, she was
admitted in Lorient regional hospital (Dr F. Lecomte) with high fever
(40.4 C), intense muscular and joint pain, extreme asthenia and
bilateral inferior limbs oedema. She had also increased eosinophiles
and muscular enzymes levels; specific antibodies were detected by
western blot on 29 Sep 2009.

The 3rd and 4th members had asthenia and also increased eosinophiles
and muscular enzymes levels. The 5th patient, living in Brussels, was
1st misdiagnosed for influenza but finally diagnosed as with
trichinellosis (Prof Y. Carlier, ULB, Brussels).

All patients were treated with albendazole. According to the
occurrence of signs and symptoms, the infective meal was probably the
consumption of grizzly steaks on 22 Aug 2009, in Cambridge Bay
(Iqaluktuuttiaq), Victoria Island, Nunavut.

Results of antibodies assays are still pending for the 4 other
patients. A 2nd boat with a crew of 4 members sailed together with
the 1st ship and members fed at the same places. The crew of the 2nd
boat on the way for Halifax has been contacted by email and was
informed of the possibility of the disease and of the specific
measures to undertake. After contacts in Cambridge Bay, we were
informed that all the meat had been consumed locally but well done.

Trichinellosis is a widespread helminthic zoonosis endemic in
Northern Canada where an estimated incidence rate in the indigenous
population is 11 cases per 100 000 (1). Infected polar bear and
walrus meat are the most frequent sources of human trichinellosis. An
outbreak of trichinellosis was already described in Nunavut on Baffin
Island (2) and another in Repulse Bay (3). Other outbreaks were
described in the neighbouring Nunavik (from Inukjuak on south Hudson
Bay and as far north as Salluit), leading to a prevention program for
trichinellosis in Inuit communities (4). We also described, in 2005,
an outbreak after consumption of black-bear in Labrador (5). The
present outbreak could be the most northern described to date in
Canada with grizzly meat. The arctic species of Trichinella (_T.
nativa_) is resistant to freezing temperature and is only killed by
sufficient cooking at 67 C.
