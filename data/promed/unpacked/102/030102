[In May 2015, during the 83rd General Session, the OIE World Assembly of Delegates recognized Slovenia as a country with negligible risk for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). This recognition was based on the fact that Slovenia met all the conditions stipulated in the OIE Code Chapter 11.4. See chapter at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_bse.htm.

The complete list of BSE Risk Status of Member Countries can be found at
http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/official-disease-status/bse/list-of-bse-risk-status/

Among the recommendations set forth in the Code Chapter, Member countries may be considered for negligible risk of BSE if they meet a number of health conditions, among which is that if the country has had an indigenous case, then that affected animal must have been born more than 11 years before it was diagnosed. For this particular case in Slovenia, the affected animal was 12 years old. Slovenia will not lose its BSE negligible-risk status if the type of BSE is determined to be the atypical, or, if it is a classical case, that the affected animal, among other conditions, is confirmed to have been born at least 11 years before it was diagnosed. - Mod CRD
