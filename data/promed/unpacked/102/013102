Measles outbreak in Austria
---------------------------
Up to now there have been about 180 cases of measles in Austria in and
around the city of Salzburg. (There have also been reports of measles
outbreaks in Germany (Bavaria) and Upper Austria). The [Salzburg] outbreak
began in a school, where most of the parents were against any immunisation
(a Waldorfschule).

Measles outbreak in Salzburg
----------------------------
In relation to the accumulation of measles cases in Salzburg Health
Minister Dr Andrea Kdolsky today [2 Apr 2008] stated that appropriate
measures were being taken. Vaccine had been procured and made available. In
coordination with the Salzburg Governor's Office, the Minister of Health
from today will provide free vaccination for health care workers and Red
Cross personnel involved in containment of the the outbreak.

The Minister stressed that there are currently only around 120 cases to
handle. Therefore there is no cause for panic. Kdolsky stated, however,
that there was a need to raise and maintain high vaccination levels to
prevent future epidemics. He emphasized that it is important to raise the
level of vaccina acceptance to protect the whole community.

Measles in Salzburg
-------------------
Health Minister Kdolsky reacted with disbelief to reports today that a
"measles party" had taken place in Salzburg, whereby children had been
deliberately exposed to measles virus infection. "The deliberate exposure
of children to infection is reprehensible and extremely irresponsible.
Suspected cases [of such exposure], must be investigated by an appropriate
authority as part of the surveillance of the outbreak and if appropriate
prosecution considered. This is about the protection of the weakest in our
society -- children."

The conscious attempt to contract measles infection means that parents are
placing their offspring at risk of serious complications in addition to a
skin rash, which may only become apparent after the lapse of several years.

Measles is a disease transmitted by droplet infection. "The best protection
is a timely vaccination against measles, a 2-part vaccination," stressed
the health minister. In this context, all parents in the affected area
should ensure that their children are vaccinated, and it is recommended
that contacts with known measles cases should be avoided.

[Once again an outbreak of measles is occurring among the unimmunised
component of a routinely vaccinated position -- this time perhaps centering
on a school with a particular educational ethos.
