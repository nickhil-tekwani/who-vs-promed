Hundreds of people in the West Java city of Depok were stricken with chikungunya during the past month [March 2014], according to a Tempo report from 3 Apr [2014] (computer translated).

The report states that 700 people have been affected.

One patient described the illness to the news source (loosely translated): "She had crawled for 4 days. At 1st, she just felt feverish and uncomfortable, until finally her whole body swelled. My skin is all red and swollen from feet to face. However, the disease gradually healed by itself. Currently, even 2 children are suffering from the disease." One family said, "we all [are] hit."

The Head of the office for Control, Disease Prevention, and Environmental Health Depok, Martina Rani, claimed to be aware of the disease outbreak. He also claims to have sent a team to the area.

"We have to figure out the chronology of the spread of the disease," he said.

[This is a fairly substantial outbreak of chikungunya virus infections. Chikungunya virus is endemic in Indonesia, and sporadic outbreaks occur in various localities. Within the past 18 months in Indonesia, there have been cases of chikungunya virus infection in Bali, West Sumatra, Central Java, and West Java. There is no indication that the above cases are laboratory confirmed.

Since chikungunya virus infections can lead to incapacitating arthralgia that may persist for weeks or even months, the outbreak may have prolonged social and economic consequences. There is no commercially available vaccine against chikungunya virus infection. The only preventive measure is the avoidance of bites by the vector mosquito.
