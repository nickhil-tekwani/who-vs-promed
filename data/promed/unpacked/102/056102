Three people have died after contracting a rare flesh-eating disease in the
Northern Territory: 2 of them were tourists who became ill after fishing
near Borroloola in the Gulf of Carpentaria and the 3rd was a 19 year old
local girl who had been swimming in a coastal tidal creek. All 3 had other
health problems.
The disease, necrotizing fasciitis, can be caused by marine bacteria, which
get in through cuts in the skin and into the deep tissues and blood.
Survivors often have to have limbs amputated. Menzies School of Health
Research professor Bart Currie announced an investigation into what caused
the vibrio bacteria to proliferate near Borroloola. The world's biggest
lead and zinc mine is close to the township. Professor Currie said the mine
and the infections were not linked.
The deaths occurred between July 2000 and October 2005. The NT Government's
chief health officer Tarun Weeramanthri said flyers had been put up in
Borroloola. "We have to tell people what the risk is and what precautions
they should take without giving a message that no one should go fishing or
launch their boats and get their feet wet," he said.
An article published in a medical journal linked high levels of zinc in the
McArthur River and an increase in the flesh-eating bacteria (Ralph A,
Currie BJ. Vibrio vulnificus and V. parahaemolyticus necrotising fasciitis
in fishermen visiting an estuarine tropical northern Australian location. J
Infect 2007; 54(3): e111-4.).
The 1st case to be recorded in the Territory was in 1988, in Darwin.

An article published in a British medical journal (see reference above) has
found 3 people have died from necrotizing fasciitis after swimming in
rivers in the Borroloola region, southeast of Darwin. The report, written
by Northern Territory tropical disease specialist, Dr Bart Currie, details
4 cases that were detected over 7 years from 2000.
In each case, the patient's legs were ravaged by a bacterium after coming
into contact with rivers in the area, including the McArthur River.
In May 2001, a 63 year old man died 18 days after his legs were exposed to
the waters of the Weirian River while fishing. In July 2000, a 55 year old
man also died 2 years after suffering a similar infection. A 19 year old
woman died in the same area within 24 hours of contracting the disease
after swimming in one of the rivers. In 2003, a 38 year old man with no
medical history, had his lower left leg amputated after suffering a similar
infection.

[Necrotizing fasciitis, often called the "flesh eating disease" involves
the skin and the soft tissues above the muscle layer. It is usually caused
by _Streptococcus pyogenes_ (group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus) or by a
mixture of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. It may be caused by other
organisms including the halophilic vibrios, especially _V. vulnificus_.
Although not specifically mentioned in this posting, _V. vulnificus_ is
most likely the organism in question causing 4 infections and 3 deaths.
_V. vulnificus_ wound infections can begin as redness and swelling at the
site of the wound and rapidly progress in patients at high risk to cause
systemic illness, including necrotizing fasciitis and sepsis. Whether
acquired through wound infection or ingestion of oysters contaminated with
the bacterium, _V. vulnificus_ typically causes a severe and
life-threatening illness characterized by fever and chills, decreased blood
pressure (septic shock), and blood-tinged blistering skin lesions
(hemorrhagic bullae). People with chronic liver disease or
immunocompromising conditions are particularly at risk for severe _V.
vulnificus_ infections. A picture of the characteristic skin lesions can be
found at <http://safeoysters.org/medical/sym_2_photo.jpg>.
Y-H Tsai and colleagues recently reviewed this topic (Necrotizing
soft-tissue infections and sepsis caused by _Vibrio vulnificus_ compared
with those Caused by _Aeromonas_ species. J Bone Joint Surg 2007; 89(A):
631-6).
