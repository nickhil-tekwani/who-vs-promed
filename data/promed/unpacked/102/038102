Scientists have narrowed down the top likely cause of more than 1400 seal deaths across New England in recent months. But they say the "unusual mortality event" appears to be ending as cold weather sets in. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) says the main pathogen found in the stranded seals was phocine distemper virus. It commonly affects seals and could affect pets, but can't be transferred to humans.

NOAA says the peak months of the die-off were August and September. In total, they say more than 1000 seals stranded and died in Maine since July [2018], plus more than 300 others in Massachusetts and New Hampshire.

But now, Seacoast Science Center rescue manager Ashley Stokes says the virus seems to have run its course. "As the temperature drops, the virus can't [replicate] as quickly, so it can't spread as quickly," Stokes says. She notes that warmer temperatures, likely to occur more frequently in New England with climate change, can help viruses and parasites multiply and spread more quickly.

In late November [2018], she says the Science Center tested a dead harp seal for distemper at the University of New Hampshire's (UNH) Veterinary Diagnostic Lab. It's the Science Center's new, local back-up lab for necropsies, with their primary facility -- the New England Aquarium's lab in Quincy -- often at capacity.

Harp seals visit New England seasonally, and NOAA says some have been found dead with phocine distemper this season. But Stokes says their recently necropsied harp seal, a juvenile male found in Rye, did not test positive for the virus. In future, she says the new partnership with UNH could have educational benefits, and will help them conduct more necropsies of protected marine mammals year-round.

"If there's something we can do to prevent it or if we start to see a trend, it just helps show us what's going on in the grand scheme of those animals rather than just simply taking measurements and disposing of them," Stokes says. The lab can also help necropsy dolphins, porpoises, other kinds of seals and some small whales. Larger whale species must be necropsied on the beach where they were found.

[Previous mass mortalities of seals in the North Atlantic have been caused by influenza A viruses. In the past (1979-1983), influenza A virus was isolated from seals that died from pneumonia in New England. The subtype isolated from the last episode was H3N8.

Phocine distemper virus (PDV) was 1st recognized in 1988 following a massive epidemic in harbor and gray seals in north western Europe. Since then, the epidemiology of infection in North Atlantic and Arctic pinnipeds has been investigated. In the western North Atlantic, endemic infection in harp and gray seals predates the European epidemic, with relatively small, localized mortality events occurring primarily in harbor seals.

PDV is expected to circulate in the seals' habitat; it is part of their normal parasite community, so its mere presence is not sufficient explanation of the massive die-off observed. The scenario resembles other wildlife die-off episodes where there is no single culprit, but perhaps a multifactorial web of causation. When parasites/pathogens that are part of the normal parasite community of a host become unusually pathogenic, there might be some underlying context that is affecting that host-parasite relationship. This could be either because pathogen exposure drastically increased or because seals became more susceptible to infection, or both. When the stress-host-parasite equilibrium is broken, the tolerance and resistance to parasites is reduced and hosts become increasingly deteriorated. Both exposure to transmissible diseases and host susceptibility to infection increase, resulting in a vicious circle (for a review on the subject, see https://bibliotecavirtual.unl.edu.ar/publicaciones/index.php/FAVEveterinaria/article/view/5160/8492). - Mod.PMB
