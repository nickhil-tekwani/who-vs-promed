Livestock farmers at Vuma village in Kilifi County are counting their losses after more than 200 head of cattle died in mysterious circumstances early Thursday [8 May 2014] morning.

Residents say the cattle died while at the Mombasa Cement Company, and the irate farmers demonstrated, alleging that their cattle died after they drank contaminated water at the factory.

However, the cement factory supervisor, Javel Bashir Mohamed, dismissed the farmers' insinuations that the firm had poisoned water to kill the animals following its past warning to the farmers against grazing on the land. He said the company has nothing to do with the cattle's deaths and urged residents to wait for a report from the veterinary department. Yesterday [8 May 2014], the cattle's carcasses were lying in different places in the village, raising fears of a disease outbreak, especially with the flooding caused by heavy rains.

The villagers later held demonstrations demanding the factory be closed for causing the cattle's deaths.
