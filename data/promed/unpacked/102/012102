25 New Suspected Avian Influenza Cases
--------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health has said it is testing 13 new suspected human
cases of H5N1 virus infection in the southern Governorate of Missan
and 12 in Sulaimaniyah in northern Iraq. "We're testing blood samples
from 25 locals from the Missan and Sulaimaniyah Governorates because
they've been showing symptoms very similar to those of avian
influenza," said Ibtissam Azize, a spokesman for the bird flu program
at the Health Ministry.
The blood samples are being analyzed in local government
laboratories, and results are expected before Tue 21 Feb 2006. 10
samples have also been sent for simultaneous testing to a World
Health Organization (WHO) laboratory in Cairo, while the remaining 15
are to be transported by the end of the week.
Another 14 suspected cases have been confirmed negative by the [US Naval
Medical Research Unit] laboratory in Cairo, according to Maria Cheng,
spokesperson for the WHO in Geneva.
Since the confirmation of the 1st case, the Ministry of Agriculture
has culled more than one and a half million chickens and ducks in
Iraq, especially in areas close to the village of Raniyah, near the
Turkish border, where the 2 human infections occurred. The government
has said it will compensate all farmers whose poultry are killed. "We
have informed farmers in northern and southern areas that we are
going to compensate their losses from culling," Sami Ruba'ai, a
senior official in the Ministry of Agriculture, said. Ruba'ai added
that on Tue 21 Feb 2006, information on compensation packages would
be released by the Ministry after the national assembly released
details on available budgets. Funding for compensation will be
allocated to the Ministry of Agriculture and for prevention to the
Ministry of Health. "The most probable [scenario] is that we pay
farmers the local price that is being obtained for domestic chickens
in markets, but the confirmation for that will come on Tuesday [21
Feb 2006]," Ruba'ai noted. Some farmers, especially in Kurdistan,
were resisting culling measures, he added. "There are many very
simple [uneducated] people who do not understand that it is an
emergency situation and want to keep their animals at any price. But
if an animal is infected, the final result will be the contamination
of all members of their family," he warned.
Nearly 500 people are now working on the campaign against avian
influenza in Iraq, including doctors in hospitals where suspected
cases are being treated, according to Ministry of Health officials.
"We were not expecting a crisis like this one, and we'll have to
dislocate [reassign] budgets from other sectors for the prevention
campaigns, because it's an emergency situation," Azize explained.

[2] India - suspected human case not confirmed; 95 under test

Indian Government Denies Report of Human Avian Influenza Case in Gujarat
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Indian government said on Sunday [19 Feb 2006] it had found no
case of human avian influenza after preliminary tests on a dead
farmer earlier suspected to have been the country's 1st human victim
of the disease. "Preliminary investigations by the rapid response
teams at Navapur indicate that this patient had no exposure to
poultry," a federal health ministry statement said.
An earlier report from a top administrator of Surat district in the
western state of Gujarat and the state's Health Minister had
suggested the dead man had been a poultry farm worker, but the Health
Ministry statement did not confirm this. The earlier report also said
the man had died of "suspected bird flu," but the Federal Health
Ministry said no human cases had been found.
The world's 2nd most populous country, known for its inadequate
public health infrastructure, was testing people for avian flu after
50 000 birds died in Nandurbar district in western Maharashtra and
tests on some fowl showed H5N1 bird flu.
"There are, however, no reports of any human cases of avian
influenza," the Ministry said in a statement. The statement said that
as of Saturday [18 Feb 2006], there were 6 cases of "upper
respiratory tract infection with mild fever who have histories of
poultry deaths in their backyard farms" [reported] from Navapur. 2 of
these cases were being kept under observation on a hospital isolation
ward, it said. The government said 51 clinical samples from people
who had been in contact with poultry or had symptoms of upper
respiratory infection had been sent to the National Institute of
Virology in Maharashtra's Pune city and 44 samples to the National
Institute of Communicable Diseases in Delhi. "The samples are being
tested as per protocol, and reports are expected in 4 days," the
statement added.
Poultry workers used bare hands and little protective gear to bury
thousands of culled chickens in farms in Nandurbar, ignoring warnings
by health officials. Television images showed workers, who did not
even wear gloves or masks, picking up dead chickens and throwing them
into pits that were later filled with soil by heavy earth movers.
"Culling of chickens will continue today [Sun 19 Feb 2006] and
tomorrow," T.P. Doke, Maharashtra health director, told Reuters from
Nandurbar. "We hope to complete the process of containing the spread
(of bird flu) completely in 4-5 days in phases."
Blood samples were also being taken from people with flu-like
symptoms, and all fever cases in the areas near the affected fowl
were being monitored, officials said. An alert was sounded in many
states across north India, with some states neighboring Maharashtra
sealing their borders to poultry trade. In Mumbai [formerly Bombay],
Maharashtra's bustling capital and India's commercial hub, civic
officials fanned out to markets selling poultry, checking for dead or
sickly birds and asking traders to report any case of bird deaths.
"So far, there is nothing abnormal in Mumbai," said Vijay Dukande, a
municipal market inspector, running his eyes over thousands of
chickens locked inside iron cages in the city's busy Crawford Market.
Maharashtra, India's richest and most industrialized state, has
hundreds of poultry farms, and officials say there are around 900 000
fowl in Nandurbar alone.
Analysts have warned that if the outbreak is not contained, the economic costs
to Asia's 3rd largest economy, which is forecast to grow around 8 percent in
the current financial year to March 2006, would be "very, very high."

[Several similar press reports were received from Mary Marshall,
reiterating that the single suspected case in Gujarat has not been
confirmed and, in fact, that the patient had no contact with poultry.
A total of 95 clinical samples from people who have had contact with
poultry are now under test at the National Institute of Virology in
Pune and the National Institute of Communicable Diseases in Delhi.
None appear to have been referred to a WHO reference laboratory. -
