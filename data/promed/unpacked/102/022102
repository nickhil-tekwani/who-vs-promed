Ministry of Health announces coronavirus case in Riyadh
---------------------
Ministry of Health announced yesterday [19 Nov 2012] the confirmation of a case of coronavirus infection in an individual admitted to a hospital in Riyadh. The ministry statement mentioned that the case was suspected upon admission to the hospital and specimens were sent to laboratories at the Ministry of Health and a sample was sent to a reference laboratory outside of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for confirmation.

The Ministry statement indicated that the laboratory results were positive for [infection with the novel coronavirus], and that the Ministry has taken all actions and precautionary measures to deal with this situation and are in accordance with established norms by WHO and those also recommended by the National Scientific Committee for Infectious Diseases, whose membership includes specialized consultants representing all sectors of government health.

The Ministry statement emphasized that the patient had received appropriate treatment and had recovered. The Ministry assured [the population] there was no indication for concern as these cases have been sporadic and that most of the patients [infected with this virus have recovered]after receiving appropriate supportive therapy that is appropriate for viral infections that cause respiratory illnesses such as seasonal influenza and pneumonia.

The Ministry reassured the population that it is continuing to pursue and monitor situational developments related to this virus in coordination with international and regional medical bodies and organizations.

[This is now the 4th confirmed case of respiratory illness associated with infection with the novel coronavirus (see prior ProMED-mail posts referenced below for more details on this novel coronavirus). According to the brief information provided in the above newswire it appears as though the patient has recovered and is doing well. Of the 3 prior confirmed cases, the 1st case had a fatal outcome, with a clinical presentation of a severe pneumonia and renal failure, the 2nd case had severe illness also associated with a severe pneumonia and renal failure and on last report was in serious condition in a hospital in the UK, and the 3rd case was recovering in a hospital in Riyadh. More detailed information on the clinical presentations of the 3rd and the above mentioned 4th case were not available. The prior confirmed cases had a history of contact with animals in the period prior to onset of illness. None of these 4 cases were reported to be epidemiologically associated with each other.

More information on the results of investigations related to this newly reported case would be greatly appreciated, including clinical presentation, laboratory and epidemiologic investigations. It would be of interest to know if the viruses identified in cases no. 3 and 4 have been sequenced and how closely related they are to each other (as both cases were hospitalized in Riyadh) and to the 1st 2 cases. In addition, results of community based studies if conducted would be of interest in trying to understand the epidemiology of this novel coronavirus.
