Officials investigating a Red River catfish die-off are testing for viruses
-- to rule them out. They believe the culprit is a bacterial infection.
Technicians at the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR)
pathology lab in St Paul are testing for the viral hemorrhagic septicemia
virus, which can cause a wide range of trophy fish, including walleye and
bass, to bleed to death. The virus has not yet been found in North Dakota
or Minnesota. "It's just routine," said Henry Drewes, a regional fisheries
supervisor for DNR. "The preliminary assessment seems to be pointing at
columnaris, a bacterial infection."
Channel catfish virus also is a possible cause, said Lynn Schlueter, Red
River fisheries biologist with the North Dakota Game and Fish Department.
The virus normally occurs in hatcheries where a lot of fish are confined,
but Schlueter said it can strike in the wild if conditions are right. He
compared it to winning the lottery -- "just getting that perfect
combination (of conditions) that really allows it to take off."
Larry Hanson, a catfish virus expert at Mississippi State University's Fish
Diagnostic Laboratory, said he is not aware of any reported cases of the
virus in the wild. "It's almost always in a hatchery environment under
crowded conditions," he said. "It's the time of the year when you would see
it, but generally it's under warm conditions, and rivers are usually not as
warm as a (hatchery) pond environment is," Hanson said. The virus also is
rare in larger, older catfish, he said. Some of the dead catfish were 30
inches (76 cm) long.
An estimated 1600 catfish died in the Grand Forks area. Officials were 1st
notified by a fishing guide who spotted dead fish last weekend [8-9 Sep
2007]. The Red River forms the border between Minnesota and North Dakota,
and wildlife officials from both states are investigating. The die-off
appears to be confined to the Grand Forks area.

[This article is confusing. The 1st paragraph indicates they are testing
for a virus but believe it is bacterial. Surely they are testing for
bacterial diseases. Recently Minnesota also had a columnaris die off. There
is not enough information in the post, although there are a lot of possible
rule-outs.
