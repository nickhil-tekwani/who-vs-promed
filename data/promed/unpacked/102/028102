[1] USA: CDC post vaccination recommendations
[A] Media report
Date: Mon 8 Mar 2021 11:08 AM ET

https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/03/08/974783644/cdc-says-its-safe-for-vaccinated-people-to-do-these-activities


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued new guidance for vaccinated people, giving the green light to resume some pre-pandemic activities and relax precautions that have been in place.

Specifically, the new guidance says, people who are fully vaccinated can visit indoors with other fully vaccinated people without wearing masks or social distancing. People are considered fully vaccinated 2 weeks after they have gotten the 2nd shot of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines (or 2 weeks after receiving the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine).

Vaccinated people can also visit, unmasked, with people from another household who are not yet vaccinated, as long as those people are at low risk of serious illness from the virus. However, the agency said, vaccinated people should continue to wear masks when they're in public, avoid crowds, and take other precautions when gathering with unvaccinated people who are at high risk of serious illness from COVID-19.

The new guidance also allows fully vaccinated individuals to forgo testing and quarantining following a known COVID-19 exposure, as long as they are not experiencing symptoms.

CDC said this new guidance is a "1st step" to returning to everyday activities. There's accumulating evidence to show that people who are fully vaccinated are less likely to become infected and also "potentially" less likely to spread the virus to others, agency officials wrote in a press release. "We know that people want to get vaccinated so they can get back to doing the things they enjoy with the people they love," CDC director Dr Rochelle Walensky said in a statement about the new guidelines.

The new guidance is specific to freedoms that vaccinated people can resume in their own homes, but the agency warns that everyone -- even those who are vaccinated -- should continue to follow recommended guidelines in public settings, including wearing masks.

CDC is not updating its travel guidance at this time, Walensky said at a White House COVID-19 Response Team briefing on Monday [8 Mar 2021]. She stressed that everyone should continue to avoid nonessential trips, regardless of vaccination status. The CDC director cited previous spikes in case counts after surges in travel and the emergence of variants from international locations. Existing travel guidance still applies in the case of fully vaccinated grandparents who are hoping to visit their low-risk family members, Walensky said in response to a reporter's question. "We would like to give the opportunity to vaccinated grandparents to visit their grandchildren and children who are healthy and who are local, but our travel guidance currently has been unchanged," she said.

The 3 available vaccines have been proven to protect against severe illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19, Walensky added. But she said there is still a small risk that vaccinated people could become infected with a mild or asymptomatic disease and potentially even pass it on to others who are not vaccinated. She said this remains an ongoing area of research. Walensky said this is the 1st round of guidance, but more will follow as the science evolves and more people are fully vaccinated. "We believe these recommendations are an important 1st step in our efforts to resume everyday activities in our communities," she said. "However, we remain in the midst of a serious pandemic, and still over 90% of our population is not fully vaccinated, though we are working hard to get there."

The Biden administration is working to scale up vaccine manufacturing and distribution and announced last week [week of 1 Mar 2021] that the country will have enough supply for every adult by the end of May [2021]. The country's 7-day average of daily vaccinations is nearly 2.2 million, and a record-breaking 2.9 million doses were administered on Saturday [6 Mar 2021], according to Andy Slavitt, White House senior adviser on the White House COVID-19 Response Team. Walensky said that as of Monday [8 Mar 2021], about 59 million people in the US have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. And about 31 million people -- or 9.2% of the U.S. population -- are fully vaccinated.

Here's CDC's specific guidance for what fully vaccinated people can do:
-"visit with other fully vaccinated people indoors without wearing masks or physical distancing;
- "visit with unvaccinated people from a single household who are at low risk for severe COVID-19 disease indoors without wearing masks or physical distancing;
- "refrain from quarantine and testing following a known exposure to COVID-19 if asymptomatic."

CDC said fully vaccinated people should continue to take these COVID-19 precautions:
- "take precautions in public like wearing a well-fitted mask and physical distancing;
- "wear masks, practice physical distancing, and adhere to other prevention measures when visiting with unvaccinated people who are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease or who have an unvaccinated household member who is at increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease;
- "wear masks, maintain physical distance, and practice other prevention measures when visiting with unvaccinated people from multiple households;
- "avoid medium- and large-sized in-person gatherings;
- "get tested if experiencing COVID-19 symptoms;
- "follow guidance issued by individual employers;
- "follow CDC and health department travel requirements and recommendations."

When you've been fully vaccinated -- How to protect yourself and others
----------------------------------------------------------------
COVID-19 vaccines are effective at protecting you from getting sick. Based on what we know about COVID-19 vaccines, people who have been fully vaccinated can start to do some things that they had stopped doing because of the pandemic.

We're still learning how vaccines will affect the spread of COVID-19. After you've been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, you should keep taking precautions in public places like wearing a mask, staying 6 feet [2 m] apart from others, and avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces until we know more.

What's changed
--------------
If you've been fully vaccinated:
- You can gather indoors with fully vaccinated people without wearing a mask.
- You can gather indoors with unvaccinated people from one other household (for example, visiting with relatives who all live together) without masks unless any of those people or anyone they live with has an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.
- If you've been around someone who has COVID-19, you do not need to stay away from others or get tested unless you have symptoms.
- However, if you live in a group setting (like a correctional or detention facility or group home) and are around someone who has COVID-19, you should still stay away from others for 14 days and get tested, even if you don't have symptoms.

What hasn't changed
-------------------
For now, if you've been fully vaccinated:
- You should still take steps to protect yourself and others in many situations, like wearing a mask, staying at least 6 feet a[2 m] part from others, and avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces. Take these precautions whenever you are:
-- in public;
-- gathering with unvaccinated people from more than one other household;
-- visiting with an unvaccinated person who is at increased risk of severe illness or death from COVID-19 or who lives with a person at increased risk.
- You should still avoid medium or large-sized gatherings.
- You should still delay domestic and international travel. If you do travel, you'll still need to follow CDC requirements and recommendations.
- You should still watch out for symptoms of COVID-19, especially if you've been around someone who is sick. If you have symptoms of COVID-19, you should get tested and stay home and away from others.
- You will still need to follow guidance at your workplace.

What we know and what we're still learning
------------------------------------------
- We know that COVID-19 vaccines are effective at preventing COVID-19 disease, especially severe illness and death.
- We're still learning how effective the vaccines are against variants of the virus that causes COVID-19. Early data show the vaccines may work against some variants but could be less effective against others.
- We know that other prevention steps help stop the spread of COVID-19 and that these steps are still important, even as vaccines are being distributed.
- We're still learning how well COVID-19 vaccines keep people from spreading the disease.
- Early data show that the vaccines may help keep people from spreading COVID-19, but we are learning more as more people get vaccinated.
- We're still learning how long COVID-19 vaccines can protect people.
- As we know more, CDC will continue to update our recommendations for both vaccinated and unvaccinated people.

Until we know more about those questions, everyone -- even people who've had their vaccines -- should continue taking basic prevention steps when recommended.

[The cautions I am concerned about deal with the final section above: "What we know and what we're still learning". The media have picked up the "do's and don'ts", but haven't mentioned the as yet still unknowns that may influence these current recommendations. Especially those concerning the variants and impact on vaccine efficacy. Are the T-cells primed by the vaccines currently available protective against the variants in circulation or are even vaccinated individuals at risk? If the latter... - Mod.MPP]

[2] Europe: vaccination passport
Date: Sun 7 Mar 2021 11:00 AM GMT+1

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/europe-vaccine-passport-travel/2021/03/05/60db1d8a-7aaa-11eb-8c5e-32e47b42b51b_story.html


Europe debates vaccine passports as a way to save summer tourism
----------------------------------------------------------------
Ahead of Europe's summer holiday season, some top destinations such as Greece and Spain are pushing the European Union to introduce digital "vaccine passports" to ease entry for visitors -- and their tourism cash. But what some countries see as a path toward reopening has been viewed by others, led by France and Germany, as a path toward a 2-tier system that could leave the unvaccinated as outsiders in places such as gyms, restaurants, and cinemas. "Immunity passports could reinforce inequalities both within and between countries," said Emilian Kavalski, a professor at the University of Nottingham's campus in Ningbo, China.

Some countries have already taken steps in that direction. In Britain, now outside the EU, foreign secretary Dominic Raab said vaccine certificates are "under consideration" even as other British officials dismissed the idea. Israel recently launched digital vaccination certificates to allow access to gyms or restaurants.

Israel also agreed to trial a travel bubble with EU members Greece and Cyprus to open the door for vaccinated travelers. Meanwhile, Cyprus has also said it will begin in May [2021] to welcome vaccinated visitors from Britain.

The European Commission is expected to submit a proposal on how to bridge the divides with the bloc this month [March 2021], which could lay out a joint plan for digital vaccination certificates that would work across the EU and potentially beyond.

Compromise proposals could include exceptions for individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 or those who can provide a recent negative test result. It is unclear what a digital vaccine certificate would look like. Personalized QR codes -- used in Israel and difficult to forge -- would be one possible option.

But finding common ground across the EU will not be easy. Vaccination rates vary widely. So does the political will to put the vaccinated in the fast lane for travel -- with countries most dependent on tourism cash leading the way. "Those who are vaccinated should have full freedom," said Austria's chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who has joined Greece and Spain in support of vaccination documents. "Some countries are very much preoccupied with now," Greece's tourism minister, Harry Theocharis, told the Financial Times last month [February 2021], in an apparent reference to German and French hesitancy.

Tourism accounts for about 20 per cent of Greece's GDP, which declined by 10 per cent last year [2020]. "People will gradually realize that there is not much of an alternative," Andreas Papatheodorou, a Greek tourism researcher, said. If no EU-wide solution can be found, Greece and other countries may opt for bilateral deals, he said.

German chancellor Angela Merkel has signalled openness to study possible vaccination certificates later this year [2021]. But she has insisted treating vaccinated travelers preferentially now "isn't on the agenda, given the low vaccination coverage at this point". French officials have made the same argument. They also appear worried about how a proposed pass would be received by the large number of vaccine skeptics in the country. Only around half the population was willing to get vaccinated when the rollout began 2 months ago. French vaccine approval has recently inched upward. Some officials still fear a "vaccination passport" would risk undoing that progress.

Some groups -- including members of ethnic minorities or pregnant women -- would be disproportionately impacted, because COVID vaccination rates among them are lower than in the general population, according to recent studies. Young people who are last in line to receive vaccines or older people with no smartphones would also be disadvantaged.

There is also still no scientific consensus on the extent to which vaccines reduce transmission of the virus, raising the possibility that vaccinated travelers might spread the virus even if they do not get sick themselves, said Melinda Mills, director of the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science at Oxford University.

President Biden said last week that there will be enough vaccines for all US adults by May [2021]. The European Commission hopes to vaccinate 70 per cent of the EU's adult population by the end of the summer [2021], which would still leave more than 100 million Europeans without immunization in late September [2021].

"If you introduce this right away, you'd be excluding a huge group just on age-based discrimination," Mills said of possible "vaccine passports," adding that court challenges would probably follow.

Other questions are piling up, too. Would EU citizens qualify for a certificate if they receive vaccines not approved by the EU drug regulator, such as Russia's Sputnik V and Chinese vaccines? What happens if variants spread that reduce some vaccines' efficacy?

Then there are privacy concerns. For decades, paper certificates have been used for travel to show vaccinations against yellow fever and other diseases. But a digital certification, potentially with QR-codes, raises worries about whether the data could be used to track travelers' movements.

Some global companies have already vowed to make use of their right to ban customers. Alan Joyce, the head of Australia's carrier Qantas, said last year [2020] that proof of vaccination would soon become a prerequisite for flying. "I think that's going to be a common thing, talking to my colleagues in other airlines around the globe," he said. Similar requirements could be introduced for people entering sports stadiums or workplaces.

The idea of requiring travelers to carry health certificates is a relatively modern concept, said Kavalski, who has researched the historical evolution of passports. Passports were widely introduced during World War I in what some saw as a temporary measure. But the 1918 flu pandemic helped shape international travel with "the practice of allowing only 'healthy' bodies to cross borders," Kavalski said. "I would say the [current] pandemic will have a lasting impact on the practices and experience of border crossing," Kavalski said.

[Clearly, the use of vaccination passports is highly controversial as we see discussions play out in Europe at present. The concerns about privacy violations can and could be accepted as for the better public good. With our digital footprints currently, it is a false sense of security that privacy is preserved as evidenced by all of the tracking apps, etc, that have been put into play during the pandemic. The discrimination argument is valid before all adults have access to vaccine. As for those that refuse vaccine, they have exercised their right to refuse, but is there an inherent right for them to put others at risk? There are anecdotal reports of individuals who, knowing themselves to be ill with SARS-CoV-2 infection, have boarded planes to travel. Unfortunately, where there's a will there's a way. While the feeling is that the bar code passports are harder to forge, what about healthcare personnel who are not supporting vaccinations providing such passport authorizations? I am probably making many enemies by my comments here, but I hope I am communicating there are many issues to be resolved before such passports could and should be adopted. I suggest reading a 22 Jan 2021 article raising concerns re the use of health passport (https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2021/01/22/passport-vaccine-covid-flights-international/?itid=lk_interstitial_manual_53). It points out the concerns re dropping quarantine and testing requirements for travellers who are fully vaccinated -- a legitimate concern as we still don't know the impact of vaccination on transmission of the virus, especially the variants. Not a black and white debate here. - Mod.MPP]

Health experts worry about variant-driven surge as states lift restrictions
--------------------------------------------------------------
As authorities relax restrictions meant to curb the coronavirus and the race to vaccinate the public remain under way, experts say the US sits at a potential inflection point, with highly contagious variants threatening an additional surge. Michael T Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy [CIDRAP] at the University of Minnesota and an adviser to President Biden's coronavirus task force, said during a Sunday [7 Mar 2021] interview with NBC's "Meet the Press" that the nation is "in the eye of the hurricane". Other epidemiologists cited concern over the looming spring break season, saying it could accelerate the spread of the new variants.

Here are some significant developments:
- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released guidance on what fully vaccinated Americans can do, saying they can visit nearby grandchildren and dine with one another indoors.
- Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad and his wife, Asma, have tested positive for the coronavirus, his office announced on Monday [8 Mar 2021]. Both are in a stable condition, the statement said.
- Scientists knew that the coronavirus would mutate, they just had no idea it would happen so fast, and now they fear the loose cannon variants could wreck hard-won progress.
- A top medical official with the European Union cautioned against some member states' approval of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine ahead of the bloc's own official review process.
- The support for President Biden's USD 1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package in much of the country suggests a shift in attitude over the role of the government in helping the economy.
- A look inside the shifting messaging and struggle to implement one of Biden's central promises: to get children back into classrooms as soon as possible.
- More than a half-million Americans have died from the coronavirus while nearly 29 million cases have been reported.

Stories of time lost: A girl, almost 9, who never felt like she got to be 8. A 102 year old who lives in isolation. And everyone in between.

The coronavirus pandemic brought out stories of profound grief and heroic resolve.
These are not those stories.

Instead, at this one-year mark, Style [Washington Post] reporters set out to note some of the other, countless emotions and personal losses: The almost-9 year old who never felt like she got to be 8. The 102 year old who lives in mandated isolation. The massage therapist and her customers who simply crave touch. The couple who postponed their big wedding -- and may have to postpone it again. The single person losing her last sense of social contact. The DJ who spins for an empty room. The college freshman who has never set foot on campus. Shutdowns, lockdowns, quarantines -- whatever you called this long and lost time, these stories acknowledge the persistent disconnect, all that absence, and what it feels like to live in a suspended state of mind.

China awash in 'cherry freedom' despite virus fears
Among Chinese youths, the term "cherry freedom" has meant the aspirational level of financial security where you can buy premium fruits whenever the whim strikes. So it came as a shock when cherry freedom suddenly arrived for everyone. In January [2021], Chinese media reported that packaging from a shipment of Chilean cherries had tested positive for the coronavirus. In the confusion that followed, Chinese retailers dumped cherry orders and consumers shunned the fruit. Chinese health experts went on TV to say cherries were safe to eat if you washed them (the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the risk from eating or handling food is "very low"), while Chile's embassy said it hadn't been confirmed that the tainted batch was from Chile. But it was too late: Prices collapsed as 288 000 tons of imported Chilean cherries approached their expiration date.

Analysis: What the media should not do when battling vaccine misinformation
There are all sorts of ways to counter reluctance to get the coronavirus vaccine. There's leading by example. There's guilt. And there's pure charm. Dolly Parton went the latter route last week [2 Mar 2021] as she got her 1st shot, wearing a sparkly blue cold-shoulder dress for her Instagram PSA and crooning "Vaccine" to the tune of her signature "Jolene". Despite all this high-level persuasion, a big chunk of Americans -- about 3 in 10 -- remain hesitant, according to a new Pew Research survey. The news media has a role to play -- not in outright advocacy, but in relentlessly providing accurate, nuanced information and answering questions straightforwardly. "There is a lot to be said for honestly reporting as much context as possible and knowing the terrain into which your sound bites and headlines will play," said Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University.

People threaten to call ICE [US Immigration and Customs Enforcement] after a Mexican restaurant in Texas keeps its mask rules
When the coronavirus pandemic hit and restaurant owners faced difficult decisions, the Richards family that owns Picos, a Mexican restaurant in Houston, quickly adapted to continue sharing their Latin cuisine -- from selling to-go margarita kits to stationing a mariachi band at the curbside pickup. This week, after Texas governor Greg Abbott (R) said on Tuesday [2 Mar 2021] that he would rescind the statewide mask mandate, while the vast majority of residents remain unvaccinated, the tough choice to enforce public health guidance fell to business owners, and Picos announced it would continue requiring masks. But, after such a challenging year, the reaction to their decision was disheartening, co-owner Monica Richards said: Several people sent hateful messages through social media and called the restaurant, threatening to report staffers to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The whiplash of Pope Francis's Iraq trip: A year of tight COVID-19 rules in Italy, then 72 hours of crowds
Aboard the papal plane -- By almost every measurement, Pope Francis's trip to Iraq was stunning. He went to a country no pope had visited before, at a time when few other global figures were traveling. He led prayer in the very place where, just 7 years earlier, the Islamic State's leader had proclaimed a caliphate that would "conquer Rome". The crowds were adoring, ululating, sometimes crying. The theater was unbeatable. And yet, amid all this, I kept thinking about the coronavirus. Almost everywhere Francis went, there were crowds. Big crowds of unvaccinated people, shoulder-to-shoulder. Francis's outdoor Mass in Irbil, capital of the semiautonomous Iraqi region of Kurdistan, had nearly the attendance of the Super Bowl, but in a dramatically smaller stadium; few were wearing masks. Most startling was an indoor Mass on Saturday night [5 Mar 2021] in Baghdad, in a packed church with people singing and almost no ventilation. I was a pool reporter for that service; it felt like standing in a coronavirus nuclear reactor[see photograph at https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DC446WT73UI6XPRCGLJTDWDVGA.jpg&w=916

How a year lived online has changed our children
Like many parents just trying to get to the other side of a pandemic in one piece, [I L-L] doesn't have the bandwidth to micromanage screen time for her 2 older kids. By giving up some, but not all, control, she and other parents have been able to see firsthand the good and bad of letting kids lead the way with their own technology usage. "Screen time" -- as a concept to track meticulously, to fret and panic about, to measure parents' worth in -- is no longer considered a valid framework in a pandemic world, where the way we live our lives has been completely redefined. Since schools in the United States began closing down roughly a year ago, the country's children have been adapting, learning, and getting creative with how they use technology. The realities of their day-to-day lives have varied wildly, as have their relationships with screens.

Japan battles new variants as vaccine program is in disarray
Japan's coronavirus vaccination program is in disarray -- mostly from self-inflicted wounds. Vaccinations are at a crawl, upending hopeful predictions that life could start to return to normal by the summer. Even before a 3rd wave of infections is under control, many health experts are predicting another possible surge ahead of the summer's Olympics. Japan's government boasts of its success in containing the worst of the pandemic. But medical experts tell a different story -- a failure to meet the moment, and of a slow-moving government and bureaucracy struggling to adapt to a fast-moving pandemic. It adds up to a jolting contrast as many other wealthy nations have their feet on the gas to accelerate and expand vaccinations. Japan's very slow rollout also is likely to undermine support for beleaguered prime minister Yoshihide Suga and delay Japan's economic recovery.

Israel begins vaccinating 100 000 Palestinian day laborers
Israel on Monday [8 Mar 2021] kicked off its 2-week campaign to vaccinate more than 100 000 Palestinians carrying Israeli work permits even as coronavirus vaccinations remained a distant dream for most residents of the West Bank. At the crossing of Sha'ar Efraim, the Israeli military set up one of 8 vaccination centers -- with the capacity to vaccinate 1000 people a day -- along the 440-mile [708 km] barrier dividing Israel from the Palestinian territories. "It is within both Israeli and Palestinian interests that we vaccinate the workers, since, as we know, coronavirus knows no geographical boundaries," said Lior Wisbaum, foreign relations officer for the coordinator of government activities in the Territories, or COGAT, the Israeli military agency that coordinates with the Palestinian Authority.

White House: 'Hopeful day' as vaccinations jump, Senate passes American Rescue Plan, CDC issues guidance
The Biden administration on Monday [8 Mar 2021] touted the increased pace of vaccinations and the Senate's passage of the American Rescue Plan as promising signs in the "war" on the coronavirus. "President Biden came into office with 2 clear immediate goals -- mount a vaccination program to turn the tide on the pandemic and pass a rescue plan to bring the nation through these tough times successfully," Andy Slavitt, senior White House adviser for the coronavirus response, told reporters at a press briefing. "This weekend, we took critical steps on both fronts." Slavitt noted that the nation's vaccination pace has sped up, with nearly 2.2 million shots a day administered in the past week, up from about 900 000 when Biden took office [20 Jan 2021]. Slavitt also said that Congress's USD1.9 trillion legislative package, directed by Biden, would address poverty while ramping up other resources to fight the pandemic. Marcella Nunez-Smith, who's leading the Biden administration's work on health equity and the coronavirus, pointed to progress rolling out community vaccination centers that are focused on hard-hit, high-risk communities. "By the end of this week, we'll have 18 of those sites running across 7 states, with the ability to administer 61 000 total shots per week," Nunez-Smith said. Nunez-Smith also said that the administration is still working on its planned messaging campaign to address vaccine hesitancy. Nearly one-third of GOP voters say they "definitely won't" get the vaccine, and polls have found widespread skepticism in communities of color, as well. Meanwhile, Anthony S Fauci, the nation's leading infectious-disease expert, offered a brief update on researchers' efforts to develop antivirals that hinder the progression of COVID-19 symptoms and help infected people avoid needing to be hospitalized. "That is the direction that we will be going over the next weeks to months to years," Fauci said, comparing the fight to the effort to combat HIV. At the briefing, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky also unveiled long-awaited guidance on how vaccinated Americans can socialize and pursue daily activities. "I hope people view this as a hopeful day in the next steps of the pandemic," Slavitt said.

SWAT [special weapons and tactics, a law enforcement unit]] team called into maskless Boulder college party where students set off fireworks and flipped a car
By the time police arrived, the party had been raging for hours. Beginning late Saturday afternoon [6 Mar 2021], music bumped as 500 -- 800 maskless revelers swarmed a street in a neighborhood near the University of Colorado at Boulder. The cheering crowd later blasted fireworks into the sky and flipped a car. Law enforcement officers showed up with a SWAT vehicle at about 8:30 pm local time. Using a loudspeaker, they warned, "If you fail to leave, you will be subject to arrest and the use of tear gas." Many students cleared out. Others stayed, shouting expletives at police. About 100 ran toward authorities, police said, and several threw bottles and rocks. The chaos, which unfolded a day after Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) paid tribute to the state's nearly 6000 COVID-19 victims, ended with police reporting minor injuries to several officers, along with damage to community and public-safety vehicles.

Inside Biden's struggle to meet his school reopening promises
The promise was clear and hopeful: With strong public health measures, then-president-elect Joe Biden declared in early December [2020], "the majority of our schools can be open by the end of my 1st 100 days." The reality has been far more complicated. First came the clarification on Biden's 1st full day as president, when the administration released a 200-page coronavirus response plan that explained the schools reopening plan included only K-8 schools -- not high schools -- in those 1st 100 days. Then came a walk-back from White House press secretary Jen Psaki, who said the administration's goal was only to have the majority of schools back in classrooms "at least one day a week." And finally came Biden's walk-back of the walk-back in a CNN town hall, where he described the one-day-a-week standard as a "mistake in the communication."

Meet the GOP [Republican Party] voters who could decide whether the US reaches herd immunity
[M], an 80 year old retiree who lives outside Tulsa, has spent the past year living in fear of the coronavirus. She's constantly worn masks, toted hand sanitizer, and used drive-throughs to run her errands. Her age and preexisting health conditions -- including heart failure, diabetes, and blood clots -- put her at elevated risk if she gets sick. But unlike many at-risk Americans seeking safety and an end to the pandemic, [M] refuses to get a coronavirus vaccine. "There's too many unanswered questions," said [M]. [She] also said she's fearful of possible side effects such as the headaches that some people have gotten from the 2nd shot. "I'd just as soon as not go through that," she said.

[This set of news snippets from the Washington Post covers an array of how responses to COVID-19 vary among different states and different individuals. Some very poignant vignettes are included, description of fear in some individuals, defiant responses by others, some trying to provide guidance and support to individuals struggling to make it through the pandemic, and more. Children to seniors have been affected, as has every single individual by this viral disease, either directly or indirectly. One hopes that should an existing or new variant pose even a graver risk, vaccine makers will be able to respond rapidly as they are currently doing. And further, one hopes the public health infrastructure that has been strengthened by this pandemic will be maintained to battle the next outbreak, which no doubt will come in the future. Trained health care and laboratory personnel are a precious commodity that must be protected. The lessons learned from how this pandemic was handled should be discussed and plans made so mistakes are not repeated. - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (48 402), and Brazil (36 136), have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 7249 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 7 Mar 2021 to late 8 Mar 2021). Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (7 countries) include the USA, Brazil, India (15 353), Italy (13 882), Turkey (13 215), Spain (11 958), and Russia (10 253). A total of 49 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 23 of the 49 countries are from the European region, 10 are from the Americas region, 9 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 1.0%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 3.9%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show an 11.8% decrease in daily reported cases and a 22.1% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: Weekend artifact still present. The global daily reported cases totaled over 313 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 117.74 million cumulative reported cases and over 2.61 million reported deaths. - Mod.MPP]
