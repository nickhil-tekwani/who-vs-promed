I support Dr. Taylor's concern for the workload of local health departments
in investigating and reporting reportable cases of communicable diseases.
I do take exception to the moderator's rationale for the expedited
reporting of all cases of plague, regardless of the source of exposure. A
tourist's risk of plague on visiting an area, such as the American Rocky
[Mountains, is independent of whether a case has recently occurred at a
specific site in that area. A single case of plague, which may have been
acquired on private property inaccessible to tourists, is much different
than an ongoing epidemic of dengue, malaria, or Japanese encephalitis. A
more appropriate analogy: a visitor to a canine rabies endemic area should
consider rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis before visiting. This decision
should be made independent of whether or not a single case of rabies has
occurred in someone bitten by a dog in that area. Sporadic cases are an
expected occurrence in an endemic area. The area remains endemic whether
or not a sporadic case has recently occurred; education and appropriate
preventive measures are indicated upon visiting any endemic area, again
independent of whether any recent cases have occurred.
In California, surveillance for plague activity in endemic areas where
tourists visit (e.g., campgrounds) is conducted routinely (the rationale
for this surveillance was questioned in a previous ProMED note when the
finding of plague in animals was reported). These are heightened at any
evidence of increased activity (animal die-off, human cases). Where
indicated plague control measures are instituted, and campgrounds may be
either closed or signs placed warning of plague activity (the choice
between these two is often controversial during peak tourist season).
I am curious what plague advice Health Canada gives to tourists visiting
the Rocky Mountains (avoid contact with wild animals?) and why this advice
needs to be hinged to the occurrence of human plague.

[It's not my rationale. An eminent panel of public health specialists
consulted by WHO decided long ago on the necessity of reporting even
sporadic cases of plague. WHO has since adopted the sensible measure of
appending to its Notifications of sporadic cases text explaining that such
cases are of no importance to international travel. It is not up to the
local health people to decide what is or is not to be reported. Health
Canada obviously feels that way too, and I hope will respond to the
question above - Mod.JW
