The number of Legionnaire's disease cases here [in Singapore] rose to 52 in
the first nine months of this year compared to an average 33 annually over
the past four years.
The Straits Times, citing figures from the Environment Ministry, reported
four deaths this year from the pneumonia-like disease while last year there
were five fatalities out of 37 cases.
The newspaper said the Environment Ministry was looking at imposing
regulations requiring checks on indoor air quality.
Studies show that most people here spend 80 per cent of their time indoors
and more are relying on air-conditioning not just at work but also at home
and when commuting.
Earlier studies by the ministry found that one in five office workers have
health problems because of poorly-ventilated buildings.
Legionnaire's disease is contracted through breathing in water droplets
infected by bacteria commonly found in the water of cooling towers in
air-conditioning systems.
Symptoms such as fever, cough, breathlessness and chest pains show two to
10 days after infection. It usually hits those over 50 whose immunity is
already weak and who may have cancer, diabetes or heart disease.
