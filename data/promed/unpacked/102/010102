[Sheep pox and goat pox are viral diseases of sheep and goats characterised by fever, generalised papules or nodules, vesicles (rarely), internal lesions (particularly in the lungs), and death. Both diseases are caused by strains of capripoxvirus. Most of the strains cause clinical disease in either sheep or goats; some strains will cause a clinical disease in both species (such as in Kenya).

Sheep pox has been regarded endemic in Israel for many years. The local virus affects -- clinically -- sheep only: when the disease affects mixed sheep and goats flocks, only sheep are clinically affected. Mortality in adult animals is generally low (less than 5 per cent) but may reach high levels in offspring.

The information on control measures as presented in the OIE report above, "no vaccination", is in need of clarification: since 2006, a new, imported vaccine has been introduced and vaccination of sheep became compulsory in Israel; this led to a sharp decrease in the number of outbreaks: 2006 - 26; 2007 - 9; 2008 - 4; 2009 - 0; 2010 - 0; 2011 - 2; 2012 - 0; 2013 - 0. A graph showing the annual number of sheep pox outbreaks in Israel for the period 1990-2012 is available on page 31 of the VSAH (Veterinary Services and Animal Health) annual report 2012, available at http://www.moag.gov.il/agri/files/doh_shnati_2012.pdf.

Vaccination history of the infected (backyard) flock described in the current OIE report, including the vaccine batch applied (in case vaccinated), will be welcome. At present, 2 sheep pox vaccines are registered and certified for use in Israel, both including strain RM65: one is manufactured locally, the other one is imported.

"Hazafon" (district) stands for "North" in the Hebrew language. The I'billin municipality (more than 12 000 citizens) is situated in the western part of the Lower Galilee; see map at http://tinyurl.com/nw9a58f. - Mod.AS
