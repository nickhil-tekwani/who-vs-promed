Coronavirus cases in Eastern Europe have surpassed 20 million, according to a Reuters tally on [Sun 24 Oct 2021], as the region grapples with its worst outbreak since the pandemic started and inoculation efforts lag.

Countries in the region have the lowest vaccination rates in Europe, with less than half of the population having received a single dose.

Hungary tops the region's vaccination rates with 62% of its population having received at least one shot, whereas Ukraine has given just 19% of its residents a single dose, according to Our World in Data.

New infections in the region have steadily risen and now average at least 83 700 new cases per day, the highest level since November last year [2020], Reuters data through [Fri 22 Oct 2021] showed. Although it has just 4% of the world's population, Eastern Europe accounts for roughly 20% of all new cases reported globally.

According to a Reuters analysis, 3 of the top 5 countries reporting the most deaths in the world are in Eastern Europe - Russia, Ukraine and Romania.

More social gathering indoors after the lifting of restrictions just as winter sets in is driving a rise in COVID-19 infections in many countries across Europe, the World Health Organization's emergency director Mike Ryan said on [Thu 21 Oct 2021].

As the wave of infections intensifies, many people in Eastern Europe are torn between defiance and regret over not getting vaccinated.

Hundreds have protested in Sofia, Bulgaria, and other cities against mandatory certificates that came into force on [Thu 21 Oct 2021], limiting access to many indoor public spaces to those who have been vaccinated.

A European Commission poll, the Eurobarometer, has shown that at least one person in 3 in most countries in the European Union's east does not trust the healthcare system, compared with a bloc average of 18%.

More than 40% of all new cases reported in Eastern Europe were in Russia, with 120 people testing positive every 5 minutes, according to a Reuters analysis. The country's healthcare system is operating under great strain, Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said on [Wed 20 Oct 2021]. The nation on [Fri 22 Oct 2021] reported record COVID fatalities for the 4th straight day.

So far, Russia has vaccinated about 36% of its population with one vaccine shot.

Moscow, the country's most populous city and capital, will next week shut down all businesses except essential stores such as supermarkets and pharmacies to stem the spread of the disease.

Slovakia reported 3480 new COVID-19 cases on [Tue 19 Oct 2021], its highest daily tally since March [2021], health ministry data showed on [Wed 20 Oct 2021]. The country has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the EU, with just over half the adult population fully inoculated in the country of 5.5 million. This has contributed to a faster rise in infections than in some neighbouring countries.

In Romania, hospitals are stretched to breaking point, with emergency beds fully occupied across the country. Morgues were also running at full capacity. The country reported record numbers of daily coronavirus fatalities and infections on [Tue 19 Oct 2021]. The virus was killing one person every 5 minutes on average this month in a country where the inoculation rate is low.

Ukraine registered a record daily high of new coronavirus infections and related deaths for the 2nd consecutive day on [Fri 22 Oct 2021]. It also extended a state of emergency that allows authorities to impose curbs until year-end in an attempt to rein in infections.

[2] China: lockdowns
Date: Mon 25 Oct 2021

https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/25/china/covid-update-intl-hnk/index.html


Authorities in northern China are reimposing lockdowns and other emergency measures to curb the spread of coronavirus, with health officials warning of a worsening outbreak after the country recorded more than 100 cases across 11 provinces over the last week.

"Since [17 Oct 2021], there have been multiple scattered local outbreaks in China, and they're expanding rapidly," Mi Feng, a spokesman at the National Health Commission (NHC), said at a news conference on [Sun 24 Oct 2021]. "There is an increasing risk that the outbreak will spread even further."

The rapid spread comes despite about 75% of China's population -- or more than a billion people -- being fully vaccinated, according to Mi.

The caseload of China's latest outbreak pales in comparison with those of some other countries, including Singapore and the United Kingdom. But the scope of its spread has worried the Chinese government, which insists on a strict zero-COVID policy to stamp out infections.

The outbreak was first detected on [16 Oct 2021] among a tour group of fully vaccinated senior citizens from Shanghai who traveled in several northern regions. Among the 133 infections reported as of [Sun 24 Oct 2021], 106 were linked to 13 tour groups, according to Mi, the NHC health official.

Infections have been reported in nearly a third of the country's provinces and regions, with all medium- and high-risk regions concentrated in Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia, Guizhou and Beijing. Authorities have banned travel agencies from organizing cross-provincial tours in these regions.

On [Sun 24 Oct 2021], the Chinese capital tightened entry restrictions into the city, requiring travelers from places with confirmed cases to present a negative coronavirus test and undergo 14 days of health monitoring.

The city has recorded 14 confirmed cases in the latest outbreak, including 12 over the past 3 days, according to a CNN tally of the Beijing Municipal Health Commission's daily reports.

A widespread COVID outbreak in Beijing would be the last thing Chinese leaders want to see as the city gears up for the 2022 Winter Olympics in February [2022]. Next month [November 2021], members of the ruling Communist Party's elite Central Committee are also due to gather in the capital for their annual meeting, which paves the way for President Xi Jinping to stay for a 3rd term in power at the party congress next fall.

Already, authorities in Beijing are making an example of 6 residents who allegedly broke COVID rules with criminal detentions. Among them, 2 went out to eat and invited friends home for mahjong despite having developed fevers upon returning from a COVID-infected tourist destination in Inner Mongolia. Another 2 tried to climb over the fences of their locked-down gated community.

The city also suspended a marathon originally scheduled for [31 Oct 2021]. It has not announced a new date for the event.

Elsewhere, the COVID response has been even more sweeping and stringent.

Ejin Banner, a city of 35 000 people in Inner Mongolia and a popular tourist destination, banned all residents and tourists from leaving their homes or hotel rooms starting [Mon 25 Oct 2021], after it recorded 12 cases on [Sun 24 Oct 2021].

The city also announced harsh punishment for 6 officials, including the director of the local health commission, for their "slack response and ineffective management" of the latest outbreak, the state-run Global Times reported Sun.

In neighboring Gansu province, the provincial capital of Lanzhou also announced measures over the weekend to "cease all tourist activities" and put visitors in quarantine.

Both cities, as well as several others in Inner Mongolia and Gansu, have suspended all trains, buses and taxi services, according to the Transportation Ministry.

[3] First responders

First responders may have higher COVID-19 risk than healthcare workers
First responders' risk for COVID-19 infection is about 60% more than other essential workers, including healthcare workers (HCWs), according to a study published late last week in JAMA Health Forum.

In Arizona, 1766 HCWs, first responders, and other essential workers took weekly COVID-19 tests from July 2020 to March 2021 (23 393 person-weeks). First responder infection incidence was 13.2 per 1000 person-weeks, versus 6.7 in HCWs and 7.4 in other essential workers. Compared with HCWs, first responders' adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) was 1.60 (95% CI, 1.07 -- 2.83), with similar results when compared with other essential workers.

Age was also an independent risk factor, according to the data, with every 10-year increase associated with a 19% reduction in risk (IRR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70 -- 0.95). This was consistent with Arizona's COVID-19 case trends during the test period.

The cohort consisted of 22.4% first responders (eg, firefighters, correctional officers, emergency medical services personnel), 44.2% HCWs, and 33.4% other essential workers (eg, teachers, operators). The median age was 43.8 years.

While 61.9% were women, the researchers noted that fewer women were first responders (37%) compared with healthcare personnel (69.7%) or other essential workers (68.3%). Household income was also distributed unevenly, with 25.0% of HCWs reporting household income of USD200 000 per year or more compared with 5.8% of first responders and 6.9% of other essential workers.

"This analysis of the AZ HEROES study data shows that we need to do more to help protect our first responders, their families and the communities they serve," said first author Kate Ellingson, PhD, in a University of Arizona press release. "Specifically, we need to better understand the risk factors driving infection among first responders and to tailor mitigation strategies accordingly, including vaccine promotion."

[Note that this study is a comparison of prevaccination incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among first responders and other essential workers with incidence among health care personnel. First responders have frequent contact with infectious people, placing them in a very vulnerable position, especially if they did not have adequate personal protective equipment as was the case early in the pandemic. But by July 2020, they should have had correct PPE.

[4] Non-COVID deaths

COVID-19 vaccine recipients had lower non-COVID death rates than those who were not vaccinated against COVID-19, according to a large study published in Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) late last week [w/e 24 Oct 2021].

The researchers used data from seven US health systems from [14 Dec 2020] to [31 Jul 2021], and matched 6.4 million COVID-vaccinated people with 4.6 million unvaccinated people. About 3.5 million people received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, 2.6 million the Moderna vaccine, and 342 169 the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, and to account for healthcare-seeking behavior, vaccinated and unvaccinated participants were included only if they had at least one dose of flu vaccine in the past 2 years.

The study involved about 11 million people total.

The adjusted relative risk (aRR) of non-COVID deaths per year was 0.41% and 0.34% after the 1st and 2nd dose of Pfizer, respectively; 0.34% and 0.31% after the 1st and 2nd dose of Moderna, respectively; and 0.54% after the single dose of Johnson & Johnson. That compares with annual rates ranging from 1.11% -- 1.47% in unvaccinated peers.

Among Pfizer recipients 12 to 17 years old, mortality risk did not differ between the vaccinated and unvaccinated cohort, which the researchers say could be due to more similar risk factors in this age-group compared with adults. The researchers also found that mortality rates among Johnson & Johnson vaccine recipients were higher than those who received an mRNA vaccine, which they say could be due to underlying health status and risk behavior differences.

"Despite numerous studies showing the safety of COVID-19 vaccines, some people have remained hesitant to get vaccinated," said lead author Stanley Xu, PhD, in a Kaiser Permanente press release. "This study provides reassurance that the vaccines are very safe, and, in fact, people who received COVID-19 vaccines in the United States had a lower death rate than those who didn't, even if you don't count COVID deaths."

"The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines require 2 doses for full vaccination, while the Johnson & Johnson adenoviral vector vaccine requires only one dose. The 1-dose and 2-dose vaccines had different comparison groups due to differences in when the vaccines were available and potential differences in the demographics of people who chose the 1- or 2-dose vaccines. All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, race, ethnicity, and Vaccine Safety Datalink site.

- Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine recipients had a mortality rate of 4.2 deaths per 1000 vaccinated people per year after 1st dose, and 3.5 deaths after 2nd dose.
The unvaccinated comparison group had a mortality rate of 11.1 deaths per 1000 people per year.

- Moderna COVID-19 vaccine recipients had 3.7 deaths per 1000 people per year after the 1st dose, and 3.4 deaths after the 2nd dose.
The unvaccinated comparison group had a mortality rate of 11.1 deaths per 1000 people per year.

- Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine recipients had 8.4 deaths per 1000 people per year.
The unvaccinated comparison group had a mortality rate of 14.7 deaths per 1000 people per year."
