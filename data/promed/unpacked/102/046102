[A 3-year rabies control program, including oral vaccination of
wildlife, was implemented in Belarus in 2001. This was followed by a
subsequent reduction of rabies cases in animals, as recorded in 2004.
It would be helpful to note whether the oral vaccination was
continued in following years; if not, the observed deterioration of
the rabies situation should not surprise. - Mod.AS]
