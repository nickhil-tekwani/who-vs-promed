Viet Nam culls more bird flu-infected poultry
-----------------------------------------------
Over 7000 ducks infected with bird flu viruses in Viet Nam's central Quang
Tri province were culled this week, according to the Viet Nam News Agency
on Wednesday [6 Jul 2005].
For the same reason, over 10 000 infected waterfowl in the province were
culled late last month [June 2005].
The country decided to cull all infected waterfowl raised on a large scale,
and to isolate areas having sick poultry bred on a small scale, in order to
prevent bird flu from spreading, since some 10 million out of 40 million
waterfowl in the country, mainly ducks, face a high risk of being infected
with bird flu viruses, including the H5N1 strain.
Additionally, Viet Nam will start vaccinating fowl in northern Nam Dinh
province and southern Tien Giang province on a trial basis early next month
[August 2005].
The Vietnamese Health Ministry has confirmed that a total of 60 local
people from the country's 23 localities have been infected with H5N1 since
late December 2004, of whom 18 have died.
