Researchers and agronomists from Hungarian institutions have joined forces in an attempt to save the country's remaining apricot trees. As elsewhere in Europe -- most notably in France -- apricot trees are threatened by a phytoplasma disease called chlorotic leafroll, or witches' broom by its popular name.

The disease has been a major concern in Hungary since the early 2000s and current research focuses on two possibilities: creating apricot trees resistant -- or at least more resistant than the current ones -- to the disease and the behavior and control of jumping plant louse, the most common vector of the disease.

As a result of the disease, the area planted to apricots has been reduced to just under 5000 hectares in the entire country.

[Chlorotic leaf roll disease of apricot is caused by _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma prunorum (CPP, 16SrX taxonomic group) which is also called European stone fruit yellows phytoplasma (ESFYP). The pathogen also affects other species of _Prunus_, such as cherry, peach, Japanese plum (_P. salicina_), almond, while others, including European plum (_P. domestica_) and some rootstock cultivars, are tolerant or resistant. Symptoms on susceptible hosts may include leaf curling, yellowing or discolouration; off-season flowering which exposes the host to frost damage; dieback of branches, necrosis of phloem, decline and eventually death of the tree. Yield may be severely reduced as fruit on affected branches may fall prematurely.

CPP is present and widespread in many central and southern European areas. It is transmitted by grafting and can be spread with budwood (both scion and rootstock) and tissue cultures, as well as by psyllid (plant louse) vectors, such as _Cacopsylla pruni_ which is widespread in parts of Europe and Asia. Asymptomatic species (such as of _Prunus_, _Rosa_, _Fraxinus_) can serve as pathogen reservoirs but their role in disease epidemiology needs further investigation. Disease management may include phytosanitation, vector control, removal of pathogen reservoirs, and use of certified clean propagation material.

Other members of the group include the apple proliferation phytoplasma (_Ca._ P. mali; type member of 16SrX) and the pear decline phytoplasma (_Ca._ P. pyri). The phytoplasmas of this group are considered the most serious pathogens of stone and pome fruits in Europe.
