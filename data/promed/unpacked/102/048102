Damage to peach crop in Swat likely
-----------------------------------
Thousands of tons of peach crop are feared to be wasted in the
Malakand division [North West Frontier Province] this season again as
mass exodus of people continues from the area. The Pakistan
Horticulture Development and Export Board (PHD&B) has said that the
peach crop is in full bloom in Swat [Valley]. But deteriorating law
and order situation in Swat has created a situation worse than last
year [2008] when thousands of tons of fruits, especially peach, were
thrown away due to weeks-long curfew.

The army has imposed curfew in Swat, Buner, and Lower Dir, and
intermittently relaxes it for short intervals to allow civilians to
flee the areas. Most of the orchards thus remain unattended. "Most
orchards have not been pruned yet, which is one of the most important
management practices for peach," the PHD&B says.

But even before the start of the army operation, rains had already
damaged some of the peach crop. Non-availability of fertiliser has
also been a problem for the area during the last few months.

"It is expected that the crop situation will not be satisfactory this
year [2009] as peach leaf curl has also been reported in some
orchards [in Swat]," the PHD&B observes. Peach leaf curl is one of
the most damaging diseases which has been caused by recent rains and
unexpected cold weather in Swat and surrounding areas. If not
properly controlled at appropriate time, the disease is feared to
damage the crop further as rains are still expected in the area this month.

[Peach leaf curl disease is caused by the fungus _Taphrina
deformans_, which can also infect nectarine and cherry. The disease
is common in unsprayed orchards. Symptoms include distortion,
thickening, and discolouration of leaves; infected leaves and fruit
drop prematurely; and infected twigs are swollen and stunted, usually
with deformed leaves at their tips. Severely defoliated trees produce
fewer fruit and are more vulnerable to winter damage and
opportunistic diseases.

Spores are spread by wind and water and can remain dormant in bark
crevices for several years. They germinate during rainy periods in
spring, and only young tissue is susceptible to infection. Thus in
years when rains and bud break do not coincide, the spores remain
inactive and little or no infection occurs. This may lead to a
periodic pattern of the appearance of leaf curl. Disease management
relies on fungicides applied at the dormant stage. If this time is
missed, as in the situation reported above, fungicide applications
after bud break are ineffective in controlling the disease.
