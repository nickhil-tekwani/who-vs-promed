The Ministry of Public Health has announced that Thailand's 1st case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) has been confirmed, adding that 59 other people close to the patient have been put under close monitoring.

At a press conference, Minister of Public Health Dr Rajata Rajatanavin disclosed that the patient found with the 1st case of MERS infection in Thailand is a Middle Eastern man, aged 75, who traveled to Thailand from a Middle Eastern country on [15 Jun 2015]. The patient reportedly did not have any fever but only experienced a cough after arriving at Suvarnabhumi Airport. He later sought medical attention for his heart problem at a private hospital before being suspected of MERS.

The patient has been transferred to Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute, where he is now receiving treatment in a separate quarantine unit. His condition is currently stable. According to the Public Health Minister, samples collected from the patient were subjected to repeat testing and all the results were positive for MERS.

A total of 59 people who are related to the man or have come into contact with him have been reached by the Public Health Ministry. Among the individuals are 3 family members who have also been invited to receive close attention at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute. The others, comprising passengers and crew members on board the same aircraft, medical staff and taxi drivers, will be contacted by authorities on a daily basis and asked about their condition.

The Public Health Minister also encouraged the public to remain calm, as the infected and all suspected persons are being kept in seclusion and the situation is still under control. He suggested everyone to strictly adhere to sanitary practices during this period and refrain from traveling to the Middle East and South Korea, where MERS outbreaks are taking place.

The Public health Ministry Thursday [18 Jun 2015] confirmed the 1st MERS case in Thailand after laboratory test determined that a foreign visitor had contracted the deadly virus, according to Dr Prasert Thongcharoen, the ministry's senior adviser.

Prasert, who is also chairman of Thailand's expert panel on virulogy and epidemics, said the patient is understood to have contracted Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in a foreign country.

The unnamed patient then visited Thailand and was diagnosed. The patient is reportedly 75 years old and has had contacts with 59 persons since becoming infected.

Earlier, there were rumours of MERS cases in Roi-Et and other places in Thailand, but health authorities dismissed them as groundless.

Meanwhile, the Public Health Ministry has stepped up its surveillance of suspected MERS cases and held a teleconference with all provincial health authorities nationwide yesterday to beef up measures in response to the possible spread of MERS.

So far, the authorities have focussed on people who were potentially exposed to the disease, especially those who have recently been in at-risk countries such as South Korea and Middle Eastern nations.

Dr Opas Karnkavinpong, deputy director-general of the Disease Control Department, said the surveillance system had been strictly enforced and all potential victims had undergone laboratory tests and those results would be known within 1 day.

Thailand has confirmed its 1st known case of the deadly MERS virus, after a man who arrived from a Middle Eastern country was treated for a heart condition.

Public Health Minister Rajata Rajatanavin said on Thursday [18 Jun 2015] that 2 laboratories had confirmed the results.

He said the 75-year-old man has been quarantined at Bamrasbaradura Infectious Diseases Institute in Nonthaburi province.

Mr Rajata said the patient was travelling with 3 family members who are being monitored at the facility.

The Public Health Ministry said 59 others are being monitored. They were in contact with the man, including nearby passengers on the airplane and a taxi driver.

People from the Middle East frequently come to Thailand for medical treatment.

An outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome has killed 23 people and sickened more than 160 in South Korea. Around the world, related deaths have been put at 458.

Thailand confirms 1st MERS case: Health ministry
-------------
Thailand confirmed its 1st case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) on Thursday [18 Jun 2015], becoming the 4th Asian country to register the deadly virus this year [2015].

Public Health Minister Rajata Rajatanavin told a news conference that a 75-year-old businessman from Oman had tested positive for [MERS-CoV].

"From 2 lab tests we can confirm that the MERS virus was found," Dr Rajata said, adding the man had travelled to Bangkok for medical treatment for a heart condition. "The 1st day he came he was checked for the virus. The patient ... contracted the MERS virus."

The health minister said 59 others were being monitored for the virus, including 3 of the man's relatives who travelled with him to Bangkok.

MERS is caused by a coronavirus from the same family as the one that triggered China's deadly 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

The vast majority of MERS infections and deaths have been in Saudi Arabia, where more than 1000 people have been infected since 2012, and about 454 have died.

Last month, a MERS outbreak erupted in South Korea resulting in 23 deaths so far. A total of 165 people have been infected and 6700 people are in quarantine.

But there have been signs that the outbreak, the largest outside of Saudi Arabia, may be slowing in South Korea. The daily number of new cases has dropped to single digits this week compared to as many as 23 last week. 3 were reported on Thursday [18 Jun 2015] - the lowest number since [1 Jun 2015].

All of the infections known to have occurred in South Korea have taken place in healthcare facilities. 3 hospitals have been at least partially shut and 2 have been locked down with patients and medical staff inside.

China and the Philippines have also reported 1 MERS case in 2015.

Earlier, Thailand's Disease Control Department said it was screening travellers at 67 points of entry.

"We are checking 67 ports including land, sea and air," said Dr Sophon Mekthon, secretary-general of Thailand's Disease Control Department. "We've told all hospitals in Thailand to be on alert. Those who come back from the Middle East and South Korea must be checked thoroughly."

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Mary Ann Benitez <mary.benitez@singtaonewscorp.com> for submitting a similar media report on this 1st case reported from Thailand.

This series of reports is presented in reverse chronologic order of appearance on the internet, i.e., [1] is the most recent and [4] is the earliest. One can see how the information dissemination is unfolding in this "story". Of interest is that the earliest report [4] mentions the country of origin of the case, whereas the official government report does not mention the country of origin -- just "a Middle Eastern country".

Another media report mentioned that the 1st test performed on this individual was negative, but the follow-up test was positive. It is curious that media reports on the outbreak of MERS-CoV currently ongoing in Korea frequently state that early tests on individuals have been negative. One wonders at what stage of infection the testing becomes positive -- does it correlate more closely with clinical expression of disease, or with the number of days following exposure, irrespective of clinical disease? Presumably patients are not highly infectious if evidence of the virus is not present in respiratory tract specimens.

According to the official Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) press release, the individual was afebrile but had a cough, and was tested for possible MERS-CoV infection based on the history of cough. An early symptom of infection, and in this case, a "good catch" vis a vis early confirmation of diagnosis with resultant early isolation, infection control measures, and monitoring of known contacts. More information on this case would be greatly appreciated, especially history of possible known high-risk exposures in the 14 days preceding either onset of clinical illness or positive test.

Working on the premise from the early media reports that Oman was the country of origin of this case, as of 12 Jun 2015 there had been 6 cases of MERS-CoV infection including 3 deaths reported by Oman (for the global update on MERS-CoV produced by ECDC weekly, see http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/communicable-disease-threats-report-13-june-2015.pdf. Given the studies demonstrating high prevalence of antibodies against MERS-CoV in Omani camels in the past, it is curious that there have been so few cases of MERS-CoV infection confirmed in Omani individuals.

Revisiting the most recent reported case from Oman, I was struck by the following description in the WHO report on the case: "A 75-year-old male from Al Dahir village developed symptoms on 11 May [2015] and was admitted to hospital on 19 May [2015]. He was treated symptomatically and discharged on 20 May [2015]. As symptoms worsened, on 25 May [2015], the patient was admitted to the same hospital. He tested positive for MERS-CoV on 29 May [2015]." (see MERS-CoV (56): South Korea, China, Saudi Arabia, Oman, WHO 20150605.3413986 and 31 May 2015 MERS-CoV (52): Oman, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, WHO, RFI 20150531.3399248 for the initial MOH report and the WHO report). In the above description it mentions onset of illness on 11 May 2015 and confirmation on 25 May 2015, with hospitalization 19-20 May 2015. The question that comes to mind now is: Was the 1st hospitalization for early MERS-CoV symptoms that were lab negative for the virus? -- or perhaps lab testing for the virus wasn't done because the presentation was mild -- or did the man have another respiratory illness for which he was hospitalized, and was exposed to the MERS-CoV while in the hospital (exposed to an undiagnosed case)? Food for thought here...

The critical question now is whether there will be secondary cases of MERS-CoV in Thailand related to exposure to this case or if it will be a single "sporadic" case. We might expect to have cases among the 3 family members who traveled with him and were presumably close contacts. The next 2 weeks will determine.

The Bamrasbaradura Infectious Diseases Hospital is located in central Nonthaburi province. (http://www.aa.com.tr/en/health/540081--first-case-of-mers-reported-in-thailand). Nonthaburi province is near Bangkok, to the northwest (see http://www.weather-forecast.com/locations/Nonthaburi for map showing location). The Ministry of Public Health is located in Nonthaburi province.
