Pennsylvania Agriculture Secretary Samuel E. Hayes Jr. today announced that
Plum Pox Virus (PPV) has been detected on a fruit farm in Adams County.
"If not contained, this plant virus has the potential to cause severe
damage to Pennsylvania's stone fruit industry," Secretary Hayes said. Both
state and federal agriculture officials are working to contain the virus.
"The area will be placed under quarantine, so it will be illegal to move
stone fruit trees or budwood from the quarantine area. Action will include
destruction of infected trees."
Inspectors with the department's Bureau of Plant Industry and the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
(APHIS) currently are surveying farms in the affected area to determine the
extent of infection.
PPV affects stone-bearing fruits, including plums, peaches, nectarines,
apricots and cherries. It is characterized by round spots (pox) on fruit,
leaves, stems and seeds. It does not kill trees, but makes fruit
unmarketable and drastically decreases yields. PPV is transmitted from
infected trees by aphids or by grafting or budding. The strain detected in
Pennsylvania is not transmitted in seed. The disease does not affect humans.
First described in Eastern Europe in 1910, PPV has spread to most countries
on the European continent and to at least one country in South America.
This is the first time PPV has been detected in North America.
Pennsylvania is a leading producer of fruit, ranking fourth nationally in
peaches; fifth in tart cherries; and seventh in sweet cherries. Adams
County is Pennsylvania's leading fruit-producing county.
In 1998, the value of Pennsylvania's stone fruit production was
approximately $25 million.

Industry at 717-772-5203.

[When PPV was reported in the Western Hemisphere (Chile) in 1996, it was
predicted that the disease would reach North America in 20 years.
According to a USDA press release on 20 October 1999, the isolate of the
virus found in Pennsylvania belongs to the D strain which occurs in western
Europe, is less aggressive than other PPV strains, and is not
seed-transmitted. A complicating factor in surveying for affected trees in
Pennsylvania is the usual color change in the fall which will make it
difficult to recognize typical leaf symptoms of the disease. Plans for
surveying in the spring of 2000 are in progress. - Mod.DH]
