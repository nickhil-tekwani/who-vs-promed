Since Monday 21 Jun 1999 nine cases of measles were notified to the Public
Health Service Zuid-Oost Utrecht in the Netherlands. All children are from
a reformist church primary school where more than half of parents decline
vaccinations [for their children on religious grounds.
Investigation revealed that of the 391 pupils 80 were ill at home. In 42
cases the parents reported that their child suffered from measles, in the
other 38 cases measles was considered possible.
Measles is not unusual in a school like this. As the last previous reported
large cluster in the Netherlands was in 1991 and as 1988 was the last
epidemic year, it is possible that by now this population has sufficiant
susceptible children to make another epidemic possible. GPs in a wide area
have been informed and an enhanced surveillance system has been set up.
The geographical area where this population lives and where the vaccination
coverage is lees than 90% is known as the bible belt, and streches from the
north
east to the south west of the country. There is up to today 26 June no
indication that the virus has spread outside the school, not to other
people in the index-village, nor to other areas in the bible belt.
The RIVM (national public health laboratory) performed PCR on material
(blood, throat smear) of 7 cases and found a positive signal in all.
Typing is in process.

[Measles is not an emerging disease, but a disappearing one. However,
parents who refuse vaccination for their children are helping to keep it
alive - Mod.JW
