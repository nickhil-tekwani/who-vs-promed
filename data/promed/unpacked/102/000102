Almost 20% of tur crop (pigeon pea) has been destroyed in Yavatmal district, one of the largest producers of the commodity in the country, [which has sowed] 150 000 hectares [370 658 acres] [of pigeon pea] this year [2018]. The fungus, _Fusarium udum_, is causing wilting of the crop. Not much can be done to save the crop.

Treating seeds by applying fungicides can prevent damage to crops. "However, private seed companies supply untreated seeds to a majority of farmers. This has been going on for years," [a farmer] said.

If tur is continuously grown year after year, the crop becomes very susceptible. Farmers [also] grow susceptible varieties without being aware of it. Farmers must follow crop rotation so that soil quality is maintained. As a bioagent, Trichoderma fungus is used for seed treatment.

While scientists can explain about the disease, they have no data on the actual damage and the areas affected. Information could not be substantiated, as all agriculture department officials in the district were busy in a sports meet.

[Pigeon pea (_Cajanus cajan_) is a woody legume and an important crop grown widely in tropical and subtropical regions. Fungal wilt due to _Fusarium udum_ is considered to be one of the major diseases of the crop worldwide, but the pathogen appears to be specific to _C. cajanus_. Yield losses of 30-100% have been reported (e.g., from India). Symptoms may include wilting of foliage, interveinal yellowing and drying of leaves, necrosis on roots, browning of xylem vessels, and purple or black streaks along the stem surface. Individual plants may be completely or partially affected and are often found in patches within fields. Disease severity depends on host cultivar, soil type, and time of infection in the plant's growth cycle.

The fungus is soil borne and can survive for long periods of time as a saprophyte on dead roots of host plants. It is also spread with seeds, crop debris, water, and human activities (e.g., on farm machinery and tools). Disease management requires an integrated approach, including crop rotation and phytosanitary measures to avoid spread to new fields. Breeding programmes are developing pigeon pea varieties with resistance or reduced sensitivity to fusarium wilt.

Antagonistic fungi in the genus _Trichoderma_ (as mentioned in the report above) have been shown to be effective as biocontrol organisms to suppress various fungal pathogens including soil-inhabiting species (for example, ProMED-mail posts 20160317.4102576, 20151109.3779551, and 20130805.1864259). They are used as foliar applications as well as seed and soil treatments.

Other _Fusarium_ species cause or are associated with wilt diseases on a range of crops, including lettuce, sweet potato, cashew, guava, and melon (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives).
