London - New Scientist magazine carried an article stating that sterilizing
surgical instruments infected with the human equivalent of mad cow disease
[new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, nvCJD could help to spread the
deadly brain wasting disorder. The article added, "David Taylor of the
Institute for Animal Health in Edinburgh found increasing the temperature of
the autoclave (sterilizer) actually made it harder to destroy CJD prions."
In Britain, the standard temperature range for autoclaving instruments is
134 to 138 *C [273.2 Fahrenheit to 280.4 Fahrenheit. Taylor believes the
slightly higher temperature "fixed" the prion, allowing chemical links to
form that made the molecules more stable. He is preparing his results for
publication.
Fears about spreading nvCJD through contaminated surgery instruments arose
in January after scientists developed a diagnostic test for the disease
based on tissue samples from tonsils. The test involves removal of tonsil
tissue to be analyzed for a mutated prion protein, the infectious agent that
causes nvCJD. The research showed nvCJD infection is in the lymph tissues,
not just in the central nervous system, and could be spread through medical
or surgical procedures. It prompted calls for surgeons to use disposable
instruments.
Taylor used infected tissue samples and heated them at 134 degrees Celsius
(273.2 Fahrenheit) for 9, 18 and 30 minutes. The samples were not
infectious. But when he reheated them at 138 degrees Celsius (280.4
Fahrenheit) they were infectious.

[The last paragraph is unclear. Were the samples not infectious before the
heating? Why does re-heating make them infectious? How was the infectivity
of the tissues determined? If there is further information available, we
would appreciate it. Mod.-TG

There is no indication of where the research is published and it is not yet
on Medline.
