Rift Valley Fever under control
-------------------------------
The contagious Rift Valley Fever in KwaZulu-Natal's Creighton farm
area was under control, Agriculture and Environmental Affairs MEC
Mtholephi Mthimkhulu said on Tuesday [3 Mar 2009]. "We sent people to
Creighton to put the disease under control. We are also working
towards getting a vaccine to ensure that it does not spread."

According to the World Health Organisation, Rift Valley Fever (RVF)
is a viral zoonosis that primarily affects animals but also has the
capacity to infect humans. Infection can cause severe disease in both
animals and humans, leading to high rates of death.

Unconfirmed reports on Tuesday stated that more than 50 animals had
died in Creighton since the outbreak was picked up. Mthimkhulu said
there was no need to start pressing alarm bells, saying that there
were no signs the disease was spreading.

The majority of human RVF infections resulted from direct or indirect
contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. The virus can
be transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during
slaughtering.

"When we heard about the disease, I urgently summoned our Veterinary
Services Unit (VSU) to put together an urgent plan of action to
handle this matter," said Mthimkhulu. He said a joint task team
comprising government, organised agricultural unions (KwaNalu and
Nafu) and community based organisations had been put in place to
develop a comprehensive plan of action.
