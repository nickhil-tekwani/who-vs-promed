A group of 3 doctors and a few paramedical personnel equipped with
life-saving medicines and saline drips today [23 Jan 2010] moved out
of the state hospital at the block headquarters town of Lala to set
up medical camps at Kundanala and Nunai villages where an unknown
fever has claimed the lives of 5 tribals in 12 days; 4 of the dead
were women. The Reang-inhabited villages are nearly 40 km [25 miles]
from Hailakandi town.

Hailakandi Deputy Commissioner T.C. Goswami today [23 Jan 2010] said
over phone that he had instructed the joint director of health
services in the district headquarters town to arrange the despatch of
the team of doctors and paramedical staff besides consignments of
medicines to the affected places under Lala block town under
Katlicherra Assembly constituency in the district on its boundary with Mizoram.

High fever accompanied by inflammations on the body of the victims
and severe pain were the symptoms, Goswami said, adding the virus was
yet to be properly diagnosed.

The in-charge of the Lala primary hospital, Jayanta Das, denied that
the villagers had died of malaria. He said Jahidul Islam, who is
heading the team of 3 doctors, had been specially instructed to
collect blood samples of the tribals afflicted with the "mystery
disease" for proper diagnosis at Silchar Medical College and Hospital.

The 5 who had died over the past 12 days in the Reang-inhabited
villages are individuals, 32, 38, 40, 50 and 55 years of age. Except
one who belonged to Channighat village, the rest were from Kundanala,
official sources in Hailakandi town said today.

Sources said a woman was 1st treated at the civil hospital in
Hailakandi from where she was shifted to Silchar Medical College and
Hospital. She died there on 17 Jan 2010. Her ailment could not be
diagnosed at the medical college hospital as no blood culture was
conducted there.

At least 20 Reang tribals, with high fever, are battling for life in
Durgapur, Bander-cherra, Yakubnala and Lalch-erra villages near Nunai.

The president of the District Tribal Sangha, Ramendra Reang, had
demanded a mini-hospital and quick economic development in the Reang
enclaves of Lala block.

[Given the non-specific symptoms of these cases, it is difficult to
make a definitive diagnosis. The Deputy Commissioner T.C. Goswami is
quoted as saying that the etiologic agent is a virus. No evidence is
provided to support that general diagnosis. Since this area is
adjacent to Bangladesh and part of that broad plain, Nipah virus
might be suspected, as this virus has been a problem in Bangladesh in
recent years. Falciparum malaria and leptospirosis should be ruled
out as well, although the physician in charge of the Lala hospital
indicated that malaria was not involved. ProMED awaits further
information with interest.
