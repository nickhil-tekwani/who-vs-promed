Two inhabitants of the village of Orke in the Zhapalak district of Osh
region have been admitted to hospital with suspicion of anthrax. Aychurek
Keldibekova, the senior epidemiologist of the city center of State
Sanitary-epidemiological supervision has reported that following laboratory
investigations the preliminary diagnosis has been confirmed.
According to the physicians treating these patients, as of [19 Sep 2007],
there is no danger for their lives. But the physicians are afraid that the
number of ill persons may increase, as [that the incubation] period is 14
days. In this regard, epidemiologists and veterinarians are working to
prevent further human cases of this disease. Persons who have had probable
contacts with these patients are also under medical supervision. [Strange
as this is not a contagious disease. - Mod.MHJ]
According to the epidemiologists, this is the 1st case of [human] anthrax
in the territory of Osh in the past 10 years. As of [19 Sep 2007], there
are 16 old foci of anthrax, 2 of which remained under constructions. For
the remaining foci, prophylactic measures are carried out every spring and
fall. [This involves taking soil samples. - Mod.MHJ] Specialists are wary,
as it was exactly at this place 10 years ago that the last cases of [human]
anthrax were recorded.

[According to the Press-UZ News Agency report of 21 Sep 2007 (see
<http://www.press-uz.info/ru/content.scm?topicId=2803&contentId=116043>, in
Russian), one person took part in the necessary [?] slaughter of 3 cattle
in a private farm belonging to an inhabitant of the village of Orke. After
slaughter, part of the meat was distributed among inhabitants of the
village and another part was given for sale in a meat shop in Osh. Duration
between these hospitalizations is 4 days. There are no epidemiological data
in the message about any other persons. - Mod.NP
While there may not have been any human cases reported latterly in Osh,
there have been livestock cases there and recently, and in the adjoining
Uzbek province. That whole neck of farmland is awash in anthrax,
unfortunately. It is not simple for a number of reasons. Firstly, though
the Kyrgyz are expert livestock owners and their stock are closely watched,
it is all done without fences and the usual corrals and shutes that we take
for granted in North America. Therefore any stock manipulation is
difficult, including routine vaccinations.
Secondly, funding to the livestock service stops short of being effective,
such as an absence of vehicles and fuel.
Thirdly, because funding is so poor, they have extreme difficulty getting
any veterinarians to work in rural areas. All of which begins to explain
why human cases are reported more often than livestock cases. This is not
unique to Kyrgyzstan, but extends throughout Central Asia and Russia. - Mod.MHJ
