[Moderator's comment: Please note that there is no epidemic of Nipah virus,
no cases of Nipah virus, no confirmed infections with Nipah virus in pigs
in Malaysia or anywhere else. The lack of adequate explanation of the
surveillance methods plus the slaughtering of pigs with antibody seems to
have aroused pig farmers. The science, politics, and poor communications
seem to be a powerful mixture. - Mod.CHC

Members of the Kuching-Samarahan Divisions Livestock Breeders Association
pigs sub-committee will hold a meeting on the recent reported outbreak of
Nipah virus in some of the State's pig farms.
Its chairman Dr Ng Siew Thiam, when contacted yesterday, said its members
who were mostly pig breeders would discuss matters pertaining to the
current situation and the latest development. "We will also confer on what
we need to do. Basically, we have no details of the situation or the
results of the tests conducted by the State Veterinary Department," he
added.
He revealed that the price of live pigs had so far remained normal at RM6
per kilogramme despite the slight dip in demand for the meat. Dr Ng said
for now, they would leave it to the government to confirm whether the blood
samples taken from pigs from the suspected farms actually contained the
Nipah virus.
Assistant Minister of Environment and Public Health Datuk David Teng Lung
Chi had said on Monday that results of blood samples sent for serum
neutralisation tests in Australia would only be available in about two
weeks' time. The outcome would determine whether the pigs at those farms
were infected [sic: are or had been infected at some time in the past -
Mod.CHC with the virus or not.
Last week, Datuk Teng had predicted that pork shortage in the State would
be over by August this year since there would be ample supply of the meat
by then. The 30% monthly shortage, he explained, was due to the closure of
more than 20 pig farms as a result of the Nipah virus scare last year.

Fifteen pig farms have been quarantined from today after initial tests by
the Veterinary Research Institute showed animals there might carry the
Nipah virus which claimed over 100 lives 2 years ago. Veterinary Services
Department director-general Dr Mohd Nordin Mohd Nor said the farms were
from Perak (4), Penang (5), Selangor (2), Malacca (3) and Kedah (1) which
have over 19 000 pigs.

slaughtering is or will be extended. - Mod.CHC
