YERSINIOSIS (PSEUDOTUBERCULOSIS), MONKEYS (4)
============================================
Pseudotuberculosis is also a frequent cause of death among monkeys in France.
In several cases, a treatment with fluoroquinilones has been very effective
and has saved the life of different monkeys in zoos. I would strongly
advise you to use this antibiotic as soon as there is any suspicion of
infection with Y. pseudotuberculosis.
Do not hesitate to contact me if you need additional information
