Relatively few North American migratory birds travel as far south as
Argentina; thus, none of the pigeons or any other species in the family
_Columbidae_, none of the thrushes or any other species in the family
_Turdidae_, and none of the cardinals or any other species in the family
_Cardinalidae_ of North American origin winter in Argentina. The reference
to the fieldfare (a thrush of the _Turdidae_ family that breeds in the
northern palearctic and winters to north Africa) is puzzling. It is
obviously a reference to some other totally different species.

No, none of these birds is likely to be a North American migrant. Very few
landbirds from here migrate that far south.

We would need more than "cardinals, thrushes" to give a definitive answer.
Fieldfares are found in England and Europe, except for vagrants that might
make it to North America occasionally. In fact, it is surprising to read
about any number of fieldfares in Argentina, so I wonder if someone is
using the common name of _Turdus pilaris_ to describe some other thrush
(since the list also refers to thrushes) or perhaps they were introduced?
It is unlikely that a large number of birds are recently-arrived migrants.
The pigeons are highly unlikely to be migrants. The range of northern
cardinal (_Cardinal cardinalis_) does not, I believe, extend below southern
Mexico. The Brazilian cardinal (_Paroaria coronata_) is found across
northern South America and south to Uruguay.
Occasional vagrants are found in the southern US. Migrants from North
America to Argentina include several shorebird species, Swainson's hawk,
nighthawks, barn swallows, and Swainson's thrush (_Catharus ustulatus_).
Could a bird with West Nile virus (WNV) infection successfully migrate such
a long distance? Or any distance? What would seem more plausible, if WNV
has reached Argentina, is either long-distance transport of infected
mosquitos or mosquito larva via ship or plane (perhaps in cargo), the
arrival of the disease via an infected human (bit by a mosquito in
Argentina), or the spread from North America to birds in Mexico and south,
both through contact among resident species with overlapping or adjacent
ranges or perhaps through migratory birds. But jumping to Argentina,
without an intermediate geographical distribution, seems unlikely.

I find it surprising that another ornithologist made the comment that WNV
might arrive in Argentina (or anywhere for that matter) via an infected human.
It is quite unlikely that this would occur, since humans, like horses (for
the most part), are incidental hosts. Yet I see this statement made in
informational publications, by scientists, and mentioned in the popular
media quite often, and it baffles me.
In addition, it is plausible (and in fact believed by many) that a bird
infected with WNV would and could migrate through its normal migration
range. Several species of birds that might become infected with WNV are
capable of migrating, because incubation times vary from species to
species, and viremia levels vary from bird to bird.

Concerning the Argentine bird deaths, as the [ProMED-mail authors] note, it
seems unlikely that any of the species mentioned are migrants directly
involved in spreading the virus from North America to South America.
However, this overlooks the more likely scenario in which migrants spread
the virus to South America and then the virus appears, potentially, in both
resident and migratory bird fauna. That said, it seems likely that this is
not a set of bird species likely to be indicative of a West Nile outbreak
(pigeons, for instance, are not known for their WNV susceptibility, nor are
cardinals; red-crested cardinal and yellow-billed cardinal are, I believe,
non-migratory species present in Argentina) and [the reported deaths] seem
more likely to be due to pesticide exposure.
If bird mortalities continue, then perhaps there would be greater concern
over WNV as the causative agent?

whom we extend our thanks, as well as to her list members. This would
suggest that once WNV reaches South America, the WNV in North America will
mutate over time into a distinct regional series totally separate from the
daughter group in the southern cone of South America -- different birds,
different ecology, etc. Between these two major groupings will be a stew of
viruses in the Pantanal, Bolivian Llanos, Amazon Basin,
Venezuelan/Colombian llanos, Caribbean, and Central America, all of which
will be affected each winter (December in the north, June in the south) by
regionally migrating birds entering and leaving, as well as the year-round
residents in these jungles and llanos. This should be very interesting and
a good excuse for doctoral students to get some field experience. - Mod.MHJ]
