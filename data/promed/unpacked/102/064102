[The report above indicates the numbers of suspected cases without specifying how many were fatal. The small numbers of cases scattered geographically indicate that these were most likely sylvan (jungle or forest) cases from wild primates to mosquitoes and then to people, and not urban transmission from human to mosquito to human, with the possible exception of Kano state if the 12 cases occurred in one locality. Unless the situation has changed recently, Nigeria is at risk for yellow fever outbreaks because it is the only country among 13 in West Africa yet to conduct mass vaccination as was indicated in a ProMED-mail post of 24 Oct 2012 (archive no. 20121026.1366454). A recent problem in Nigeria has been the sale of fake yellow fever vaccination cards, which would complicate matters should an outbreak occur.
