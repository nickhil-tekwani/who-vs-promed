At least 40 cows and goats have been killed due to an outbreak of a mysterious disease in Toda Cheena area of Central Kurram Agency [Federally Administered Tribal Areas].

Residents of the small village say every house has been affected due to the disease. A local resident told TNN that his 3 cows expired during the last one week. He said this disease affects healthy cattle within a day or 2 and kills them.

The area people said the disease has killed 30 cows and 13 goats in the village so far. They demanded the government send doctors for vaccination of cattle in the area.

Veterinary physician Inzar Gul told TNN that from the symptoms it seems the cattle have been affected from anthrax disease. However, he said it could be verified only after tests.

From colleagues working in the country I am informed that livestock anthrax is common in northwestern Pakistan (Kurram Agency, North Waziristan, Frontier Region Kohat, and Orakzai Agency in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and Kohat district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, previously called North-West Frontier Province). Latterly reports to Paris of any bovine outbreaks only started in 2007, and as "+" or disease present; in the previous decade there were erratic reports of anthrax outbreaks in sheep and goats but none affecting cattle. The latest report to OIE Paris was for 2014 and merely stated that the disease was present in the country. Some guidance may be available from the fact that they vaccinated 1 percent of their 96 million sheep and goats but none of their 40 million cattle. - Mod.MHJ]
