New bird flu cases discovered in Thailand
---------------------------------------------
New cases of avian influenza have been detected in Thailand's central
Suphanburi province, as the country prepares to declare itself free
of the disease on Tuesday [12 Jul 2005].
Bird flu outbreaks have been confirmed at 5 spots in Suphanburi's Sam
Chuk district, where more than 450 fowl have been destroyed, said
Nirandorn Uangtrakoolsuk, head of the Disease Control and Veterinary
Service Bureau of the Livestock Department.
Movements of fowl have been banned within a 10 km radius around the
area, and necessary measures have been put in place to control the
outbreak.
"We are going to determine the cause of the fresh round of bird flu
infection," he was quoted by The Nation as saying.
The department was also checking on whether bird flu is the cause for
recent deaths of large numbers of fowl in 6 other provinces.
Before the detection of the fresh bird flu case, the Agriculture
Ministry had planned to declare the country "bird flu-free" on
Tuesday [12 Jul 2005], 90 days after the last recorded bird flu case
in Lopburi province.
Since the infection was limited to small locations, the latest
outbreak was unlikely to expand into a large crisis, said Nirandorn.
He called on farmers to report immediately any case of fowl death to
the authorities and suggested disinfectant spray be used to protect
their farms.

Fresh cases of bird flu detected
---------------------------------
The Livestock Development Department has detected new cases of avian
influenza in Suphan Buri, effectively shattering the country's hope
of declaring itself "bird flu-free" tomorrow [12 Jul 2005] and to
boost poultry exports in the latter half of this year.
Checks are now taking place to determine whether bird flu has been
the cause of the large number of deaths of fowl in 6 other provinces.
Nirandorn Uangtrakoolsuk, who heads the department's Disease Control
and Veterinary Service Bureau, yesterday [10 Jul 2005] confirmed that
bird-flu outbreaks had been detected at 5 spots in Suphan Buri's Sam
Chuk district.
Consequently, more than 450 fowl in the area have been destroyed, and
a ban on the movement of fowl within a 10 km radius has been imposed.
"We are going to determine the cause of this fresh round of bird-flu
infections," Nirandorn said. He was confident the latest outbreak was
unlikely to spiral into a serious crisis, because the infections were
limited to small locations. He said the necessary measures had been
put in place to control the outbreaks, including disinfecting the
areas involved.
Nirandorn called on farmers to help the authorities by immediately
alerting relevant officials to any cases of fowl dying en masse.
"Don't wait a few days before you report it," he said.
His additional advice to farmers was that they should use
disinfectant spray to protect their farms, as well as any equipment
used to raise their fowl, and to stop allowing their fowl to roam
freely, as they could catch the disease from wild birds.
Nirandorn said the department was checking on whether the mass deaths
of fowl in Pathum Thani, Chachoengsao, Prachin Buri, Kalasin, Lampang
and Phetchabun recently were also related to bird flu. "We are now
waiting for the results of lab tests," he said.
He said that before this latest round of bird-flu infections,
Agriculture Minister Sudarat Keyuraphan had planned to declare the
country "bird-flu-free" tomorrow [12 Jul 2005], 90 days after the
last recorded case in Lop Buri 3 months ago. "But now, we have to
start from day one again," he said.
Nirandorn said the Agriculture Ministry would also have to shelve its
campaign to promote fresh chicken from Thailand. The campaign was
initially expected to boost the country's poultry exports in the
latter half of this year [2005].
Meanwhile, the Livestock Development Department's director-general,
Yukol Limlamthong, said he was especially concerned about the
situation in 9 provinces where bird-flu outbreaks were previously
reported. These provinces include Suphan Buri, Phitsanulok, Lop Buri,
Chai Nat and Nakhon Sawan.

[If H5N1 HPAI is confirmed by the lab, this might indeed mean a grave
drawback to Thailand, which has tried hard to regain its status as a
country free of HPAI without vaccination in order to renew the
exports of poultry products, destined mainly for Japan and the EU.
Cases of avian influenza may occur year round, but there is a
seasonal pattern, since the survival and the viability of influenza A
virus are known to increase at lower environmental temperatures. Such
an upsurge is expected towards summer's end. For instance, since
2001, H5N1 viruses have continued to circulate in mainland China with
a seasonal pattern, peaking from October to March, when the mean
temperature is below 20 C. See Li, Guan et al, 2004: "Genesis of a
highly pathogenic and potentially pandemic H5N1 influenza virus in
eastern Asia," Nature 430, 209-213. - Mod.AS]
