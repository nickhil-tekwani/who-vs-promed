Dr. Zabel and his colleagues are developing plans to burn plots of National Park Service land in Arkansas and Colorado. If the experiments turn out as the researchers hope, they will spare some elk and deer a gruesome death.

Across a growing swath of North America, these animals are dying from a mysterious disorder called chronic wasting disease. It's caused not by a virus or bacterium, but a deformed protein called a prion.

When ingested, prions force normal proteins in the animal's body to become deformed as well. Over the course of months, the multiplying prions can gradually wreck the animal's nervous system, ultimately killing it.

This year is the 50th anniversary of the discovery of chronic wasting disease. In the September issue of Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews, Dr. Zabel, an immunologist at Colorado State University, and his former graduate student Aimee Ortega survey what scientists have learned about the slow-spreading plague.

Summary
-------
"Chronic wasting disease (CWD) affects cervids and is the only known prion disease readily transmitted among free-ranging wild animal populations in nature. The increasing spread and prevalence of CWD among cervid populations threaten the survival of deer and elk herds in North America, and potentially beyond. This review focuses on prion ecology, specifically that of CWD, and the current understanding of the role that the environment may play in disease propagation. We recount the discovery of CWD, discuss the role of the environment in indirect CWD transmission, and consider potentially relevant environmental reservoirs and vectors. We conclude by discussing how understanding the environmental persistence of CWD lends insight into transmission dynamics and potential management and mitigation strategies."

[This is a valuable review of the ecology of CWD and the authors float the hypothesis that control might be achieved by burning deer grazing. The key paragraph in their review article reads (without references):

"Controlled burning of landscapes in North America helps to mitigate Ô¨Åre danger in drought-stricken areas, in some of which CWD is endemic. Burning of plants, feces, and topsoil in these areas may reduce the low-level prion infectivity present in these areas. While the burn temperature and duration are certainly much lower than those attained in the experiments for which Brown et al. reported residual prion infectivity, naturally CWD contaminated areas certainly contain many orders of magnitude less prion infectivity than prion-infected SRM [specified risk material]. Prescribed burning may sufficiently lower prion titers on landscapes to at least impede the indirect transmission of CWD. Combined with directed hunter harvests, systematic culling, and targeted implementation of CWD vaccines, we may be able to stem the slow but steady spread of CWD across the landscape."

Taking a flame thrower to an obviously contaminated site may well do some good but to a suspected meadow or normal deer habitat raises significant questions. I wish them luck. - Mod.MHJ
