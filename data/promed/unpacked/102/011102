Q fever restrictions in the Netherlands lifted
----------------------------------------------
The Dutch Agriculture Ministry has lifted restrictions on breeding
and transporting milk goats and milk sheep, which had been in force
since the outbreak of Q fever earlier this year [2010].

The disease is spread by bacteria that use pregnant goats and sheep
as hosts; it affects humans and can be lethal for weakened patients.
Since Jan 2010, 420 people have been infected with Q fever, and 5
people who were already suffering from other afflictions died.

The lifting of restrictions enables goat farmers to repopulate their
stables. In an attempt to minimise the spread of Q fever, 89 goat and
sheep farms were cleared of all livestock. This has led to a shortage
of some 35 000 goats, according to farmers' umbrella organisation
LTO. Many farmers have been financially crippled by the loss of
income, and LTO warns that many of them may not be able to restart
their businesses.

[The 91st farm to be found Q-fever infected in the Netherlands is a
dairy goat farm in Oirschot, North Brabant, about 12 km (7.5 miles)
north-west of Eindhoven (map at
<http://healthmap.org/r/01Ju>). Infection, detected by the PCR
testing of milk, has occurred in spite of vaccination, which had been
duly and timely carried on. Vaccination does not rule out infection
altogether, but is expected to significantly reduce bacteria
proliferation and spread by infected animals, and will prevent abortions.

The case was announced by the Ministry of Agriculture on 13 Jul 2010.
The vaccinated flock will not be culled nor will a breeding ban
implemented. To be on the safe side, prescribed biosecurity measures
have been applied.

The new infected location has been added to the Dutch Q-fever map,
available at
<http://www.vwa.nl/onderwerpen/dierziekten/dossier/q-koorts/kaart-met-overzicht-van-besmette-bedrijven>
(go to 'Kaart overzicht').

According to the data of the public health authorities, out of the
420 human Q-fever cases notified during 2010, 310 patients have
undergone their infection during 2010. It is known that 95 patients
got infected during 2009, 6 earlier, while the infection year of the
remaining 9 patients is still to be determined. - Mod.AS]
