An investigation has been launched into an outbreak of salmonellosis possibly linked to laverbread seaweed. Public Health Wales said there are 12 cases involving adults in the Swansea, Neath Port Talbot and Carmarthenshire areas, of which 10 ate laverbread in the days before they fell ill. A total of 3 people have needed hospital treatment but all have been discharged.

*****Anyone who bought laverbread on Tuesday [25 Mar 2014] or earlier that may have come from Penclawdd is asked to throw it away.

"Given that we cannot rule out laverbread at present, it is very important that... anyone with this product at home does not eat it," said Dr Jorg Hoffmann, Public Health Wales.

Local firm Penclawdd Shellfish Processing Ltd has withdrawn sales of its laverbread as a precaution. Product sampling carried out so far has not proved a firm link between the products and the outbreak and investigations are ongoing.

The product is available at a number of high street retailers and Penclawdd is the only supplier of laverbread to Tesco. Dr Jorg Hoffmann, consultant in communicable disease control for Public Health Wales, said: "We know that the majority of cases have eaten laverbread produced by Penclawdd. The company has cooperated fully with our investigations and has chosen to voluntarily withdraw the product from sale as a precaution.

"Laverbread is generally a safe product to eat, and it remains unclear whether it is indeed the source of this outbreak. However, given that we cannot rule out laverbread at present, it is very important that, to avoid the risk of illness, anyone with this product at home does not eat it."

Laverbread is the boiled and minced laver seaweed, often fried with bacon and cockles as a traditional Welsh breakfast dish. The seaweed is eaten worldwide, especially in Asia, and is often used in Japanese sushi dishes.

[Laver is a fine seaweed collected for consumption along the Welsh coastline. Laverbread is a Celtic delicacy which is produced from laver (very similar to the seaweed which is used by the Japanese -- nori). Welsh laverbread or "bara lawr" has nothing to do with bread and is rather like a puree that is most commonly enjoyed with shellfish or on hot buttered toast.

Since the seaweed is boiled during the preparation, if the laverbread is at fault, contamination occurred after the boiling. - Mod.LL
