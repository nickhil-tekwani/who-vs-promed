One person dies of tuberculosis every minute in India. The problem is equally severe in Chandigarh and adjoining areas, where the prevalence of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is as high as 9 percent, according to research conducted by the doctors of PGIMER [Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, a medical and research institution located in Chandigarh, India].

The study was conducted by Dr Sunil Sethi, Department of Medical Microbiology, and Dr Dheeraj Gupta, Department of Pulmonary Medicine, to access the prevalence of MDR-TB. Sputum and blood specimens were obtained from 2100 patients suspected of pulmonary tuberculosis.

It was found that the prevalence of MDR-TB was very high in newly diagnosed cases, that is, 9 percent, as compared to WHO reported figures, which are 3-5 percent. However, in previously treated patients, the prevalence was even higher, that is 27 percent, as these patients stop taking drugs in between [during a course of treatment] and bacteria become resistant to available drugs.

Overall, MDR-TB was observed in 17 percent of cases, and of all TB patients, 20 percent were found to be HIV positive.

Dr Sunil Sethi said, "MDR-TB is a serious threat to the national TB control programmes, and the situation worsens due to the HIV pandemic in the country. About 80 percent of HIV positive people develop TB, which is infectious and spreads from person to person."

He added: "If a person is diagnosed with MDR-TB, he/she has to be treated with 10 drugs per day for at least 2 years, and the chances of a cure are less, and the cost of medicine is one lakh [a lakh is a unit in the South Asian numbering system equal to 100 000, so INR 100 000 or USD 1825.00]. Tuberculosis, which was curable earlier, will soon become untreatable. MDR-TB continues to increase, and proper interventions are not taken."

It is very important not to stop the treatment in between, and patients can get free treatments at DOTS [directly observed treatment, short-course] centres located in different parts of the country.

The main reason for the increase in numbers of MDR-TB cases is that it is very difficult to diagnose, as all laboratories in India do not have culture facilities, and in those that do have them, it takes 3-4 months to diagnose it.

[The news report above says that 20 percent of all TB patients in Chandigarh, India were found to be HIV positive. For comparison, in the USA in 2011, among 8683 people with newly diagnosed TB who knew their HIV status, out of a total of 10 528 with newly diagnosed tuberculosis (TB), 6 percent were co-infected with HIV. Without treatment, TB and HIV infection increase the severity of each other. Worldwide, TB is a leading cause of death among people living with HIV. In the USA in 2006, although 12 percent of TB patients were co-infected with HIV, co-infection occurred in 32 percent of those who died during treatment for TB, and co-infection occurred in 51 percent of those who received a TB diagnosis postmortem (http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/factsheets/hivtb.htm).

The WHO (1,2) has reported that TB drug resistance data are available for 2/3rds of all countries in the world. The proportion of cases reported from 80 countries and 8 territories as showing resistance to at least the 2 most effective drugs used to treat TB, rifampin and isoniazid, (that is, that have MDR-TB) ranged from 0 to 28.9 percent in newly diagnosed TB (that is, primary drug resistance) and 0 to 65 percent in previously treated TB. High rates of drug resistance were reported in Belarus, Estonia, the Russian Federation, and Tajikistan.

However, national representative data are lacking in many large countries with high TB burdens, including India and several African countries. Routine drug susceptibility testing of all confirmed TB cases should be the goal, but there are very few laboratories to diagnose MDR-TB in developing countries, and only 34 countries and settings have a system in place to routinely test all patients with MDR-TB for 2nd-line anti-TB drug resistance. Lack of laboratory facilities capable of performing TB culture and drug-susceptibility testing prevents an effective response to early and appropriate case detection and treatment of MDR-TB. Conventional solid culture, which is currently the most common method used to detect drug resistance in developing countries, may take 2-3 months to produce results. During this time, patients may be inappropriately treated; drug resistant strains may continue to spread to close contacts, and amplification of drug resistance may occur. New molecular assays on DNA from _M. tuberculosis_ isolates or directly from smear-positive clinical specimens can dramatically speed the detection of members of the _M. tuberculosis_ complex while simultaneously identifying drug-resistant strains in less than one day.

WHO reported that national data are lacking on the frequency of MDR-TB among newly or previously treated patents and the frequency of XDR-TB among MDR-TB cases in many large countries, including India (figure 1, http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/90/2/11-092585.pdf). India and the Russian Federation -- the 2 large countries that, with China, contribute to more than 50 per cent of the estimated global burden of MDR-TB -- have only produced reliable sub-national level data to date. A survey in 2006 in the Indian state of Gujarat found that 3.2 per cent of 216 MDR isolates tested were XDR (table 2, http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/90/2/BLT-11-092585-table-T2.html).

The largest country that conducted a nationwide survey in the reporting period (2007-2010) was China, which conducted its 1st nationwide survey in 2007. The survey, which confirmed previously published estimates, based on extrapolation from sub-national level data, found 5.7 percent of new TB cases and 25.6 percent of previously treated cases have MDR-TB (1). The news report above says that 9 percent of newly diagnosed TB and 27 percent of previously treated cases have MDR-TB in Chandigarh, India. For comparison, the corresponding percentages for the USA are 1.1 and 4.4, respectively (1).
