[1] USA (Florida): portable morgues

Fourteen portable morgues are being sent to central Florida hospitals amid what one official called "unprecedented deaths" during the state's record COVID-19 crisis.

Each refrigerated morgue holds 12 bodies, Lynne Drawdy, executive director of the Central Florida Disaster Medial Coalition, who ordered the units, told the Orlando Sentinel.

"The number of deaths right now is unprecedented," Drawdy told the newspaper. "What we're hearing from the hospitals is that the death count right now is higher than it has ever been."

AdventHealth, which is getting 3 of the portable morgues, said in a statement to WESH Channel 2 that the system is also renting refrigerated units at 10 sites in Orange, Osceola, Polk, Seminole, and Volusia counties, noting that they are also being filled. The AdventHealth statement said bodies are backing up because funeral homes and crematoriums are also overwhelmed.

"COVID has never gone away," Kimberly Mitchell, owner of Mitchell's Funeral Home, told WMPG Channel 6 in Orlando. "The hospitals are starting to run out of room [with] refrigeration for people who have passed."

The Florida Department of Health reports 389 people have died from COVID-19 this past week, and 43 979 people have died from the virus in the state since the beginning of the pandemic.

Just over half of Florida residents -- 52% -- have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

"There is no question that the delta variant had changed everything," Raul Pino, health officer in Orange County, told the Sentinel. "But if we were at higher rates of vaccination, let's say 80 to 85% of our eligible population, the numbers would be smaller."

["As of Friday [27 Aug 2021], Florida was recording an average of 242 virus deaths a day, nearly as many as California and Texas combined, though a few states still had a higher per capita rate, according to public health data tracked by The New York Times.

"Florida's pandemic data, more scant since the state ended its declared COVID-19 state of emergency in June [2021], reveals only limited information about who is dying. Hospitals have said upward of 90% of their patients have been unvaccinated. Exactly why the state has been so hard hit remains an elusive question. Other states with comparable vaccine coverage have a small fraction of Florida's hospitalization rate.

"The best explanation of what has happened is that Florida's vaccination rates were good, but not good enough for its demographics. It has so many older people that even vaccinating a vast majority of them left more than 800 000 unprotected. Vaccination rates among younger people were uneven, so clusters of people remained at risk. Previous virus waves, which were milder than in some other states, conferred only some natural immunity.

"And Florida is Florida: People have enjoyed many months of barhopping, party-going and traveling, all activities conducive to swift virus spread."

"He [Governor Ron DeSantis] and other state officials have sought to steer away from measures that could curtail infections, banning strict mask mandates in public schools. The biggest school districts imposed them anyway, and on Friday [27 Aug 2021], a state judge ruled that Florida could not prevent those mandates, a decision the Department of Education plans to appeal."

[2] Israel
[A] Booster

The 3rd coronavirus vaccine shot is available for anyone who has been fully inoculated for at least 5 months, Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz said Sunday [29 Aug 2021]. Two million Israelis have received the booster shot.

Those who have received the booster, or have recently been vaccinated, will be exempt from isolation when they arrive from abroad, it was announced Sunday [29 Aug 2021] during a press conference with Health Ministry Director-General Nachman Ash, coronavirus commissioner Salman Zarka and Dr. Sharon Alroy-Preis, head of the ministry's Public Health Services.

"There is some improvement in morbidity, but it is too early to talk about the end of the 4th wave," Horowitz said at the press conference. "There is room for optimism, but we have no certainty that the slowdown will continue," he said, adding that in spite of the difficult situation, "in close cooperation with Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, we are maintaining a balanced and responsible approach. We value life above all, but do not forget that restrictions and closures have very severe consequences."

Starting on 1 Oct [2021], only those who have received the 2nd dose within the last 5 months, who have received a 3rd booster shot, who have recovered within the last 6 months, or who have recovered and received one shot will be eligible for the Green Pass, which grants access to several activities and venues, Zarka said.

"We are updating our definition of what it means to be vaccinated," he said.

According to the data collected by the ministry, those who have received a booster are 10 times more protected from infection and serious symptoms compared with those who have had 2 doses, Alroy-Preis said. Due to the new information, it was decided to update related policies, including travel restrictions.

Currently, all inbound travelers to Israel are required to quarantine for a minimum of 7 days, unless they come from a very limited group of countries.

Under the new rules, which are set to come into effect on Friday [3 Sep 2021], all those who are either vaccinated within the previous 5 months, or who were vaccinated earlier and received a booster, will be exempt from isolation if they return from all other countries, except those labeled as "red": Brazil, Bulgaria, Mexico, and Turkey.

"This is a very important message: We are not imposing restrictions for the sake of restrictions," Horowitz said. "The moment we see that the efficacy of vaccination is very high, we can loosen the requirement of isolation for those who come from abroad."

Over the past week, more than 100 000 shots were administered per day on weekdays, mostly boosters, but also 1st and 2nd doses.

So far, some 5.95 million Israelis have received at least one shot, and 5.46 million have received at least 2.

At last count, there were 726 coronavirus patients in serious condition on Sunday [29 Aug 2021], the most since March [2021]. Last week, the number of coronavirus patients in serious condition fluctuated between 680 and 700.

Although the number of tests administered on Saturday [28 Aug 2021] is lower than on weekdays, about 100 000 instead of 150 000, the rate of people with a positive result was over 7%, marking a 6-month record.

On Saturday [28 Aug 2021], 7071 people tested positive, and there are currently more than 80 000 active cases. During the peak of the 3rd wave, there were 88 000 active cases.

Just 3 days before schools are set to reopen, about 34 000 of the active cases are schoolchildren, and another 90 000 people are in isolation after being exposed to a verified patient.

At the same time, the reproduction rate, or R number, which measures how many people each virus carrier infects on average, has declined to as low as 1.11. An R of more than 1 indicates that the disease is spreading, but at a slower pace than in the past weeks.

Meanwhile, hundreds of healthcare workers gathered in front of the Health Ministry in Jerusalem on Sunday [29 Aug 2021] to protest against a lack of funding.

Seven public hospitals, including Jerusalem's Shaare Zedek Medical Center and Hadassah-University Medical Center, stopped receiving coronavirus patients last Monday [23 Aug 2021] and have been operating in emergency mode since Wednesday [25 Aug 2021], only admitting patients in need of life-saving treatment, because of a prolonged financial crisis.

So-called public hospitals are independent organizations that rely mostly on donations, as opposed to facilities directly owned and funded by the state or the health funds.

[B] Waning immunity
Date: Sun 29 Aug 2021

Citation: Goldberg Y, Mandel M, Bar-On YM et al. Waning immunity of the BNT162b2 vaccine: A nationwide study from Israel; 2021; https://www.gov.il/BlobFolder/reports/vaccine-efficacy-safety-follow-up-committee/he/files_publications_corona_immunity-waning-082021.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
---------
Background: Starting December 2020, Israel began a mass vaccination campaign against coronavirus disease, administering the Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine, which led to a sharp curtailing of the outbreak. After a period with almost no SARS-CoV-2 infections, a resurgent COVID-19 outbreak initiated mid-June 2021. Possible reasons for the breakthrough are reduced vaccine effectiveness against the delta variant, and waning immunity. The aim of this study is to quantify the extent of waning immunity as a function of the time since vaccination on a nationwide scale.

Methods: Data on all infections documented between 11-31 Jul 2021 of Israeli residents who became fully vaccinated before June 2021 were recorded together with the most severe disease status. Infection rates and severe COVID-19 cases among fully vaccinated individuals in different time periods were compared using a Poisson regression, stratifying by age group and adjusting for possible confounding factors.

Results: The rate of both documented SARS-CoV-2 infections and severe COVID-19 exhibits a clear increase as a function of time since vaccination. For example, people 60 years or older fully vaccinated in March 2021 were1.6 (CI: [1.3, 2]) times more protected against infection and were1.7 (CI: [1.0, 2.7]) times more protected against severe COVID-19 compared to those who fully vaccinated in January 2021. Similar results were obtained for the 16-39- and 40-59-year-old age groups.

Conclusions: The results suggest a strong effect of waning immunity. Quantifying the effect of waning immunity on vaccine effectiveness is critical for informing policy makers worldwide facing the decision of administering COVID-19 booster vaccinations.

Discussion: Understanding the extent of waning immunity is critical for policy making, especially in regard to vaccination strategies. The results presented in this paper were the basis of the decision by the Israeli Ministry of Health to give a 3rd dose of COVID-19 vaccine to people aged 60 or over who were vaccinated for at least 5 months starting 30 Jul 2021. It also suggests the need to closely follow the effects of waning immunity and inform policy makers facing the decision of administering booster vaccinations worldwide. The 3rd-dose campaign in Israel will be closely monitored in order to quantify the effectiveness of a booster dose in restoring protection that has waned over time.

[Another new Israeli preprint [see citation below] quantifies the extent to waning immunity, for both infections and severe illness, by age group. The bottom figure is for ages greater than 60, the earliest group to receive vaccination.

From @EricTopol, 29 Aug 2021: "Israeli data for 1 million people, age greater than 60, 4 million person-days with no booster vs 3.4 million person-days with booster: greater than 10-fold reduction of severe illness; approx. 11-fold reduction of infections. Preprint by @MiloLabWIS @IsraelMoH and colleagues just posted."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Discussion [excerpted]
----------------------
"This brings vaccine efficacy for booster-vaccinated individuals to approx. 95%, similar to the original 'fresh' vaccine efficacy reported against the alpha strain."

"For people with a more-than-12-days' lag between the booster vaxx and severe illness, we found that the booster dose decreases the relative risk of severe disease 15.5-fold (95% CI: 10.5, 22.8)."

From @EricTopol, 29 Aug 2021: "Israel's booster shot program opened to all age greater than or equal to age 12, 5 months out."
