[This gives backgound on a case contracted from a cat that was already
reported to WHO & posted on ProMED-mail - Mod.JW
The veterinarian didn't think much about it when the sweet, sick cat she
was treating for an infection bit her on the thumb. Four days later, a high
fever and intense pain in her arm sent her to the hospital. The diagnosis:
bubonic plague.
In the United States, 10 to 15 cases are reported in humans each year,
mostly in the West.
Plague is a bacterial disease of rodents that generally is transmitted
through flea bites. The culprits are most likely to be rock squirrels,
ground squirrels, prairie dogs or pack rats living roughly in the western
half of the United States. Most of the human cases occur in the Southwest
-- New Mexico accounts for more than half--and along the Sierra Nevada in
California. There have been human cases reported in at least 13 Western
states.
A roaming cat can bring plague to a suburban living room. Although flea
powder and other precautions can reduce the risk, and prompt treatment with
antibiotics can cure it, plague kills about 16% of its human victims,
according to the CDC.
There were 394 human plague cases in the nation from 1949 through 1997, 63
of them fatal. New Mexico logged 218 of those, including 30 fatalities,
said Paul Ettestad, public health veterinarian with the state Department of
Health. "It's a disease that can be fatal if not recognized and treated
early enough," Ettestad said.
Bubonic plague, which accounts for 80% of cases, is marked by swollen lymph
glands, called buboes. It's harder to diagnose septicemic plague, which
circulates in the bloodstream, and pneumonic plague, which infects the
lungs and is particularly dangerous because it can be transmitted through
coughing. Generally, those in contact with a pneumonic plague victim are
also treated with antibiotics.
"In the United States, we actually haven't had person-to-person
transmission since the 1920s--not that it couldn't occur," said the CDC's
Ken Gage.
Most people become sick two to seven days after infection. Other symptoms
are fever, chills, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
The incidence of plague appears to be cyclical, apparently linked to the
high-moisture, milder winters typical of El Nino years that cause rodents
to thrive, Ettestad said. This is a big year, with the rodent population in
New Mexico estimated at 10 to 20 times higher than last year -- when no one
in the state caught plague.
Believed to have evolved in central Asia, plague is new to the United
States. It arrived about 1900 in San Francisco aboard trading ships from
China and spread from urban rats into the wild rodent population of the
[American West. There were outbreaks in ports along the Gulf of Mexico,
but it never got established in the native rodents there, according to the
CDC.
Cats are more susceptible to plague than dogs, and get sicker.
Listlessness and not eating are clues that a cat is ill. "If you become
sick and there's a sick cat in the house, go see your doctor," [a
veterinarian advised.
Plague also can be contracted by handling infected animals. Hunters, for
example, are at risk if they don't wear gloves while skinning animals.
