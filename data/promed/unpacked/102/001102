Scientists identify new cholera-like strain
--------------------------
KOLKATA: A group of city-based scientists have recently helped the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) at Atlanta identify a rare strain
of cholera [cholera-like organism would be a better term -Mod.LL] which
wreaked havoc in coastal US and Japan early this year.
The new pathogen, transmitted through seafood, has become a major cause of
concern for scientists across the world. The reason behind its spread
through seafood was largely unknown and unexplained till the Indians made
the discovery.
"We received calls from the US asking us to help them identify what was
causing a new type of cholera and diarrhea in coastal areas of the country.
The germ was simultaneously active in coastal areas of Japan," said
director of National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED)
Sujit Kumar Bhattacharya.
Samples were flown in to Kolkata. "It was identified by our scientists as
_Vibrio parahaemolytica_ O3:K6 [ _V. parahaemolyticus_ ] an environmental
water borne pathogen," Bhattacharya said. "We also could link
this particular pathogen to an epidemic in 1998 in coastal Orissa," he
claimed, adding, "the pathogen generally attacks in the coastal region and
comes from the environment."
The pathogen is prominent in India, Bangladesh, Japan, Korea Thailand and
the US. "The disease spreads mainly through [uncooked or inadequately
cooked -Mod.LL] seafood. Maximum cases are reported from Japan where the
consumption of seafood is high. In the US, the disease was caused by
consumption of raw oysters," said NICED scientist T. Ramamurthy, who guided
the research.
"This is a new clone .[The characteristics that make this O3:K6 a different
clonal isolate than earlier ones is not stated. -Mod.LL] . Earlier, we were
not able to identify the strain but this time with newer techniques we were
successful," he said.
In India, prevalence of this type of _Vibrio_ infection is on the rise,
scientists claim. "There has not been a major outbreak since 1998 but we
see more and more cases in the coastal region. Moreover, with the food
habit changing drastically among people, it is also affecting non-coastal
areas," he said.
"We are preparing a literature on how to control the spread of the pathogen
and what kind of preventive measures can be taken," informed Bhattacharya,
adding, "we will forward the plan to all the international disease control
and research agencies."

[This organism is one of the "other pathogenic vibrios". A halophilic
(salt-requiring) organism, it has been recognized as the major cause of
acute diarrheal illness in Japan and has caused significant outbreaks of
food-borne disease along both the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast areas of
the US. It is also a very significant pathogen in other areas of Southeast
Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Unlike the organism causing classic
cholera that causes disease via an enterotoxin, _V. parahaemolyticus_
appears to be invasive as well as producing a toxin. The diarrheal illness
is preventable by adequately cooking the food vector (particularly shrimp
or crab) and keeping the food refrigerated and not rinsing the food with
contaminated seawater. It does not transmit well from person-to-person
probably related to a high inoculum required for infection.
Most cases of _V. parahaemolyticus_ do not require specific antimicrobial
therapy as they are self-limited. Other halophilic vibrios such as _V.
vulnificus_ and _V. alginolyticus_ are not generally associated with
diarrhea but instead cause soft tissue infection and/or bacteremia. -Mod.LL]
[The _V. parahaemolyticus O3:K6 strain has been the predominant pandemic
strain since 1996 when it was identified in several Asian outbreaks
(1,2,3,4). In 1998, it was identified as the strain responsible for an
outbreak in the USA associated with consumption of raw oysters and clams
harvested from Long Island Sound -- Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York
in the USA (5).
Chowdry et al (4) discusses the noted increase in _V. parahaemolyticus_
related outbreaks in recent years, and provides a discussion on 3 emerging
serotypes responsible for this increase of which the O3:K6 is the
predominant player. They conclude: "Until recently, V. parahaemolyticus
caused sporadic and localized diarrhea and--unlike _toxigenic V. cholerae_
O1 and O139--was never associated with a pandemic. However, with the advent
of the new O3:K6 strains in 1996, the epidemiology of this organism
abruptly changed. The dominant and continued occurrence of this serotype
was reported from eight countries. The extent and rapidity of spread of the
new O3:K6 strains signaled the beginning of the first pandemic of V.
parahaemolyticus. We have shown that the recent O3:K6 isolates from eight
countries were identical in the RFLP of the rRNA genes and showed similar
PFGE profiles. We have also shown that strains of two other serotypes,
O4:K68 and O1:KUT, isolated since 1995 possessed ribotype and PFGE patterns
similar to those of the new O3:K6 strains. Variations between the three
pandemic serotypes are minor when compared to the differences seen with the
nonpandemic strains. Hence, from the molecular analysis and chronology of
appearance of these strains, the O4:K68 and O1:KUT isolates appear to have
originated from the existing O3:K6 clone. The ribotype and PFGE patterns
displayed by the pandemic clone are unique. Therefore, a single clone may
be responsible for the emergence of pandemic serotypes that have different
somatic and capsular antigens. This study suggests that the
epidemiologically related strains may also be genetically related."
As indicated above, one wonders if the isolate this newswire is referring
to is genetically identical to the pandemic clone described above, or if
there has been a genetic alteration suggesting a new variant in circulation.
