Consumers "must be persuaded that vaccinated beef is safe"
----------------------------------------------------------
A campaign to promote the safety of meat and milk from animals vaccinated
against foot-and-mouth disease was recommended yesterday as a vital weapon
to combat any future outbreak. The country's leading scientific
establishment, the Royal Society, insists that consumers must be won over
if the Government is to adopt a vaccination strategy. As The Times revealed
last month, the scientific inquiry backs the use of "ring" vaccination as
"major tool of first resort" to prevent any future outbreak becoming an
epidemic.
Unlike the Dutch experience last year, when vaccinated animals were
subsequently slaughtered and banned from human consumption, the inquiry
team advocates "vaccinate to live" with animals going normally into the
food chain. It is demanding a change of rules throughout the European Union
by the end of next year.
Sir Brian Follett, chairman of the inquiry, said that the Food Standards
Agency had already advised that there were no risks to human health about
eating products from vaccinated animals. He added: "I don't know if society
can face the alternative." (He was clearly referring to the mass slaughter
last year of more than 10 million farm animals.) Ian McConnell, director of
research at the Department of Clinical Veterinary Medicine at Cambridge
University, said that we already consume products from animals vaccinated
against 33 other diseases.
Consumer resistance was one of the main reasons for the Government
rejecting a vaccination programme last year. Supermarkets were willing to
stock vaccinated food but feared labelled products could be left unsold.
Sir Brian said such a controversial debate should not take place at the
height of an epidemic. Contingency plans for a future outbreak of livestock
diseases should be debated in public and agreed by all interested groups
including consumers. An emergency drill should be rehearsed each year.
The inquiry also criticised the slaughter of animals within a mile of an
infected farm. This so-called "contiguous cull" was recommended by
scientists who had drawn up worst-case scenarios and forecasts for the
disease. David Black, a vet in private practice in Cumbria and a member of
the inquiry, said: "We still don't know how 80 percent of farms became
infected. The contiguous cull was an attempt to identify infected animals
but it was a blunt instrument."
The 400 000-pounds inquiry report concludes, however: "For the foreseeable
future there is no alternative, when an outbreak occurs, to the rapid
culling of diseased animals, and all those that are ... likely to have been
infected by them." Sir Brian explained that the inquiry had favoured
emergency vaccination because mass culling was ineffective. "Five times in
80 years we have not been able to contain this disease with these methods.
So we think, in most cases, we should use vaccination."
The inquiry also accepted that the United Kingdom should seek to remain
free of the disease without routine vaccination. Within 10 to 15 years,
however, a policy of routine vaccination may be possible. Diagnostic tests
will first have to be developed to distinguish whether an animal is
vaccinated or infected. Ben Gill, president of the National Farmers' Union,
supported emergency vaccination as an option. "The threat of importing
disease is increasing. It is vital that the resources needed to protect our
animal populations and native crops and plants keep pace with that."
A new early-warning system to alert the country to the potential threat of
new animal and human diseases is proposed by the Royal Society inquiry.
Bluetongue is a disease of sheep and goats, never yet found in Britain but
present in North America, China, Spain, France, Italy and the Balkans "and
so might move into Britain." It is fatal in 70 percent of cases. African
horse sickness can also affect dogs. Like bluetongue, this disease spreads
by midge bites. Avian influenza or fowl plague, always fatal to poultry,
was last seen in Britain 10 years ago. In 1997 a lethal strain was
transmitted directly from chickens to humans in Hong Kong. All chickens
there were slaughtered, a move the report describes as "drastic but wise."
Emergency vaccination is used to control an outbreak.

Foot and mouth computer data was inadequate
-------------------------------------------
Computer models used to formulate policy in last year's foot and mouth
epidemic relied on inadequate data, making the contiguous cull a "blunt
instrument", the official scientific inquiry into the crisis said yesterday.
The Royal Society's report into infectious diseases in livestock
commissioned by the Government criticised the reliance on live mathematical
modelling, until then unproven in animal epidemics. It also called for
emergency vaccination to be used instead of contiguous slaughter and said
it was now up to the Government to convince the public and supermarkets
that eating vaccinated meat was not a health risk.
Prof Sir Brian Follett, inquiry chairman, said Britain should be ready by
the end of 2003 to use vaccination as a "major tool of first resort"
provided the Government clarified some of the issues surrounding
vaccination. He called for research to be stepped up so that reliable
prophylactic vaccination could be developed with the aim of stamping out
foot and mouth worldwide forever.
Sir Brian also said there was "no sense" to the countryside closures last
year, estimated to have cost the rural economy between 5 billion and 20
billion pounds. The report recommended that future contingency plans should
be decided and debated by Parliament to prevent party political or other
interests interfering with the plan's execution during an outbreak.But for
many opponents of the contiguous cull, the report will be vindication that
the policy was based on false assumptions.
While there was "considerable benefit to be gained from understanding" how
epidemics spread using computer modelling, the report said "more work is
required to refine the existing models and to strengthen their capacity to
inform policy".
In March 2001, as the Government insisted it was not facing a crisis in the
run-up to the election, Prof David King, the Government chief scientist,
took over control of handling the outbreak.
He called in a team of epidemiologists from Imperial College, London, led
by Prof Roy Anderson. Their analysis confirmed that the epidemic was out of
control. Prof King's solution, supported by modelling of 2 other teams, was
the contiguous cull policy. But yesterday it was condemned by David Black,
a veterinary member of the inquiry committee, as a "blunt instrument.
"We still do not understand how 80 per cent of farms became infected in the
last outbreak. We need a lot more work to understand how disease spreads."
The report called for a central database to be set up on farms, location of
animals, animal movements and the characteristics of diseases.
Prof Anderson conceded that the contiguous cull policy adopted as a result
of his team's work was crude. "It was a blunt tool but, in the crisis and
given the degree to which the disease was spreading, it was unfortunately
the only tool available," he said.
Lord Moran, who 4 months ago pressed a crucial vote that defeated the
animal health Bill, said the report would force the Government to
re-examine its Bill. "Part One of the Bill was based entirely on the
legitimising and carrying out of mass slaughter," he said. "A re-think is
clearly necessary."

[The specific comment of the Inquiry on routine vaccination of List A
diseases (which include FMD) as appearing in its summary, says:
"Routine vaccination against some of the OIE List A diseases is possible.
While there are no overwhelming scientific or economic reasons against this
approach being adopted we believe that, at present, the considerable
technical problems and the trade implications argue against changing
current arrangements.
Nevertheless it is clear that the long-term solution is to develop a
vaccine against FMD (and other diseases such as classical swine fever) that
confers lifelong sterile immunity against all strains of the virus. An
international research effort is required to develop such a vaccine".
This new approach towards vaccination is far-reaching and in conflict with
the traditional UK policy, devoutly followed since the adoption of the
recommendations in the Northumberland Report. The said "Report of the
Committee of Inquiry on Foot-and-Mouth Disease", Parts 1 and 2, published 7
Mar 1969 and 3 Nov 1969, investigated the 1967-8 epidemic and recommended
continuation of the non-vaccination, stamping-out policy. More than 2
decades later, in 1991, the same policy was adopted by the EU:
discontinuing the annual, preventive vaccination policy performed by most
central and southern European countries for decades, generally with very
good results (when meticulously performed). This policy change was
reflected in the International Animal-Health Code of the OIE. The changed
policy had distinct trade impact, excluding countries that decided to
continue vaccinations from exporting live ruminants and their unprocessed
products to the EU. This led some of them, such as beef-producing countries
in South America, to try and adopt also a non-vaccination policy. It will
be interesting now to follow possible changes in the EU legislation and the
OIE Code. - Mod.AS].
