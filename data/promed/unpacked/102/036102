In Moxuma, municipality of Soracachi [Oruro department], a new case of rabies in a South American camelid (SAC) was confirmed after samples were sent to National Institute of Health Laboratories (INLASA). A dog, presumably with rabies, had attacked the animal approximately 2 months ago. Ernesto Vásquez, in charge of the regional Zoonosis services in Oruro, confirmed the new case. The National Service for Animal and Plant Health and Inoquity (SENASAG) set out an investigation to verify the existence of further cases in Soracachi, Moxuma and Paria.

The camelid was bitten 2 months previously by a stray dog, which sparked decisions related to camelid vaccination and search for suspicious cases in dogs. "If rabies was transmitted by a dog, then most likely more animals were infected, for which an extensive search is being conducted in Soracachi, Moxuma and Paria ", said Vásquez.

According to a preliminary report, the dog that bit the camelid was not identified and it has no known owner. The week before, 10 samples were sent to INLASA, 9 dog samples were negative and the camelid sample was positive. The typification test shows the rabies virus involved is the one transmitted by dogs.

So far in 2016, there have been in Oruro 13 cases of dog rabies, and this one in camelid, makes the number 4 in this species.

[It is unclear whether the SAC involved is a lama or an alpaca. Both are common hoofstock in Bolivia. Bolivia is amongst the countries with the highest incidence of human rabies transmitted by dogs in the Western hemisphere. Canine rabies control activities require urgent action, but this has been challenging in Bolivia due to social, cultural, and economic factors.
