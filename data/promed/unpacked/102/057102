People vaccinated before late February [2021] are twice as likely to catch the coronavirus than other inoculated Israelis, according to new research.

"We looked at tens of thousands of people tested in the month of June [2021], alongside data on how long had passed since their 2nd shot, and found that those vaccinated early were more likely to test positive," Dr. Yotam Shenhar, who headed the research, told The Times of Israel. "This definitely reinforces the argument for giving a 3rd vaccine dose to the elderly."

The report, published by the healthcare provider Leumit, comes on the heels of other Israeli studies that suggest a decreasing vaccine effectiveness, partly as a result of the delta variant and partly because of the passage of time. However, British data indicates the Israeli studies may be overstating the case.

Data released by the Health Ministry on Thursday [22 Jul 2021] suggested that people vaccinated in January [2021] were said to have just 16% protection against infection now, while in those vaccinated in April [2021], the effectiveness was at 75%.

The Leumit study looked only at the apparent waning of protection over time and divided the vaccinated population into 2 based on inoculation dates, comparing early vaccinators to late vaccinators.

Shenhar, head of Leumit's labs, acknowledged that the early vaccinators group includes many people who raced to get shots because they have underlying illnesses, which may make them more vulnerable to infection. But he said that could not fully account for the stark effect seen in the data.

Shenhar said the data should prompt the government to seriously consider booster shots for over-70s.

"Now we see vaccination effectiveness drops, so it seems we definitely need to think about a 3rd vaccine," he said. "We have started already by giving the immunocompromised, but in my assessment, we need to consider giving 3rd shots to everyone over 70 or 80. We shouldn't wait long; we need to make a decision fast."

If he were formulating policy, Shenhar said, he would "definitely" start giving boosters to elderly Israelis.

In his study, the apparent waning effect in immunity was felt across all ages. For all age groups, early vaccinators were 1.95 times more likely to be confirmed coronavirus positive. Among those aged 60-plus, early vaccinators are twice as likely to get infected. For those aged 40-59, early vaccinators are 2.1 times more vulnerable, and among under 39s, they are 1.6 more likely to catch the coronavirus.

"In a previous analysis, we showed that as time passes since the vaccine, the level of antibodies drops at a rate of about 40% per month. This new study builds a clearer picture of the effect seen in the months after vaccination," said Shenhar.

Israel has seen a dramatic rise in recent COVID-19 infections, with the daily caseload rising from several dozen to over 1400 in recent days.

[From Eran Segal, @segal_eran
"As expected, "rate" of growth of critically ill is exponential (straight line in log-scale) and similar between vaxed and unvaxed 60+ y/o. Height difference of [about] 4-fold is likely vaccine effect. Expected to grow with 3rd dose effect. Data courtesy @LittleMoiz @Aargoetti."

It seems like a 3rd dose is in order. Along that same line,

"Fauci Says US Can Move Quickly to Offer 3rd Vaccine Shots

"Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser, said the US will be 'absolutely prepared' to distribute a 3rd shot of the coronavirus vaccine quickly to a wider population if needed.

He gave no timeline but said health officials are evaluating various groups 'on a daily and weekly basis.'

'So if it turns out, as the data come in, we see we do need to give an additional dose to people in nursing homes, actually, or people who are elderly, we will be absolutely prepared to do that very quickly,' he said on CBS's Face the Nation."

[2] Antibody kinetics
Date: Fri 13 Aug 2021
Source: Medical News Today [abridged, edited]
https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-long-do-sars-cov-2-antibodies-persist-after-infection


In a new study, which appears in the journal Nature Communications [see citation below], researchers report that SARS-CoV-2 antibodies remain stable for at least 7 months following infection. There were also signs that levels of some neutralizing antibodies increased during this time.

Furthermore, the researchers found evidence that a past infection with one of 4 human coronaviruses that cause the common cold may provide some protection against infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.

Prof. Alessandro Sette from the Center for Infectious Disease and Vaccine Research at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, in California, said that the findings in the paper corroborate other research into the immune response to a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

"That is consistent with several other studies that show antibody response as being durable over time following natural infection," he noted. "Our paper in Science showed a durable response of up to 8 months, not only for antibodies, but also for T cells."

"Antibodies are the main mechanism by which you can prevent infection," he explained. "However, once the virus is inside the cells, it is not accessible to antibodies, and that is where T cells play an important role, because T cells can recognize and kill infected cells. While antibodies are key for preventing infection, the T cells are key for terminating and controlling an infection.

"In that light," he added, "it has been shown that people who have early and strong T cell responses are associated with a less severe disease outbreak. You can't exactly predict T cell responses on the basis of antibody responses, or antibody responses on the basis of T cell responses. That's why it's important to measure all of them. That doesn't detract from the interest and the validity of the paper in Nature Communications."

Prof. Sette also said that the apparent protection offered by previous infection of common cold coronaviruses is supported in earlier research looking at T cells: "Early on [in the pandemic] we and several other groups reported that some people have preexisting T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2. This is at least in part because some people are infected with the common cold coronaviruses. Some people have a degree of preexisting immunity that cross-reacts with SARS-CoV-2.

"What has been less clear is whether that matters. So if someone has a preexisting immunity due to exposure to the common cold that cross-reacts with SARS-CoV-2, is that good? Is that bad? Or is it indifferent?

"We and others pointed out that it's possible to hypothesize that people that have this preexisting cross-reactive immunity may do better because, essentially, you get a head start in your response against the virus. You already have some degree of immunity, so your response against the virus may be stronger, may be faster, and so forth," said Prof. Sette.

In a new preprint study that has yet to go through the peer review process [see medRxiv citation below], Prof. Sette and his co-authors found that antibody responses to the Moderna vaccine were also well maintained months after vaccination. Further, they found evidence that people with good T cell activity prior to vaccination developed a faster and better immune response to the vaccines.

"Seven months after a vaccination with a quarter dose of the Moderna vaccine, antibodies are still very durable, similar or better to what you get in natural infection. The T cell responses are also durable and comparable," Prof. Sette explained.

"It makes sense if you have preexisting immunity that you may be able to mount a faster and better immune response. In the case of natural infection, if you have this preexisting T cell or antibody activity that may give you some advantage."

Prof. Sette provided an analogy: "Maybe you have some bad guys that are robbing a bank. A few hours after, you will have a SWAT team, but maybe at the start, all you had was 2 security guards. But they can do something! They can call back up, they can organize, and it's better than not having anything at all."

For Prof. Sette, the study in Nature Communications supports research looking at the possibility that vaccines could be developed that are effective against all types of coronavirus.

"This type of data brings to the forefront the fact that you might have a benefit from having immune activity that is cross-reactive among different coronaviruses," he told us.

"That could be very relevant in terms of preventing, God forbid, the next pandemic. Because, rightly so, people are concerned about other coronaviruses that may be now in bats or in other animal species that could spill over, or concerned about the next variants of SARS-CoV-2.

"So if you have different coronaviruses of concern, [these] data [suggest that] there may be some parts of coronaviruses that are relatively invariant, as far as the immune system is concerned. People are exploring the concept of focusing the immune response towards those parts, which could provide a pan-corona vaccine concept," he went on to note.

"Again, this may not fully prevent infection, but if that vaccine would be able to prevent severe disease and hospitalization from any different coronavirus of human concern, that is certainly worth exploring."

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
---------
"Unraveling the long-term kinetics of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and the individual characteristics influencing it, including the impact of pre-existing antibodies to human coronaviruses causing common cold (HCoVs), is essential to understand protective immunity to COVID-19 and devise effective surveillance strategies. IgM, IgA, and IgG levels against 6 SARS-CoV-2 antigens and the nucleocapsid antigen of the 4 HCoV (229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1) were quantified by Luminex, and antibody neutralization capacity was assessed by flow cytometry, in a cohort of health-care workers followed up to 7 months (N = 578). Seroprevalence increases over time from 13.5% (month 0) and 15.6% (month 1) to 16.4% (month 6). Levels of antibodies, including those with neutralizing capacity, are stable over time, except IgG to nucleocapsid antigen and IgM levels that wane. After the peak response, anti-spike antibody levels increase from approximately 150 days post-symptom onset in all individuals (73% for IgG), in the absence of any evidence of re-exposure. IgG and IgA to HCoV are significantly higher in asymptomatic than symptomatic seropositive individuals. Thus, pre-existing cross-reactive HCoVs antibodies could have a protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease."

Discussion
----------
"In conclusion, antibody levels and neutralizing capacity are generally maintained up to 7.7 months, and in a substantial number of individuals, antibody levels increase after some months PSO [post symptom onset]. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms and nature of these increases and their implications for virus shedding and disease progression. Importantly, previous exposure to HCoVs could have a protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptoms development, and may explain in part the differential susceptibility to disease in the population. Additional work focusing on prospective cohorts would allow the assessment of mechanisms and confirm causality in anti-HCoV antibodies on SARS-CoV-2 acquisition, disease progression, immune response maintenance, and correlates of protection."

[In the past 24 hours, 14 countries including Iran (36 736), India (33 221), USA (30 883), UK (26 426), Russia (21 624), France (21 172), Thailand (21 157), Indonesia (20 813), Malaysia (20 546), Japan (20 113), Turkey (18 847), Philippines (14 295), Brazil (13 957), and South Africa (10 139) have reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 7623 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 13 Aug 2021 to late 14 Aug 2021). A total of 45 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 20 of the 45 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 5 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 2.5%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 0.42%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 19.1% increase in daily reported cases and 18.9% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 450 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 207.98 million cumulative reported cases and over 4.37 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
