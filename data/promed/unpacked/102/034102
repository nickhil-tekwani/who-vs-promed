Viet Nam: seroprevalence study planned on basis of preliminary western blot
analysis
--------------------------------------------------
A nagging question about avian (H5N1) influenza virus infection of humans
in Viet Nam is whether there is considerably more mild, clinically
undetected or inapparent infection than accounted for by only considering
the most seriously ill cases admitted to hospital. Since the most seriously
ill are the tip of the iceberg in most human viral diseases, this is a
plausible concern. Its significance would be that there is more
transmission of the virus -- either from poultry to humans or from human to
human -- than has been conceded at present. Equivocal evidence to suggest
this has apparently been obtained by a joint Vietnamese-Canadian research
team working in Hanoi.

Using a method called western blotting, the researchers tested hundreds of
stored blood samples to see if these showed evidence of antibodies to H5N1
virus. Rumors are that: "scores of samples came back positive." As a
consequence the Vietnamese authorities have asked for international assistance.

A team of international influenza experts is in Hanoi, at the invitation of
the Vietnamese government, to investigate worrisome signs that avian H5N1
influenza virus may be adapting in ways that may make it more likely to
spark an influenza pandemic, the World Health Organization has confirmed.
The group of about a half-dozen virologists and epidemiologists from the
United States, Britain, Japan and Hong Kong will be following up concerns
raised at a special WHO avian influenza summit held last month in Manila,
spokespersons for the organization said on Thu 23 Jun 2005. The team will
also be analysing some potentially disturbing but hard-to-assess test
results that could suggest a significant number of additional human
infections have occurred but went undetected.

That's what we know at this point..... but Dick Thompson, director of
communications for the WHO's communicable diseases branch in Geneva, stated
that: "These are highly questionable results, difficult to evaluate at the
moment".

The official explanation for this diffidence is the possibility the western
blotting is not sufficiently specific to rule out [the possibility that] it
is detecting antibodies to other influenza strains [serotypes] than H5N1,
although for other viruses "westerns" are used as confirmatory tests
because they are more specific than the conventional ELISA tests.

Westerns are "antibodies against antibody" tests and are not especially
easy to do, but are easier and less hazardous than the current gold
standard, the neutralization test. Neutralization tests use live H5N1 virus
and tissue culture cells. If the subject's serum contains antibodies to
H5N1 it will block its infectivity. This is not only a technically
demanding test but requires adequate biosafety facilities, not available in
Vietnamese laboratories. The Canadian team was trying to see if westerns
could substitute for neutralization tests, so this effort could properly be
considered a research study.

However that doesn't mean it is of no significance. There is good reason to
believe westerns are both sensitive and specific and would make a good
substitute for neutralization assays. The next step is to verify [compare]
the westerns with neutralization tests, which will necessitate sending the
blood sera outside of Viet Nam to a WHO reference laboratory.

[A systematic seroprevalence survey in Viet Nam and elsewhere in East Asia
is a welcome development and long overdue, either employing western
blotting -- if this proves reliable and accurate -- or penetrably using
neutralization tests. - Mod.CP]
