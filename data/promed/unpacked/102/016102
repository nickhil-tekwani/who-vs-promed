[1] Cases in various countries
Asia

Pakistan
- Sindh (Karachi). 7 Feb 2018. At least 19 more cases of dengue fever were reported in Karachi in a week, taking the toll of reported cases in 2018 to 107. According to the weekly report issued by Prevention and Control Program for Dengue in Sindh, a total of 110 cases have been reported throughout Sindh so far out of which 107 were in Karachi and the other 3 in the rest of the province. No death has been reported due to dengue fever this month [February 2018] so far. In 2017, a total of 2927 cases of dengue fever were reported across Sindh out of which 12 lost their lives to the disease.

Saudi Arabia
- Jeddah. 28 Jan 2018. Dengue fever cases in Jeddah dropped by 38 percent in 2017.The awareness campaign helped bring down the number of dengue cases in the city by 50.7 percent compared to the same period in the previous year [2017]. The health affairs directorate announced last March [2017] when it launched the awareness campaign that it had registered 500 cases during the previous 10 weeks.

Cambodia.
- National. 5 Feb 2018. A report from the ministry said that in the 1st 3 weeks of 2018, there was a 130 percent spike in cases when compared to the 1st 3 weeks of 2017. The report added that dengue fever outbreaks usually occur every 5 to 6 years.

The ministry said that in the 1st 3 weeks of 2018, there were 316 cases of dengue fever and one death, an increase of 130 percent when compared to the 138 cases and zero deaths for the same time period in 2017.

The warning that a spike could be coming in 2018 follows news that cases were cut in half in 2017 when compared to 2016. The number of dengue fever cases dropped by more than half in 2017, with only 3 deaths.

Huy Rekol, director of the National Centre for Parasitology, Entomology and Malaria Control, said there were 6372 cases of dengue fever in the country in 2017. In 2016, there were 12 843 cases, with 18 deaths.

Pacific
---
- Tonga. 30 Jan 2018. Tonga has declared a dengue outbreak following the death of a New Zealand girl in the country last week. The 12-year-old had been visiting family in Tonga over the Christmas holidays. The chief executive of Tonga's Ministry of Health said there were 19 confirmed cases of dengue in the country, all on the main island Tonga'tapu.

- Tonga. 1 Feb 2018. A national campaign to control the spread of dengue started today as the number of people who have caught the disease climbed to 33 as of this afternoon, 1 February. Schools are waiting for funding to start spraying.

- Tonga. 5 Feb 2018. As dengue cases increase to 52 on Tongatapu as of this afternoon, 5 February, a medical officer from the Ministry of Health admitted they lack the ability to treat hemorrhagic dengue because they are waiting to replace a broken centrifuge.

[2] Vaccination

On [Fri 2 Feb 2018], Filipino authorities tied at least 3 deaths to the 2016
deployment of Dengvaxia, the world's 1st dengue fever vaccine, Reuters
reported.

Vaccine manufacturer Sanofi Pasteur admitted in November [2017] that the vaccine, Dengvaxia, might increase the odds of severe illness in inoculated children who had not previously been infected with the dengue virus. Over 800 000 children were injected with the vaccine, and a panel of experts formed to investigate 14 deaths concluded that at least 3 had "causal
association," per Reuters:

"Up to 3 cases were found to have causal association. They died of dengue even (though) they were given Dengvaxia. Two of them may have died because of vaccine failure," Health Undersecretary Enrique Domingo told a news conference.

"These findings strengthen the decision of the Department of Health to stop
the vaccine. It has failed in some children. Dengvaxia is not ready for mass
vaccinations and we would need 3 to 5 more years to watch and monitor
if there would be other adverse reactions from the vaccine."

[3] Research: Bacteria Block Transmission of Zika and Dengue Viruses

Scientists at the University of Glasgow have found a bacterial strain which blocks dengue and Zika virus transmission from mosquitoes. In the new study, published today [Mon 29 Jan 2018] in PLOS Pathogens, scientists show that a novel strain of the inherited bacteria Wolbachia strongly blocks transmission of dengue and Zika virus among infected mosquitoes, offering a potential alternative to strains already being tested as virus control tools.

Scientists from the University of Glasgow's MRC Centre for Virus Research (CVR) have carried out the research in the mosquito species Aedes aegypti, which spreads a number of dangerous human viruses, including dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya.

Previous research has shown that transmission of these viruses among mosquitoes is inhibited if the flies are deliberately infected with one strain of Wolbachia bacteria, and several countries are testing whether infecting local mosquito populations with Wolbachia could lower rates of viral disease in humans.

Now University of Glasgow CVR scientists have shown that a novel strain 'wAu' is even more effective for virus transmission blocking than strains currently being used, particularly in hot, tropical climates where there is high prevalence of these diseases.

Several Wolbachia strains have already been tested in the field, but there is evidence to suggest that some strains may not block transmission very effectively or may not be inherited efficiently at high ambient temperatures. In the new study, the research team performed laboratory experiments to test the potential promise of alternative Wolbachia strains. The researchers introduced 4 Wolbachia strains into Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which do not naturally carry these arthropod-infecting bacteria. Two of the strains, wMel and wAlbB had already been evaluated in prior studies, and the scientists wanted to compare their effects with those of 2 novel strains, wAu and wAlbA.

The analysis revealed particularly promising results for strain wAu. After feeding on blood infected with dengue or Zika virus, mosquitoes infected with wAu had lower levels of viral RNA in their body tissue than did mosquitoes infected with the other strains. wAu also showed very high rates of inheritance, including under high-temperature conditions.

Quote from Professor Steven Sinkins: "The Wolbachia transmission blocking strategy shows great promise for the control of mosquito-borne viruses, and is now starting to be deployed on a large scale in a number of tropical countries. Our results with the wAu strain showed by far the effective transmission blocking for all the viruses we tested, and it provides an exciting new option to explore for disease control programmes".

Future research could explore strategies to maximize the effectiveness of wAu in the field, such as combining it with a 2nd strain to help it spread throughout local mosquito populations.

Prof Sinkins holds a Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) grant, which is jointly awarded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences - and Medical Research Councils (BBSRC and MRC). With the funding, he will lead a global network studying vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, dengue and zika.
The goal is to reduce and block the transmission of pathogens by releasing specific insect disease vectors. Wolbachia, for example, is already starting to be deployed in several countries.

Dr Jonathan Pearce, Head of Infections and Immunity at the MRC, said: "This is incredibly relevant research with implications that can be applied to pressing issues on the ground in many parts of the world. These findings may be key to uncovering a new tool in the fight against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases.

"Meanwhile, the international network is pulling together experts from a wide range of scientific disciplines to exchange knowledge and brainstorm promising new ways to target vector-borne diseases."

The study, 'The Wolbachia strain wAu provides highly efficient virus transmission blocking in Aedes aegypti' is published today [Mon 29 Jan 2018] in PLOS Pathogens. The work was funded by the Wellcome Trust and the Medical Research Council. This article has been republished from materials provided by the University of Glasgow.
