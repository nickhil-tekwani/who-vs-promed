Consumers who have purchased products from an Onaway food producer are being advised to throw the items away due to concerns of botulism. The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development on Friday, 11 Dec 2015, issued a warning stating Lock Stock and Barrel Ranch products were manufactured without the required controls for the safe production of processed foods. Lock Stock and Barrel Ranch makes jams, salsa, pickled products, soup mixes and other items.

No illnesses have been identified at this time. The potential problem was discovered during a routine food safety inspection.

The products under recall were sold in glass jars ranging from 8 ounces to 32 ounces at Lock Stock and Barrel Ranch's general store, 20420 State St., in Onaway. The items were also sold at farm markets in Rogers City, Posen, Indian River and Gaylord.

The following products are under recall:

- Beef Vegetable Soup
- Tomato Basil Soup
- Bacon Cauliflower Soup
- Mama Splans Medium Salsa
- Mama Splans Hot Salsa
- Sweet Salsa
- Tomatillo Salsa
- Mango Salsa
- Peach Salsa
- Dilly Beans
- Pickled Beets
- Pickled Carrots
- Pickled Mushrooms
- Pickled Asparagus
- Pickled Cauliflower
- Pickled Garlic
- Bread & Butter Pickles
- Sweet & Hot Pickles
- Dill Pickles
- Dill Relish
- Bloody Mary Mix
- Spaghetti Sauce

Consumers who have any of the listed products or foods made with those products should throw them away. State officials suggest double-bagging the items in plastic bags that are tightly closed and placing them in a trashcan outside the home.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures that could, but do not necessarily, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
