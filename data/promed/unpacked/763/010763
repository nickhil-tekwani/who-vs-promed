Bird flu control efforts under scrutiny
---------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) has urged Viet Nam to intensify control
of transport and trading of poultry during the upcoming traditional lunar
New Year festival (Tet) to stop the spread of bird flu. The WHO has
announced that it will help Viet Nam identify the H5N1 virus, after the
country confirmed 2 deaths this week [1st week of January 2005].
According to WHO officials, the chilly winter weather and Tet preparations
could increase the risk of virus infections from poultry to humans.
In Ho Chi Minh City, more than 1000 ducks in Thanh My ward, district Number
2, tested positive for H5N1. The municipal veterinary agency has
disinfected the affected farms and quarantined the ducks for culling.
In district 10, 3 pets [which species? - Mod.AS] were reportedly dead due
to H5N1. The district veterinary service has captured 200 pets to take
samples for tests. [This piece of information might be of epidemiological
significance; official, 1st-hand confirmation is required. Sporadic AI
cases in felines had been recorded in Thailand and Cambodia during 2004.
Chinese investigators reported about the recording of AI in a tiger in
2002; there was one anecdotal report from Thailand on AI in a dog. See
references. - Mod.AS].
At an urgent meeting on Thursday [6 Jan 2005], the municipal veterinary
agency reported that the city has nearly 796 000 poultry, excluding 30 000
poultry and 600 000 eggs transported from other locations to the city each
day. The city has 50 poultry slaughter houses, 7 of them located in the
market places.
The agency suggested that the city immediately close illegal abattoirs and
intensify supervision of poultry processing and trading units, all of which
are obliged to ensure hygiene and safety in food sources.
Vice mayor Nguyen Thanh Tai said that it is a must to act drastically to
prevent human and material losses.
In Long An province, about 2000 ducks in Duc Hue district and 3000 quails
in Tan Thanh district have been culled due to H5N1 infections. The province
has asked the veterinary and health care sectors to take samples for tests
in all communes and wards in the province and to cull poultry flocks if
they show symptoms of viral infection.
Long An has 3 million poultry, and Ho Chi Minh City is its largest poultry
consumer. The provincial veterinary agency said the most important thing
now is to keep its poultry stocks free from viral infection to ensure
enough supplies to Ho Chi Minh City.
The head of the agency, Nguyen Duy Long, said the province has established
3 mobile quarantine stations on major roads leading to the province to
control the situation. To ensure communal health, special vehicles will be
used to transport healthy poultry to Ho Chi Minh City for consumption.
No infections have been detected in the Central Highlands province of Dak
Lak. The provincial veterinary agency has taken drastic measures to protect
more than 5.5 million poultry against viral infection. "We have dispatched
staff to hamlets and villages to disinfect breeding farms," said Nguyen
Khac Chuyen, head of the provincial veterinary agency. "We have also
stopped permitting the transport of live ducks and duck products between
districts and from Dak Lak to other neighboring provinces."
According to the Veterinary Department, the bird flu outbreak has been
reported in 20 communes and 15 districts of 7 cities and provinces, namely,
Lam Dong, Binh Phuoc, Ben Tre, Tien Giang, Long An, Dong Thap and Can Tho.
