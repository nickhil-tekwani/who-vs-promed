It is unlikely that improvements in water supply and sanitation will have a
major impact on epidemiology of rotavirus infection. Direct
person-to-person transmission appears to be the major route of spread of
this virus rather than via water or food. The ease of transmission in day
cares is not merely the result of poor hand-washing technique on the part
of toddlers and staff. Asymptomatic carriage of rotavirus occurs, the viral
particles are excreted in enormous numbers during episodes of diarrhea and
the virus is extremely stable, persisting on surfaces for days if not
weeks. Like other viruses infecting mucosal surfaces (influenza,
rhinovirus), infection does not induce long lasting immunity so that re
infection is the rule. Although such re infections tend to be milder than
first infections, they can be symptomatic and certainly can lead to further
transmission. Vaccine seems a much more effective barrier to severe disease
caused by this intestinal pathogen, unlike others do depend on contaminated
water and food.
