St. Eustatius is currently experiencing an outbreak of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD), St. Eustatius Health Department official Gerwin Schobbe said. He said the disease is highly contagious and is usually contracted by children, but adults can also become infected.

HFMD is caused by the coxsackievirus, which is usually in a person's urine, saliva, and intestines. Children contract the virus easily because they sometimes put toys in their mouth that they share with others while playing. The virus can also spread through coughing, and when an infected person touches an object the virus remains on it. "The virus is very, very easily spread," Schobbe explained.

The symptoms usually start with a sore throat. Young children may sometimes experience a fever, and sores usually appear at the back of the inside of their mouth. The infected person can also develop rashes on the face and foot. The rashes, Schobbe explained, can turn into blisters that can spread and also lead to lesions on the buttocks, knees, and elbows as well as on different parts of a person's body.

By the time a person starts to experience symptoms, especially rashes on the skin, trace amounts of the virus would have already been left for others to come in contact with.

If a parents or guardians see that their child has a fever and/or sore throat, Schobbe advised them to keep the child at home so that the infectious cycle can be broken more easily. The Health Department is also advising persons to be hygienic by washing their hands, especially if a person is caring for someone that is infected. Schobbe also advised that toys be separated and disinfected on a regular basis so that the virus is not spread more easily amongst children. He cautioned that the virus can spread to another island if an infected person travels to that island.

"It is very important for everyone to understand that, although this one ailment might cause some discomfort, the ailment is not dangerous at all. There is no danger of anyone dying from it; there is no reason to be highly alarmed," Schobbe said.

There is no vaccine for the virus, and there is no real treatment for it, he noted. "The only thing that can be done is to support an infected child, as a sore throat may hinder a child's will to eat." He suggested popsicles, ice cream, or lozenges to help soothe the throat, as well as sufficient fluids/liquids.

Parents who see symptoms in their child are urged to take their child to the doctor so that the diagnosis can be confirmed. When visiting a house doctor with a child, parents are advised to walk with the child's vaccinations cards, so that the healthcare official knows that the child is properly vaccinated. "It's important to realise that a person or child does not need to have all the symptoms. A person can have some of the symptoms and still have the virus, and people with a little bad luck will have all the symptoms," Schobbe said.

Schobbe stressed that there is no reason to panic, as the sickness can be over within 7-10 days, and it is not life-threatening in any way. For additional information, persons may contact the St. Eustatius Health Department at +599 318 2891.

[Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is an acute and highly contagious viral exanthem that commonly affects children younger than 5 years. The infection can be symptomatic, and the clinical manifestations include mild fever with a characteristic vesicular eruption on the hands, feet, and oral cavity. Historically, HFMD is known as a self-limited disease process. However, recurrent outbreaks over the last 2 decades in the Asian and Pacific populations have caused severe illness and debilitating complications, even death. In addition, North American outbreaks were recently documented and have affected unexpected numbers of healthy adults and children [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5376252/].

HFMD is an acute viral illness commonly caused by coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16) and enterovirus 71 infections. Recently, atypical HFMD has been reported in association with CV-A6, an uncommon enterovirus strain [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5843477/]. It is unclear whether there are significant differences in the disease course and outcome of HFMD depending on the pathogen responsible.

Because treatment is mainly supportive, recognition and prevention play a vital role in limiting spread of HFMD and decreasing outbreaks. One way that physicians can help is to identify affected patients and educate them on preventive measures. Enteroviruses are shed in the stool for many weeks after initial infection, so good hand hygiene should be made a mandatory practice, especially in healthcare settings, daycare centers, and other places where outbreak is common. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend all affected patients and their close contacts to practice the following: frequent hand washing, especially after changing diapers and using the restroom; frequent disinfection of commonly used surfaces and objects; and avoiding close contact with infected individuals. These recommendations are simple tasks that play an important role in preventing further spread of infection.

St. Eustatius is an island in the Caribbean. It is a special municipality (officially "public body") of the Netherlands. - Mod.UBA
