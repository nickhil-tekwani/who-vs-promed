The Minnesota (MN) Department of Natural Resources has determined the cause of death of the over 100 geese that were found at Loon Lake in Waseca.

The DNR says the birds died of pneumonia, pulmonary aspergillosis, which is a fungal disease.

The source of the fungal infection is still unknown at the moment, but they said it is unusual for this disease to cause a mass die-off like this.

DNR speculates that the weather and fall migration may have made the birds more vulnerable.

The animals were also tested for avian flu, the results came back negative.

[The mold _Aspergillus_ spp. causes a common fungal infection in birds resulting in respiratory illness. Birds are commonly exposed to the spores of this fungus but only develop the respiratory disease under certain conditions. Aspergillosis may be induced by stress. Unusual climatic conditions or crowding might make birds more susceptible to developing respiratory disease following exposure to spores. - Mod.PMB
