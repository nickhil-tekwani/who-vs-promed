A man in the Luis "Chicho" Fabrega Hospital in Veraguas province is awaiting confirmation that he is infected by [a] hantavirus.

Eduardo Chong, chief of epidemiology of the Veraguas Ministry of Health (MINSA) reported on Tuesday [7 Jul 2015] this suspicious case of [a] hantavirus [infection] and said that they await the patient's results from the laboratory.

Chong explained that in addition to the verification [by the laboratory], they found virus infection risk factors in the environment where the patient resides. According to MINSA statistics, 2 confirmed cases of hantavirus [infections], one death and 2 suspicious cases [in the province] have been registered in 2015.

[This is the 2nd case of a hantavirus infection in Veraguas province this year (2015). Most cases in Panama this year that ProMED-mail has posted have occurred in Los Santos province. The hantavirus responsible for this and previous cases is not mentioned, and the report above does not describe the situation in which the infection was acquired.

Los Santos province is endemic for Choclo virus. As noted in the comment for the previously posted Los Santos cases (ProMED-mail archive no. 20150204.3140834), Choclo virus is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be in Panama that causes hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. There were 75 cases of presumed Choclo virus infection last year (2014), and case numbers have begun to mount again this year (2015).

Elimination of trash and food sources that attract and harbor the rodent reservoir, as well as careful cleanup practices to avoid production of aerosolized virus-contaminated materials, such as rodent excreta, will help to prevent exposure and infection. The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents are found in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings.
