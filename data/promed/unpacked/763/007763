Probe on acute gastroenteritis outbreak in Tenom
------------------------------------------------
Sabah health authorities are probing a slew of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) cases in the interior Tenom district where at least 74 people have come down with abdominal pain and vomiting since Tuesday [2 Jan 2023]. A viral video that surfaced in Facebook on Thursday [5 Jan 2023] also claimed that many residents in Tenom were experiencing diarrhea.

In response, Sabah health director Datuk Dr Rose Nani Mudin said the Tenom district health office received 74 notifications of AGE incidents on Thursday [5 Jan 2023].

It involved patients aged between 1 and 65, she said, adding that all experienced stomach ache and vomiting while only 20% came down with diarrhea and 16% with fever. She said the earliest case was detected on Tuesday [2 Jan 2023], with all patients thus far only receiving outpatient treatment.

"Fifteen were treated at government facilities while 59 at private medical facilities.

"All the cases were reported to be stable and some patients have also recovered," she said in a statement on 6 Jan 2023.

Dr Rose said they are still trying to zero in on what had caused the AGE incidents, adding that initial investigations found that the patients resided in separate localities. The probe also found that some patients had consumed raw water that had not been boiled.

"We took water samples from the Senagang, SRO Kalang and Auxillary Amboi 1 water treatment plants. Physical observation by Tenom health officers at the plants on Thursday [5 Jan 2023] found that the water seemed clear and there were no parameter breaches on the turbidity, chlorine, pH and temperature levels. Further tests will be carried out on the water supply at the plants to ascertain whether there is any presence of virus microorganisms," Dr Rose said.

Health officials have also taken stool samples from patients who were treated at the government hospitals to be tested for microorganisms.

This is in addition to the samples of food consumed by the patients earlier.

"The patients who came for treatment at the private and government facilities have been given health awareness (on AGE)," she said, adding that the Sabah Health Department will continue monitoring the situation at all its medical facilities statewide.

Towards this end, Dr Rose advised the public to take heed of the measures, such as only consuming boiled water as well as maintaining good personal [hygiene], so that they would not fall victim to the illness. She said people should also store food items in places which are clean and with the right temperature.
