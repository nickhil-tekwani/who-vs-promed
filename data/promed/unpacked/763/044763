We recently reported a case of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) [see reference below]. Here, we report a case of human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA). The patient lived in Gangwon Province, South Korea. The patient reported that fever developed 5 days after she noticed a tick-bite. A 3-cm diameter, erythematous maculopapular lesion [a flat, red area on the skin covered with small merged bumps] was observed around the tick-bite site.

Laboratory tests showed pancytopenia [a reduction in the number of red and white blood cells as well as platelets] and elevated serum aminotransferase levels. Test results for antibodies to _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, _Hantaan_ virus, and _Leptospira_ were negative. RT-PCR for SFTS virus was also negative. The diagnosis of HGA was confirmed by a 4-fold increase in IgG antibody titers to _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ by IFA. A PCR assay also yielded a positive band, and analysis of the sequence data showed over 99.3 percent similarity with _A. phagocytophilum_. The patient recovered with doxycycline treatment.

We confirmed a case of HGA in South Korea. When a patient develops acute fever with thrombocytopenia [a decrease in platelets] after tick-bite, HGA as well as SFTS and scrub typhus should be considered as a differential diagnosis.

[For a discussion of human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), see moderator ML's comments in a recent ProMED-mail post "Anaplasmosis - USA: (ME) increased incidence," Archive Number: 20120811.1239966.

HGA is an emerging tick-borne infectious disease caused by _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ that was 1st recognized in the United States in 1990 (Chen S-M, Dumler JS, Bakken JS, Walker DH. Identification of a granulocytotropic _Ehrlichia_ species as the etiologic agent of human disease. J Clin Microbiol. 1994;32:589-95). Serological and molecular evidence have also suggested that human infection exists in South Korea, Japan, and China. In 2008, L. Zhang et al reported the 1st cases of HGA in China and likely nosocomial person-to-person transmission of HGA from direct contact with the index patient's blood or respiratory secretions (Zhang L, Liu Y, Ni D, et al. Nosocomial Transmission of Human Granulocytic Anaplasmosis in China. JAMA. 2008;300(19):2263-2270; Available at: http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=182918). Although seroepidemiological studies in febrile patients indicated the presence of HGA in South Korea (Heo EJ, Park JH, Koo JR et al. Serologic and molecular detection of _Ehrlichia chaffeensis_ and _Anaplasma phagocytophila_ (human granulocytic ehrlichiosis agent) in Korean patients. J Clin Microbiol. 2002 Aug;40(8):3082-5), the above report is likely the 1st clinical description of a case of HGA in South Korea.

The following paragraph is extracted from the Zhang et al publication, http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=182918:

"_A. phagocytophilum_ transmission in China and Asia is predicated on the presence of this zoonotic agent in vector ticks and vertebrate hosts. Although studies in Asia are limited, at least 8 have examined _A. phagocytophilum_ infection of ticks, including 2284 _Ixodes persulcatus_ ticks, of which 4.4 percent carried _A. phagocytophilum_ DNA, a prevalence similar to that in European and North American _Ixodes_ species ticks (12,14,21-27). Likewise, 9 percent and 24 percent of _Apodemus_ species field mice in northern China and Korea, respectively, and 64 percent of _Crosidura lasiura_ shrews in Korea are infected (13,21,24,28-29). Although no proven cases of HGA have been previously identified in China, at least one study describes _A. phagocytophilum_ DNA in the blood of 4 Chinese patients with tick bites (14,30), and seroepidemiological investigations demonstrate that 2 percent to 9 percent of febrile patients in Korea (10-11) and between 0.5 percent and 6 percent of healthy Chinese residents have _A. phagocytophilum_ antibodies (31)."

Gangwon Province, with a population of 1.5 million residents, is located in northeastern South Korea, bounded on the north by North Korea. 4/5ths of the province is woodland.
