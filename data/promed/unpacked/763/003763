The deadly drug-resistant strain of tuberculosis has claimed its 1st
life in the Western Cape and 5 new sufferers have been diagnosed.
This brings to 8 the number of people identified with "extensively
drug-resistant" tuberculosis -- XDR TB -- in the province so far.
Dr. Keith Cloete, director of TB for the province, said a 23-year-old
Cape Town woman had died in the Brooklyn Chest Hospital on 5 Feb
2007, but XDR TB had only been diagnosed after death.
In 2006, this strain killed more than 50 people in KwaZulu-Natal and
more than 300 cases have been confirmed countrywide.
Four of the 5 new local cases have been admitted to Brooklyn Chest
Hospital, where they are being treated in isolation along with the
1st 2 cases, an 11-month-old baby from Khayelitsha and a 43-year-old
woman from the Eastern Cape, who fell ill while visiting Cape Town
over Christmas.

[Many of the initial cases described in KwaZulu-Natal also died
before the diagnosis of XDR TB was made. This reflects the rapid
progression of the disease when not treated properly and the
co-infection (in almost all) with HIV.
The presence of XDR TB in an 11-month-old child underscores the
observation that much of the disease is due to acquisition of the
resistant bug, not selection of resistance in a patient non-adherent
to therapy for an initially more sensitive mycobacterium. Young
children with TB usually mean active disease in close family members
or other caretakers.
