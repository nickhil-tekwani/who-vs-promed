Avian influenza - autopsy report
--------------------------------
In a soon-to-be-released issue of a scientific journal, researchers from
Thailand and Hong Kong will report the findings of an autopsy of a 6 year
old Thai boy who died from avian influenza. Scheduled for publication in
the July 2005 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/index.htm>, their findings of an atypical
pattern of infection -- deep in the lungs, away from the tracheal lining
where virus could easily be coughed out at others -- may help explain why
avian H5N1 influenza virus doesn't yet spread easily among people.
But the very fact that a paper containing autopsy data from a single case
is still desirable to journal editors a year-a-half into the H5N1 avian
influenza outbreak underscores a problem that has been plaguing the
scientific world's pursuit of knowledge about this [potentially] dangerous
strain of avian influenza virus. While at least 54 people have died from
H5N1 infections since December 2003, autopsies have been performed on fewer
than a handful of cases. For cultural and other reasons, body after body
has been buried or cremated, robbing pathologists of the precious chance to
chart the havoc the virus wreaks on its victims.
"That's one of the reasons why it's so difficult to understand what the
virus does in the body," says Dr Klaus Stohr, who heads the World Health
Organization's global influenza program. "Did it do more damage on the
intestine? Is the heart affected? Encephalitis: Yes? No? What is the damage
in the lung? That's why postmortems are so important. But ... there are
less than 5 done, I think, so far. And all in Thailand." Thailand hasn't
reported a human case in the most recent wave of infections, which began in
December 2004. That means science has no autopsy data with which to try to
explain the worrisome changes in infection patterns that have been observed
over the last 6 months in Viet Nam, changes which flu experts fear mean the
virus is becoming more transmissible and more likely to spark an influenza
pandemic.
Without information that can only be gathered through autopsies, scientists
devising treatment options and potential vaccines are working, if not in
the dark, then in a dim light, experts say. "If we want to test vaccine or
antiviral strategies for intervention, we would like to know what the
disease looks like in humans," explains Ab Osterhaus, head of virology at
the Eramus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Drugs and vaccines
are tested in animals before being administered to people. But without
having a clear picture of what the disease does in humans, it's difficult
to select the appropriate animal model, Osterhaus says. Animals used as
models must experience a pattern of infection that closely mimics human
disease in order for scientists to feel secure that what they are learning
might apply to people. Determining which organs the virus is attacking is
also crucial from an infection control point of view, because it helps
identify possible modes of transmission. In some [avian] species, massive
amounts of the H5N1 virus are excreted in feces, Osterhaus notes.
Excreted virus isn't a threat with human flu viruses. But if H5N1
replicates in the human gastrointestinal tract, patients who experience
diarrhea could contaminate their environments in ways health care workers
might not expect from a respiratory virus. "So that's very important
information," Osterhaus says.
The autopsy on the Thai boy found viral replication in the intestine.
Autopsies could also show whether the virus is being spread through the
blood supply to other organs, says the Toronto pathologist who performed
the 1st autopsy done on a SARS patient in Canada. "You want to see whether
the cause is in the blood supply and therefore may be a systemic or
body-wide problem, or if it's organ-specific," explains Dr Jagdish Butany,
who insists autopsies provide a wealth of information for those who treat
patients and those who study viruses. "The information we continue to get
out of autopsies is totally unbelievable [sic!]," says Butany, a
pathologist at the city's University Health Network. But he acknowledges
that, in certain cultures and religions, getting permission from relatives
to conduct autopsies is virtually impossible. And in steamy climates like
that of Southeast Asia, prompt disposal of corpses is the norm.
Even if more people were willing to authorize postmortems, there is another
problem, notes Earl Brown, a virologist who specializes in influenza
virulence at the University of Ottawa. H5N1 influenza isn't claiming its
victims fast enough. "The problem is you have to wait for the people to
die, and they're just not dying early enough," Brown explains. "They die
after several weeks in intensive care, and all the (viral) tracks are gone.
Getting people who die from rapid, fulminant disease early to look at when
everything's sort of fresh is the trick."

[This article contains arguments for and against the value of autopsies in
understanding disease processes following infection of humans by avian
influenza viruses. As a virologist, the constraints expressed by Dr Earl
Brown seem to me to have the most relevance. Others may come to different
conclusions. - Mod.CP]
