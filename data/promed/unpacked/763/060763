Highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry in Thailand
--------------------------------------------------------

New outbreak: An outbreak occurred in Nakhon Phanom province at Muang
village on 24 Jul 2006. There were 5500 susceptible birds with 2241 cases
and deaths resulting in the destruction of 3259 birds.
Description of affected population: layer chickens in a conventional medium
size farm with typically low biosecurity.
Laboratory where diagnostic tests were performed: Upper Northeastern
Regional Veterinary Research and Development Centre, Department of
Livestock Development, Konkean province
Results: virus isolation; haemagglutination inhibition test on 29 Jul 2006
was positive for H5
Laboratory where diagnostic tests were performed: National Institute of
Animal Health virus isolation
Results: real-time PCR on 1 Aug 2006 was positive for H5N1
Source of outbreak or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.
Control measures undertaken:
stamping out in the affected premises, with 75 per cent compensation;
quarantine;
movement control inside the country;
screening (cloacal swab sampling in a 5 km radius zone around the infected
premises involving 11 917 poultry [10 502 native chickens, 902 ducks, 267
layers and 228 other poultry] of 734 farmers);
zoning;
disinfection of the affected premises, all infected/contaminated materials
and high-risk areas;
dipping/spraying.
Other details/comments:
- Nakhon Phanom Provincial Livestock Office has declared the whole of Muang
district as an HPAI infected area, which allows the authorities of the
Department of Livestock Development to conduct full-scale disease control
measures.
- active clinical surveillance in a 10 km radius zone, with a ban on the
movement of poultry for a period of 30 days from 26 Jul 2006, the date on
which disinfection of the affected premises was completed. There are 47 367
poultry (43 666 native chickens, 2562 ducks, 282 layers and 228 other

[A map of Thailand and its provinces can be seen at
<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/thailand.pdf> and
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Thailand>, respectively.
In the last month, there have been avian outbreaks in Phichit and
Phitsanulok provinces (almost exactly in the center of the non-peninsular
parts of the country) and Nakohn Panom (the extreme north east). Since this
outbreak does not appear to involve large commercial operations, it is
important to understand reasons for the occurrence of the disease in birds
from quite separate parts of the country. What is called for here is some
good old-fashioned "shoe leather" epidemiology to begin to discern whether
and to what extent the disease is being transferred by fighting cocks,
smallholder commerce, or other means. If the disease is really widespread
-- as some suspect -- then correlating the occurrence with human cases as
they are confirmed provides important, basic data for the epidemiologist. -
