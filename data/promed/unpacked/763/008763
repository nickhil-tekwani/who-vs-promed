To recapitulate:
Three cases of malignant anthrax were registered in Uspenskaya village
between 12th and 16th July after three people took part in the slaughter of
an infected cow. One of these cases died.
The vet who examined the cow failed to recognize the disease and did not
put a special warning brand on the cow's hide. [The first report had the
veterinarian doing only an antemortem inspection. The cow was brought to a
sausage plant in the village of Losevo, Krasnodar Territory. Since there
was no warning on the cow, the meat was sent on for processing. Sausage
made from the cow was included in a consignment sent to the towns of Sochi,
Cherkessk and the village of Krasnogvardeyskiy in Stavropol Territory.
Now, read on:
Officials Deny Any Anthrax Epidemic
Russian health officials in Moscow and Krasnodar region were insisting
Friday that there is no threat or likelihood of an anthrax epidemic among
humans, after a man believed to be infected with the disease died in
southern Russia [and the carcass of an infected cow was made into sausages.
A slaughterhouse worker died last Friday [17th July, and two of his
colleagues are being tested for anthrax after they came into contact with
an infected cow in the Krasnodar region. [The Russians use a cutaneous
Anthracin test to diagnose human anthrax. MHJ A further nine people who
had come into contact with the infected animal have tested negative for
anthrax, said Nikolai Troshin, head of Krasnodar's veterinary service.
[Presumably they have no fever nor evidence of a cutaneous lesion. MHJ
The sausages produced from the infected meat have been destroyed, the
slaughterhouse has been disinfected, and cattle in Uspenskoye are being
vaccinated against anthrax. "We have covered all our bases," said Troshin.
Valentina Zemlyanskaya of the Krasnodar region sanitary and epidemiological
inspectorate said the last outbreak of anthrax in the region she could
recall was 15 years ago. According to Zemlyanskaya, until biological tests
are completed, no one can be certain that it was anthrax that caused the
worker's death. But she added that "regardless of the tests' results, it's
an emergency situation" and that "the first suspect undoubtedly is anthrax."
The infected animal, slaughtered July 7 in the village of Uspenskoye, was
sent to a meat-processing factory and made into sausage, which was later
sold in stores in the Krasnodar region towns of Sochi, Cherkessk and
Krasnogvardeisky. Troshin said the infected cow was accepted at the
slaughterhouse after the farmer who owned it deceived a local veterinarian
into believing it was healthy. Worried that the animal would be rejected,
he bought the entrails of a freshly slaughtered cow and inserted them into
the carcass of his animal. After an examination, the veterinarian approved
the meat and allowed it to be sent to the sausage factory, according to
Troshin. "This is called cheating," he said, adding that a criminal charge
against the cow's owner case has been opened.
Under Russian law, workers who come into contact with raw meat are supposed
to be vaccinated against anthrax, but the three who contracted the disease
were not. "Today, everything is like this. Nobody has control anymore,"
said Troshin. "There are shashlyk stands at every corner. Ask
shashlyk-makers if they are vaccinated - I bet they are not."

[The mind boggles. To use a Royal Navy phrase, there is clearly a lot of
yard-arm clearing going on here to distance any officials from blame. In
lethal cases of anthrax, diagnosis is quick and straightforward so why the
delay. We had a live animal inspected and now it was inspected post-mortem
after viscera had been inserted into the carcass -- I defy anyone to be
able to do that with a dead cow -- and the vet apparently failed to notice
that the carcass was fevered but the viscera were normal -- if this tale
were true. This Russian (and Soviet) reliance on human vaccination to
protect those in the slaughtering trades indicates the abject failure of
their veterinary programme; if their livestock vaccination & control
procedures worked there is negligible human risk of disease; all modern
countries limit human vaccination, if used, to those in bone meal plants
and wool & hair mills. And there is an apparent demand to vaccinate
shashlyk vendors to protect them in case they are selling infected meat on
the street. I very much doubt that the last outbreak of bovine anthrax in
Krasnodar was as much as 15 years ago. - Mod.MHJ
