Rabies confirmed in boy
--------------------
In a major blow for his family, it has been confirmed that a 4-year-old boy who is fighting for his life at Durban's Prince Mshiyeni Hospital had contracted rabies. The boy from Umlazi was hospitalised early last month [May 2012] and was in the hospital's high-care unit after being bitten by a dog, which later died.

Medical authorities had been puzzled because although the boy had exhibited symptoms of rabies, successive tests conducted on him showed up negative. The corpse of the dog was dug up last week and tests have now confirmed that it had rabies.

The boy's mother has been at her son's bedside where he has been lying in a coma for the past 5 weeks. She said she was not aware that her son had been bitten by a dog but had rushed him to the hospital after his health started deteriorating. "It is very sad to see him like this. He was a lively child who was always playful. I have been praying all this time, and now his fate lies with God," she said.

The chances of her son surviving are very low, as most people suffering from rabies die within weeks of infection. At least 3 people are known to have died of rabies in KwaZulu-Natal in the past 3 months. In May 2012, an 8-year-old child from Bergville died of rabies after being bitten by a rabid dog in April 2012. An elderly woman from Ngonyameni, south of Durban, also died after being bitten by a dog. Two weeks ago, the life support system of an Underberg farmer and canoeist was switched off after he was brain damaged by rabies. He had spent 5 weeks in a private Pietermaritzburg hospital after being bitten by an infected dog.

A resident of Ngonyameni, which is very close to Umlazi, said he had taken all 4 of his dogs to be vaccinated a few weeks ago. "We don't know where this rabies thing comes from, because we always vaccinated our dogs. It could be that a dog from another area came in here to infect our dogs."

Meanwhile, the campaign to vaccinate thousands of dogs and cats against rabies in KZN by the end of this month [June 2012], started yesterday [26 Jun 2012] in one of Durban's largest residential townships, Phoenix, where the pet population is high. Despite massive media and awareness campaigns against rabies, new suspected cases keep emerging, prompting the MEC to order his field workers to go on a door-to-door campaign and vaccinate animals in their homes. Having kicked off in Phoenix, the vaccination campaign will move to Merebank where field workers will conduct a 4-day vaccination programme. The programme will then proceed to rural areas such as Inkandla, KwaMbonambi and Impendle in Pietermaritzburg.

[Tragically, the human death toll in Kwazulu-Natal continues to rise despite increasing awareness of the need for comprehensive vaccination of the domestic dog population and routine administration of post-exposure prophylaxis.
