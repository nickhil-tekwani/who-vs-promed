A short comment on your report about dengue in Ecuador. I do not wish to fall
into the trap of assessing and/or accepting newspaper reports purportedly
based on information from the National Malaria Erradication Service. For
your information, I have just reviewed official data from the National
Epidemiology Department of the Ministry of Health [Ecuador] which reveals
that there have been just fewer than 30,000 cases of dengue between 1990 and
1996. Obviously, if there were 1,970,000 cases in 1988 and 1989 as your
reference article suggests, we would have heard of them before. During 1997,
the provinces mentioned, as well as Canar Province, have high _Aedes aegypti_
indices, which facilitate dengue transmission. The great majority of the
cases reported in 1997 are based on clinical diagnoses.

[Thanks to Dr. Carter. It appears that the number of cases in Ecuador is
more reasonable than reported in El Comercio. Numbers of cases
notwithstanding, there appears to be an on-going epidemic of dengue in
Ecuador. Irrespective of Ecuador, the words "success" and "competence" do
not come to mind immediately. If anyone knows the serotypes involved and can
speak to the likelihood of appearance of dengue hemorrhagic fever in Ecuador,
please let us know. -- Mod CHC]
