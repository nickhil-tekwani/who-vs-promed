Two cases of botulism reported in Gyumri, Armenia
-------------------------------------------------
Two residents in Armenia's 2nd-largest city of Gyumri in the northwestern province of Shirak were hospitalized with botulism, a disease that usually occurs after eating improperly cooked or preserved foods. The ministry of health said an epidemiological examination found that a possible cause of poisoning is either preserved peppers or a home-made eggplant product.

According to the ministry, the day after eating these foods the patients developed symptoms of botulism -- nausea, vomiting, asthma and blurred vision and were hospitalized at a hospital in Gyumri, where they were given appropriate medical care. "At this moment, their condition is regarded as moderate. The treatment continues," the ministry said.

The ministry of health issued a statement saying in order to avoid botulism, home-made preserves must be boiled for 20-25 minutes before eating. It also said citizens must not buy preserved foods in the market or from random people.

Botulism cases in Armenia occur usually in winter when many families start eating home-made preserved food, despite the health ministry's warning against using such food or its instructions to at least thoroughly cook such food by boiling it for 20-25 minutes to destroy the botulism toxin.

[When botulism does occur related to food, it is most likely to be home-prepared as in this case. It should be noted that in typical foodborne botulism, the toxin is preformed in the food when ingested. Infant botulism (and its very rare adult equivalent, adult intestinal toxemia botulism) is caused by ingestion of spores, which germinate, and toxin is formed _in situ_. - Mod.LL
