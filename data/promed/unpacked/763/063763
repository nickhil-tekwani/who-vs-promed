I am pleased to share an article which may be interesting for
[ProMED-mail subscribers]. It is good that it was published before
World Rabies Day 2011. Definitely new technology and tools give us new
hope for making rabies history.

Abstract
--------
"There are 11 Member States in the WHO Southeast Asia region
(Bangladesh, Bhutan, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, India,
Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and East
Timor) of which 8 are endemic for rabies. More than 1.4 billion people
in the Region are at risk of rabies infection, and approximately 45
percent of worldwide rabies deaths occur in Asia. Dog bites account
for 96 percent of human rabies cases. Progress in preventing human
rabies through control of the disease in dogs has been slow due to
various factors. Innovative control tools and techniques have been
developed and standardized in recent years. The introduction of
cost-effective intradermal rabies vaccination regimens in Asian
countries has increased the availability and affordability of
postexposure prophylaxis. Elimination of rabies is not possible
without regional and intersectoral cooperation. Considering the
importance of consolidating achievements in rabies control in Member
countries, the WHO Regional Office for Southeast Asia has developed a
regional strategy for elimination of human rabies transmitted by dogs
in the Region. They have committed to provide technical leadership, to
advocate national health authorities to develop major stakeholder
consensus for a comprehensive rabies elimination programme, and to
implement national strategies for elimination of human rabies."

[ProMED-mail would like to thank GN Gongal for sharing the background
publication on rabies in Southeast Asia. In Table 1 of the publication
referred to above, the estimates on the number of dog bites annually
in India are approximately 17 400 000 with a resultant number of
rabies deaths estimated to be between 18 000 and 20 000 per year, with
an estimated population based rate of 18 cases per million population
in India. Hence the need for post-exposure prophylaxis in India is
evident. - Mod.MPP]
