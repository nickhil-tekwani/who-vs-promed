Up to 77 people in Japan -- most of them chicken farm workers -- may
have been infected with a mild form of bird flu, a news report said
on Tue 10 Jan 2006, citing government officials.
The sufferers came from 2 prefectures -- Saitama and Ibaraki --
outside of Tokyo, Kyodo News agency reported. Officials at the Health
Ministry refused to immediately confirm the report.
The Kyodo News Agency report stated the 77 showed evidence of
antibodies to the H5N2 virus, which is weaker than the deadly H5N1
form. None of them showed signs of the disease and there was no
danger that they would, the report said.

A total of 77 people in Japan, mostly chicken farm workers, may have
been infected with the H5N2 strain of avian influenza, in the world's
1st reported possible infection of humans with a strain weaker than
the deadly H5N1 variety, according to a Japanese government report
released Tuesday.
Antibody tests of their blood suggest the 77 people may have been
infected, but none had any symptoms or the virus itself, and there is
no danger of developing symptoms and infecting other people,
government officials said.
The Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry and the National Institute of
Infectious Diseases jointly tested 353 people comprising employees of
34 chicken farms in Ibaraki and Saitama prefectures that were earlier
hit by the H5N2 [epidemic] and others who may have been in contact
with infected poultry.
"This is the 1st time in the world that possible infections of humans
by the H5N2 strain was reported,"an official of the national
institute said. The 77 people comprised 65 employees of farms and 5
prefectural government employees who were engaged in epidemic control
work in Ibaraki, and 7 poultry farm employees in Saitama.
According to the report, the human infections probably took place
before the infections were detected in chickens in the areas. The
people were probably exposed to the virus while dealing with chickens
and their excrement without taking proper preventive measures, it
said. The Health Ministry said it asked the Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries Ministry and local governments to adopt preventive measures
such as advising workers at chicken farms to put on masks at work
even if no abnormalities have been found in their chickens.
Bird flu infection was first suspected in Japan in April 2004 at a
chicken farm in Kyoto Prefecture, which was hit by the H5N1 strain.
There was one human case of infection and 4 possible infections but
none of the people died.
