A man in the southwestern Chinese province of Guizhou has been
infected with bird flu and is in a critical condition in hospital,
the Health Ministry said on Sunday [25 Jan 2009]. It is the 6th human
case of bird flu to be reported in China this year [2009]. The
Chinese Health Ministry said on its website <http://www.moh.gov.cn>
that the latest victim was a 29-year-old man who fell sick on 15 Jan
2009. In recent weeks, 4 people have died of bird flu in China.
"Epidemiological tests show that the patient previously had exposure
to live poultry markets," the Ministry said in a brief statement. But
nobody with whom he had been in close contact had shown signs of
illness, it added.

Even before the latest case, Chinese health officials had been urging
extra vigilance this month [January 2009], when the winter weather
was suspected of having helped the virus spread. Other recent victims
fell ill in areas where there had been no known outbreaks of H5N1 in
birds. The H5N1 strain remains largely a virus among birds. Experts
say there is a danger that it may evolve into a form that can be
transmitted among humans, risking a pandemic in which millions could die.

Including the latest case, at least 36 people have been infected in
China, and 24 have died from H5N1 to date.

A 29-year-old man has been infected with bird flu in the 6th case in
China in just 3 weeks, state media said Sunday [25 Jan 2009],
sparking fears of an outbreak as the nation celebrates the Lunar New Year.

The patient fell ill on 15 Jan 2009 in the southwestern province of
Guizhou, the official Xinhua news agency reported, quoting local
health authorities. He tested positive for the deadly H5N1 strain of
the virus on Sunday [25 Jan 2009], and was still in a critical
condition, the report said. The patient is the 6th person to have
become infected with bird flu in 3 weeks. Four of those patients have
died from H5N1.

A 31-year-old woman succumbed to the disease on Friday [23 Jan 2009]
in northwest China's Xinjiang region, and a teenage boy died on
Tuesday [20 Jan 2009] in the central province of Hunan, although he
initially fell ill in Guizhou. On 17 Jan 2009, a 27-year-old woman
died from H5N1 in the eastern province of Shandong. The 1st fatality
of 2009 occurred on 5 Jan 2009 when a 19-year-old woman died in
Beijing, while a 2-year-old girl in northern China who fell
critically ill with the disease was on Friday [23 Jan 2009] said to
be out of danger.

The latest cases have prompted fears of a bird flu outbreak during
the Lunar New Year holiday, which started Sunday [25 Jan 2009] and
sees tens of millions of Chinese people on the move as they return
home for the festivities. The number of human victims in 2009 has
already exceeded the toll for last year [2008], when 3 people died,
all in January and February 2008.

Guizhou province has launched an emergency response against the
disease, and those who have come into close contact with the patient
are under medical observation, though none have fallen ill so far,
the Xinhua News Agency said. Cold weather encourages the spread of
the virus, and large swathes of China have been hit by sub-zero
temperatures in recent days.
