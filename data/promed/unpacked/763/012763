Bacillary diarrhea kills 3 children
-----------------------------------
3 children have died due to bacillary diarrhea [presumably
shigellosis - Mod.LL], which is spreading through the country,
hospital authorities said Wed, 26 May 2004.
"They came to the hospital at the last minute and death was due to
dehydration," Lady Ridgeway Hospital's Director Dr. Wimal Jayantha
told the Daily News. He said around 100 children were treated daily
at his Hospital during the last 3 days. "These types of cases have
been reported at the hospital beginning last week, but during the
last few days, the number of patients has clearly increased."
Dr. Jayantha said that generally, 50 patients are treated at the
hospital's diarrhea unit each day. But the number of patients with
this particular form of diarrhea has increased during the last few
days. Most of the patients are from Colombo and its suburbs.
