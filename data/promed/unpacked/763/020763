Polio outbreak - the Philippines [24 Sep 2019]
-----------------------
On [19 Sep 2019], the Philippines declared an outbreak of polio. Two cases have been reported to date, both caused by vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2). Environmental samples taken from sewage in Manila on [13 Aug 2019] and a waterway in Davao on [22 Aug 2019] have also tested positive for VDPV2.

The 1st case was confirmed on [14 Sep 2019] following testing by the National Polio Laboratory at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, the Japan National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID), and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The case-patient is a 3-year-old girl from Lanao del Sur in the southern Philippines. The virus isolated is genetically linked to VDPV2 previously isolated from environmental samples in Manila and Davao. This indicates that the virus is circulating.

The 2nd case was confirmed on [19 Sep 2019] and is a 5-year-old boy from Laguna province, approximately 100 km [62 mi] southeast of metro Manila. Investigations and further characterization of the virus are ongoing.

In addition, VDPV1 has also been isolated from environmental samples collected on [1 and 22 Jul 2019, and 13 and 27 Aug 2019] from Manila.

Vaccine-derived polioviruses are rarely occurring forms of the poliovirus that have genetically changed from the attenuated (weakened) virus contained in oral polio vaccine. They only occur when the vaccine virus is allowed to pass from person to person for a long time, which can only happen in places with limited immunization coverage and inadequate sanitation and hygiene. Over time, as it is passed between unimmunized people, it can regain the ability to cause disease. When the population is fully immunized with both oral polio vaccine and inactivated polio vaccine, this kind of transmission cannot take place. The gut immunity in people immunized with oral polio vaccine stops the virus from being passed on. Full immunization therefore protects against both vaccine-derived and wild polioviruses.

Public health response
1- Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and environmental surveillance are being enhanced to detect poliovirus.
2- Field investigation is currently underway in Lanao del Sur to define the geographic scope of the circulation of the virus and inform planning for outbreak response including mass immunization campaigns.
3- The Department of Health (DOH) reinforced its recommendation that all children should be vaccinated according to the routine immunization schedule.
4- WHO and other partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) are supporting the Department of Health and local health authorities in their detailed investigations and supporting efforts to enhance surveillance, strengthen routine immunization, communicate risk to the public, and implement outbreak response in line with internationally agreed polio outbreak response guidelines.

WHO risk assessment
WHO currently assesses the risk of international spread from the Philippines to be low. However, the risk of further spread within the Philippines is high due to limited population immunity (coverage of bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) was at 66% and 41%, respectively, in 2018) and suboptimal AFP surveillance.

WHO advice
It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contact with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for AFP cases in order to detect virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories, and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage to minimize the consequences of any possible poliovirus introduction or transmission.

WHO recommends that all travellers and residents in polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio.

As per the advice of an Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), the international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country infected by poliovirus should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency.

[This is the official WHO confirmation of the 2 previously reported cases of cVDPV paralytic disease in Philippines. Both cases have had a cVDPV2 isolated, but information as to whether the 2 isolates are genetically related or belong to 2 separate outbreaks of cVDPV2 in the country is still pending.

A good map showing the regions can be found at http://mapsof.net/philippines/philippines-regions-and-provinces. The 1st confirmed case came from Lanao del Sur in the southern part of the Philippines, whereas the 2nd case came from Laguna province located in the more northern part of the country approximately 100 km [62 mi] to the south of the Manila metropolitan area. - Mod.MPP]

Department of Health (DOH) undersecretary Eric Domingo said the 7 reported suspected cases of polio in Zamboanga Peninsula turned out to be negative for the virus, according to a report of GMA News' Unang Balita on Wednesday [25 Sep 2019].

DOH-Region IX initially suspected that these cases were due to poliovirus even as they waited for the results of the samples taken from the affected children that were sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine.

The mass vaccination against type 2 poliovirus will continue in Davao City, Davao del Sur, and Lanao del Sur.

The 1st human polio case recorded was that of a 3-year-old girl from Lanao del Sur. Health secretary Francisco Duque III earlier announced that polio has re-emerged in the Philippines after it was eradicated 19 years ago.

A sample from Davao River also turned positive for the type 2 poliovirus.

The DOH is now aiming to have 5.5 million children vaccinated as a measure against the rise of polio in the country.

[It's nice to have an immediate response to the media report on 7 additional suspected cases. In the future I shall refrain from reporting on pending cases, awaiting official confirmation (unless there is something highly suspicious about such a report - referring to other countries as well).

As a reminder, the Zamboanga peninsula is located in the south of the Philippines on Mindinao island, and to the west of Davao where environmental samples were positive for cVDPV. - Mod.MPP]

[3] The Philippines maintains polio-free status - media report
Date: Wed 25 Sep 2019

The Philippines is still considered polio-free despite 2 confirmed cases, the World Health Organization (WHO) said.

According to a report by Maki Pulido on 24 Oras on Wednesday [25 Sep 2019], the polio that has afflicted 2 children -- one in Lanao del Sur and the other in Laguna -- is not a wild poliovirus but a vaccine-derived virus that mutated from fecal waste and was passed on from one unvaccinated person to another.

"The occurrence of vaccine-derived polio-virus is not unique. We've had several outbreaks of vaccine-derived virus in the world, most recently in the Western Pacific region in Papua New Guinea and more recently in China," said WHO country representative Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe.

However, only vaccines for polio types 1 and 3 are being administered in the country, a problem as, the WHO earlier said, "[t]he polio outbreak in the Philippines is confirmed to be from a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2. This is of particular concern, as wild poliovirus type 2 was certified as globally eradicated in 2015."

Being fully vaccinated against polio means getting 3 doses of oral polio vaccine (OPV) and one injected dose of the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). Since the wild poliovirus type 2 was declared eradicated, the bivalent OPV only covers types 1 and 3. The IPV, on the other hand, protects against all 3 types of polio. Many Filipino children end up not getting the IPV - in fact, the DOH acknowledged that in recent years the vaccination coverage for the 3rd dose of the OPV had fallen to 95%, "the target required to ensure population protection against polio."

"What that means is if this virus that is causing vaccine-derived virus continues to circulate, even children who have completed the 3 doses of OPV and not taken the IPV are at risk of getting polio," said Abeyasinghe.

The DOH stressed, however, that children should still receive the bivalent polio vaccine for types 1 and 3, while the WHO and UNICEF will provide the Philippines with the monovalent vaccine for polio type 2. It is expected to arrive next month [October 2019]. At present, only 40% of Filipino children are vaccinated against type 2 polio.

The WHO also advised that apart from vaccinations, the best weapons against polio are proper hygiene and sanitation, clean water, and functional sewage systems.

[This media report addresses a question that begs an answer to explain why AFP cases confirmed to be associated with infection with cVDPVs (circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses) are not "counted" as polio cases. At the time of the initial development of the polio-eradication efforts, cVDPVs had not been identified. The vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP) cases had been seen in recipients of the vaccine and in susceptible contacts (parents, other family members) of recently vaccinated children. Reversion of neurovirulence of the OPV virus had not as yet been identified, not the least related to the laboratory studies available at the time. With the development of the genotyping of viruses, it opened the door to identifying vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs). As more and more countries were able to interrupt transmission of the wild poliovirus (WPV) through national vaccination campaigns supplementing routine vaccination activities, campaign fatigue set in, and routine vaccination services have not always been sufficient to maintain levels of coverages that prevent poliovirus circulation be it WPVs or VDPVs.

So we now have the dilemma of defining polio eradication: Is it eradication of all cases of paralysis associated with infections with any poliovirus (both cVDPVs and WPVs), or will the fight be considered over when there are no more cases of WPV-associated disease or WPV-positive environmental samples?

Right now, there is a dual system in place, the 1st being the fight against the WPV. If a country has reintroduction of WPV with sustained circulation, it will lose its polio-free status. But if a country has cVDPVs due to the same issue with reduced vaccination coverages, they do not lose their polio-free status, even though the reintroduction of mOPV2 (monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2) may interrupt the event that led to the use of the mOPV2, but may flood the environment with the vaccine virus that may ultimately revert to a cVDPV2 if the vaccination coverages are not brought up to a functional level. As a reminder, the antivaccine movement (or "vaccine hesitancy" movement) is growing through the use of social media and expanding its coverage in middle- and lower-income countries and adding to the antivaccine propaganda being spewed in areas with known civil unrest. This contributes to lowering the vaccination coverages, thereby leading to increased susceptibles in the communities paving the way for development of cVDPVs or for the reintroduction of the WPV from endemic areas.

A major conundrum, starting with the simple question of what is the definition of a polio-free country. - Mod.MPP
