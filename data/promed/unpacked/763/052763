A total of 4 people in a family in Gothenburg suffered from botulism, a very rare but dangerous type of food poisoning. For this reason, Eldsberga chark recalls its product "Suha Bosan Point", Smoked beef from Bosnia in Swedish.

The meat, totaling more than 40 kg [approx. 88 lb] - with Holland as its country of origin, - has been sold in bulk at, among other places, the Orient House between that [7 and 20 Nov 2017]. The meat has also been found in sandwiches sold by a baguette cafe.

Sime Trosic is the CEO of Eldsberga chark. "It's hell that someone may have suffered badly because of our products. I have children myself and can hardly describe how it would feel if they floated between life and death, " he said.

The revocation is made "for cautionary reasons" and according to the National Food Administration, it has not yet been established that botulism that the 4 family members suffered from was from the beef. The Authority continues to investigate the source of infection together with Goteborg's Environmental Management and Eldsberga Chark.

"According to the Swedish Food and Drug Administration, we can work as usual, they found no mistakes in our routines", says Sime Trosic. He urges customers who bought "Suha Bosan Point" during the current period of time to return it at the place of purchase.

The 4 affected family members have been discharged from the hospital and are improving. "I'm glad they're on the improvement path, that's most important", says Sime Trosic.

No further cases of botulism have been found.

[Most cases of foodborne botulism are not associated with commercially prepared food. Since all the cases were in one family, it is possible that the cases occurred related to poor storage with lack of refrigeration or other preparatory steps after purchase.
