The number of malaria cases around the Pos Kemar Orang Asli settlement in Gerik [Perak state], have gone up to 129, with 3 more people tested positive for the mosquito-borne disease on Tuesday [13 Dec 2016]. State Health, Public Transport, Non Islamic Affairs, National Integration and New Villages committee chairman Datuk Dr Mah Hang Soon said a total of 68 men and 61 women have contracted the disease. Mah said of the total, 16 patients have been admitted to Gerik Hospital.

"The rest are receiving treatment at Asrama Sri Didik and Pos Kemar settlement," he said after visiting 7 underprivileged patients who are recipients of the Khazanah IHH Healthcare Fund for cataract surgery at Pantai Hospital, here. He said 82 of the malaria patients have received full treatment and are now reported to be in stable condition. Mah said the authorities were still trying to pinpoint the source of the outbreak and had taken blood samples from the patients.

The malaria cases of the _Plasmodium vivax_ (_P. vivax_) strain were 1st detected in Pos Kemar on 16 Nov [2016], after 3 residents at the settlements were tested positive. The last malaria case reported in the area was in 2009.
