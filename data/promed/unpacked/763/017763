The 1st case of Usutu virus found in the _Culex Pipiens _ mosquito was detected in Genoa, the presence of which worries experts, so much so, that the Municipality has scheduled a disinfestation intervention for Wednesday [26 Oct 2022]. A larvicidal treatment will be done in drains and manholes in public areas or private buildings identified together with the ASL3 within the horticultural market on Semini street in San Quirico and in an area radius of 200 meters [656 ft] around it, which can be a source of reproduction.

In recent days, the deputy mayor Pietro Piciocchi signed an order following a joint inspection with ASL3 and the Experimental Zooprophylactic Institute of Piedmont and Liguria held in relation to the case of Usutu virus detected in a _Culex pipiens_ species mosquito captured near the plant Nursery Market.

The intervention will affect several streets: San Quirico station street, Girolamo Gastaldi street, Semini street, Tecci steet, Ottonelli stree, Polcevera street, San Quirico street and the Forestale bridge.

Usutu virus is mainly transmitted to animals [birds], more rarely to humans where it can cause neurological damage.

In a statement, the Councilor for Animals of the Municipality of Genoa, Francesca Corso declared that "There is a national plan from the Ministry of Health for monitoring viruses transmitted by arthropod vectors, such as mosquitoes. According to the Plan, we have control 'stations' in the potentially most exposed places, i.e. the port, the airport, the main hospitals and the horticultural market, due to the presence of imported plant species. A recent sampling in the vicinity of the market facilities triggered the procedure that involves disinfestation through a treatment that affects the larvae in wet places where they find a habitat for reproduction. I would like to say that in Liguria, unlike other regions where there is a presence of marshes, there is no important occurrence of the presence of pathogenic viruses transmissible to humans by insects: the latest reports of infections, in a case of dengue, date back to 2019 in citizens who came into contact with mosquitoes abroad. The bodies in charge of monitoring and preventing risks to human health, the Local Health Authority and the Zooprophylactic Institute, constantly monitor the situation and as a Municipality we are ready to take any measures to protect the health of citizens. To date, we have no evidence of further measures to be activated, but if the people in charge of public health control give us further information, we will proceed with punctuality ".

The 1st 2 Italian cases of human infection with Usutu virus (USUV), an arbovirus similar to the West Nile virus, have been identified in Friuli Venezia Giulia. The 2 patients are asymptomatic. The data is contained in the latest bulletin on the surveillance on West Nile and Usutu viruses carried out by the Istituto Superiore di Sanit√† updated on [9 Aug 2022].

Since the start of surveillance in early June [2022], the Usutu virus has also been identified in 58 mosquito pools and 7 birds in Emilia Romagna, Lombardy, Marche, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Umbria, Tuscany, Lazio, and Veneto. News circulated recently of 4 Usutu virus infections in the Frosinone area however was denied.

Usutu virus is a rare avian infection in humans. It has African origins and owes its name to a river -- the Great Usutu or Maputo -- in South Africa. Here, in fact, the virus was isolated for the 1st time, in a _Culex neavei_ mosquito. This virus is similar to West Nile, although the Usutu has so far circulated little among humans and the cases have not been serious. Conversely, this virus particularly attacks European birds (which, through migration, contribute to its spread), causing considerable deaths.

West Nile virus and Usutu virus are transmitted by vector insects (mosquitoes) to animals and humans and are not transmitted from human to human. Birds, both migratory and non-migratory, act as a "reservoir" for the virus. If bitten by a mosquito, the birds are able to infect the insect which in turn, by biting another animal or human, will transmit the virus to them.

Symptoms of the Usutu virus -- the most frequent ones encountered are fever, jaundice, and skin rash -- usually occur between 3 and 14 days after infection. This virus, like West Nile, can also cause neurological symptoms in humans.

[A 2019 retrospective study found cases of Usutu virus infection, some with serious disease, in their tests of samples from northern Italy taken the previous year (2018). There have been sporadic cases of Usutu virus infection in humans and wild birds in a wide geographic area in Central and southern Europe. The 1st human cases of USUV infection were detected in northern Italy in 2009 in immunocompromised patients (https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/ese.14.50.19446-en).

Subsequent seroprevalence studies and retrospective investigations suggested that the prevalence of USUV infection in humans could be higher than West Nile virus infection (estimated to range between 0.3% and 3%) in areas where both viruses co-circulate (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jmv.25230).

With USUV infections occurring in birds and in humans in Central Europe, it is not surprising that USUV human infections reoccur in Italy. Both USUV and WNV are flaviviruses. The above report underscores the need to be able to differentiate those cases from WNV cases. - Mod.TY
