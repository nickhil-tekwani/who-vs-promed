A family of "nightmare" bacteria -- untreatable and often deadly -- is spreading through hospitals across the USA, and doctors fear that it may soon be too late to stop them, senior health officials said Tue 5 Mar 2013. "These are nightmare bacteria that present a triple threat," said Thomas Frieden, director of the CDC. "They're resistant to nearly all antibiotics. They have high mortality rates, killing half of people with serious infections. And they can spread their resistance to other bacteria."

So far, this particular class of bacteria, called carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE, has been found only in hospitals or nursing homes, rather than in the community, Frieden said. But officials sounded the alarm partly because, if the bacteria's spread isn't contained soon, even common infections could become untreatable. The superbug tends to strike immune-compromised people who are hospitalized for a long time or living in a nursing home, Frieden said. And CRE doesn't spread easily from person to person, like the bacteria causing pink eye or strep throat.

They are "the biggest threat to patient safety in the hospital that we have," said Costi Sifri, an infectious disease physician and hospital epidemiologist at the University of Virginia Health System. "Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like anything is slowing their spread."

In 2001, only 1.2 percent of the common family of bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, were resistant to carbapenem antibiotics -- the strongest class available. By 2011, that figure had jumped to 4.2 percent. In the 1st half of 2012, nearly 200 hospitals treated at least one of these infections, Frieden said. About 4 percent of hospitals have had at least one patient with CRE, along with 18 percent of long-term, acute-care hospitals, the CDC said.

Those numbers could underestimate the scope of the problem, however. There are no reliable national data on CRE infections. There is no national requirement that hospitals and other health care facilities report CRE cases. CDC officials noted Tue 5 Mar 2013, that only 6 states require hospitals and other health care facilities to report CRE infections.

In November [2012], USA TODAY reported that CRE infections already are endemic in several USA population centers, including New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, which account for hundreds of confirmed cases. Smaller pockets of cases have been reported across much of the country, including Oregon, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and South Carolina.

Hospitals have fought these infections for years. An outbreak of the bacteria _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ killed 7 patients between 2011 and 2012 at the National Institutes of Health. Now, with these resistant bacteria found in 42 states, Frieden said he felt it was time to warn the public.

The country has only a narrow "window of opportunity" to act before it's too late to halt the spread, Frieden said.

When antibiotics no longer help a patient, doctors are resorting to alternatives, such as surgery to cut out infected tissue, said Sifri, who added that the country could be entering the beginning of the "post-antibiotic era."

Neil Fishman, associate chief medical officer at the University of Pennsylvania Health System, said doctors are now considering using old, outdated antibiotics that can damage the kidneys, because safer ones no longer work. "I've had to ask patients, 'Do you want a toxic antibiotic and end up on dialysis, or would you prefer to have a limb amputated?' " Fishman said.

Perhaps the greatest threat from CRE is its ability to share its resistance genes with other bacteria. So although CRE's spread is somewhat limited today, it could potentially share its resistance with far more common bacteria, such as _E. coli_, Frieden said. "It's not very often that our scientists come to me and say, 'We have a very serious problem and we need to say something to save lives,' but that is what is happening," said Frieden, who outlined a 6-step plan for hospitals, called "Detect and protect."

First, hospitals need to find out which, if any, of their patients have CRE, including patients transferred from other facilities. They should take precautions, such as wearing gloves and gowns, to prevent spreading the bug, even dedicating separate rooms, machines, and staff for those infected, Frieden said.

Hospital staff should remove invasive devices, such as catheters, as soon as possible. These devices can spread bacteria deep into the body, Frieden said. Lastly, doctors need to prescribe antibiotics more judiciously. About half of antibiotic prescriptions are either unnecessary or inappropriate, he said.

"We can't afford to wait until a large-scale outbreak occurs to fight these dangerous bacteria," said Sara Cosgrove, who serves on the board of Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. "Excessive antibiotic use combined with failure of health care workers to wash hands before and after caring for patients allows these bugs to develop and spread."

Patients and their families can help, too, by reminding everyone who enters the hospital room to wash their hands, Frieden said. Patients also should speak up if they have recently been in another hospital or foreign country, said Helen Boucher, a board member of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

There is little chance that an effective drug to kill CRE bacteria will be produced in the coming years. Manufacturers have no new antibiotics in development that show promise, according to federal officials and industry experts, and there's little financial incentive because the bacteria adapt quickly to resist new drugs.

The amazing overuse of our current antimicrobial armamentarium that I am currently observing in my clinical practice in the USA will no doubt serve as an efficient multiplier of these isolates just as intravenous drug abuse and sexual promiscuity facilitated the explosion of HIV 30 years ago. This misuse, in my opinion, is fed by the lack of control of antimicrobial usage in intensive care units and emergency care settings by intensivists and ER physicians who often react with unwisdom and "cookbook" protocols instead of using common sense and rational prescribing patterns. Once the patient moves out of the ICU or ER, the physicians do not even see the products of their unwise labors.

In the USA, reimbursements for medical care are based on procedures, not thought processes. Until the power of therapeutic nihilism is recognized, that is, using these agents only when rational, in combinations that make sense, and in settings where therapeutic interventions can have the ability to produce measurable and meaningful improvement in a patient's life, the medical community will continue down the slippery slope into an era where no therapeutic options will exist. - Mod.LL]

[Carbapenems are a class of beta-lactam antibiotics that includes ertapenem, doripenem, imipenem, and meropenem. Carbapenems historically have been antibiotics of last resort to treat many infections due to carbapenem-sensitive, but otherwise multidrug-resistant Gram negative bacilli, such as those that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) or AmpC beta-lactamases, which are enzymes that destroy most beta-lactams, except for the carbapenems.

Resistance to carbapenems develops commonly because organisms acquire the ability to produce carbapenemases, enzymes that destroy the carbapenems. There are several distinct types of carbapenemase: KPCs; NDM (New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase); IMP; VIM (Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase); and OXA-types (oxacillin-hydrolyzing carbapenemases). KPCs are the most common carbapenemases in the U.S., but have also been reported worldwide.

Many of the carbapenemases are encoded on plasmids, pieces of DNA that can easily spread from one organism to another of the same or even different bacterial species. KPCs (such as, KPC-1, -2, -3, -4, etc.) were first found in _K. pneumoniae_ isolates (hence, the name) and were subsequently found in _Escherichia coli_, _Serratia marcescens_, _Klebsiella oxytoca_, _Citrobacter freundii_, _Enterobacter_ spp., _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, and _Salmonella enterica_. The plasmids frequently carry genes that confer resistance to multiple other classes of antibiotics, so that these organisms have been susceptible only to toxic and otherwise suboptimal antibiotics.

Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) can colonize the gastrointestinal systems of humans for prolonged periods and once introduced can spread through contamination of water sources, hands of health care personnel, and environmental surfaces (for example bed rails, IV poles, computer touchpads, and equipment used to monitor vital signs such as stethoscopes, blood pressure cuffs, etc.) within health care facilities (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6124a3.htm?s_cid=mm6124a3_e).

CRE are easy to transfer from patient to patient. Hand hygiene is key to prevent the spread of these organisms and any other multidrug resistant microorganism. Infection control interventions in healthcare facilities aimed at preventing transmission of these multi-drug resistant isolates include their rapid recognition by the microbiology laboratory when cultured from clinical specimens, placement of patients colonized or infected with these isolates on contact precautions, and in some circumstances, conducting point prevalence surveys or active-surveillance cultures of high-risk patients and their environment (CDC, Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee. Management of multidrug-resistant organisms in healthcare settings, 2006. Atlanta, GA: US Department of Health and Human Services, CDC, Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee; 2007. Available at http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/guidelines/MDROGuideline2006.pdf). Active case detection may be followed by cohorting staff and CRE patients (i.e., segregating CRE-colonized or CRE-infected patients and the health-care personnel who care for them from those without CRE and the health-care personnel who care for them) (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm62e0305a1.htm?s_cid=mm62e0305a1_w). - Mod.ML
