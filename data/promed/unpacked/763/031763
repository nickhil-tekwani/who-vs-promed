Abstract
--------
Background
Remdesivir is an RNA polymerase inhibitor with potent antiviral activity in vitro and efficacy in animal models of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Methods
We conducted a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial involving hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, oxygen saturation of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air, and radiologic evidence of pneumonia. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive intravenous remdesivir for either 5 days or 10 days. All patients received 200 mg of remdesivir on day 1 and 100 mg once daily on subsequent days. The primary end point was clinical status on day 14, assessed on a 7-point ordinal scale.

Results
In total, 397 patients underwent randomization and began treatment (200 patients for 5 days and 197 for 10 days). The median duration of treatment was 5 days (interquartile range, 5 to 5) in the 5-day group and 9 days (interquartile range, 5 to 10) in the 10-day group. At baseline, patients randomly assigned to the 10-day group had significantly worse clinical status than those assigned to the 5-day group (P=0.02). By day 14, a clinical improvement of 2 points or more on the ordinal scale occurred in 64% of patients in the 5-day group and in 54% in the 10-day group. After adjustment for baseline clinical status, patients in the 10-day group had a distribution in clinical status at day 14 that was similar to that among patients in the 5-day group (P=0.14). The most common adverse events were nausea (9% of patients), worsening respiratory failure (8%), elevated alanine aminotransferase level (7%), and constipation (7%).

Conclusions
In patients with severe COVID-19 not requiring mechanical ventilation, our trial did not show a significant difference between a 5-day course and a 10-day course of remdesivir. With no placebo control, however, the magnitude of benefit cannot be determined.

[In this study, the goal of the authors was to evaluate a shorter course of treatment that would reduce impact on health services and preserve more of the drug, allowing for treating a larger number of patients with limited supplies. The study enrolled individuals in 55 hospitals in the United States, Italy, Spain, Germany, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan between 6 and 26 Mar 2020. Patients were enrolled in either 5 or 10 day treatment courses with a higher proportion of more severe disease presentation in the 10 day course.

The authors concluded: "Our trial did not show a significant difference in efficacy between a 5-day course and a 10-day course of intravenous remdesivir treatment in patients with severe COVID-19 due to SARS-CoV-2 who did not require mechanical ventilation at baseline. Patients who progress to mechanical ventilation may benefit from 10 days of remdesivir treatment; further evaluation of this subgroup and of other high-risk groups, such as immunocompromised persons, is needed to determine the shortest effective duration of therapy."

So, perhaps the take away message is that it is safe to treat for 5 days in patients not experiencing severe disease. - Mod.MPP]

ref: Anderson RM, Vegvari C, Truscott J, Collyer BS. Challenges in creating herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection by mass vaccination. Lancet. 2020. Online First
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vaccines to protect against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have risen up the agenda of most policy makers and individuals as the 2nd wave of COVID-19 in northern hemisphere countries grows and there is increasing pressure on healthcare systems. For any licensed vaccine, efficacy and duration of protection are key issues. Vaccine efficacies to protect against infection above 80% are desirable,[1] but duration of protection will remain uncertain for a number of years post licensure of COVID-19 vaccines. Preliminary evidence suggests waning antibody titres in those who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection,[2] but antibodies are only one part of the human immune response and acquired immunity to reinfection or the prevention of disease when reinfected.[3, 4, 5] Data on immunity to other coronaviruses suggest that immunity to SARS-CoV-2 might be short lived, perhaps 12-18 months in duration. [6] Whether past infection will prevent severe COVID-19 on re-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is not known at present.

Presently 45 candidate COVID-19 vaccines are in clinical trials in humans and 10 of these vaccines are in phase 3 trials,[7, 8] with expectations that some results might be announced before the end of 2020. If the results of the phase 3 trials are satisfactory, wide-scale deployment of COVID-19 vaccines is not expected until mid to late 2021.[7] Developing the structure of a within-country immunisation programme will be crucial, including defining priorities for receiving vaccination, solving distribution challenges, and encouraging public acceptance of vaccination. Addressing vaccine hesitancy will require good communication strategies on the value of being protected as an individual and the benefits for the community in reducing viral transmission.[9]

Many governments have plans for the priorities for vaccine distribution once supplies of COVID-19 vaccines become available.[10,11,12] Priority groups for vaccination typically start with front-line health-care staff, those working in essential services, those with health conditions that predispose to severe morbidity from infection, and then moving down the age groups from old to young in accordance with case fatality rates. A focus on immunisation in care homes for older people is planned in many countries, given the high number of COVID-19 deaths in these facilities during the 1st wave.

There is less clarity about the main priority of mass vaccination in the shorter term. Is it to minimise net mortality per year, or is it to maximise the average number of years of life gained by an individual receiving the vaccine? To maximise the average years of life gained, calculations need to be made using demographic and epidemiological data. For example, with the recorded case fatality rates in the UK during the 1st COVID-19 wave and with the UK demography, we estimate that vaccinating people older than 70 years in the UK saves more lives than focusing on those aged 50-70 years (appendix). The reason for this is the steep rise in the case fatality rates in the very oldest age groups (appendix). We suggest that governments should therefore minimise mortality in the short term unless vaccine supplies are short of what is required to protect the entire population for 1 year or more. Such calculations should be expanded to include other statistics, such as years of disability-adjusted life-years gained and impacts related to minimising symptoms of long COVID-19,13 influenced by vaccinating different age groups.

An additional complexity in evaluating these options is the extra burden imposed by COVID-19 on health provision for patients who need urgent treatment for other conditions such as cancer, which have implications for net mortality. COVID-19 has had a negative impact on survival rates for cancer due to the reduced provision of services for patients during the pandemic. Modelling estimates suggest there could be 6270 excess deaths in cancer patients over 1 year of the COVID-19 epidemic in the UK and 33 890 such deaths in the USA.[14] More encouragingly, analysis of more than 21 000 hospital admissions of patients with COVID-19 showed that, between March and June 2020, in the UK, death rates in intensive care had halved from 41% to 21%.[15]

How much vaccine is required by any given country year by year to create herd immunity to block SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and how long this will take requires calculations with clearly defined assumptions. Vaccine delivery will probably scale up only gradually as manufacturing capabilities develop over 12-24 months post licensure of a COVID-19 vaccine. As such, the impact of vaccination on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 will start slowly and build up over a few years to reach target coverage levels. The amount of vaccine required for a defined population will depend on evidence from phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trials on efficacy and what can be assumed about the average duration of vaccine protection -- it will be an assumption until the findings of phase 4 trials on duration of both protection against infection and severe disease are reported. For a vaccine with 100% efficacy that gives life-long protection, the level of herd immunity as a proportion of the population, pc, required to block transmission is [1-1/R0], where R0 is the basic reproduction number.[16] Given an R0 value before lockdowns in most countries of between 2.5 to 3.5, we estimate the herd immunity required is about 60-72%. If the proportional vaccine efficacy, E, is considered, the simple expression for pc becomes [1-1/R0/E. If we assume E is 0.8 (80%), then the herd immunity required becomes 75-90% for the defined range of R0 values. For lower efficacies, the entire population would have to be immunised. These overall estimates ignore heterogeneities that can make these figures lower or higher in specific locations.[17, 18]

These calculations become more complicated if we assume immunity is short lived.[19] Calculations of the proportion of the population that will need to be immunised year by year with a COVID-19 vaccine of defined properties can be derived from transmission models of SARS-CoV-2 (appendix). The simple equation for coverage pc becomes a more complicated expression that involves the rate at which people are immunised, E, the magnitude of R0, and the average duration of protection provided by the vaccine (figure). The surface plotted in the figure shows the percentage of the population in year 1 that must be vaccinated and a similar plot of the percentage that must be vaccinated once the system equilibrates after a few years. A rough idea of this time is given by numerical evaluations of the model and gives equilibration by the end of year 2 (appendix). The percentage of the population that must be vaccinated in year 1 is much larger than the percentage that must be vaccinated once the system has stabilised after a few years since most of the population will be susceptible as mass immunisation starts, but after a few years, hopefully, a high proportion will be immunised such that effective herd immunity is created. What is clear from our estimates based on the assumptions that efficacy is satisfactory (greater than 80%) but duration of protection is short (1-2 years), is that a large proportion of the total population would need to be vaccinated if there is to be any chance of getting herd immunity to block the continued transmission of SARS-CoV-2. If the vaccine is protective over a longer duration than natural infection, then our estimates will be too pessimistic.

Figure: Impact of vaccine efficacy and duration of protection on what percentage of the population must be vaccinated in the 1st year (A) and when the system approaches equilibrium in 2-3 years under continued vaccination (B).

What the duration of immunity is for a given COVID-19 vaccine will only be resolved once community-wide vaccination programmes progress. Phase 3 trials will tell us about efficacy and safety, but well designed phase 4 trials are essential based on representative and large numbers of those vaccinated and follow up over time. These studies will record any serious adverse events and identify whether repeatedly exposed individuals acquire coronavirus infections, particularly SARS-CoV-2, and if they do, what is the severity of disease. These cohort-based longitudinal studies will need careful planning and sustained funding, probably from governments with industry contributing. These studies should be targeted at those vaccinated in high-risk groups, such as the individuals older than 70 years and those with comorbidities that predispose to severe disease. Since repeated vaccination of individuals as they age is likely to be required for SARS-CoV-2 control, the pharmaceutical industry should focus on improving the efficacy of the initially licensed COVID-19 vaccines over the coming years.

What happens if countries do not reach high vaccine coverage levels? First, SARS-CoV-2 will become endemic but at a low level, the precise level depending on the degree of vaccine uptake, with peaks in winter and troughs in summer in the northern hemisphere.[20]
Second, policy makers will have to consider whether to mandate vaccination and to create a certificate to record immunisation for school, college, or university, and the workplace. Given vaccine hesitancy, the creation of herd immunity by vaccination is likely to be challenging in many countries. A further problematic issue for policy makers and vaccine producers is to carefully track the molecular evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Vaccine efficacy will depend on a stable virus target, unless we move to a situation such as that for influenza A vaccination where vaccine composition varies depending on which strains are predicted to be dominant in any given year. Research shows continued viral evolution of SARS-CoV-2[21] and this aspect needs to be tracked carefully. Taking novel vaccines successfully through phase 1 to phase 3 trials within a year has been an outstanding achievement, but equally challenging over the coming year will be persuading governments and populations to use COVID-19 vaccines effectively to create herd immunity to protect all.

[This article is a well thought out commentary on the complexities of expectations of vaccination programs aimed at interrupting transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. Not the least being the prioritization of who should be vaccinated in what order, related to what outcomes are desired. The authors at the end touch on a pressing topic that will be critical for vaccination policies "...to carefully track the molecular evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Vaccine efficacy will depend on a stable virus target, unless we move to a situation such as that for influenza A vaccination where vaccine composition varies depending on which strains are predicted to be dominant in any given year. Research shows continued viral evolution of SARS-CoV-2 [21] and this aspect needs to be tracked carefully."

A potentially significant event ongoing at this time is the identification of a mutated virus in one cluster (cluster 5 in mink farms in northern Denmark that showed "a decreased in vitro neutralization when exposed to convalescent sera." (see COVID-19 update (473): animal, Denmark, mink, mutation, eradication, RFI 20201105.7918210 and COVID-19 update (471): animal, Denmark, mink, zoonotic, eradication 20201104.7916300). There are currently more questions than answers related to the significance of this mutated strain and the Danish government is isolating the region with intention of interrupting transmission of this strain. - Mod.MPP]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 218.

Data by country, area, or territory for 5 Nov 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesNov5_1604609836.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 26.2% of daily case numbers and 28.2% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 21.0 million cases. The USA maintains its dominance, followed by Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Canada, and Peru. Ecuador reported more than 1000 new cases in the past 24 hours.

- The European region reported 54.7% of daily case numbers and 52.8% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 12.1 million. Countries not reporting cases today (5 Nov 2020) include Israel, Kazakhstan, Sweden, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. France is dominant, followed by Italy, UK, Spain, Poland, Germany, Russia, Czech Republic, Switzerland, Ukraine, Romania, Netherlands, Portugal, Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary, Slovakia, Greece, Croatia, Armenia, Serbia, Georgia, Turkey, and Slovenia. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours include Azerbaijan, North Macedonia, and the Republic of Moldova.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 6.1% of daily case numbers and 7.9% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 3.20 million cases. Iran is dominant with (record-breaking highs), followed by Morocco, Jordan, Iraq, Lebanon, Pakistan, Tunisia, and UAE. Libya, Kuwait, and the Palestinian Authority each reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000, while Somalia and Yemen have not reported any cases in the past 72 hours.

- The African region reported 1.0% of daily case numbers and 0.86% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.3 million cases. South Africa is dominant, followed by Kenya, Ghana, Ethiopia, Uganda, Angola, Nigeria, Reunion, Guinea, and Cabo Verde.

- The Western Pacific region reported 0.67% of daily case numbers and 0.75% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.75 million cases. Malaysia has taken over dominance, followed by the Philippines, Japan, French Polynesia, South Korea, Guam, and China.

- The South East Asia region reported 11.3% of the daily newly reported cases and 9.5% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 9.4 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.

Impression: The Americas region combined with the European region account for 80% of daily reported cases and 81% of the global reported deaths in the past 24 hours. That being said, Brazil has markedly declined in numbers of daily new cases, whereas the European region has 27 countries reporting more than 1000 cases per day and an additional 7 countries reporting more than 500 cases in the past 24 hours. Cases have somewhat declined in the South East Asian region, while overall case numbers are under 4000 from the Western Pacific region, where Malaysia has overtaken the Philippines as the dominant country and just over 5000 in the Africa region.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (118 167), France (58 046), India (47 622), and Italy (34 502) have been dominant. A global total of 8657 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (4-5 Nov 2020). The global total is now above 49.0 million cases and crossed the 49 million mark over the last 24 hours, having crossed the 48 million mark the previous 24 hours.

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (13 countries) include the USA, India, France, Italy, Poland (27 143), UK (24 138), Brazil (23 317), Germany (21 757), Russia (19 404), Belgium (14 903), Czech Republic (13 229), Argentina (11 100), and Switzerland (10 128). A total of 56 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 30 of the 56 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, and 3 are from the Africa region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 11.0%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 24.6%. Looking at the same comparisons in the USA as the dominant country worldwide with clearly uncontrolled transmission, the 7 day change in daily reported cases is 28.2% and in reported deaths is 16.9%. Similarly in Iran, the dominant country in the Eastern Mediterranean region, the 7 day change in reported cases is 25.6% and in reported deaths is 14.6%.

Impression: Global daily reported cases continue to increase where the daily increase is approaching 600 000 new cases and with countries in the European region and the Americas region showing the largest increases in daily new cases counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. The Africa region has several countries with increased reporting as well. All in all, the growth in the USA is exponential. - Mod.MPP]
