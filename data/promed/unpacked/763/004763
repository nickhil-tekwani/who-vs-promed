Sick animals chase horses, attack broomsticks
---------------------------------------------
Skunks that should be hunkering down to hibernate in southern
Manitoba are instead braving low temperatures to hound horses, attack
inanimate objects and charge at people. A rabies outbreak has hit
Brandon, prompting police in Manitoba's 2nd largest city to issue a
rare warning this week to beware bizarrely behaving skunks.
"On New Year's Eve when we came home, there was a skunk chasing the
horses in the pasture," recalled Barb Vinthers, who has an acreage at
the city's outskirts and a horse farm as a neighbor. "We've been here
35 years," she added, "I've never seen a rabid skunk. I don't want to
see another one. They're very aggressive."
Since mid-December [2007], 2 cases of rabid skunks have been
confirmed -- either by testing or by observing aggressive behavior --
in that area of the city. Traps have been set, as officials
expect more. A total of 3 horses are now under 60-day quarantine in
case they have been exposed to the virus from skunks nipping at their
hooves. Officials are warning people to keep their pets under
control, indoors and vaccinated against the almost-always fatal disease.
On New Year's Day, Brandon animal control officer Kelly Pettinger
responded to Ms. Vinthers's complaint of a cantankerous skunk and
found himself under assault.
"It was biting a lady's broom, attacking it leaning up against the
house," he recalled. He followed it for a few houses, attempting to
capture it, but the animal turned and ran toward him. "I shot it," he said.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency usually counts hundreds of cases
a year of rabies in animals, normally in skunks, bats and raccoons,
but the virus has also been found in domestic animals. In recent
years, Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba and Saskatchewan accounted for the
bulk of animal infections; the virus has rarely surfaced in Atlantic Canada.
"It's something that we kind of live with here in Canada," said Lynn
Bates, a veterinary program officer with the CFIA. "But it's not
often we would get skunks within the city limits."
The viral infection, which is carried by warm-blooded animals,
attacks the central nervous system and the brain. Infected animals
can display symptoms including aggression, depression and paralysis,
which can lead to drooling, as well as odd behavior such as wild
animals that shed their fear of humans, or pets being scared of their
owners. The virus is transmitted through the saliva of an infected
animal, usually by a bite or scratch; it can also be passed on by a
lick to a cut or contact with mucous membranes.
In people, symptoms can develop quickly -- usually within 20 days to
2 months -- or take several years to emerge. Infected people
experience flu-like symptoms first, but the virus can quickly
progress to cause anxiety, confusion, insomnia, hallucinations, a
fear of water, difficulty swallowing and convulsions before the
victim slips into a coma. While human cases of rabies are rare in
Canada, 24 people have died of the disease since record keeping began in 1925.
Last year [2007], a 73-year-old Alberta man died after being bitten
by a rabid bat many months before and failing to seek treatment
before symptoms developed. The most recent victims before him
included 2 people also infected by bat bites, a 52-year-old British
Columbia man in 2003 and a 9-year-old Quebec boy in 2000.
Ms. Vinthers has been phoning neighbors to alert them that the skunk
problem that plagued the area all summer has now turned dangerous
with confirmed cases of rabies. She's also trying to stay inside and
she watches where she's walking.
"Checking the garage before you get out of the car," she said. "When
you drive in, you make sure that you look around to make sure there's
no skunks lingering around the corner."

[Skunks usually migrate and are especially active in the late summer,
early autumn (often around August/September in the Northern
Hemisphere), so finding the skunks out at this time of year is unusual.
The number of cases represented here and the incidents reported should
cause every animal owner of every species to make sure the rabies
vaccinations are up to date. Yes, horses and cattle should be
vaccinated.
The form of rabies described here would likely be the furious form
rabies. The owners of the horses need to watch them for unusual signs,
in case the skunk did bite one of them.
Rabies is a serious disease and skunks out at this time of year with
this kind of bizarre behaviour is certainly reason for concern. It is
also interesting to note, these cases are in the urban, not the rural
areas. - Mod.TG
