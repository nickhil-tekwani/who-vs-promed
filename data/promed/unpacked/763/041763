The Missouri Department of Public Health (DPH) has confirmed a
resident of that state contracted the mosquito-borne virus eastern
equine encephalitis [EEE] in Raynham this summer [of 2011]. "The CDC
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) has confirmed a
(Missouri) person did contract EEE while in Massachusetts," said
Jacqueline Lapine, spokeswoman for the Missouri DPH.

Last month the Massachusetts DPH sent out a notice of a suspected 2nd
case of EEE originating in Raynham. The victim, an elderly Missouri
woman, had spent a significant amount of time visiting in Raynham,
before returning to her home state in late August [2011] where she
developed symptoms of the virus [infection]. Lapine said the victim
was still alive and recovering.

Upon hearing of a 2nd case confirmed in his town, Raynham Selectman
Joseph Pacheco said, "This continues to highlight the need for aerial
spraying early in the season." Pacheco said he will lobby hard through
the winter to get state officials on board to authorized an aerial
spray to prevent further deaths from EEE next year.

A Raynham resident and civic leader died at age 80 from EEE [virus
infection] on 5 Sep [2011] [see ProMED-mail archive no. 20110904.2701]

[In the USA, EEE virus is endemic in states along the east coast,
along the Gulf of Mexico, and the upper Midwest. This year (2011)
there have been cases, mainly equine, in the states of New York,
Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida (where year-round transmission may
occur). No mention is made of neurological sequelae in the elderly
woman reported above.

Moderator TG provides a description of the disease (see ProMED-mail
archive no.20110904.2701), stating "EEE is one of the most severe
mosquito-transmitted diseases in the United States, with approximately
33 percent mortality and significant brain damage in most survivors.
There is no specific treatment for EEE; care is based on symptoms."
Since human cases are sporadic in any given local, the area spraying
of insecticides should be done with caution, as beneficial insects and
other invertebrates may be affected. Prevention of mosquito bites is
prudent in EEE virus endemic areas to avoid transmission to humans.
Vaccination of equine animals should be done routinely in EEE virus
endemic areas.
