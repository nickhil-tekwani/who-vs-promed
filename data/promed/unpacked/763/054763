Citrus Canker Worries Florida Farmers
---------------------------------------
ARCADIA, Fla. (AP) -- Citrus canker has been found above south Florida,
worrying growers who thought the fruit-damaging disease had been confined
to that area.
"We see the disease moving northward and moving into the citrus-growing
regions of the state. We thought we had it isolated but obviously we
don't," said Casey W. Pace, ... of Florida Citrus Mutual, a growers'
association.
The canker was detected in a 200-acre commercial grove of Valencia oranges
east of Arcadia, about 65 miles south of St. Petersburg. Numerous trees
within the grove were infected. The canker most likely arrived by workers
or equipment that hadn't been properly decontaminated, said Terence
McElroy, a spokesman for the state Department of Agriculture.
The outbreak is ... of concern since the growing season begins in about a
month and lasts through June. The disease blemishes fruit and leaves and
causes citrus to fall prematurely. It does not harm people, but ... state
[authorities are eradicating infected trees because the state's $8 billion
citrus industry is threatened.
Growers and agriculture officials have been battling the canker in [8
south Florida counties for several years. Almost 2 million trees have been
destroyed.

[Citrus canker is a bacterial disease caused primarily by _Xanthomonas
axonopodis_ pv. _citri_ and to some extent by _X. axonopodis pv.
aurantifolii_. They infect numerous species, cultivars, and hybrids of
citrus and citrus relatives including orange, grapefruit, pummelo,
mandarin, lemon, lime, tangerine, tangelo, sour orange, rough lemon,
calamondin, trifoliate orange, and kumquat. The battle against citrus
canker, which is predicated on eradication of the pathogen and the disease,
is extremely frustrating and has become a political issue in the state.
In correspondence with Dean Gabriel (Department of Plant Pathology,
University of Florida, Gainesville), I raised the question as to whether
intrusion of the pathogen above the Palm Beach County line represented the
thin edge of the wedge which could lead to further northward intrusion of
the disease in the state. In reply, he asked if it was the thin edge or the
tip of the iceberg that is about to be revealed. Several factors are
operative, including latent infections, incomplete assessment of leaves at
tops of citrus trees and injunctions against the State of Florida to
prevent removal of infected trees. Gabriel stressed that weather conditions
are also a major factor, especially hurricanes or strong storms that
facilitate widespread infection of citrus plants. Fresh market grapefruit
growers are the major production group at risk if further northward
intrusion of the pathogen continues.
To date, about 590 000 citrus trees in residential areas and 1.3 million
trees in groves have been destroyed in Florida.
