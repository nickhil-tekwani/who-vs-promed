MENINGOCOCCAL VACCINE NEED: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
===================================================
Date: Mon, 3 Mar 1997 16:25:12 -0500
From: Roger A. Miller <miller.21@osu.edu>
Several recent bulletins have been published about Saudi Arabian restrictions
for travel during the season of the Islamic Hajj. Exactly when does this
event occur? I have not been able to track this information down. I
understand that meningococcal vaccine recommendations for several countries
in the Middle East and Indian subcontinent are only worrisome in the months
surrounding this event. Is this correct?

[A "hajj" is a pilgrimage to Mecca (Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of
Muhammad), a religious duty for Muslims. The month of Ramadan, the ninth of
the Islamic year, is observed as sacred, with fasting and celebrations.
During Ramadan many Muslims go to Mecca. As one might imagine, having many
people gather from far-flung places is asking for epidemiological problems.
Many studies of disease outbreaks associated with such gatherings have been
made. If one of our knowledgeable readers would care to comment on this,
with specific regard to meningococcal infections and the need for
meningococcal vaccines when traveling to Saudi Arabia during and after
Ramadan, please send a message to ProMED-mail. Thanks. -- Mod CHC]
