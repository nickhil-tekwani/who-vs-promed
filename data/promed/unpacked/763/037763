Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1 (32049060046): São Mateus, Espírito Santo
Date of start of the outbreak: 25 Apr 2018

Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Equidae / 3 / 1 / 0 / 1 / -
Affected population: an adult equine showing motion incoordination and lateral decubitus has been euthanized for the purposes of sampling. The other animals of the property did not show clinical signs.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Equidae/ 33 / 0 / 0 / 33
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: vectors
Epidemiological comments
The official veterinary services are investigating notifications of mortality in equines associated with neurological signs in the north east region of the state of Espírito Santo. Initially, the samples have been tested in order to detect rabies in herbivores. Because of negative results, the samples were sent to the Evandro Chagas Institute, reference national laboratory of the Ministry of Health, to investigate arbovirosis. Complementary laboratory and epidemiological investigations are on-going, in collaboration with the national and local human health services, as well as alert communication actions to report suspicious cases.

Control measures
Measures applied: surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Evandro Chagas Institute (national laboratory) / Equidae / real-time reverse transcriptase / polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 4 Jun 2018 / Positive
Animal virology laboratory, Minas Gerais Federal University (regional laboratory) / Equidae / nested RT- PCR) / 4 Jun 2018 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["West Nile fever is a mosquitoborne viral disease that can affect birds, humans, and horses causing inapparent infection, mild febrile illness, meningitis, encephalitis, or death. West Nile virus (WNV) is a member of the genus _Flavivirus_ in the family Flaviviridae. The arbovirus is maintained in nature by cycling through birds and mosquitoes; numerous avian and mosquito species support virus replication. For many avian species WNV infection causes no overt signs while other birds, such as American crows (_Corvus brachyrhynchos_) and blue jays (_Cyanocitta cristata_), often succumb to fatal systemic illness. Among mammals, clinical disease is primarily exhibited in horses and humans.

"Clinical signs of WNV infection in horses arise from viral-induced encephalitis or encephalomyelitis. Infections are dependent on mosquito transmission and are seasonal in temperate climates, peaking in the early autumn in the northern hemisphere. Affected horses frequently demonstrate mild to severe ataxia. Signs can range from slight incoordination to recumbency. Some horses exhibit weakness, muscle fasciculation, and cranial nerve deficits. Fever is not a consistently recognised feature of the disease in horses.

"WNV has a wide geographical range that includes parts of Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia (Kunjin virus), and in North, Central, and South America. Migratory birds are thought to be primarily responsible for virus dispersal, including reintroduction of WNV from endemic areas into regions that experience sporadic outbreaks. WNV is maintained in a mosquito-bird-mosquito transmission cycle, whereas humans and horses are considered dead end hosts."
