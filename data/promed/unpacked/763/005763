Turkish Cypriot authorities said on Monday [30 Jan 2006] they were
worried an outbreak of avian flu among poultry could hit badly needed
tourism revenues and said they were stepping up efforts to prevent
the virus spreading.
The European Commission confirmed on Sunday the presence of the
deadly H5N1 strain of avian flu in a sample taken from poultry in
northern Cyprus.
Turkey, just to the north of Cyprus, has reported 21 human cases of
H5N1 since the start of 2006, including 4 deaths. Turkey has culled
about 1.5 million poultry to stem the disease.
"We are worried. It (bird flu) could have an effect, not just on the
north, but on the whole of the island," the head of Turkish Cypriot
hoteliers, Turan Beydagli, told Reuters.
Cyprus is divided into a prosperous, internationally recognised Greek
Cypriot south and a smaller, poorer Turkish Cypriot north which is
recognised only by Turkey. Despite continued international trade
restrictions, the north's economy has grown strongly in the past few
years, propelled mainly by tourism, construction and real estate.
Official figures show gross domestic product (GDP) in the
self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) leapt 31
percent in 2004 to 7350 USD per head -- still small compared to the
Greek Cypriots' 21 000 USD but a big jump from a low base.
Economy and Tourism Minister Dervis Deniz said it was too early to
say if the bird flu would harm economic growth.
"So far we have not seen an effect... on the economy as a whole. It
is only the 4 or 5 big commercial chicken farms that are losing out,
and that is purely because Turkish Cypriots are not buying chicken or
eggs as much as before," he said. "North Cyprus does not export
chicken, so a newly imposed ban on imports of poultry into the EU
from north Cyprus will not have an impact."
Health Minister Esref Vaiz said the situation in the enclave was
under control and that a surveillance zone around the infected
village of Incirli had been widened to 10 km (6 miles) from 3 km.
Authorities have already culled poultry in the infected area.
"We are checking all the surrounding villages to make sure all
domestic birds are confined so they cannot come into contact with
wildfowl," he said.
The Greek Cypriot government has said it has no plans to close any
crossing points to the north.
Nevruz Kavazlar, a housewife living in the infected North Cypriot
village, said: "There is no panic. We are sad that it turned up here,
but we are glad that it was discovered. But one thing has changed. We
used to be woken up by the neighbours' cockerel, but now we oversleep."

A 15-year-old girl has died of the bird flu in Iraq, health officials
there and abroad said today, a finding that indicates that the virus
has arrived in yet another country -- one whose ability to control
contagion is likely to be hampered by war.
The confirmation of the cause of the girl's death also suggests,
officials said, that the disease may be spreading widely -- and
undetected -- among birds in the countries of central Asia, which are
poorly equipped to identify and report infections. Avian flu has
never been reported in birds in Iraq.
As happened in Turkey earlier [in January 2006], the spread of the
H5N1 strain of bird flu to a new part of the world became evident
only through a human death. That is notable, and alarming to health
officials, because bird flu rarely infects humans, and usually does
so late in the course of an animal outbreak, after close contact with
sick birds.
"We shouldn't be seeing human cases first, and this points to serious
gaps in surveillance," a spokeswoman for the World Health
Organization, Maria Cheng, said in Geneva. "But given the situation
in Turkey, I don't think we'd be surprised to see isolated humans
cases in surrounding areas."
The girl died this month in Sulaimaniyah, in the Kurdish region in
northern Iraq, 3 days after touching a dead bird infected with the
virus, the Iraqi health minister said today. The girl's uncle, who
died last week, is also presumed to have succumbed to the disease,
although test results are pending.
A serious bird flu outbreak has killed 4 people and hundreds of
thousands of birds in the Kurdish part of neighboring Turkey over the
past 6 weeks. Trade routes, traveled by truck and mules, crisscross
national borders in a large ethnic Kurdish area, which includes
portions of several countries.
Officials at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization
[FAO] in Rome warned last week that bird flu had probably already
spread from Turkey into neighboring countries -- and specifically
warned Iran, Iraq, Syria and Armenia to be on high alert. But until
today, there was no hard evidence of such movement.
"We encouraged the countries to increase surveillance," said Juan
Lubroth, a senior veterinarian at the FAO in Rome. "But I'm not a
policeman. What I can do is to ask governments to be more vigilant."
Mr. Lubroth, who is studying the spread of avian influenza, said that
monitoring to detect the disease in animals was weak in much of the
region and that governments needed to be more transparent -- both in
acknowledging outbreaks and in admitting when they lacked the
capacity or money to detect the disease, which requires complicated
laboratory testing.
For example, Dr. Rod Kennard, who is managing a year-old United
Nations project to rebuild veterinary services in Iraq, said that the
local government in Sulaimaniyah was monitoring commercial poultry
flocks, "but they don't really have the ability to monitor what's
going on in village flocks."
He said that "it is a really big question" whether a country in the
throes of armed conflict could coordinate a response to a complicated
problem like bird flu, although he noted that northern provinces were
generally "not as troubled" as some of the areas in Central Iraq.
Kurdish authorities quarantined 4 villages today because of suspicion
that birds in the area, and possibly people, might be infected. They
said that 150 teams had moved through the areas destroying birds.
To contain bird flu outbreaks, sick birds must be rapidly identified
and culled, along with any poultry in a surrounding safety zone. A
slow start in Turkey allowed the disease to spread throughout the
country, and the government is now struggling to contain 55 outbreaks
in 15 provinces.
The Iraqi health minister, Dr. Abdul Mutaleb Mohamed Ali, appealed
for help, noting that 2 other people in distant parts of Iraq had
also been tested for bird flu. "We ask the international community to
move fast and send our country technical assistance and health
equipment," he said today.
Over the past few months, there have been occasional reports of
large-scale bird deaths in both Iran and northern Iraq, places that
veterinary officials had tagged as high risk because they are on bird
migration routes. But H5N1 was never implicated.
In October 2005, there were large-scale deaths on commercial farms in
northern Iraq, Dr. Kennard said. Birds were tested and "we were told
it was negative," he said, "but we're not entirely sure how reliable that is."
In most countries with serious bird flu outbreaks, including Turkey,
the military has provided the manpower required to contain them,
going door-to-door to find chickens to cull. That is not an option in Iraq.
Also, much of the trade in the region is informal and unregulated, so
border control of animals is difficult.

H5N1 has, so far, been confirmed in the following Near-Eastern
countries: Turkey, Cyprus (north), Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. In
the latter 2, the virus was identified in captive birds.
2 other avian diseases, clinically very similar to H5N1, are endemic
in the region: Newcastle disease and avian influenza caused by the
LPAI serotype H9N2. Differential diagnosis of the 3 disease entities
can be achieved only by laboratory investigations.- Mod.AS]
[When dealing with zoonotic diseases with simultaneous outbreaks in
humans and animals, there are frequently reports that ProMED-mail
posts that contain information on both the human and animal
outbreaks. While we at ProMED-mail usually try to 'clearly' separate
the outbreaks into human health threads and animal health threads,
sometimes that line of distinction is difficult to make. In the
above article on the situation in Iraq [2], the information on the
human cases has already been covered in postings on the human health
thread of the avian influenza outbreak. The rationale for placing
this article in the animal health thread is the focus and discussion
on the observation that human cases have been confirmed in areas
where animal cases have not been confirmed, albeit are strongly
suspected (animal cases). To date, the overwhelming epidemiologic
evidence (and viral genetic evidence) has been that the human cases
of avian influenza have been associated with close contact with
diseased avians. Hence, the confirmation of human cases in Iraq,
combined with anecdotal evidence of avian die offs in the surrounding
area begs the issue that there are avian outbreaks in the area, and
there remains the need for improved surveillance in the animal health
sector. - Mod.MPP]
