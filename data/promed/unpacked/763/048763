Disneyland Paris accidentally poisoned 22 guests and staff in its swimming pool with harmful chemicals. People affected suffered sickness, coughing, chest pain and headaches after breathing in the fumes,

It's reported the chemicals were mixed incorrectly, causing chlorine gas to be released.

When chlorine gas is breathed in, it can cause swelling of the upper airway, coughing, sickness, chest pain and headaches.

Emergency services were called, and 4 of the 22 people affected were sent to hospital.

Many guests at the hotel were put up in different rooms away from the swimming pool, and the pool was shut down.

The pool was still shut yesterday [20 Aug 2018] after the incident.

[Normally, chlorine is used as part of the sanitation for public swimming pools. It sounds as if too much chlorine was added to the pool and produced chlorine gas.

Chlorine gas is a pulmonary irritant with a strong smell of bleach. Most pool chemicals are usually granular, and a specified amount is added to the pool, or can be mixed in a bucket and then added to the pool.

If chlorine gas is released into the air, people may be exposed through skin or eye contact. They also may be exposed by breathing air containing chlorine. If chlorine gas was produced, it usually settles into lower areas, so more than the pool may need to be cordoned off for a short while.

During or immediately after exposure to dangerous concentrations of chlorine, the following signs and symptoms may develop:
- Blurred vision
- Burning pain, redness, and blisters on the skin if exposed to gas. Skin injuries similar to frostbite can occur if skin is exposed to liquid chlorine
- Burning sensation in the nose, throat, and eyes
- Coughing
- Chest tightness
- Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. These may appear immediately if high concentrations of chlorine gas are inhaled, or they may be delayed if low concentrations of chlorine gas are inhaled.
- Fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) that may be delayed for a few hours
- Nausea and vomiting
- Watery eyes
- Wheezing
- Showing these signs or symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to chlorine https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/chlorine/basics/facts.asp.

However, some of these symptoms may require immediate medical attention. Most should resolve when access to fresh air is provided.

If the concentration was quite high, then immediate washing of the clothes and the body may also help alleviate the some of the clinical signs as well as sources for any possible re-exposure or source of continuing exposure.

We hope all affected individuals are recovering. - Mod.TG
