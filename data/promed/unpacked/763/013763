Possibility of West Nile virus and St. Louis encephalitis
transmission post hurricane Katrina
-----------------------------------------------
"It's possible you could have a significant outbreak of West Nile," a
virus that can be dangerous or fatal to the elderly and the
immune-compromised, said Anthony S. Fauci, Director of the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. But we won't likely
know for weeks. Robert Edelman, professor of medicine and pediatrics,
University of Maryland School of Medicine, recalled that when
hurricane Camille barreled into the eastern United States in 1969,
heavy rains and the storm surge wiped out mosquitoes for about a
month. Katrina is expected to have a similar effect.
Once the mosquitoes' breeding cycle is restored, and eggs begin to
hatch in standing water, residents in the Gulf area could be at
greater risk for both West Nile and St. Louis encephalitis (SLE),
another mosquito-borne illness. Widespread spraying of the area might
curtail an outbreak. Whether toxic chemicals and oil in the water
might hamper mosquito breeding is not known. Neither West Nile nor
St. Louis encephalitis is passed from person to person.

[The above comprises the last 2 paragraphs of a report entitled "Next
Threat: Illness," which discusses several health aspects resulting
from hurricane Katrina.
I agree that flooding has probably flushed out mosquito larval
habitats, and it is only when water recedes that smaller and discrete
water bodies will be formed that are likely to be more attractive to
mosquito breeding. Along the Gulf coast, the primary vectors of SLE
are _Culex pipiens_ and _Culex quinquefasciatus_, mosquitoes that
often breed in waters that are contaminated with feces or other
organic matter, habitats which could become plentiful. Vectors of
West Nile virus comprise several mosquito species, including the _Cx.
pipiens_ complex.
Widespread insecticidal spraying is a possible course of action. This
could involve larviciding aquatic waters suspected, or better still
known, to be larval breeding places, or adulticiding. Both can be
done from ground-based equipment (or boats) or by aerial
applications. Depending on where adult mosquitoes are resting,
thermal fogs or aerosols can be directed at out of door resting
places, such as at vegetation, or indoors (houses and other
buildings) where one might find adult females of the _Cx. pipiens_
complex. To spray or not to spray can be a difficult question. It is
likely to be costly, and the effects of it may be inconclusive.
I wonder what effect the hurricane has had on the local bird
populations, remembering that passeriformes and columbiformes are
reservoir hosts of SLE, while corvids are reservoir hosts for West
Nile virus. - Mod.MS]
