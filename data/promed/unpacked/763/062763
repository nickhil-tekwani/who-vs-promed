The study referred to in the first ProMED post [ref. above concerning
xenotransplants does not reassure me in the least. I do however see that the
3 major public health problems involving xenotransplants are still at risk
of being drowned in the euphoria of
the moment.
1. The main risk of xenotransplants is not to the relatively few transplant
patients, but to the entire human species. No matter how small the number of
transplants being allowed by the FDA at the moment, it only takes one
transplant patient to be able to transmit a virus to another human being,
and from there to others in the population. How can this be avoided? Do we
isolate them for life?
As for the comment
>.....since not everyone is an organ donor, but every life is precious,
maybe this is the solution to saving those we love. The world is not
perfect.<
try telling that to public health officials in the Third World and to those
who have lost friends and relatives to the AIDS epidemic.
2. The keyword in the discussion is "UNKNOWN". The known viruses are not a
problem when compared to "UNKNOWN" viruses. It never ceases to amaze me how
officials rely on the erroneous assumption that you can "WATCH" a
xenotransplant in
order to PREVENT a catastrophe. The only thing you can watch are the
CONSEQUENCES of an unknown viral infection. How can you prevent the
consequences of a virus you know nothing about?
In order to diagnose a viral infection, you need antigens of or antibodies
directed against the virus. With an UNKNOWN virus, you have neither. Find a
universal viral antigen and you may have something (but then, how can you
know it actually IS universal?).
And what will you do to the transplant patient and their close contacts
(i.e. the family) if there IS transmission of a pathogenic virus?
3. The problem researchers wish (exclusively) to address is the rejection of
the transplant. Bigger and better immunosuppressant drugs not only mean a
higher PATIENT survival rate, but higher VIRUS survival rate as well.
Until public health take precedence over the almighty dollar and the need to
publish more and more scientific articles, we peons of the general public
will have to suffer the consequences.....or do we?

[Raymond is not completely correct with respect to the need for a universal
antigen. One could design sets pf random primers and look by PCR. That,
however, is still the needle in the haystack story - Mod.CHC
