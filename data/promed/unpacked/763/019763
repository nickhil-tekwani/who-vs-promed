Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ (STEC) [referred to in ProMED-mail
posts as Vero toxin-producing E. coli_ or VTEC - Mod.LL] infection causes
diarrhea that is often bloody and can result in potentially
life-threatening hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) (1). _E. coli_ O157:H7 is
the commonest cause of VTEC infection in the USA, producing 73 000 [cases
of illness] annually, according to the last estimate in 1999 (2).
Unlike O157, however, little is known about the incidence of non-O157
strains. Because STEC other than O157 are not commonly identified, the
incidence, trends, and epidemiology of non-O157 VTEC are not well
understood. To assess trends in Shiga toxin enzyme immunoassay (Stx EIA)
testing by local clinical laboratories, the Connecticut Department of
Public Health (CTDPH) analyzed results of confirmatory testing conducted in
the state laboratory during 2000-2005.
The findings indicated that a total of 403 VTEC infections were reported by
clinical laboratories in Connecticut, including 207 identified as VTEC by
Stx EIA testing alone, and that the use of Stx EIA increased from 2000 to
2005. Use of Stx EIA without prompt culture confirmation can delay or
prevent serotyping and subtyping of isolates and detection of both O157 and
non-O157 VTEC outbreaks. Public health authorities in all states should
ensure that clinical laboratories forward Stx EIA-positive specimens to the
state laboratory for isolation and identification of VTEC, as recommended
by the Association of Public Health Laboratories and CDC (3).
Clinical laboratories typically use sorbitol-MacConkey (SMAC) agar, a
culture method, to identify VTEC O157, which cannot ferment sorbitol and
therefore forms colorless colonies. Like other intestinal flora, most
non-O157 VTEC strains ferment sorbitol and form pink colonies; therefore,
SMAC agar cannot be used to readily differentiate between
sorbitol-fermenting non-O157 STEC strains and other sorbitol-fermenting
intestinal flora growing on the plate. Rapid diagnostic EIAs capable of
detecting Stx in stool specimens or culture broths are commercially
available and used increasingly by clinical laboratories. These nonculture
methods are capable of detecting both O157 and non-O157 VTEC strains;
however, these methods should not be considered as substitutes for culture.
Clinical laboratories in Connecticut have been required to report
culture-confirmed VTEC O157 infections to state public health officials
since 1992 and Stx EIA-positive infections since 2000 (4).
During 2000--2005, the number of clinical laboratories in Connecticut
conducting Stx EIA testing increased from 4 (11 per cent) of 35
laboratories to 10 (31 per cent) of 32 laboratories. Because not all Stx
EIA tests at these laboratories are confirmed by culture, clinical
laboratories performing Stx EIA without culture confirmation have been
required to submit the enrichment broth from all Stx-positive stool
specimens to the CTDPH state laboratory since 2000.
At the CTDPH state laboratory, Stx-positive broths are plated on SMAC agar
and SMAC agar enriched with cefixime-tellurite (CT-SMAC). Sorbitol-negative
colonies are screened for the O157 antigen using a latex agglutination test
and, if positive, are tested for the H7 antigen. If the sorbitol-negative
colonies are O157-negative, both sorbitol-positive and sorbitol-negative
colonies are tested for Stx using EIA. In Nov 2002, the CTDPH state
laboratory instituted the additional step of screening Stx-positive
colonies for the 6 commonest non-O157 STEC serogroups in the USA (O26, O45,
O103, O111, O121, and O145), using commercial antisera. All non-O157 VTEC
isolates are forwarded to CDC for further characterization. To allow
examination of the epidemiology of non-O157 STEC, in April 2004, CTDPH also
began interviewing all patients with confirmed VTEC cases using a
standardized questionnaire that collects clinical and exposure information.
During 2000-2005, a total of 403 laboratory-confirmed VTEC infections were
reported in Connecticut. Of these, 196 (49 per cent) were identified as
STEC O157 at clinical laboratories using culture; the remaining 207 (51 per
cent) were identified as VTEC at clinical laboratories using Stx EIA with
no culture confirmation (for table see original URL). The percentage of
VTEC isolates identified initially by Stx EIA testing increased
significantly (p less than 0.001) from 33 per cent in 2000 to 59 per cent
in 2005. Similarly, the percentage of STEC O157 isolates identified as VTEC
initially by Stx EIA testing increased significantly (p less than 0.01)
from 23 per cent in 2000 to 40 per cent in 2005.
Among the Stx EIA-positive broths submitted to the CTDPH state laboratory,
82 (40 per cent) yielded VTEC O157 and 125 (60 per cent) yielded non-O157
STEC. The percentage identified as non-O157 STEC has remained higher than
50 per cent since 2001. Four serogroups accounted for 88 (70 per cent) of
the STEC non-O157 isolates: O103, 26 (21 per cent) isolates; O111, 26 (21
per cent) isolates; O26, 18 (14 per cent) isolates; and O45, 18 (14 per
cent) isolates. The remaining 37 (30 per cent) belonged to 15 other
serogroups. During 2000-2005, the incidence of identified non-O157 VTEC
infections increased 50 per cent, from 0.4 to 0.6 per 100 000 population.
Patients with non-O157 VTEC infection were less likely than those with VTEC
O157 infection to have had bloody diarrhea (56 per cent versus 90 per cent,
p less than 0.001), have been hospitalized (12 per cent versus 45 per cent,
p less than 0.001), have developed HUS (0 versus 9 per cent, p less than
0.001), or have eaten at a restaurant in the 7 days preceding illness onset
(59 per cent versus 88 per cent, p=0.01).
No differences were found in the proportion of patients who had eaten
ground beef, had contact with farm animals, or visited a petting zoo in the
7 days before illness onset.

Editorial note:
Non-O157 VTEC infections represent a substantial portion of
laboratory-confirmed VTEC cases in Connecticut, consistent with findings
from studies in other states (5,6). The number of clinical laboratories in
Connecticut conducting Stx EIA testing has been increasing, thus the
identified increase in the incidence of non-O157 VTEC infections likely is
a reflection of increased Stx EIA testing in the state and subsequent
required submission of Stx-positive broths to the state laboratory for
further characterization. However, because only 31 per cent of clinical
laboratories tested for non-O157 VTEC in 2005, the number of detected cases
likely represents the minimum annual incidence in Connecticut for that year.
Overall, infections caused by non-O157 VTEC were less severe than those
caused by VTEC O157. However, the severity of disease caused by VTEC is
related to the virulence profile of the infecting strain, and some non-O157
serotypes cause illness as severe as that caused by VTEC O157 (7,8).
The sources of non-O157 VTEC infections are not well described, although
outbreak investigations indicate that some sources are similar to those of
VTEC O157 infections (9,10). Furthermore, the similar exposures of patients
with VTEC O157 and non-O157 VTEC cases in Connecticut described in this
report suggest that many of the routes of transmission are similar.
The findings in this report are subject to at least 3 limitations. First,
most clinical laboratories in Connecticut do not conduct Stx EIA testing;
22 (69 per cent) of 32 laboratories use culture methods. As a result, the
true number of non-O157 VTEC infections remains undefined. Second, lack of
uniformity exists among clinical laboratories regarding types of stool
specimens that are cultured for VTEC O157 or tested for Stx. Some
laboratories culture or test all stool specimens, others only bloody
stools, and others only on physician request. Finally, the numbers of each
non-O157 VTEC serogroup were too small to permit serogroup-specific
analysis of disease severity and epidemiology.
In Connecticut, Stx EIA testing increasingly is replacing direct culture
for VTEC O157 in clinical laboratories. Connecticut has taken steps to
ensure that all VTEC isolates are further characterized, which can enable
evaluation of the incidence and epidemiology of non-O157 VTEC. Clinical
laboratories in all states should forward Stx EIA-positive specimens to the
public health laboratory for confirmation and characterization by culture
methods to rule out false-positive EIA results and ensure accurate VTEC
surveillance (3).

[The 1 Nov 2006 issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases includes a paper that
addresses the issue of virulence of STEC, particularly in relationship to
the genotypes of Shiga toxins Stx1 and Stx2: (Bielaszewska M, Friedrich AW,
Aldick T, et al. Shiga toxin activatable by intestinal mucus in
_Escherichia coli_ isolated from humans: Predictor for a severe clinical
outcome. Clin Infect Dis 2006; 43:1160-7) and an editorial (Orth D, Wurzner
R. What makes an enterohemorrhagic _Escherichia coli_? Clin Infect Dis
2006; 43: 1168-9).
As summarized by Orth and Wurzner (the citation numbers are those in the
editorial) [STEC is used in this discussion - Mod.LL]:
"Stxs can be divided into 2 major groups: Stx1 (which is almost identical
to Stx produced by _Shigella dysenteriae_) and Stx2. The Stx1 group
consists of Stx1, Stx1c, and Stx1d. The Stx2 group consists of Stx2, Stx2c,
Stx2d, Stx2dactivatable, Stx2e, and Stx2f (4).
"There is an increasing body of evidence that the stx genotype is
associated with the severity of disease and strongly determines the
likelihood of progression to HUS. Patients infected with EHEC strains that
harbor stx2 as the sole stx gene have been found to develop HUS
significantly more frequently than patients infected with strains harboring
stx1 alone or stx1 in combination with stx2. In addition, stx2c has been
associated with HUS (4).
"Although the presence of stx2 and stx2c is associated with an increased
probability of HUS development, STEC that carry stx2d or stx2e can be
considered to be LP-STEC [LP = low pathogenicity - Mod.LL], irrespective of
the presence of other virulence factors. The former strains have been
associated with non-bloody diarrhea but not with HUS (4, 5); the latter
strains mainly cause edema in pigs, and the rare human isolates originate
from patients with mild diarrhea or from asymptomatic carriers (6).
"In their report, Bielaszewska et al (7) focus on a very interesting Stx:
namely, a type of Stx with cytotoxicity that is activated by human and
mouse intestinal mucus and, therefore, is designated Stx2d-activatable.
"Bielaszewska et al show that the activatable phenotype is regularly
expressed by the clinical isolates that harbor the corresponding gene.
Therefore, the activation of this Stx by human intestinal mucus in vivo
during infection may increase the virulence of such strains."

by intestinal mucus in Escherichia coli isolated from humans: predictor for
a severe clinical outcome. Clin Infect Dis 2006; 43: 1160-7."
Indeed in Bielaszewska's paper, she and her colleagues in Munster, Germany
report that:
"The stx2d-activatable gene was identified in 60 (6.5 per cent) of 922 STEC
strains [not all O157:H7 - Mod.LL]; in 31 of these strains, it was the sole
stx gene. 30 of these 31 strains produced Stx2d-activatable. All of them
lacked the intimin-encoding eae gene. Among eae-negative STEC, which
typically cause mild diarrhea or asymptomatic infection, production of
Stx2d-activatable was significantly associated with the ability to cause
severe disease, including bloody diarrhea (p less than .001), and with
systemic complications, such as hemolytic uremic syndrome (p less than .001)."
This activatable genotype of Stxd appears to be an important marker to
assess risk of serious outcomes. Analysis of the Connecticut strains would
be interesting. - Mod.LL]
