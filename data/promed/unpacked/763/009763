UNDIAGNOSED DISEASES, MANGO - PAKISTAN: (SINDH) UPDATE

Mango crop output may fall 30 percent
-------------------------------------
Pakistan's production of mangoes is likely to post a decline of 30 to
40 percent in 2011, as orchards spread over thousands of acres in the
country's southern province of Sindh have come under different disease
attacks.

The situation was reported to be serious in Hyderabad, Tando
Allahyar, Shaheed Benazirabad, Matiari, Naushero Feroz, Sanghar, and
Umerkot districts, according to a press statement issued by Harvest
Tradings. However, a large area has been cleared to prevent the spread
of disease.

In Sindh, mango is cultivated on around 56 000 hectares [approx. 138
000 acres], with annual production of around 390 000 tonnes.

[Mango (_Mangifera indica_) is one of the most important fruits
worldwide. It can be affected by a large number of diseases, many of
which are due to fungal pathogens. No virus has been reported from
mango so far.

In Pakistan, outbreaks of the fungal diseases quick decline
(_Lasiodiplodia theobromae_) in 2008 (ProMED-mail post no.
20080229.0832), and powdery mildew (_Oidium mangiferae_) in 2007
(ProMED-mail post no. 20070611.1900) have been reported. Other mango
diseases known to occur in Pakistan include anthracnose caused by the
fungi _Glomerella cingulata_ or _Colletotrichum acutatum_ and
considered the most important disease of the crop, as well as leaf and
stem blights, diebacks, and root rots due to a range of different
pathogens.

Undiagnosed diseases were reported from Sindh already in 2009 and
2010 (ProMED-mail posts 20090511.1762 and 20100729.2543), but
identification of the pathogen(s) involved has apparently still not
been achieved. This is surprising for such an important crop since
effective disease control requires first a reliable pathogen
diagnosis. It is possible that a combination of a number of diseases
and external factors may cause the problems.
