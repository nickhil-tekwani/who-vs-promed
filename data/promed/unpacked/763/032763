Tasmanian pigeon racers are on alert after the 1st case of the disease avian paramyxovirus in the state was confirmed in a flock in the north west.

The infected birds came from a flock that is not associated with the Tasmanian Pigeon Racing Federation, which demands all racing pigeons are vaccinated against the virus before they can compete.

An outbreak of the same virus, the 1st in Australia, hit Victoria in 2011.

The virus is mostly species-specific, but 2 birds that were not pigeons caught the disease in Victoria in 2011.

Exercise flights across Bass Strait were stopped to cut the risk of transmitting the virus.

The flights are set to start again next week [1-7 Jul 2013] but Tasmania's chief veterinary officer Rod Andrewartha said more was now known about the virus and vaccinated pigeons could continue to race and be shown.

Moonah Homing Society secretary Barry Jensen said the society's 30 members had all had their birds inoculated but racers would still be keeping a close eye on their flocks.

Mr Jensen said anyone with unvaccinated birds should get their flocks inoculated as soon as possible and discourage "feral" pigeons from entering lofts.

Dr Andrewartha said the pro-active approach taken by the federation meant the local pigeon racing community was in a good position.

He said authorities were working with the affected owner to contain the disease and any recent potential contacts with the infected flock would be followed up.

"We recommend that pigeon owners who have not already vaccinated their birds against avian paramyxovirus 1 (APMV-1) should do so to protect them against this disease," he said. "Phone your racing club or your veterinarian about vaccination. "We also ask that owners of both racing pigeons and show pigeons keep a close eye on their flocks for any signs of sick birds."

Dr Andrewartha said human infection from APMV-1 had not been reported and human infections, such as conjunctivitis, associated with other closely related viruses such as Newcastle disease were rare and had only occurred in those who worked very closely with birds.

[Avian paramyxovirus 1 (APMV-1; Fam. _Paramyxoviridae_) is the etiologic agent of Newcastle disease. APMV-1 strains maintained in pigeon populations have some antigenic differences from other APMV-1 isolates, and are sometimes called pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1), which was first reported in racing pigeons in Italy in 1981, and then became pandemic.

Several Newcastle disease outbreaks in chickens have been attributed to PPMV-1, which makes it a real threat to the poultry industry. However, some PPMV-1 strains cause only minimal disease and have a low intra-cerebral pathogenicity index in chickens. Nevertheless, they do have a virulence potential for chickens, which can emerge upon serial passages in these animals.- Mod.PMB
