Of these, 1926 (39.3%) are currently being followed up, 2923 (58.6%) have completed 21 days follow-up, while 4 (0.1%) were lost to follow up. A total of 80 (1.6%) symptomatic contacts have been identified, of which 49 (1%) have tested positive.
- Multi-sectoral one health national rapid response teams (NCDC, NFELTP [Nigeria Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program], Federal Ministry of Agricultural and Federal Ministry of Environment) deployed to Ondo, Edo, Ebonyi, and Taraba.
- National Lassa fever multi-partner, multi-sectoral emergency operations centre (EOC) continues to coordinate the response activities at all levels.

[The 39 new confirmed and 1374 suspected cases (up from 1249 suspected cases in the previous report) indicate that Lassa fever virus transmission is continuing, as Nigeria is now well within the period of the year when more cases usually occur as illustrated in the graph in Figure 3. There are 93 confirmed deaths, up from 83 in the previous reporting period. Fortunately, no new healthcare workers were infected during this reporting period, and the total infected healthcare workers remains at 15. This outbreak remains widespread so far in 2019, with confirmed cases occurring in 21 states, and the number of affected LGAs remains at 66 LGAs from the previous reporting period.

Transmission of Lassa virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir hosts' excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It would be interesting to know whether the prevalence of Lassa fever virus has been increasing in populations of rodent hosts in areas where human cases are occurring.

The maps and graphs in the report above are interesting and provide a good picture of how the outbreak has progressed over time. - Mod.TY
