The algae bloom known as red tide has killed 1.2 million more fish
along the Texas coast in less than 2 weeks.

The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department reported Monday [31 Oct 2011]
that about 4.2 million fish have died since the red tide outbreak
began in September 2011. The agency on 20 Oct 2011 estimated 3 million
fish had been killed.

State health officials last week [week of 24 Oct 2011] banned, until
further notice, commercial and recreational harvesting of oysters,
clams and mussels due to red tide. Tuesday would have been opening day
for public harvest of oysters through April.

Experts say red tide, often present in the fall, is worse this year
[2011] because of the Texas drought and recent excessive heat. The
algae thrive in warm, salty water.

Red tide can cause respiratory problems in people.

[The heat in Texas and the severe drought have been problematic this
summer (2011). Going to the beach for relief from the heat was an
interesting experience. The waters of the Gulf of Mexico felt more
like stepping into a tub of hot water.
