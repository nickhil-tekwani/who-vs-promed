Suspected Hemorrhagic Fever - Pointe Noire (Congo Brazzaville)
--------------------------------------------------------------
A 20-year old patient was admitted to the International SOS Clinic of
Pointe Noire on Fri 9 Feb 2001 with fever and abdominal pain. He presented
with a 5-day history of fever. A blood smear was positive for malaria 2
days previously, and he was put on an intramuscular arthemeter in a
community health centre.
He has experienced vomiting, watery diarrhea, and strong abdominal pain.
His abdominal wall was soft on palpation. ASP and ultrasonic scan were
unremarkable. ASAT = 28 UI/l, ALAT = 25 UI/l, bilirubin = 26 mg/l. Stool
test was positive for _Ascaris_. BCC showed 14 000 WBC/microliter, 180 000
platelets, hemoglobin = 15 g/dl, Hematocrit = 50 per cent, sedimentation
rate = 9 mm/hr. PT = 79%, Activated cephalin time = 53/37.
On Sun 11 Feb 2001 he developed an erythematous pharyngitis with gingival
bleeding, dry cough, and a maculopapular eruption, disappearing within 12
hours, not followed with squamous eruption. His temperature was normal but
his general condition was deteriorating and opioid analgesics were needed
to relieve the pain.
On Mon 12 Feb 2001 he was transferred to a public hospital. His temperature
reached 38 degrees C, and he had 2 bouts of hematemesis.
A viral hemorrhagic fever is suspected. [A sample of serum was taken for
laboratory analysis on Sat 10 Feb 2001].

[The outcome of laboratory testing is awaited with interest. There are many
candidates in West Central Africa for an etiological agent of the illness
suffered by this unfortunate young man, which can only be discriminated by
laboratory analysis. - Mod.CP]
