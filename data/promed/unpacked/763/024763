re: camel deaths in Saudi Arabia
--------------------------------
I am writing on behalf of Dr Pedro Bezerra, a Brazilian veterinary anatomic
pathologist who is further investigating a neurological disorder in a dairy
cattle herd associated with _Aspergillus clavatus_ mycotoxicosis (see
attached article for more details on this outbreak).

We would like to know if you can suggest any contact person who was
involved with the workup of the toxicosis that killed thousands of camels
in Saudi Arabia last year [2007]. Since reportedly large quantities of _A.
clavatus_ were present in the feed implicated in the death of these
animals, we wonder if the camels may have developed lesions in the central
nervous system in addition to muscle lesions consistent with the
salinomycin toxicosis determined to be the cause of this outbreak. The
former alterations could have contributed to the severity of the disease.

We are aware that evidence of mold growth from foodstuff does not
necessarily mean that the product also contains mycotoxins since the fungus
involved may not be toxigenic. We also know that _A. clavatus_
mycotoxicosis has not yet been reported in camels. Nonetheless, we think it
is possible that neuronal lesions may have been present but gone undetected
as they are localized to specific areas of the brain and spinal cord.
Examination of sections of these tissues of the camels could help Dr
Bezerra to better understand the pathogenesis of _A. clavatus_ mycotoxicosis.

[Dr Bezerra's observation is in agreement with Mod.TG's comment regarding
the Saudi camel intoxication, included in ProMED-mail 20070910.2995: "Many
of the _Aspergillus_ species can produce a variety of mycotoxins. The
article does not tell us the level that was found in the fodder samples.
Neither does it tell us the level of aluminum.

"My strongest impression is that the salinomycin is responsible for the
deaths. However, salinomycin is more often added to grain mixtures than
fodder. And the deaths may be related to a combination of all of these
factors over perhaps a few days to a month."

In view of the importance of mycotoxicosis in farm animals, both from
animal health angle as well as from the potential public health
implications, we find it appropriate to reproduce the following abstract of
the mentioned (2003) paper (this does not imply we suggest _A. clavatus_ as
indeed involved in the Saudi event):

AP Loretti, EM Colodel, D Driemeier, AM Correa, JJ Bangel Jr, L Ferre.
Neurological disorder in dairy cattle associated with consumption of beer
residues contaminated with _Aspergillus clavatus_. J Vet Diagn Invest 2003;
15: 123-32.

"A neurological syndrome in dairy cattle associated with consumption of
moldy beer residues is described. The disease occurred on one farm in late
June 2001, during winter. A total of 6 heifers and one cow out of 45 cattle
were affected during a 3-week period. The affected animals died
spontaneously or were euthanized approximately 2-14 days after the onset of
clinical signs. The clinical signs were characterized by flaccid paralysis
and gait abnormalities. Clinical signs were more pronounced after exercise
and included stiff and unsteady gait, knuckling at the fetlocks of the hind
limbs, frequent falling, inability to rise, muscular tremors, especially of
the head and the hindquarters, and drooling. Main necropsy findings
included degenerative and necrotic changes of the larger medial muscle
groups of the hindquarters, such as, adductor, pectineus, quadriceps
femoris, rectus femoris, sartorius, semimembranosus, semitendinosus, and
vastus medialis, and of the forequarters, including pectoralis descendens,
pectoralis ascendens, and transversus pectoralis. The main histologic
findings consisted of degenerative and necrotic neuronal changes
(chromatolysis) of varying severity and extent affecting selected nuclei of
the brainstem and neurons of the ventral horns of the spinal cord. Similar
microscopic lesions were observed in the neurons of the spinal cord of one
experimental sheep force-fed for 35 days with 1 kg/day of the same batch of
foodstuff that was originally fed to the cattle. Coarse white or gray
lumps, interpreted as mycelia, were observed in the beer by-product.

"_Aspergillus clavatus_ was the dominant fungus isolated. Deaths ceased
after the consumption of beer residue was discontinued. Recovery from
illness was observed in one animal. The diagnosis was based on
epidemiological data, clinical signs, necropsy findings, histological
lesions, dosing trial, and mycology. A similar condition caused by
consumption of barley byproducts, sprouted wheat, corn sprouts, and
beetroot screenings contaminated with _A. clavatus_ has been reported in
cattle and sheep worldwide."

Those involved in the Saudi camel intoxication investigations, mainly in
Saudi Arabia, but including others in neighbouring countries as well as the
French Laboratory which, reportedly, carried out analytical tests, are
invited to contact Dr Bezerra directly or through ProMED-mail. We shall be
glad to be informed of any actions taken. - Mod.AS]
