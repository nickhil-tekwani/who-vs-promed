The number of people in Ashburton who have contracted hepatitis A could be much higher than the 28 cases confirmed so far. The Canterbury District Health Board has begun vaccinating the town's pre-schoolers to try to prevent the spread of the liver disease that kills one in every 50 people who contract it.

Canterbury Medical Officer of Health Dr Alistair Humphrey told Morning Report that nearly all the confirmed cases have been tracked back to a single preschooler who went on holiday overseas with his/her family.

Public health officials say the case demonstrates how important it is to be inoculated before going on holiday.

[Hepatitis A is a liver disease caused by hepatitis A virus. The virus is primarily spread when an uninfected (and unvaccinated) person ingests food or water that is contaminated with the faeces of an infected person. The disease is closely associated with a lack of safe water, inadequate sanitation and poor personal hygiene. Hepatitis A virus is one of the most frequent causes of foodborne infection.

Hepatitis A viruses persist in the environment and can resist food-production processes routinely used to inactivate and/or control bacterial pathogens. The incubation period of hepatitis A is usually 14-28 days. Symptoms of hepatitis A range from mild to severe and can include fever, malaise, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal discomfort, dark-coloured urine and jaundice (a yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes). Adults have signs and symptoms of illness more often than children, and the severity of disease and mortality increase in older age groups. Infected children under 6 years of age do not usually experience noticeable symptoms, and only 10 percent develop jaundice. Among older children and adults, infection usually causes more severe symptoms, with jaundice occurring in more than 70 percent of cases.

There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A. Recovery from symptoms following infection may be slow and may take several weeks or months. Therapy is aimed at maintaining comfort and adequate nutritional balance, including replacement of fluids that are lost from vomiting and diarrhoea. Improved sanitation, food safety and immunization are the most effective ways to combat hepatitis A.

Several hepatitis A vaccines are available internationally. All are similar in terms of how well they protect people from the virus and their side-effects. No vaccine is licensed for children younger than one year of age (see: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs328/en/index.html). The age of the unvaccinated child responsible for the outbreak in Ashburton is not stated.

Outbreaks of hepatitis A virus infection have been frequent in New Zealand. According to the GIDEON database (see: Hepatitis A - New Zealand: background 20060407.1048), 27.9 percent of adults in Christchurch were seropositive for hepatitis A virus infection in a recent seroprevalence survey.

Ashburton is a large town in the Canterbury region, on the east coast of the South Island of New Zealand. The town is the seat of the Ashburton district. The town is located 85 km (53 miles) southwest of Christchurch and is sometimes regarded as a satellite town of Christchurch.
