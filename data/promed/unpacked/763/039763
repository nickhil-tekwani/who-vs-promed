According to Florida Department of Health data, from 1 Jan to 22 Nov 2015, 20 cases of leprosy, or Hansen's disease, have been confirmed. Cases have been reported from the following counties: Alachua (1), Brevard (6), Duval (2), Flagler (1), Indian River (1), Lake (1), Lee (1), Okaloosa (1), Orange (1), Palm Beach (1), Polk (2) and Volusia (2).

According to the CDC's Notifiable Diseases and Mortality Table published on 20 Nov 2015, the cumulative total of Hansen's disease cases stands at 54.

Newly published research in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases [1] shows that the 9-banded armadillo (_Dasypus novemcinctus_), an animal that naturally carries the leprosy bacterium _Mycobacterium leprae_ and which has been linked to zoonotic infections, has spread its geographic range to affect more areas of the southeastern United States. [ProMED-mail recently reported on the results of this study; see ProMED post Leprosy - USA (06): (Southeast) armadillo transmission, spread, RFI 20151119.3802880.]

Historically, armadillos were thought to be free of the infection in this part of the country [southeast U.S.]. According to the results from the study, led by researchers from the National Hansen's Disease Program (NHDP) in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, we find the following: "We screened blood and tissue samples to determine the prevalence of _M. leprae_ infection among 645 armadillos obtained at 8 locations in the southeastern United States (Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida). We detected antibodies to _M. leprae_-specific antigens at each location and in 16.4 percent (106/645) of all the samples screened." In addition, researchers found that some armadillos and patients in the South Florida region had a distinctly different _M. leprae_ genotype strain (3I-2-v15).

The United States sees approximately 150 to 250 leprosy cases annually. 213 new cases were reported in the U.S. in 2009 (the most recent year for which data are available). During the 10-year-period of 2004 to 2014, Florida reported 92 cases, averaging less than 10 per year.

[The study referred to in the news report above (reference 1 above) found that 10 Florida patients who were infected with the strain 3I-2-v15 resided in southern Florida, the only region where armadillos with this same unique _M. leprae_ genotype have been found (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/21/12/15-0501_article#tnF3). It would be interesting to learn whether genotyping _M. leprae_ from the recent Florida patients in the news report above revealed the same highly specific strain of _M. leprae_ (3I-2-v15) found in South Florida or the other unique strain (3I-2-v1) found in southeastern states, or whether the patients had foreign residence at any time in leprosy-endemic regions and, if so, whether _M. leprae_ genotypes reflective of that particular region were found. Information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
