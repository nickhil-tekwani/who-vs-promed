Special programs being planned to control dengue fever
-----------------------------------------------
Dengue fever is in different parts of the Maldives, and measures will
be taken immediately to give protection from it, said Public Health
on Tuesday [7 Feb 2006].
Deputy Director General Ibrahim Shaheem said that dengue fever is a
danger that we must always be aware of and that the appropriate
measures to be taken are being decided upon. "These measures will be
in effect in about 2 days," he said.
Public Health records show that the percentage of people who have
sought treatment for dengue fever has remained constant for some
months now. Shaheem said that, on average, about 5 new cases of
dengue fever are reported every day.
"Among the people who have caught the fever, there is no one who is
seriously ill yet," he said. "It is children who catch dengue the
most."

The Departmental Health Service (SEDES, according to its Spanish
initials) detected a possible case of dengue fever that caused the
death of a 14-year-old male in Brecha Casarabe, a town in Santa Cruz.
Dr. Roberto Torrez, SEDES Epidemiology Chief, pointed out that
technical personnel from his institution were dispatched to the area
in order to investigate whether the case was dengue fever or
pneumonia.
"It is most likely that the patient had died because of pneumonia.
However, responsible persons from the dengue and hantavirus programs
are following up the situation," said the SEDES officer.
He explained that, until now, 4 cases of dengue fever had been
confirmed by the Tropical Diseases Center, 2 of them were reported in
Santa Cruz capital, one in San Carlos, and the other in Yapacani.

Officers to fight dengue at remote island-village
-----------------------------------------------
Health workers from here will be sent to a remote village [Sandakan],
a 3 km boat ride from here, following reports of suspected dengue
cases there.
The Health Department team will travel to Kampung Tondon Bohagin to
conduct fogging in the island-village and brief the people there on
the precautionary measures to take against dengue fever.
Sandakan district health officer Dr. G. Navindran said villagers
there claimed there were at least 5 dengue cases and had called on
the health authorities to take immediate action to prevent a dengue
outbreak.
He added, however, that contrary to the claims by the villagers,
health records here showed there had been only 2 recent cases of
dengue.
