Queensland is facing the worst syphilis outbreak in the last 30 years, warns the Townsville Aboriginal and Islander Health Service.

According to the health group, young Indigenous Australians, gay and bisexual men in Queensland, are at an increased risk of contracting syphilis. Therefore, the public health group has advised young people in north Queensland to get themselves checked for syphilis and avoid unsafe sex.

The syphilis infection rate has shown an increase in the northern Queensland. According to government statistics, more than 33 new cases of sexually transmitted syphilis infections have been reported so far till September [2015]. It also includes one case of congenital syphilis, in which infection is transferred from expecting mothers to the baby.

The Townsville Public Health Unit (TPHU) says that the number of cases of syphilis has grown from 25 to 33 in the past one year. The increase has called for health groups to issue a warning for the Queenslanders. TPHU says that untreated cases could lead to greater risk of HIV infection, reports http://www.news.com.au/national/breaking-news/syphilis-outbreak-prompts-health-warning/news-story/189e4f792b94d0b55090c759b035951d. In addition, congenital syphilis could result in stillbirth, infant death, or miscarriage.

Gay, bisexual, Torres Strait Islander people, and young Aboriginals have been advised to use a condom while making sexual contact. In addition, sexually active young individuals have been asked to visit their local health services.

The SBS [Special Broadcasting Service] reports that people living in remote locations are 300 times more likely to contract syphilis. In addition, babies born to north Queensland's Indigenous communities are at an increased risk of infection.

[There are several different on-going syphilis outbreaks in Queensland, Australia. One outbreak involves men who have sex with men (MSM) in the city of Brisbane in southeastern Queensland; see ProMED-mail post: Syphilis - Australia (03): (QL) MSM, indigenous 20151115.3792153.

Another outbreak involves indigenous people in remote communities in northwestern Queensland that has spread to the Northern Territory and the Kimberley region in the northeastern part of Western Australia; see ProMED-mail posts: Syphilis - Australia (02): (NT,WA) increase, indigenous, congenital, fatal 20151102.3760394; Syphilis - Australia: (NT) increased incidence, indigenous people, RFI 20150713.3507530; Syphilis - Australia (02): (QL) RFI 20141204.3011086; and Syphilis - Australia (03): (QL) indigenous, RFI 20120808.1234631.

The news report above now tells us that the syphilis outbreak in northern Queensland is occurring among "Gay, bisexual, Torres Strait Islander people, and young Aboriginals". The wording, however, is unclear if the gay and bisexual people are the same or different from the Torres Strait Islander people and young Aboriginals. ProMED-mail would appreciate more information in this regard from knowledgeable sources.

ProMED-mail also previously reported on syphilis outbreaks in MSM in urban centers such as Sydney and Melbourne (see ProMED-mail posts Syphilis & gonococcal disease - Australia: MSM, decreasing condom use 20140920.2789253; and Syphilis - Australia: (VI) increased incidence, MSM, HIV co-infection 20140327.2361445).

There was a 3rd outbreak that involved miners and itinerant prostitutes in 2012 in the mining regions of northwestern Queensland (ProMED-mail post Syphilis - Australia: (QL) 20120215.1042038).

For discussions of these syphilis outbreaks, see my moderator comments in the prior ProMED-mail posts.
