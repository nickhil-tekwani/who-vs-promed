Victorians have been warned not to consume a brand of raw eggs after recent cases of salmonellosis in restaurants that were linked to an egg farm. The Green Eggs company, which is based near Ararat, in western Victoria, has been named as the probable cause of the salmonellosis outbreak. New Health Department and biosecurity restrictions have been placed on the farm as investigations continue.

More than 200 people were affected after eating the eggs at restaurants in Torquay and St Kilda.

Egg suppliers have been warned to destroy all eggs sold under the brand, or ensure that they are cooked properly before consumption.

Victoria's chief health officer, Dr Rosemary Lester, said people who may have bought Green Eggs products should ensure that the eggs are cooked thoroughly. She says they should not be eaten with a soft yolk. Dr Lester said it would be a few more days until the department could be "100 percent" certain that the Green Eggs company had indeed been at fault, though initial investigations certainly implicated the farm.

[The serotype of _S. enterica_ has not been identified in this significant outbreak of salmonellosis in Australia's Victoria state in the southern part of the country. Victoria is the island nation's most populous state.

Salmonellosis is often thought to be associated with cracked eggs or eggs dirty with fecal matter, a problem controlled by cleaning procedures implemented in the egg industry. It is clearly the case, however, that most of the salmonellosis outbreaks linked to eggs were associated with uncracked, disinfected Grade A eggs, or foods containing such eggs. The undamaged eggs become contaminated during ovulation, and thus were contaminated with the bacteria before the egg shell was formed. - Mod.LL
