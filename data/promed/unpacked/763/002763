Three more farms affected by foot and mouth disease in the Netherlands
--------------------------------
Outbreak 8 is in calves on a farm at Kootwijkerbroek (20 km west of
Apeldoorn). The animals were destroyed 2 days ago, after clinical signs
appeared. There are about 200 other farms within 2 km of this one, with
pigs, veal calves, goats, and dairy cattle. It is also close to the largest
Dutch Nature reserve "De Hoge Veluwe".
Outbreak 9 is [on a farm with cattle, goats and sheep at Oosterwolde (15
km NW of Oene). This has been a suspect for some time and was slaughtered
out [? some days ago. The farm had direct contact with outbreak 1 in Oene,
through movement of goats. There are about 30 farms within 2km of this one.
Outbreak 10 is [on a dairy farm at Oosterwolde, 100 metres from [the
outbreak 9 [farm. Human contact is suspected. In an area of 2km around
these new cases, animals are being vaccinated while they await destruction.
