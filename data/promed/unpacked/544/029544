As you so appropriately noted, the spread of MDR TB in the world is quite
worrisome. You noted that you do not routinely post info on the rates of TB
or it's spread. I would like to request that you reconsider this position.
MDR TB is growing at an increasingly alarming rate. Monitoring the rate
and spread of this disease could help project trends in the future. Like
the rest of the former Soviet Union, Uzbekistan also has a growing TB
problem. In the Region of Karakalpakistan, (western Uzbekistan) MDR TB is
the primary form of the disease affecting over 1 000 000 people.
The current environmental disaster affecting the Aral sea region is also
contributing to the spread on MDR TB in Central Asia. A recent study by MSF
in Karakalpakistan randomly surveyed 881 people over the age of 18 years
asked the question of whether they would consider moving. 75% of the
respondents related that they have considered moving from the region. The
migration of ill individuals throughout Central Asia is a major concern for
health care providers in this part of the world. I believe that the
movement of other ill populations from one area to another will also affect
other populations and providers in the future.

[We bow to the man on the spot in temporarily lifting our embargo on
MDR-TB. We would hope other Medical Attaches would consider sending us
emerging disease information from their regions. Reports from all sources
are welcome. - Mod.JW
