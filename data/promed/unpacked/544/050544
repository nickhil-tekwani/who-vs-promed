Myanmar confirms bird flu outbreak in 5 townships in Yangon
-----------------------------------------------
The Myanmar livestock authorities have confirmed that 5 townships in
Yangon [formerly Rangoon] have been hit by an H5N1 outbreak,
according to a statement of the Livestock Breeding and Veterinary
Department (LBVD) released on Tue 27 Mar 2007.
The 5 townships are Mayangon, Hlaingtharya, North Okkalapa,
Mingaladon and Hmawby.
Poultry, quail and pheasants of the affected farms together with
those from possibly affected farms and from farms that are contiguous
to the affected farms were culled and necessary preventive measures
are being taken, the statement said.
Although the H5N1 strain of bird flu was found at some poultry farms
in the 5 townships, the dead bodies of some chickens and geese from
several other townships in Yangon and Bago divisions were not found
to be infected with bird flu, it said. Of the 324 crows, pigeons,
sparrows, and doves, which died during the period since the end of
February 2007, only 6 crows were suspected of being infected with
avian influenza. The others died of heat stroke, chronic bronchitis
and small [sic] pox.
The authorities have warned breeders and those engaged in poultry
marketing to use new farm equipment instead of old and to ensure that
crows do not enter poultry farms.
Suspected avian influenza was 1st detected on 27 Feb 2007 by Myanmar
in a small private poultry farm in northwestern Yangon's suburban
township of Mayangon. In the outbreak, 1863 fowl died of the virus,
with 37 883 culled, according to an earlier statement of the LBVD.
Meanwhile, 2 townships, Mayangon and Hlaingtharya, have been further
confirmed to be involved in the bird flu outbreak by experts of the
United Nations Food and the Agriculture Organization (FAO) and UNAID.
The FAO agreed on 10 Mar 2007 to provide immediate technical
assistance to strengthen emergency preparedness for highly pathogenic
avian influenza. The assistance also includes equipment worth USD 600
000 donated by USAID to be used in preventive measures against the disease.
According to the Myanmar authorities, no human cases have so far been
detected with bird flu virus in Yangon.

Bird flu cases surge in new areas
-------------------------------------
New cases of a deadly strain of bird flu have been confirmed in
Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, and in the southern province of
Kandahar over the past week, according to the Afghan health ministry.
A dead bird found in the garden of the Turkish embassy in Kabul on 20
Mar 2007 was infected with the deadly H5N1 strain of the avian
influenza virus, health officials confirmed to IRIN on Wed 28 Mar
2007. A quarantine that had been imposed on the embassy compound was
lifted after a team of medical workers from the health ministry
completed a bird-culling operation there. "The blood test of an
embassy driver who was injured by a bird has shown no sign of avian
influenza," the ministry report said.
On 23 Mar 2007, 2 more cases of bird flu [in poultry] were confirmed
in Kabul, a city with an estimated population of more than 3.5
million people. Over the past week, bird flu was also detected in
the Damaan and Shah Wali Kot districts of Kandahar province in the
south of the country. Officials in Kabul say that insecurity is
impeding their efforts to curb the spread of the virus in Shah Wali
Kot, where insurgents have repeatedly attacked government employees.
In an effort to mitigate the outbreak of avian influenza in
Afghanistan, the World Health Organization (WHO) on 25 Mar 2007
called on Afghans to stop buying and selling live birds. "To prevent
transmission of avian influenza to humans, WHO is recommending that
persons residing in Kabul, Nangarhar and Kunar provinces avoid the
live bird markets until no disease has been reported for several
months, because avian influenza can spread to humans from
contaminated dust and feathers of infected birds," WHO said in a
statement. In addition, WHO has requested Afghan bird-lovers to
refrain from petting and touching their birds.
But given the important socio-economic role of birds in the life of
many ordinary Afghans, both recommendations are difficult, if not
unrealistic, for civilians. "I have been doing this business
[selling live birds] for over 4 years. I have no other means to feed
my extended family," said one bird-seller in Kabul.
Officials in Afghanistan's committee against avian influenza said it
would be difficult to close live bird markets in the country.
"I think both economically and socially it is impossible to close all
bird markets," Abdullah Fahim, a spokesman for Afghanistan's Ministry
of Health, told IRIN on Wed 28 Mar 2007.
Afghanistan's 1st bird flu case was reported in March 2006.
More than 20 cases of bird flu [in poultry] have been confirmed in
the country since February 2007, many in the eastern provinces of
Nangarhar and Kunar. [Konar, map at

The Afghan government has prohibited the importation of live birds
and poultry products from neighboring Pakistan, where several cases
of avian influenza [in poultry] have also been confirmed.
To date, no human case of bird flu has been confirmed among the
estimated 25 million inhabitants of Afghanistan.
