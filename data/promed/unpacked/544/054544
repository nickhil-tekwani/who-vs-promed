A bat found hanging from the basket of a motorized wheelchair at Wal-Mart at 10224 Coors Bypass NW in Albuquerque on Tuesday [2 Jun 2015] morning has tested positive for rabies, and anyone who had contact with it is urged to contact health authorities.

The state Department of Health said in a news release that the bat was found about 9 a.m. Tuesday [2 Jun 2015] as a customer was at the checkout counter at the Wal-Mart supercenter just northwest of Cottonwood Mall. A person who helped remove the bat from the cart was bitten and is expected to begin receiving a series of vaccinations for rabies, which can be fatal, health officials said.

"We would like anyone who may have touched this bat or handled it in any way to give us a call so we can interview them for possible exposure to rabies," Health Secretary Retta Ward said in a statement. "Just being near or in the vicinity of the bat is not an exposure." Anyone who handled or touched the bat should call the Department of Health at 505-827-0006.

That includes the person who was driving the motorized wheelchair, a spokesman told the Journal on Thursday [4 Jun 2015] afternoon. The customer, after the bat was cleared, paid for groceries and left the premises.

The department said it would not say whether the person who was bitten was a Wal-Mart employee because of patient confidentiality.

"In New Mexico, bats, skunks and foxes are reservoirs for rabies, and they can transmit rabies to people, pets, livestock or other wild animals," said Dr. Paul Ettestad, public health veterinarian with the department. "We urge everyone to vaccinate their pets and livestock against rabies; vaccination is one of the most effective public health tools we have to prevent humans from being exposed to rabies."

People are encouraged to report bats that may have bitten or been handled by someone, or bats that appear sick -- lying on the ground or not moving when approached -- to 311, said Dr. Mark DiMenna of the city of Albuquerque Environmental Health Department. "People should wait for help rather than handling the bat themselves," he said.

[One must wonder how the arriving 8:30 AM motorized wheelchair rider did not notice the bat when they 1st sat in it.

If you must handle one of these bats, 1st find a refrigerator-quality medium-duty plastic bag, a.k.a. "Gladbag;" turn it inside out; put your hand into the bag and grasp the bat, preferably in a way it cannot bite you; and place the bat and the bag in a small cardboard box you can close. You may want to get vaccinated just in case afterwards. And look around. If there is 1 sick bat, there will be other sick bats about or a nearby bat-roost this bat may have fallen out of. - Mod.MHJ]

Rockingham County health officials are warning residents after more than 24 cats were recently exposed to rabies. Animal Control officials picked up a colony of 25 cats on Saturday [6 Jun 2015] from Settle Bridge Road following the exposure. All the cats were euthanized.

The cats were exposed to the virus Thursday [4 Jun 2015] by a kitten that turned aggressive and attacked litter mates, county health officials said. A relative took the kitten to a vet on Friday [5 Jun 2015], and the kitten tested positive for rabies on Saturday [6 Jun 2015].

Health officials ask anyone who may have been around cats in the Settle Bridge Road area since 20 May 2015 to call the Rockingham County health department at 336-342-5163.

A family dog on St. Simons Island that fought recently with a raccoon tested positive for rabies after being euthanized, prompting the treatment of 2 island residents for the disease, the Glynn County Health Department reports.

It is the 2nd instance this year [2015] of a family pet being exposed to the disease in Glynn County. The 1st pet was a dog exposed to a rabid fox in January 2015 that wreaked havoc in a Glynn County neighborhood, causing 2 people to seek treatment for the potentially deadly disease.

Sally Silbermann, spokeswoman for the Coastal Health District, which includes Glynn County, said animals are tested for rabies only if there is potential human exposure. Animals must be dead for the brain to be tested for rabies.

The dog lived in West Point Plantation on St. Simons Island and was not up to date on rabies vaccinations, Silbermann said in a release about the rabies case. The people are being treated as a precautionary measure, she added.

Raccoons are known to be one of the most common carriers of rabies and are plentiful on the coast, said Erin Doane, assistant environmental health manager for the Glynn County Health Department. "A lot of wild animals that are native to our area -- like raccoons and foxes -- are known carriers of rabies," Doane said. "That's why it is so important to make sure that pets are vaccinated against the virus."

Glynn County is no stranger to rabies. In the past 18 months, there have been at least 6 potentially rabid fox interactions with humans and several other instances with raccoons.

The health department advises residents to get pets vaccinated for the disease. Rabies is spread primarily by infected animals. Symptoms include changes in behavior, biting, aggression, showing no fear of natural enemies, foaming at the mouth and paralysis. Never feed, handle or unintentionally attract wild animals with open garbage cans or by leaving pet food out at night, health officials say. Never adopt wild animals or bring them into your home, and teach children the same thing, health officials advise.

If an animal bites you, seek medical attention immediately and contact Glynn County Animal Control at 554-7500 and the Glynn County Health Department's Environmental Health Division at 279-2940.

[At the risk of being repetitive:
- Avoid contact with wild animals you don't know, and especially animals out at an unusual time of day and/or demonstrating unusual aggressive or passive behaviour;
- Never adopt wild animals or bring them into your home. Do not try to nurse sick animals to health. Call animal control or a properly licensed animal rescue agency for assistance.
- Make sure your pets receive the proper immunizations. Dogs and cats should get rabies vaccines by 4 months of age, followed by a booster shot 1 year later and another shot every one or 3 years depending on the type of vaccine used;
- Teach children to never handle unfamiliar animals, wild or domestic, even if they appear friendly. "Love your own, leave other animals alone" is a good principle for children to learn. - Mod.MHJ]

[Bats are charming creatures, but always be cautious when handling them or in places infested by them. I speak from experience, having seen multiple species in a Mexican volcanic vent/bat guano mine, collected vampire bats in Brazil and Mexican FreeTails in the French Quarter of New Orleans, and seen more than a few colonies in Texas latterly, which is why for years I kept my rabies shots up to date until my doctor persuaded me that my blood titre was quite adequate. - Mod.MHJ
