Pest found in Tasmanian broccoli crop
---------------------
A fungus that has devastated part of the Victorian broccoli crop has been
detected in Tasmania. 4 crops infected with "white blister" have been
destroyed in the state's northwest, but authorities are confident the
disease can be contained. Scientist Dean Metcalf says the disease was
brought into the state on the wings of diamond back moths.
According to Metcalf, the moths have been in Werribee in Victoria and had
been blown by wind over Bass Strait. Some of these moths are carrying the
spores of the disease. After flying over Bass Strait they feed on broccoli
plants. Metcalf regards it as a quite a new and interesting phenomenon that
amazed scientists.

[The outbreak of white blister of broccoli in Tasmania is a good example of
long-distance movement of viable spores being able to initiate disease.
White blister is caused by the fungus _Albugo candida_ [Ac] (Pers.) Kuntze.
An epidemic of the disease has been damaging broccoli and cauliflower in
the Werribee district of Victoria during the 2002 season.
Although white blister occurs in Queensland on Chinese cabbage and some
cruciferous weeds like Shepherd's purse, it has never been a problem on the
main brassica crops (cabbage, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, and broccoli)
in Victoria.
There are 8 or more races of Ac occurring throughout the world, each of
which infects a limited range of brassica species. There is a possibility
that the pathogen causing the epidemic in Victoria could be a different
race than the one commonly found in Queensland.
Symptoms of white blister appear on leaves as yellow-brown spots on the
upper surface and small, raised, white blisters (approximately 1- 2 mm in
diameter), or pustules, underneath. Swellings may also be found on roots,
stems, and flowers. The swellings and pustules contain masses of white
dusty spores.
Severely affected leaves and heads may exhibit abnormal growth. Systemic
infections can cause plant distortion, that leads to a significant
reduction in marketability of flower heads and affects seed production.
Optimal germination of spores occurs under moist conditions (10-14 degrees
C) such as during periods of heavy dew or fog. Once infection has
commenced, the disease develops well at temperatures up to 25 degrees C.
The Department of Primary Industries (DPI) is considering the possibility
that the Victorian outbreak may indicate the presence of a race of Ac that
is different from the race currently endemic in Queensland. There is a real
risk of introduction of this possible new and potentially serious race of
the pathogen into this State's brassica production areas, particularly on
imported cruciferous transplants and harvested produce (such as broccoli
and cauliflower heads).
Farmers are advised to ensure that measures are being used to minimise the
risk of seed-borne spread. Hot water treatment (HWT) could be an effective
seed disinfestation agent, but no information is available on temperature
or duration of the treatment. Such advice should be obtained from seed
suppliers.
DPI pathologists are acting to prevent the spread of the possible new
strains of white blister into Queensland, using enacted legislation under
the Plant Protection Act 1989 to prohibit the introduction of plants of
_Brassica_ spp.into Queensland without an inspector's approval.
The information provided in my comments relates to the disease in
Queensland and Victoria but presumably is relevant to the outbreak in Tasmania.
