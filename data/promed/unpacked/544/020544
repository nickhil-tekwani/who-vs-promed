A one-year-old boy has been in the intensive care unit for the last week under sedation fighting Rocky Mountain spotted fever, a rare tick-borne infection caused by a common wood tick. "It's so new a lot of the people we meet [at the hospital] say they have never seen a case here," said the mother.

The infection is most common across the central USA from the Carolinas to Kansas, but it is suspected he picked it up in a new development in Buffalo, MN, which also happens to be his backyard. "We don't live in a wooded area, we don't live in northern Minnesota," his mother said. "It is just an open field, a farm field.

A 104-degree [F, 40 C] fever and a rash initially led to a hand, foot and mouth disease diagnosis, but after continued deterioration, he was rushed to Children's Minnesota in Minneapolis. His older sister also developed a high fever and rash and is being treated for the same infection. "She has no life-threatening risk at this moment, so she will be tested in 4 to 6 weeks to see," the mother said.

This family is sharing their story to raise awareness, knowing this frightening disease can be deadly, especially for young children. "My neighborhood is not a traditional tick neighborhood," she said. "I just want people to be aware."

The Minnesota Department of Health is aware of the case and is investigating.

[It is vital to diagnose rickettsial infections promptly to minimize morbidity and mortality. In states such as Minnesota, where the disease is somewhat less endemic than the Middle Atlantic states of North Carolina and Tennessee and the central states of Missouri and Oklahoma, it is particularly important to think of this infection.

When a female _Dermacentor_ tick harboring the organism attaches to a passing human, she usually starts low on the body after transferring from grassy vegetation or even directly or indirectly from a dog. After crawling around on clothes, seeking an appropriate cutaneous site (wearing white clothes makes a wandering tick easier to spot), she attaches and begins to feed. If the tick is not already partially fed, after attaching it generally takes 24 hours to activate and transmit the rickettsial organism. For this reason, daily or twice-daily tick checks with removal will minimize disease transmission. Ticks that attach in hairy areas such as the scalp or beard may be more difficult to find.

The presenting illness is generally nonspecific: fever, muscle pains, and headache (which is usually described as severe). The rash begins on day 3 of the illness, initially maculopapular at the wrists and ankles before becoming petechial and purpuric, involving the palms and soles as well as spreading proximally to the trunk. Purpura usually is not seen before the 6th day of illness. The mortality is indeed low if treatment (usually a tetracycline) is begun during the first 2 days of the rash or before. The classical rash and its progression look nothing like that of hand, foot and mouth disease.

Empiric treatment for this infection should always be begun in people with compatible symptoms inhabiting endemic areas during the spring and summer, even if no tick bite is known.

As of 1 Jan 2010, cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) are reported (https://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/stats/index.html) under a new category called Spotted Fever Rickettsiosis (SFR). This category captures cases of RMSF, _Rickettsia parkeri_ rickettsiosis, Pacific Coast tick fever, and rickettsialpox. The change reflects the inability to differentiate between spotted fever group _Rickettsia_ species using commonly available serologic tests. The map at this URL gives the annual incidence of the infection in Minnesota at 3-7 cases/million population.

Buffalo is a city in the state of Minnesota and the county seat of Wright County. It is within the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area, located 42 miles northwest of Minneapolis. - Mod.LL
