The horrific death of yet another person with rabies under my care prompts
me to take back to the public once again the issue of the [policies] of
the National Institute of Health, Islamabad.
A 6-year-old Sindhi /Baloch boy was bitten on the face by a stray dog 1
month back. The father took him to Lyari General Hospital immediately where
he was given first aid, prescribed a Rs 800 injection (presumably the
much-needed Rabies Immune Globulin) and asked to come back daily for the
next 14 days for Sheep Brain Vaccine (SBV) injections into the abdominal
wall. On being assured this was the best possible treatment, the father
complied dutifully till the last dose.
Predictably, 4 weeks later the boy died of rabies, in a manner which
wreaked sorrow and pity from bystanders.
In their book "Rabies: Myths and Facts," written by 2 eminent physicians
from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi, first edition,
1995, pp 86-87, the authors write: "The vaccine (SBV) is cheap, (about five
rupees per dose), painful and is far less efficacious... it is quite
useless as proved by the lack of production of the neutralizing antibodies
in cases of most of the vaccines. The vaccine is available in most of the
centers for the prophylaxis of rabies in the civil sector of Pakistan. As
far as possible its use should be discouraged and the more efficacious
vaccine must be used, regardless of their cost, to save the life of the
victim."
A huge outcry was raised by leading physicians from across the country.
Explanation from the NIH [Pakistan] regarding the [continued] use of less than
efficacious treatment has not been forthcoming. Surely it cannot be a
matter of money, as even the poorest person will spend all he has to
purchase the effective cell line rabies vaccine, which is available at most
chemists for Rs 800 per dose for 5 doses.

(Dr. Naseem Salahuddin is en route to present this case at an international
rabies conference, where she will be discussing the SBV/NIH policies in
Pakistan. WHO has mandated that NIH [Pakistan] maintain an active
surveillance program for vaccine failure (perhaps this is not what is
needed -- we need to ban this vaccine and have a better alternative) -
still the funding to set up this surveillance system has not yet been
released. Life as it might be in Pakistan is very inexpensive. RC)
