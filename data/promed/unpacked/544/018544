Melioidosis had claimed one life in the state among the total of 40 cases reported this year [2012] which is a significant drop from last year which recorded 121 cases and 11 deaths. The figure was disclosed by state Health Department director Datu Dr Zulkifli Jantan. "There were no clusters as all were sporadic cases and unrelated," he said.

Giving the breakdown by divisions, he added that Kapit had the highest number of melioidosis cases at 28, followed by Kuching (4), 2 each in Mukah and Miri, while Sibu, Sarikei and Samarahan had only one case," Dr Zulkifli told The Borneo Post in an e-mail reply yesterday [30 Dec 2012].

"In 2011, the deaths -- 7 were from Kapit; Miri (2) and 1 each from Kuching and Bintulu. Most deaths were because of delay in getting treatment," he said.

He added that loggers, laborers clearing new land for plantations, and farmers were most at risk in contracting the disease. "Workers in close contact with moist soil for example, farmers, logging camp workers have higher risk of contracting melioidosis, while those going for jungle trekking should also take necessary precautions," Dr Zulkifli advised.

He suggested those whose work exposed them to higher risk of contracting melioidosis should wear boots. He also reminded members of the public to be alert to signs and symptoms such as fever, breathing problem, abscesses in skins and organs, or general illness. Meanwhile, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) explained that melioidosis, also called Whitmore's disease, is an infectious disease that could infect humans and animals.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) website further stated the disease is caused by the bacterium _Burkholderia pseudomallei_, adding that it occurs predominantly in the tropics, especially in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia, where it is widespread. The bacterium causing melioidosis is found in contaminated water and soil. It is spread to humans and animals through direct contact with a contaminated source.

[Melioidosis mainly affects people who have direct contact with soil and water. Many have an underlying predisposing condition such as diabetes (commonest risk factor), renal disease, cirrhosis, thalassemia, alcohol dependence, immunosuppressive therapy, chronic obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, or excess kava consumption. (Kava is an herbal member of the pepper family that can be associated with chronic liver disease.) HIV infection, however, may not a clear risk factor for more severe disease. Melioidosis may present at any age, but peaks in the 4th and 5th decades of life, affecting men more than women. In addition, although severe fulminating infection can and does occur in healthy individuals, severe disease and fatalities are much less common in those without risk factors.

In acute severe melioidosis, there is characteristically the rapid progression of respiratory failure that is due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and/or pneumonia. It has been suggested that the ARDS to melioidosis sepsis is more rapid in progression than with other bacteria and may be related to the intracellular interactions of the bacillus and the leukocyte. Bacteremia without shock/hypotension has a substantially better prognosis.
