A measles epidemic has hit North Korea, causing at least 4 deaths and
infecting some 3000 people.
Measles has been found in 30 North Korean counties since the outbreak
started in November [2006], the Red Cross said, and added, "The
continued presence of the measles is accompanied by a risk of
increasing cases and the further spread of the illness to other parts
of the country."
North Korean health authorities notified the Red Cross, World Health
Organisation (WHO) and other international bodies of the outbreak
last week [week of 11 Feb 2007] and the impoverished state requested
5 million doses of measles vaccine. Reclusive North Korea allows some
UN agencies to operate within its borders.
In November [2006], South Korea's Yonhap news agency said North Korea
could be facing a scarlet fever pandemic.
Measles remains a leading cause of death among young children in the
region, despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine for
the past 40 years.
The WHO estimated 345 000 people, the majority of them children, died
from measles worldwide in 2005.
Almost all the deaths occurred in developing countries.

A measles epidemic that has hit isolated North Korea has killed 4
people and infected around 3000, according to the Red Cross.
The North has asked for 5 million doses of vaccine to fight the
epidemic, said a statement from the International Federation of Red
Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).
"Since November 2006 some 3000 people in 30 counties throughout the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) have been
diagnosed with cases of the measles," said the statement.
On [4 Jan 2007,] 2 children and 2 adults died from the disease and
complications like pneumonia, and 1013 people were receiving treatment.
"A mass vaccination campaign is currently under way," it said.
There have also been separate reports of outbreaks of scarlet fever
and typhoid in recent months in the reclusive communist state, where
medicine is in short supply and years of malnutrition have weakened
resistance to disease.
Since December [2006] South Korean private groups have shipped
penicillin and antibiotics to North Korea, saying scarlet fever and
other communicable diseases are spreading fast (see ProMED-mail
posting Bacterial disease outbreaks - North Korea (Hamgyong-Bukto):
RFI 20070125.0329).
The IFRC said the North's health authorities confirmed the measles
outbreak only on [15 Feb 2007] because it believed the disease had
been eradicated in 1992 and health workers were not familiar with the
symptoms. North Korea's ministry of public health, the Red Cross
authorities, the World Health Organization, and UNICEF have since
been in talks to fight the disease.
Pyongyang has asked the international community for 5 million doses
of vaccine with disposable syringes at a cost of some 1.5 million
dollars, the IFRC said.

[According to the WHO website, there were no cases of measles
reported from North Korea in 1990, nor were there any cases reported
during the period 2001 through 2005
(<http://www.who.int/vaccines/globalsummary/immunization/countryprofileresult.cfm?C='prk'>).
Vaccination coverages during this period were high (1990 / 98
percent; 2000 / 92 percent; 2001/ 92 percent; 2002 / 98 percent; 2003
/ 95 percent; 2004 / 95 percent; and 2005/ 96 percent). These
reported coverages are for single doses of measles vaccine and not
for 2nd doses (most countries have adopted a 2-dose schedule for
measles vaccination). Of note, when one reviews the full time series
for estimated vaccination coverages, one can see years with extremely
low reported coverages (less than 40 percent in 1997, 1998, and 1980
through 1984, see
<http://www.who.int/vaccines/globalsummary/immunization/timeseries/tscoveragebycountry.cfm?country=Democratic%20People's%20Republic%20of%20Korea>).

It would be interesting to know the age distribution of cases in this
current measles epidemic to know if there are indications to add a
2nd dose of vaccine and or implement a vaccination campaign aimed at
an older age group (those born since 1980). From the above newswires
2 of the 4 deaths occurred in adults, suggesting that the age
distribution may well include many adults in this outbreak. As an
aside, with an estimated population of 23 113 019 (see
<https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/print/kn.html>) that
brings the overall population-based rate of measles in this outbreak
to 13 per 100 000 population, higher than any of the reported rates
in the Western Pacific Region of the WHO in 2005 and 2006 (see
<http://www.wpro.who.int/NR/rdonlyres/9C284BEA-0524-487F-9294-2858236904D3/0/MeasBulletinIssue11.pdf>)
