CHOLERA - SOMALIA
=================
WEEKLY EPIDEMIOLOGICAL RECORD, No. 16, 18 APRIL 1997, p.116
Cholera - Somalia.
Outbreaks of acute diarrhoea and cholera have continued to occur in various
parts of the country since late 1996. Cholera has been confirmed and
continues to be reported in Mogadishu and Marka, and new outbreaks were
reported in Lower Shabelle Region. The total number of cholera cases
(including suspect cases) reported since the first case on 30 November 1996
is 1535 with 47 deaths.
The number of cases in Mogadishu North has almost tripled in the last weeks
following recent heavy rainfalls, according to the latest report from the
WHO country representative. Although the treatment centre is coping well
with the increased cases, medical supplies are running short and WHO is
trying to purchase these elsewhere. ECHO (European Community for
Humanitarian Action) is also providing support and sending supplies.
A WHO consultant, who was already in Mogadishu to study cholera transmission
there and to assist in setting up a cholera committee, will now extend his
stay to help deal with the increasing number of cases. However, in recently
affected rural areas coordination of control activities is difficult. Based
on trends of cholera outbreaks in previous years, a decline in numbers is
expected in the next 6 to 8 weeks. The remote areas affected will continue
to be difficult to reach because of insecurity and logistical constraints.
Cholera task forces meet regularly to review the situation.
