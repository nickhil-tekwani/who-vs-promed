SENASAG [Servicio Nacional de Sanidad Agropecuaria e Inocuidad Alimentaria (National Agricultural Health and Food Safety Service)] established an epidemiological barrier in the communities of the Valle Alto region [south east Cochabamba department] after the deaths of 8 heads of cattle as a result of a rabies outbreak in Collpaciaco (Arani [province]), located 70 km [43 mi] from Cochabamba city.

SENASAG of Cochabamba stated that the reported cases in Collpaciaco are a small outbreak of bovine rabies that to date has had 2 laboratory confirmed cases, 2 under observation, and 2 samples have been taken.

According to the Director of SENASAG, Efrain Ricaldi, once the 1st cases were detected, the epidemiological barrier was implemented, and vaccination of cattle and capture of hematophagous bats (vampires) that transmit the virus that infects the nervous system of the animals, were initiated.

The bats will be captured with nets in order to apply a poison [warfarin or related compounds] on their backs. When they go to their roosting places (abandoned houses, the convent, hollow trees), [the poison] is licked off by their roost mates.

SENASAG has begun capture of bats, vaccination of cattle, and revaccination of dogs, a species also vulnerable to bat bites that represents a high [public health] risk due to their closeness to humans.

The Director of SENASAG stated that they are going to intensify their efforts in order to interrupt this transmission despite that they cannot count on government financing, which as of this year [2012], was suspended for various programs, among them livestock vaccination against bovine rabies.

Vaccination and elimination of the bats that feed on cattle and spread the virus are done with resources from SENASAG. Also, the work is aided by laboratory testing to certify [diagnostic] results. "Despite limited resources, we are working and achieving control, verifying [cases] in the laboratory, burying animals that have died of rabies because of the danger," said the SENASAG Director.

SENASAG stated that earlier outbreaks of bovine rabies in Valle Alto have been controlled. The latest outbreaks were registered in Toco and Cuchu Muela, where 20 cows died, of which 8 gave positive results for bovine rabies.

Residents of Collpaciaco wept for the economic losses that the deaths of their cattle represented. They said that in the more than 40 years that they have lived in that area they never saw their cattle die of bovine rabies.

More than one [of the residents] attributed the outbreak of the disease to the extreme drought that affects Valle Alto and, especially in Arani, to the high temperatures. But the only certainty up to now is that the virus is transmitted by hematophagous bats -- which feed on blood -- that have proliferated in dozens of abandoned houses and the historical Collpaciaco convent.

The residents lament the loss of their cattle, the worth of each one estimated at between 7000-8000 Bolivianos [USD 1013-1158]. However, SENASAG states that this is a small outbreak and that not all cattle are ill, so they urge cattle owners not to be tempted by speculators who take advantage of these situations to purchase cattle at a low prices. SENASAG, which has worked for many years in animal and herd health, took note that various livestock owners indicated that their cattle were vaccinated against bovine rabies a few months ago.

Residents of Collpaciaco demand compensation for their economic losses from the government and the Arani provincial administration.

Currently, the health system has been mobilized for revaccination of dogs. The goal is to immunize 400 dogs that might be bitten by bats that are carriers of the virus.

Also, 6 people who decided to slaughter and butcher a cow for human consumption before the 1st outbreak of bovine rabies are under observation and are receiving post exposure rabies vaccine. Although the meat is not risky, there exists possible infection from handling the raw meat, which is why the people are vaccinated. The populace also agreed to not sell cattle or slaughter them until the emergency has passed.

There are approximately 1000 inhabitants in Collpaciaco and their cattle are an important part of the economy of the few families that still live in the area and have not migrated to the city.

[Rabies is a sporadic, ongoing problem in Bolivia, with cases occurring in dogs and cattle, with spillover to humans. The bat involved in these cases is the vampire bat (_Desmodus rotundus_), which occurs throughout tropical and subtropical areas in the Americas. Interestingly, a recent study casts doubt on the effectiveness of vampire bat control to reduce rabies transmission. However, an aggressive vaccination campaign of bovine animals and dogs in the area is prudent. It would be wise to vaccinate equine animals as well, because vampire bats may feed on them, too.

Although the risk of acquiring rabies virus infection through the consumption of meat from infected animals is very low, it is never prudent to consume tissues from any animals that are ill or dead. Conceivably, there might be risk of rabies virus infection from brain tissue removed and handled without gloves from rabies virus infected cattle for human consumption ("sesos"), which is a common dish in many parts of Latin America.
