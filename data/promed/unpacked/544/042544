APS Conference: new data
By browsing through the abstracts of papers presented at the APS/ESA Joint Annual Meeting (Las
Vegas, US, 1998-11-08/12), the EPPO Secretariat has extracted the following data concerning
quarantine pests or pests of potential quarantine interest.

Garnsey, S.; Behe, C.G.; Lockhart, B.E. (1998) Transmission of citrus yellow mosaic badnavirus by
the citrus mealybug (S43). Abstracts of papers presented at the APS/ESA Joint Annual Meeting,

Citrus mosaic disease
--------------------------
It has previously been reported that citrus mosaic disease (EU Annex II/A1) is associated with a
badnavirus (EPPO RS 96/137). This disease is widely distributed in India, especially on sweet
orange (_Citrus sinensis_) and pummelo (_C. grandis_). Studies made in quarantine conditions in
Florida (USA) showed that an Indian isolate of citrus mosaic badnavirus could be experimentally
transmitted with _Planococcus citri_ [the citrus mealy bug] to sweet orange seedlings (S31).

[Transmission of the citrus yellow mosaic virus by the citrus mealy bug to virus-free sweet orange
seedlings is a step forward in understanding the etiology of citrus yellow mosaic disease. Mealy
bugs remained viruliferous [virus-bearing] for at least 24 hours after removal from donor source
plants. Should the virus be introduced into the USA, dispersal of the virus into commercial
production areas would be a potential hazard - Mod.DH].
