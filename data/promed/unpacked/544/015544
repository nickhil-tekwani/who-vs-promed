[2] Rapid response medical teams

Rapid response medical teams launched by WHO to fight any Ebola-like emergency
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organisation today [9 Apr 2015] launched a new network of rapid response medical teams for deployment in emergencies including humanitarian crises like the Ebola outbreak, earthquakes, famines, and chemical spills. The UN body is building a new registration system to build a global roster of Foreign Medical Teams (FMTs) ready for emergency deployment around the globe.

"The other part of WHO's lessons learnt after Ebola is that we require a global emergency workforce. Foreign medical teams will form a key pillar in the global emergency workforce," said Ian Norton, WHO's project leader for FMTs." What this will mean is a predictable, qualified and pre-registered? capacity and we are not talking of individual doctors but about teams because medical staff are only as good as their logistic support and their organisation," he said.

FMTs are groups of health professionals like doctors, nurses, and paramedics that treat patients affected by emergency or disasters and had to comply with minimum standards set by the WHO in 2013. There has been a considerable interest in registering in Asia, particularly from China, Indonesia, and Philippines and the expected registration toll would be 150 in the 1st year, the UN body said.

Asked about Indian involvement in the project, Norton said: "The [Indian] foreign affairs department is very interested in this. It is a sign of solidarity to another nation state. We are very hopeful that India will register teams that they feel can go internationally. We definitely need to have them on the list." India has taken the approach that they would use the technical standards in the blue book [the minimum standards prescribed by WHO in 2013 for a FMT] but apply them to their national teams and for their own domestic preparedness.

"If a team is coming from Gujarat to another ministerial area then they are expected to meet those standards,' said the UN official.

The WHO said that the registration system is a "quality assurance process" where teams upon submission of registration request will have a visit from the WHO and will also be subjected to peer review.

It allows for capacity building for all sorts of specific hazards or an all-hazards approach in emergency response. Specific teams will have specialised skills for instance in chemical spills. Every country does not have to build niche capabilities but it will ask the neighbours or the world to come in with that [specialised FMT] team. "It allows them to spend their health dollars on malaria and dengue instead of something that will not come in the next 20 years," said Norton.

[3] Ebola active monitoring system

Ebola Active Monitoring System for Travelers Returning from West Africa -- Georgia, 2014-2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: M Parham, L Edison, K Soetebier, et al]

The Ebola virus disease (Ebola) epidemic in West Africa has so far produced approximately 25 000 cases, more than 40 times the number in any previously documented Ebola outbreak. Because of the risk for imported disease from infected travelers, in October 2014 CDC recommended that all travelers to the United States from Ebola-affected countries receive enhanced entry screening and post-arrival active monitoring for Ebola signs or symptoms until 21 days after their departure from an Ebola-affected country.

The state of Georgia began its active monitoring program on 25 Oct 2014. The Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) modified its existing, web-based electronic notifiable disease reporting system to create an Ebola Active Monitoring System (EAMS). DPH staff members developed EAMS from conceptualization to implementation in 6 days. In accordance with CDC recommendations, "low (but not zero) risk" travelers are required to report their daily health status to DPH, and the EAMS dashboard enables DPH epidemiologists to track symptoms and compliance with active monitoring. Through 31 Mar 2015, DPH monitored 1070 travelers, and 699 (65 percent) used their EAMS traveler login instead of telephone or e-mail to report their health status. Medical evaluations were performed on 30 travelers, of whom 3 were tested for Ebola. EAMS has enabled 2 epidemiologists to monitor approximately 100 travelers daily, and to rapidly respond to travelers reporting signs and symptoms of potential Ebola virus infection. Similar electronic tracking systems might be useful for other jurisdictions. -- more

10 Apr 2015 Australia (Canberra): Health worker is being treated for Ebola following a stint at a clinic in West Africa
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3033517/Health-worker-treated-Ebola-following-stint-clinic-West-Africa.html
[An ill health-care worker, recently returned from working at an Ebola treatment unit in Liberia, has been admitted to isolation at a Canberra hospital. She is considered low-risk for contracting Ebola. Test results are anticipated in 72 hours.]

[Her symptoms, fever and stomach upset, are consistent with many possible etiologies. Since she didn't treat any Ebola patients while in Africa, she is considered low risk. See next item. - Mod.LK]

8 Apr 2015 Liberia: Land owners block road to Ebola burial site
http://allafrica.com/stories/201504090797.html?viewall=1
[The only road to the special Ebola burial site was closed. Assistant Chief Elder of Giah Town, Daniel Sackor, stated the total amount for the 25-acre [10.1 ha] land was USD 50 000; the government paid USD 25 000 to them on 2 Dec 2014 and it has not yet paid the balance of USD 25 000]

[The site is being managed by Global Communities, an international non-governmental organization; but the disagreement is with the government. - Mod.LK]

10 Apr 2015 Liberia: Disposing of Ebola waste in Liberia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=nFwfoSOe3Yc
[Outbreak containment requires the safe disposal of waste. Each Ebola patient has been estimated by Occupational Health and Safety to generate 465 cubic feet of solid waste weighing over 1000 pounds, roughly 30 to 40 times more than regular hospital patients. Taken together, all of the linens, clothes, scrubs, towels, and other daily needs, as well as liquid waste due to vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding, etc., the cost of Ebola waste disposal totals about USD 1000 per barrel. This volume of waste poses a significant and hazardous challenge. - Mod.LK]

8 Apr 2015 Sierra Leone: Ebola resurfaces at Kroo Bay
http://allafrica.com/stories/201504090982.html
[There has been another confirmed Ebola case reported in Kroo Bay, a sprawling, densely populated slum community on the Atlantic coast, in the Western Area. Residents are concerned about poor sanitary conditions (there are only 6 public toilets for a population of about 10 000, and clean drinking water availability is inadequate). The home of the Ebola-infected patient is under quarantine.]

[Such flare-ups of cases may continue for some time what with such poor sanitary conditions. Investment in improving the standard of living of these communities will go a long way to improving the public health. - Mod LK]

9 Apr 2015 USA (Maryland): American treated for Ebola released from NIH Hospital
http://time.com/3816352/american-ebola-hospital-released/
[The patient was admitted to the National Institutes of Health facility on 13 Mar 2015, and discharged from NIH on Thu 9 Apr 2015 (28-day hospitalization). Patient was discharged after 2 negative tests for Ebola virus. While in Sierra Leone, patient worked as a volunteer for Partners in Health, and was one of several workers exposed to Ebola, but was the only one who contracted the disease. The others brought back to the USA were monitored and discharged. The recently discharged NIH patient is 1 of 2 patients successfully treated for Ebola at NIH; the other patient was the Dallas nurse discharged on 1 Oct 2014.]

[Before Ebola struck Liberia, Fatu Kekula was finishing her nursing degree, but that ended when the school closed. 8 months ago, she saved most of her family from Ebola by using trash bags, rubber boots, and chlorine. Now, thanks to generous donors, she attends Emory University Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing in the USA. In addition to other studies, Kekula has asked for special training on certain skills, such as caring for burns, a common type of injury because children in Liberia sometimes fall into the open fires used for cooking.]

["Summary: A recommendation for patients with Ebola in many resource-rich regions is that critical care interventions should be limited and that do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders should be instituted. The argument is that there is little evidence for the efficacy of ventilation, dialysis, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation for Ebola-related critical illness, and that they would be overly risky. On the basis of clinical experiences and the best available evidence, we disagree with this approach to the management of Ebola."]

However, a research team reviewing old documents found many studies "buried behind research paywalls," revealing there was significant evidence of antibodies to the Ebola virus in Liberia and in other nearby nations.]
