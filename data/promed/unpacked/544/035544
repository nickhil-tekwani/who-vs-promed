Dengue fever - Dominican Republic: Request for information
----------------------------------------------------------
Recently at TropNetEurop we have observed an increase in patients
presenting with Dengue fever after travel to the Dominican Republic. During
the last week, 2 patients have been reported from Berlin, and one from Leipzig.
The report from Berlin (Martin Grobusch) stated that: "Within 5 days, we
saw two returning travellers from the Dominican Republic (Punta Cana/Bavaro
Beach Area) with Dengue fever. The first is a 15 year old boy (presenting
on 15 Aug 2000), who fell ill 10 days after a fortnight's holiday at Bavaro
Beach with malaise, fatigue, headaches, severe musculoskeletal pain, a
faint exanthema and fever. Malaria was excluded, but a Dengue IgM rapid
immunochromatographic test was positive for IgM. So far, he is making an
uneventful recovery. The second is a 35 year old woman (presenting on 19
Aug 2000), who fell ill 3 days after a fortnight's holiday at Bavaro Beach.
For 5 days, she ran a high fever accompanied by malaise, fatigue,
headaches, and musculoskeletal pain. Malaria was excluded on first
presentation, and a Dengue IgM rapid immunochromatographic test was
positive. Today, she is presenting again with a developing rash."
The report from Leipzig (Marco Schulze) describes a 21 year old female
German patient, who presented on 30 Jul 2000, with fever, rash, headache,
myalgia, and meningeal signs after travel to the Dominican Republic (26 Jun
2000 - 25 Jul 2000). Diagnosis was confirmed by serology.
We are not sure whether these recent occurrences are co-incidental or
whether they actually signal an increased risk to travellers. However, at
the beginning of the European travel season to the Dominican Republic,
there should be increased awareness of the current situation in clinics
dealing with febrile returnees from this region.
