A 28-year-old woman with leptospirosis is in the intensive care unit at the City Hospital in Mykolaiv. This is the 2nd patient with leptospirosis to be admitted to the City Hospital No. 5 in 2020. The 1st was a 52-year-old man who was treated from [24 Jul 2020] and discharged with recovery on [7 Aug 2020].

In total in the Nikolaev [Mykolaiv] area since the beginning of the year, 6 cases of leptospirosis are recorded.

Leptospirosis is an acute infectious disease that is transmitted through food (through water and food, by contact (when bathing in water, various types of agricultural work, in case of bites by sick animals, damage to the skin by infected objects), and aspiration (during haymaking and agricultural products), which causes the peak of infections in August-September. [Leptospirosis can be transmitted to humans by contact, especially when the skin is broken from a cut or scratch, with water or soil contaminated with the urine (not saliva, such as via animal bites) of infected animals. Drinking contaminated water or eating contaminated food can also cause leptospirosis. I am unsure what is meant by "aspiration (during haymaking and agricultural products)." Seasonal outbreaks of leptospirosis usually follow exposure to contaminated fresh water flooding during periods of heavy rainfall. - Mod.ML]

To avoid leptospirosis, you need to follow a number of simple and at the same time necessary rules:
- It is necessary to bathe in specially allotted places. Leptospirosis infection is more common in closed bodies of water, especially in shallow water, where there is a lot of vegetation. Keep in mind that the risk of infection increases when bathing if there are scratches or wounds, and swallowing water.
- It is advisable to refrain from walking barefoot in wetlands.
- In fieldwork, fishing, hunting, caring for sick cattle, it is necessary to follow the rules of personal hygiene, wear rubber or tarpaulin boots, gloves.
- It is forbidden to use raw water from open reservoirs.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that is distributed widely throughout the world. Although leptospirosis is more common in tropical areas, it is also found in temperate areas. It is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or fresh (not salty) water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. These animals are mostly asymptomatic but chronically infected with one of the several hundred serovars of the spirochete _Leptospira interrogans_.

Many species of wild and domestic animals (including rodents, dogs, cattle, swine, and perhaps river otters) are susceptible to chronic urinary tract infection with _Leptospira_. In these animals, leptospiruria persists for long periods or for life, and _Leptospira_ bacteria shed in urine may survive in fresh water or moist soil for weeks to months.

Leptospirosis is an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors or with animals; for example, workers in wet agricultural settings (such as rice field workers), ranchers, slaughterhouse workers, trappers, loggers, sewer workers, veterinarians, fishery workers, dairy farmers, or military personnel. Leptospirosis is also a risk from household exposure to infected pet animals or rodents.

Leptospirosis is a risk during recreational activities such as camping, fresh water swimming, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, golfing, and trail biking that involve exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or ponds contaminated by urine from _Leptospira_-infected animals.

Outbreaks frequently follow heavy rainfalls, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.

Conditions favoring rat infestation in urban settings include older housing in poor repair that permits access to food and harborage for rats, inadequate disposal of trash and debris; lumber and firewood piles not stacked off the ground; abandoned automobiles and appliances; dilapidated outbuildings; inadequately maintained sewer systems; and parks, subways, railroad lines, and highways that can provide a suitable habitat.

The news release does not state how the diagnosis of leptospirosis was made in the cases. Because the clinical manifestations of leptospirosis can be non-specific, laboratory confirmation is necessary. The _Leptospira_ Dip-S-Tick (DST) IgM dot-ELISA test kits (PanBio Integrated Diagnostics) can provide in-the-field testing of suspected patients (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC149700/). Confirmatory testing uses the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Molecular assays such as DNA PCR can also be used, if available.

Nikolaev, also known as Mykolaiv, with a population of 494 763 residents (2015), is a city in southern Ukraine, the administrative center of the Nikolaev Oblast; Mykolaiv is said to be the main shipbuilding center of the Black Sea (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mykolaiv).
