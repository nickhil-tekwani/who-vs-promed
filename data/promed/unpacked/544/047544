Despite the concerns expressed by Queensland's beekeepers regarding the possible restrictions imposed due to the recent varroa mite infestation in the port of Townsville, Biosecurity Queensland reassures that the outbreak can be eliminated and there are no plans to expand the 10 kilometer [6.2 mi] control zone around the port. There have been no detections of the parasites since the discovery of 2 mites in an Asian honeybee hive last week [4-10 Jul 2016].

"Based on our understanding of the movements of the Asian honey bee and based on how long we believe the hive was there, we believe 10 km [6.2 mi] is sufficient to cover the area the bees could have moved in that time," says Ashley Bunce, director of the varroa mite response from Biosecurity Queensland. "Should that change in the future, then of course we'll need to re-assess the situation."

ABC reports that Bunce met with 70 beekeepers at a briefing in Townsville and told them that they have nothing to worry about. Australian Honeybee Industry Council executive director Trevor Weatherhead and others say they are satisfied with how authorities handled the problem.

However, some people are still frustrated and believe that abandoning the national eradication program, which involved eradicating _Apis cerana_ or Asian honey bee, exposed the beekeeping industry to this varroa mite outbreak. According to Robert Dewar, the president of the Queensland Beekeepers' Association, they tried their best to continue the program but there were not enough funds as other states decided killing off the Asian honey bee is not practical.

Dewar asserts that the Asian honey bee population is not that widespread across Australia. The bee species only resides in Cairns so eradicating them would not cause a huge impact.

Still, Bunce says that reintroducing the eradication program is not possible. Bunce adds that response to this outbreak should primarily focus on the parasites, not on the unaffected bees.

[_Varroa jacobsoni_ was a mite maintained by Asian honey bee (_Apis cerana_), while _V. destructor_ successfully reproduces in both _A. cerana_ and _A. mellifera_ colonies.

_Apis cerana_ is endemic to most of Asia, where it has been used for honey production and pollination services for thousands of years. Since the 1980s, _A. cerana_ has been introduced to areas outside its natural range (including Australia), which sparked fears that it may become a pest species that could compete with, and negatively affect, native Australian fauna and flora, as well as commercially kept _A. mellifera_ and commercial crops. Being the natural hosts of _V. jacobsoni_ supposes an additional reason to control _A. cercana_ in Australia.

The Biosecurity Queensland Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF)'s Asian honeybee program has been in place to control _A. cerana_ in Queensland since its 1st incursion into Cairns in 2007. Various surveillance and destruction methods were trialled by Biosecurity Queensland DAFF in the past with varying success.
