Caution must be exercised when recommending antibiotics for meningitis,
especially in children. Intravenous penicillin is the drug of choice for the
meningococcus; the pneumococcus however is becoming increasingly resistant
to penicillin and ampicillin as well as other drugs (this resistance is not
beta-lactamase mediated).
This resistance was initially seen in South Africa, Hungary and Spain, but
has already been reported from all continents. Some cities and areas of the
U.S. have high levels of penicillin resistant pneumococcus (PRP). There is
no consensus as to the ideal initial antibiotic choice for pneumococcal
meningitis or bacterial meningitis of undetermined cause in areas where PRP
prevalence is significant. Vancomycin has been a choice with U.S.
pediatricians. Ceftriaxone can be used, at least with relative resistance;
a sensitive strain is one susceptible to less than 0.1 mcg/ml, relative
resistant is a strain resistant to concentrations of 0.1 to 1.0 mcg/ml but
sensitive to more, resistant is a strain resistant to concentrations of 1.0
mcg/ml or more -- as diffusion of ceftriaxone to the central nervous system
(CNS) is much better than for penicillin or ampicillin. This latter drug is
no longer the initial choice in bacterial meningitis.
There is no doubt that this places a considerable burden, financial and
medical, on
the treatment of meningitis, mainly in developing countries. Efficacious
conjugate vaccines for meningococcus and pneumococcus are being developed,
but still are some way off.

For the discussion on the control of meningococcal disease, the
Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, which inter
alia advises on public health policy, has recently published:
National Health and Medical Research Council (Series on Infectious
Disease Control), Guidelines for the control of meningococcal disease in
Australia, October 1996, Canberra, Australian Government Publishing
Service.
It is available from:
The Publications Officer
National Health and Medical Research Council
Mail Drop Point 50
GPO box 9848
Canberra A.C.T. 2601
AUSTRALIA
While designed for local conditions, it should be useful to communicable
disease control staff in other industrialized countries.
