The number of dengue deaths has risen to 180 while 18 030 cases have
been reported in Sri Lanka so far, officials from the Epidemiology
Unit of the Health Ministry said on Saturday [18 Jul 2009]. They said
of the 18 030 cases the highest number of patients was reported from
June [2009] totaling 7005. This represents a sharp increase as 4156
dengue cases and 85 deaths were reported for the whole year of 2008.

Government officials said dengue virus has hit the countrywide this
year [2009] affecting mostly the youth, many of them students.

The rapid rise in the level of the epidemic has forced the health
authorities to carry out an extensive public awareness campaign to
eradicate the mosquito based epidemic. Households have been warned to
keep the environment free of mosquitoes. Those who allow the
mosquitoes to breed by allowing stagnating water face prosecution
with a special hotline being made available for public information.

Children die of dengue in north-western Burma [Myanmar]
-------------------------------------------------------
At least 10 children have died and several are ill after being
afflicted by dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease, in Kalemyo a
town near the Indo-Burma [Myanmar] border in Sagaing Division,
north-western Burma [Myanmar], an official at a private clinic said.

"As far as I know at least 10 children have died. A lot of other
children are admitted in the hospital, which is crowded with
patients," the official in Thapyaynyo clinic in Kalemyo said.

When contacted, an official at the Kalemyo General Hospital on Friday
[17 Jul 2009] said, the 'Patient Ward' of the hospital is full of
children being treated for dengue haemorrhagic fever [DHF].

The outbreak of dengue was noticed in Kalemyo in the beginning of
June [2009] and has been continuing since.

A local resident of Kalemyo told Mizzima that most of the children in
her neighborhood are suffering from the disease. While many have been
taken to hospital several others are depending on private clinics.

Dengue in Kalemyo, a town located on the border of Chin state in
western Burma [Myanmar], is common during the monsoons.

Local residents said, despite being curable diseases, malaria and
typhoid continue to claim several lives every year.

[Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that causes a severe
flu-like illness, and sometimes develops into a potentially lethal
complication called dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF). Dengue virus is
transmitted by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito. There are 4 distinct
viruses that cause dengue. In Asia, 2-5 year dengue/DHF epidemic
cycles are established in southern Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Laos,
Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam. There is
no specific treatment and so far no vaccine to protect against
dengue. At present, the only method of controlling or preventing
dengue virus transmission is to combat the vector mosquitoes, see
<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs117/en/>.

Although there were dengue/DHF outbreaks reported in Viet Nam,
Cambodia, and Thailand, the newswire above is the 1st reported dengue
outbreak in Myanmar during 2009. The last dengue fever outbreak in
Myanmar was reported in Monywa after the cyclone in 2008 (see prior
PRO/MBDS posting Post cyclone situation - Myanmar (05): dengue
20080730.2321).
