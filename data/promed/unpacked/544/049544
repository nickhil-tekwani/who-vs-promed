[According to figures released on Tuesday [12 May 2015] by the special government department set up to fight the disease, treatment clinics were handling just 8 confirmed Ebola cases. According to Fode Tass Sylla, special government department spokesperson: "Today we have 27 sick in our treatment centers, including 18 confirmed cases. Yesterday alone we recorded 5 sick." He also said all the new patients had contracted Ebola virus disease at funeral ceremonies.]

Ebola tied to changing eye color
--------------------------------
How can a viral infection change the color of a person's eye?

Months after [a US doctor] thought he had recovered from Ebola, he was stunned to find himself developing intense eye pain and fading vision. The inside of his left eye was still occupied territory, full of live, replicating virus. And one morning during this siege, he saw that his iris had changed from blue to green.

Although such color changes are rare, they do occur from time to time during viral infections, eye doctors say. The changes in hue are almost always permanent.

But in [this] case, his eye color went back to normal as he recovered. Why only one eye was affected and how the changes happened are mysteries. "I've been doing what I do for 40 years, and I've never seen such a reversibility," said Dr. C. Stephen Foster, a clinical professor of ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School and the chief executive officer of the Massachusetts Eye Research and Surgery Institution.
