Spring rains in the Front Range, after years of drought, are leading
to thriving populations of mice and other rodents -- carrying the
rare, sometimes deadly diseases of plague, tularemia, and hantavirus.
"It certainly has been a good year, so far for, the rodent diseases,"
said state epidemiologist John Pape.
A man in Weld County is recovering from hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome, officials said Wednesday [23 May 2007]. An Alamosa County
woman died of the same respiratory disease -- spread by infected mice
-- earlier this month [May 2007].
Plague killed a capuchin monkey at the Denver Zoo last week [14-20
May 2007], after 20 cases were discovered in tree squirrels in the
City Park area.
The bacterial disease kills about 18 people annually in the United States.
This spring, at least 2 cats in southwestern Colorado have tested
positive for tularemia.
When the tularemia bacteria affect humans, it is known as "rabbit
fever." About 200 people come down with the fever each year.
"In wet years, we have lots of vegetation and explosive population
booms in rodents," Pape said. "The more dense they are, the better
they transmit disease."
Plague is caused by _Yersinia pestis_ -- a form of the bacteria that
killed an estimated 25 million people in Europe during the Middle
Ages. It is rare today, but about 1 in 7 people infected dies because
the disease is not caught early enough. Humans usually get plague
from infected fleas, which pick it up from squirrels, prairie dogs,
and other rodents, Pape said.
Plague is always simmering in Colorado's rodent populations, Pape
said, but the disease boils up into an outbreak every 5 to 10 years,
sometimes killing off whole colonies of prairie dogs. It's usually
during those years that the human cases occur, he added.
[Last week (14-20 May 2007) in Weld County, a 30-year-old man turned
up with hantavirus, another rodent-related disease. The source of the
infection has not been determined, said county spokeswoman Gaye
Morrison. It is usually caught when a person inhales dust
contaminated with mouse urine or feces, or through direct contact with mice.
Early last spring [2006], health experts discovered plague at several
Front Range locations and feared the disease might take off, Pape
said. "Then it was hot for 6 weeks and that absolutely shut it off,"
Pape said. "During long, hot, dry periods, fleas literally dry up and die."
Southwestern Colorado stayed relatively cool last spring [2006] and
all 4 of Colorado's human plague cases showed up in the region, said
Joe Fowler, a registered nurse and epidemiologist for the San Juan
Basin Health Department. [A 13-year-old girl] who lives outside
Durango, said she spent a miserable 4 days in Mercy Hospital with
plague last summer [2006], feverish and vomiting.
This year, Fowler said, 2 cats in the southwest suspected to have
plague turned up positive for tularemia. In people, tularemia
bacteria can trigger a wide variety of symptoms, from skin ulcers to
diarrhea, to fever, depending on whether it is inhaled, ingested, or
caught from an infected tick or deerfly. "We do have lots of growth,
so humans are encroaching on areas where rodents carrying plague
live," Fowler said.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Joseph P. Dudley, Ph.D
[Although this article mentions reasons for the increase in
rodentborne diseases, the focus is that this is the 1st article that
has reported tularemia in cats. The causative agent for Tularemia is
_Francisella tularensis_.
_Francisella tularensis_, a gram-negative pleomorphic bacterium, is
the causative agent of tularemia. This infectious disease was 1st
described in Japan in 1837. The name of the disease is related to a
1911 description of a plague-like illness in ground squirrels in
Tulare County, California, and work done by Dr. Edward Francis. Dr.
Francis described his personal experience with more than 800 cases in
1928. The causative agent is found in more than 100 species of wild
animals, including birds and insects, worldwide. The most virulent of
the 4 known strains is found in primarily in North America. The
strains appear to vary in both virulence and geographical range.
The route of transmission and factors relating to the host and the
organism influence the presentation. The organism produces an acute
febrile illness in humans
Cats may display lethargy, and some relatively non-specific
respiratory difficulty. Cats may be at increased risk because of
their predatory nature with rodents.
Streptomycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and tetracyclines are
effective at recommended dose levels; however, tetracycline and
chloramphenicol have been associated with relapses in people. Early
treatment should prevent death. Control is difficult and is limited
to reducing tick infestation and to rapid diagnosis and treatment.
Prolonged treatment may be necessary because many organisms are
intracellular. Use of a vaccine previously available for people at
high risk of infection (such as, laboratory personnel) is currently
under review. Recovery confers long-lasting immunity.
