World's oddest creature at risk from killer fungus
-----------------------------------------------
It is a unique Australian creature, a mammal that lays eggs and has a
furry body, a bill like a duck's and webbed feet. The males are also
poisonous. But in Tasmania, one of its principal habitats, the
platypus is under threat from a deadly fungal disease.
More than 1/3rd of the population is believed to have been wiped out
in the north of the island state, and there are reports that the
disease has now spread to southern areas. It is almost always fatal,
causing ulcers that turn into gaping wounds.
The shy, solitary platypus inhabits the waterways of Tasmania and the
eastern Australian mainland. The same fungus is found on the
mainland, where it kills amphibians, particularly Queensland's green
tree frogs. But it does not affect platypuses there.
Niall Stewart, a research fellow at the University of Tasmania,
believes that the tiny frogs may have carried the fungus into
Tasmania in bunches of Queensland bananas. "Platypuses on the
mainland have evolved with the fungus, and so they're immune," he
said. "But the poor platypuses here haven't seen it before." The
island is a haven for platypuses, thanks to its abundant waterways.
But Dr. Stewart, who has carried out extensive field work, believes
that 35 percent are falling victim to the disease in the affected areas.
Dr. Stewart said nothing was being done to combat the disease. He has
repeatedly failed to secure research funding. The problem has been
overshadowed by a rare cancer that has killed half of the wild
population of another native animal, the Tasmanian devil, and
threatens the species' survival.
The ulcers, which appear on a platypus's broad tail or hips, grow to
up to 10 cm in diameter. Death is usually caused by secondary
bacterial infections or from depletion of body fat, most of which is
stored in the tail. The wounds also prevent the platypus from keeping
warm in cold water.
It is not known how the disease is transmitted, possibly by ticks, or
by males fighting, or via burrows. Dr. Stewart said it was feasible
that mud containing fungal spores was being carried into new areas on
hikers' boots or on 4x4 vehicles.
Asked whether the Tasmanian platypus could develop immunity, he
replied: "Possibly, in a few hundred thousand years. The problem is
that mature animals with ulcers are still capable of breeding, so
they're producing more susceptible animals. It would take a long time
for natural selection to sort it out." The platypus is one of only 3
monotremes -- egg-laying mammals -- in the world. The others are
Australia's 2 species of echidna, or spiny anteater.

[Although the current platypus is still breeding susceptible
offspring, why not cross breed them with the non-susceptible animals
from the mainland? Clearly, more research, with a rapid breakthrough
for treatment or resistance, is needed.
This species is sometimes called the duck-billed platypus. The male,
especially, is quite strong, being capable of injuring a small dog,
and certainly inflicting pain on a human. Also, as this article
mentions, there are poisonous spurs on the hind legs. They are
generally freshwater dwellers, well equipped for swimming, having webbed feet.
