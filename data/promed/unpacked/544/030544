FOODBORNE DISEASES REVIEW
*************************
A ProMED-mail post
Date: Tue, 30 Sep 1997 21:50:07 +2700
From: Edward Schroder <schroder@usa.healthnet.org>
Today at the 37th Interscience Congress on Antimicrobial Agents and
Chemotherapy (ICAAC), Toronto, Canada, Dr. David Swerdlow of CDC, Atlanta
presented a talk entitled "Foodborne Diseases in the Global Village"
Dr. Swerdlow described several US outbreaks of foodborne illness to
illustrate the impact of globalization of the food supply on this emerging
problem in human health. Examples cited included several outbreaks of
Salmonella infection, E. coli 0157, and Cyclospora.
Salmonella enteriditis, phage type 4 is a worldwide problem, and in recent
years has been associated with disease in the southwestern US. Eggs have
ben implicated as a food source in many outbreaks, but other foods have
also been involved. Dr Swerdlow referred to this organism as the cause of
an ongoing pandemic.
Salmonella typhimurium, phage type DT104 disease has been increasing in
incidence, especially in the United Kingdom, in fact it has become the
second most common isolate in human cases of foodborne disease in the UK.
The organism responsible typically expresses several antibiotic resistance
genes. Increasing incidence of fluoroquinolone resistance is particularly
worrisome according to Swerdlow. He noted that the US Food and Drug
Administration has approved limited use of fluoroquinolones in poultry
production, and questions the wisdom of this decision. Dr. Swerdlow
pointed out, however, that elderly or immunocompromised hosts are at
greater risk of developing septic complications, and may require
antimicrobial therapy.
Dr. Swerdlow emphasized that "It is now possible to produce a food product
anywhere, process it for distribution anywhere for consumption anywhere."
Thus, we can expect increasing numbers of outbreaks caused by organisms
that were previously restricted to areas of endemicity. During the
discussion session, it was pointed out that global trade agreements often
make it impossible for agencies in recipient countries to monitor
production and processing practices.
