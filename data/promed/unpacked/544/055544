Salmonellosis on a cruise ship traveling from Germany around the UK
---------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of gastrointestinal disease on board a cruise ship
sailing around Britain is currently being investigated [1]. The MV
Mona Lisa left Bremerhaven, northern Germany, on 28 Aug 2004 carrying
940 people (330 crew and 610 passengers). Most of the passengers were
German.
Following a welcome dinner that day, 86 people developed
gastrointestinal illness over the following 4 days (29 Aug: 1 case;
30 Aug: 25 cases; 31 Aug: 45 cases; 1 Sep: 15 cases). The attack
rates among passengers and crew are reported to be similar, although
dates of onset among crew members were mostly 1 day later than among
passengers.
Diarrhea was reported much more often than vomiting, and 2 patients
were admitted to hospital when the ship arrived in the Orkney
Islands, off the coast of north Scotland. So far, 16 cases have been
microbiologically confirmed as salmonellosis. A Scottish outbreak
control team is trying to determine whether a food served at the
welcome dinner was the source. The ship docked in Dover, England, on
7 Sep 2004 and questionnaires were collected from passengers and crew.
The Scottish Salmonella Reference Laboratory has confirmed that a
number of the isolates are _Salmonella_ Enteritidis phage type 4.
Since 2 Sep 2004, 26 more people have become ill with
gastrointestinal disease. No pathogen has yet been isolated from
these patients. 17 patients still have symptoms. This 2nd wave of
cases raises the possibility of a continuing common source of
infection, or secondary spread of _Salmonella_, or a concurrent
outbreak involving another pathogen (such as norovirus). The
investigation continues with the full cooperation of the ship's
staff. The ship is due back in Bremerhaven on 9 Sep 2004.

_Salmonella enterica_ serotype Enteritidis phage type 4 is now one of
the commonest salmonella causing infections in England and Wales.
During 1994, 45 percent of all salmonella infections and about 1/2 of
all outbreaks of salmonellosis were due to this bacterium. It is
still overwhelmingly associated with poultry and eggs.
Interestingly, the phage type appears to be more stable in the
environment than other salmonellae (see Humphrey TJ, Slater E,
McAlpine K, et al: Salmonella enteritidis phage type 4 isolates more
tolerant of heat, acid, or hydrogen peroxide also survive longer on
surfaces. Appl Environ Microbiol 1995; 61:3161-64). - Mod.LL]
