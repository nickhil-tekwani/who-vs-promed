According to the Center of the state sanitary epidemiological service
of Bishkek, as of 8 Aug 2007, 52 cases of a malaria, including 29 in
residents and 23 in visitors, have been registered in Bishkek, the
capital of Kyrgyzstan. Four persons are in the Republican infectious
diseases hospital, and 48 have already completed treatment.
The majority of the patients are inhabitants of new residential areas
of Bosogo, Olmo and Kalys-Ordo, located close to the water reservoir
(Archunsky) of the Chuysky region. Since 2005, the reservoir has been
a known breeding place for malaria mosquitoes.
From the middle of August 2007, the state sanitary epidemiological
service of Bishkek plans to release Gambuzia fish, which eat the
nymphs of insect, in all ponds of the city and its suburbs.

[Despite 52 cases of malaria this year (2007) in Bishkek, the
situation can be considered stable. For the last 17 days (from 24 Jul
to 10 Aug 2007), the increase in the number of cases was 3 persons,
whereas from 11-24 Jul 2007, it was 10 persons, and from 10 May-10
Jul 2007, it was 34 persons.
Thus, the increase of malaria cases in Bishkek took place in May-June
2007 and is now decreasing. All cases were "3-day malaria"
[_Plasmodium vivax_]. For comparison, in 2006, 330 cases of malaria,
including 125 cases in Bishkek, were registered in Kyrgyzstan, and
the country should be considered endemic for malaria.
Since 2002, morbidity due to malaria in Kyrgyzstan has decreased from
more than 3000 cases down to the present level. Up to 2002, malaria
increased for the previous 15-20 years, probably due to migrants from
Afghanistan and Tajikistan. The decrease in malaria in Kyrgyzstan is
primarily due to the control program, "Control of malaria over
Kyrgyzstan," supported by the Global Fund for the Fight Against AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria. However, the Osh, Batken, Jalalabad regions
and Bishkek still remain endemic areas; see (in Russian):
