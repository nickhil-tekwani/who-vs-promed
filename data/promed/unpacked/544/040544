[Since 11 Dec 2015 the number of cases worldwide in the WHO database has fluctuated between 28 601 and 28 604 due to revisions, while the number of deaths remained static at 11 300. The 18 Dec 2015 case total for the 3 countries is 28 601 as of 16 Dec 2015, including the deaths -- but many of those cases and deaths were not laboratory confirmed. - Mod.JW]

The WHO clinical case definition for suspected cases of Ebola virus disease arriving at Ebola holding units: reason to worry?

[Excerpts]
[T]he specificity of the WHO case definition was strikingly low at 31.5 percent (95 percent CI 26â€¢0-37.6). This implies that 68 percent of patients who would be selected for admission to a holding unit would not actually have Ebola virus disease (false-positive results) -- indeed, a toss of a coin might have yielded a better chance of an accurate result. The clinical features of severe malaria, typhoid fever, and gastroenteritis can all mimic Ebola virus disease, all are probably prevalent in endemic areas, and many of those admitted to Ebola holding units are likely to have 1 of these illnesses. What is worrisome is that such patients who did not have Ebola virus disease would have been placed at high risk of exposure to Ebola virus within the holding unit, with this risk being commensurate with time spent in the unit waiting for the laboratory result. In Lado and colleagues' study, the median time for a laboratory result (in this case a semiquantitative Ebola virus reverse-transcriptase PCR) was 2 days (IQR 1-3), and interestingly 126 (15 percent) of the 850 admitted patients had no recorded result...
Operationally, if individuals are to be sent to hospital wards after being screened for Ebola virus disease, there must be absolute confidence that they do not have the disease (which needs maximum diagnostic sensitivity). Conversely, if people are being screened for admission to Ebola holding units with mediocre levels of infection control, there must be absolute confidence that they do have Ebola virus disease (necessitating maximum diagnostic specificity). The availability of such a test will be crucial in future Ebola outbreaks.

[Excerpts:

"... supplementary diagnostics tests, in addition to viremia quantification by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), may be needed to confirm the elimination of EBOV in convalescent survivors. Heightened awareness regarding the possibility of recovering survivors harbouring live EBOV is necessary, but due to the lower amounts of virus present with-in convalescent patients compared to those with advanced EBOV disease, it is unlikely that survivors play a major role with regards to EBOV propagation in humans.

... the evidence at hand does not support the virus becoming endemic amongst the human population, and current response measures, which have steadily lowered the number of new weekly infections over time, should be sufficient in eventually ending the prolonged EBOV outbreak in Western Africa. However, the existence of possible "super-spreaders" of disease (Wong et al., 2015), and the relapse of Scottish nurse to EBOV disease is a reminder that close surveil-lance for any potential reoccurrence of EBOV disease in the human population is needed."]

[Has any reader seen a report that the relapsed Scottish nurse was excreting infectious virus? I haven`t -- her doctors were just taking precautions in case that should occur. - Mod.JW]

Epidemiology
--------
17 Dec 2015 Liberia: Female survivor may be cause of Ebola flare-up in Liberia
http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-ebola-liberia-idUKKBN0U02EJ20151217?rpc=401
[According to experts investigating the case, an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Liberia months after the country was declared free of the virus could have stemmed from a survivor ("OG"), the mother of "NG," the index case of the latest Liberian outbreak (November 2015). "OG" (who is still alive) may have become infectious again after her immune system was weakened by pregnancy. A main hypothesis for the new cases is OG's "recrudescence", meaning a surge in virus replication from a dormant state, thought to be linked to a weakened immune system.

According to this theory, "OG" caught Ebola more than a year ago from her brother who died of a presumed Ebola infection in July 2014. She is then believed to have recovered, but the virus flared up again this year while she was pregnant. Antibodies fighting the virus tend to drop towards delivery.

It is not known exactly how she might have transmitted the virus, which is found in body fluids, to her family. According to experts, the theory means there can be no let-up in the monitoring of survivors for months or even years to come. According to Jonathan Heeney, Professor of Comparative Pathology at Cambridge, who has written about human reservoirs of the virus, "The affected countries want to say they are Ebola-free but they need help with continuing surveillance and health care monitoring. If you turn your back on this, you will see more of these cases."

The sources say another possible explanation is a secret sexual relationship between a family member and another survivor, although interviews have so far yielded few clues.]

18 Dec 2015 Liberia: UNHCR and Liberia resume repatriation of Ivorians after Ebola hiatus
http://allafrica.com/stories/201512181422.html
[On 18 Dec 2015, the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) and Liberia resumed the voluntary repatriation of 10s of 1000s of Ivorian refugees, held in camps, from Liberia. The returns had been interrupted for more than 1 year by the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak. Approximately 11 000 of the 38 000 Ivorian refugees in Liberian camps have said they wish to return immediately. Convoys have begun taking refugees to Cote d'Ivoire. Did not a single one of them get EVD? - Mod.JW]

18 Dec 2015: Ebola vaccination
http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2901243-X/abstract

Citation. Fitzgerald F, Yeung S, Gibb D. (19 Dec 2015) Ebola vaccination. _The Lancet, Volume 386, No. 10012,_p2478. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(15)01243-X

We welcome the results from the _Ebola ca Suffit_("Ebola that is enough") trial, emphasising the potential importance of a vaccine in controlling Ebola virus disease. However, parallel development in children and adolescents is scarce. More than 3000 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease in children younger than 14 years have been reported, including cases documented in the trial, which might have been prevented if these children had been vaccinated.

Phase 1/2 safety data in children are urgently needed for candidate vaccines, and could be incorporated into ongoing trials. Only 1 paediatric trial is registered (NCT02509494). Although the first Ebola vaccines in human beings were appropriately done in adults, subsequent over-cautious paediatric development plans risk vaccine protection being denied to more than 40 percent of the population in affected regions. Experience with adenovirus and modified vaccinia Ankara virus vectors in children is extensive with a favourable safety profile. In view of the high fatality rates for Ebola virus disease in young children, the potential benefit of vaccination and scarcity of previous safety signals, active development is appropriate and necessary...
