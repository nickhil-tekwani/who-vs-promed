Ground beef recalled due to possible _E. coli_ contamination
----------------------------------------------------------
The Agriculture Department said Saturday that Emmpack Foods Inc. of
Milwaukee, WI is recalling 471 000 pounds of ground beef because of
possible contamination by potentially deadly _E. coli_ O157:H7 bacteria.
The meat was produced on 6 Mar 2001 and distributed nationwide for retail
use in 5-pound tubes and for institutional purposes in boxes weighing
between 5 and 20 pounds. Both products bear a sell-by date of 3-22-01 and
bear the establishment number 20654 inside the USDA seal of inspection. The
retail product is identified as "Manufactured by Peck Meat Packing."
