3 more cases of anthrax have been reported at Morgenster in Masvingo
district, taking the cumulative total of anthrax cases in humans to 283 in
the province. Masvingo district is the latest casualty of anthrax, which
has wreaked havoc in Gutu, Chivi, and Bikita districts since September 2003.
Acting provincial medical director for Masvingo Mr Edwin Sithole confirmed
that new cases of anthrax had been reported in the province. "We have just
received new reports of cases in the Morgenster area, and we have already
deployed our teams. So far we have 3 cases, though there have been no death
reports as yet, but the number of cases could be higher," said Dr Sithole.
He said they had tightened their surveillance on the movement of beef in
the affected areas and were working with the Veterinary Department and the
Civil Protection Unit to curb the spread of anthrax. "The situation had
been a bit quiet in the other districts that had been affected before, but
we are keeping a close eye on the development. Meetings are being regularly
held with other stakeholders to contain the spread of the disease," Dr
Sithole added.
He said most people were contracting the disease after eating beef from
infected cattle, and he encouraged them to have their beef inspected first
before consuming.
The first cases of anthrax in Masvingo were reported in September 2003, and
so far Bikita has the highest number, with 147 cases having been reported
in Ngorima, Mutikizizi, and Devure. In Gutu district, a total of 82 cases,
including 2 deaths, were reported, while in Chivi 51 cases and deaths were
reported.
Efforts to get a comment from the veterinary office regarding the impact
of anthrax on cattle were fruitless. However, reports indicate that the
disease has claimed many cattle, especially in Bikita district, dealing a
heavy blow to the province's efforts to rebuild its herd.

[This is turning into yet another disaster for Zimbabwe. Just over 20
years ago they had 10 000 human cases when disease control had been
significantly weakened by their civil war. With the ongoing lawlessness and
fragile infrastructure, this may become a repeat of those events. It is
highly probable that the true incidence of human cases in rural areas is
already a multiple of the reported number. In normal circumstances this
would have been controlled and prevented from the start by proper livestock
vaccination. - Mod.MHJ]
