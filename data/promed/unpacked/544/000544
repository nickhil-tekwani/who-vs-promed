Around 4800 pigs killed because of brucellosis in Mecklenburg
-------------------------------------------------------------
On an organic pig farm, in the Ludwigslust district [in the southwest
of the north German state of Mecklenburg/Western Pomerania. - Mod.
AS], the entire pig population had to be killed following an outbreak
of brucellosis. The news was published by the paper "Schweriner
Volkszeitung" (Sat 13 Sep 2008).

How the disease got onto the farm with locations in Bickhusen and
Nostorf is not known. There is no danger to humans [see commentary].
The disease was detected during routine checks in early August
[2008]. 400 breeding pigs were immediately killed and removed, the
remaining 4400 pigs were kept until reaching the minimum weight of 15
kg (33 lb) and were then slaughtered and processed.

Different variants of brucellosis affect cattle, pigs, or sheep.
According to the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute, 5 outbreaks of
brucellosis have been detected, thus far during 2008, on livestock
farms in Germany.

The Veterinary authorities consider that the most likely route of
transmission was by wildlife -- especially wild boar. Therefore,
free-range animals are particularly affected by the disease.

[According to Germany's report covering January-June 2008, the last
year of brucellosis occurrence in cattle, sheep/goats, and pigs was,
respectively, as follows: _Brucella abortus_ (bovine brucellosis)
2004; _B. melitensis_ (ovine/caprine brucellosis) 2006; and _B. suis_
(porcine brucellosis) 2006. All 3 OIE (World Organisation for Animal
health)-listed zoonotic pathogens are reportable in Germany.

The main clinical manifestation of brucellosis in animals is abortion.

The following data on the disease in humans are derived from Mod.
LL's commentary in ProMED-mail posting 20040401.0883:

Among the 4 species known to cause disease in humans, _B. melitensis_
(from goats, sheep, or camels) may be the most virulent, producing
the most severe and acute cases of brucellosis with disabling
complications. A prolonged course of illness, which may be associated
with suppurative destructive lesions, is associated with _B. suis_
(from feral or commercially raised pigs) infection. _B. abortus_
(from cattle, buffalo, and camels) is associated with
mild-to-moderate sporadic disease that is rarely associated with
complications. _B. canis_ has a disease course that is
indistinguishable from _B. abortus_ infection.

Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, translated as Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania,
is a state in northern Germany, comprising 2 parts, Mecklenburg and
Vorpommern. See map at

Ludwigslust is a district in the said state; see map at
<http://www.answers.com/topic/mecklenburg-wp-lwl-png-1>.

The significant infection rate of wild boars in Mecklenburg-Western
Pomerania was demonstrated by a large-scale survey. A total of 763
sera of wild boars were tested, of which 22 percent reacted to
brucellosis. The authors (see reference below) concluded that the
high seroprevalence of brucellosis (as well as of tularemia) in wild
boars indicated that natural foci of these zoonoses were present in
wildlife in Germany. They also stated that "the impact of
transmission of zoonotic pathogens from wildlife to livestock is
unknown." The current outbreak may shed some light on this aspect of
wildlife infection.

December 2005; 52(10): 444-55 (abstract available at
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16364020>).

It will be interesting to obtain information about the method of
diagnosis applied in the described case, which, reportedly, was not
preceded by clinical suspicions (namely abortions). Was the
serological evidence followed by culture?

Since _B. suis_ is pathogenic to humans, the statement "there is no
danger to humans" is in need of clarification or reconsideration. - Mod.AS]
