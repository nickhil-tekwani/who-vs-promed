Raspberry virus may thwart itself
---------------------------------
Scientists with ARS in Corvallis, [OR], and Agritope, Inc., in Portland, are
genetically modifying the [Meeker cultivar] of raspberry (_Rubus idaeus_),
the most popular variety grown in the Pacific Northwest, to give plants
resistance [to raspberry bushy dwarf virus, RBDV]. [Infected] raspberries
develop small, crumbly fruit that is unsuitable for use as whole berries.
The infection spreads rapidly through a [crop], and growers must frequently
remove [infected] plants, fumigate the soil and [replant] within 5 years.
The scientists are using the genetic material from [RBDV] to induce
resistance in raspberry plants. [Three strategies are being used] to find
the best approach. [In the first one, a specific viral gene encoding a
protein that interferes with viral RNA replication is inserted into
raspberry plants]. In the second, [raspberry plants are engineered to
contain a viral protein that prevents movement of the virus from the primary
infected cell]. The third method involves inducing a raspberry plants to
make a small piece of viral RNA, or genetic material, that does not
[express] any protein. Through a natural plant mechanism, this viral RNA
[is] targeted by the plant for degradation.
They hope to refine the best strategy and provide breeding lines to growers
within 3 years. They should also be able to use the results to
incorporate virus resistance into other cultivars of raspberry [as well as]
blackberry [and] black raspberry.
An article on this research appears in the October issue of Agricultural
Research, the agency's monthly magazine. It is available online at:

[RBDV is the only species in the Idaeovirus genus. The virus was first
characterized in 1961 by Cadman in Scotland and is probably present wherever
raspberry is grown. Other common hosts are loganberry (_R. loganobaccus_),
boysenberry (_R. ursinus_) and black raspberry (_R. occindentalis_). A new
host is arctic bramble (_R. arcticus_) in Norway. The virus spreads
rapidly, presumably by infected/infested pollen. For example, in Oregon,
50% of a planting of "Marion" raspberry was infected within 6 years of
planting. Disease management depends heavily on use virus-free planting
stock and resistant or immune cultivars.
The reference for the virus in arctic bramble is: Kokko, H., Lemmetty, A.,
