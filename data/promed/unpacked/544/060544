The record increase in dengue fever cases in 2005 was associated with heavy
rainfalls, Dr. Maria del Rocio Saenz, Costa Rica Health Minister, explained
last Thursday.
Other reasons stated by the officer were the delay in the availability of
budget resources, as well as a false sense of confidence because of the
drop in the frequency of the disease in 2004.
"Last year we had 9000 cases, it was a huge success, but we relaxed ...
last Tuesday we reported 35 700 patients, and 51 of them had dengue
hemorrhagic fever", pointed out Dr. Saenz in a press conference at which
she presented her office's annual report. She reminded the audience that
only 2 patients died.

Nearly 35 400 dengue fever cases were reported in Costa Rica from January
to November 2005, up 311 percent from the same period of 2004, the Ministry
of Health said Monday. It was the largest increase since 1993.
The reported cases were also 147 percent higher than the largest yearly
figure ever registered in Costa Rica -- the 14 279 cases in 1997.
The ministry said 51 of the cases were accompanied by hemorrhagic fever,
the most deadly version of the disease. It also reported the first 2 deaths
of dengue fever in 6 years since the previous case in 1999.
However, the mosquito-borne disease's rate of spread was reduced by 68
percent in recent weeks to about 137 cases a week, thanks to a break in the
heavy rains in the country.
Costa Rica kicked off a campaign in August 2005 urging its people to
eliminate possible breeding places for the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ (the
main transmission agent of dengue fever), which breeds in stagnant water.

With 3 new cases of dengue reported today, the total number of cases in the
city is now 1005. The Health Department of the Municipal Corporation of
Delhi (MCD) had predicted the figure to reach 1200 by this time.
Health experts and MCD officials said the drop in temperature has resulted
in the end of the dengue outbreak. ''Mosquitoes that spread dengue stop
multiplying at low temperatures," said Dr N.P. Singh, Professor of
Medicine, Maulana Azad Medical College.
He says the lowest temperature at which these mosquitoes can survive is
about 15 degrees [Centigrade]. ''The few cases that are being reported now
are isolated ones. The decreasing number of cases indicate that the dengue
virus is on the decline,'' says Singh.
Municipal Health Officer Dr K.N. Tewari also said the number of cases has
gone down with the change in the weather. ''But until cases [stop] coming
from other states, we will not be able to control the disease,'' he said,
adding that an average of 2-3 cases from other states are reported
everyday. Of the 1005 cases reported from hospitals around the city, 360
are from other states. And of the 9 reported deaths, 5 are from other states.
According to Tewari, dengue outbreaks are periodic, i.e. they usually occur
every few years. The last outbreak happened in 2003, when 2843 cases and 34
deaths were reported. ''However, sometimes one peak is followed by another
the next year, as happened in Thailand,'' warns Tewari.
To prevent an outbreak next year [2006], says Tewari, precautions should be
taken starting in January or February. He says people need to make sure
their overhead tanks are completely sealed, even buy new lids if necessary,
to make sure mosquitoes do not breed.
''Though we carry out anti-dengue operations, no agency alone can stop the
spread of the disease. It has to be an initiative on the part of the people
as well,'' said Tewari.

Sri Lanka has reported an increase in the number of people affected by
dengue over the last few days following torrential rains and floods in many
parts of the country, Daily News reported Wednesday.
The dengue cases have increased to 67, health authorities said. The highest
number of dengue cases was reported from Colombo, followed by Matara. Cases
of dengue were also reported from Badulla, Kurunegala and Puttalam.
The healthcare and nutrition ministry said an integrated programme has been
launched to combat the spread of the diseases in flood-affected areas. The
ministry asked people to clean their wells after the floods recede.
The ministry also warned that water accumulation in pools may cause the
spread of mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue and [filariasis] and
requested people to ensure that pools of water are drained. [A similar
report was brought to ProMED's attention by Dr. Alfonso J. Rodriguez]

During the current epidemiological week, 838 dengue fever cases were
diagnosed, 62 of which (7.4 percent) were dengue hemorrhagic fever; the
dengue fever/dengue hemorrhagic fever ratio is 13/1. Cumulated case toll
for 2005 is 37 684 cases, 6.3 percent of which are dengue hemorrhagic fever
(2370 cases); the dengue fever/dengue hemorrhagic fever ratio is 15/1.
Cumulated morbidity rate is 141.8 per 100 000 inhabitants. Circulating
serotypes are 1, 2, 3, and 4. Cumulated case toll for this period shows a
36.3 percent increase compared to the same period of 2004. This week no
dengue-related deaths have been reported.
An 11.0 percent reduction in the number of dengue cases compared to figures
for last week was observed, and the epidemiological situation still
corresponds to an epidemic. Persons less than 15 years old make up 53.1
percent of all notified cases; persons 15 to 24 years old are the 2nd most
affected group, with 20.0 percent of all cases. Federal Regions reporting
highest cases figures are as follows: Capital District (82), Miranda (80),
Barinas (78), Merida (72), Lara (62), and Tachira (62).

Recent reports from the Municipal Epidemiology Service (MES) show a
reduction in the number of dengue fever cases in Libertador municipality;
however, epidemiologists do not consider that these figures definitive, [as
judged by] environmental parameters, such as rainfall, garbage, and debris
in some areas of the city. Dr. Lisbeth Suarez, a local epidemiologist
working at the MES, indicated that the parishes with the highest incidence
of dengue fever are Sucre, Antimano, La Vega, San Juan, and Santa Rosalia.
During the last epidemiological week in which official data had been
registered [week No. 47] (20-26 Nov), in which 95 dengue fever cases were
reported, 70 were classical and 20 were dengue hemorrhagic fever. Dr.
Suarez announced that fumigation and abate spraying have been performed in
areas most affected by dengue fever, e.g., El Cementerio and the
communities of Los Sin Techo and El Leon in Santa Rosalia parish. Dr.
Suarez stated that during November 2005 there was a reduction in the number
of dengue fever cases compared to 130 and 140 cases of dengue fever, which
[were commonly reported] in September and October, but she also said that
"this is not a successful situation".
According to the Epidemiological Bulletin from the Ministry of Health, in
Epidemiological Week No. 46 (13-19 Nov), 838 dengue fever cases were
diagnosed in Venezuela, 62 (7.4 percent) of them were dengue hemorrhagic
fever, and 776 were classical dengue fever.
As of the aforementioned report, there have been 37 684 dengue fever cases,
2370 corresponding to dengue hemorrhagic fever (6.3 percent) and the
remaining (35 314) classical dengue fever.
The cumulated case toll up to the 46th Epidemiological Week showed a 36.3
percent increase compared to registered cases during [2004]. In this last
week no deaths caused by this viral disease have been reported.
The Epidemiological Bulletin from the Ministry of Health indicates that
persons less than 15 years old are those most affected by dengue fever
(53.1 percent of all notified cases).
Libertador municipality is the area that had the highest case number (82),
followed by Miranda state (80), Barinas (78), Merida (72), Lara (62),
Tachira (62), Falcon (60); and Aragua (52).
Epidemiological Bulletin from the Ministry of Health considers this an
epidemic. Local and regional sanitary authorities, as well as the general
population, must take preventive measures.

On Monday, Semarang Mayor Sukawi Sutarip called for more support from 177
subdistrict heads in the fight against dengue fever, as 24 children have
died from the illness in 2005 (6 in the last 2 weeks) a much higher number
than the 7 fatalities recorded in 2004.
"I ask all heads of subdistricts in Semarang to observe all houses and
schools in their neighborhoods. On Tuesday morning, all students will take
part in an effort to clean their schools to rid them of mosquitoes," Sukawi
said.
He compared the rapid spread of dengue fever in the city to a massive fire.
"We should all work to 'extinguish' dengue fever. Tomorrow there will be a
massive fogging effort, so in the coming days, we all should take part in
preventing the rapid spread of the disease," he said.
Semarang recorded the highest number of dengue fever [cases] in Central
Java province, with 118 of its 177 subdistricts recording cases.

Dengue fever has killed 762 people in Indonesia so far this year [2005] and
infected some 62 000.
The health ministry's director general for infectious disease, I Nyoman
Kandun, provided the figures, warning that the toll from the mosquito-borne
disease could rise considerably in the next few months.
"The peak for dengue is around January and February," Kandun told AFP.
Indonesia faces annual outbreaks of dengue. It infected 74 621 people in
2004, killing 862 [a fatality rate of 1155 per 100 000], data from the
health ministry show.
Kandun said the government was promoting environmental hygiene, including
the elimination of possible breeding grounds for mosquitoes.
One of those infected this year was former president Megawati Sukarnoputri,
who had to be hospitalized for a few days in November 2005, but has since
recovered.

A Parliament report revealed that 1000 dengue infections were registered in
Shabowa governate (458 km southeast of Sana'a) as of 8 Jun 2005. The report
warned that dengue fever will spread to all provinces of the governate if
measures are not taken.
The report mentioned that current efforts to fight this disease are
insufficient in terms of technical, financial, and human resources. The
report asked the ministry to evaluate the situation by sending field teams
to all the governorates of Yemen.
Dengue fever is a treatable infectious disease carried by mosquitoes and is
found mostly during and shortly after the rainy season in tropical and
subtropical areas. Dengue can be caused by any one of 4 types of the dengue
virus: DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4. A person can be infected by at least
2, if not all 4 types at different times during a life span, but only once
by [each] type.
Since dengue fever was first detected on 16 Dec [what year?] in the small
city of Zabid in Hudaidah, 124 cases of infection have been reported. By
mid-January 7 people in the city had died of the disease, the ministry
report said.
Dr. Hashim Elzein, WHO representative in Yemen, said that type 1 was
discovered for the first time in some districts of Shabwa province in July
2002, then appeared again in 2003 in Ataq city, the capital of Shabwa province.
"The results from the laboratories showed that people from whom blood was
collected in Hudaidah and Zabid, as well as those from Shabwa, were exposed
to dengue fever before 2002," he explained.
The danger of dengue fever depends on its type, the doctor explained: "We
have to differentiate between dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever.
Dengue fever is usually without bleeding, but dengue hemorrhagic fever
causes hemorrhaging, and people can bleed from the gums, the intestines,
stomach or from the nose, as well as having other symptoms," Dr. Alzein said.

The Peruvian Ministry of Health (MINSA) has issued an alert. After an
exhaustive study performed in Lima, MINSA announced that the presence of
_Aedes aegypti_, the vector for dengue fever, has been detected in 112
areas in Lima (19 districts). They warn that there is a high risk for new
outbreaks of the disease this summer (mid-December to mid-April).
Even though municipalities are working alongside health authorities to
prevent dengue from developing within their area, there are problems that
will not be solved in time.
National Coordinator for the Sanitary Strategy Against Vector-Borne
Diseases at MINSA, Dr. Luis Miguel Leon, explained that the lack of
drinkable water is the main problem in the fight against dengue fever.
According to experts, it is a very difficult problem to be solved in 2 months.
"Finding one mosquito is enough reason to be worried about health in the
district. This is of more concern in areas that had already been affected
by this virus in the past", he informed.
Dr. Leon also called attention to the increasing risk that the possibility
lethal dengue hemorrhagic fever may develop in Comas.
According to MINSA reports, during 2005, 1200 dengue fever cases were
detected in La Libertad area in Comas District. Dr. Leon says that the
actual number of cases must be higher than the figures reported.
"A 2nd exposure to the virus increases the likelihood for developing
hemorrhagic dengue fever, and the epidemics may get complicated", he added.
Comas District Mayor, Mr. Julio Saldana, said that he is aware of the risk
for his community, since it is an area that has already been affected by
the virus. He announced that for this reason, prevention activities have
been carried out during the last few months in Comas neighborhoods.
"The 1st thing we did is to establish the 'Health [Round] Table,'
consisting of healthcare networks, the citizens, and the municipality", he
informed.
Major Saldana emphasized the importance of educating the population about
the actions necessary for preventing dengue fever. "We initiated an intense
campaign in coordination with health authorities so that the population may
learn what facilitates the growth of mosquito larvae."
Lack of drinkable water in the poorest areas in Lima makes them vulnerable
to the reproduction of the mosquito that is the vector for dengue. "Saving
water in receptacles outside houses and without any sanitary measures is a
risk for neighbours", said Dr. Leon.
In Comas, one of the most vulnerable areas, a new prevention system had
been implemented, using of larvicidal compounds.
Mr. Saldana also announced that bags containing larvicidal compound are
being given out to the residents of the most risky areas. "The bags'
contents are to be dissolved in the water container; it kills any mosquito
larvae. The effect lasts up to 15 days", he indicated.
Dr. Leon said that even though no cases have yet been reported yet, there
is a high risk.
