The number of cases of toxoplasmosis in Ponta de Pedras on Marajo Island has increased from 40 to 92.

The State Department of Health of Para (SESPA) and the Instituto Evandro Chagas are still investigating what is causing the outbreak in the city and have ruled out the possibility of transmission by the consumption of red meat. According to the investigation, the most likely cause of the outbreak is the lack of good hygiene practices.

Toxoplasmosis is an infectious disease caused by a protozoan parasite found in the feces of domestic and other cats. It can be acquired by ingestion of contaminated food and water and unwashed, raw vegetables.

"Most times, people have no symptoms, but low grade fever, enlarged lymph glands, or eye symptoms such as blurred vision, usually in one eye, are common symptoms," said Helena Brigido, infectious disease specialist.

City dwellers are concerned with the increase in the number of cases. "The biggest concern is toxoplasmosis in people who have very low immune defenses, such as people with cancer and HIV, and in pregnant women," Brigido said.

According to SESPA, officials of the technical secretariat are in Ponta de Pedras, but the situation is now under control. The secretariat is now working to prevent new cases of the disease.

[The rapid increase in cases points to a common water source as the most likely explanation. Toxoplasma cannot be transmitted by meat which has been cooked or fried and frozen below minus 18C for more than a week.

Toxoplasma infection is one of the most common causes of posterior uveitis [inflammation of the retina and vascular layer of the eye], and, especially, eye symptoms should alerts residents to contact their physician, as should pregnant women who experience fever with or without enlarged lymph glands. Acute toxoplasma eye disease and acute infection in pregnant women are an indication for treatment. - Mod.EP
