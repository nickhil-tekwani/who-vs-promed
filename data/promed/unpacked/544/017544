An outbreak of enteroviral infection has been reported in 7
settlements in the Republic of Buryatia, affecting 140 children under
18. Alexander Boloshinov, the head of the public health section of
the regional Rospotrebnadzor, told "Vostok-Teleinform" that the
outbreak investigation has indicated that swimming in the river
Selenga and in other bodies of water is the source of the outbreak.
All affected children had been admitted to hospital, and contacts
were being followed up. Disinfection procedures have been undertaken,
and drinking water supplies and pond water are being sampled
regularly. Special attention is being paid to kindergarten and
campsites.

[2] Enterovirus infection - Belarus (Gomel region)

40 people, mostly children between 3 and 16 years of age, have
contracted enteroviral infection in the Rogachevski region. In 36
cases, the infection was diagnosed as meningitis. The chief public
health doctor in the region reported that only 30 patients remain in
hospital now. He observed that the outbreak of enteroviral infection
may have spread by different routes, including droplet spread. Thus,
it has been difficult to identify the source of the outbreak.
Currently, preventive measures are being taken, and contacts are
being traced.
Provision of clean water has been improved, especially in relation to
supplies for preschool institutions and hospitals. The apparently
greater vulnerability of children can be explained by their greater
activity and inherent susceptibility. The public health official
commented further that the current outbreak situation could be
interpreted as a seasonal rise in morbidity. The overall incidence is
around 60 cases per month for the whole country. He indicated that
the medical condition of those affected was not severe. The most
recent serious outbreak of enterovirus infection in the Gomel region
occurred in 1997.

[In addition to the seasonal increase of enteroviral morbidity
observed in the Republic of Buryatia and the Gomel region of Belarus,
there have been outbreaks also in the Far East, caused by the
pollution of waterways and contamination of drinking water supplies.
