A mysterious horse disease in Western Australia that may have been passed on to people is in no way related to the Hendra virus, government officials say.

The state's Department of Agriculture and Food is leading an investigation into the cause of lesions that were found in some horses near Pinjarra, south of Perth, 3 weeks ago.

The lesions are described as small raised lumps on the tongue and gums [The previous statement seems to apply to horses. - Mod.TG]. Since the discovery, the lesions have appeared in humans who have had contact with the horses, although the people have been described as generally well. The Department of Health is assisting with the investigation of the affected humans.

"At this stage, it is not clear if there is a relationship between the lesions reported in horses and people, and testing has not, as yet, revealed a cause for the lesions in either horses or people," a Department of Health spokesman said. "Further testing will be conducted if indicated."

The spokesman said the lesions were in no way related to the Hendra virus, despite that being mentioned in a media report. The department has advised people handling affected horses to take precautions, including wearing disposable gloves and a face mask and washing their hands well after contact.

The NSW Department of Primary Industries said on Monday [8 Jul 2013] that 3 horses had died from Hendra virus on the NSW mid-north coast in a month.

[There is very little information here. Small bumps on the tongue and gums is not much information. The story is unclear regarding the lesions. It appears from this story these bumps may be on the horses and the people. The article does not speak of illness, or fever, or even whether any blood tests or cultures of the lesions have been performed.

Furthermore, it seems to have spread to NSW, as it was 1st reported in Western Australia and now in Western Australia with a human connection. There seems to be no new information. What is being tested for? Are there other clinical signs? If someone with more authoritative information could share more specifics, it would be helpful.
