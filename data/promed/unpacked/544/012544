CDC is collaborating with public health and agriculture officials in many states and the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Heidelberg infections. Public health investigators are using DNA "fingerprints" of _Salmonella_ bacteria obtained through diagnostic testing with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE, to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak. They are using data from PulseNet, the national subtyping network made up of state and local public health laboratories and federal food regulatory laboratories that performs molecular surveillance of foodborne infections.

Seven strains of _S._ Heidelberg bacteria have been identified as being linked to this outbreak. Four of these strains are rarely reported to PulseNet. The other 3 strains are more common, with several ill persons infected with each strain reported to CDC monthly. The DNA fingerprints of the _S._ Heidelberg bacteria associated with the current outbreak include the strain that was also associated with a multistate outbreak of _S._ Heidelberg linked to Foster Farms brand chicken during 2012-2013.

As of 7 Oct 2013, a total of 278 individuals infected with the outbreak strains of _S._ Heidelberg have been reported from 17 states. Most of the ill persons (77 percent) have been reported from California. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: Alaska (2), Arkansas (1), Arizona (11), California (213), Colorado (4), Connecticut (1), Florida (1), Hawaii (1), Idaho (2), Michigan (2), North Carolina (1), Nevada (8), Oregon (8), Texas (5), Utah (2), Washington (15) and Wisconsin (1).

Among 274 persons for whom information is available, illness onset dates range from 1 Mar 2013 to 24 Sep 2013. Ill persons range in age from less than one year to 93 years, with a median age of 20 years. 51 percent of ill persons are male. Among 183 persons with available information, 76 (42 percent) reported being hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Investigation of the Outbreak
--------------------------
Epidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback investigations conducted by officials in local, state, and federal public health, agriculture, and regulatory agencies indicate that consumption of Foster Farms brand chicken is the likely source of this outbreak of _S._ Heidelberg infections.

In interviews, ill persons answered questions about foods consumed and other exposures during the week before becoming ill. 105 (80 percent) of 132 ill persons interviewed report consuming chicken prepared at home in the week before becoming ill. This proportion is significantly higher when compared with results from a survey of healthy persons in which 65 percent reported consuming chicken prepared at home in the week before they were interviewed. Among those who had brand information available, 48 (79 percent) of 61 ill persons reported that they had consumed Foster Farms brand chicken or another brand likely produced by Foster Farms.

The National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) retail meat surveillance program is an ongoing collaboration among the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine, CDC, and participating state public health laboratories. NARMS monitors antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from raw retail meats. NARMS laboratorians isolated 4 of the 7 outbreak strains from 5 retail samples of Foster Farms chicken breasts and wings collected in California. Four of these isolates exhibited drug resistance to one or more commonly prescribed antibiotics. Of these, 2 were multidrug resistant (defined as resistance to 3 or more classes of antibiotics). Not all isolates from poultry exhibited the same antibiotic-resistance pattern. To date, isolates collected from poultry were resistant to combinations of the following antibiotics: ampicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, kanamycin, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline.

Additionally, CDC's NARMS laboratory conducted antibiotic-resistance testing on clinical isolates collected from 5 ill persons infected with 2 of the 7 outbreak strains. Four of these isolates exhibited drug resistance to one or more commonly prescribed antibiotics. Of those, 2 were multidrug resistant. One isolate was susceptible to all antibiotics tested. To date, isolates collected from ill persons were resistant to combinations of the following antibiotics: ampicillin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, kanamycin, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline. Antimicrobial resistance may increase the risk of hospitalization or possible treatment failure in infected individuals.

Testing conducted by the Washington State Public Health Laboratories identified one of the outbreak strains of _S._ Heidelberg in a leftover intact sample of raw Foster Farms chicken collected from an ill person's home in Washington.

Preliminary laboratory testing identified 4 of the 7 outbreak strains from multiple chicken product samples at 3 Foster Farms facilities; additional analysis is ongoing. USDA-FSIS has issued a Public Health Alert due to concerns that illnesses caused by strains of _S._ Heidelberg are associated with raw chicken products produced by Foster Farms at 3 facilities in California. At this point in the investigation, FSIS is unable to link the illnesses to a specific product and a specific production period. The products were mainly distributed to retail outlets in California, Oregon and Washington State. Raw products from the facilities in question bear one of the establishment numbers inside a USDA mark of inspection or elsewhere on the package: "P6137," "P6137A," and "P7632."

CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill persons and to interview them about foods eaten before becoming ill. USDA-FSIS is continuing to work closely with CDC and state partners during this investigation.

The number of victims in the national outbreak of salmonella linked to raw chicken rose to 317 on Fri 11 Oct 2013, health officials reported. The illnesses have been reported in 20 states and Puerto Rico, the CDC said. The majority of cases, 73 percent, have been in California. No deaths have been reported. The outbreak has been linked to chicken from 3 Foster Farms processing plants in central California, the Department of Agriculture said.

The company submitted a plan outlining "substantive changes to their slaughter and processing" to USDA on Thu 10 Oct 2013, said Dan Englejohn, with USDA's Food Safety Inspection Service. Based on that, the agency announced it would allow Foster Farms to continue operating the 3 plants.

[Clearly, this outbreak is ongoing. Reporting of outbreak strains may be delayed here because of the partial government shutdown currently occurring. It is noteworthy that the chicken was processed in 3 separate plants rather that one specific plant, suggesting a more systemic problem. - Mod.LL
