Cattle Disease Diagnostic System (CaDDiS) is a computer program which attempts to aid the diagnosis
of certain common tropical diseases in cattle. The system is based on a Bayesian belief network
approach, and evaluates the relative likelihood of a cow having any of the specified diseases given
the observation of particular clinical signs.
The Interactive CaDDiS model can be found at:

This project is part of a Veterinary Informatics & Epidemiology (VIE) joint venture between the
University of Strathclyde and the University of Glasgow [UK].

[I checked out the diagnostic page as well as the others. There is some good information. I am a
bit concerned. On the diagnostic page there appear to be only 20 diseases and I cannot seem to get
it to list the 20. However, some of those are "foreign animal diseases" to the US, but not
necessarily to other countries. They are all infectious diseases and there appear to be substantial
gaps in the diseases that are covered. However, there is some good information on the page links to
those diseases - Mod.TG]
