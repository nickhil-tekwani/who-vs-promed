On Thursday 4 May 2000, the Health Ministry of Belarus informed Interfax
that 14 pupils of one of the second schools in Khoyniki, Gomel province
(oblast), were hospitalised with diagnosis of salmonellosis. Preliminary
data [indicate that the disease was caused by food which was offered
pupils in the school's canteen. [According to the Health Ministry,
infected meat from which some dishes (ravioli, goulash) were prepared
[appears to be the source. There were 260 pupils of the Khoyniki school in
all who were observed by the sanitary service for the prophylactic
purposes. Physicians reported the condition of the hospitalised 14 pupils
is a [moderately serious.
Natalia Petracheva, Chief physician of the Khoiniki district (rayon) Center
of the Hygiene and Epidemiology, explained to Interfax that usually [the
source of the _Salmonella_ agent source is infected meat or eggs. She
noticed also that all
children establishments in Khoyniki get food from the same kitchen. But
there were no reports from other establishments. N. Petracheva said that
from the results of the epidemiological investigation specialists of the
Khoiniki San-Epi station developed a preliminary [suspicion that a
_Salmonella_ carrier is [among the school kitchen workers.
