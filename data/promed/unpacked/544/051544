Authorities have attributed low cassava production in most districts of [Malawi] to rapid spread of cassava mosaic disease.

The international organization CAVA (Cassava Adding Value in Africa) said the situation is worsening due to climate change. [They say] it is high time farmers adopt planting disease resistant varieties [and they] intensify promotion of 4 disease resistant cassava varieties.

[Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) has triggered food emergencies in the past by destroying cassava crops throughout whole regions. It is caused by a number of species and strains in the genus _Begomovirus_ which seem to be associated with it in different areas (for example, see ProMED-mail post 20160623.4304471). Co-infections as well as genetic recombination between strains have also been reported, and recombinant strains can be particularly virulent.

CMD symptoms include leaf mosaic, distortion, and stunting of plants leading to severe reduction of tuber yields. The CMD viruses are spread by whitefly vectors and with infected plant material (including seed tubers). At least one of them (_African cassava mosaic virus_; ACMV) has also been found in an alternative host (soybean) suggesting that these viruses may have a wider host reservoir and may pose a threat to other crops as well. Disease management for begomoviruses usually relies on control of their vectors as well as pathogen and/or vector reservoir plants, but these methods have proven unsatisfactory in developing countries.

Because most traditional cassava cultivars are susceptible to CMD, varieties resistant to different viral strains are being developed for local use. In Africa, this has alleviated the problem in some areas, but in others, the new varieties are being wiped out by _Cassava brown streak virus_ (CBSV; genus _Ipomovirus_ and transmitted like CMD). Recent outbreaks of CBSD [cassava brown streak disease] appear to indicate a westward spread of the viruses (ProMED-mail post 20130508.1698543). A new CBSV strain adapted to higher altitudes has emerged in eastern Africa and is affecting additional CMD resistant cultivars (ProMED-mail posts 20100525.1735 and 20120706.1191742).

Joint management of both diseases has become a major challenge in the region and globally (ProMED-mail post 20110829.2643) since development of crop varieties with stable resistance to multiple viruses is particularly difficult (ProMED-mail post 20090709.2463). The different viruses can be expected to mutate independently resulting in a range of changing combinations of strains, and different crop varieties are likely to be needed which are geared towards local viral populations.

In Malawi, CBSV is known to be present as well as CMD. A CBSV alert was issued in 2011 (ProMED-mail post 20110318.0857) and a breeding programme for CBSV resistant crop varieties established. No information is given in the report above whether the promoted CMD resistant varieties have been assessed for their level of sensitivity to CBSV.
