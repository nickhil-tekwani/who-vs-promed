A listener told Radio Dabanga that 2 civilians died from an infection, and 2 other infected [individuals] remain in the hospital of El Fula [Al-Fulah], West Kordofan. They all showed symptoms that may qualify for the deadly Ebola [virus] disease.

The director of El Fula hospital, close to Sudan's border with South Sudan, said that the hospital treats the 2 patients the same as patients with haemorrhagic fever. They show the same symptoms as the 2 civilians who died in Muglad this week: nosebleeds and high fever.

Speaking to Radio Dabanga, the production manager of the petrol company Energy for Petrol, working in oil fields near El Fula, said that he called El Fula hospital for information about the patients and the [possible] Ebola virus [infections]. The director told him that the infected patients showed symptoms of bleeding and fever.

The production manager asked his employees via Radio Dabanga to take caution and attend to their personal hygiene.

[Not enough detail is provided for these 4 cases to make a definite diagnosis. Interestingly, no mention is made of diarrhea, a common symptom of Ebola virus disease in the current outbreak in West Africa. Yellow fever (YF) virus infection is an obvious possibility, given that it has occurred in the region in the not-too-distant past. Between 3 Oct and 24 Nov 2013, a total of 44 confirmed cases of YF were reported, including 14 deaths. A total of 12 localities in West and South Kordofan were affected by that outbreak.

A thorough laboratory study is needed for the cases above. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving information about additional cases or results of any laboratory tests that become available.
