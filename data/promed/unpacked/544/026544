A baby has died and 14 are ill with blood infections after being given what appears to be a contaminated batch of liquid food. The babies, many of which were premature, were all being cared for in neonatal intensive care units at 6 hospitals across England.

The newborn who died was being treated at London's Guy's and St Thomas's Hospital. The surviving babies are said to be responding to antibiotic treatment. They were all given the liquid nourishment direct to their bloodstream as they could not be mouth fed.

Public Health England and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) are investigating. They said as the blood infection, caused by a bacterium known as _Bacillus cereus_, develops quickly they were not expecting any more cases. In a statement, the 2 organisations said: "Investigations with the company have identified an incident that might have caused contamination."

An alert has been issued to recall the contaminated product, manufactured by ITH Pharma Limited, from hospitals. The batch expired on Monday, 2 Jun 2014, so should not have been used in the past 2 days. A total of 162 units were sent out from the contaminated batch to over 20 hospitals.

The neonatal units that have reported cases are:
- Chelsea and Westminster NHS Trust, London (4 cases)
- Guy's and St Thomas's NHS Foundation Trust, London (3 cases)
- Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust (3 cases)
- Addenbrooke's, Cambridge University Hospitals (2 cases)
- Luton and Dunstable University Hospital (2 cases)
- The Whittington Hospital, London (1 case)

_Bacillus cereus_ is a bacterium found widely in the environment in dust, soil and vegetation. Most surfaces would be likely to test positive for the presence of the bacterium.

Microbiologist Professor Hugh Pennington said the bacterium caused food poisoning. "When the bug gets into the bloodstream by direct injection into these very, very frail little babies, that have really got no immune defenses of their own yet, that can be catastrophic," he said.

Prof Mike Catchpole, Public Health England's incident director, said: "This is a very unfortunate incident and PHE have been working closely with the MHRA to investigate how these babies could have become infected. Given that the bacterium is widely spread in the environment we are continuing to investigate any other potential sources of infection. However all our investigations to date indicate that the likely source of the infection has been identified."

ITH Pharma managing director Karen Hamling said the company was "very saddened" by the baby's death and was co-operating fully with the investigation.

Prof Ron Cutler, director of Biomedical Science Degree Programmes, Queen Mary University of London, said: "_Bacillus cereus_ is widespread in the environment. It is commonly found in the soil. Poorly cooked foods such as rice, which can be contaminated with these spores, are a common cause of food poisoning. Because they form spores, it makes it more difficult to disinfect surfaces and materials contaminated with these spores without using high temperatures and/or powerful disinfectants. In addition, when untreated, spores can survive in environments for long time periods."

[Primarily, _B. cereus_ in clinical medicine is a cause of toxin-related foodborne disease often related to poorly stored rice and may cause either a primarily emetic or diarrheal disease. This outbreak of disease is not necessarily toxin related but related to contaminated intravenous nutrition given to neonates, mostly premature babies.

_B. cereus_ bacteremia in neonates is not at all common, but has been reported. Hilliard and colleagues (1) reported a case in a premature infant and reviewed the literature citing 21 other reported cases, but none of them were related to contaminated intravenous nutrition. A French report in 2014 comments on 2 other cases and cites several others, but does not report the source being intravenous nutrition (2).

This moderator would refer the reader to Ed Bottone's review on _B. cereus_ (3). The section on nosocomial transmission mentions environmental reservoirs of the organism including contaminated air filtration and ventilation equipment, fiber- optic bronchoscopy equipment, linen, gloves, hands of staff, intravenous catheters, alcohol-based hand wash solutions, specimen collection tubes, balloons used in manual ventilation and reused towels.
