Deaths at Kumasi Academy have been linked to spread of influenza. The health minister is calling for students to still stay on campus. It has emerged that the cause of mysterious deaths at the Kumasi Academy is due to type A influenza, the strain [that] causes the deadly swine flu.

Addressing the press in an emergency briefing, the health minister, Kwaku Agyeman-Manu, revealed that out of 44 cases reported, only 4 have died, bringing a total of 11 deaths in the year alone.

Samples of students taken for intense investigation at Nuguchi [Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, Accra] revealed that out of the 19 samples collected, 12 tested positive for influenza type A.

Meanwhile, the health minister is calling for all students to be kept on campus to provide that vaccinations to control the outbreak are ensured.

A senior pathologist at KATH, Dr Osei Sampene, revealed on Nyira FM that "all bodies of students from Kumasi Academy showed signs of a strange disease, which could also be one of its kind in Ghana." Meanwhile, vaccines are currently being administered to all students to protect them against possible viral or bacterial infections.

Parliament has summoned the minister for health, Kwaku Agyemang-Manu on updates related to the deaths of persons. According to him, any attempt by parents to send their wards home poses a serious national security threat since the cause of their deaths is strangely unknown.

The current atmosphere at Kumasi Academy is that of fear and uncertainty as parents run to the school to see if their wards are doing well, as others demand to take their wards home with them. The death toll continues to rise, as the total number of persons losing [their] lives in a week alone has reached 6.

Indications from the government are that the students and staff of Kumasi Academy will remain in the school till response efforts to the detected influenza virus are completed. Addressing Parliament on Friday [8 Dec 2017], the Health Minister, Kwaku Agyeman-Manu, said efforts are already underway in this regard while disease surveillance measures are being strengthened.

Parents want public health prioritized. "Mr. Speaker, going forward, the ministries of Health and Education, the Ghana Health Service, and the Ghana Education Service have recommended, and we are embarking upon that, that students should continue to remain [on the school's premises] to enable final conclusion and response actions," the Minister said.

Initially, the Kumasi Academy was set to close down today [Fri 8 Dec 2017] until it became clearer that the health crisis in the school was brought by the pandemic strain of influenza type A, H1N1 2009, also known as swine flu.

The government is thus looking for support from the World Health Organization (WHO) to provide influenza vaccines for the students and staff.

The health crisis at the school has claimed 4 lives and hospitalized at least 32. However, the outright cause of death of the 4 students of the school and the hospitalization of 32 has yet to be fully confirmed.

Minister of Health, Kwaku Agyemang-Manu added on the floor of Parliament that the government was going to rely on antiviral agents. "We have procured already, and we are in the process of procuring, antiviral agents for case management. So far, that is what has been used, and it looks like it has succeeded in containing and treating the disease. Aside from these, steps are also being taken to enhance school health at Kumasi Academy, and there will be strict adherence to infection prevention and control measures along with intensified sensitisation and public education," Mr. Agyemang-Manu added.

Finally, the health authorities have confirmed that there is an influenza outbreak at Kumasi Academy School. The health Minister assured parliament that his ministry was in discussions with the WHO to obtain vaccines for the students and staff of the school.

It appears obvious that there was no plan in place to tackle the outbreak, which killed 4 students and has left another 18 students on admission.

While the plans to vaccinate the student body [are] appropriate, have close contacts of the dead and the sick been identified? How and where have these been monitored? Are there plans to provide them with chemoprophylaxis?

In March of this year [2017], 4 students of the same school were reported to have died of meningitis. If this report is accurate, what measures were taken before the students returned to school?

In an interaction with the press, the Minister of Health indicated that the president had been exposed. Who determined the exposure? If indeed the president was exposed, what steps have been taken to safeguard his health? Why was he permitted to go to the campus when there was an outbreak whose source had not been determined? Why was it deemed safe to have the school's anniversary celebration during the outbreak?

Finally, too often, we do not learn the right lessons from such events. Hopefully, our authorities will develop a policy to handle such occurrences in the future.

[The 1st news report above says that there have been 44 cases reported, with 4 deaths in the current outbreak among students at Kumasi Academy; however, later in this news report the number of deaths in the current outbreak is stated to be 6; also 12 of 19 samples, the exact source of the samples not being specified, tested positive for influenza virus type A. Were the "samples" respiratory secretions? Were the people sampled the dead students, the surviving hospitalized students, or non-hospitalized students with mild illness? The 2nd news report above says that this influenza A virus identified was "the pandemic strain, H1N1 2009 also known as swine flu," but questions whether influenza was "the outright cause of death of the 4 students at the school and the hospitalization of 32 has yet to be fully confirmed."

The H1N1 virus that caused the pandemic in 2009-2010 is now a regular human flu virus that continues to circulate seasonally worldwide and is now called A(H1N1)pdm09. A remarkable feature of A/(H1N1)pdm09 in the 2009 pandemic, compared with other seasonal strains, was noted to be its high fatality rate, admissions to ICUs for acute respiratory distress, and its higher incidence among younger people (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27941959, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5632968/, http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0904252#t=abstract, and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4910438/).

The current influenza vaccines protect against an influenza A (H1N1) virus, an influenza A (H3N2) virus, and one or 2 influenza B viruses (depending on the vaccine). Currently circulating influenza viruses are reported to be susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral medications, oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir; however, rare sporadic instances of oseltamivir-resistant and peramivir-resistant influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have been detected worldwide (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm). Antiviral treatment as early as possible is recommended for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza who have severe, complicated, or progressive illness; who require hospitalization; or who are at high risk for serious influenza-related complications (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/antivirals/index.htm).

More information on this outbreak at Kumasi Academy would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources, especially the findings of post-mortem exams on the 4 or 6 students who died recently.

Kumasi Academy is a public secondary boarding school located in Asokore-Mampong, a suburb of the city of Kumasi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumasi_Academy). Kumasi, with an estimated population in 2013 of over 2 million residents, is the capital of the Ashanti region of Ghana (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumasi). Maps of Ghana can be seen at http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/africa/political-map-of-Ghana.gif and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=5494656,50377. The Ashanti region is located in south-central Ghana and is the 3rd largest of 10 administrative regions, with a population of about 3.6 million residents in 2000, accounting for 19.1 percent of Ghana's total population (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashanti_Region). - Mod.ML

It is very pertinent to know whether the samples that tested positive for influenza came from the fatal or hospitalized cases as referred to by ML, influenza associated morbidity and mortality rates are generally high in very young or the very old, the age group of these students is also not specified. Ghana is in West Africa and lies in Northern Hemisphere where the seasonal influenza activity is just picking up..Also the presentation of many viral infections is with 'flu' like symptoms, therefore the possibility of another viral pathogen cannot be ruled out unless results from other lab tests or autopsy findings are available-Mod.UBA]
