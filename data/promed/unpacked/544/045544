Dozens of unique freshwater seals have been found dead
on the shores of Lake Baikal, according to an Interfax report.
The cause of those deaths was unclear.

The bodies of 36 seals washed up near the village of Utulik in
eastern Siberia, and an additional 42 on the shore of the town
Baikalsk, the Interfax news agency reported 8 June 1999.
The report didn't specify when the animals were believed to
have died or provide any other details. [No details were
provided regarding the type of seals.
Local emergency officials speculate poaching or a plague
might have been responsible. Experts took water and tissue
samples, but hadn't reached a conclusion.
Lake Baikal holds the world's largest volume of fresh water --
some 20 percent of the world's supply. It is home to nearly
1000 animal species found nowhere else in the world,
including the freshwater ringed seals (_Phoca hispida_) .
Previous cases of mass deaths of Baikal seals were blamed
on infectious disease and poisonous chemical waste from
a pulp mill.
[Lake Baikal is located in Eastern Siberia in the southern
regions near the border with Mongolia. Irkutsk is on the
shores of the lake. It is also the deepest freshwater
lake in the world. It is located at over 1600 meters altitude
(5250 feet). It is the home of the nerpa (_Phoca sibirica_),
one of the smallest seals in the world, and felt to be an
endangered species. Provided by MPP. - Mod.TG
