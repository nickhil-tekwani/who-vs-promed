France recalls internationally distributed halal meat products from
the plant implicated as the source of a type B botulism outbreak
---------------------------------------------------
4 cases of botulism linked to consumption of contaminated halal*
sausage made from beef and poultry meat, were notified by the local
French health authorities (Direction Departementale des Affaires
Sanitaires et Sociales (DDASS)) from 2 departments on 1 Sep 2003. The
presence of botulinum toxin type B was confirmed in serum specimens
of all 4 cases.
3 of the cases occurred in the same family in the department of
Bouches du Rhone (southeast France). All 4 patients had relatively
mild symptoms (difficulty in swallowing, blurred and double vision),
with onset on 25 Aug 2003. All were admitted to hospital and have now
recovered. Products from the implicated producer are known to have
been distributed throughout France and exported to Italy and the
Comoros islands, but no other cases have so far been reported.
All 4 patients had eaten halal sausage from the same producer. The 3
cases in southeastern France ate the implicated sausage on 21 Aug
2003, and the case in the department of Loire-Atlantique (western
France) ate it on 25 Aug. The sausage was purchased from 2 halal
butchers in Marseille (for the 3 family cases in southeastern
France), and at a halal meat counter in a supermarket in Nantes (for
the case in western France).
Botulinum toxin B has been confirmed in the sausage eaten by the case
in western France. The traceback study in western France has shown
that the implicated brand of sausage sold by the supermarket came
from a producer that is the sole supplier of halal products
distributed by the supermarket chain. The traceback study in
southeastern France has shown that the sausage eaten by the family
came from the same producer. Sausage and other meat products were
taken from the 2 halal butchers' that the family had visited and have
been sent to the national reference laboratory (Centre National de
Reference des bacteries anaerobies et du botulisme, CNR) for testing.
The southeastern authorities have carried out an investigation with
the implicated producer to identify potentially contaminated batches,
the origin of the contamination, and the geographical distribution of
the products.
On 5 Sep 2003, the national Veterinary and Food Administration
(Direction Generale de l'Alimentation (DGAl)) recalled the implicated
batches of beef poultry sausage. On 12 Sep 2003, the product recall
was extended to all meat products from the implicated producer with a
'use by' date of 12 Mar 2004 or earlier. A European alert was issued
through the European Commission's weekly Rapid Alert System for Food
and Feed after investigations showed that products from the
implicated production plant had been distributed in Italy and the
Comoros islands.

No other botulism case potentially related to the consumption of this
type of product has been reported to National Health Surveillance
Institute (Institut de Veille Sanitaire (InVS)) or the CNR.
Botulism incidence in France has been stable since 1990, with an
annual average of 15 outbreaks and 28 cases. Type B toxin is the most
frequent cause and is involved in 87 percent of cases. Transmission
is predominantly foodborne, and at present no case of wound botulism
has been identified (1,2). The most frequent food sources are
home-preserved ham or other pork products, and home-bottled
vegetables. Since 1990, commercial products have been implicated in
23 of 137 outbreaks with a confirmed or suspected food source (1, 2).

[For our readers information, this is more information on halal:
Halal is an Arabic word meaning lawful or permitted. The opposite of
halal is haram, which means unlawful or prohibited. Halal and haram
are universal terms that apply to all facets of life. The terms are
often used only in relation to food products, meat products,
cosmetics, personal care products, food ingredients, and food contact
materials.
While many things are clearly halal or clearly haram, some things are
not clearly one or the other. These items are considered questionable
or suspect, and more information is needed to categorize them. Such
items are often referred to as Mashbooh, which means doubtful or
questionable.
All foods are considered Halal except the following, which are haram:
Swine/pork and its by-products
Animals improperly slaughtered or dead before [being brought for] slaughter
Animals killed in the name of anyone other than Allah
Alcohol and intoxicants
Carnivorous animals, birds of prey, and land animals without external ears
Blood and blood by-products
Foods contaminated with any of the above products. - Mod.LL]
