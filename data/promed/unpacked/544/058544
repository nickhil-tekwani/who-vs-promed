A fungal species affecting fresh water fish, _Saprolegnia_, has been
pointed out as the cause of death of many fish, particularly Iberian
nase (and/or Duero nase), during this spring season [2011] in the
Capital City (Leon, province of Castile and Leon), according to
sources from Leon University.

The investigation started last April [2011] after the appearance of
hundreds of dead fish, most of them Iberian nase in upriver areas of
the Bernesga river, near the bridge to the Parador Nacional de San
Marcos in Leon.

The Duero River Hydrographic Authority (CHD, Confederacion
Hidrogafica del Duero, according to its Spanish initials) requested a
study of the Bernesga River water at various points, particularly
temperature, oxygen dissolution, oxygen saturation, pH, and
conductivity, and the waters complied with safety requirements, as
told to EFE by a source from the CHD.

Fish samples were taken to the Veterinary school, where it was
concluded they died because of _Saprolegnia_ infections, a fungus
species that affects freshwater fish, endemic in Leon province rivers,
and that has been affecting other fish in the area, particularly
trout.

All the information available indicates that the infection is a
natural occurrence, and the logical next step is that the process may
gradually subside, according to the same source.

Water may influence the occurrence of this fungus, even though the
analyses performed by CHD stated that the water's condition is
absolutely normal. However, the same sources from the University
pointed out that the water is in constant movement and that it may be
quite difficult to determine its condition in a given moment, although
they have ruled out contamination by waste, and insist this is a
natural occurrence, as has happened in the past.

CHD took samples from the Bernesga River, near the San Marcos inn,
near the localities of Cuadros and La Robla, and in the Olleros stream
in this latter village.

>From the beginning of the event, CHD pointed out that waste dumping
in Bernesga River was a very unlikely cause for this occurrence, since
the river now has a high discharge near Leon city, because of the
recent rains.
