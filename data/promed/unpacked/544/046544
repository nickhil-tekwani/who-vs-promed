New World screwworm (_Cochliomyia hominivorax_) in Mexico
Emergency report
Translation of information received on 17 Feb 2003 from Dr Jose Angel Del
Valle Molina, Director General of Animal Health, Secretariat of
Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food, Mexico City:
Report date: 13 Feb 2003.
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 5 Feb 2003.
Outbreaks:
Location: Chiapa de Corzo, State of Chiapas
No. of outbreaks: 2
Total number of animals in the outbreaks:
species / susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
bov / 191 / 3 / 0 / 0 / 0
Diagnosis:
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was confirmed: Laboratory of Entomology of
the Mexico-USA Commission for the eradication of screwworm, located in
Chiapa de Corzo, State of Chiapas.
B. Diagnostic tests used: direct microscopy.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: on 28 Jan 2003, due to a failure
in the sterilization process at the Sterile Flies Production Plant
Irradiating Unit No. 2, fertile flies were released from release chambers
situated around the plant.
B. Mode of spread: air-borne, by infestation of the skin lesions of bovines
in the district where the plant is located.
Control measures:
- Strengthening of biosafety measures within the plant.
- Release of 41 182 500 sterile flies in the areas at risk and release of
17 003 100 sterile flies around the plant and in the affected districts.
- Field activities aimed at promoting the reporting of suspected cases and
at carrying out detection of screwworm lesions that may be due to
_Cochliomyia hominivorax_, began on 5 Feb 2003.
- Restrictions on the movement of animals and animal products; ban on the
movement of wounded animals.
- Inspection of 1896 animals at 4 checkpoints; the animals that are moved
are dipped in organophosphorus compounds at a larvicidal dosage.
- A number of [local government offices] (47), district presidencies (45),
communal land authorities (354), livestock rearers' associations (48),
and veterinary drugstores (133) were visited, with a total of 4766 tubes
being distributed for sample collection as well as 8080 powder sachets for
the treatment of screwworm lesions.
- A total of 23 meetings were held with farmers and films about screwworm
were shown.
- A total of 4075 information leaflets were distributed.
- Press releases and television interviews were broadcast, as well as 360
advertisements on 8 local radio stations. Advertising material and posters
promoting the reporting and sending of samples were placed in strategic sites.
- Trapping of adult flies is being carried out. An average of 9909 flies
are trapped every day, and their gender and fertility rate are determined.
- To date, 176 roads have been covered, 3049 production units visited, and
4516 interviews carried out, with 59 samples being confirmed positive for
_Cochliomyia hominivorax_.

[Finding the parasite in cattle was expected once unsterilized flies were
released earlier this month in Panama (see reference). Those flies were
produced in Chiapas. It appears some of the unsterilized flies must have
been released from the plant itself. So now we have disease where the
flies were produced but no report yet of disease where they were
released. It is important to know other locations where the flies were
released and how long other batches of flies have lacked proper
sterilization. All this is analogous to an outbreak investigation of a
contaminated batch of feed or food.
Since the flies have been identified in 2 locations, it would be most
helpful to everyone in Central America to know whether they might have
received an unsterilized batch of flies. If so, they can expect disease,
and surveillance should be intensified significantly. A brief incursion
occurred in 2001, also in Chiapas, affecting 18 cattle with screwworm, the
larva of the dipterous fly _Cochliomyia hominivorax_. Hopefully, this
release will follow the same course.
Screwworm can be devastating to the livestock industry and can occasionally
cause disease in humans. The history of eradication of this pest from the
United States and Mexican livestock population is quite interesting.
