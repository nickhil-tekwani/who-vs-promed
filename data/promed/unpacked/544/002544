Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: San Antonio de Oriente, Valle de Yeguare, San Antonio de Oriente, Francisco Morazan
Date of start of the outbreak: 18 Nov 2019
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 23 017 / 57 / 48 / 0 / 31920
Affected population: table egg-laying hens in a multi-age commercial farm.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds / 0.25 / 0.21 / 84.21 / 14.08
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: under the passive epidemiological surveillance system for poultry diseases, a mortality problem was reported in domestic laying hens on a multi-age commercial farm; the birds showed clinical signs and lesions compatible with fowl typhoid. Routine bacteriological and relevant biochemical tests were performed and _Salmonella gallinarum_ was diagnosed on [28 Nov 2019]. The affected farm has been quarantined and farms in the area are subject to epidemiological surveillance with restrictions on bird movement and continuous surveillance by sampling.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; screening; traceability; quarantine; zoning; disinfection; slaughter; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

["Fowl typhoid in chickens and turkeys is caused by _Samonella gallinarum_ biovar Gallinarum and is more often observed in the later growing period and in mature stock. Disease is often characterized by rapid spread with high morbidity and acute or subacute mortality. Red mites may be involved in the transmission of disease and persistence in poultry houses.

"Clinical signs in chicks and poults include anorexia, diarrhea, dehydration, weakness, and death. In mature birds, Pullorum disease is less severe but decreased egg production, poor hatchability, and some increased mortality may occur. Fowl typhoid is a more acute septicemic condition which mainly affects mature birds and may be particularly severe in commercial laying flocks.

"_Salmonella gallinarum_ and _S. pullorum_ are host adapted to avian species and are considered to pose a minimal zoonotic risk. Although the genome is adapted to a non-intestinal environment and has lost flagella genes to help evade host immune responses, it is continually evolving, which could theoretically widen the host range in future. Non-typhoidal _Salmonella_ serovars should be handled with appropriate biosafety and containment procedures as determined by biological risk analysis.

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2019, Chapter 3.3.11 "Fowl typhoid and Pullorum disease" at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.03.11_FOWL_TYPHOID.pdf.
