ProMED-mail would like to thank Alan Shlosberg <alans@moag.gov.il> for
pointing out that there was a mistake in ProMED-mail posting Avian
influenza - Eurasia (13): H5N1 20051016.3018 "...to allocate ILS 150
million [USD 181 million]." The correct figure for 150 million Israeli
Shekels should be 32.8 million US Dollars. ProMED-mail apologizes for any
inconvenience caused by this error.
