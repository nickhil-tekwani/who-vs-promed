99/096 EU import prohibition of Egyptian potatoes
_Ralstonia solanacearum_ (EPPO A2 quarantine pest) [formerly known as
_Pseudomonas solanacearum_ -- see Mod.DH comment at end occurs in Egypt and
has repeatedly been found on Egyptian consignments of ware potatoes imported
into the European Union (see EPPO reports of intercepted consignments).
In order to avoid the introduction of this quarantine pest, particular
requirements concerning potato imports from Egypt were stated in Commission
Decision '96/301/EC authorizing Member States temporarily to take emergency
measures against the dissemination of _Pseudomonas solanacearum_ (Smith)
Smith as regards Egypt' and its amended versions. One of the main
requirements was that potatoes must have been produced in fields located in
approved 'pest-free areas' in Egypt.
However, large amounts of infected potatoes continued to be intercepted in
trade. An additional provision was made to the Commission Decision stating
that, as soon as
more than 5 interceptions of _Ralstonia solanacearum_ have been confirmed in
lots of potatoes introduced into the Community during the 1998/1999 import
season, potato imports would be prohibited. Attainment of this threshold was
considered to indicate that the method for the identification of 'pest-free
areas' or the procedures for official
monitoring in Egypt were not sufficient to prevent the risk of introduction.
On 1999-04-03, more than 5 interceptions of infected potatoes from Egypt had
been notified by EU Member States. The European Commission and the Standing
Committee on Plant Health decided that imports of Egyptian potatoes were
prohibited until the end of the season.

[Hopefully Egyptian authorities will ensure that future exports are free of
this pathogen. This might involve testing for the presence of the pathogen
in land to be used for potato production. Comments from those with knowledge
about the biology of _R. solanacearum_ in soil might be useful.
Bacterial wilt of potato caused by _R. solanacearum_ is the most serious
bacterial disease of potato in warm regions of the world. According to the
Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, it affects more
than 30 plant families, including potato, tobacco, tomato, eggplant and
chili.
The pathogen is often present as a latent infection in tubers which are used
for seed purposes. There is no effective chemical control of acterial wilt
of potato. Disease management practices include crop rotation, minimum
tillage, planting of tolerant cultivars, and general crop sanitation.
Note: _Ralstonia solanacearum_ is the approved new name for _Pseudomonas
solanacearum_. Validation of the new name was by publication of a note in
the
International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology in 1996. The Commission
Decision '96/301 used the old nomenclature which was in vogue at that time -
