Nkayi district in Matabeleland North Province has been hit by an
outbreak of anthrax. Veterinary Department Services sources in the
area said cases of the disease have been detected mainly in areas
adjacent to Gokwe where the disease is a perennial problem. The
sources, however, said so far no cases of human beings affected have
been reported.

"Cases of anthrax have been reported in cattle so far. We have not
established whether there have been people affected after eating meat
infected with anthrax bacteria. However, we would like to urge the
local people not to eat meat from animals, which have died on their
own. Such cases should be reported to our offices as soon as they are
discovered," said a veterinary services source in the area. The
official, who refused to be named, said the department is currently
experiencing acute shortages of vaccines for the vaccination of the
cattle where there is an outbreak.

"We need enough foreign currency to procure anthrax vaccines from
Botswana. The government recently procured some vaccines from China,
but all the stocks have run out," added the official who refused to
be named for fear of victimization.

The shortage of vaccines has resulted in the deaths of many cattle in
Masvingo, Midlands, and Matabeleland provinces, stifling the nation's
efforts to replenish its national herd decimated by the successive
draughts.

Efforts to get a comment from the director of the Veterinary
Services, Dr Stuart Huggrives were all in vain at the time of going
to press.

[Nkayi is between Gokwe and the Hwange National Park. This is the
early dry season in Zimbabwe. With the present hyperinflation in
Zimbabwe, absence of facilities, and unrest, I fear that it is not
unlikely that that the anthrax situation there will return to what it
was in 1980 with widespread human cases. It would be unusual if human
cases have not already occurred and in significant numbers. It has
been common in the past to see reports of 10 human cases per dead
bovine in this part of Africa.
