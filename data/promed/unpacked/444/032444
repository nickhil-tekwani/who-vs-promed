New threat to Isan [northeast region] rice fields
-------------------------------------------------
Though the recent floods have had a minimal impact on rice
plantations in the Northeast, the largest growing area in the
country, the region is facing a new threat from blast plant disease.

The disease is estimated to have damaged rice fields in provinces
including Ubon Ratchathani, Sakon Nakhon, and Amnat Charoen. Experts
are concerned that production of fragrant and glutinous rice, 2
prominent products in the Northeast, could fall.

In Ubon Ratchathani, blast disease has so far affected more that 64
000 ha [approx 158 000 acres] of paddy fields in the province alone,
said Sitthiporn Bangkaew, provincial Commercial Affairs Office.
Nearby provinces have also encountered the same problems. [Rice
blast] last hit area farms badly in 1983-84.

Laddawan Kunnoot, Rice Department, said the disease was detected 2
years ago and the department had been continuously advising farmers
not to overuse fertilisers. "But many whose farms were flooded have
tried to promote growth, which would be bad," Dr Laddawan said.

[Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Magnaporthe grisea_ (synonyms
_Pyricularia oryzae_, _P. grisea_). It is one of the most destructive
diseases of rice worldwide with potential yield losses of more than
50 percent. Symptoms include lesions on all parts of the shoot, stem
rot, and panicle blight. When nodes are infected, all plant parts
above the infection die and yield losses are severe. When infection
occurs at the seedling or tillering stages, plants are often
completely killed. More than 50 species of grasses and sedges can be
affected by different strains of the fungus, but most strains
isolated from rice can only infect a limited number of cultivars.

Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by
climatic conditions. The disease is also favoured by high nitrogen
levels (for example from fertilizers, as mentioned above) and high
humidity (which would likely be connected with the floods in Isan).
The disease is spread by infected plant debris, mechanical means
(including insect activity), water, and wind. Disease management may
include fungicides and cultural practices, but relies mainly on
resistant varieties. However, the fungus is highly variable and this
favours the emergence of new strains with increased virulence.

Earlier in 2010, rice crops in central Thailand were reported to be
affected by viruses (ProMED-mail post 20100628.2155).
