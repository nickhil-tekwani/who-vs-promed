The Argentine city of Bahia Blanca has warned its 420 000 residents to
avoid using tap water because it says it is laced with toxic bacteria that
cause skin irritation and possibly neurological damage.
"I've worked here for 25 years and I'd say this is the worst water crisis
I've ever seen here," city public health chief Ana Maria Reimers said on
Tuesday. Reimers said several cases of skin rashes had been linked to the
water. She quoted medical literature as saying the bacteria caused skin
irritation in the short term and if consumed in large enough quantities
could cause neurological damage.
Bahia Blanca, 420 miles (685 km) southwest of Buenos Aires, is Argentina's
main petrochemical production base and a leading agricultural center.
Residents first noticed a bad smell in their tap water on 10 Apr 2000.
Municipal official are waiting for test results they requested a week ago
from the city's water supply company.
