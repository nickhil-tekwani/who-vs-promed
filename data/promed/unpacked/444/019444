Eight camels that were illegally imported into Iran from Pakistan were infected with a coronavirus "potentially related" to MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus), Iranian authorities reported recently.

The 8 camels were among 186 camels that were tested at 2 border stations, the head of the Iran Veterinary Organization told the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) in a report submitted 13 Dec 2014 [see comment (1)].

Iran's Central Veterinary Laboratory tested nasal and mouth swabs from the camels, the report said. None of the animals died.

Iranian authorities told the OIE of similar findings in October 2014: a coronavirus "related to MERS coronavirus" in 3 of 18 camels that had been illegally imported from Pakistan.

Camels in several Middle Eastern and African countries have been found infected with MERS-CoV, and they are regarded as a probable source of human infections. It appears that there have been no previous reports of MERS-CoV infected camels in Iran [see comment (2)].

Iran had its 1st 5 human cases of MERS in a cluster from May to July of this year [2014].

[1. The Iranian follow-up report No. 3, submitted on Sun 13 Dec 2014 to the OIE, reported 2 "outbreaks" of MERS-CoV in camels illegally imported from Pakistan into Iran's Baluchistan province (bordering Iran on its east) and kept in 2 quarantine stations (their locations to be seen in the report's map). One batch, composed of 99 camels of which 3 were found positive (by RT-PCR test) was kept in the quarantine station at Zabol, Sistan-Baluchistan. The other batch, counting 87 camels of which 5 were reportedly positive by RT-PCR test, was kept in the quarantine station at Rigi, Mirjaveh, Sistan-Baluchistan. None of the positive camels died/was destroyed/was slaughtered.

Have any clinical signs been observed?

As "source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection," the OIE report states "Illegal movement of animals."

The report's epidemiological comments are: "Nasal and mouth swabs were taken from confiscated camels (illegally imported from Pakistan) and tested in Central Veterinary Laboratory. Camels are kept in the quarantine station."

The report, with interactive map, is available at
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=16747.

The chronology of these 2 "outbreaks" is in need of some clarification: the report states that both outbreaks started on 28 Oct 2014, while the date of the RT-PCR tests for both is given as 26 Oct 2014, and the report submitted to the OIE on 13 Dec 2014.

Do the 2 batches, reported as distinct outbreaks, represent smuggled consignments, intercepted in 2 separate locations/dates, or rather separately collected animals suspected to have been smuggled on separate dates and kept collectively in 2 quarantine stations?

How do the authorities distinguish between local and Pakistani camels?

2. Stating that "there have been no previous reports of MERS-CoV infected camels in Iran" is in need of some clarification. Have any tests for MERS-CoV been applied in local camels, namely dromedary camels born and grown in Iran? In case affirmative, how many, where, and when? Iran's camel population is reported to be around 160 000.

The positive findings in Pakistani camels are not known to have caused reported infections in humans in Iran, nor in animals (camels). Iran has reported 5 human cases during May-July 2014. None of them had a history of contact with animals or consumption of raw camel milk products in the 14 days prior to becoming ill.

For convenience, here is a summary of the 5 human cases in Iran, derived from ProMED-mail's postings:

Cases 1 & 2 (post 20140612.2534478):
Two sisters; no travel history. The 1st one (52) with history of close contact with a woman who had an influenza-like illness (ILI) and had travelled to Saudi Arabia to perform Umrah. The 2nd one (50) had close contact with her sister.

Case No. 3 (post 20140616.2541707):
35-year-old nurse assistant. Developed illness on 26 May 2014. Close contact to the 1st laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case (52, above).

Case No. 4 (post 20140704.2585758):
44-year-old male, national healthcare worker resident of Kerman province located in southeast Iran, reported to have had close contact on 26 May 2014 with a patient diagnosed with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) at the same hospital where he was working.

Case No. 5 (post 20140726.2637262):
No history of travel. No known contact with a previously reported MERS-CoV case. However, during her 1st hospitalisation, the patient had close contact with another patient with severe acute respiratory infection.

In view of the positive tests in Pakistani camels introduced to Iran, complementary information from Pakistan is requested. Pakistan's (dromedary) camel population is reportedly around one million, most of them in Baluchistan. As a major camel producer and an exporter, the health situation of camels in Pakistan, with special attention to zoonoses, deserves to be closely looked at. - Mod.AS
