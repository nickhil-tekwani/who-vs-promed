Equine piroplasmosis, New Zealand
-----------------------------
Information received on [and dated] Fri 22 May 2020 from Dr Tony Zohrab, Policy and Trade Branch, Ministry for Primary Industries, Wellington, New Zealand

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 22 Apr 2020
Date of confirmation of the event: 22 May 2020
Date submitted to OIE: 22 May 2020
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: _Theileria equi_
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (basic and advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country.

New outbreaks: 1
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Karaka, Auckland
Date of start of the outbreak: 22 Apr 2020
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Equidae / 120 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: a 4-year-old mare

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Equidae / 0.83 / 0 / 0 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: As part of routine testing for export, a 4-year-old mare tested positive on antibody ELISA for _Theileria equi_. The mare was previously imported into New Zealand in February 2019. While the horse met import testing requirements, preliminary investigations suggest that it was infected with _T. equi_ when it was imported. The affected mare is under voluntary movement restrictions. Transmission of equine piroplasmosis is primarily through a competent tick vector. New Zealand has no confirmed vectors for _T. equi_. For the period the mare has been resident in New Zealand, all contact animals, where it is feasible for iatrogenic transmission (through blood) to occur, are being traced and tested.

Control measures
Measures applied: traceability, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type:
New Zealand National Animal Health Laboratory (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Equidae / competitive ELISA (c-ELISA) / 30 Apr 2020 / positive
Equidae / gene sequencing / 22 May 2020 / positive
Equidae / indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test / 7 May 2020 / positive
Equidae / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 22 May 2020 / positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[According to the latest information available in OIE WAHID, New Zealand has reported equine piroplasmosis as a disease "never reported" in the country. The 6-monthly report for the period January-June 2019 is available at https://tinyurl.com/ycr7qz33. Refer to section 2 of the report.

"Equine piroplasmosis is a tick-borne protozoal disease of horses, mules, donkeys, and zebra. The aetiological agents are blood parasites named _Theileria equi_ and _Babesia caballi_. Infected animals may remain carriers of these parasites for long periods and act as sources of infection for ticks, which act as vectors.

The introduction of carrier animals into areas where tick vectors are prevalent can lead to an epizootic spread of the disease." Source: http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.05.08_EQUINE_PIROPLASMOSIS.pdf.

As is noted in the epidemiological comment, "New Zealand has no confirmed vectors for _T.equi_. For the period the mare has been resident in New Zealand, all contact animals, where it is feasible for iatrogenic transmission (through blood) to occur, are being traced and tested." - Mod.CRD
