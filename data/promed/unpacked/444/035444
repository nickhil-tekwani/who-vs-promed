[Bluetongue is a seasonal disease in the area, with the occurrence
picking up in June or July and the season ending in October or
November generally, when frost inhibits the _Culicoides_ species insect vector.

Morocco recently had a mixed BT-4 and BT-1 infection, while Algeria
had a BT1 outbreak declared complete last February [2010], the same
month a new BT-4 was reported as an outbreak in Algeria. So, it would
not be completely surprising to find updates of the situation which
include reports of BT-1.

The outbreak area can be seen on the map appended at the end of the
OIE WAHID report referenced above or at the Healthmap Interactive
website. - Mod.PC]
