Hantavirus infection kills airman at Texas army base
----------------------------------------------------
The airmen thought the dead mice in their quarters at the Texas Army base
were amusing. The Air Force service members teased each other, according to
one airman's account, dangling or tossing the tiny corpses for laughs and
joking about the visible mouse droppings. Until a fellow airman died on 11
Feb 2006.

An autopsy found he died from hantavirus infection, which is transmitted
through the urine, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents. The military
reported the cause of death on Fri Friday [24 Feb 2006], withholding the
man's name for reasons of privacy and noting it was unclear where he
contracted the virus infection.

A serviceman on base, communicating through a family member, confirmed the
man was a 24 year old senior airman from Arizona. Obituaries from earlier
this month confirm that the airman died while on temporary assignment at
Fort Bliss near El Paso, Texas.

Clarence Davis III, a spokesman for the William Beaumont Army Medical
Center where the airman died, said 7 service members had been admitted
there since Friday with "symptoms of viral illness." So far 4 have tested
negative for hantavirus, with results pending for the 3 others. In the
Friday statement, Fort Bliss officials confirmed they are taking "several
precautions" to ensure safety, including cleaning buildings that house troops.

The specific hantavirus [associated with pulmonary disease in the USA] was
identified in 1993, when an outbreak occurred in the Four Corners area of
the United States. Since then there have been 416 US cases -- 20 to 30 per
year, according to Abbigail Tumpey, spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. The strain most commonly found in the this country
is often called "Sin Nombre"," or "no name," virus, and is carried by the
deer mouse. More than a third of those who contract it die.

Common disinfectants can kill the hantavirus, but if particles disperse --
by sweeping up droppings, for example -- they can be inhaled. While the
incubation period can last from a few days to several weeks, death is often
swift. The _Sin Nombre virus_ causes a pulmonary syndrome [hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome], in which the blood vessels leak fluid into the lungs
so the victim can't breathe.

[Hantavirus infection is contracted from rodent detritus in the
environment. Infection is not transmitted from person-to-person. A brief
account of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome {HPS) and a photograph of a deer
mouse can be viewed at

and up-to-date account of hantaviruses and HPS in general is available in
the form of a set of 43 PowerPoint slides entitled "All about
hantaviruses," prepared by the Special Pathogens Branch of the US CDC and
