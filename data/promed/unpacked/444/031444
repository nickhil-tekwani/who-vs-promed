Vesicular stomatitis (VS) update: 7 Colorado quarantines
--------------------------------------------------------
Guidelines for livestock shows, fairs, exhibitions, and events

The Colorado Department of Agriculture's State Veterinarian's Office has placed 7 locations under quarantine after horses tested positive for vesicular stomatitis (VS). The quarantines are located in Weld and Boulder counties; results on additional tests in other counties are pending. [The rest is just a repetition of instructions and advice that we have seen over previous days without any further details on cases and premises. - Mod.MHJ]

[The state of can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=2635262,209. To find Boulder County in Colorado, go to http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/colorado_90.jpg; it is just north west of Denver and at the south west corner of Weld County.

As was suspected yesterday (23 Jul 2014), the continuing investigation and visits to farms in these 2 counties, Boulder and Weld, have revealed more infected horses. This will continue until the 1st frost so we can expect a significant number of establishments and horses will have been affected by the autumn, unless they initiate aerial spraying. - Mod.MHJ]
