Eighteen (ages 3-80) of 200 people in a small community of several hamlets
in Morocco have died of a bronchial disease between 26 January and 3
February, authorities said on Thursday. Doctors and medical supplies have
been sent to the district in Figuig province in eastern Morocco on the
border with Algeria, an Interior Ministry department said in a statement. A
campaign of disease prevention has begun and the provincial governor,
councilors and security officials have gone to the area.

[Sort of difficult to prevent a disease with unknown etiology. If anyone
in Morocco or elsewhere has information about this cluster of cases, please
let us know. By the way, a hamlet is a small group of houses, not large
enough to be called a village or town. - Mod.CHC]
