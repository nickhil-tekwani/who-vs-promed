On 8/27/98, ProMED-mail [reported that Dr. Seth W. Wright wrote:
"And over the last two decades, the proportion of cases in adolescents and
adults rose from 15.1% to 26.9%, he writes."
This sentence implies that adults are increasingly susceptible to
pertussis, or that the overall rate of infection in adults is rising. This
may be true, or it may be false. As the summary states, "many diagnoses
are missed," and this rising proportion could be due to more vigilant
diagnosis and reporting, as more doctors come to recognize that pertussis
is not (and may never have been) a disease confined to children. (The
sentence could just have easily been written to say: "the proportion of
cases in children declined from 84.9% to 73.1%." Since the disease is
life-threatening to children, shall we rejoice?)
Also, omitted in the summary is any reference to the fact that the number
of reported US cases of pertussis peaks in roughly three-to-four-year
cycles. "Has been rising since" implies by omission a straight diagonal
rise in the graph.
