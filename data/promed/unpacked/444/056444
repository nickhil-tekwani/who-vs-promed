Health Ministry decides against general smallpox inoculation
-----------------------------------------
Health Ministry Director-General Boaz Lev announced Wednesday afternoon
that the ministry is recommending that the general population not be
inoculated against smallpox at this stage.
In a discussion held Tuesday night evening attended by members of the
public authority that formulates health policy in emergency situations,
most of the participants argued that there is no reason to vaccinate the
general population at this stage. However, participants noted that the
final decision will be made by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon on the basis of
intelligence information.
Health Ministry officials have a number of options regarding smallpox
vaccinations. It can vaccinate the general population; it can authorize
voluntary vaccination for those interested; or it can concentrate on the
estimated 2 million to 2.8 million people who have never been vaccinated.
It appears that if a decision is reached to launch a broad vaccination
campaign, priority will be given to those already inoculated. This group
constitutes an estimated 3 million persons.
About 4 months ago, the security-political cabinet accepted the Health
Ministry's recommendation to vaccinate 15 000 - 20 000 security and medical
personnel who could come in contact with biological weapons in the event of
an attack.

Israel Decides Against General Smallpox Inoculation
-----------------------------
Israel's Health Ministry said on Wednesday it had decided for now against
inoculating the general public for the deadly smallpox virus despite
mounting fears of a U.S. war on Iraq. But the ministry said it would
expand a program to inoculate thousands more rescue and emergency workers.
"At this stage we have not decided to inoculate the general public, but we
did agree to open up the inoculation of the first response teams as far as
possible," said Ido Hadari, a spokesman for the Health Ministry.
Hadari said the ministry made the decision because there was no additional
intelligence on Iraq's potential to use smallpox as a weapon against Israel
in response to any U.S. strike.
Israel has already vaccinated 15 000 emergency workers against the
highly-infectious smallpox, with few side effects. "There are thousands
more rescue workers...it can reach up to 100 000 people," Hadari said,
citing firefighters, hospital and clinic staff, police and army
personnel. The program is currently voluntary.
Advocates against a mass inoculation note that the vaccine itself can cause
severe side effects or even death in a few cases, and that such a program
can spread unnecessary panic.
In a sign of the mounting concern, 2 leading Israeli healthcare providers
opened a hotline this week for anxious citizens to answer their questions
on smallpox and the vaccine.
Babies born in Israel were inoculated against smallpox until 1980, when the
disease was declared defunct worldwide, and all Israeli military conscripts
were vaccinated until 1996. About half of Israel's population of 6 million
people are estimated to have received the inoculation at some time in their
lives.
"There is no new information (about a threatened outbreak of the disease),
and we are doing everything to be ready for a situation in which we can
inoculate the entire public within a few days if necessary," Hadari
said. "Once we have our first response teams inoculated and a contingency
plan (for the wider public), we can feel quite safe," he said.
Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at Israel during the U.S.-led 1991 Gulf War,
resulting in one death and few other casualties. Iraq denies developing
weapons of mass destruction.
But Israel now fears that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein may have equipped any
remaining missiles with chemical and biological agents, though some
infectious disease experts doubt that the smallpox virus could be packed
into a warhead.

[Consistent with the above-stated decision, recent reports on vaccination
strategies have been focusing on (re)vaccinating non-naive individuals,
thereby reducing the risk of adverse events from the vaccine. A report
released this week (Epstein JM, Cummings DAT, Chakravarty S, Singa RM,
Burke DS; Toward a Containment Strategy for Smallpox Bioterror: An
Individual-Based Computational Approach) by the Brookings Institute in the
USA, while focused on modeling for a containment strategy for a smallpox
outbreak, discusses a "pre-emptive" vaccination of with a history of prior
successful smallpox vaccination as "this group is highly unlikely to suffer
any of the side effects emphasized above (the report discussed the known
adverse events associated with the current smallpox vaccine)".
(<http://www.brook.edu/dybdocroot/es/dynamics/papers/bioterrorism.htm>)
In the absence of known circulation of the smallpox virus (variola virus),
efforts to reduce adverse events associated with the currently available
smallpox vaccines (vaccinia virus) seem prudent, while efforts focused on
research and development of a newer and safer vaccine should maintain a
high priority. - Mod.MPP]
