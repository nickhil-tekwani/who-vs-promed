Rozzano is a town in the Metropolitan City of Milan in the Italian region of Lombardy; Rozzano is located about 9 km (6 mi) south of Milan (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rozzano). A map showing the location of the school the 6-year-old attended on Via Garofani in Rozzano can be found at https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Via+Garofani,+20089+Rozzano+MI,+Italy. Bergamo, where the child died, is a city in Lombardy, northern Italy, about 40 km (25 mi) northeast of Milan (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergamo).

Although the news report does not mention the microbial etiology of the meningitis that killed the 6-year-old, it was likely _Neisseria meningitidis_, for which antibiotic chemoprophylaxis is given to close contacts.
