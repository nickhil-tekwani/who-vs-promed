A new study published today [1 Nov 2010] is urging authorities to
increase surveillance of bats to fight against a virus similar to
rabies. Experts in Geneva and Lausanne say that while dog rabies has
been eradicated in most mammals in western Europe, a low level of
this related disease remains in bat populations.

The specialists say the virus is only present in a small proportion
of bats and that risks for humans are low as long as they don't
handle the animals.

But results from the 2 percent of bats tested suggest greater
monitoring would be a good idea.

In Western Europe, canine rabies is no longer a problem in
terrestrial mammals, but another type of virus belonging to the same
family of viruses [the _Rhabdoviridae_] is present in bats. Although
prevalence is low, enhanced surveillance is prudent. European bats
can harbour 2 species of lyssaviruses, designated European bat
lyssavirus 1 (EBLV-1) and European bat lyssavirus 2 (EBLV-2).
Researchers at the University of Lausanne and the Centre for
Protection of Bats have published a study of the prevalence and
epidemiology of these viruses in the journal Archives of Virology
[Surveillance for European bat lyssavirus in Swiss bats. A. Megali,
G. Yannic, M.-L. Zahno, D. Brugger and G. Bertoni, et al., Arch
Virol. 2010 Oct;155(10):1655-62. Epub 2010 Aug 28.

The Abstract and extracts from their paper are reproduced below:

Abstract: "Most countries in Western Europe are currently free of
rabies in terrestrial mammals. Nevertheless, rabies remains a
residual risk to public health due to the natural circulation of
bat-specific viruses, such as European bat lyssaviruses (EBLVs).
European bat lyssavirus types 1 and 2 (EBLV-1 and EBLV-2) are widely
distributed throughout Europe, but little is known of their true
prevalence and epidemiology. We report that only 3 out of 837 brains
taken from bats submitted to the Swiss Rabies Centre between 1976 and
2009 were found by immunofluorescence (FAT) to be positive for EBLVs.
All 3 positive cases were in _Myotis daubentoni_, from 1992, 1993 and
2002. In addition to this passive surveillance, we undertook a
targeted survey in 2009, aimed at detecting lyssaviruses in live bats
in Switzerland. A total of 237 bats of the species _M. daubentoni_,
_Myotis myotis_, _Eptesicus serotinus_ and _Nyctalus noctula_ were
captured at different sites in western Switzerland.

Oropharyngeal swabs and blood from each individual were analysed by
RT-PCR and rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT),
respectively. RNA corresponding to EBLV-2 was detected from
oropharyngeal swabs of a single _M. daubentoni_ bat, but no
infectious virus was found. Molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed
that the corresponding sequence was closely related to the other
EBLV-2 sequences identified in previous rabies isolates from Swiss
bats (particularly to that found at Geneva in 2002). Three _M.
daubentoni_ bats were found to be seropositive by RFFIT. In
conclusion, even though the prevalence is low in Switzerland,
continuous management and surveillance are required to assess the
potential risk to public health."

The authors' conclusions are: "Overall, the results of this study
suggest that the public-health risk of infection with EBLV is
moderate to low in Switzerland. Nonetheless, the practice of
considering rabies in both humans and animals with a course of
progressive encephalitis, also in the absence of a known history of
exposure, must be maintained and ensured. The risk of cross-species
transmission to both humans and animals is highest in clinically
diseased, disoriented animals with bizarre behaviour. EBLV-1 has not
been detected in any of the bats sampled, and EBLV-2 seems to be
present only at a very low prevalence. However, with the present
confirmation of EBLV-2 infection in Daubenton's bats, and considering
the biased sampling, the epidemic picture of EBLV in Switzerland
remains incomplete. Therefore, both active and passive surveillance
must be intensified in order to assess more appropriately the
potential risk to public health."

[The following are some relevant extracts from the authors'
Discussion: "Both the detection of neutralizing antibodies in blood
samples, indicating past exposure to EBLV, and the detection of viral
RNA in oropharyngeal swabs suggest recent active circulation of EBLV
in Swiss Daubenton's bats, confirming the potential for disease
spread. Not a single bat from the 3 other species sampled (Serotine
bat, Noctule bat and Great mouse-eared bat) gave a positive reaction
by serology or RT-PCR. Out of the 3 seropositive Daubenton's bats,
one was found positive with CVS [challenge virus standard] rabies as
challenge virus, probably due to serological cross- reactivity with
EBLVs. The other 2 samples were positive with EBLV-2b but not with
CVS, indicating higher sensitivity of the neutralization test when
using EBLV as the challenge virus.

The seroprevalence over the different Daubenton's bats was 2.4
percent (3 of 24 bats tested), whereas the prevalence estimated by
RT-PCR was lower, with 0.7 percent of individuals reacting positively
(1/148). The low prevalence found in this work seems to be in
accordance with the north-to-south gradient in the frequency of EBLVs
detected in Western Europe using classical techniques for viral
detection [47]. In Scotland, a seroprevalence of 0.05-3.8 percent has
been detected while screening _M. daubentoni_ [48]. In a recent
active survey in England, a seroprevalence of 1.0-4.1 percent was
found, while no virus was detected using both RT-PCR and RTCIT in 363
_M. daubentoni_ bats sampled [46].

EBLV-1 is the most common virus found across northern and central
Europe as far east as Russia, and in western European countries as
far south as Spain (reviewed in ref. [49]). Germany and the
Netherlands are the only countries in which both EBLV-1 and EBLV-2
have been detected. EBLV-1 has a specific association with the
serotine bat as the main vector, but it has also been reported in
greater mouse-eared bats in Spain [50, 51] and in noctule bats in
Germany [52]. Although serotine bats, noctule bats and greater
mouse-eared bats are frequently found across Switzerland ([53] and
Centre Suisse de Cartographie de la Faune, Neuchatel), few samples
have been analysed, and none were found positive in the present
study. In view of regular cases encountered in serotine bats both in
France and Germany [13, 54], this infection may have been missed in
both passive and active surveillance so far due to the limited number
of individuals tested and the biased distribution of sampling."

Interested readers should consult the Archives of Virology paper for
the data and the literature references.
