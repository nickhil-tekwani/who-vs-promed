A bovine tuberculosis (TB) positive herd has been found in Alpena County, [Michigan]. The disease was confirmed in one of the animals from this herd on 10 Nov 2020, the Michigan Department of Agriculture & Rural Development said on Mon 16 Nov 2020.

Additional testing will be done in the herd, as well as an investigation to rule out the possibility of additional cases stemming from the affected herd.

Bovine TB is a bacterial disease that can affect all mammals, including humans. It is known to be present in the free-ranging deer population in parts of northeastern lower Michigan, and the disease can be transmitted between deer and cattle.

Today [16 Nov 2020], state veterinarian Nora Wineland released the following statement due to the discovery of a bovine tuberculosis (TB) positive herd in Alpena County:

"Bovine TB was recently confirmed to be present in an Alpena County beef herd, located in Michigan's Modified Accredited Zone. On 10 Nov 2020, the National Veterinary Services Laboratories confirmed the presence of the disease in one of the animals from this herd. As with all new findings of bovine TB in a cattle herd, additional testing will be done in the herd, and an epidemiological investigation has been started to rule out the possibility of additional cases stemming from the affected herd.

"Bovine TB is a bacterial disease affecting all mammals, including humans. It is known to be present in the free-ranging white-tailed deer population in specific areas of northeastern lower Michigan, and the disease can be transmitted between deer and cattle. While state and federal agencies are taking significant steps to manage the disease, the continued hunting of deer in this area is an important tool in maintaining a healthy deer population.

"The Alpena County herd is Michigan's 80th cattle herd to be identified with bovine TB since 1998. In addition, it is the 3rd TB-infected cattle herd to be identified in the Modified Accredited Zone (MAZ) in the previous 12 months. Under a Memorandum of Understanding with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), if there are more than 3 TB-infected cattle herds identified within the MAZ during a 12-month period, then the State of Michigan and USDA must enter discussions on the issue. These discussions may result in changes being made to the TB program requirements or to the status or boundaries of the MAZ.

"This finding underscores the need for cattle producers to work to protect their herds from TB, and the continued collaboration of producers and deer hunters is vital to reduce deer numbers and deer pressure in order to better control the disease."

["Bovine tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic bacterial disease (primarily of cattle) caused by the microorganism _Mycobacterium bovis_. The disease can affect other species, including humans and wildlife.

"Bovine TB is most often transmitted to humans by inhalation of aerosolized respiratory tract bacteria, ingestion of unpasteurized milk, and inoculation by contaminated instruments (such as knives). The disease can be spread from livestock to wildlife or wildlife to livestock via the fecal-oral route, ingestion of contaminated food, or though the respiratory tract.

"The APHIS Bovine TB Eradication Program has reduced TB in US cattle; however, spillover into wildlife may maintain the microorganism in the environment and function as a source of re-infection for livestock.

"Bovine tuberculosis in wildlife was 1st documented in the United States in white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) in 1933. They continue to be the wildlife species of most concern because they are known to become infected and transmit bovine TB via the oral or respiratory route and are considered reservoirs in some areas. Other wildlife and feral species in North America in which _M. bovis_ has been detected include:

- elk (_Cervus canadensis_)
- mule deer (_Odocoileus hemionus_)
- bison (_Bison bison_)
- raccoons (_Procyon lotor_)
- moose (_Alces alces_)
- coyotes (_Canis latrans_)
- opossums (_Didelphis virginiana_)
- feral cats (_Felis silvestris catus_)
- gray fox (_Urocyon cinereoargenteus_)
- black bears (_Ursus americanus_)
- feral swine (_Sus scrofa_)
- gray wolves (_Canis lupus_)
- red fox (_Vulpes vulpes_)
- bobcat (_Lynx rufus_)

"Active surveillance for TB in wildlife is currently being conducted only in Michigan and Minnesota, where the disease has been documented in white-tailed deer. However, surveillance in wildlife is often conducted in other areas of the United States following the detection of bovine TB in domestic livestock or captive cervids. These short-term surveillance programs are usually established to evaluate whether bovine TB is present in wildlife on or near infected premises."

There is no recognized treatment for bovine tuberculosis in bovines or wildlife. The treatment would be the same as for human beings, but it is a long, extended process and is too costly and, therefore, is not economically feasible in bovines or wildlife. - Mod.TG
