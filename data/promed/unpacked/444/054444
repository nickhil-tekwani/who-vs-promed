[2] Cholera - Yemen: (Hajjah)
Date: Mon 18 Feb 2008

<http://yementimes.com/article.shtml?i=1130&p=health&a=1>


Cholera is threatening the lives of citizens in Hajjah governorate's
Bani Qais district. Bani Qais locals say they are being threatened by
cholera, with the epidemic having killed 40 area residents since late
2007. Local council member Sheikh Yahya Hafja stated, "This disaster
is a tragedy. I appeal to concerned authorities and both local and
international organizations to intervene quickly to stem this problem."

Although Yahya Ghailan, head of the Epidemic Surveillance Department,
was on vacation, he agreed to comment on the situation, explaining
that the disease first appeared in the district in October 2007,
beginning in Mistaba, northern Hajjah and a district on the
Yemeni-Saudi border, before moving on to Bani Qais and Khairan
districts. "3 children from the same family, ages 5, 8, and 10, died
of cholera on 15 Dec 2007," Ghailan noted, adding that the Bani Qais
Health Department has recorded 16 deaths since the disease's
appearance in the district. "The problem still exists, with the most
recent death being a female on 27 Jan 2008," he added.

A Bani Qais health worker requesting anonymity said 40 deaths have
been observed due to cholera, with the main reason being water
contamination, adding that Health Department records are inaccurate
because several deaths have occurred at home. However, health worker
Ali Ahmed denies the existence of the disease, maintaining that
talking about it will affect tourism in that area.

[3] Diarrhea, fatal - Philippines

Some 31 Filipinos, mostly children, die everyday from diarrhea due to
poor sanitation, according to a recent study of the World Bank (WB)
and United States Agency for International Development (USAID).

The report cited the Philippines Statistical Yearbook 2008 as stating
high incidence of diarrhea cases of more than 38 million per year
leads to the premature deaths of 31 Filipinos a day.

The report said 27 million Filipinos do not have toilets and are at
risk of ingesting human fecal material. The health impacts of water
pollution and poor sanitation and hygiene come from contact with
human waste through ingestion.

The World Bank report said some 13 million Filipinos do not have
improved water sources, and only 3.3 percent of the households are
connected to sewers leading to the treatment facilities. Access to
basic sanitation is 20 percent lower for low-income households, while
access to water supply is 17 percent lower, said Rahul Raturi, World
Bank sector manager for environment and rural development. The Bank
said more than 95 percent of the wastewater in urban areas is
deposited untreated into groundwater, canals, and waterways.

[4] Cholera - Kenya: (Northeastern)
Date: Mon 18 Feb 2008

<http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=76804>


An outbreak of cholera in Kenya's Mandera district has claimed the
lives of 6 people, with the local hospital reporting that about 130
people had sought treatment at the facility during the past week
[11-17 Feb 2008]. About 60 patients have been admitted to the
hospital, a medical officer from the Mandera District Hospital, who
asked not to be named, said, adding that the hospital had asked for
more cholera treatment drugs from Garissa, the provincial capital of
the Northeastern Province, where Mandera is situated.

Abukar Abdi, public health officer for Mandera, said the outbreak
could be the result of general poor hygiene in Mandera town or the
use of contaminated water from the nearby Dawa River, which forms
part of the border between Kenya and Ethiopia. He said his office had
ordered 25 food kiosks in Mandera town to close down due to poor hygiene.

[5] Cholera - Kenya: (Northeastern)

<http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=48267>


Since the outbreak was reported in January 2008, 8 people have died
from cholera in Mandera; 5 of the victims succumbed at Mandera
District Hospital while 3 others perished at Bulla Hawa Hospital on
the Kenya-Somalia border.

Northeastern provincial public health officer Dr Bernard Nyongesa
said the outbreak had spread to Elwak 175 km (109 mi) away. He said
it had become difficult to control the spread of the disease due to
lax immigration checks at Bula Hawa at the Kenya-Somalia and at Suftu
at the Kenya-Ethiopia borders. Dr Nyongesa said the situation was
made worse by the lack of health facilities in the area.

Following an outbreak of diarrhea with vomiting, 5 children have been
reported dead and over 50 are receiving treatment in various
hospitals at Amafor West area of Nkpor, an outskirts of Onitsha, Anambra State.

A medical practitioner in the area, Ndubuisi Donatus Uzoigwe, who
confirmed the outbreak to newsmen, said there were no primary health
care center or health workers to enlighten the parents on the dangers
of the disease.

Uzoigwe, proprietor of Ndubuisi Health Care Services Centre, said he
had already drawn the attention of various government health agencies
at both local and state levels to the alarming rate of the endemic
outbreak of diarrhea with vomiting which hit the area since January 2008.

[7] Cholera - Zimbabwe: (Mashonaland East, Mashonaland Central)

So far, 7 people from Nyamukuyo Village in Mudzi district,
Mashonaland East Province, have died of cholera. The minister of
Health and Child Welfare, Dr David Parirenyatwa, confirmed the
outbreak, which started 2 weeks ago.

Dr Parirenyatwa said a woman who had visited Mozambique was suspected
to have carried the disease to the village. This is the 2nd reported
cholera outbreak in February 2008 after a similar outbreak in
Muzarabani [in Mashonaland Central Province - Mod.LL], where 4 people
died last week [4-10 Feb 2008]. In a separate interview, principal
director for preventive services in the Ministry of Health, Dr Gibson
Mhlanga, attributed the increase of cholera and diarrhea cases in the
country to unsafe water and inadequate sanitation.
