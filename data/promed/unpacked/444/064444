A disease that affects birds has popped up in southern Illinois. House finch disease is a bird form of what we call "pink eye" in humans. It can blind the birds that get it and if you have a back yard feeder you may be helping to spread it.

[A resident] of Jackson County has a good look at his bird feeder from his kitchen. At the start of the year he noticed something wrong. "I started taking a few pictures and bring those up close and I could see that around the eyes there was something, looking like pink eye," he explains.

He photographs wildlife as a hobby. He's taken pictures of several birds with the disease in the last few weeks [Jan-Feb 2013]. "You could see their eyes, feathers were starting to fall out and around the eye it became inflamed," says the man.

The birds eventually go blind, making it hard for them to survive. The 1st cases of the disease were on the east coast in the 1990s and spread across the nation.

"House finches tend to congregate. Particularly, where there is a very good food source like many feeders or feeders that are up very consistently," says Melanie Driscoll of the National Audubon Society. "The number of house finches may get very large."

Driscoll says when more birds are in one area, disease is more likely to spread. That's why she and bird enthusiasts want others to watch for signs of the disease and keep their feeders clean in hopes of keeping the disease at bay.

The Audubon Society says when a diseased bird is found, the feeder needs to be taken down so the birds move to a different area. And the feeder and the area underneath need to be cleaned thoroughly.

[_Mycoplasma gallisepticum_ (MG) frequently causes disease in commercial chicken and turkey flocks, but it had never been reported in house finches or any songbird before 1994, suggesting that the epidemic began when MG expanded its host range from poultry to this phylogenetically distant songbird. A picture of the typical eye lesion caused by MG can be accessed at http://media.wsiltv.com/images/BirdDisease.jpg.
