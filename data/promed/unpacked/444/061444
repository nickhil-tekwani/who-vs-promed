[In response to internal queries as to the source of the initial
communication, I replied, "I picked this up off FISNET, which had lifted it
from UPI. It struck me as one of those [Pennsylvania University PR
releases but if true not all that surprising as faeces has a bad habit of
getting into drinking water." To which Andre Burnens informatively

From: Burnens Andre <andre.burnens@vbi.unibe.ch>

Despite numerous attempts by several investigators, there are only two
reports on successful isolation of _live_ _H. pylori_ from faeces in the
literature, one on children in Gambia (Thomas JE et al. Lancet (1992)
340:1194-5) and so far the most convincing in the U.K. (Kelly SM et al.
Gastroenterology (1994) 107:1671-4). However, _H. pylori_ are sensitive to
bile, and the intestinal contents as well as the colonic flora appear to be
hostile to them. Given the apparent fragility of _H. pylori_, their
persistence in the environment is even more surprising.
