While coronavirus has been at the forefront of our minds, some parts of Australia are experiencing an outbreak of a different illness. An explosion in mosquito numbers has seen a surge in the number of people being infected with Ross River virus.

It's a condition that can be debilitating and for some it takes years to recover.

And even with the onset of winter just weeks away, experts say many of us need to be on guard to prevent a potentially infectious mosquito bite.

[The number of cases of Ross River virus infection is not given the above report, other than the mention of a surge of cases. Ross River virus transmission has been active again this season in Australia. Ross River virus [RRV] infections occur sporadically across Australia when rains are heavy. RRV infection cases occur at times in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, and Western Australia.

Common symptoms of Ross River virus infection include fever, joint pain, and feeling tired and generally unwell. There are no effective treatments available for RRV. While most people recover after 2-3 weeks, some cases are very serious and can leave lingering problems such as arthritis in small joints, like those in the hands and feet, that can persist for weeks, making normal movement difficult.

Ross River virus is a zoonotic alphavirus transmitted by a wide range of mosquitoes, including _Aedes_ and _Culex_ species. The recommendations mentioned above should be adopted by individuals living in or visiting hot spots where transmission is occurring. - Mod.TY
