Rabies kills victim who denied having rabies
--------------------------------------------
A 38 year old mother of 3 in Brgy. Botong, Badiangan town died on 8 Jan
2011, the 1st recorded person to die of rabies here this year. The woman,
together with her sister, was bitten by a puppy, about 3 months old, on 22
Jun 2010. Her sister had shots of an anti-rabies vaccine, but the victim
did not. According to Estifania Gigare, provincial rabies coordinator for
Iloilo, the victim "hesitated to seek medication right after she was
bitten. Even before she died, she denied having rabies," said Gigare over a
telephone interview.

The victim was already having aerophobia and hydrophobia when she was
brought to the Federico Roman Tirador Sr. Memorial District Hospital in
Janiuay town on 8 Jan 2011, Gigare said. The victim complained of body
pains on 1 Jan 2011 and had paresthesia on 4 Jan 2011. On 6 Jan 2011, the
patient suffered from severe pain on her right leg and the next day, she
had difficulty swallowing, Gigare added. Symptoms of rabies infection,
according to Gigare, are fever, headache, general weakness and discomfort.
If these symptoms manifest in the patient, he or she may die, she said.

Meanwhile, passive and active vaccines [immunoglobulin and vaccine] were
already injected to the members of the victim's family who were believed
also to have been exposed to the virus. Among these family members were the
woman's 69 year old father, 30 year old husband, and her 2 year old
daughter. Previously, her 2 other older children and her mother had been
subjected to pre-exposure treatment.

A total of about 1 million peso [about 22 500 USD] has been allocated by
the provincial government for the purchase of anti-rabies vaccine for all
Animal Bite Centers in this province. Half of the budget has already been
released; the remaining amount will be released sometime this month,
according to Gov. Arthur Defensor Sr.

The Provincial Health Office also requested from the Department of Health,
Center for Health Development in Western Visayas, additional vials of
anti-rabies vaccine. Defensor said rabies is among the priority health
concerns of the province, adding that he wanted dog owners to be
responsible. "If we need to put our dogs in a cage, then let's do it. Let
us learn to be responsible dog owners and once and for all, let us avoid
eating dog meat," the governor stressed.

He also said people bitten by dogs and other animals must not hesitate in
seeking early medical treatment from the nearest hospital. "We are making
our hospitals really for the poor ... if patients cannot afford the
medication, there are many government agencies that can help them," said
Defensor.

[This incident illustrates in dramatic fashion both the efficacy of prompt
post-exposure prophylaxis and the folly of delay. It further emphasizes the
need for education of the population in proper husbandry of the domestic
dog population.
