The dangerous plant pathogen _Xylella fastidiosa_ has infected at least 14 vineyards across the island [and] is now threatening Mallorca's wine industry. The contagious disease has already infected hundreds of olive and almond trees. At present the outbreaks are restricted to small, private vineyards. If the disease is confirmed on large wine producing estates the results could be catastrophic for the island's wine industry.

EU scientists recently left Mallorca after evaluating the damage done to olive trees. They concluded that it will be necessary to cull and burn thousands of trees in order to stave off the spread of the disease. Ecologists revealed that the bacteria may have been festering on Mallorca for up to 10 years. Earlier action may have prevented what is almost certain to be a disastrous few years for olive, almond, and potentially wine producers.

[_Xylella fastidiosa_ (Xf) clogs the xylem of plants leading to wilting, necrosis, and often death. It causes many serious crop diseases such as Pierce's disease of grapevine; leaf scorch of coffee, almond, and olive; peach phony disease; plum leaf scald; citrus variegated chlorosis; lucerne dwarf; leaf scorch of a range of other woody species. Latent infections of wild species as potential pathogen reservoirs have also been reported. While all strains of _Xylella_ have been classified into a single species, several subspecies have been proposed and more research is needed to determine their host range and risks to crops.

Xf is spread by xylem-feeding insects, but also by grafting and with infected plant material. It is not seed borne. Moist conditions favour the vectors and therefore Xf-associated diseases. Disease management is difficult due to the large numbers of hosts and vectors and may include use of clean planting and grafting material, as well as vector control. Both the bacterium and its main vectors are of serious quarantine concern. The pathogen has been added to the A1 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

Xf had previously been reported mainly from the Americas. In 2013, it was reported for the 1st time from Taiwan (on grapevine; ProMED-mail post 20130806.1866205), and was also detected in Europe on olives in Italy (ProMED-mail posts 20131101.2033095, 20140820.2708739, and 20140424.2425497). It seems likely that that outbreak represents the 1st report of the pathogen in the European region. Recently, Xf subsp. _fastidiosa_, the cause of Pierce's disease of grapevine, was reported for the 1st time from Europe (Germany, ProMED-mail post 20160802.4387487). For Spain, the Balearic Islands were the site for the first reports of Xf (ProMED-mail post 20161125.4653479), as well as the grapevine strain (ProMED-mail post 20161208.4685744).

It was thought initially that the European incursion was due to contaminated imports of plant material. However, the detection of multiple subspecies in a diversity of hosts, including some asymptomatic ornamentals acting as reservoir host, now suggests a much more complex scenario, which may have global implications on plant quarantine. Xf is currently considered the most serious phytosanitary threat to European grape and fruit production. Research on pathogen distribution, strains, host range, and potential vectors in the region has been given high priority.
