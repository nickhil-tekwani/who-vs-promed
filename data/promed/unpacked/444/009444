Christian group reports chemical attack in Myanmar
-------------------------------------
A London-based Christian human rights group says it has collected
strong evidence of a chemical attack on Karen rebels by Myanmar's
military government, which denied the allegation on Friday.
Christian Solidarity Worldwide (CSW) said it had examined 5 rebels
who detailed the attack on 15 Feb 2005 and who suffered blisters,
throat, eye and lung irritations and vomiting.
CSW international president Dr Martin Panter told Reuters a Thai
doctor had examined the rebels 5 days after the attack and reported
the men "were extremely sick, they were not able to eat, their skin
had a yellow color to it and severe irritation".
According to a draft CSW report posted on <http://www.csw.org.uk>,
the attack occurred at the Karen border post Nya My, 10 km (6 miles)
west of the Thai hill town of Mae Hong Son, during prolonged heavy
artillery shelling which started on 14 Jan 2005.
On the morning of 15 Feb, a shell exploded near the post, giving off
pungent yellow smoke, unlike the usual black and white smoke from
artillery shells, the report said. [Chlorine gas is usually described
as having a yellowish-green cast. - Mod.TG]
"When the shell exploded immediately a thick yellow vapour, like a
cloud, emanated from it," said Panter, who examined the rebels on 15
Apr 2005.
"They said immediately on inhaling some of this yellow vapour they
felt sick, their eyes burned, their throat burned. They found it very
difficult to breathe, they became very short of breath," said Panter
in Australia on Friday.
A Thai military intelligence officer confirmed shelling had taken
place in the area on 15 Feb 2005, but said he did not know if
chemical weapons had been used.
"We've collected evidence around the area for lab tests, but we
haven't got any results yet," the officer told Reuters.
The Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA), most of whose soldiers are
Christian, has waged a 56-year war -- Asia's longest insurgency --
against the military junta in the former Burma, demanding autonomy
for an ethnic Karen state. They struck a loose deal in January 2004
to end hostilities, but skirmishes continue.
The Myanmar army was accused of using chemical weapons in the 1990s,
but there has never been any proof.
Myanmar Information Minister Brigadier General Kyaw Hsan said
government troops were not even involved in the 15 Feb 2005 fighting,
which he said involved rival militias. "These 2 groups are only
using conventional weapons and Myanmar does not have the technology
to produce chemical weapons," he told reporters in Yangon.
KNLA commander-in-chief Mutu Saepoe told Reuters in an exclusive
interview 2 weeks after the alleged incident that there had been
skirmishes between the army and his men in the area. However, when
asked to describe the nature of the fighting, he made no mention of
chemical weapons.
Panter said the rebels had never witnessed anything like the yellow
vapour before. "These are not rookie soldiers. They are experienced,
hardened soldiers, most of them having fought with the Karenni
resistance for between 15 and 25 years," he said.
2 of the men started vomiting blood within 30 minutes, Panter said,
and within a few hours none of them could stand up.
All were [carried on stretchers] to the Thai hill town of Mae Hong Son, and
then taken to the northern (Thai) city of Chiang Mai for treatment but sent
back to Myanmar sick and barely able to walk, he said.
Panter said when he examined the rebels they were still very weak and
were suffering the affects of what he believes was an attack with a
chemical cocktail.
"Certainly there was very strong evidence of blistering and severe
irritation of the skin. From the conclusion I have made, it was
probably a cocktail of chemicals, containing a blister agent similar
to mustard gas, probably a nerve agent similar to sarin gas and also
a pulmonary agent affecting the lungs."
CSW is a human rights organisation specialising in religious freedom.
It began in 1979 as the British branch of the Swiss-based organisation,
Christian Solidarity International.
Since independence from Britain in 1948, Myanmar has been convulsed by a
series of ethnic guerrilla conflicts with the ruling ethnic Burman majority.
The Karen number around 1.5 million inside Myanmar, according to rebels.

[This report is of the alleged effect of a single shell, after 4 weeks of
heavy shelling. No results of laboratory tests on the alleged victims'
lesions are given. It has been suggested that the shell could have contained
trichothecene mycotoxins (poisons produced by fungal molds on wheat), which
were allegedly used in Vietnam & Laos in the 1981 "yellow rain" attacks --
see <http://cns.miis.edu/pubs/week/020805.htm> -- but on analysis the
substance turned out to be bee feces. CSW has been alleging chemical or
toxin attacks on rebels by the governments of Burma & Sudan since at least
1981, but none of their allegations has ever been conclusively proved. -
