In February 2007, the Pennsylvania Department of Health received
reports, through routine electronic laboratory disease reporting, of
2 persons with recent laboratory-confirmed infections with
_Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhimurium. Both persons had reported
drinking raw (unpasteurized) milk from the same York County,
Pennsylvania, dairy (dairy A). _S._ Typhimurium isolates from these
persons had pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns that
were indistinguishable by use of the XbaI restriction enzyme. The
same month, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture (PDA) received
reports of illness from raw milk customers of dairy A. PDA obtained
milk samples from the raw milk bulk tank at dairy A, which yielded
_S._ Typhimurium with a PFGE pattern that was identical to the
pattern from patient isolates.

On 26 Feb 2007, the Pennsylvania Department of Health and PDA
launched an investigation to determine the source and scope of the
outbreak. This report summarizes the findings of that investigation,
which determined that 29 cases of diarrheal illness caused by _S._
Typhimurium were associated with consumption of raw milk or raw milk
products from dairy A. The findings underscore the need to inform
policy makers and the public of the potential health risks associated
with raw milk consumption.

Epidemiologic and Laboratory Investigation
--------------------------------
In Pennsylvania, raw milk sales are legal at farms that hold a PDA
permit, and vendors must display public notices regarding the
potential hazards of consuming raw milk (1). Dairy A owned 120 cows
and sold raw milk for pasteurization and by PDA permit directly to
consumers. In February 2007, PDA estimated that dairy A was selling
200-300 gallons of raw milk weekly to 275 regular customers.

A case of salmonellosis was defined as a diarrheal illness with onset
since 1 Feb 2007, in a Pennsylvania resident who provided a stool
specimen that tested positive for _S._ Typhimurium with a PFGE
pattern that matched the outbreak pattern by use of the XbaI
restriction enzyme. Nationally notifiable disease reports from
Pennsylvania since January 2005 were reviewed for PFGE-matched _S._
Typhimurium isolates to identify cases and risk factors. To locate
additional cases, ill household contacts of persons with confirmed
cases were asked to provide food histories and submit stool specimens
for testing. Raw milk for testing was obtained from dairy A milk
tanks on 5 dates in 2007 (20 and 28 Feb, 27 Mar, 14 May, and 19 Jul
2007) and from households of 2 ill persons on 2 dates (28 Feb and 20
Jul 2007). In addition, PDA conducted multiple dairy A inspections
during February-July 2007.

Investigative Findings
--------------------
A total of 29 cases were identified, with illness onset occurring in
3 temporal clusters during 3 Feb-14 Jul 2007 (Figure [for figure, see
original URL. - Mod.LL]). The 1st cluster consisted of 15 cases with
onsets of illness from 3 Feb to 5 Mar 2007. Raw milk samples were
collected on 20 Feb 2007 from a dairy A bulk milk tank and 28 Feb
2007 from the home of an ill person. Both sets of samples yielded the
outbreak strain of _S._ Typhimurium. On 2 Mar 2007, PDA ordered dairy
A to stop raw milk sales and advised the public not to consume raw
milk products from dairy A.

On 19 Mar 2007, PDA allowed dairy A to resume sales of raw milk after
PDA conducted inspections and recorded 2 consecutive negative
cultures from milk-tank samples. However, a 2nd cluster of 3 cases
was detected when the outbreak strain of _S._ Typhimurium was
identified in another patient, whose diarrheal illness began on 21
Mar 2007 and who had consumed raw milk from dairy A after sales
resumed. The 2 additional cases were identified in persons with
onsets of illness on 19 and 22 Mar 2007. The 1st of these occurred in
one of 6 ill persons who primarily spoke Spanish and who told
investigators they had not consumed raw milk. However, when
re-interviewed in early April 2007, 3 of these 6 persons reported
consuming queso fresco (a type of soft cheese) they bought at a
grocery store serving the local Hispanic community. PDA learned that
the queso fresco had been made by an unlicensed producer who
purchased approximately 20 gallons of raw milk weekly from dairy A.
Sale of raw milk cheeses aged less than 60 days is illegal in
Pennsylvania. Subsequently, in April 2007, PDA inspectors seized 18
unlabeled retail containers of queso fresco from the grocery store.
The cheese tested positive for alkaline phosphatase, indicating the
cheese was produced from unpasteurized milk (2). Bacterial cultures
were negative for pathogens.

On 27 Mar 2007, PDA again ordered dairy A to halt raw milk sales and
suspended its raw milk permit. No additional cases were noted until
June-July 2007, when a 3rd cluster of 11 PFGE-matched _S._
Typhimurium cases was detected through routine electronic laboratory
reporting. Of these, 10 occurred among residents of 3 counties near
dairy A. On 19 Jul 2007, PDA confirmed that dairy A had been
distributing raw milk to the public despite its suspended permit; the
date when illegal milk distribution began could not be determined.
The outbreak strain of _S._ Typhimurium was isolated from dairy A raw
milk collected from a bulk milk tank on 19 Jul 2007 and from the home
of an ill person on 20 Jul 2007. PDA ordered dairy A to halt
distribution of raw milk on 20 Jul 2007 and subsequently revoked the
raw milk permit for this dairy.

Among the 29 persons identified with diarrheal illness and
PFGE-matched _S._ Typhimurim, 17 (59 percent) were male, and the
median age was 6 years (range 5 months-76 years). 14 (48 percent)
patients reported drinking raw milk from dairy A, 4 (14 percent)
consumed unregulated queso fresco (3 linked to dairy A raw milk and
one from an unknown source), and 2 (7 percent) consumed raw milk but
did not identify the source. Two (7 percent) other patients were
unrelated infants aged 5 months and 7 months. The parents of these
infants acknowledged that raw milk from dairy A was present in their
households but told investigators the milk was not consumed by the
infants. For 7 (24 percent) patients who did not reside with any of
the other patients, no source of exposure to _S._ Typhimurium could
be determined. Two of the 29 patients were hospitalized; no deaths
were reported.

Environmental Inspections
----------------------
Eight PDA inspections of dairy A conducted during January-April 2007
revealed improper cleaning of milking equipment, insufficient
supervision of workers, unspecified illness among lactating cows, and
bird and rodent infestation. On at least 2 inspections, the required
public notice regarding the potential hazards of drinking raw milk
was not visible at the dairy A retail store.

_S._ Typhimurium matched by PFGE to the outbreak pattern was isolated
from dairy A raw milk tank samples collected on 3 different dates in
2007 (20 Feb, 14 May, and 19 Jul 2007); an _S._ Typhimurium isolate
collected from a milk tank 28 Feb 2007 was unavailable for PFGE
typing. In addition to salmonellae, dairy A raw milk tank samples
also yielded _Listeria monocytogenes_ (28 Feb, 14 May, and 19 Jul
2007) and _Campylobacter jejuni_ (28 Feb and 14 May 2007). Although a
stool specimen from one patient with a 28 Feb 2007 illness onset
yielded both _S._ Typhimurium and _C. jejuni_, the _Campylobacter_
isolate was unavailable for subtyping. No _Listeria_ infections were
associated with dairy A.

Editorial Note
--------------
Raw milk is a well-documented source of infections from _Salmonella_,
_E. coli_ O157:H7, _Campylobacter_, _Listeria_, _Mycobacterium
bovis_, and other pathogens (2-6). In 1938, before widespread
adoption of milk pasteurization in the USA, an estimated 25 percent
of all foodborne and waterborne outbreaks of disease were associated
with milk (7). By 2001, the percentage of such outbreaks associated
with milk was estimated at less than one percent (7). During
1998-2005, a total of 45 outbreaks of foodborne illness were reported
to CDC in which unpasteurized milk (or cheese suspected to have been
made from unpasteurized milk) was implicated. These outbreaks
accounted for 1007 illnesses, 104 hospitalizations, and 2 deaths
(CDC, unpublished data, 2007). Because not all cases of foodborne
illness are recognized and reported, the actual number of illnesses
associated with unpasteurized milk likely is greater.

In the investigations described in this report, the evidence
indicating raw milk from dairy A as the source of this outbreak
included the 1) high percentage of ill persons who reported consuming
either raw milk (48 percent) or queso fresco traced to raw milk (10
percent) from dairy A; 2) temporal associations between clusters of
illnesses and starts and stops of distribution of raw milk by dairy
A; and 3) repeated isolation of the outbreak strain of _S._
Typhimurium from dairy A raw milk tanks. The PFGE pattern of the
outbreak strain (XbaI JPXX01.0022) is rare, previously identified
only 24 times in isolates from 11 states in 3 years, in a national
PulseNet database of approximately 43 000 _S._ Typhimurium isolates.

Consumers have reported consuming raw milk for convenience, taste
preference, or perceived health benefits. Although some advocates
claim health benefits from raw milk compared with pasteurized milk,
including decreased risks for atherosclerosis, arthritis, and lactose
intolerance, such claims are not supported by scientific evidence
(8). Unsubstantiated claims of health benefits of raw milk for
infants and children are particularly concerning for care givers,
because infants and children are dependent on their care givers to
make safe dietary decisions for them. 16 of the 29 ill persons in
this outbreak were aged less than 7 years.

Pathogens that infect humans are shed in the feces of cows, can be
present in or on the udders of cows, and can contaminate their milk.
Standard hygiene practices during milking can reduce but not
eliminate the risk for milk contamination. In a 2001-2002 survey of
Pennsylvania dairy farms, pathogenic bacteria, including
_Salmonella_, were isolated from 13 percent of samples from raw milk
bulk tanks (9). Pasteurization decreases the number of pathogenic
organisms, prevents transmission of pathogens, and has been
determined to improve the safety of milk more than other measures,
including certification of raw milk (4,5).

Farms in Pennsylvania that hold PDA raw milk permits undergo
twice-monthly milk testing for coliforms and standard plate counts
and monthly testing for growth inhibitors and somatic cell counts;
annual PDA inspection and culture of raw milk for _Salmonella_,
_Campylobacter_, _E. coli_ O157, and _L. monocytogenes_; and annual
herd skin testing for _Mycobacterium bovis_ and _Brucella_ (1).
Despite these measures, consumers cannot be assured that certified
raw milk is free of pathogens.

As of 2004, at least 27 states permitted some form of raw milk sales
to the public, including sales at dairies, farmers' markets, or
through purchase of "cow shares." Certain states also allow public
sales of raw milk but for pet food only (10). In Pennsylvania, the
number of dairies with raw milk permits increased from 42 in 2005 to
75 in 2007. During 2006-2007, 3 clusters of illness from
_Campylobacter_ were associated with consumption of raw milk from 3
different Pennsylvania dairies (Pennsylvania Department of Health,
unpublished data, 2007). During the same period, PDA announced raw
milk recalls from 3 other dairies after finding _L. monocytogenes_ in
milk samples; no human illness was associated with these findings.

Given the continued interest in raw milk production, policy makers,
parents, and the public need to be informed regarding the potential
health risks posed by raw-milk consumption. The only sure way for
consumers to prevent raw milk-associated infection from _Salmonella_
or other pathogens is to refrain from consuming raw milk.
