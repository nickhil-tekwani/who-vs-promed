Omicron is now the dominant strain of Covid-19 in the Republic of Ireland, according to authorities, who said that recent measures had slowed down the spread somewhat.

As Ireland's Department of Health confirmed that there had been 5124 new cases of COVID-19, it said that it estimated that 52% of reported cases are as a result of the omicron variant.

Chief Medical Officer Dr. Tony Holohan told RTE News: "It has taken less than 2 weeks for omicron to become the dominant strain of COVID-19 in Ireland, revealing just how transmissible this variant is.

The deputy first minister of Northern Ireland's power sharing executive, Michelle O'Neill, has warned that omicron will hit the community there "like a ton of bricks".

She said that modelling presented to her and other officials suggested that, in a worst-case scenario, it could be facing 30 000 omicron cases a day.

[2] Mandatory certificates
Date: Mon 13 Dec 2021
From: Jessamy Bagenal [edited]


Earlier this week the UK introduced a raft of Plan B measures in response to rapid increases in COVID-19 cases. One of these measures was the introduction of mandatory certificates for double vaccination or a negative test result to enter nightclubs and crowded venues. Some critics of the restrictions questioned whether there was evidence that mandatory certificates made an impact in either encouraging the unvaccinated to get vaccinated or in reducing COVID-19 infection rates. As has been the case often during the pandemic, public health measures have been pitted against individual liberties, which is a false dichotomy, public health measures are designed to protect individuals. There are important ethical considerations when it comes to introducing COVID-19 certificates, particularly in terms of exacerbating existing inequalities and structural biases.

A study published in The Lancet Public Health designed a synthetic control model looking at 6 countries - Denmark, Israel, Italy, France, Germany, and Switzerland - who had introduced certificates during 2021, with 19 countries that did not have certificates as a control. Using a variety of data like vaccinations and deaths they produced a counterfactual trend assessing what might have happened if certificates were not in place. They showed that COVID-19 certification might lead to increased uptake of vaccinations up to 20 days before to 40 days after the implementation of certificates. The increase in uptake of vaccination appeared to be greatest in people younger than 30 years of age. There are many limitations to the study and it may be difficult to generalise these findings given certificates were introduced in many different contexts at different times with different overall vaccination coverage. Much more research is needed to explore the impact of mandatory vaccine certificates on uptake of vaccinations, COVID-19 infection rates and how they might create new or effect old entrenched inequalities.

Summary
Background
Mandatory COVID-19 certification (showing vaccination, recent negative test, or proof of recovery) has been introduced in some countries. We aimed to investigate the effect of certification on vaccine uptake.

Methods
We designed a synthetic control model comparing 6 countries (Denmark, Israel, Italy, France, Germany, and Switzerland) that introduced certification (April-August, 2021), with 19 control countries. Using daily data on cases, deaths, vaccinations, and country-specific information, we produced a counterfactual trend estimating what might have happened in similar circumstances if certificates were not introduced. The main outcome was daily COVID-19 vaccine doses.

Findings
COVID-19 certification led to increased vaccinations 20 days before implementation in anticipation, with a lasting effect up to 40 days after. Countries with pre-intervention uptake that was below average had a more pronounced increase in daily vaccinations compared with those where uptake was already average or higher. In France, doses exceeded 55 672 (95% CI 49 668-73 707) vaccines per million population or, in absolute terms, 3 761 440 (3 355 761 -4 979 952) doses before mandatory certification and 72 151 (37 940 - 114 140) per million population after certification (4 874 857 [2 563 396 - 7 711 769] doses). We found no effect in countries that already had average uptake (Germany), or an unclear effect when certificates were introduced during a period of limited vaccine supply (Denmark). Increase in uptake was highest for people younger than 30 years after the introduction of certification. Access restrictions linked to certain settings (nightclubs and events with [greater than] 1000 people) were associated with increased uptake in those younger than 20 years. When certification was extended to broader settings, uptake remained high in the youngest group, but increases were also observed in those aged 30-49 years.

Interpretation
Mandatory COVID-19 certification could increase vaccine uptake, but interpretation and transferability of findings need to be considered in the context of pre-existing levels of vaccine uptake and hesitancy, eligibility changes, and the pandemic trajectory.

Discussion
The introduction of mandatory certificates raises multiple ethical issues such as a risk of exacerbating inequalities among certain ethnic or socioeconomic groups that have lower uptake and trust in authorities. Certificates might also generate inequalities in contexts where differential age-specific roll-outs exist for vaccines or boosters. Certificates also have the potential to create a digital divide if passes are largely electronic or cannot be used across devices or national borders, and might raise data privacy and linkage concerns. Although we found that certification increased vaccine uptake in certain settings and groups, COVID-19 certification alone will not increase vaccine uptake among all groups. Other measures such as geographically targeted vaccine drives or peer-to-peer and community dialogue within low-trust groups to generate understanding might be more effective for certain groups. COVID-19 certification is only part of a constellation of multiple policy levers that could be used to counter vaccine complacency and hesitancy and increase uptake. Younger people and certain groups such as men and those from low socioeconomic backgrounds have shown increased levels of vaccine complacency because of a lower perception of the risk of COVID-19, suggesting that mandatory certification could be one mechanism to increase uptake among those groups to reach population-level immunity and protect the broader population.

https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kremlin-convinced-who-will-approve-sputnik-v-vaccine-within-months-ifax-2021-12-19/

The Kremlin is convinced that the World Health Organization (WHO) will recognise Russia's flagship Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine within a few months, the Interfax news agency cited Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov as saying.

The Kremlin on [Tue 14 Dec 2021] said Russia had still not handed over all the information needed for the vaccine to be approved by the WHO because of differences in regulatory standards.

- France not planning to extend (Childrens') Christmas holidays due to COVID: minister
https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2021-12-19/france-not-planning-to-extend-christmas-holidays-due-to-covid-minister

French Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer said on BFM television that the government has no plans to extend the Christmas school holidays because of the rapid spread of the omicron variant.

Some European countries have brought Christmas holidays forward, and French conservative presidential candidate Valerie Pecresse has called for an extension of them in order to help ensure any infections caught over year-end holidays are discovered before children return to school.

- Italy eyes new COVID-19 measures amid omicron worries: reports
https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/italy-eyes-new-covid-19-measures-amid-omicron-worries-newspapers-2021-12-19/

Italy's government is considering new measures to avoid a surge in COVID infections during the holiday period, local newspapers reported, amid worries over the spread of the omicron variant.

After holding a meeting with ministers on [Thu 23 Dec 2021], Prime Minister Mario Draghi could impose an obligation on the vaccinated to show a negative test to access crowded places, including discos and stadiums, daily Corriere della Sera reported.

Under current rules, people who have been vaccinated or have recently recovered from the disease have free access to indoor seating at bars and restaurants, museums, cinemas, clubs and sporting events.

"Some measures, such as making masks compulsory even outdoors ... could be taken soon," Franco Locatelli, one of the government's main scientific advisors, told the newspaper.

- Netherlands starts 'painful' Christmas coronavirus lockdown https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/12/19/omicron-latest-updates-live-news

Shopping streets in the Netherlands were closed and people's Christmas plans were in disarray as the country began a lockdown aimed at limiting an expected COVID-19 surge.

Prime Minister Mark Rutte announced the sudden shut-down on [Sat 18 Dec 2021] evening, ordering the closure of all but the most essential stores, as well as restaurants, hairdressers, gyms, museums and other public places from [Sun 19 Dec 2021] until at least [Fri 14 Jan 2022].

Hospitality workers demanded compensation for lost income in the holiday season, while gym owners stressed the importance of exercise during a health crisis.

"Closing all bars and restaurants in such an important month is incredibly painful and dramatic. We need compensation and an exit strategy", the Dutch association for hospitality services said.

- Iran announces first case of omicron variant
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/12/19/iran-announces-first-case-of-omicron-variant

Iran has detected its first case of infection by the omicron variant of the coronavirus, state TV reported.

Deputy Health Minister Kamal Heidari told state TV that the infected person was a middle-age Iranian man who recently returned to Iran from the United Arab Emirates.

"The necessary measures were taken to quarantine this person who lives in Tehran and those who were in contact with him," Heidari said. "This is the first case of omicron [coronavirus] variant that has been identified in Iran."

Iran has vaccinated some 60% of its population of roughly 85 million people with 2 doses of coronavirus vaccines.

Officials urged people who got two doses of vaccine to get their 3rd dose as soon as possible.

- London Mayor: Inevitable we will have more COVID restrictions
https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/london-mayor-inevitable-we-will-have-more-covid-restrictions-2021-12-19/]

New COVID-19 restrictions are inevitable as without them Britain will see public services such as the National Health Service (NHS) on the verge of collapse, London Mayor Sadiq Khan told BBC Television.

Khan declared a "major incident" on [Sat 18 Dec 2021] to help the capital's hospitals cope with a surge in COVID-19 cases caused by the fast-spreading omicron coronavirus variant.

"I think it's inevitable," Khan told the BBC when asked about the likelihood of further restrictions. "If we don't bring in new restrictions sooner rather than later you're going to see even more positive cases and potentially public services like the NHS on the verge of collapse, if not collapsing."

- UK is monitoring COVID data closely, to act if necessary: health minister
https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2021-12-19/uk-is-monitoring-covid-19-data-closely-to-act-if-necessary-health-minister

The British government is monitoring the latest COVID-19 data on an almost hourly basis and will do whatever is necessary to tackle the spread, health minister Sajid Javid told Sky News.

Javid said analysis of the data suggested around 60% of all new COVID-19 cases in England are the fast-spreading omicron variant, but the country was in a better position than last Christmas thanks to things such as vaccinations and testing.

Asked about reports of possible further measures, Javid said: "We will do what is necessary but it has got to be backed up by the data ... we are watching the data, discussing it with our scientists and our best advisers almost on an hourly basis and we will monitor that very carefully we will keep the situation under review."

- China administered total of 2.67bn doses of COVID-19 vaccines
https://www.statista.com/statistics/1196142/china-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccination-doses/

As of [Sun 12 Dec 2021], China had administered about 2.61 billion doses of coronavirus COVID-19 vaccine, whereas about 8.47 billion doses of the vaccine had been applied worldwide. Vaccines developed by the Chinese pharmaceutical companies Sinovac and Sinopharm have received approvals and advance purchase agreements in countries like Brazil, Turkey, and Indonesia.

- Omicron less effective at attacking lungs than other variants: Study
https://7news.com.au/lifestyle/health-wellbeing/omicron-less-effective-attacking-lungs-c-5011619

British research has found omicron might be less efficient at attacking the lungs than earlier COVID-19 variants.

The Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology and Infectious Disease study concluded mutations on the virus's spike protein, which makes it able to avoid antibodies, may also reduce how it replicates in the lungs and causes severe disease.

"These observations highlight that omicron has gained immune evasion properties whilst compromising on properties associated with replication and pathogenicity," the study's abstract stated.

Study leader Ravi Gupta, a professor of clinical microbiology at Cambridge, said there are still challenges ahead despite the seemingly positive findings.

He tweeted: "What does this all mean? Efficient infection of lung cells could correlate with severity of lung disease. Syncitia or fused cells are often seen in respiratory tissues taken following severe disease. Delta was very good at both, in contrast to omicron. Further work is needed."

- Australia says it is well prepared for mounting COVID-19 cases
https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-says-it-is-well-prepared-mounting-covid-19-cases-2021-12-19/

Australian officials on [Sun 19 Dec 2021] said there was no need to clamp down on Christmas festivities even as new COVID-19 infections climbed in Sydney, with the country's high vaccination rate helping keep people out of hospital.

Health Minister Greg Hunt said he was confident Australia would not need to follow the Netherlands, which has reimposed a strict lockdown over the Christmas and New Year period to curb the spread of the highly contagious omicron variant.

"We're going into summer; we have one of the highest vaccination rates in the world and a very different set of circumstances. So, we don't see that's a likely situation in Australia," Hunt told reporters in a televised media conference.

"We're well prepared and people are overwhelmingly ... continuing to do an amazing job," Hunt said, referring to the more than 90% of Australians over 16 who have been fully vaccinated.
