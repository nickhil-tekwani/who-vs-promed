Abstract
--------
_Aedes vittatus_ Bigot is distributed throughout Africa, tropical Asia, and southern Europe and occurs in sylvatic as well as peridomestic environments where it readily feeds on humans. Although the vectorial capacity of _Ae. vittatus_ is not well understood, this species is known to play a role in the maintenance and transmission of yellow fever, Zika, chikungunya, and dengue viruses within its native range. In October 2019, after a routine inspection of mosquito-breeding containers in Jarabacoa, Dominican Republic, 2 _Ae. vittatus_ females were captured via human landing catch method. After this finding, a CDC miniature light trap was deployed at the point of initial detection from 18:00 to 08:00 h, 2 d/wk from 3 to 31 Oct 2019. Potential larval habitats were also sampled via the traditional dip method once per week spanning a 150 m radius from point of initial detection. In addition to the 2 adult females, 10 female and 2 male _Ae. vittatus_ were captured. One _Ae. vittatus_ larva also was found in a small puddle formed by an animal hoof print. Conventional PCR and Sanger sequencing were used to confirm morphological identification of collected specimens. This is the 1st detection of _Ae. vittatus_ in the Dominican Republic as well as the Americas. Therefore, enhanced surveillance is needed to better understand the range and public health risks this potential invasive mosquito species may pose in the Dominican Republic, other Caribbean Islands, and/or the Americas.

[It appears that _Ae. vittatus_ may become established in the Dominican Republic. If it does, there are no barriers to prevent it from becoming further established in Haiti as well, with which it shares the Island of Hispaniola. Subsequently, it may reach other Caribbean Islands and Central American countries, Mexico, and Florida. One hopes that this mosquito will be eliminated in the Dominican Republic so that establishment does not occur. - Mod.TY
