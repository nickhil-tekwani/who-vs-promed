A cat living near North Foothills Highway and Plateau Road in Boulder County was examined by a veterinarian on [Wed 2 Jun 2021], tested positive for plague. The cat's owner was concerned when the cat became ill 2-3 weeks after being found with a baby rabbit.

This is the 1st time plague activity has been confirmed in Boulder County this season and public health officials want to remind residents of how to protect themselves against plague. Boulder County Parks and Open Space was notified of the positive plague in the area, and warning signs will be posted in this neighborhood with precautionary measures to avoid the plague.

"Because plague is most commonly transmitted by fleas, taking steps to avoid flea exposures will help prevent spread of the disease," said Carol McInnes, Boulder County Public Health Environmental Health Specialist.

Public health officials recommend the following precautions to reduce the likelihood of being exposed to plague:
- Avoid fleas. Protect pets with flea treatment recommended by your veterinarian and keep pets on a leash and out of wildlife habitats.
- Stay out of areas inhabited by wild rodents and rabbits. If you enter areas with rodents or rabbits, wear insect repellent containing DEET and tuck pants cuffs into socks to prevent flea bites.
- Avoid all contact with wildlife, including rabbits and squirrels; do not feed or handle them.
- Do not touch sick or dead animals.
- Prevent rodent infestations around your house: clear plants and materials away from outside walls, reduce access to food items, and set traps.
- Treat burrows on your property if you find dead rabbits or rodents with an insecticide approved by the EPA for use on fleas and follow the manufacturer's instructions on the label.

Household pets, such as dogs and especially cats, can either get plague or carry infected fleas home to their owners. In rare instances, plague can be transmitted to people from cats sick with plague.

"Keeping cats indoors is the best way to protect them from getting plague," said McInnes. "Pet owners should also discuss with their veterinarians the best way to protect pets from fleas."

Plague occurs naturally in Colorado, and is an infectious disease spread by fleas to wild rodents and other small mammals such as prairie dogs and rabbits. Bubonic plague is the most common form of plague and occurs after a bite from an infected flea. Plague can spread to humans when infected fleas from rabbits, prairie dogs, and other wild rodents bite a human.

Symptoms of plague in human beings include high fever, extreme fatigue, and painful swollen lymph nodes. If you observe these symptoms in a person or pet, it is important to contact your healthcare provider or veterinarian immediately. Plague can be treated with antibiotics, but this treatment is most successful when the disease can be diagnosed quickly.

[Plague, caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, is an infectious disease found in small mammals, such as squirrels, small rodents, sometimes our domestic animals, and because it is a zoonotic disease, it may also affect people. It is usually transmitted in a cycle between fleas and the host. A host may be a dog, cat, squirrel or other rodents, or other animal or human beings. The flea transmits the disease between the various mammalian hosts

"- People infected with _Y. pestis_ often develop symptoms after an incubation period of 1 to 7 days.
- There are 2 main clinical forms of plague infection [Actually there are 3 forms - Mod.TG]: bubonic and pneumonic [and septicemic - Mod.TG] Bubonic plague is the most common form and is characterized by painful swollen lymph nodes or 'buboes'.
- Plague is transmitted between animals and humans by the bite of infected fleas, direct contact with infected tissues, and inhalation of infected respiratory droplets.
- Plague can be a very severe disease in people, with a case-fatality ratio of 30% to 60% for the bubonic type, and is always fatal for the pneumonic kind when left untreated.
- Antibiotic treatment is effective against plague bacteria, so early diagnosis and early treatment can save lives."

"Septicemic plague results when the plague spreads through the blood and affects multiple internal organs (such as the spleen, liver, heart, and lungs).

"Dogs are inherently resistant to the plague-causing bacteria. Dogs becoming infected with plague are less likely to show signs of illness than infected cats. Signs may include fever, lethargy, inflammation of the lymph nodes below the lower jaw, a pus-like lesion along the jaw, lesions in the mouth, and cough.

"Due to the rapid progression of this disease, treatment for suspected plague (and infection control practices) should be started before a definitive diagnosis is obtained with bacterial cultures. Your veterinarian will recommend an antibiotic as standard treatment.

"Along with treatment and diagnostic considerations, protection of people and other animals and initiation of public health interventions are critical when an animal is suspected to have plague. Even before a diagnosis is complete, animals with signs suggestive of plague should be placed in isolation and infection control measures implemented to protect you and your family, other household pets, and any other animals or individuals that have had contact with the infected pet.

"To decrease the risk of pets and humans being exposed to plague, pet owners in areas where the disease may be found should keep their pets from roaming and hunting, limit their contact with rodent or rabbit carcasses, and use appropriate flea control. Your veterinarian can suggest the most appropriate flea control product for your pet."

Protecting your pets from fleas is critical for their well-being, and for yours. Fleas carry plague and potentially other diseases. But what do you use to treat your pet? There are a number of products on the market. However, some over-the-counter medications can be toxic to your pets, especially cats. A brand name does not mean safety and effectiveness. As a plea for your pet's health and safety is paramount; please consult your veterinarian about safe and effective flea prevention. In some areas the fleas are resistant to some preventions. The veterinarian is most familiar with what products are safe and effective in your area. - Mod.TG
