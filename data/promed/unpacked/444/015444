[The reports about botulism are frequent in different regions of
Russia. During April 2008, there were reports about a group of cases
in Moscow, Rostov oblast, Buryatia. Possibly, not all the information
about the cases is available over the Internet. The cold season had
passed, and, possibly, the people started to use up the food reserves
of the previous year. Despite the fact that more reports about
botulism are coming from Russia, the highest incidence of this
disease according to WHO occurs in Georgia. There were 40 cases of
botulism in Georgia during 2006. - Mod.NP]
