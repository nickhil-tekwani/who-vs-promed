Characterisation of the Virus Causing the Current HPAI Outbreak in the
Netherlands
----------------------------------------------------------------------
On Sat 1 Mar 2003 five 70-week old layer chickens at a farm in Scherpenzeel
that were suffering from respiratory problems, diarrhoea, yawning and
swollen heads and combs were culled and sent to us by the national
inspection service for livestock and meat (RVV) for investigation. Upon
autopsy, gross lesions of the animals included marked subcutaneous oedema of
head, comb and wattles, diffuse pulmonary oedema, and multifocal haemorrhage
in various tissues, consistent with highly pathogenic avian influenza
(HPAI). Cloacal swabs and tracheal swabs were collected for influenza virus
antigen detection as well as RNA isolation for molecular diagnostics. Swabs
obtained from 4 out of 5 animals showed a weak positive reaction for
influenza A virus in the Directigen A/B test (Becton Dickinson), a viral
antigen detection system. All cloacal and tracheal swabs were negative upon
RT-PCR testing for Newcastle disease virus and other avian paramyxoviruses.
RT-PCR specific for the matrix gene of influenza A virus showed that all
five animals were positive, confirming the Directigen antigen detection
results.
Parts of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes were amplified
by RT-PCR and sequenced providing clear evidence for the viral subtype:
H7N7. The HA gene displayed high homology to the HA of
A/Mallard/Netherlands/12/00 (H7N3) and the NA gene displayed high homology
to the NA gene of A/Shoveler/Netherlands/18/99 (H11N7), two viruses isolated
within our ongoing avian influenza virus surveillance studies. Since no
viruses in the public sequence databases displayed higher homology to the
H7N7 virus than the viruses isolated from Dutch wild ducks (_Anas
platyrhynchos_ and _Anas clypeata_) and because the virus subtype is
distinct from those involved in recent HPAI outbreaks elsewhere in the
world, we suspect that this H7N7 virus was introduced from a wild bird
reservoir (ducks, geese).
The HA protein of the H7N7 virus contains a protease cleavage site
consisting of multiple basic amino acids, PEIPKRRRR*GLF in agreement with
this virus being classified as an HPAI. This cleavage site is distinct from
those seen in other recent H7 HPAI outbreaks. Since the cleavage site of HA
of A/Mallard/Netherlands/12/00 (PEIPKGR*GLF) does not contain multiple basic
amino acid residues, it is possible that a low pathogenic duck virus was
transmitted to poultry, in which it has mutated to an HPAI, as was the case
with HPAI (H7N1) in Italy in 1999-2000.
Further characterisation of the virus genome and histology and
immunohistochemistry of the organs of affected animals is currently in
progress.

[The authors or this report are to be congratulated in respect of the
remarkable speed with which this critical analysis has been carried out. The
haemagglutinin (HA) protein of influenza virus is a trimer of
disulphide-linked HA1 and HA2 molecules that mediates the attachment and
entry of the virus into a host cell. The haemagglutinin protein is
synthesized as an HA0 precursor molecule which is cleaved to HA1 and HA2.
Virions with uncleaved haemagglutinin are non-infectious. Haemagglutinin
cleavability is dependent on both the primary structure at the cleavage site
and the presence of appropriate proteases in the cell membrane. Consequently
the properties of the haemagglutinin protein play a major role in
determining the relative virulence of influenza viruses. In the case of
avian influenza viruses, epithelial cells of the respiratory and intestinal
tracts can mediate cleavage of the viral haemagglutinin protein and support
viral multiplication. On the other hand, only the haemagglutinin protein of
virulent viruses is susceptible to cleavage in more vulnerable tissues
leading to systemic disease and death. This phenomenon accounts for both
the difference in virulence of virus strains and the inherent differences in
susceptibility of different avian species. In general, wild ducks appear to
be resistant to strains of avian influenza viruses which are highly virulent
in domestic fowl. The data presented above by Drs. Fouchier, Kuiken,
Pluimers and Osterhaus establish with reasonable certainty that the H7N7
avian influenza virus responsible for the current outbreak in the
Netherlands arose by mutation of a wild duck virus subsequent to
transmission to domestic poultry. - Mod.CP]
