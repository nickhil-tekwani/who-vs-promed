Just a quick note to correct an error. This organism has been reclassified
and renamed (a year ago?) to _Chlamydophilia psittaci_ along with many of
the strains affecting other species such as _Chlamydophilia felis_, etc.

Changes in the taxonomy of bacteria previously known as _Chlamydia_ in the
family Chlamydiaceae have resulted from genetic and DNA-based testing and
assesment of biological information.
Reference:
Everett, K.D.E., Bush, R.M. & Andersen, A.A. (1999) Emended description of
the order Chlamydiales, proposal of Parachlamydiaceae fam. nov. and
Simkaniaceae fam. nov., each containing one monotypic genus, revised
taxonomy of the family Chlamydiaceae including a new genus and five new
species, and standards for the identification of organisms. Int J Syst
Bacteriol 49, 415-440.
In summary:
The previous taxonomy, _Chlamydia psittaci_, currently includes
_Chlamydophila psittaci_ (typical host -- bird), _Chlamydophila abortus_
(typical hosts -- sheep, mammals), _Chlamydophila felis_ (typical
host--domestic cat), and Chlamydophila caviae (typical host--guinea pig).
The previous taxonomy, Chlamydia pecorum, currently includes Chlamydophila
_pecorum_ (typical hosts -- cattle, sheep, goat, pig). The previous
taxonomy, _Chlamydia pneumoniae_, is now _Chlamydophila pneumoniae_
(typical hosts -- human, horse). _Chlamydia trachomatis_ and the strains
_C. suis_ and _C. muridarum_ retain the genus nomenclature "_Chlamydia_".

[Although Dr. Everett's work is based upon good sequencing data, it has not
been universally accepted by the _Chlamydia_ research community. There was
a letter to the editor in response to the article cited by Dr. Robertson
that was signed by, if memory serves me, approximately 20 of the world's
top _Chlamydia_ researchers in which they strongly opposed Dr. Everett's
taxonomic revisions. I have spoken with Dr. Everett, and find that her
assessment is based on high quality science. However, there is significant
disagreement in the field and the genus _Chlamydophila_ has not been
totally accepted. Clearly, those who signed this letter are not necessarily
researchers of zoonotic species of this genus (or, more likely, these
genera). The term _Chlamydophila_ is being used increasingly among those
researchers who work with these organisms. Sadly, little research funding
is given for work on these zoonotic species.
I thank Dr. Marx and Dr. Robertson for keeping us honest here with respect
to the taxonomic status of this organism. - Man. Ed. DS
