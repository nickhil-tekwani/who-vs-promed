6 Jan 2010 Ministries update
-----------------------------
Ministers Verburg (LNV/Agriculture) and Klink (VWS/Public Health)
have sent a letter to Parliament today [6 Jan 2010] about the
activities regarding Q-fever control. This press release covers the
main points included in that letter, as well as information on
modifications for bulk milk monitoring and other current issues
presented hereunder.

1. Update on the cullings
-------------------------
At the moment, 61 farms have been declared contaminated, based on
bulk milk testing results. We expect to have the results of the
current [biweekly] bulk milk tests next week. At 24 contaminated
farms, animals have been examined for pregnancy to distinguish the
pregnant and not-pregnant. Subsequently, all pregnant animals on
these farms have been valued. So far, a total of 8724 animals on 21
farms have been culled.

2. Small-scale farms and children's/petting farms
-----------------------------------------
Minister Klink has asked the experts' group [see comment] to advise
him about the health risks of Q-fever at children's farms, farms with
less than 50 animals and farms with a public function [e.g. nursing
homes etc.]. According to the experts, no extra measures need to be
taken regarding this cluster of farms.

The experts believe that direct contact with sheep and goats is not a
risk factor. Recent research data also show that Q-fever bacteria are
hardly ever found at children's farms. There are no indications that
children's farms and other small-scale farms have a higher health
risk to the public.

The experts advised, however, to pay special attention to hygiene
measures. Therefore, a hygiene protocol will be made for the
small-scale sheep and goat farms. As soon as this protocol is
available, it will be published on the website page "Hobbydierhouders
en dierhouders met een publieke functie" (Hobby animal holders and
animal keepers with a public function).

Notification to the VWA (Food Safety Authority) in case of an
abnormal number of abortions, has long been obligatory for hobby
animal holders and animal keepers with a public function (like
children's farms). After notification, the VWA used to investigate
the farm as a standard procedure; until recently, such holdings were
tested for _Brucella melitensis_ bacteria (causing Brucellosis).
Currently, such notifications will be followed also by testing for
the Q-fever bacteria (_Coxiella burnetii_).

3. Mutton sheep farms
---------------------
The experts' group led by the RIVM (National Institute for Public
Health and Environment) has already advised on 24 Jul 2009 that
mutton-type sheep farms pose no risk within the Q-fever epidemic.
However, large numbers of ewes are soon to start lambing in the huge
straw-bedding stables at the large-scale mutton-type sheep farms.
Therefore, it has been decided that for these large-scale farms, the
same precautionary policy will be applied as for small-scale farms
with less than 50 ruminants. Hence, the advice addressing the hygiene
protocol for small-scale farms and children's farms will be also
applied in the mutton producing farms.

4. Judicial verdict
-------------------
On 4 Jan 2010, the judge of the Board of Appeal for Commerce and
Industry has issued a sentence on account of the request from a goat
keeper to spare from culling the animals which were kept in a
different location than the holding found infected, although both
groups of animals were registered under the same company number as
the infected farm. The request from this goat keeper has been denied.
According to the judge, both locations are connected units of one
company, as goats have been taken from one location to the other. At
the location which, according to the goat keeper, was Q-fever free,
offspring of goats from the infected holding are kept. The latter was
found infected by means of the bulk milk tests. Besides, the goats on
the Q-fever "free" location have not all been vaccinated on time. The
full text of the judge's sentence (verdict No BK8183 is available at

Zentis for their share in obtaining the above information.

The letter VDC 09.2949/CPM of the Agriculture Minister to the Dutch
Parliament, dated 6 Jan 2010, is accompanied by 2 letters (23 Dec
2009, 5 Jan 2010), addressed to both ministries by Prof Roel
Coutinho, Director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Control of
the RIVM [National Dutch Institute for Public Health and the
Environment]. The 2 letters include the detailed replies to new
queries from the 2 Ministries requesting scientific advice concerning
issues raised during the epidemic. The RIVM response is based upon
consultations of experts, principally veterinarians, physicians and
microbiologists. The consultations are chaired by Prof Coutinho, and
the secretary of the body is Dr Jim van Steenbergen, RIVM. The lists
of the experts involved are attached to each advisory response.
Earlier meetings of the experts group were conducted on 11 and 30 Nov
2009, similarly chaired by Prof Coutinho. Several written advices,
agreed to by the experts, have already been attached to Ministers'
letters to the Parliament (e.g. 16 Dec 2009). All interested in the
various aspects (e.g. scientific-professional, political, social,
economic etc.) of coordinated control of emerging or re-emerging
zoonotic diseases are certainly following with great interest the
evolvement and management of the Dutch Q fever epidemic. - Mod.AS]

_Coxiella burnetii_ Shedding Routes and Antibody Response after
Outbreaks of Q Fever-Induced Abortion in Dairy Goat Herds
---------------------------------
Abstract
Q fever is a zoonosis caused by _Coxiella burnetii_, a bacterium
largely carried by ruminants and shed into milk, vaginal mucus, and
feces. The main potential hazard to humans and animals is due to
shedding of bacteria that can then persist in the environment and be
aerosolized. The purpose of this study was to evaluate shedding after
an outbreak of Q fever abortion in goat herds and to assess the
relationship with the occurrence of abortions and antibody responses.
Aborting and nonaborting goats were monitored by PCR for _C.
burnetii_ shedding 15 and 30 days after the abortion episodes. PCR
analysis of all samples showed that 70 percent (n 50) of the aborting
and 53 percent (n 70) of the non-aborting goats were positive. _C.
burnetii_ was shed into vaginal mucus, feces, and milk of 44, 21, and
38 percent, respectively, of goats that aborted and 27, 20, and 31
percent, respectively, of goats that delivered normally. Statistical
comparison of these shedding results did not reveal any difference
between these 2 groups. PCR results obtained for the vaginal and
fecal routes were concordant in 81 percent of cases, whereas those
for milk correlated with only 49 percent of cases with either vaginal
or fecal shedding status. Serological analysis, using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA),
and complement fixation tests showed that at least 24 percent of the
seronegative goats shed bacteria. Positive vaginal and fecal
shedding, unlike positive milk shedding, was observed more often in
animals that were weakly positive or negative by ELISA or IFA. Two
opposite shedding trends were thus apparent for the milk and
vaginal-fecal routes. Moreover, this study showed that a
non-negligible proportion of seronegative animals that delivered
normally could excrete _C. burnetii_.
