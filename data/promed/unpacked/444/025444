[ProMED post 20060208.0418, published on 8 Feb 2006, included media-derived
information on die-off of herons in Valencia, Spain. The potential aetiologies
mentioned included, among others, avian influenza and poisoning. ProMED-mail
raised the possibility that the birds might have been Cattle egrets( _Bubulcus
ibis_) rather then herons, and asked for results of laboratory tests. No
response has been obtained.
A follow-up, applying media search and personal enquiries, was kindly carried
out by Pablo Nart, who reported the following data on 16 Feb 2006. We regret
the delayed in posting. - Mod.AS]

Samples from the affected birds were sent to different laboratories in the
country for toxicological, pathological, and microbiological examination. The
Ministry of Agriculture (MAPA) Central Laboratories in Algete, Madrid
(Laboratorio de Sanidad y Produccion Animal) is in charge of analyzing and
reporting all samples collected in Spain where avian influenza is suspected.
Results are pending.
The affected birds were, indeed, Cattle egrets (Garza bueyera, _Bubulcus
ibis_). It appears that, given the rather indiscriminate eating habits of
these birds, similar episodes are not uncommon in the area.
The Valencia wetlands, Albufera, where this event was reported, was classified
in October 2005 as an avian influenza risk area. Consequently, systematic
surveillance is applied there, including regular fecal and blood sample
collection from susceptible species.
