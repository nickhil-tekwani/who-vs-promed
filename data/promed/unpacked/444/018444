Increased Incidence of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in Switzerland
---------------------------------------------------------------
In the 13 Jul 2002 issue of the Lancet, Markus Glatzel, Colette Rogivue,
Azra Ghani, Johannes R Streffer, Lorenz Amsler and Adriano Aguzzi report
an increase in the incidence of [sporadic] Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)
in Switzerland. The abstract of their research letter reads as follows: "
The incidence of CJD in Switzerland increased two-fold in 2001, and figures
from the first quarter of 2002 indicate that it continues to rise. Neither
age at onset nor duration of disease were different from previous years.
Genetic analysis of the 27 reported cases revealed only one
disease-associated mutation in the prion gene. None of the recognized risk
factors for acquired CJD were reported on the official notification forms.
Glycotype profiling, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry indicate that
none of the cases fulfilled the definition of variant CJD, which is thought
to be caused by bovine prions. Several scenarios could account for the
increase in CJD, including improved reporting, iatrogenic transmission, and
transmission of a
prion zoonosis."

[Sporadic CJD is evenly distributed worldwide, with an incidence of about
one in a million per year. In Switzerland, however, the incidence rate has
risen over the past 2 years and appears to be increasing. The authors
consider that the relatively large number of individuals with CJD in 2001,
compared with previous years, is unlikely to be due to chance fluctuation
(Poisson probability 0·004, assuming constant incidence), and the quarterly
incidence data are better fit by an increasing exponential trend than by
assuming constant incidence (figure 1, p=0·02).
The rise in incidence of CJD in Switzerland over the past 2 years could be
a result of ascertainment bias; i.e., increased awareness of the disease
might have led to enhanced detection of CJD in patients who would have
otherwise been misdiagnosed. Furthermore, in Switzerland the mere
suspicion, rather than the diagnosis, of CJD became statutorily notifiable
in March, 1999. However the authors do not consider that this is an
adequate explanation. An ascertainment bias hypothesis would postulate that
the true average incidence of sporadic CJD is 3 or more per million per
year, indicating that all countries other than Switzerland are
under-reporting by more than 50% the number of CJD patients diagnosed every
year.
Genetic inheritance of CJD is unlikely to have contributed to the rise in
mortality from this disease, since familial instances of CJD co-segregate
with PRNP mutations, and the authors considered this explanation
incompatible with their data. One PRNP allele had a mutation associated
with hereditary dominant CJD; all other sequenced alleles had wild-type
sequences. The type 4 glycotype of the disease-associated prion protein
PrPSc which is characteristic of BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy)
and vCJD was absent. Cortical florid PrP plaques characteristic of vCJD
were not observed. Iatrogenic transmission could also be discounted because
none of the patients had been exposed to recognized risk factors.
Finally the authors consider the possibility that CJD in Switzerland is
related to a prion epizootic, and pay considerable attention to this
possibility since between 1995 and 1998, Switzerland reported a larger
incidence of BSE than did all other continental European countries (415
cases between 1990 and 2002). Exposure to BSE-infected products might have
taken place mainly before high-risk bovine food products were banned from
the human food chain in 1990. However, BSE is thought to cause variant CJD
[abbreviated as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail] rather than sporadic
CJD, yet all evidence indicates that none of the Swiss cases fulfill the
diagnostic criteria of vCJD. Swiss CJD could be related to BSE only if the
strain of Swiss BSE prion differs from the strain of BSE prevalent in the
UK. Available data, though limited, suggest that this is not the case.
At present there is no evidence that the Swiss CJD cases might result from
transmission of BSE to people after one or more serial passages through
species other than cattle. Scrapie is exceedingly rare in Switzerland: only
7 cases have been reported in the past 10 years. Chronic wasting disease of
deer has not been reported in Europe, although surveillance data on
transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in European game are incomplete.
All recognized clinical and molecular markers combine to indicate that none
of the Swiss patients developed vCJD. The authors conclude that the
elucidation of the underlying chain of events is a national research
priority, and may uncover previously unrecognized modes of prion infection
and transmission. It remains to be seen whether this increase in the
incidence of CJD in Switzerland will be sustained, or whether it represent
a statistical anomaly. According to Will RG, et al. (Ann Neurol 1998; 43:
763-767) there was a doubling in the annual death rates for sporadic CJD in
the United Kingdom between the 1980s and the 1990s, and similar increases
in the apparent death rates for sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease had
occurred in other European countries, attributable to improvement in
diagnosis. - Mod.CP]
