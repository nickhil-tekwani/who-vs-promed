Two cutaneous anthrax patients in East-Kazakhstan oblast (14 Jun
2001), and 2 cutaneous anthrax patients in South-Kazakhstan oblast (30
Jun 2001) were registered. Patients were participants of slaughter of an
anthrax-infected calf (EK patients) and a goat (SK patient). At present all
contacts and patients are healthy.

[The East Kazakhstan cases were reported earlier -- see 20010626.1216. A
question though: How many livestock cases had there been to produce these
human cutaneous cases? In western Europe the normal ratio is about 10 dead
cows per human case; in Zambia it is about 10 human cases per dead cow,
sometimes >50 human cases per dead cow. And in Kazakhstan? Obviously there
must be a slaughtered goat/cow/sheep to initiate the human clinical cases,
but does every anthrax goat produce a human case? I very much doubt it. In
my experience a number of sheep and goats will have died before the first
human case occurs, and that may be in relation to the third or fourth flock
to be affected in a village. But what happens in Kazakhstan? This is one of
the problems when the most active group is the medical public health
agency. The emphasis gets put on the human cases, which are incidental to
the real problem: livestock anthrax. And anthrax in calves is unusual but
this may be a translation problem. - Mod.MHJ
