Belgium (12 Dec 1999)
The number of influenza A isolates has gradually increased, together with
the level
of acute respiratory infection which has gone beyond theepidemic threshold.
Germany (4 Dec 1999)
Influenza A(H3N2) activity is increasing slightly, with a higher number of
isolates being reported in Marburg.
Ireland (10 Dec 1999)
A local outbreak of influenza A in a hospital ward of immunocompromised
patients was reported during the first week of December.
United Kingdom (11 Dec 1999)
There were 3 outbreaks in a hospital in south-eastern England. So far,
isolates have been A(H3N2), similar to the vaccine strain. Influenza
activity is just below the baseline threshold.
United States of America (4 Dec 1999)
During the first week of December, 18% of specimens tested for influenza
were positive. State and territorial epidemiologists from 9 states and
Puerto Rico reported regional influenza activity, while other states and
the District of Columbia reported sporadic influenza activity. Virus
isolates were mainly influenza A non-subtyped and influenza A(H3N2).

Austria: No sign of influenza activity.
Belgium: ARI at epidemic levels. Local outbreaks of influenza, so far 56
detections/isolations of influenza A virus.
Bulgaria: No report so far.
Croatia: No report so far.
Czech Republic: Increasing ARI level, especially in the eastern & northern
parts of the country. First influenza A isolate during week 99/50.
Denmark: Influenza activity at non epidemic level. One imported case due to
an A/Moscow/10/99(H3N2)-like strain.
Finland: Sporadic influenza activity due to influenza A viruses (so far 6
virus isolations/detections)
France: Influenza activity reached epidemic levels in many regions.
Activity at regional levels in the northern part of the country and still
at local levels in the southern part. Activity due to A(H3N2) viruses
antigenically related to A/Sydney/5/97.
Germany: Slight increase of ARI levels. Sporadic influenza activity due to
A/H3 viruses.
Greece: Low influenza activity. No antigen detection nor isolation so far.
Hungary: No report so far.
Italy: Low influenza activity. Three A(H3N2) isolates in Northern Italy.
Lithuania: ARI and Influenza activity at non epidemic levels. No virus
detection/isolation so far.
The Nethelands: Influenza activity at non epidemic levels. Three influenza A
isolates reported, one being characterised as antigenically related to
A/Sydney/5/97(H3N2).
Norway: Influenza activity at non epidemic levels. One influenza A
detection (week 99/42)
Poland: Stationnary ILI levels during the first 2 weeks of December. 2
influenza A viruses and 2 influenza B viruses detected during this period.
Portugal: Influenza activity due to type A viruses: weeks 99/47 to 99/50.
Romania: ARI levels slightly increasing but no detection/isolation of
influenza virus so far.
Slovak Republic: ARI at seasonnal levels. No virus detections/isolatrion so
far.
Spain: Sporadic influenza activity.
Sweden: No report so far.
Switzerland: Slight increase in ILI levels. Local influenza activity due to
A(H3N2) viruses related to A/Sydney/5/97 &/or A/Moscow/10/99.
Russia and CIS: Influenza activity at non epidemic level. So far: 5 antigen
detections were positive for influenza A(H3N2) and 2 for influenza A(H1N1).
Great Britain: ILI levels "within the range of baseline activity" in
England & Wales, while "normal seasonnal activity" is reported in Scotland.
Influenza activity due to A(H3N2) viruses antigenically similar to
A/Sydney/5/97(H3N2) and closely related to the more recent strain
A/Moscow/10/99(H3N2.

Flu cases on the rise Cases of flu have risen dramatically [in Britain]
over the holiday period, leaving thousands of people ill - and causing
British Airways to cancel flights because of staff shortages. Visits to GPs
for cold and flu-like symptoms have risen to 68 per 100 000 of the
population. And British Airways has been forced to cancel a number of long
haul flights because so many cabin crew have called in sick. We do seem to
be in the middle of some sort of a flu epidemic Dr Grant Kelly Most of the
cases of flu are of the Sydney strain, which was predicted to be the main
cause of problems this year. Vaccination programs for the over-75s have
been run as flu can prove fatal, particularly for the elderly. No
unexpected strains have so far been detected. Dr Grant Kelly, a GP in West
Sussex, said: "We do seem to be in the middle of some sort of a flu
epidemic, purely looking at the number of people we have seen over the past
couple of days. "It started just before Christmas and then took off. But it
is a fairly trivial form of flu, which lasts two to three days and is just
a nuisance." A spokeswoman for British Airways said the flights cancelled
were ones where there was another service leaving shortly afterwards and
there had been "minimum disruption" to passengers. Outbreak The Public
Health Laboratory Service (PHLS), which collects figures on cold and flu,
says the outbreak is within the range of "normal seasonal activity",
despite the rise. A rate of above 400 cases per 100 000 people would be an
official epidemic. A spokesman for the PHLS said: "We would expect
continued influenza activity over the next few weeks although no reliable
prediction can be made about the level of activity that may be seen." Dr
Kelly warned that people were not taking advice issued by the Department of
Health before Christmas not to contact their GP except in serious cases.
Anyone with suspected flu is advised to rest, drink plenty of fluids and
take analgesics. Medical advice should be sought if symptoms become severe
or last more than a week. People with chronic or long standing illness may
need to see a doctor earlier.
