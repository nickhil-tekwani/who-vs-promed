[Although most of reports from ProMED-mail have been from East and
Southern Africa, Lumpy Skin Disease does indeed occur in West Africa.
I have seen it many times in Nigeria and it can be widespread within a
herd of cattle and affect many herds in a given area. This viral
disease caused by a capripoxvirus, was 1st described in Zimbabwe in
1929 and has spread throughout Africa. Recently, countries in the
Middle East have been affected.

The disease affects cattle and is characterized by skin nodules with
lymphadenitis accompanied by a persistent fever. Production losses can
be significant. This disease is associated with biting flies and the
rainy season.

A full description of the disease can be found at USAHA's Grey Book,
