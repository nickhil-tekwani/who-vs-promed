World Health Organization Links Pneumonia Outbreak in China to
Transcontinental Flu-Like Illness
------------------------
BEIJING - The World Health Organization for the first time has linked a
pneumonia outbreak in China to a mystery flu-like illness that has hit
other countries on three continents. The global death toll from the
combined outbreaks climbed to 52 on Wednesday.
Chinese authorities said the disease has killed at least 34 people in China
since [30 Nov 2002] in the south and 3 in Beijing. Hundreds have been
infected. Previously, they said only 5 had died in southern Guangdong province.
World health officials later said the symptoms of the Chinese illness are
consistent with those for severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which
has sickened nearly 500 people and killed 18 elsewhere 10 in Hong Kong, 4
in Vietnam, 3 in Canada and one in Singapore.
"Everything we've seen so far indicates it's the same disease," said Dr.
Meirion Evans, a member of a WHO team that has studied the cases in
southern China, but not yet those in Beijing. "We're getting a more
complete picture," Evans told the Associated Press. "It's certainly been
one of the objectives of the mission to clarify whether the outbreak in
China was the same disease as what's been seen outside of China.
The WHO has called on Beijing to be more cooperative.
Chinese officials said previously that 305 people were sickened in the
atypical pneumonia outbreak.
But a spokeswoman for the Guangzhou city government, who identified herself
only by the surname Ye, said Wednesday [25 Mar 2003] that 792 cases of
atypical pneumonia were reported in the province by the end of February
2003, with 680 in the capital Guangzhou.
Ye said 31 people in Guangdong had died by the end of February 2003. Three
others died in Beijing this month [Mar 2003], the city said Wednesday [25
Mar 2003].

Guangdong Reports Progress in Combating Atypical Pneumonia
-----------------------
The Health Bureau of south China's Guangdong Province announced Wednesday
that notable progress had been made in controlling and treating atypical
pneumonia. 75 percent of patients suffering from atypical pneumonia had
recovered and been discharged from hospital thanks to effective medical
treatment, said a bureau spokesman.
The first case of atypical pneumonia in Guangdong occurred in Foshan City
on 16 Nov 2002. After that more were found in the cities of Heyuan,
Zhongshan, Jiangmen, Shenzhen and Zhaoqing.
Altogether 112 people reportedly contracted the potentially fatal
respiratory disease in the 6 cities. Of the total, 7 died of concurrent
infections, and the rest were cured and discharged from hospital. The
epidemic had been brought under full control in the 6 cities and no fresh
cases had been reported in those areas since 15 Feb 2003, said the spokesman.
In Guangzhou, the provincial capital, the first cases of atypical pneumonia
were reported in late January 2003 and it reached a peak in early February
2003. By late February 2003, 680 cases of atypical pneumonia had been
diagnosed in Guangzhou and 24 people died, said the spokesman. But he
emphasized that there had been a drastic drop in the number of fresh cases
in the provincial capital since the beginning of this month and patients
suffering from atypical pneumonia had received timely and proper treatment.
The cause of atypical pneumonia is still being investigated. Medical
experts here said early diagnosis and treatment are essential to ensure a
high recovery rate for patients of atypical pneumonia.

[This is the first "official" confirmation of the outbreak of SARS-like
illness occurring in Southern China pre-dating the onset of illness in Hong
Kong and Vietnam (see ProMED-mail postings below: Pneumonia - China
(Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357, Undiagnosed illness - Vietnam (Hanoi): RFI
20030311.0595 and Acute respiratory syndrome - China (HK), VietNam
20030312.0602). Clearly we await more official technical information on
this outbreak including the epidemiology, laboratory studies, treatment and
efficacy of control measures to date. A key question surrounds the ease of
transmissibility and whether the outbreak in China also followed the
observations that close contact was necessary for transmission. The second
news wire gives more detailed information of the early stages of the
outbreak, mentioning it was first identified in Foshan city in mid Nov.
2002. The above news wire does not discuss the current status of the
outbreak. The current status of this outbreak remains unclear. While the
number of "fresh cases" may have decreased in Guangdong, there is no
mention if there have been cases outside Guangdong Province, assuming that
internal travel within China does occur with significant frequency. - Mod.MPP]
