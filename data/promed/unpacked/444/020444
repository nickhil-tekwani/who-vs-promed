A popular and deadly disease caused by [a virus in] rodents, Lassa fever, has killed 10 persons and infected 28 others in Plateau state, Nigeria.

Naija News reports that Plateau State commissioner for health Dr Kunden Deyin, while confirming the cases of the fever, said that 64 cases were taken to the laboratory for confirmation; of these, 28 were confirmed to be Lassa fever. According to Deyin, the state has recorded 28 new cases of Lassa fever with 10 deaths.

Deyin's remarks came on [Thu 21 Feb 2019], when he confirmed that the cases were imported from Kaduna state, adding that some patients of the fever are already responding to treatment.

"Lassa fever presents like any other fever, with symptoms such as headache, body pain, and a general feeling of being unwell. Therefore, anyone who is feeling feverish should visit the hospital immediately. Prompt presentation is the key to reducing the mortality rate associated with the disease, but most times, patients do come to the hospitals late.

"However, all health workers should make referrals to other health facilities such as the tertiary health facilities, when they cannot handle cases like Lassa fever that require prompt medical attention," he added.

Deyin also advised that people should learn to keep their environment clean and ensure that it is not rodent-friendly so as to avoid further reoccurrence of the fever; he also advised residents to store all grains in rodent-proof containers.

[There have been several reported Lassa fever cases in Plateau state so far this year (2019):

Date reported in 2019 / Number of cases
6 Jan / 1
27 Jan / 5
3 Feb / 4
10 Feb / 4
17 Feb / 2
Total / 16

That total has now increased to 38 (10 dead and 28 others) per the above report. Lassa fever virus transmission is currently very active in the state. This is well into the usual active virus transmission season (December-June).

Transmission of Lassa fever virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir hosts' excreta or are within healthcare facilities. Community involvement to reduce exposure to the rodent host is a challenge. A proactive public education effort is required to encourage use of containers that prevent rodent access to food materials and blocking of entry points of the rodents into houses.

These rodents can live near or in people's houses. - Mod.TY
