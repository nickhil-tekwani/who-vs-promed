State conservation officials are asking deer hunters heading out for
the start of bow hunting season Saturday [13 Oct 2007] in the state's
southern zone to report any sick, dying or dead animals as part of an
investigation into whether a disease has reached New York.

The state Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) said
preliminary tests on 2 of about 20 deer found dead this week around
Voorheesville in southern Albany County indicate that they may have
died of epizootic hemorrhagic disease, or EHD. Samples are pending
with national laboratories for confirmation. They would the 1st
confirmed cases in New York state.

The disease -- which doesn't pose a known threat to human health --
causes hemorrhaging and has mostly afflicted white-tailed deer in the
southeast, the DEC said. It was reported in mid-Atlantic states this
summer [2007], is transmitted by certain types of biting flies in
late summer and fall, and subsides as weather turns cold and the
flies die.

Officials are still waiting for test results from 2 other
laboratories but say if the deer did die from EHD, it would be the
1st time the disease has been found in the state. The deer are also
being tested for rabies, chronic wasting disease, and possible
poisoning, the agency said.

An insect-borne disease that has been killing white-tailed deer
throughout North America cannot be contracted by humans and is not a
significant threat to the state's deer herd, state environmental
officials said.

Epizootic hemorrhagic disease, which causes hemorrhaging and
typically kills deer that contract it within 5 days, is transmitted
by small insects called midges, the Department of Natural Resources
and Environmental Control's (DNREC) Division of Fish and Wildlife
said.

Humans can't contract the disease, DNREC said, although they should
avoid consuming the meat of deer that appear visibly sick, due to the
risk of a secondary infection that could be harmful to humans.

At least 75 deer in Delaware have died from the disease, and deer in
neighboring states have fared worse; in Pennsylvania, several
thousand deer have died, DNREC said.

Pesticides can't be used to kill the flies that cause the disease,
nor can deer be vaccinated against it. "We are in a position of
allowing nature to run its course and waiting for a hard frost to
kill the midges," said Joe Rogerson, a Division of Fish and Wildlife
game mammal biologist.

Anyone who encounters a deer carcass whose cause of death is not
apparent should contact Rogerson at 735-3600; the division is
attempting to document deer mortality for future references to the
disease.

[New York and Delaware are reasonably far north to be finding the
disease this late in the season, although many areas have been seeing
seasonal heat waves and frost has not occurred in many areas where it
normally would have been seen by this time of the year. New York is
large enough, and with Pennsylvania as its neighbor, it is not
uncommon to expect the disease in this state. Nonetheless, it is
rather late in the year to be finding it.
