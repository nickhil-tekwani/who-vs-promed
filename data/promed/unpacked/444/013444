LISTERIOSIS, FATAL - USA (12): CANTALOUPE

Jensen Farms is not near Rocky Ford, Colorado. While it's often
helpful to have a map link to the area of an outbreak, the map on
ProMED-mail post from issue 492 links to the town of Rocky Ford [CO].
However, the source of the _Listeria_ outbreak, Jensen Farms, is near
Holly, Colorado, which is nearly 100 miles [161 km] and 2 counties
away. The Rocky Ford region of Colorado can be found on a map at
http://g.co/maps/prqf4.

The cantaloupe growers around Rocky Ford have been devastated
economically by the outbreak associated with Jensen farms, even though
they were not involved in this outbreak. See
http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_19084937. It would be helpful in
future posts not to target the Rocky Ford town or immediate region,
which was not the source of the _Listeria_ outbreak.

[ProMED-mail thanks Adrienne LeBailly for bringing to our attention
that Holly, Colorado, where Jensen Farm is located, is nearly 90 miles
(145 km) to the east of Rocky Ford, Colorado. The 2 towns along Route
50 can be seen on the map accessed at http://g.co/maps/mpq3d. The
town of Holly is in Prowers County in south eastern Colorado, 4 miles
(6.5 km) from the Kansas border
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holly,_Colorado) and Rocky Ford is in
Otero County, Colorado
(http://www.digital-topo-maps.com/county-map/colorado.shtml). Bent
County separates Otero from Prowers County.

Initially cantaloupe from the Rocky Ford region of south eastern
Colorado was the suspected vehicle (ProMED-mail post Listeriosis,
fatal - USA (03) 20110914.2800). Subsequently cantaloupe involved in
the listeriosis outbreak was traced specifically to cantaloupe from
Jensen Farm, which labeled its cantaloupe with the Rocky Ford name.
The FDA identified the recalled whole cantaloupes from Jensen Farm as
having a green and white sticker that reads: "Product of USA-Frontera
Produce-Colorado Fresh-Rocky Ford-Cantaloupe" or a gray, yellow, and
green sticker that reads "Jensen Farms-Sweet Rocky Fordsâ€š"
(http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm271879.htm). Photos of the
labeling can be seen at
http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm271882.htm. Cantaloupe from
other farms in this region of south eastern Colorado have not been
implicated in this outbreak. - Mod.ML]
