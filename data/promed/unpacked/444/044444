Health Department sounds alert on anthrax
-----------------------------------------
The Health Department has sounded an alert on the consumption and
handling of meat as the tests conducted on carcasses of wild boars
found on the premises of the Kerala Police Academy [in Thrissur] have
confirmed anthrax.

Carcasses of 2 wild boars were found on the campus of the academy at
Ramavarmapuram [Thrissur] last week [week of 1 Mar 2011]. Last year
[2010], the carcasses of 7 wild boars, an eagle, and a toddy cat were
found on the academy campus.

According to the Animal Husbandry Department sources, the wild boars
must have got infected from the anthrax spores that remained active in
the soil. _Bacillus anthracis_ spores can live in soil for years. The
veterinary experts, however, suspect that the wild [boars] may have
been infected from the animal waste often dumped in the forest areas.

The entry of infected animals from neighbouring states through
illegal routes is a real concern, they add. There were some
unconfirmed reports that cadavers of some pigs were found in Puthur
area 2 weeks ago. Anthrax, caused by the spore-forming bacteria _B.
anthracis_, affects wild and domestic lower vertebrates (cattle,
sheep, goats, camels, antelopes, and other herbivores).

The Animal Husbandry Department sources say that there is no cause
for alarm. "Precautionary measures have been made to control the
disease. Animals in the nearby areas of the academy have been
immunised," they add.

[This event is virtually identical with that in March 2010 so
patently the problem has not been resolved. A logical conclusion from
the limited information available is that these pigs have access to
"animal waste" including the carcasses of animals dying of anthrax,
which had not been properly investigated. Pigs are moderately
resistant to infection with _B. anthracis_ and most commonly become
infected from scavenging dead animals and tossed viscera.

One can ask why they would check dead pigs if they are ignoring prior
dead livestock and horses, but I suppose it comes down to where they
drop dead. A dead pig on the back doorstep of the police academy may
be hard to ignore. One can hope that it will be more completely
investigated this time and appropriate actions taken, including
vaccinating local livestock. - Mod.MHJ
