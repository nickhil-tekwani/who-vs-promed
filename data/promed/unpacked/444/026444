According to the Omsk Oblast Center for Hygiene and Epidemiology, in
September 2008, 159 patients (compared with 71 in August 2008)
attended the Centre for Rapid Tick-borne Encephalitis (TBE) Diagnosis,
126 of whom had received tick bites. Ticks were investigated, and 5 of
them were discovered with TBE virus antigen [showing they were
infected].

32 samples of serum were also investigated for the presence of TBE
virus antibodies, and 4 gave positive results. The positive ticks
originated from the Omsk Novovarshavsk region, and the positive human
sera were determined in patients from the Omsk Gorkovsk region.

[Despite an end to the tick season, there are still cases of
tick-borne encephalitis in some regions of Russia, and there have
been some ticks discovered with the virus for tick-borne
encephalitis. Under these circumstances, people should continue to
protect themselves against ticks while outdoors and on forest trips.
