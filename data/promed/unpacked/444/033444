An outbreak of staphylococcal foodborne illnesses in Canada has prompted the recall of some frozen breaded chicken breast strips. There is no more information about the outbreak; it was just mentioned in the recall notice. We do not know how many people are sick, their ages, their status, if anyone has been hospitalized, or where they live.

The recalled product is Maple Leaf Foods Maple Leaf brand Chicken Breast Strips in 840 gram packages. The best before date is 2018 SE 29, and the UPC number on the product is 0 63100 03089 6.

The chicken may contain the toxin produced by _Staphylococcus aureus_. This bacterium is found on the skin and in the nose of about 25% of healthy people and animals. The bacterium itself doesn't cause the foodborne illness but the toxin can make you sick. The organism is salt tolerant, so it can grow in foods that don't allow other types of bacterial growth. As the bacterium grows it produces toxins. And those toxins cannot be destroyed by cooking.

This illness is fast acting. Most people get sick within 30 minutes to 6 hours after ingesting the toxin. Symptoms usually include vomiting, nausea, stomach cramps, and rarely diarrhea. This illness is not contagious, so it can't be spread person-to-person and usually only lasts for a day. Severe illnesses are rare, although some people may need medical treatment for dehydration. If you purchased this product, do not eat it. Throw it away in a sealed or double bagged package, or take it back to the store where you bought it for a full refund.

[The following information regarding this entity is extracted from the US Food and Drug Administration's Bad Bug Book available at: http://www.fda.gov/food/foodborneillnesscontaminants/causesofillnessbadbugbook/ucm070015.htm:

"In the diagnosis of staphylococcal foodborne illness, proper interviews with the victims and the gathering and analyzing of epidemiological data, are essential. Incriminated foods should be collected and examined for staphylococci. The presence of relatively large numbers of enterotoxigenic staphylococci is good circumstantial evidence that the food contains toxin. The most conclusive test is the linking of an illness with a specific food, or, in cases where multiple vehicles exist, the detection of the toxin in the food sample(s).

"In cases where the food may have been treated to kill the staphylococci, as in pasteurization or heating, direct microscopic observation of the food may be an aid in the diagnosis. A number of serological methods for determining the enterotoxigenicity of _S. aureus_ isolated from foods, as well as methods for the separation and detection of toxins in foods, have been developed, and used successfully, to aid in the diagnosis of the illness. Phage typing may also be useful when viable staphylococci can be isolated from the incriminated food, from victims, and from suspected carriers, such as food handlers.

"A toxin dose of less than 1.0 microgram in contaminated food will produce symptoms of staphylococcal intoxication. This toxin level is reached when _S. aureus_ populations exceed 100 000 per gram.

"Foods that are frequently incriminated in staphylococcal food poisoning include meat and meat products; poultry and egg products; salads such as egg, tuna, chicken, potato, and macaroni; bakery products such as cream-filled pastries, cream pies, and chocolate eclairs; sandwich fillings; and milk and dairy products. Foods that require considerable handling during preparation, and that are kept at slightly elevated temperatures after preparation, are frequently involved in staphylococcal food poisoning."

A very short incubation of a vomiting-associated illness (less than one hour) also suggests that the etiology might have been heavy metal ingestion. A number of metals can cause this type of syndrome, which is usually caused by the ingestion of a liquid that had been kept in a metallic container. These metals include antimony, copper, tin, and zinc. The illnesses are usually self-limiting and require only symptomatic care. In addition to vomiting, other clues may include the liquid being described as having a metallic taste. Identifying the specific cause requires analysis of the food or liquid vehicle. Some potential differences in the illnesses exist between causes, including a longer incubation period (several hours) for zinc; vomiting and diarrhea for tin; and blue or green vomitus for copper. - Mod.LL
