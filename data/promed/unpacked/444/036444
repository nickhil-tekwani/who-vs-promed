Livestock disease found in elk southeast of Dillon

BILLINGS, Mont. - Blood tests on elk captured southeast of Dillon found 5 animals exposed to brucellosis in an area where the livestock disease previously was unknown. The test results were released Thursday as part of a long-term study of brucellosis and elk by Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks biologists.

Eradicated elsewhere in the country, brucellosis persists in wildlife in the region around Yellowstone National Park. The disease can spread to cattle and cause infected pregnant animals to miscarry.

Last year, brucellosis found in elk in the Ruby Range prompted an expansion of a special disease zone where ranchers face increased testing and vaccine requirements.

But state veterinarian Marty Zaluski says no cattle spend winter where the latest infections were found. That means the state may not expand the disease zone.

In 2010 the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks indicated that the seroprevalence from a range of 0-2 to 5- 16 percent in elk. They proposed to capture a hundred elk a year from different areas bordering the Yellowstone National Park. They proposed collaring and tracking at least 30 elk out of each group of 100. This was to continue for 4 years.

They should be in year 2 of this study. So, at least in theory they should have some idea of where the elk vs cattle are. We look forward to hearing more results of the 2010 study and how it will help them combat brucellosis in the cervids. – Mod.TG]
