Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is the most prevelant natural focal non-transmissible infection, accounting for more than 90% of all hemorrhagic fevers registered in the Russian Federation.

In the Republic of Karelia in January-November 2022, the incidence of HFRS is twice as high as in the same period in 2021, and 1.8 times that in 2020. For 11 months of 2022, 9 cases of HFRS were registered in the Republic of Karelia, including 1 in a child. In 2021, 4 adult cases were registered, and in 2022 [I suspect this should read 2020. - Mod.SH], 5 adult cases.

The incidence in 2022 amounted to 1.3 per 100 000 of the population, which is 27.4% lower than the average long-term incidence in 2012-2021 (1.79 per 100 000 population).

Data for the first 11 months of 2022 show the incidence of HFRS in the republic to be 78% higher than the incidence of HFRS for the same period in the Northwestern Federal District (0.73 per 100 000 population), and 52.9% higher than in the Russian Federation as a whole.

HFRS is an acute infectious disease characterized by selective damage to blood vessels and proceeding with fever, malaise, and kidney damage.

HFRS is a severe, natural, and focal zoonosis. Currently, the causative agent of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome belongs to the Bunyavirus family (Bunyaviridae) and is isolated in a separate genus _Hantavirus_.

The reservoir of the pathogen is mouse-like rodents. In the European part of Russia, the bank vole is the source of infection. In cities, house rats and mice are likely to be reservoirs of infection.

Human infection occurs mainly by airborne dust (up to 80%), and by inhalation of dried feces of infected rodents. Transmission of the virus is also possible by contact, through damaged skin and mucous membranes, in contact with rodents, or infected environmental objects (firewood, straw, hay, etc.). The possibility of human infection through the alimentary route is possible, for example, when consumed products that have not been subjected to heat treatment (cabbage, carrots, etc.) are contaminated by infected rodents. There is no person-to-person transmission of the infection. The incidence of HFRS is characterized by pronounced seasonality, from May to December.

People of any age are susceptible to HFRS, but men aged 20-50 are more likely to get sick. Male citizens in recent years account for 50-70% of the cases. Infection often occurs when visiting the forest, or working on a garden plot. The risk group includes loggers, hunters, and geologists.

The gateway of infection is the mucous membrane of the respiratory tract, less often the skin and mucous membrane of the digestive system. At the site of the infection entry, no significant changes are observed. The initial manifestations of the disease are due to viremia and systemic involvement. The main element in the pathogenesis of the disease is the defeat of the integrity of the vascular wall, although the state of the coagulation and anticoagulation systems also plays a certain role in the development of hemorrhagic syndrome.

The epidemiological manifestation of HFRS foci, in addition to natural ones, is also influenced by social factors (the development of the dacha complex over the past 15 years, an increase in the area of uncultivated land, an increase in the number of people who harvest mushrooms and berries). Thus, in the territory of the European part of Russia, social changes only increase the impact of natural factors on the epidemic situation in HFRS.

Preventive measures include:
- improvement of the forest park territory;
- barrier and house rodent elimination on the territory of natural foci;
- sanitary-educational work among the population.

The main measure for the prevention of HFRS remains non-specific prophylaxis aimed at reducing the number of rodents and protecting people from contact with rodents or objects contaminated with their secretions.

In settlements located near the forest, it is necessary to store products in warehouses protected from rodents. The area near housing should be free of shrubs and weeds.

[The Republic of Karelia is located in far western Russia, adjoining the border with Finland. Although not mentioned specifically, Puumala hantavirus infections are not unusual in northwestern Europe and are the likely etiological agent in the HFRS cases in Karelia. The rodent host for this virus is the bank vole (_Myodes glareolus_) which is mentioned in the report above. Also possible is Seoul virus that is distributed worldwide in the brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_). Although case fatality rates with Puumala virus infection are low, a recent retrospective autopsy study of 41 fatal cases in Udmurtia, also in western Russia, indicated that the case fatality rate of HFRS (0.4%) was much higher than that reported in another European hotspot of HFRS, where Germany and Finland had case fatality rates of 0.05% and 0.08%, respectively. The report states that "this difference may be attributed to 3 reasons. First, it can be explained by the known genetic diversity of PUUV. Second, since only hospitalized patients are tested for HFRS in Russia, the real case fatality rate is probably lower because of an unknown number of milder cases. Third, unfortunately, national clinical guidelines for the management of HFRS have some disagreements with international standards of care for the management of septic shock, ARDS, and acute kidney injury."
