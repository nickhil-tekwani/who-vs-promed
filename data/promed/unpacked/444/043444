Since 1st observed in Turkey in 2002, 92 people have died of
Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in the country, including 27
so far this year [2008]. The fever is much more prevalent in the
central Anatolian and eastern Anatolian provinces, especially Tokat,
Corum, Sivas, Amasya, Yozgat and Gumushane. Cases of CCHF are
increasing year by year, a fact that Associate Professor Zati
Vatansever says is due to lack of awareness of the disease in rural
areas, where it is most common.

CCHF seems to be the new threat to the Turkish population. Experts
say the disease, whose victims have increased 5-fold in the last 5
years, will become an even bigger problem in coming years. Seen 6
years ago for the 1st time in Turkey, CCHF has killed 134 people in
the country thus far. Infecting 2 doctors and one other medical staff
member at the Ankara Numune Education and Research Hospital, the
seriousness of disease has reached an alarming point.

CCHF entered world medical literature back in the 1940s. In the
summer of 1944, it was seen in Russian soldiers transporting
agricultural products in Western Crimea for the 1st time. In 1956,
the same disease was witnessed in Congo, which is how the disease got
its name. The history of the disease in Turkey does not go back that
far; CCHF was 1st observed here in the summer of 2002. Esra Demir, in
2002 working as a nurse at the Tokat Social Security Authority (SSK)
Hospital, suddenly felt unwell and was taken to the Ankara Hacettepe
University Hospital. Despite all the attempts to treat her, she died
after one week, and her reason of death was recorded as unknown.
However, 6 more people died in a short period in Tokat, a province in
the Black Sea region, and the deaths were announced as "deaths with
unknown reasons" to the media. The Ministry of Health at first
thought that this unknown disease resembled Q fever, a disease caused
by infection with the bacterium _Coxiella burnetii_. Yet upon finding
that the symptoms were not quite the same as those of Q fever, blood
samples were sent to the laboratories of the Pasteur Institute in
France. The tests conducted there finally confirmed that the disease was CCHF.

Detection of 327 CCHF cases in Tokat province shows that it is one of
the most affected regions in Turkey. Thus, the question arises, why
Tokat? To understand this, we must explore the conditions causing the
disease in the province and the characteristics of infected ticks.
Vatansever, associate professor at the department of parasitology at
the veterinary school of Kafkas University, has been conducting
research on ticks since 1989. And since 2004, when the disease began
to spread, the professor has been analyzing CCHF-infected ticks and
the domestic and wild animals that carry them. There are 850 tick
species in the world, with 32 of them present in Turkey; however, not
all ticks carry the CCHF virus. The virus is carried by ticks of the
[genus] _Hyalomma_. Virus-carrying ticks lodge in small wild animals
such as mice or rabbits and in wild birds. They mature on these
smaller animals and then move on to large wild animals, cattle and
people. After the ticks feed on their host, they detach themselves,
and while male ticks die soon thereafter, females die after laying
their eggs. Stating that the real threat is posed by female ticks,
Vatansever noted: "3 to 5 percent of eggs of a tick bearing the CCHF
virus are also contaminated. In this sense, female ticks present more
of a threat than males." Unless ticks find a suitable host, they live
for an average of one year. In temperatures of 16-18 C, their life
spans can extend up to 3 years. The characteristics of virus-carrying
ticks are different from other ticks. The ticks of the [genus]
_Hyalomma_ are also known as hunters. These ticks burrow into soil,
unlike many other ticks that live on plants. They can feel vibrations
and heat, while also being able to smell and identify carbon dioxide
from exhalation. Vatansever noted that the infected ticks attach
themselves to people who are sitting or lying down, not moving. "They
feel vibrations and sense heat and carbon dioxide emitted from people
and gravitate toward them. They start climbing from a person's feet
and look for an area on which to attach themselves." Ornithologist
Ahmet Kutukcu emphasized another crucial point. He said migratory
birds, particularly storks, play an active role in spreading the
disease. "Yet the real host for the ticks are not birds, but
rodents," he noted.

The number of CCHF virus-transmitting ticks is increasing in the
world, and this is related to an increase in suitable conditions,
which include heat, humidity and proper hosts, Vatansever noted. He
also explained that while only 40 percent of tick species can
reproduce under normal weather conditions, the ecological changes
caused by global warming have led to warmer weather, which prolongs
the life span of ticks and facilitates their reproduction.
Virus-carrying ticks are able to survive in regions where ocean
climates -- typical of the Black Sea region -- and semi-arid climates
-- typical of central Anatolia and eastern Anatolia -- meet, and
those types of ticks prefer areas with small trees and cattle.
Conducting field studies on the range of virus-carrying ticks,
Vatansever found that Corum, Amasya, Tokat, Yozgat, Sivas, Erzurum
and Artvin are at the highest risk. The least hazardous regions are
the Mediterranean and Black Sea coasts, Vatansever said.

Taking a closer look at the deaths caused by ticks reveals that
cattle owners, farmers and shepherds are the most at-risk population.
In addition, soldiers, campers and picnickers, veterinarians, forest
workers and health staff working in infected areas are at risk. The
percentage of deaths among elderly people over 70 is also striking.

Noting that the CCHF-transmitting ticks live on cattle and wild
animals, Vatansever said it is pointless to worry about ticks in
urban areas. However, the professor complained about ignorance in
rural areas. "People in rural [areas] live with ticks from their
childhood to adulthood, and they think they know about ticks. When
they see photographs of ticks in newspapers, they say that the ticks
in the photos do not resemble those living in their villages. They
are exposed to tick bites every summer, but they remove them on their
own. The village people do not want to believe that CCHF-carrying
ticks can be fatal. And then they want to believe the nonsense
alleging that the ticks are sent from Israel. Unfortunately, it is
very hard to do away with these kinds of beliefs," he said, adding
that he believes if rural people had just a little concern over the
ticks, they could take simple measures to protect themselves.

While CCHF virus does not [usually] kill animals, it is often fatal
for people. Symptoms of the infection are sudden fever, nausea,
headache, vomiting and diarrhea. Bleeding of different parts of body
may also accompany these symptoms. Hurrem Bodur, the chief of the
Department of Infectious Diseases at Ankara Numune Hospital,
explained the course of the disease, saying: "There are platelets
circulating in the blood in the human body functioning as bleeding
clotters. But upon entering into the human body via tick bites, the
virus causes the number of platelet cells to decrease, which damages
the veins and which, in turn, causes hemorrhage. External hemorrhage
in parts like the nose and ears or internal hemorrhage, causing parts
of the body to appear bruised and purplish, may occur as a result of
decreasing platelets," Bodur said.

Experts say that disease symptoms appear within one to 3 days or 10
days at most after the virus enters a person's body. It is vital for
a patient to stay in the hospital after infection. Patients who
survive after 2 weeks become permanently immune to the disease.
Raising awareness is of crucial importance to effectively combat the disease.

[CCHF is clearly an emerging disease in Turkey, having been
responsible for the deaths of 134 people since its 1st appearance 6
years ago. According to Ministry of Health figures, the death toll
has progressed from 6 in 2002 to 13 in 2004, 13 in 2005, 27 in 2006,
33 in 2007, and 27 so far in 2008. A comprehensive education campaign
needs to be conducted to raise the awareness of the population in rural areas.

The preceding account contains interesting information concerning the
biology of the tick vector, not least the involvement of storks.
