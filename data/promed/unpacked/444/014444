A suspected human case of rabies infection was reported in October 2014. The case was a 52-year-old man from Limpopo province who sustained category 3 wounds to his legs and hands after being bitten by a neighbour's dogs [sic]. The man received treatment and a 1st dose of rabies vaccine at a nearby clinic. He was referred to a clinic nearer home for completion of post-exposure prophylaxis.

The man was admitted to hospital on 25 Oct 2014 (about a month after the exposure), with symptoms of rabies infection; he died the following day. A preliminary diagnosis of rabies was based on clinical presentation.

A total of 5 laboratory-confirmed human cases of rabies have been reported in South Africa for 2014 to date. A further 5 probable cases were also identified. All the cases resulted from dog bites and occurred in Limpopo (3), Eastern Cape (3), Mpumalanga (2) and North West (1) provinces [1 N.O.S.].

Certain areas of South Africa are of particular concern regarding animal rabies. Limpopo Province reported re-emergence of rabies in 2006, and human cases have been reported annually since. The Eastern Cape, Free State and Mpumalanga provinces report a resurgence of animal rabies in certain districts in recent years, although few human cases. In the past, KwaZulu-Natal was considered the province with the highest incidence of canine rabies and human rabies; however, following canine vaccination programmes since 2009, canine rabies is declining, and no human cases have been reported in the past 15 months.

Travellers to South Africa should be made aware of the rabies risk and be advised to avoid all contact with animals and dogs in particular. All animal bites should be reported and assessed carefully. Rabies pre-exposure vaccine is available [in the UK and probably elsewhere] for those considered to be at risk.

[If confirmed, this will be the 6th human rabies case in Limpopo Province this year, 2014. Incomplete human vaccination following exposure is a constant problem. A single shot following a severe exposure is always inadequate for the immune-naive individual. The problem comes when there is an inadequate supply of vaccine at the district clinic level, or the cost is prohibitive, or when there is doubt as to the reality of exposure or a delay in animal confirmatory diagnosis, which is why I drum it into every veterinary graduate to keep his or her [personal] rabies vaccinations up to date, quite apart from their dogs being vaccinated regularly. The South African experience in KwaZulu brings home the importance of domestic dog vaccination and the benefits therefrom: No human cases in the past 15 months.

Limpopo is the northernmost province of South Africa http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/south_africa_physio-2005.jpg and bordered by Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique, which can only add to the animal rabies risk. - Mod.MHJ
