The current (September) issue of "Disease Prevention News", a publication
of the Texas Department of Health, reports a case of anthrax in a Terrell
county goat with follow-up investigation to determine the extent of
possible human exposures.
In the months prior to identification of the disease in the goat
approximately 90 sheep, cattle and goats on the ranch had died of an
undetermined cause.
Some human exposure may have taken place but there was no documentation of
human anthrax infection.
There was a prior history of anthrax (25 years ago) at this location, at
which time the ranchers instituted annual livestock vaccination. The
current ranch owners, who bought the property 17 years ago, discontinued
this policy.
The TDH postulates that increased rainfall after four years of drought
caused rapid growth of grass which was contaminated with soil containing
the _B. anthracis_ spores, which were ingested by the animals and thus
caused disease.
The dead animal carcasses were destroyed by burning.

[As goats are essentially browsers one must always consider that they are
more likely to become infected as a result of eating leaves off surrounding
tall weeds, bushes, etc, on which blow-flies had deposited their faeces,
with anthrax spores, after feeding on an anthrax carcass. And not primarily
from grazing. MHJ
