Cysticercosis recognized as a major neglected tropical disease
--------------------------------------------------------------
Cysticercosis is now included by WHO's Department of Control of
Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) in the recently released 1st WHO
report on Neglected Tropical Diseases
(<http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2010/9789241564090_eng.pdf>)
and Summary - see page 2
(<http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2010/WHO_HTM_NTD_2010.2_eng.pdf>).

In conjunction with the NTD report a new map showing areas of the
world at risk of cysticercosis infection has also been made available
(<http://gamapserver.who.int/mapLibrary/Files/Maps/Global_cysticercosis_2009.png>) which indicates Argentina to be non-endemic with only imported
cases.

[ProMED thanks Dr Willingham for this further information on
cysticercosis and the situation in Argentina. The fact that Argentina
has previously been regarded as cysticercosis free, with only imported
cases, underlines the need for studies looking at porcine
cysticercosis and human taeniasis in areas where these cases
originated, to determine whether the full life-cycle is ongoing in
Argentina. - Mod.EP]
