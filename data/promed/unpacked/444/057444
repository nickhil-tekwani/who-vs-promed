The Nevada Department of Agriculture Animal Disease Laboratory has confirmed 3 cases of rabies in bats -- one in Washoe County and 2 in Clark County, according to a release from the NDA.

Bats are common throughout Nevada, with their activity increasing between May and October. While other species of wildlife can carry rabies, bats are the most common source of human and domestic animal transmission, making it important to keep pets vaccinated and ensure no contact is made with wildlife.

"It's important to ensure individuals and domestic animals do not come in contact with bats," Laura Morrow, NDA Animal Disease Lab supervisor, said in the release. "If you or your animals have had contact with any bats, contact your local healthcare or veterinary provider immediately."

Any bats, dead or alive, that may have been in contact with people or domestic animals should be reported immediately. It is important that individuals contact the NDA Animal Disease Lab or their local animal control agency before attempting to pick up a bat. If an individual is asked to collect the bat for testing, they should carefully follow all instructions provided by the agency including using heavy gloves to avoid potential bites.

The Animal Disease Laboratory confirms between 10 and 20 cases of bat rabies each year. To date in 2021, the Animal Disease Lab has tested 25 bats, and 3 were positive for rabies.

Despite its ability to infect all mammals, rabies virus persists in numerous species-specific cycles that rarely sustain transmission in alternative species. Rabies viruses recovered from bats were shown to be distinct from rabies viruses recovered from terrestrial mammals, suggesting that these viruses evolved within their bat hosts. Genetic evidence suggests that rabies is an old disease for bats in the New World. Bats from most of the bat species in North America, when sampled in sufficient numbers, have been found to be infected with rabies virus.

Bat rabies viruses are genetically diverse, exhibiting mutations characteristic to each host bat species. It should be taken into account, however, that bat rabies can be transmitted to humans and their domestic animals, being infections almost always fatal unless treated. Also, a dog, cat, or ferret infected with a bat rabid virus can infect a human, so keep your pet vaccination against rabies updated. - Mod.PMB
