The Minnesota Board of Animal Health said 8 more flocks have been confirmed with avian influenza.

Renville and Nicollet counties reported their 1st outbreaks. The Nicollet outbreak affected 1.1 million chickens. That is the largest farm so far with avian flu.

Kandiyohi reported 3 more bringing its number to a state-leading 29. Pipestone and Swift counties also reported outbreaks.

In all, 80 farms in 21 counties have reported avian influenza. It has affected 5.2 million birds.

Birds on 71 of the 80 farms have been euthanized. Composting is in progress on 68 of the farms.

Poultry is safe to eat, the Minnesota Department of Agriculture said. No human infections of this strain of the H5N2 virus have been reported, the Minnesota Department of Health said.

Minnesota's poultry death toll went beyond 5 million birds [Mon 4 May 2015] when state officials announced 80 farms in 21 counties have been hit by the H5N2 avian influenza.

The number of bird deaths, mostly turkeys, topped 5.3 million, with some flocks not yet counted. The figure includes those who have died from the flu and those that are being euthanized to prevent spread of the virus.

Monday's report showed Renville and Nicollet counties reported their 1st flu deaths, with 1.1 million chickens in one Nicollet flock.

It also showed Kandiyohi County continued to have by far the most flocks affected, 29, more than twice the number of flocks infected in Stearns County.

All affected farms are under quarantine. Birds on 71 farms have been euthanized.

Gov. Mark Dayton told reporters [Mon 4 May 2015] that he wants the state to provide low-interest loans to Minnesota farmers whose flocks became infected with avian influenza. He suggests loans of up to USD 100 000, while others want USD 200 000.

"I think it is something we should do and I strongly support it," Dayton said. Dayton already has signed the 1st step in the state's flu-fighting funding into law. On [Fri 1 May 2015], he signed a bill giving nearly USD 900 000 to state agencies to help pay for their flu-related expenses this year.

The state Executive Council has established a 30-day state of emergency over the turkey and chicken flu outbreak, allowing a variety of types of state government help.

Rural Republican legislators plan to provide free turkey burgers on the Capitol lawn [Tue 5 May 2015] morning. Chips and lemonade will complete the menu, giving Capitol area workers a chance to support the state's turkey industry, which produces 46 million birds a year.

Health officials say that poultry and eggs are safe to eat and there is no threat to public health.

The state has about 450 turkey farmers.

An 8th case of bird flu virus has been detected in Wisconsin. The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection said [Sun 3 May 2015] the latest case is in a commercial turkey flock in Barron County.

About 16 000 breeding turkeys and nearly 42 000 hatching eggs are affected.

It is the 4th reported case in Barron County. The property was immediately quarantined. The remaining birds will be euthanized and will not enter the flood supply.

Bird flu was first detected in Wisconsin at a commercial chicken flock in Jefferson County on 13 Apr 2015.

The number of affected birds has risen to more than 1.5 million in Wisconsin.

A ban on poultry movement to shows, exhibitions and swap meets in Barron, Chippewa, Jefferson, and Juneau counties remains in effect through the end of May [2015]

It seems almost surreal how fast this disease seems to be moving. One has to wonder what is the mechanism of spread? While some would say it is airborne (as are many viruses), it is so widespread that to say it is airborne may be an easy way out. How is it spreading? By trucks? By people? There is likely to be more than one method for this disease to be spreading so far and so fast. - Mod.TG]
