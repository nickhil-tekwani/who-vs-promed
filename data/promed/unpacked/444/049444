China: avian influenza situation - WHO update
---------------------------------------------
As of 19 Jan 2006, the Ministry of Health in China has confirmed an
additional case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The
case occurred in a 35 year old woman, from the south-central province of
Sichuan, who had been employed as a poultry culler. She developed symptoms
on 3 Jan 2006, was hospitalized on 10 Jan 2006 with symptoms of fever and
pneumonia, and died on 11 Jan.
Further investigation is under way to determine whether the woman may have
acquired her infection during culling operations or as a result of direct
exposure to infected birds in her village. She lived in a compound where 8
families were housed in close quarters. Members of these families and other
close contacts have been placed under medical observation. No signs of
influenza-like illness have been reported to date.
The newly confirmed case is the 9th in China. Of these cases, 6 have been
fatal. The cases have occurred in 7 provinces and regions: Anhui, Guangxi,
Liaoning, Jiangxi, Fujian, Hunan, and Sichuan.
