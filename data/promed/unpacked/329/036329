A man in his 50s died of scrub typhus on Monday [29 Aug 2022] at a private hospital in the city [Nagpur]. Though the deceased belonged to Nagpur rural area Kalmeshwar, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) malaria and filaria department has sounded an alert amid a resurgence of the vector-borne disease after 3 years in the city.

The deceased was admitted a week after the onset of symptoms as the disease remained undiagnosed, doctors said. "He then had pneumonia while his kidney and liver got affected. He died one-and-a-half days later due to multiorgan failure," they said.

In 2018, 4 scrub typhus patients died, followed by 2 in 2019. After that only a few cases were reported in the district. The zoonotic disease cases have also surfaced in a couple of other districts in Nagpur division, but have not yet officially been reported to health authorities.

In August [2022], NMC recorded 6 scrub typhus cases from different parts of the city. Government and private hospitals in the city have several patients with the disease admitted. This year's scrub typhus tally has increased to 13. 2 cases have also been reported in Nagpur rural.

NMC's malaria and filaria department has written to schools to ensure the removal of weeds from their premises. It has also asked the garden department to carry out a similar exercise in parks across the city.

NMC malaria and filaria officer Dr Jasmine Mulani said early diagnosis is key to early recovery in scrub typhus. "If reporting is late, then the patient goes into complications in the 2nd week. We have started dusting powder and spraying over excessive shrubs. But most important is that people take precautions," she said.

Dr Mulani added that people must avoid walking barefoot on grass and remove unnecessary vegetation from their surrounding area. "Pet owners must ensure their pets are kept clean. The disease is spread from the bite of the chigger mite, which thrives on the fur of animals," he said.
