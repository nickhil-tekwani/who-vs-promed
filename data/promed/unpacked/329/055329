Managua, Nicaragua - An outbreak of leptospirosis killed 1 person and
affected another 34 in the Nicaraguan Department of Rio San Juan (south),
on the border zone with Costa Rica, where the Ministry of Health [MOH -
MINSA declared an epidemiologic alert, an official of this organization
[an MOH official.
The cases were detected last week and MINSA [the MOH sent specialized
medical teams to control the disease mortality produced by the bacteria
_Leptospira_ encountered in rat urine, informed Juan Jose Amador, director
of Hygiene and Epidemiology.
The outbreak is taking place in the municipality of Morrito, apparently the
origin of the 1 fatal case and the 34 persons who presented symptoms, of
whom 4 were confirmed as carriers of the disease, specified the official
[MOH.
"This is the principal outbreak of this disease in the country", assured
Amador, who explained the disease arose in a house in a zone infested with
rats, of which the workers killed with garrotes "some 3000 [rats daily".
The bacteria _Leptospira_ species penetrates the organism through wounds
or from contaminated foods and provokes pains in the head, bones and
abdominal muscles but when it ruins organs such as the liver, kidneys and
lungs it produces death.
As preventive measures in Rio San Juan, where the rats are proliferating,
the MOH initiated an extermination campaign in order to avoid spreading the
disease to other communities.
