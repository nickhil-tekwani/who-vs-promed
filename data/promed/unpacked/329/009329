Cocoa farmers in the east of world No. 1 producer Ivory Coast [Cote
d'Ivoire] still hope the forthcoming crop will be at least as big as this
year's [2007-2008], but fear disease could lower bean quality. The new
cocoa season begins on 1 Oct [2008] and even if tonnages are good, quality
will be low, farmers said.

"We will have problems with quality this year [2008-2009] because there's a
lot of disease around at the moment, which spoils the beans," said Charles
Ehueni, owner of a 10-hectare (24.7 acres) cocoa plantation near Aboisso,
in the south east of the country.

The main threat is black pod disease, which thrives in wet conditions.
"After the rains, black pod disease started to get at the pods," said
farmer Ano Kablan, who works near the border with Ghana, the world's 2nd
biggest cocoa producer. "At the start it was just a few pods which started
to get the disease, but right now we are seeing more pods affected," he said.

Cold weather in mid-August [2008] raised fears the disease would affect
many plants. "Black pod disease has started to become widespread," said the
commercial director of a major exporting firm in Abidjan.

Some farmers in the south west of the leading cocoa producer [Cote
d'Ivoire] said they were seeing increased incidence of black pod disease.
Black pod is caused by a fungus that thrives in wet conditions and tends
not to like sunlight.

"The rains are light and good for the cocoa trees. There are lots of pods
on the trees, but the black pod is reducing their number," said Innocent
Zamble, who farms in the Meagui area. "We are spraying the plantations to
halt the disease -- we could do with more sunshine at the moment," he said.

But at San Pedro port, 85 km (53 miles) to the south, exporters said rains
had slowed to a halt in recent weeks. That would reduce the spread of black
pod, but could also slow the development of young pods, causing the coming
main crop to drop off after the initial flurry of harvesting activity in
September, October, and November. However, rains kept up in other key
producing regions further north.

[Black pod (also called _Phytophthora_ pod rot) is the primary fungal
disease affecting cocoa worldwide since the 1920s. Pathogens associated
with this disease are: _Phytophthora palmivora_ found worldwide; _P.
megakarya_ found in several West African countries; a species closely
resembling, but possibly different from, _P. capsici_ found in parts of the
Americas; and _P. citrophthora_, a more virulent, but relatively rare
species identified in Brazil.

_P. palmivora_ is the most common pathogen and can cause yield losses as
high as 95 per cent in very humid climates, with every pod affected. It
attacks all parts of the plant at all stages of the growing cycle and is
estimated to kill up to 10 per cent of trees annually through stem cankers.
Pod symptoms start with a small spot, which progressively turns darker
brown and expands rapidly over the whole pod. Losses are most severe when
pods are infected during the 2 months prior to ripening.

Black pod is spread by insects, mechanical means, plant debris, water, and
wind. Multiple infections from several sources may occur in plantations
with epiphytotics developing from a series of foci. Furthermore, genetic
resistance is generally low in commercial cocoa cultivars. Consequently,
disease management is difficult and needs an integrated approach, including
cultural techniques, phytosanitary measures, and targeted fungicide use.

Problems with black pod have been reported last year (2007) in the eastern
areas of the country (ProMED-mail post no. 20070914.3043) but seem to be
much more widespread now.
