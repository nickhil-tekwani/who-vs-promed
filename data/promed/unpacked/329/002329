[Since the start of the above event, [Wed 20 Jun 2018], the disease has been reported from 8 of Algeria's northern provinces, as can be seen in the OIE interactive map, updated [Thu 19 Jul 2018], at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=27085.

The affected provinces (from east to west) are: Oum El Bouaghi, Setif, Bejaia, Tizi Ouzou, Bouira, Blida, Medea, chlef.

OIE's outbreak summary, as of 19 Jul 2018:
Total outbreaks = 13 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 170 / 146 / 1 / 45 / 111

So far, the disease has been reported only from bovines; modified stamping out and vaccination in response to the outbreak are being applied. Information on the disease situation in other susceptible species, such as sheep and goats, is yet to become available and genotyping is yet to be performed.

Algeria's neighboring Maghreb countries, Tunisia on the east and Morocco on the west, are expected to undertake the required measures to prevent and, in case infected, control the disease. The border of Tunisia is about 100 km [62.13 mi approx.] distant from the closest infected Algerian province, Oum El Bouaghi. The border of Morocco is about 300 km [186.41 mi approx.] distant from the closest infected Algerian province on the west, Chlef. - Mod.AS
