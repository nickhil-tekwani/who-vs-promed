Assam has topped the list at the national level, but for a wrong reason -- both in the number of Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases and the toll it has taken. In 2018, till [26 Oct 2018], the vector-borne disease has claimed as many as 94 lives in the state.

What has led to such a precarious situation in the state? Vaccination is the only cure [prevention] for JE. However, the ground reality in the state remains that there has been no adult vaccination for JE in as many as 8 of its districts. The districts are Baksa, Chirang, Dhubri, Goalpara, Hailakandi, Karimganj, Dima Hasao, and Karbi Anglong. The situation is no better either in 9 other districts which registered below 70 percent JE vaccination. The vaccination drive has so far covered 63 percent in Tinsukia, 68 percent in Sivasagar, 66 percent in Kamrup, 46 percent in Nagaon, 65 percent in Barpeta, 53 percent Udalguri, 48 percent in Nalbari, 50 percent in Bongaigaon, and 48 percent in Morigaon districts.

Adult vaccination for JE has been being carried out in the state since 2012-13. However, according to sources in the National Vector-borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), Assam, the state can never attain 100 per cent JE vaccination in any of its districts.

The sources have further said that for the past 2 years, no central expert/observer has visited the state to take stock of the situation of vector-borne diseases here so far. According to the sources, JE has been detected among a few people who have been given vaccination.

In 2018, till [26 Oct 2018] as many as 488 cases have been detected in the state, and 94 of the patients have lost their lives. The highest toll by JE in the state is in Dibrugarh and Sonitpur districts -- registering 15 deaths each. Next to them is Kamrup with a death toll of 10.

NVBDCP, Assam is going to send proposals to the centre for vaccination drive in the 9 districts with below 70 percent vaccination.

[This is the busy Japanese encephalitis virus transmission season in northeastern India, including Assam state. The report above uses the term "Japanese encephalitis" without mentioning "acute encephalitis syndrome" that has been used in previous reports from Assam. Where laboratory confirmation of exclusion is reported, usually these encephalitis cases are attributed to Japanese encephalitis (JE) as a minority of cases, with acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) of unspecified etiology for the majority. This is the season for JE virus, but AES also occurs at this time. As noted in many earlier posts, the determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. Fortunately, vaccination for JE is being carried out in the affected areas in the district, which will prevent cases of encephalitis due to infection with that virus. The type of vaccine used is not mentioned. If it is an inactivated vaccine the duration of immunity may not be long-lasting. Attenuated live vaccine would provide longer immunity. - Mod.TY
