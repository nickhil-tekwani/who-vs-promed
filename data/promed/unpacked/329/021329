In response to the comment in the posting on EEE in Panama (Darien) [Eastern equine encephalitis - Panama (02) (DA) equine, confirmed, corr. archive number: 20150830.3611348] that an eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] vaccine is not available, I would like to bring to the attention of subscribers that there is an investigational new drug (IND) vaccine trial that has been ongoing at USAMRIID (USA) since February 2008 and is estimated to be completed by December 2016. See ClinicalTrials.gov https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00584805.

The vaccine is dried, inactivated virus, labeled TSI-GSD 104. It is currently in Phase 2 trial, being evaluated for safety and immunogenicity in healthy adults who are at risk of exposure to EEEV. Such individuals are eligible if they are between 18-65 years old, among other requirements, and must be actively enrolled in the Special Immunization Program. See the URL above for the full document on the Safety and Immunogenicity Study of Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) Vaccine - Full Text View.

Copies of "Protecting the Frontline in Biodefense Research: The Special Immunizations Program" are available from the National Academies Press, 500 Fifth Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20001; (800) 624-6242; http://www.nap.edu.

Pre-marketing (pre-licensure) vaccine clinical trials are typically done in 3 phases, as is the case for any drug or biologic. Initial human studies, referred to as Phase 1, are safety and immunogenicity studies performed in a small number of closely monitored subjects. Phase 2 studies are dose-ranging studies and may enroll hundreds of subjects. Finally, Phase 3 trials typically enroll thousands of individuals and provide the critical documentation of effectiveness and important additional safety data required for licensing. At any stage of the clinical or animal studies, if data raise significant concerns about either safety or effectiveness, FDA may request additional information or studies, or may halt ongoing clinical studies. For more information, see http://www.fda.gov/biologicsbloodvaccines/developmentapprovalprocess/biologicslicenseapplicationsblaprocess/ucm133096.htm.

The U.S. Army's Special Immunizations Program is an important component of an overall biosafety program for laboratory workers at risk of exposure to hazardous pathogens. The program provides immunizations to scientists, laboratory technicians and other support staff who work with certain hazardous pathogens and toxins. Although 1st established to serve military personnel, the program was expanded through a cost-sharing agreement in 2004 to include other government and civilian workers. ...more

Currently, the Special Immunizations Program includes investigational vaccines against botulism, equine encephalitis diseases (eastern, western, and Venezuelan), Rift Valley fever, Q fever, and tularemia. The program also provides Food and Drug Administration-licensed vaccines for anthrax, hepatitis B, Japanese encephalitis, rabies, smallpox, and yellow fever (excerpted from Special Immunization Program Report).

This EEEV IND vaccine is very expensive for the laboratory, making decisions as to recipients difficult. It is unlikely to ever be offered by a pharmaceutical company because of the low number of cases of EEE, thereby making profit unlikely. Currently, the cost per individual to remain in the SIP and be vaccinated is approximately USD 16 000 annually plus travel to the site. The equine vaccine, on the other hand, has been offered for many years as an inexpensive effective inactivated vaccine that is often available in combination with western equine encephalitis vaccine and, at times, tetanus vaccine (Colorado Serum Company).
