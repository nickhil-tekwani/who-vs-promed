Cyanide levels more than 350 times the acceptable limit have been found in waters close to the site of recent deadly explosions in the Chinese port city of Tianjin, officials said Thursday [20 Aug 2015].

The city's drinking water, however, remained safe, Deng Xiaowen, director of Tianjin's environmental monitoring center, told a media briefing aimed at easing public concerns.

"At present, all cyanide-contaminated waste waters are kept within the blast site." he said. The water will not be drained until it is cleaned up, officials said.

Outside the alert area, 6 of 16 testing sites also recorded cyanide levels, all of which were within reasonable limits, Deng added. The public, however, remained concerned as pictures of dead fish have circulated on social media. In response, Deng said his center has launched an investigation and will make public its findings as soon as authorities determine what caused the fish to die.

The mayor of Tianjin said his administration has enacted a plan to relocate chemical plants away from the Binhai New Area, where a warehouse at the center of the devastation was located, into the Nangang Industrial Zone, south of the Tianjin Port.

"This designated chemicals district will be an equivalent to the design of Singapore's Jurong Island. The deployment of a public safety island will also be facilitated -- a plan we've already activated," the mayor, Huang Xingguo, told another media briefing.

The State Council also has conducted an overhaul into the nation's chemicals industry, pledging to crack down on businesses which have violated laws and regulations, and on those which should be held responsible for the blasts, according to Huang.

The mayor's proposed special zone, nevertheless, isn't something new in China as there have been similar establishments in Shanghai and Nanjing, according to Liu Yuhang, secretary general of the hazardous chemical logistics branch under the China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing.

Such a model in Tianjin should bring clustering advantages to manufacturers including logistics operators as they can keep the cost of their investments down while maximizing operational efficiency.

In terms of safety, however, this model is not absolutely risk-free, Liu said.

"After such huge quantities of chemical products are put together in one special zone, we wonder if a bigger-than-expected chain reaction will be triggered should a small scale accident occur," Liu said, adding, "So, I think more discussion between the [Tianjin] government and the private sector is needed."

To ease safety concerns, Liu is urging authorities to pay attention to the problem of weak enforcement at the local government level since tight regulations promoted by the central government have been in place to regulate the sector.

The logistics sector handling hazardous chemicals has come under greater scrutiny since the blasts occurred. According to the federation, as of last year [2014], China had 12 000 licensed logistics operators working near chemical producers along the southeastern coast. On average, they transport 200 million tons of dangerous chemicals across the country, posing a severe safety concern, Liu said.

The experience of Singapore's Jurong Island, thus, shows that the professional management of such dangerous chemicals is key to preventing accidents as devastating as the one that occurred at Tianjin Port, says Jack Hsieh, executive manager of a petrochemical industry association.

"Jurong Island has tight security; similar to that of a military base; you have to go through checkpoints to enter the island," said Hsieh.

In terms of emergency response, the island's fire stations are equipped with capable and sufficient personnel while drills are conducted periodically to ensure firefighting practices and standards are up-to-date, he added.

[To understand how the cyanide got into the water, it may be helpful to look back at the explosion and the warehouse involved, as well as its likely contents.

Authorities had earlier said that the warehouse contained calcium carbide, potassium nitrate and ammonium nitrate.

Calcium carbide is used in the production of PVC plastic, while the other 2 chemicals are used in producing fertilizers and dynamite. Calcium carbide can be harmful if touched or breathed, and doctors recommend immediately washing affected areas. Calcium carbide, when mixed with water, produces acetylene gas, which is flammable.

A chemical safety expert says that the acetylene explosion could have detonated the ammonium nitrate. Judging from the magnitude of the blasts, the explosions were caused by chemicals such as potassium nitrate igniting.

There were unconfirmed reports that the warehouse contained 700 tonnes of sodium cyanide, stored in wooden boxes or iron barrels. The chemical is used in the mining industry, among other uses. Police had confirmed the presence of an unspecified quantity of it near the site.

The chemical toluene diisocyanate, which can penetrate the skin and cause poisoning, was also being stored at the plant, according to a Chinese doctor who warned people to wear gas masks and cover their bodies.

Therefore, armed with this information, there may be more than cyanide in the water. The article is quick to point out that the cyanide in the water may be in other surface water, not the drinking water supply. The concern there is where is the drinking water? Is it in towers or is it drawn from ground water? It is entirely possible that whatever cyanide is in the surface water may find its way eventually to the ground water, which maybe a source of drinking water. Without knowing where the water mentioned in the article was tested (a puddle on the pavement vs. surface water, like a pond), or what the composition of the soil is (sandy, rocky, loam, clay, etc.), calculation of how long the cyanide levels may be there in the water becomes difficult with limited information.

Some people who drink water containing cyanide well in excess of the maximum contaminant level (MCL) for many years could experience nerve damage or thyroid problems.

This health effects language is not intended to catalog all possible health effects for cyanide. Rather, it is intended to inform consumers of some of the possible health effects associated with cyanide in drinking water.

These non-enforceable health goals, based solely on possible health risks and exposure over a lifetime with an adequate margin of safety, are called maximum contaminant level goals (MCLG). Contaminants are any physical, chemical, biological or radiological substances or matter in water.

The MCLG for cyanide is 0.2 mg/L or 200 ppb. According the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the USA, a recommended level of protection based on the best available science to prevent potential health problems -- an enforceable regulation for cyanide, called a maximum contaminant level (MCL), is set at 0.2 mg/L or 200 ppb. MCLs are set as close to the health goals as possible, considering cost, benefits and the ability of public water systems to detect and remove contaminants using suitable treatment technologies. In this case, the MCL equals the MCLG, because analytical methods or treatment technology do not pose any limitation.

I wish to acknowledge the research by ProMED-mail Corr.SB for her assistance in finding the chemicals that were supposedly stored in the warehouse as well as other information.
