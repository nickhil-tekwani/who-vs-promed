Chronic wasting disease, or CWD, has been found in a Mississippi animal for the 1st time, officials said. A 4.5-year-old white-tailed deer in Issaquena county was found [25 Jan 2018] has tested positive for the disease, officials said.

The buck died of natural causes and was reported to the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks (MDWFP).

MDWFP immediately implemented the CWD Response Plan under the auspices of the Commission on Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks.

Effectively immediately, supplemental feeding is banned in Claiborne, Hinds, Issaquena, Sharkey, Warren, and Yazoo counties, the commission said.

According to the Chronic Wasting Disease Alliance, CWD affects only cervids (hoofed animals in the cervidae family such as deer, elk, and moose).

CWD affects the body's nervous system. Once in the host's body, prions transform normal cellular protein into an abnormal shape that accumulates until the cell ceases to function.

Infected animals begin to lose weight, lose their appetite, and develop an insatiable thirst. They tend to stay away from herds, walk in patterns, carry their head low, salivate, and grind their teeth.

The disease was first documented among captive mule deer in Colorado in 1967, and has been confirmed in 24 [US] states, 3 [see below] Canadian provinces, and 2 foreign countries [Norway and South Korea].

It has been found in the free-ranging herds in 22 states and among captive cervids in 16 states, officials said.

[The location of this positive animal in Mississippi is on the western border, just about at the Arkansas and Louisiana line. Louisiana is likely on alert and has increased surveillance. Arkansas also has CWD, but in its northwestern area. In other words, it is not likely that a positive Arkansas animal walked across the state and the border into Mississippi. It is good to know they already had a plan in place and only had to put it into action. - Mod.TA

According to the news report above, CWD has been confirmed in 3 Canadian provinces. The disease is known to occur in 2 provinces in Canada (Alberta, Saskatchewan), with an historic report of occurrence in a situation involving captive deer in a 3rd province (Ontario). CWD is well established and expanding its distribution in Alberta and Saskatchewan. There is also an historic report of CWD in a small number of deer in the Toronto Zoo (source identified as a captive mule deer imported from Colorado); however, following immediate and rigorous disease control efforts, there is no evidence that the disease escaped the zoo."
