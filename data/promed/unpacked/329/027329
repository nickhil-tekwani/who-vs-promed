Bubonic and pneumonic plague - Uganda, 2006
-------------------------------------------
Plague is a life-threatening fleaborne disease caused by the
bacterium _Yersinia pestis_. The most common clinical form is bubonic
plague, which is characterized by high fever and regional
lymphadenitis. Without treatment, infection can spread from lymph
nodes [through the bloodstream - Mod.LL] to the lungs, resulting in
pneumonic plague and the potential for person-to-person transmission
through respiratory droplets (1,2).

In November 2006, the Uganda Ministry of Health received reports of
an increase in bubonic plague cases and a possible outbreak of
pneumonic plague among residents in the Arua and Nebbi districts. In
response, the Uganda Ministry of Health and CDC conducted a joint
investigation in the 2 districts during 28 Nov 2006-30 Dec 2006. The
results of this investigation underscore the need to 1) continue
efforts to educate residents of rural Uganda regarding the source,
signs, and symptoms of plague and the life-saving importance of
seeking treatment; 2) strengthen plague surveillance and diagnostic
capabilities; and 3) improve emergency response and vector-control
capacity, especially in remote regions of the country.

In rural Uganda, where laboratory capacity is limited, clinicians
generally rely on clinical criteria for the diagnosis of plague.
These criteria, as established by the Uganda Ministry of Health, are
as follows: sudden onset of fever, chills, malaise, headache, or
prostration accompanied by either painful regional lymphadenitis
(bubonic plague) or cough with hemoptysis (pneumonic plague). For
this investigation, a plague case was defined as clinically diagnosed
plague with onset during 1 Jul 2006-30 Dec 2006, in a resident of
Arua or Nebbi districts. Beginning 28 Nov 2006, cases were
ascertained through retrospective review of patient logs in 8 clinics
and 2 hospitals that historically have accounted for 85 percent of
reported plague cases in the region (Uganda Virus Research Institute,
unpublished data, 1999-2005).

Information was collected on patient age, sex, village of residence,
clinical presentation, and outcome. In addition, clinicians at these
facilities and all other health clinics in Arua and Nebbi districts
were asked to report immediately by cellular telephone or messenger
any new cases identified. When possible, diagnostic samples (that is,
serum and bubo aspirates) were collected from patients with acute or
recent illness diagnosed as plague. Laboratory-confirmed plague was
defined as isolation of _Y. pestis_ or a 4-fold change in antibody
titer to F1 antigen between paired acute and convalescent serum
samples with a least one sample having a titer equal to or grater
than 1:16.

A total of 127 plague cases with onset dates during 19 Jul 2006-30
Dec 2006 (Figure 1 [for figures and tables, see original URL -
Mod.LL]), were identified in Arua and Nebbi districts in northwestern
Uganda (Figure 2). Among the 102 patients with documented symptoms,
90 (88 percent) had bubonic plague, and 12 (12 percent) had pneumonic
plague. 2 or more plague cases were reported from 9 different
villages, including 4 villages that reported 10 or more cases (Nave,
18; Kestro, 18; Andosi, 17; and Yiapi, 10). The median patient age
was 14 years (range: 2 weeks-65 years); 65 patients (51 percent) were
female (Table).

Of 11 pneumonic plague deaths, 6 (55 percent) occurred in a single
village, in which 4 members of a single family died. Interviews with
village residents indicated that the index case in that family was in
a boy aged 10 years who developed fever and a cervical bubo, followed
by hemoptysis; he died on 3 Nov 2006. Within 7 days, the child's
mother, grandmother, and aunt, all of whom had cared for the child,
also developed hemoptysis and died. Initially, ill village residents
did not seek health care because they believed the illness was of
supernatural origin stemming from a local feud. However, when 2
additional village members not involved in the feud died of similar
symptoms on 8 Nov 2006, ill villagers began seeking care at the
health clinic, where they were treated with appropriate antibiotics
and recovered.

Bubo aspirates were obtained from 11 (12 percent) of 90 patients with
bubonic manifestations. None of the cases met the criteria for
laboratory confirmation. _Y. pestis_ was not recovered from any of
the 11 aspirates; however, 8 of the 11 patients had been treated with
antibiotics before sample collection. Paired acute and convalescent
blood samples were obtained from 7 (6 percent) of the 127 patients
and convalescent blood samples alone from another 31 (24 percent). No
paired serum samples had a 4-fold change in antibody titer. However,
convalescent sera from 5 (13 percent) of the 38 total patients with
convalescent samples had single titers that ranged from 1:16 to 1:256
(median: 1:64), which is suggestive of recent or previous _Y. pestis_
infection. Samples were not available from any of the 12 patients who
received a diagnosis of pneumonic plague; 11 of these patients died
before the investigation began.

To evaluate access to care, patient behaviors, and potential plague
exposures, structured interviews were conducted during 1-16 Dec 2006
with a convenience sample of 39 plague patients in 6 Arua and Nebbi
villages. Dates of illness onset for interviewed patients were from
13 Oct 2006 to 14 Dec 2006. 27 patients (69 percent) reported that
they walked to the local health clinic for treatment of plague
symptoms, and 12 (31 percent) rode a bicycle. 15 patients (38
percent) said travel to the nearest health clinic took more than 2
hours, and 24 patients (62 percent) said travel took 2 hours or less.
17 (44 percent) of the interviewed patients reported taking
medications, including acetaminophen, chloroquine, or traditional
herbs, obtained in the village before visiting the clinic. 23
patients (59 percent) reported seeing dead rats in their homes during
the 2 weeks preceding their illness; some villagers reported recently
finding and burying dead rats near their homes.

While visiting villages, investigators in the 2 districts recovered 8
dead rats (_Rattus rattus_), of which 4 tested positive for _Y.
pestis_ by direct fluorescent antibody staining and 2 tested positive
by culture isolation. Live _R. rattus_ species trapped in 2 affected
villages were found to have an average of 2 fleas per rat; recovery
of more than 1 flea per rat has been associated with increased risk
for plague transmission (3). On 8 Dec 2006, vector-control teams
comprised of local villagers began applying dichlorvos, a residual
insecticide, to households in affected villages in an effort to
interrupt plague transmission. By 14 Dec 2006, the teams had treated
935 houses in 10 Arua District villages that had reported 2 or more
plague cases since 1 Sep 2006. The death of the vector-control team
leader from causes unrelated to plague prevented expansion of the
spraying operation to affected villages in Nebbi District.

Editorial note
--------------
African countries accounted for nearly 90 percent of the 28 530
plague cases reported to the World Health Organization during the
most recent 10-year reporting period (1994-2003) (4). In Uganda,
200-400 clinically diagnosed plague cases are reported annually, with
an estimated case-fatality rate of 30 percent (4). Although human
cases typically occur sporadically or in small clusters, the
potential for pneumonic outbreaks with spread to other areas is a
great concern (5,6). Approximately 6 weeks after this investigation,
an outbreak of pneumonic plague with 7 deaths was reported from
Masindi District, a neighboring but ecologically distinct region
where plague is not endemic. The index patient was an adolescent girl
aged 15 years who had become ill while visiting relatives in a
plague-affected area of Nebbi District.

The investigation described in this report highlights some of the
challenges associated with identifying and controlling plague in
rural Africa. Because of limited laboratory capacity, clinicians
usually rely on clinical criteria alone when diagnosing illnesses.
Consequently, patients with other causes of acute lymphadenitis (such
as, staphylococcal) can be misdiagnosed as having plague, and
patients with plague can be misdiagnosed as having other illnesses.
When laboratory services are available, impassible roads and other
logistic barriers can prevent timely specimen collection. Patients
with less serious conditions might survive long enough to be tested;
however, patients with more severe _Y. pestis_ infection are likely
to die before specimens can be collected. Such differential testing
might have contributed to the low rate of seropositivity observed in
this investigation among those patients whose specimens were tested.
Greater regional laboratory capacity and point-of-care diagnostic
assays would help clinicians and health officials identify plague
cases more quickly, distinguish these cases from other causes of
similar illness, and facilitate more effective control of plague in
Africa.

Also highlighted by this investigation is the effect of local beliefs
on care-seeking behavior. Anthropologic studies have indicated that
tribes living in Arua District hold diverse beliefs about disease
causation and the role of the supernatural in human illness (7).
Investigators observed that villagers initially ascribed an outbreak
of pneumonic plague to feuding rather than to a disease that can be
treated with antibiotics. Because prompt antimicrobial treatment can
be life-saving for patients with plague, further studies are needed
to 1) define local beliefs as they relate to plague, 2) determine how
they influence care-seeking, and 3) identify effective messages that
will result in plague patients seeking care at their local health
center more quickly.

To enhance recognition, treatment, and control of plague in Uganda,
CDC has entered into a cooperative agreement with the Uganda Ministry
of Health and the Uganda Viral Research Institute. Studies are under
way to 1) evaluate rapid, point-of-care diagnostic assays for plague,
2) describe belief systems that influence health-care-seeking
behavior, 3) define the relative importance of various rodent and
fleas species in plague transmission, and 4) assess opportunities for
integrating flea control into existing vector-control programs (such
as, indoor residual spraying for malaria prevention). The overarching
goal of this multidisciplinary effort is to create effective
prevention programs and develop and exercise local contingency plans
for plague outbreak response.
