An outbreak of eastern equine encephalitis is expanding in Wisconsin.

State Veterinarian Robert Ehlenfeldt says 25 cases of the
mosquito-borne disease have been confirmed in Wisconsin since
mid-August 2011, mostly in the north-central part of the state.

Ehlenfeldt advises horse owners to call a veterinarian if their horses
show any signs of central nervous system disease. Those include loss
of appetite, dropping eyelids and lower lip, aimless wandering and
circling, and sometimes paralysis.

The disease has a mortality rate of 90 percent or higher. So far, the
disease has been detected in Price, Lincoln, Taylor, Clark, Marathon
and Dunn counties.

Ehlenfeldt expects more cases to be confirmed. He says warm weather
forecast next week might mean mosquitoes are more active.

In 2001, 69 cases of the disease were confirmed in Wisconsin.

[Although 69 cases in 2001 is a very high number for a disease, it is
easily preventable. There is a very effective vaccine for protection
against eastern equine encephalitis. It is usually given in
combination with West Nile virus and tetanus. While the immunity wanes
after about 6 months, it is not difficult or expensive to revaccinate.
Why horse owners can be so passionate about their animals and refuse
to vaccinate against this disease is beyond common sense.

While the disease may not often reach northern Wisconsin, it has been
found in Canada in some years, and believing that it won't be there is
irresponsible. Please get your horses vaccinated. - Mod.TG
