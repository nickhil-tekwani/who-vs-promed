In August 2016, samples of 2 strawberry plants of pre-flowering stage showing bushy appearance, stunted growth and little leaves were collected from a commercial field south of Adelaide.

PCR tests revealed the phytoplasma nature of the pathogen. Further analysis by cloning and sequencing indicated that the plants were affected by strawberry lethal yellows [SLY] phytoplasma. In 2 surveys of the field, 5 out of approximately 55 000 plants were discovered with symptoms.

SLY was previously reported from Queensland [see ref. below], but this is its first report in South Australia. The infected plants may have arrived with runners imported from Queensland.

[Strawberry lethal yellows (SLY) is caused by a strain of _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma australiense (CPA; stolbur group, 16SrXII). It is closely related to, or identical with, phytoplasmas associated with strawberry green petal disease, yellow leaf disease of New Zealand flax (_Phormium tenax_), Australian grapevine yellows and papaya dieback. It is thought that CPA may have originated in New Zealand and then spread to Australia and possibly other countries in the region.

Symptoms of SLY may include inward rolling and purpling of older leaves which flatten to the ground; yellow margins, stunting and short stalks on young leaves which leads to clusters of small, yellow-fringed leaves in the centre of plants; stunting and death of plants.

CPA may be spread by leafhopper vectors (Cicadellidae), depending on the host, and with infected plant material, such as strawberry runners. SLY symptom development may take up to 8 weeks after infection, so freedom of symptoms cannot be taken as proof of freedom from CPA. Similarly in the report above, since the seemingly low SLY incidence is only based on symptoms, the actual level of infection of the crop may be higher. Asymptomatic infections are also known to occur for some phytoplasmas.

Disease management may include vector control, removal of potential reservoir hosts and culling of symptomatic plants in propagation nurseries, but certification of planting material by molecular methods, as reported above, is essential for pathogen exclusion.

Stolbur phytoplasmas, alone or in coinfections, have been reported to affect a range of dicotyledoneous crops (including tomato, potato, capsicum, aubergine, grapevine, sugar beet), as well as a few monocot hosts such as maize and sugarcane (ProMED-mail posts 20070607.1844 and 20080303.0869).
