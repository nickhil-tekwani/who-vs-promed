The National Reference Laboratory for African swine fever (ASF) at the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI) has so far confirmed 13 cases of ASF in wild boar in Brandenburg. The 1st case on 10 Sep 2020 was detected in a carcass of a 2- to 3-year wild sow in the district of Spree-Neisse; the other 12 cases in wild boar were detected near the municipality of Neuzelle in the district of Oder-Spree and thus in the demarcated infected area designated by the Land Brandenburg. All of them were first tested positive in the responsible veterinary state laboratory in Berlin-Brandenburg, and sample material was then sent to the National Reference Laboratory at FLI for clarification.

In light of the experience gained in other countries affected by ASF, it can be assumed that the epidemic is at an early stage. In addition, one of the wild boar was found sick and shot in the Oder-Spree district. This also indicates that the disease situation is still ongoing. It is to be expected that further cases will be added in the course of the intensified search for fall game. The search for fall game will be used to precisely locate the infected area and to remove the carcasses as sources of infection for further feral pigs.

[Germany initiated its preventive measures against the introduction of ASF since it initially entered (eastern) Poland in 2014; the measures have been intensified following the 300-km (186 mi) leap of the virus from the Warsaw region westward toward the German border in late 2019. The German policy has been described in Germany's presentations to EU's PAFF committee in November 2019 and May 2020, available, respectively, at https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/reg-com_ahw_20191221_asf_deu.pdf (21-22 Nov 2019) and https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/reg-com_ahw_20200618_asf_deu.pdf (14 May 2020).

A map showing the locations of the confirmed ASF cases in the districts of Spree-Neisse and Oder-Spree in Brandenburg is available at the source URL (the cases around the municipality of Neuzelle in the Oder-Spree district partly overlap). - Mod.AS
