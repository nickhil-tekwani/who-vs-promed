Health leaders in North Carolina are urging people to look out for
mumps after a 21-year-old got the disease... possibly from the April
[2010] Rugby Tournament in Danville, Virginia. He contracted the
disease after interacting with members of an English rugby team.

One person from that team was diagnosed with mumps virus infection
and 4 others developed symptoms consistent with the disease. The team
is now back in England.

Mumps causes swelling of the cheeks and jaw and is spread by coughing
and sneezing. Symptoms may include low grade fever, headache, muscle
aches, tiredness, loss of appetite, and swelling of salivary glands.

[Mumps is usually a mild disease, but can occasionally cause serious
complications. The most common complication is inflammation of the
testicles (orchitis) in males who have reached puberty, occasionally
leading to fertility problems. Other rare complications include
inflammation of the brain and/or tissue covering the brain and spinal
cord (encephalitis/meningitis), inflammation of the ovaries
(oophoritis) and/or breasts (mastitis) in females who have reached
puberty, and deafness.

Although the majority of young adults the USA and the UK should be
protected by routine MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccination in
childhood, there is some evidence that immunity to mumps virus
infection tends to decline. Contact sports such as rugby football may
exacerbate the situation by increasing the risk of transmission of
infection. - Mod.CP]
