States infected by wind-borne soybean fungus rise to 9
Researchers at the National Plant Germplasm and Biotechnology Laboratory,
Beltsville, MD., said today that 1 of 2 soybean leaf samples collected near
Memphis, TN., has tested positive for _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_, the causal
fungus of soybean rust [SR].
SR, a disease spread primarily by wind-borne spores, has been confirmed in
9 states since it was first discovered in the United States on 10 Nov 2004
in Louisiana. Other states include Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia,
Mississippi, Missouri and South Carolina.

[The fact that SR has been reported from a wide geographic area in the
southeastern U.S. states this late in the crop year is a mixed blessing. It
would have been much worse if SR had infected soybean early in the crop
year. However, farmers can use the time from now to seeding to prepare for
the 2005 crop year, knowing that SR will likely cause yield losses. -Mod.DH]
