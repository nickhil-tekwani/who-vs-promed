South Africa reports 3rd Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever case of the year
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
In a follow-up on Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in South Africa this year [2022], the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) reported the 3rd confirmed human case in the country in 2022.

The latest case, a 36-year-old man from the Cape Winelands District fell ill on 8 Oct 2022 and was taken to a local hospital on 12 Oct 2022 with symptoms of fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, muscle pain, coughing and malaise.

Later symptoms included overt bleeding, namely purpura, ecchymosis, petechiae, melaena stool and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The patient also had liver failure.

The patient works in an abattoir in the Cape Winelands district, and given the occupational risk and clinical picture, he was clinically diagnosed with CCHF on 17 Oct 2022 and laboratory confirmed the next day.

The patient is currently recovering. The abattoir worker most likely became infected after coming into contact with infected animal blood and tissues during sheep slaughter.

The 3 confirmed cases this year [2022] were reported in Western Cape Province (n = 2) and Eastern Cape Province (n = 1).

[CCHF was first reported in South Africa in 1981 (1). CCHF is being reported with increasing frequency from South Africa. In 1985, an outbreak was reported from a Cape Town hospital due to nosocomial spread of virus (2). Nosocomial infections with CCHF have occurred in other countries, including Iraq, the former Soviet Union, and Pakistan (3,4). Contact with bloody secretions appeared to be the means of transmission in those outbreaks, although airborne transmission has been neither proven nor disproven (4).

CCHF is caused by a bunyavirus of the arbovirus group. Widespread occurrence of the antibodies in wild and domestic animals in South Africa has been documented (5). Transmission to humans is thought to be primarily via the _Hyalomma_ genus of tick or contact with the blood of infected animals (5).

CCHF, as well as other viral hemorrhagic fevers, such as Ebola virus disease, Marburg virus disease, and Lassa fever, have the potential to spread in a hospital setting. Patients are often hospitalized with a severe illness, but the nonspecific nature of their signs and symptoms may not suggest a viral hemorrhagic fever.

Even simple isolation procedures, such as barrier nursing on open wards, can effectively halt transmission of these viruses. Therefore, it is imperative that a diagnosis of a viral hemorrhagic fever be considered in any patient with an unknown febrile disease who either resides in or traveled to an endemic area within 3 weeks of the onset of symptoms. If other more common causes of the fever, such as malaria or sepsis, can be reasonably excluded, measures for isolation of the patient should be taken immediately. - Mod.UBA
