The village on the Chikkaballapur-Devanahalli border is in the clutches of chikungunya and the number of patients as well as the fear of death are only rising by the day.

Doctors and medical staff have been treating the citizens ceaselessly the last about 15 days, but have been unable to control the spread of the disease. More than a 100 people are being treated at the government and private hospitals near Venkatagiri Kote on a daily basis, but many are now taking help from the hospitals at Chikkaballapur, Devanahalli, and Bangalore since the situation has not improved.

"Virtually all of Venkatagiri Kote is suffering from chikungunya [virus infections]. Visit any house and you will find at least a couple of residents being treated for the disease," say the worried residents of the village.

In Gangabhavani (Ambedkar) Colony itself there are more than 100 residents, including children aged 2 or 3 years, infected. The colony mostly houses manual workers and is majorly deprived of basic facilities, especially hygiene. With the fear of the fever diffusing its tentacles to everyone in the area spreading fast, residents say, "If one member of the family gets ill, it takes barely a couple of days for the fever to spread to the others. Passing each day is a difficult job."

Speaking to Deccan Herald, a resident of Venkatagiri Kote said, "The reason for the speed at which the infection is spreading is still not known to the doctors. The most prevalent symptoms of those ill in the village are those that come with an attack of chikungunya [virus]. There is fever, body ache, and weakness. Yet, the medical authorities are not sure of the type of fever or why there has been such a widespread attack." He also expressed the fear prevalent among the residents of Venkatagiri Kote of the disability to attend work, due to the illness: "The temporary state of joblessness because of the fever attack has added to our worries."

He rued, however, the lack of concern among the elected representatives towards the condition of the village residents. "On learning that Venkatagiri Kote was under attack of the fever for about a fortnight, the district health officer and the Devanahalli legislator visited us. If they are unable to control the spread of the disease none of us will feel like remaining in the village," he said.

The patients spend INR 500 [USD 8.85] to INR 700 [USD 12.39] a day for treatment at the private hospitals and clinics. "The doctors at some clinics fleece us giving the spread of the disease as a reason," said the citizens.

The doctors and medical staff have been struggling to simultaneously treat the ill residents and prevent further cases of illness. They have remained at the village, working at the treatment centre through the day. "The fever cannot be specified as chikungunya or dengue. It is a viral fever and it spreads through _Aedes_ mosquitos," said Dr Yadupathi, medical officer at the primary health centre, Karahalli.

"The blood samples of the patients have already been sent to Bangalore Public Health Institute (PHI) and we are yet to receive the report. Only after we receive their take on the illness can we say for sure what kind of fever the residents of are suffering from," he added.

[Curiously, no mention is made of acute arthralgia, a common symptom of most chikungunya virus infections. Joint pain can be so severe that it is incapacitating, and may last for weeks or months. The results of laboratory tests would be of interest, to know if this outbreak is really due to chikungunya virus or to dengue virus infections, or to a mixed outbreak of both.

Chikungunya virus is endemic in India, and causes sporadic cases around the country. There is no commercially available vaccine available, so mosquito vector control is the only feasible preventive measure.
