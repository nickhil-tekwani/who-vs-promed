An outbreak of Viral Meningitis has been occuring in Rio since August
[1988], with
217 cases reported.
Most of them occurred in younger children (4-10 years old), without fatalities.
The Department of Epidemiology of the Municipal Health Secretariat sent 38
samples of CSF from patients who were admitted at IEISS-Sao Sebastiao
Institute of Infectology to the Virology Laboratory of FioCruz - Osvaldo
Cruz Foundation, to identify the virus. We are waiting the result.
