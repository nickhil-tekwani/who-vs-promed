Residents of Hozhai Village in Jiyang Count of Jinan Province called a reporter to say that they've lived in their village for decades but that a group of "uninvited guests" had appeared in their village.

Near a gully behind the village of Houzhai in Jiyang County, in the underbrush and beside mounds of dirt, there were more than a dozen animals similar to small dogs. Some had died already. According to nearby villagers, when the animals were 1st found, there were probably 100-200 of them. Surviving animals had made their way into cornfields, and those that were immobile or dead had already been buried.

Villagers said that these animals had already started eating the carcasses of their deceased mates. Seeing this cruel scene unfold, villagers felt unsettled and wondered whether those that had gone into fields and the village would be a danger to residents. They worried that if those 70 or 80 animals that had been buried had died of illness, would simply covering them up be adequate? The gutter where the carcasses were found is frequently used as an irrigation canal for the village. If these animals carried some kind of pathogen, the consequences could be unthinkable.

Later, the reporter took images for expert assessment. Assistant Professor Wang Yuzhi of Shandong University Life Sciences Institute said: "These animals are classified as a type of raccoon dog commonly known as 'haozi' or 'li.' They belong to [a type of] "haozi."

These mysterious visitors could easily be carrying a pathogen that could even be transmitted to humans or livestock. Since it couldn't quickly be confirmed whether they are carrying a pathogen, personnel from the Jiyang County Animal Husbandry Bureau immediately carried out safe disposal of these raccoon dogs.

[Although they resemble raccoons, raccoon dogs (_Nyctereutes procyonoides_) belong to the family Canidae (as do dogs, foxes, and wolves; raccoons are procyonids). For a picture of a raccoon dog, go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon_dog#/media/File:Tanuki01_960.jpg.

Wild carnivores are known to be susceptible to common pathogens of dogs and cats. Raccoon dogs have been reported with canine distemper, rabies and sarcoptic mange.
