The World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned that 2.5 billion
people are at risk from one of the world's fastest-emerging
infections, which has "grown dramatically in recent decades."
Officials at the WHO say Asia, home to 70 percent of the at-risk
population, has seen a rise in dengue mainly because of higher
temperatures due to climate change, rising populations, and greater
international travel. The organisation says "a rapid rise in urban
mosquito populations" is also bringing ever greater numbers of people
into contact with the virus.

According to data collected by the UN body, the highest number of
reported cases in Asia this year [2010] to August are in Indonesia
(80 065) followed by Thailand (57 948) and Sri Lanka (27 142). "The
disease has spread fast. Dengue is appearing in new areas," said
Yogesh Choudhri, an expert at the WHO on the Asia region, who said
the disease had crossed new international borders and spread within
countries. It was found in the Himalayan countries of Bhutan and
Nepal for the 1st time in 2004, and is endemic in most of Southeast
and South Asia as well as Indonesia and East Timor.

Dengue serotypes in Lao PDR
---------------------------
Dengue infections have been reported for a long time in Laos.
Outbreaks occurred annually mainly during and shortly after the rainy
season. Previous reports summarized the situation in Lao PDR and
provided some indication of the number of reported cases and
mortality rate associated to dengue. However, there is a paucity of
data concerning the serotypes circulating annually in Lao.

Suspected dengue cases (patients residing in Vientiane with fever
more than 38 deg C or 100.4 deg F for more than 24 hours, without any
apparent source of infection, complaining of occasional headache,
myalgia and arthralgia), who visited the Medical Centre of the French
Embassy in Vientiane, had a blood sample taken for virological
diagnosis and investigations. Pending the completion of building
construction of the Institut Pasteur of Laos in Vientiane, a
diagnostic network has been established with the French National
Reference Centre for Arboviruses, Institut Pasteur, Paris.

Samples collected from 10 Sep 2010 to 10 Oct 2010 were sent weekly
and anonymously to France via rapid courier service. Serological and
RT-PCR results were returned by e-mail within 4 days after samples
consignment. Of the 30 samples investigated, 17 were found positive
for dengue viremia by real time RT-PCR. Molecular typing evidenced a
co-circulation of at least 2 serotypes; i.e., Dengue 1 (10/17) and
Dengue 2 (5/17). The last positive sample is suspected to be Dengue
3. Virus isolations are underway for a full characterization of the
viral strains.

Dengue 1 seemed to be predominant this year [2010] in Vientiane, but
the high proportion of dengue 2 and the possible circulation of a 3rd
serotype may sustain dengue circulation in Lao this year [2010].
Indeed, climatic conditions with prolonged precipitation are
compatible with a persistence of high vector densities in Laos. To
our knowledge no data concerning dengue serotype(s) circulating in
others Lao PDR provinces have been reported in 2010. Surveillance of
dengue serotype is requisite for a better understanding of dengue
epidemiology in Lao PDR, as well as to reinforce the management of
dengue in the country.

In the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific (WHO/WPRO) report,
available at <http://www.wpro.who.int/health_topics/dengue/>, the
number of reported cases of dengue fever and dengue haemorrhagic
fever (DF/DHF) in Laos between 1 Jan 2010 and 16 Oct 2010 was 21 509
cases (45 deaths, case fatality rate 0.21 percent). Weekly number of
reported DF/DHF cases was declining after peaking in 8-14 Aug 2010;
7810 cases (provisional) were reported for the entire year in 2009.

of 2010 (through 9 Oct 2010) by comparing to the mean and mean plus 2

After affecting Sindh, the dengue virus has begun to rapidly spread
in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa [formerly the North-West Frontier Province],
while at least 27 people have died countrywide due to the epidemic, a
private TV channel reported on Thursday [28 Oct 2010]. According to
the [Pakistan] National Institute of Health (NIH), as many as 1170
people had been affected from the dengue virus in Punjab. About 93
more dengue affectees had been brought to various hospitals of Lahore
in the last 24 hours, raising the toll to 964 dengue patients in the
city. In Faisalabad, 8 people had been admitted in a separate ward of
the Allied Hospital, the channel reported. According to the Health
Department, the 1st round of the anti-dengue spray had been completed
in the rural and urban areas.

reported that the (Pakistan) National Institute of Health (NIH)
confirmed on Thursday (28 Oct 2010) that so far 23 deaths have been
reported, 4 fewer than the report above. The NIH said in total 3100
patients suffering from dengue fever have been receiving treatment
from public and private hospitals in different cities in Pakistan.

On 17 Oct 2010 the Pakistan NIH reported 1141 confirmed dengue cases
(see ProMED-mail archive no. 20101018.3777), and since then has
increased to 3100 in 12 days.

[4] Mexico (Tamaulipas)
Date: Wed 27 Oct 2010

The Ministry of Health in Tamaulipas has issued an alert to the
public about the presence of a new dengue virus [serotype] which, as
well as being immune to certain drugs, re-infects a person who has
already had the disease [caused by a different dengue virus
serotype]. This was announced by Fernando Garza Frausto who explained
that the municipalities of Reynosa and Rio Bravo have detected cases
of this type of dengue since patients present the same symptoms when
they reach the hospitals. [Anti-viral drugs are not effective against
dengue viruses, calling into question the statement above. - Mod.TY]

The director of Prevention and Health Protection added that "we have
3 cases in Reynosa, one in Rio Bravo, which are already controlled,
but we are on the alert for more cases in this jurisdiction where a
total of 98 cases have been recorded."

Frausto Garza explained that a few months ago Tamaulipas had
registered only classical dengue fever and DHF, but said that in
recent weeks the presence of this new virus had been detected which
can affect the same person a 2nd time.

"[Dengue virus serotype 1 already occurred in Tamaulipas and affected
persons are immune]. However, with the new virus, people are
susceptible and may become ill with dengue," he said.

The health official mentioned that the risk now is that the new type
has not affected the people from the state, which means that those
who have already suffered from dengue may be reinfected, so he urged
people to strengthen precautionary measures.

[Because dengue virus type 3 circulates in southern Mexico, health
authorities in the north eastern state of Tamaulipas are concerned
about its arrival there, affecting a population with no immunity to
that virus serotype. That population has only had recent experience
with dengue virus type 1 (see the 10 Oct 2010 edition of Milenio.com
<http://www.milenio.com/node/550022>, in Spanish).
