BLUETONGUE, SHEEP - ITALY (SARDINIA) (02)

ProMED-mail's posting "Bluetongue, sheep - Italy (Sardinia) 20030918.2361"
included correctable information derived from "Unione Sarda" of 17 Sep
2003, which said: "Bluetongue virus of serotype 2 (BTV2) has been
previously recorded in Calabria (Sicily), and in earlier years in Greece,
Turkey and Israel. It has never been recorded in North Africa. Efforts are
invested in detecting the origin of the virus and its route of introduction
into Sardinia". The writer should have referred to BTV4 rather than BTV2;
the latter virus had originated in North Africa (see postings 20030111.0091
and 20011122.2864). BTV4, the cause of the current outbreak in Sardinia,
had indeed been previously recorded in several Eastern Mediterranean
countries including Greece, Turkey, and Israel.
It is worthwhile mentioning that the sheep population in Sardinia was
vaccinated with a BTV2 vaccine early in 2002, followed by a significant
drop in the incidence of clinical bluetongue disease during the subsequent
disease season, May to December 2002. The Sardinian sheep population
remained susceptible to other BTV serotypes, however, against which BTV2
does not confer immunity. This might explain the current outbreak there,
reportedly caused by BTV4.
ProMED-mail is grateful to Dr Karim Ben-Jebara, head of the Animal Health
Information Department, Office International des Epizooties, for informing
us that bluetongue serotype 2 was initially recorded in Tunisia in 1999
followed by its subsequent notifications in 2000 and 2002, and that Algeria
notified its occurrence to the OIE in 2000.
It will be of interest to find out the origin of BTV4, a serotype never
recorded in North Africa, and its route of introduction into Sardinia. -
