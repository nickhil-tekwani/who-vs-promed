There have been 62 cases of measles in Bolton this year [2012] compared to just one last year.

Parents are being urged to make sure their children have had the MMR jab to protect them against the disease. Most of the children affected are babies under the age of 12 months, who are too young to have had the jabs, and youngsters aged about 11 to 14, whose parents decided not to get their children immunised after controversial research was published which claimed to link the MMR jab with autism.

In early December [2012], Harper Green Secondary School and a private nursery in Bromley Cross were hit by a measles outbreak affecting more than 30 children. Since then, there have been cases across Bolton.

Measles can cause lifelong problems and disabilities and in some cases can kill. It can lead to serious conditions including bronchitis, pneumonia, convulsions, encephalitis, which is swelling of the brain, and meningitis. Health protection specialist Graham Munslow, from NHS [National Health Service] Bolton, said it was the highest number of cases in Bolton in more than 12 years. He has urged parents to get their children vaccinated. He said: "It is not like chicken pox; measles is much more damaging to children."

Between 500 and 600 cases of measles were reported from different areas of Karachi over the last few weeks, and the number of children affected from the potentially deadly, airborne viral disease was on the rise, but provincial health authorities ... remained oblivious to the alarming situation ..., medical experts stated on Thursday [27 Dec 2012].

"I have seen 4 cases of measles myself. One was admitted to the Abbasi Shaheed hospital, one at Ziauddin Hospital, and 2 children were brought to my clinic who had measles," Pakistan Pediatric Association (PPA) President Professor Dr Iqbal Memon told The News. He said measles cases had been reported from Saddar, Orangi town, SITE, Sachal Goth, Gadap and Sohrab Goth. "Pediatricians are treating children with measles and also reporting these cases to town health officials and the WHO's Measles Cell. As per my knowledge, between 25 and 30 percent of measles cases of the total in Sindh were from Karachi. We have asked our member pediatricians to report measles cases to provincial and city health officials," he added.

Dr Memon said a special vaccination campaign against measles should also be launched in Karachi as children were contracting the viral disease. "Measles is an airborne viral disease, and it is a health risk for children who are not vaccinated against it," Dr Iqbal Memon said, adding that at least one round of measles vaccination was necessary in the metropolis. He suspected that Sindh health officials were more concerned about completing the polio vaccination drive, which was cancelled in Karachi on 18 Dec 2012 after the killing of 4 polio vaccinators. "1st, they are planning to administer oral polio vaccine drops to children, and then they might recognise the measles threat and take measures against the disease."

On the other hand, the Expanded Program on Immunisation (EPI) Sindh Project Director Mazhar Khamesani said no measles cases were reported from Karachi or brought to their knowledge by the city health authorities. "Normally, town officials report the cases to provincial health authorities, but so far, no cases have come to the fore," he claimed.

He said that EPI Sindh was launching a 10-day campaign in 7 districts of Sindh to vaccinate around 3 million children against measles from Mon 31 Dec 2012. The EPI Sindh Director said the outbreak of measles was reported from the rain-affected districts of Sindh, although there was no laboratory confirmation. "Like polio, measles cases have to be verified from the National Institute of Health (NIH) Islamabad, and to my knowledge, so far, the disease has not been detected in any samples," he said.

According to him, the districts that would be covered during the 10-day campaign included Khairpur, Sukkur, Shikarpur, Kashmore, Jaccobabad, Larkana and Qambar Shahdadkot. He lamented the fact that many parents do not take their children to doctors, and due to the complications, some children lost their lives. "During the campaign, children from 9 months to 10-years-old would be vaccinated against measles." Khamesani said that under the routine immunisation [programme], children are given 2 doses of vaccination against measles, one at 9 months and the 2nd at their 15th month.

The government has imposed a state of emergency in hospitals after 45 children died of measles in Kandhkot. The phase of casualties due to measles continued as the death toll of innocent children has risen to 45 within 21 days.

According to local people, within a short period of 21 days, at least 45 children have fallen victim to the disease, while hundreds of children are being treated in different hospitals. Terror and horror have gripped the entire area where people are scared of their future.

The Health Department has taken note and [declared] an emergency in government hospitals. According to health sources, blood samples of more than 100 children have been sent for medical tests.

On the other hand, locals have blamed lack of doctors and non-availability of vaccines at local hospitals during the outbreak.

Federal Minister for Religious Affairs, Khurshid Shah has said that an emergency has been declared in the places affected by the deadly outbreak of measles in Pakistan's Sindh province, which has so far claimed 50 lives.

"The move has been made following the rise in the death toll due to the epidemic," he said. He also said the deaths were due to the "negligence of officers of the health department."

It is believed that the 50 children lost their lives to the deadly disease in Kandhkot and other districts of the province in the last 2 weeks as a consequence of inadequate stock of measles vaccine.

[5] Canada (QC): super-spreading event
Date: Wed 26 Dec 2012

Despite very high measles immunization coverage in Quebec, the province was the site in 2011 of the largest measles outbreak in North America in the past decade. A study of the outbreak, published online in the Journal of Infectious Diseases on 21 Dec 2012 [Reference and Abstract below], found an unexpected vulnerability to illness even in recipients of a 2-dose vaccination regimen. Confirmed cases in the outbreak numbered 725, with 678 of them resulting from one super-spreading importation. The index case-patient in this importation was an adult who had traveled to the Caribbean in the spring, spending several hours at the Montreal airport. This person, who had received one dose of vaccine, worked in a high school; secondary infections spread over a period of 26 weeks. Overall, adolescents aged 12 to 17 years made up 56 percent of the cases in Quebec. Among patients in this age-group, 22 percent had received 2 doses of vaccine; illness was milder and was associated with a significantly lower risk of hospitalization in these patients compared with unvaccinated patients and those who had received just one dose. The authors state that the Quebec epidemic "provides an opportunity for jurisdictions with a stated goal of measles elimination to reflect both on the very [high] levels of population immunity required and how tenuous these levels may be."

Title: The largest measles epidemic in North America in a decade -- Quebec, Canada, 2011: Contribution of susceptibility, serendipity and super-spreading events on elimination. By Gaston De Serres and 11 others. In The Journal of Infectious Diseases, Advance Access, 10.1093/infdis/jis92 [edited] http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/12/19/infdis.jis923.short.

"Introduction: We describe the largest measles epidemic in North America in the last decade occurring in the population of Quebec, Canada in 2011 where one- and 2-dose vaccine coverage among children 3 years of age were 95-97 percent and 90 percent, respectively, with 3-5 percent unvaccinated.

Methods: Cases identified through passive surveillance and outbreak investigation were contacted to describe clinical course, vaccination status and possible source of infection.

Results: There were 21 measles importations and 725 cases. A super-spreading event triggered by one importation resulted in sustained transmission and 678 cases. The incidence per 100 000 was 9.1, highest in adolescents 12-17 years old (75.6) comprising 56 percent of cases. Among adolescent cases, 22 percent had received 2 vaccine doses. Outbreak investigation showed this proportion to have been an under-estimate: active case-finding identified 130 percent more cases among 2-dose recipients. Two-dose recipients had milder illness and significantly lower risk of hospitalization compared to unvaccinated or single-dose cases.

Conclusion: A chance super-spreading event revealed an overall level of immunity barely above the elimination threshold when taking into account unexpected vulnerability in 2-dose recipients. Unvaccinated individuals remain the immunization priority, but a better understanding of susceptibility in 2-dose recipients is needed to define effective interventions if elimination is to be achieved."

It will be relevant to determine whether the super-spreader event was related to the specific genotype of the imported virus or to the immune responses of those susceptible to infection. For a review, see: The genetic basis for inter-individual immune response variation to measles vaccine: new understanding and new vaccine approaches. Haralambieva IH et al., Expert Rev Vaccines. 2013 Jan;12(1):57-70. doi: 10.1586/erv.12.134.

The authors of this review reason that the live-attenuated measles vaccine is effective, but measles outbreaks still occur in vaccinated populations. This warrants elucidation of the determinants of measles vaccine-induced protective immunity. Inter-individual variability in markers of measles vaccine-induced immunity, including neutralizing antibody levels, is regulated in part by host genetic factor variations. There have been recent advances in understanding measles vaccine immunogenetics relative to the perspective of developing better measles vaccines. Important genetic regulators of measles vaccine-induced immunity, such as HLA class I and HLA class II genotypes, single nucleotide polymorphisms in cytokine/cytokine receptor genes (IL12B, IL12RB1, IL2, IL10), and the cell surface measles virus receptor CD46 gene, have been identified and independently replicated. These observations may help explain a variety of immune response-related phenotypes and promote a new paradigm of "vaccinomics" for novel vaccine development. - Mod.CP]
