Public's Help Sought in North Texas Rabies Alert
-------------------------------------------------
Texas Department of Health (TDH) rabies control officials are asking for
the public's help in locating the original owners of a puppy given away in
a Jack-in-the-Box parking lot in Decatur, in Wise County, on 19 Nov 2000.
The puppy, which was given to a resident of adjacent Montague County, has
tested positive for rabies.
Officials also are trying to locate people who may have been given other
puppies from the same litter.
Anyone who has information about the puppies' new or original owners should
contact Monty Fitzgerald, City of Decatur animal control officer, at
940-627-2741; or Jan Buck, regional zoonosis control technician with TDH's
regional office in Arlington, at 817-264-4920.
TDH officials believe the rabid puppy was exposed to rabies before being
given away. They said the other puppies in the litter also could have been
exposed to rabies and could spread the deadly virus to their owners and others.
Rabies is most often transmitted by bites, but transmission can occur in
other ways that allow the saliva from an infected animal to enter a
person's body. A series of post-exposure shots, if given in time, can
prevent rabies from developing. Once symptoms develop, rabies is almost
always fatal.
Rabies testing of the puppy was done in the TDH laboratory in Austin.
For more information contact Jan Buck, TDH Zoonosis Control Technician,
Arlington, at 817-264-4920; or Doug McBride, TDH Public Information
Officer,Austin, at 512-458-7524, or pager, 877-813-7943.
