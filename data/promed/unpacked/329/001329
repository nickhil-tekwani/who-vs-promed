CHOLERA - ZAIRE
===============
In the past three months there have been 22 outbreaks of cholera in Zaire. The
cases have thus far been in Bukama, Likasi and Kalemie provinces in the
southern mining district of Shaba; in Bolobo in Bandundu province; in Uvira
in Kivu province and the capital city of Kinshasa.
According to news sources, a local WHO official said there had been 10
deaths out of 60 reported cases, but it is not known if that number
represents a tally in Kinshasa or another location and for what period of
time. A doctor at the capital's Mama Yemo hospital said there had been 12
cases in the past three days at that one facility alone.
