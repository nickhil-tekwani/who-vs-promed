A new outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) has been found in the
village of Granichar, in the Burgas district, experts from the
Bulgarian Food Safety Agency announced Thursday [24 mar 2011]. Out of
7 samples, 6 have given positive results for FMD during routine checks
of all 130 animals in the village. They were owned by one farmer and
will be killed as soon as possible.

On 20 Mar 2011, a day before the European Commission was expected to
lift the measures, imposed on the Burgas district because of previous
FMD cases, a new outbreak was found at a private farm near the village
of Kirovo, close to the border with Turkey.

Cases of FMD appeared in Bulgaria at the beginning of the year [2011]
and were believed to have been transmitted from wild animals coming
from Turkey. There have been 5 outbreaks of the disease, all in the
Burgas district.

On Wednesday [23 Mar 2011], Bulgaria's Agriculture Minister Miroslav
Naydenov said that the idea for restoring the fence along the
Bulgarian-Turkish border as a measure against the spread of FMD is not
on the agenda anymore. In his words, the EC is expected to intervene
in Turkey, where there are more than 1000 FMD outbreaks. "The EC
agreed to provide additional EUR 1.5-2 M [approx. USD 2.1-2.8] to
Bulgaria for monitoring of the border with Turkey and for carrying out
additional maintenance," Naydenov said.
