Woraiyur locality in the city [Trichy] has come under the radar of the health department after typhoid cases soared in the area in the past one month. According to officials from the department, more than 40 cases of typhoid have been reported from Woraiyur since September [2018]. As a result, the department with the help of Trichy City Corporation (TCC), has been conducting inspections at Woraiyur in the past few days.

"The number of typhoid cases in Woraiyur area alone is pretty high. It's only because of water contamination due to pipeline leakage at Pai Kara street and Salai Road," a source from the health department said. Hence, the department, along with TCC, has been conducting door-to-door water supply inspections and checking for chlorine levels in the water through chloroscope. Apart from this, 2 medical camps have also been set up for the residents.

Typhoid fever is a bacterial infection caused by contaminated water or food. In India, it is caused predominantly more by contaminated water than by contaminated food.

Deputy director of health services, Trichy district, Dr A Subramani told TOI [Times of India] that intense work was being undertaken by the department with the help of the TCC. "The situation is already under control. The cases would decline henceforth," he said.

Meanwhile, dean of Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH) Dr G Anitha warned the people in Woraiyur area against eating outside food for a few days. She added, "In order to stay protected from typhoid, the foremost practice, which everyone has to follow, is to drink boiled water. I would also urge everyone to drink water supplied by the corporation. Getting packaged drinking water doesn't necessarily mean that it is clean.

[Typhoid fever, so-called enteric fever caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, has a totally different presentation from that of the commoner kinds of salmonellosis. Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the more commonly seen types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive.

The symptoms of classical typhoid fever typically include fever, anorexia, lethargy, malaise, dull continuous headache, non-productive cough, vague abdominal pain, and constipation. Despite the (often high) fever, the pulse is often only slightly elevated. During the 2nd week of the illness, there is protracted fever and mental dullness, classically called coma vigil. Diarrhea may develop but usually does not. Many patients develop hepatosplenomegaly (both liver and spleen enlarged). After the 1st week or so, many cases develop a maculopapular rash on the upper abdomen. These lesions ("rose spots") are about 2 cm (0.78 in) in diameter and blanch on pressure. They persist for 2-4 days and may come and go. Mild and atypical infections are common.

The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louse-borne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas, typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus. - Mod.LL
