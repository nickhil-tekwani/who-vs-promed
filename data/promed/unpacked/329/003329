Queen and Minister Verburg visiting goat farmer
-----------------------------------------------
Her Majesty the Queen has visited this morning a goat farm in Bakel,
Noord-Brabant. This holding has been hit by Q-fever. Later during the
morning the Queen spoke, in the town of Gemert-Bakel, with Q-fever
patients, a physician and a representative of the Regional Public
Health Service. Minister Verburg of the Ministry of Agriculture,
Nature and Food Quality accompanied the Queen.

The visit started at the town hall, where Jeroen Gosse (Director of
the Regional Affairs Directorate) briefly described the organization
and implementation of the culls. Subsequently, the Queen and Minister
Verburg paid a visit to the goat farm. They had a round tour of the
premises and spoke with the family members. The company included,
before the cull, about 700 goats. Following the discovery of the Q
fever bacterium, all 366 pregnant goats were killed a week ago.

Qatar - Rumors about Q-Fever denied
-----------------------------------
The Supreme Council of Health (SCH) has scotched rumors about the
spread of a new pandemic known as Q-Fever. Q-Fever is a known
infectious disease but it currently does not cause any concern
worldwide, the SCH said in a statement issued yesterday [Sun, 27 Dec
2009].

"Recently some news has been circulating about the spread of a new
pandemic known as Q-Fever. The SCH would like to inform the public
that the disease is currently restricted to the Netherlands.
Therefore it is not a disease that causes any concern right now,"
said the statement.

Q-Fever is not a new disease and it was reported before in all
continents. In 2009 around 2300 people around the world were infected
with Q-Fever with 6 fatalities, added the statement.

The disease usually infects veterinarians, meat workers, dairy
workers and farmers. The disease is caused by a species of bacteria
known as _Coxiella burnetii_ which comes out of cattle, sheep, goats
cats, dogs and some wild animals.

Direct transfer of the disease from a human being to another is rare;
however clothes of an infected person may transmit the disease.
Symptoms are shown in high fever, severe headache, malaise, myalgia,
confusion, sore throat, chills, sweat, non-productive cough, nausea,
vomiting and stomach and chest pain.

Antibiotic treatment is quite effective, namely doxycyclin. This
treatment is most effective during the 1st 3 days of the illness.
After full recovery the person may gain permanent immunity against
the disease in the future.

Q-Fever outbreaks occur mainly due to occupational exposure involving
veterinarians, meat processing plant workers, sheep and dairy
workers, livestock farmers and researchers at facilities housing
sheep.

[The culling of pregnant goats in the infected goat holdings in the
Netherlands is continuing in a pace of 3 holdings per day; as of Mon
28 Dec 2009 the operation was completed in 12 of the 61 infected
holdings.

Authorities in neighbouring Belgium, where, so far, 7 goat or sheep
holdings have been found Q-fever infected, have intensified their
preparedness, and are keeping an open eye for developments. However,
reportedly they are not overly concerned since the structure of the
dairy goat and sheep farming industry there is not similar to the one
prevailing in south Netherlands.


The Belgian Food Safety agency also took measures to safeguard the
adequate pasteurisation of sheep and goat milk before entering the
dairy plants. The newswire from Qatar is posted to demonstrate the
potential impact of a Q fever epizootic (of unusual dimensions and
probably enhanced, or unknown, pathogenicity) upon international
trade in animals and their products. This, in spite of the fact that
Q fever is generally not regarded as a trade-limiting factor, being
endemic in most countries and avoided by standard food-processing
techniques. Similar media reports appeared, several weeks ago, in
Russia.

On Tue 29 Dec 2009 the Dutch Veterinary Services submitted to the OIE
their 1st ("initial" and "immediate") notification on the Q fever
outbreak. The reason for the notification is given as "New strain of
a listed disease." The initial report provides information about one
goat farm in Waspik, Noord Brabant province. it is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/reports/en_imm_0000008788_20091229_155850.pdf>.


The epidemiological comments say: "There are 61 outbreaks of Q fever
at this moment in the Netherlands. The rest of the outbreaks will be
provided in the next weekly follow-up report."

Hopefully, the due weekly report will include further details,
explaining the decision of the Dutch Veterinary Services to define
the _Coxiella burnetii_ strain which is circulating in the
Netherlands as "new." As reported in posting 20091222.4312, a letter
from Dutch researchers, published in the US Centers for Disease
Control 'Emerging Infectious Diseases' journal of April 2009,
reported results showing "that the unprecedented, ongoing Q fever
outbreak in the Netherlands involves multiple genotypes of _C.
burnetii_. Because most of the genotypes differ only by a single
repeat difference, they might represent microvariants of a
hypervirulent strain that has been introduced in the Dutch animal
population." See at
