Between 15 Aug and 7 Sep 2013, 12 outbreaks of FMD type O were reported in cattle, sheep and goats in the Jafara, Misrata, Nuqat al Khams and Zliten districts in north western Libya. No genotyping has been performed [but see comment].

[The outbreak was reported earlier to the OIE, indicating a relatively high mortality in cattle (see posting 20130921.1960154).

Seven samples collected from FMD-affected cattle in Zliten (map at http://www.fallingrain.com/world/LY/45/Zlitan.html) on 1 Sep 2013 were received at the World Reference Laboratory for FMD, Pirbright, UK (WRLFMD) on 29 Oct 2013 and subsequently sequenced. The sequencing report was accomplished on 11 Nov 2013. The report has now been put on WRLFMD's website, after obtaining the consent of the Libyan authorities for publication, and is currently available at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/africa/lib.htm (scroll down to WRLFMD/2013/00021 29/10/2013 O).

Surprisingly, all 7 samples were found to be identical (100 per cent) to the Indian FMDV serotype O, topotype ME-SA, lineage (genotype/strain) 'Ind-2001 (KAR-13)' strain. The report includes, for each sample, a table of the most closely related reference viruses; the closest reference strain (vaccine strain) is O/BHU/3/2009 (96.09-96.24 identical).

A separate pdf document entitled "Phylogenetic report on FMDV serotype O in Libya and Bhutan 2013" provides additional useful information. The strain came from the Indian state of Karnataka.

How this Indian strain has reached Libya remains to be investigated. Is it restricted to Libya, or may have it been carried by animal consignments (or other means) to other countries?

Since mid-2013, an extensive FMD serotype O epizootic has been spreading in India's 4 southern states, including Karnataka. Reportedly, the efficacy of the vaccines applied there has been subject to debate.

Samples from suspected FMD cases in north Africa and the eastern Mediterranean should be submitted to reference laboratories to enable early and reliable assessment of the epidemiological situation for timely and, hopefully, effective prevention/control measures. - Mod.AS
