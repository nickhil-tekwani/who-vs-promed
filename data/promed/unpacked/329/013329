Dengue alert in New Delhi
---------------------------
NEW DELHI: The dreaded dengue has made a comeback after 7 cases were
reported from various parts of the Capital in the last week. 2 cases of
dengue had earlier been reported in January. Dengue claimed over 420 lives
in 1996.
The MCD sounded a general alert on how to prevent the breeding of the
_Aaedes aegypti_ mosquito vector, which [transmits dengue. It has
increased the number of people from 800 to 1,300 this year [who conduct
house-to-house searches and detect mosquito breeding.
The season for dengue starts from September, after the weather becomes
favorable for the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito. The mosquito needs fresh water
for its survival. The MCD has asked people to be cautious and not to allow
water to accumulate in and around their houses. The dengue mosquito is
generally found in coolers, used tires, overhead tanks and containers which
contain fresh water. The breeding cycle of the mosquito is one week. And if
water is changed and the container is cleaned, the mosquito gets killed.

Dengue fever in travellers to the Dominican Republic
------------------------------------------------------
BARCELONA: 2 additional reports of dengue fever in travellers from the
Dominican Republic have been notified by Joaquim Gascon. The first concerns
a 22-year old Spaniard who visiting the Dominican Republic (area of Palav√©)
for 1 month on business. He exhibited classical symptoms of Dengue at the
end of the trip. (Analytical findings: WBC: 4 500; platelets: 114 000;
lymphocytes: 6.2%; ASAT/ALAT: 24/16. Dengue serology: IgM+). The second
concerns a 24 year old Spanish woman who had visited the Dominican Republic
(Monte Plata, Aldea de Chirino) for 3 weeks as a tourist. She exhibited
classical symptoms of Dengue a few days after arrival in Spain. (Analytical
findings: WBC: 3 600; platelets: 96 000; ASAT/ALAT: 162/159. Dengue
serology: IgM +). A third [doubtful case concerns a Dominican Republic
woman who had lived in Spain since 1995. During a visit to her home country
during Aug 2000, she suffered a febrile illness and recovered after a few
days during the trip. 4 weeks after the illness she exhibited positive IgG
for Dengue (but was IgM -).
In 1999, TropMedEurop saw only 2 patients with dengue fever in total.
Together with the 3 patients that were reported 2 weeks ago, we have seen 5
patients now. It appears that the risk for dengue fever in this particular
region is currently increasing.

El Salvador To Punish Failure To Fight Dengue-carrying Mosquito
-----------------------------------------------------------------
SAN SALVADOR: The Salvadoran government on Thu 21 Sep 2000 announced that
fines of 1 000 to 100 000 colons [115 to 11 467 dollars would be imposed
on those who do not cooperate in the destruction of breeding sites for the
mosquitoes that transmit dengue, which has killed 28 children and 2 women
so far this year.
In a communique published in the local press, the Health Ministry said it
would enforce provisions in the health code that permit the issuance of
recommendations and imposition of sanctions on people or companies that do
not cooperate in resolving the problem. In addition, the ministry warned
that all companies and national or foreign institutions "are obligated to
participate in mosquito control projects on their property or
installations," and that all the country's residents should cooperate with
the Health Ministry in this effort.
The Salvadoran government declared a national emergency 12 Sep 2000 because
of the dengue epidemic, and has launched a media campaign to encourage the
public to destroy places where the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, which
transmits dengue, might breed.
Despite these efforts, Benjamin Bloom Hospital in San Salvador, the only
hospital in the country that specializes in pediatrics, is filled with
dengue patients, and 2 more children have died of dengue this week.
According to a Health Ministry official, cases of classic dengue have
increased to nearly 2 000 so far this year and cases of hemorrhagic dengue,
the deadly variety, rose to nearly 300 in the same period.
