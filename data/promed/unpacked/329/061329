The tiger mosquito has already colonized 51 French departments. According to Mosquito Vigilance, most departments that go on orange alert to the tiger mosquito then go on red alert.

The tiger mosquito, which arrived in France in 2004, is now established in 51 departments. It can carry diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus.

The tiger mosquito, or _ Aedes albopictus_, is a species capable of transmitting diseases such as dengue and chikungunya. It is a vector of the Zika virus. It has continued its progression in metropolitan France since 2004, the date of its 1st appearance in the southeast.

It was permanently established in 51 departments in 2018 versus 42 a year earlier, the Ministry of Health said. It is gaining more territory without ever leaving the colonized regions. Essentially urban, it likes places inhabited by humans.

The Mosquito Vigilance network classified French departments into 3 categories: in red vigilance, 42 departments where the tiger mosquito is established and active, in orange vigilance, 18 departments where it was intercepted during the last 5 years, in yellow, 34 departments that are on watch.

According to Mosquito Vigilance , most departments that go into orange alert then go on red alert.

In the west, after the Vendee, it is considered to be permanently settled in Maine-et-Loire and Loire-Atlantique. It is also well established in Paris.

The mere presence of the mosquito does not cause the appearance of the diseases of which it is the vector. The transmission is done when a "healthy" tiger mosquito bites a person who has been infected during a stay outside mainland France. The insect then becomes a carrier of the virus and can transmit it to a healthy person who has not lived outside the territory.

The high temperatures of recent days lead to the proliferation of the tiger mosquito, particularly in the Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur region (PACA), where the Regional Health Agency (ARS) has identified 18 dengue cases and one possible case of chikungunya [virus infection] at the end of June 2019.

"These are only imported cases, not indigenous," says the ARS, which warns, however: "What may happen is that these tiger mosquitoes bite carriers of the virus and infect other people." The ARS advises limiting the proliferation of the tiger mosquitoes.

The 1st cases of autochthonous infection appeared in metropolitan France in 2010, with 2 cases of dengue in the Alpes-Maritimes and 2 cases of chikungunya in the Var. Since then, the French authorities have recorded a total of 22 cases of dengue and 31 cases of chikungunya.

[_Aedes albopictus_ has been expanding its geographic range in southern Europe for several years. The rapid expanse northward in France is noteworthy. It has gone from 41 departments reported in April of last year (2018) to the 51 departments mentioned above. The above report has a map that illustrates the departments involved that can be accessed at the above URL. The established mosquito surveillance system in France doubtless will detect further expansion, which seems likely. The risk of initiation of ongoing transmission of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses following introduction from elsewhere will depend on mosquito and susceptible human population densities and the amount of time that people spend out-of-doors in areas where there is risk of bites by these mosquitoes. Eradication of this mosquito from France is not possible with current pest control measures. This will be an interesting situation to watch over the coming months and years. - Mod.TY
