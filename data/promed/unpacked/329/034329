Public Health England (PHE) is investigating an increase in cyclospora infections for the 4th successive year. Up to early August [2018], 57 cases had been reported in England, Scotland and Wales, of which 46 had traveled to Mexico.

For cases for which information is known, people who were infected stayed at several different hotels in the Cancun and Riviera Maya regions, mostly on an all-inclusive basis. Officials say that suggests the source is likely to be a foodstuff distributed to hotels in the area.

The outbreak is being monitored by PHE, Health Protection Scotland, Public Health Wales and the Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland.

Between 2005 and 2014, an average of 32 cyclospora cases were reported in England and Wales each year. Foods commonly contaminated with the parasite are soft fruits such as raspberries and salad products such as coriander, basil and lettuce.

Cyclospora infection, cyclosporiasis, causes watery diarrhea, nausea, loss of appetite and abdominal cramps, usually within 2-14 days after the ingestion of oocysts.

PHE said there may be substantial underreporting of cyclosporiasis cases because not all patients are tested for cyclospora and not all positive cases are reported by laboratories. The organisms can also be difficult to spot and recognize in unstained wet films or concentrates.

In 2015, _Cyclospora cayetanensis_ was identified in 176 returned travelers from the Riviera Maya region of Mexico between June and September; there were 79 cases in the UK and 97 in Canada.

One year later [2016], a similar outbreak in the UK involved 443 cases between June and October, 359 of whom reported travel to Mexico, mostly to the Riviera Maya and Cancun regions. France reported 6 confirmed and 3 probable cases in July and August 2016 in travelers from Mexico.

In 2017, 78 cases were recorded in the UK, of which 37 traveled to Mexico. However, 14 cases had traveled to 9 other overseas destinations and 7 had no overseas travel. Belgium noted 4 cases of cyclosporiasis in 2017, 3 of whom had a travel history to Mexico.

In an assessment last year [2017], the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said risk from cyclospora infection among travelers to Mexico was high because of the lack of confirmation of suspected vehicles and related control measures. Cyclosporiasis is not a mandatory notifiable disease in most European countries. The ECDC recommended awareness of the infection be raised among travelers and travel agencies, as well as clinical laboratories and healthcare professionals.

In the USA, there are 2 ongoing multistate outbreaks of cyclosporiasis. One is from Fresh Express salad mix sold at McDonald's restaurants. A total of 395 cases have been reported from 15 states, including 16 hospitalizations. The other is linked to Del Monte Fresh Produce vegetable trays, for which there were 237 laboratory-confirmed cases from 4 states. The trays contain broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and dill dip.

[Since 2015 there have been several reports of cyclosporiasis in Mexico, in travelers returning from Mexico, and from food manufactured in Mexico; see ProMED-mail reports listed below. Cyclosporiasis is transmitted through food contaminated with fecal material and less likely by water. There is no known animal reservoir for _Cyclospora cayetanensis_. - Mod.EP
