The Ministry of Health, Co-operatives and Women's Affairs of the Western
Provincial Council has cancelled all leave from today up to May 15 of all
hospital staff including doctors, nurses , administrative officers and
minor grade employees due to the currently spreading viral fever. However,
the Ayurveda sector has been exempted from this directive.
