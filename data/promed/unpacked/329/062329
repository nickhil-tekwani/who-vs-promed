China said on Friday [19 Apr 2019] that it had confirmed outbreaks of African swine fever [ASF] in 2 locations in Hainan province, an island off its southern coast. The incurable disease was found on 2 small pig farms in Danzhou city and 2 farms in Wanning city.

The disease has now been found in every province and region on the mainland, including Hainan Island, since it was 1st detected in August 2018.

[The province Hainan is the southernmost of China's 31 provincial-level divisions, which include 22 sheng (provinces), 5 zizhiqu (autonomous regions), and 4 shih (municipalities under direct control of the central government). Since 3 Aug 2018, the official starting date of the ASF event in China, all 31 have become infected, surpassing even pessimistic forecasts. There are 3 other territories that are named in some published statistics related to the Chinese ASF event, namely, the special autonomous regions Hong Kong and Macau, as well as Taiwan, which is not controlled by the PRC. No local ASF outbreaks have been reported from the indigenous pig populations of these 3 territories.

Hainan is China's (PRC) smallest province. It consists of various islands in the South China Sea. Hainan Island, separated from Guangdong's Leizhou Peninsula by the Qiongzhou Strait, is the largest and most populous island under PRC control. It is slightly smaller than Taiwan.
