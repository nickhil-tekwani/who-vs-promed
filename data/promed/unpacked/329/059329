Petaling Jaya: The manufacturer of Ciprofloxacin has warned that this
product was to be used on humans only.
In a statement issued here yesterday, Bayer AG said the antibiotic should
not be used on chickens.
"The wrongful use of any antibiotic on poultry and livestock may lead to
cross-resistances which render the antibiotic ineffective against human
infection," it said.
Last week, the authorities seized counterfeit antibiotics from chicken
breeders in Negri Sembilan.
The breeders believed to be injecting chickens with the antibiotic.
