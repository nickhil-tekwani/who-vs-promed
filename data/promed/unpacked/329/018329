Two cadavers of wild boar, infected with African swine fever [ASF], have been found in the military camp 'Lagland' near Arlon [Luxembourg province] [see commentary].

The boars had probably died in early September [2018], possibly as the 1st animals that became infected and spread the virus, according to 'De Standaard' [http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20181006_03816061].

To date, how the virus ended up in Belgium is a matter for speculation.

Possible explanations are that wild boar ate contaminated food waste, or that 'hunting tourism' introduced it from Eastern Europe. There is now a 3rd possibility: in Lagland, there is a coming and going of Czech, Polish, and Belgian soldiers who have been in the Baltic states -- countries where ASF already occurs. The camp is located in the zone that has been closed due to the [ASF] event, and has by now been fully disinfected.

In the Netherlands, worried pig farmers already staged last weekend [29-30 Sep 2018] warning signs along highways, addressing foreign drivers. This weekend [6-7 Oct 2018] the Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA) places 150 information boards on parking places along motorways and nature reserves. Transporters, travelers, and holidaymakers are told to throw food waste into closed trash cans.

Federal MP [member of parliament] Georges Dallemagne (cdH [Humanist Democratic Centre party]) will soon be questioning Defense Minister Steven Vandeput (N-VA [New Flemish Alliance party]) in the House about the discovery of several cadavers of wild boars, one of which has been tested positive for the African swine fever virus, in the Lagland military camp in the province of Luxembourg.

In particular, Mr Dallemagne wishes to obtain details on the number of cadavers found, as well as on the timing of the discoveries and the way in which the information was processed.

He will also ask the Minister for clarification regarding the participation of Belgian troops in exercises abroad, in areas infected by the virus, or the training of foreign troops on Belgian soil.

"Is there any exchange between the staff of the different infected countries? Has training been given? Are our soldiers and those in the countries concerned aware of the means of propagation of the virus and basic measures of biosecurity?" asks the humanist MP, who considers it "urgent to have answers to these questions".

According to him, the measures taken by the Walloon Minister of Agriculture, his party colleague Ren√© Collin, "are good, but cannot be the only ones." He insists that "the other departments are equally mobilized."

The Lagland military camp is located in the 63 000 hectares [about 156 000 acres] of forest affected by the movement ban within the framework of the management of ASF.

[A map showing the location of the Lagland military camp is available at http://wikimapia.org/7217894/Camp-Lagland. The following information on the camp is derived from the official Belgian Ministry of Defence website "Defensie" (https://www.mil.be/nl/eenheden/kamp-lagland; in Dutch, trans. Mod.AS):

"In the Camp Lagland, 80 military personnel work to offer training infrastructure to combat and reconnaissance troops.
The camp is located in the far south of Belgium, near the city of Arlon, and covers an area of 2600 hectares [about 6425 acres]. Nearby are also the Infantry Department and the Center for Basic Training and South Schooling.

"Camp Lagland is a national competence center for training in military operations in built-up areas. For this the soldiers built the artificial village of Asperulange, which consists of about 40 houses. The camp has numerous shooting ranges and extensive practice areas for tactical training.

"Because of the risks of regular target practice, access to the military site is forbidden for all citizens. Due to its great diversity of fauna and flora, the entire camp is completely in the protected nature zone 'Natura 2000'.
Only in exceptional cases can the camp commander grant derogations, for youth movements, scientific research, or exceptional sports activities.

"Camp Lagland puts 2 bivouac zones (for 60 or 200 people) at the disposal of recognized youth movements. Because the military domain remains open as a training ground, both zones are only accessible during the Easter holidays (one week) and in August".

According to a later report in 'De Standaard', dated 7 Oct 2018, Belgium's Federal Food Agency (FASFC) considers that the theory of Belgian soldiers introducing the ASF virus after operations in the Baltic countries is "unlikely". "'Defense uses strict decontamination procedures', says Philippe Houdart of the FASFC. 'It is more likely that an Eastern European van was throwing its roll of contaminated salami into a parking lot and that was eaten by wild boars here.'" The FASFC's comment did not address the scenario of foreign soldiers training in Lagland.

The response further says, that 4 wild boar cadavers were found in the camp, of which 2 were found infected. After the diagnosis, "Lagland's military training area, near Arlon, has been stationary for 3 weeks. The camp is threatened with a closure of several months to a year." (http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20181007_03817143; in Dutch, trans. Mod.AS).

According to the FASFC's website, updated 8 Oct 2018, the number of wild boar confirmed as infected in Belgium's SE province Luxembourg since 13 Sep 2018, has risen to 53. - Mod.AS
