Boston: Latest Measles Case Brings Total to 14
-----------------------------------------------
As of Wed 21 Jun 2006, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health
confirmed another case of measles yesterday, bringing the total to 14
since early May 2006 [see ProMED-mail post archived as: Measles
outbreak, office building - USA (MA) 20060524.1462]. The patient, a
woman in her early 20s, has recovered from the disease and is back at
work at Hill Holiday, a communications company in the John Hancock
Tower, where the outbreak began. No other suspect cases have been
identified within Hill Holiday. For more information on measles, visit

Boston: Measles Outbreak Shows Even Vaccinated Are at Risk
-----------------------------------------------
A measles outbreak in Boston is showing how the global economy opens
opportunities for one of the world's most contagious viruses. Disease
detectives say a computer programmer from India brought the virus to
Boston's tallest office tower. The outbreak reveals that millions of
Americans in their 30s and 40s are vulnerable to measles, even though
they were vaccinated years ago.

[The NPR report indicated in addition that many of the cases are in
people in their 30s and 40s, suggesting that the vaccine used in the
1960s was not as effective as the current vaccine (or alternatively,
that immunity may have diminished over time). - Correspondent Sharon Minnick]

Additional Measles Case Confirmed
-----------------------------------------
The Massachusetts Department of Public Health confirmed an additional
case of measles in a Boston resident/worker. According to the Boston
Public Health Commission (BPHC), the total of confirmed measles cases
is (14) in Boston (12 in Boston workers and 2 in Boston residents).
The newly confirmed case, a women in her early 20's, is a resident of
South Boston and a worker at Hill Holiday, a communications company
located in the Hancock Tower. The case was suspected in early June
2006, and public health measures were taken in partnership with the
company to limit the potential spread of illness. Lab tests conducted
at the State Laboratory Institute were negative for measles, however,
specimens were sent for more sensitive testing at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. BPHC was notified of
the results last evening [19 Jun 2006].
The newly confirmed case has recovered from her illness and is back
at work. The incubation period -- the time during which other cases
could be identified at the company -- ends today [20 Jun 2006], and
no additional suspect cases have been identified within Hill Holiday.
City health officials continue to work with the company to monitor
the health of all other employees.
Clusters of measles are rare, because most people in the United
States are vaccinated. However, health officials say the illness is a
reminder for people to check whether they are properly immunized
against measles, particularly for those immunized in between 1963 and
1968, when an ineffective vaccine was used.
Early symptoms include a high fever, runny nose, cough and red,
watery eyes. A skin rash usually occurs about 2-4 days after the
initial symptoms develop. The rash begins on the face and soon
spreads to other parts of the body. The rash usually lasts 4-7 days
and then disappears in the same order it appeared (head to foot).
Koplik spots (little white spots) may become visible inside the
cheeks of the mouth 1-2 days before or after skin rash onset.
The BPHC, working in conjunction with the State Department of Public
Health, has provided information to healthcare providers throughout
the city asking that they be on alert for potential measles cases and
to report those cases immediately to health authorities. Other local
health departments throughout the Commonwealth are undertaking
similar efforts with MDPH to notify providers and to identify suspect cases.

[This unusual measles outbreak located predominately in a single
office building in Boston, a city free of measles since 1995, appears
to be associated with recruitment of a computer programmer from
India. Although the outbreak may now have been contained, it does
reveal a less than satisfactory level of protection in people of
working age in Boston. - Mod.CP]
