The Nigerian Veterinary Association says the highly pathogenic H5N1
strain of bird flu remains a major problem in Nigeria and warns that
the country risks triggering an even bigger round of infection.
Veterinary Association spokesman Bala Mohammed says more states have
reported new cases of the disease, in the last few weeks.
"What we considered a resurgence is becoming alarming. From an
initial 3, then 10 states, almost all the states have been having a
recurrence," he said. "That is a very serious challenge and it also
calls for a review of the entire process that we adopted. In the last
month, we've heard about Delta State, Akwa Ibom, Rivers, Cross River
and a lot of cases in Lagos."
Nigeria and 2 other countries are considered the weakest link in the
worldwide campaign to stem the disease.
John Lange heads the U.S government programs for foreign governments
and international organizations to deal with avian influenza. He says
Nigeria should step up its surveillance program.
"It is very important having the federal government working closely
with state governments and local government areas to fully implement
their plans on avian influenza. And, as part of that strategy is the
need to undertake surveillance activities, to send veterinarians and
others to all the states of Nigeria to really verify the level of
avian influenza outbreaks," he said.
Millions of birds have died or become infected in Nigeria since the
avian flu outbreak was first detected, last February, causing severe
hardship for farmers, who have had very little support from the
government.
Veterinary officials believe widespread disaffection with the
compensation system put in place by the government is keeping farmers
from reporting bird deaths, making tracking of the virus more
difficult.
Garba Sharabutu is a veterinarian and president of the Nigerian
Veterinary Association. "We had cause to disagree with the government
over this compensation. The first signal that the disease, avian
influenza, is on a farm is when you estimate the total loss to be
more than 50 percent," he noted. "Now, when move in there and you go
and pay for those animals that you were able to actually destroy,
when know that the cardinal signal is that 50 percent have already
died, you go and pay compensation for only 50 percent, there is going
to be a problem."
Lange, who met several poultry farmers on his recent trip to Nigeria,
acknowledges that the compensation package for farmers is a huge
drawback. He says it is more of an international problem.
"The idea that the birds will be culled so that there will be no more
outbreaks from that particular infection and then compensating the
owners is an issue not just in Nigeria, but all over the world. In
fact, at a meeting in Vienna, Austria, in June, we discussed the need
for more expertise on culling and compensation," he added. "I
discussed that here and, in fact, when we met yesterday with the
Kaduna State Poultry Association, they were frustrated at the delays
for receiving compensation for birds that have been culled."
Backyard farmers are particularly at risk because of poor
surveillance and greater human-to-animal contact.
The United Nations Food and Agricultural Association estimates that
backyard poultry farmers keep 60 percent of Nigeria's 140 million
poultry.
Mohammed says, with major Christian and Muslim festivities planned
for the next couple of weeks, the risk of bird flu is even more acute.
"I look at seasons like this where you have festive seasons;
Christmas, Sallah [the common name for Eid ul-Fitr, the day that ends
the fasting month of Ramadan; for more information, see
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_ul-Fitr>] and New Year, as an
important season when we must step up public enlightenment," he
added. "You will agree with me that these are the periods people go
for these chickens and they do it all cost. Everybody must have
chicken on his table. It is a very big issue in Nigeria."
Experts on bird flu are increasingly worried that Nigeria risks
becoming a permanent host to the virus.

[2] China: closure of live poultry markets?

The government in Beijing, China, has made a ban on live poultry
markets permanent.
Beijing's Municipal Bureau of Agriculture said last week that the
city will ban live poultry markets permanently.
According to the bureau, the move is part of its effort to comply
with a newly issued document by the State Council that calls for
gradually moving live poultry markets away from urban areas in a
renewed effort to combat the bird flu.
Beijing suspended live poultry trade, as well as bird marketing and
pigeon shooting from last November, when several outbreaks were
confirmed in its neighboring provinces like Liaoning and Inner
Mongolia.
In June 2006, the city noticed that the trade could be resumed as
long as live poultry markets or shops get certification from local
veterinary inspection agencies. But according to the bureau, none of
the shops have been certified yet.
Scientists from Chinese Academy of Sciences said it is poultry
rearing and trade causes the spread of bird flu, and restricting the
number of live poultry markets is essential to control the disease.

[3] South Korea: 4th outbreak

A 4th case of bird flu has been discovered in South Korea after
culling of poultry from earlier cases, a government official said on
Thursday, raising concerns that quarantine measures had failed to
control the outbreak.
South Korea confirmed in November its 1st case of the H5N1 strain in
about 3 years.
The 3 initial cases were found in farms in the North Cholla province,
around 170 km (100 miles) south of Seoul. The latest case emerged at
a duck farm in Asan, South Chungcheong province, about 100 km further
north.
"We confirmed that a case at a duck farm in Asan was highly
pathogenic," an official at the agriculture ministry said.
There were no reports suggesting human infection, the official added.
Quarantine authorities would cull 23 000 poultry within a 3-km radius
of the latest infected farm.
Between December 2003 and March 2004, about 400 000 poultry at South
Korean farms were infected by bird flu. During that outbreak, the
country destroyed 5.3 million birds.

[4] Viet Nam (Mekong Delta)

Vietnam's first outbreak of bird flu since August has spread to 4
more areas in the Mekong Delta, where nearly 8300 birds have been
killed by the virus or slaughtered to hold it back, the Agriculture
Ministry said.
Three outbreaks spotted between 11 Dec and 20 Dec 2006 in Ca Mau
province killed over 2500 chickens and ducks, while one in
neighbouring Bac Lieu province killed dozens of ducks, the ministry's
Animal Health Department said in a report on Thursday [21 Dec 2006].
The outbreaks of the H5N1 virus were the 1st in Vietnam since August.
The initial eruptions killed around 6000 newly hatched chickens and
ducklings that were not vaccinated against bird flu.
Farmers have since thrown dead birds into water channels or let ducks
roam on rice fields, helping spread the virus that first arrived in
the Delta in late 2003 and has since killed 42 of the 93 people
infected in Vietnam.
Vietnam, which has had no human bird flu cases since late 2005, has a
human death toll second only to Indonesia's 57, according to the
World Health Organisation (WHO).
WHO says bird flu has killed 154 people out of 258 infected globally
since late 2003.
Vietnamese animal health officials said on Wednesday that
temperatures were falling in the southern region incorporating the
delta, which would help the spread of a virus that thrives best in
cooler temperatures.
Experts fear the virus could mutate into a form that is easily
transmissible among humans and spark an influenza pandemic that would
kill millions.
The Mekong Delta outbreaks caused health officials in nearby Ho Chi
Minh City, Vietnam's largest city, to tighten inspection of poultry
and step up monitoring of breeding farms, state media reported on
Thursday.

[The reappearance of H5N1 in distant locations within the northern
hemisphere during December might be indicative of the suggested
possible role of migratory birds in the dissemination of the virus.
However, other factors are not to be neglected; one of them being the
use of deficient, non-certified vaccines, as remarked by subscriber
Dr. Peter Petermann. He concludes: "The continued attempt to put all
the blame on 'migratory wild birds' while consistently failing to
produce any hard evidence is more and more appearing as a cover-up to
protect the interests of vaccine producers".
Comprehensive surveillance activities in wild birds are being
undertaken by EU member-states; their last update of 30 Nov 2006, is
graphically presented under the title "HPAI cases in wild birds in
the MSs -- total 748 infected birds/Cases notified to ADNS (Animal
Disease Notification System) from 1 Feb to 30 Nov 2006", accessible
at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/adns/adns_wildbirds.pdf>.
The data gathered during the coming winter months might be helpful in
objectively evaluating the possible role of migratory birds in the
epidemiology of HPAI H5N1. - Mod.AS]
