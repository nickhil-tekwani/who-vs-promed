99/146 EPPO report on selected intercepted consignments
The EPPO Secretariat has gathered the intercepted consignment reports for
1999 received since the previous report (EPPO RS 99/112) from the following
countries: Austria, Croatia (2 interceptions for 1998), Czech Republic,
Denmark, Estonia, France, Finland, Germany, Guernsey, Ireland, Israel,
Italy, Jersey, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Sweden,
Switzerland, United Kingdom.
When a consignment has been re-exported and the country of origin is
unknown, the re-exporting country is indicated in brackets. When the
occurrence of a pest in a given country is not known to the EPPO
Secretariat, this is indicated by an asterisk (*).
The EPPO Secretariat has selected interceptions made because of the
presence of pests. Other interceptions due to prohibited commodities,
missing or invalid certificates are not indicated. It must be pointed out
that the report is only partial, as several EPPO countries have not yet
sent their interception reports.
Note: the EPPO RS 98/077 mentioned an Italian interception of seed potatoes
from Canada infected by _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. sepedonicus.
NAPPO has informed the EPPO Secretariat that the Italian authorities have
performed further tests (biological tests) and that the results obtained
have excluded the presence of _C. m. subsp. sepedonicus_ in the seed potato
samples in question, which should therefore be considered as free from this
bacterium.
