The appearance of 2 cases of facial paralysis, or Guillain-Barre
syndrome, awakened an alert to the possible presence of poliomyelitis
in Buenaventura [Colombia].
According to Esneda Mosquera, an employee of the Secretariat of
Health of Buenaventura, the cases should be classified as probable,
although they are awaiting laboratory test results, which will clarify
what disease is being treated.
One of the cases presented is in La Neta, Cajambre, where a 4-year-old
girl was initially diagnosed by a private physician as having wild polio
[polio caused by wild poliovirus, as compared with vaccine virus-
associated polio - Mod.MPP]. Later on, in the Departmental Hospital
of Buenaventura, it was determined that the child had a mild acute
facial paralysis, or Guillain-Barre syndrome.
"From here the child was transferred to Cali, to the same place where a
5-year-old boy, resident of the urban zone, barrio Juan XXIII, [is
hospitalized?] with the same symptoms," stated Mosquera, who put all
health units on alert through the convocation of an Epidemiologic
Surveillance Committee, or COVE.
Due to a strike in the Municipal Health sector which ended last Friday,
they were not able to conduct a vaccination campaign in the zones
surrounding the neighborhood [of residence of the suspected case].
It is hoped that by tomorrow, the local health units will conduct an
intense search for cases of acute facial paralysis, especially in the
population under 15 years of age.
"Poliomyelitis has been eradicated in Colombia, but we should be alert
to avoid the introduction of this [polio] in our territory," signaled
Herna Saa, Secretary of Health of Valle, who stressed that the activation
of the COVE or municipal analysis units [has been undertaken] in
order to intensify surveillance for poliomyelitis, with inter-institutional
participation and [input from] the community.

[The last wild poliovirus detected in the Americas was on 5 Sep 1991
in Peru. According to the most recent Poliomyelitis weekly bulletin of
PAHO, to date there have been 25 cases of acute flaccid paralysis
identified for investigation in Colombia for 2001:
<http://www.paho.org/English/HVP/HVI/Spe1621.pdf>
This is not an alarming number of cases, but rather an indication of a
well-functioning surveillance system to detect cases of acute flaccid
paralysis.
In this article, the press refers to acute facial paralysis syndrome as a
form of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). GBS is a clinical syndrome
associated with acute onset of weakness or ascending paralysis, usually
symmetrical, associated with sensory deficits. It is felt to be an
immune-mediated disorder that frequently has been preceded by an
infectious disease such as a viral or bacterial illness. (Readers are
reminded of the outbreak of GBS associated with receipt of the swine
flu vaccine in the USA in 1976.) Since the eradication of wild
poliomyelitis in the Americas Region, GBS is the leading cause of acute
flaccid paralysis in the region. Cases of GBS have been associated with
poliovirus infection and with exposure to polio vaccine virus.
An isolated acute facial paralysis is usually referred to as Bell's Palsy.
Bell's Palsy is a unilateral facial paralysis of acute onset, frequently
idiopathic in origin. It can be seen associated with a herpes zoster
infection, but varicelliform lesions are typically present. It is also
seen in association with Lyme disease (caused by _Borrelia
burgdorferi_) & HSV1 infection, and there is an ongoing debate on the
appropriateness of treatment with acyclovir. There have been reports
of Bell's Palsy associated with poliovirus infection as well as with
exposure to polio vaccine virus.
The article mentions that there is an ongoing search for additional cases
of facial paralysis. Presumably there is also an ongoing search for any
case of acute flaccid paralysis. Sticking my neck out on the chopping
block, I would venture to state that if these 2 cases are clinically pure
facial paralysis, it is unlikely that they are due to wild poliovirus
infection. It is more likely that they are associated with vaccine virus,
but this is still not high on the list of probable explanations.
More information on these cases in terms of clinical presentation and
laboratory results would be very much appreciated.
