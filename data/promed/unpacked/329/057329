3rd case of Legionnaires' disease in Ocean City, Maryland
-----------------------------------------------
The Worcester County Health Department is reporting a 3rd case of
Legionnaires' disease associated with an Ocean City (MD) condominium. As
with the 2 previous cases, this case is associated with the Braemar Tower
condominium complex on 131st Street.
The 1st 2 patients stayed in separate units in the complex over the
holidays, and one of them died. The condition of the person in the latest
case isn't known, but health officials say the person is alive.
While health officials can't confirm the patients contracted Legionnaires'
at the condo, water samples from several locations inside tested positive
for the bacterium that causes the disease. The condominium owners treated
the water over the weekend. The health department will do follow-up testing
in the next few days.

[What may be very important about these cases is that, as holiday
condominiums and possibly time-share ones, there may be (and probably are)
other cases associated with the complex, perhaps residing outside of
Maryland. It should be noted that the isolation of _L. pneumophila_ from
water samples does not immediately identify the source, as the human
strains may be a different legionella from the water strain. - Mods.LL/MPP]
