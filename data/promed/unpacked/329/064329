A 9-year-old girl has died from avian influenza in eastern China,
bringing the country's death toll from the disease to 10, the
official Xinhua news agency reported on Wednesday 8 Mar 2006. The
girl died on Monday [6 Mar 2006] night in Zhejiang province "after
all rescue efforts failed," Xinhua stated, quoting the information
office of the Ministry of Health. She had been diagnosed with bird
flu in late February 2006 after visiting relatives who kept poultry,
Xinhua said previously.
The 9th case, a 32-year-old man, died from the H5N1 avian influenza
virus infection on Thursday [2 Mar 2006] in the southern province of
Guangdong, near Hong Kong. He was believed to have contracted the
virus at a poultry market.

Zhejiang province is in eastern China, bordering the East China Sea.
One of the smallest of the Chinese provinces, it includes the
southern half of the populous Yangtze River delta in the north; a
complex of rugged mountain ranges, with heights of more than 1900 m
(6200 ft) in places, in the south; and the offshore islands of the
Zhoushan Archipelago, situated at the entrance to Hangzhou Bay. Rice
and silk are important lowland crops, with tea a major product in
upland areas. - Mod.CP]
