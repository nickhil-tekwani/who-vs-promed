Suspected Japanese Encephalitis Outbreak in Village in Bangladesh
-----------------------------------------------------------------
MEHERPUR: Five more members of the same family in the village of Chandpurm
[Sadar Upazila district] died of a mysterious disease today [Fri 11 May
2001]. As a result the death toll has risen to 9.
After fighting for life for the last 5 days, the 3 sons, one
daughter-in-law and one son-in-law of a septuagenarian villager died of the
unidentified disease today at Dhaka Medical College Hospital and Meherpur
General Hospital. Some other members of the family and a few other
villagers [are seriously ill]. Panic has prevailed in the area since Tue 1
May 2001 following [the initial outbreak] of disease.
Talking to The Bangladesh Observer, the Civil Surgeon Dr. Abdul Malek
quoting the Director of Disease Control in Dhaka stated that the disease is
probably the mosquito-transmitted Japanese encephalitis. The [Divisional]
Commissioner Begum Momtaz Ahmed and the Civil Surgeon have visited the area
and advised the villagers to take effective measures to combat the
situation. A medical team has been formed [at the village to provide
assistance].
