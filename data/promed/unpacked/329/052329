--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In regard to MRSA in the ocean, we have been concerned about the role
that ocean water may play in staphylococcal infections in Hawaii
recreational seawater for more than a decade.

Initial studies suggested there was a correlation with some water
sports such as paddling, but it is not clear the association is any
greater than that with other sports involving scrapes, scratches or
trauma -- such as with football. Sharing or re-using equipment and
basic hygiene may also be relevant.

Hawaii has one of the highest rates of hospital MRSA in the nation
according to an earlier APIC [Association for Professionals in
Infection Control and Epidemiology] survey. We found a MRSA carriage
rate of about 2-5 percent in a healthy college student study (in
addition to the normal 30 percent rate for _Staphylococcus aureus_).
Emergency Department wound cultures for MRSA are higher than in the
normal population. We have also cultured wounds among the large
homeless population here and found a high frequency of the USA300
strain. Surveys of the students and the homeless for recreational
seawater exposure did not find a clear association, but the numbers
were relatively small

We have also tried to recover _S. aureus_ from recreational seawater
but find it in only very low concentrations and below practical
detection if there are not bathers present to shed the organism. The
deeper is the seawater, the less likely the recovery of staphylococci.
There does not appear to be a colonization or carrier state among fish
or aquatic mammals that we have detected.

The fear of staphylococcal infections and MRSA infections still deters
bathing and surfing and paddling, but it seems there is not a clear
relationship or cause for concern. The high incidence of MRSA
infections among the Atlantic rowers is likely related to the gear
they use or share or the staphylococci they carry that infect the
wounds they have in their rather suicidal missions.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Alan Tice for his contribution. This comment
from Dr. Tice is in response to a recent ProMED-mail post on an
outbreak of community-associated methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus
aureus_ (CA-MRSA) infection in open ocean rowers (Staph. aureus
(MRSA), comm acq - Canada: (BC) rower 20110812.2452).

At least 9 of the 14 crew members who participated in this
transatlantic rowing expedition developed extensive furuncles and
carbuncles, and 3 of the 9 required hospitalization. One woman rower
developed disseminated CA-MRSA infection with multi-organ failure
several months after the rowing expedition. Secondary transmission
also occurred among household members. - Mod.ML]
