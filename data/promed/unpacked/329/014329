Gonorrhoea is a sexually transmitted infection caused by a bacterium called _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_. This infection affects 87 million people every year across the world. It can lead to genital discharge, pregnancy complications and infertility. Gonorrhoea can be treated successfully with antibiotics [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6452490/].

Current first-line treatment is a ceftriaxone injection combined with azithromycin given as oral tablet. But in recent years, alarming reports emerged of these drugs failing to treat gonorrhoea patients. Drug resistance has been reported in Asia, Europe and Australia. Most of these infections were in populations at high risk for sexually transmitted infections. They include commercial sex workers and men who have sex with men. Continued increase in resistance and the limited pipeline of new antibiotics have raised global concerns about the development of untreatable gonorrhoea. It prompted the World Health Organisation to classify _N. gonorrhoeae_ as a high-priority pathogen for the development of new antibiotics.

The African region has the highest burden of gonorrhoea worldwide. In South Africa alone, it is estimated that more than 2 million new cases occur annually. Yet there isn't much information about antibiotic resistance. The lack of data poses a serious public health challenge. Drug-resistant _N. gonorrhoeae_ infection, when introduced, could spread widely before being detected. It would most likely emerge in high-risk populations. In a recent study we found a high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in _N. gonorrhoeae_ strains obtained from high-risk men in South Africa.

South Africa manages sexually transmitted infections by giving patients a combination of antibiotics that covers the most likely cause of their symptoms. There is no laboratory confirmation of the cause. In suspected cases of gonorrhoea, patients would get medication without diagnostic testing. This approach is used in other resource-constrained countries too. It is relatively cheap and easy. But it also leads to unnecessary use of antibiotics. This, in turn, contributes to resistance development. To prevent an outbreak of infections that resist multiple drugs, the country should introduce diagnostics and scale up surveillance for gonorrhoea.

We recently analysed _N. gonorrhoeae_ strains obtained from 42 high-risk men presenting with gonorrhoea symptoms at public healthcare facilities in Johannesburg, South Africa (1). Each bacterial strain was grown on a culture plate from urine samples. In the laboratory we tested how well individual drugs worked on each of these bacterial strains.

Drug resistance rates were alarming. Almost 30% of strains were classified as multidrug-resistant (resistant to more than 3 drugs). Almost 80% were resistant to ciprofloxacin. This drug was used to treat gonorrhoea in South Africa until 2008. Also, 15% of the strains were resistant to azithromycin. Fortunately, no resistance to cefixime and ceftriaxone was present. Most of the bacterial strains were unique to South Africa and genetically different from those reported elsewhere in the world.

Despite the relatively small sample size, this study highlights important gaps in the response to the global threat of drug-resistant gonorrhoea. First, it shows the importance of investing in drug resistance surveillance at a large scale across the country. The current surveillance performed in South Africa can only accommodate a limited number of facilities. High-risk populations are also not included.

Levels of ciprofloxacin resistance are consistently high across the country (more than 65%), but prevalence of azithromycin resistance is variable. A recent study from KwaZulu-Natal province found azithromycin resistance in 68% of _N. gonorrhoeae_ bacteria; 71% were multidrug-resistant. In contrast, surveillance sites reported azithromycin resistance in less than 5% of samples.

These differences warrant an intensive effort to determine the level of azithromycin resistance across the country. Depending on the outcome, it might be necessary to reconsider using this drug. Fortunately, ceftriaxone resistance was not detected in any of these studies. It remains the drug of choice to treat gonorrhoea.

Second, the high-risk populations, especially men who have sex with men, must be included in gonorrhoea surveillance programmes. Historically, drug-resistant gonorrhoea emerged first in these populations. For example, the first 2 cases of cefixime-resistant gonorrhoea in South Africa occurred in 2012 in men who have sex with men. Since then, several more cases have been identified. Similarly, azithromycin resistance was detected in 15% of the high-risk men with gonorrhoea in Johannesburg. National surveillance of the general population detected it in less than 2% of _N. gonorrhoeae_ strains in that city.

Further, there's a need for more specific care. Point-of-care tests would enable targeted antibiotic treatment of infections. Additional diagnostic tests are needed to manage individuals with treatment failure. This requires further investment in laboratory resources, logistics and infrastructure so that specimens can be stored and transported between the healthcare facility and laboratory. The biological nature of _N. gonorrhoeae_ makes these requirements even more complicated.

Finally, development of new drugs is essential. Good news is the recent start of a multicountry trial of zoliflodacin as a potential treatment for gonorrhoea.

The global threat of drug-resistant gonorrhoea is real. Ceftriaxone-resistant strains have not yet been identified in South Africa. But the presence of cefixime resistance and the potential emergence of azithromycin resistance are a clear warning.

Investment in better drug prescription practices, diagnostic testing and drug resistance surveillance is crucial to prevent a future epidemic of drug-resistant gonorrhoea.

Abstract
-------
_Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ antimicrobial drug resistance has emerged worldwide; however, the situation in sub-Saharan Africa is not well documented. We investigated the molecular epidemiology and occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in _N. gonorrhoeae_ infections in 2 core transmission groups of men in Johannesburg, South Africa. We recruited men who have sex with men (MSM) presenting with urethral discharge and men with recurrent episodes of urethral discharge. Molecular testing and culture for _N. gonorrhoeae_ were performed, followed by antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was used to identify resistance-conferring mutations and to determine the genetic relatedness of the isolates. In all, 51 men were recruited; 42 (82%) had _N. gonorrhoeae_ infections. Most gonococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (78%) and tetracycline (74%); 33% were penicillin resistant. All gonococcal isolates were susceptible to cephalosporins and spectinomycin. Azithromycin resistance was observed in 4 (15%) isolates (epidemiological cutoff), all with mutations in the mtrR promoter region. Most of the isolates (19/27) harbored the gonococcal genetic island, which is associated with antimicrobial resistance. WGS revealed a diverse epidemic with mostly novel NG-STAR (70%) and NG-MAST (70%) sequence types. Thus, we demonstrate a high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in _N. gonorrhoeae_ strains obtained from high-risk men in South Africa. The introduction of diagnostics and scale-up of surveillance are warranted to prevent the emergence of multidrug-resistant infections.

The investigators report above that 15% of _N. gonorrhoeae_ isolated from 42 high-risk men at public healthcare facilities in Johannesburg, South Africa were resistant to azithromycin; none were resistant to cefixime and ceftriaxone. However, the azithromycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the resistant strains were not given.

Since the introduction of antimicrobial treatment, resistance has rapidly emerged to sulfonamides, penicillins, tetracyclines, macrolides (like azithromycin), fluoroquinolones, and early-generation cephalosporins after each was introduced into therapy for gonococcal infections. Currently, dual antimicrobial therapy with ceftriaxone plus azithromycin is the regimen recommended by the US CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/gonorrhea.htm), to potentially slow the emergence and spread of resistance to cephalosporins and to presumptively treat concomitant chlamydia infection. Monotherapy with azithromycin, 2 g orally as a single dose, has been demonstrated to be 99.2% effective against uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhea; however, monotherapy is not recommended because of documented azithromycin treatment failures and concerns of emerging resistance (https://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/gonorrhea.htm).

Susceptibility testing of _N. gonorrhoeae_ isolates is not routinely performed because most cases are now diagnosed using nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), not culture. Nevertheless, surveillance of the antimicrobial resistance, especially to ceftriaxone and azithromycin, is necessary to monitor emergence and spread of resistance to these drugs. The Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP), a collaborative project between selected STD clinics, 5 regional laboratories, and the CDC, monitors antimicrobial susceptibilities of strains of _N. gonorrhoeae_ in the USA (https://www.cdc.gov/std/gisp/default.htm). Similar programs monitor gonococcal susceptibilities in England and Wales -- Gonococcal Resistance to Antimicrobials Surveillance Program (GRASP), and in the EU -- the European Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme (EURO-GASP). In 2016, the WHO Gonococcal AMR Surveillance Programme (WHO-GASP) received data on AMR in _N. gonorrhoeae_ from 60 countries in 6 regions (https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/topics/topic-details/GHO/who-gonococcal-amr-surveillance-programme-(who-gasp)).

The mechanism of azithromycin's antibacterial action is binding to 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), which blocks protein synthesis. Reduced susceptibility of _N. gonorrhoeae_ to azithromycin, which GISP defines as MICs 2 mcg/mL or greater (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6018a2.htm), is due to multiple mechanisms: modification of the ribosomal target by either rRNA methylase or specific mutations in genes encoding the 23S rRNA and/or an overexpressed efflux pump system. - Mod.ML
