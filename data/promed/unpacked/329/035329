Doctors in Chelyabinsk confirmed botulism in 4 patients from Magnitogorsk
who were admitted into ICU in severe condition at different dates. This
information was communicated from the city Public Health administration.
The head epidemiologist of the administration Dmitriy Zalojkov said that
Chelyabinsk doctors confirmed the diagnosis made in Magnitogorsk.

The source of poisoning is suspected to be prepackaged cheese, which all of
patients had eaten. However, there is no confirmation yet. All patients are
in severe but stable condition. There are no new cases with the same signs
and symptoms.

Yesterday [2 Nov 2009] after a meeting of the physicians, the clinical
diagnosis of 3 of the patients was confirmed. All patients are receiving
treatment but recovery may take months.
