Exposure to the Giant Virus Mimivirus May Promote Arthritis
-----------------------------------------------
Background
----------
The giant [free] DNA viruses, such as the _Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus_, express collagen-like proteins that are similar to animal collagens. Although mimiviruses replicate in amoebae, the authors of this paper show that a 3rd of human beings display a serum IgG response against the main mimivirus capsid protein and that antibodies against a mimivirus collagen were frequent in persons with rheumatoid arthritis. The capacity of mimivirus to elicit antibody responses to endogenous collagen was further demonstrated using a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis. These findings suggest that environmental exposure to mimivirus represents a risk in triggering autoimmunity to collagens.

Abstract
-------
Collagens, the most abundant proteins in animals, also occur in some recently described nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses such as the _Mimiviridae,_ which replicate in amoebae. To clarify the impact of viral collagens on the immune response of animals exposed to Mimiviridae, we have investigated the localization of collagens in _Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus_ particles and the response of mice to immunization with mimivirus particles. Using protein biotinylation, we have 1st shown that viral collagen encoded by open reading frame L71 is present at the surface of mimivirus particles. Exposure to mimivirus collagens elicited the production of anti-collagen antibodies in DBA/1 mice immunized intradermally with mimivirus protein extracts. This antibody response also targeted mouse collagen type II and was accompanied by T-cell reactivity to collagen and joint inflammation, as observed in collagen-induced arthritis following immunization of mice with bovine collagen type II. The broad distribution of nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses in the environment suggests that humans are constantly exposed to such large virus particles. A survey of blood sera from healthy human subjects and from rheumatoid arthritis patients indeed demonstrated that 30 percent of healthy-subject and 36 percent of rheumatoid arthritis sera recognized the major mimivirus capsid protein L425. Moreover, whereas 6 percent of healthy-subject sera recognized the mimivirus collagen protein L71, 22 percent of rheumatoid arthritis sera were positive for mimivirus L71. Accordingly, our study shows that environmental exposure to mimivirus represents a risk factor in triggering autoimmunity to collagens.

[Mimivirus is a viral genus containing a single identified species named _Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus_ (APMV), or is a group of phylogenetically related large viruses. APMV is more commonly referred to as just "mimivirus." Until October 2011, when a larger virus _Megavirus chilensis_ was described, it had the largest capsid diameter of all known viruses. Mimivirus has a large and complex genome compared with most other viruses. Mimivirus, short for "mimicking microbe," is so called to reflect its large size and apparent Gram-staining properties.

APMV was discovered accidentally in 1992 within the amoeba _Acanthamoeba polyphaga_, after which it is named, during research into legionellosis. The virus was observed in a gram stain and mistakenly thought to be a gram-positive bacterium. As a consequence, it was named Bradfordcoccus, after the district the amoeba was sourced from in Bradford, England. In 2003, researchers at the Universite de la Mediterranee in Marseille, France published a paper in Science identifying the microorganism as a virus.

Mimivirus has been placed into a viral family by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [ICTV] as a member of the _Mimiviridae_ and has been placed into Group I of the Baltimore classification system. Although not strictly a method of classification, Mimivirus joins a group of large viruses known as nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV). They are all large viruses which share both molecular characteristics and large genomes. The mimivirus genome also possesses 21 genes encoding homologs to proteins which are seen to be highly conserved in the majority of NCLDVs, and further work suggests that mimivirus is an early divergent of the general NCLDV group.
