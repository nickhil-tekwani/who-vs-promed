Typhoid outbreak hits Harare
----------------------------
Harare City Health director, Dr Prosper Chonzi says the western suburbs of Budiriro, Glen View and Glen Norah have been hit by a typhoid outbreak with over 60 confirmed cases recorded so far. Said Dr Chonzi, "We have witnessed a gradual number of typhoid cases in the western suburbs of Harare, with 61 confirmed cases mainly below the 4 years age group with main drivers being lack of clean water and sewer bursts."

Residents attribute the continual diarrheal outbreaks in Harare to poor service delivery by the councils. Since 2021, the Government has been conducting typhoid vaccination campaigns targeting children between the ages of 9 months to 15 years with the vaccine now incorporated in routine immunization to protect children from the diarrheal disease.

[Typhoid fever, so-called enteric fever, caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, has a different presentation, often without diarrhea, from that of the commoner kinds of salmonellosis.

Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the more commonly seen types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is often reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive. The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity between the louse-borne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas, typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus.

Some strains of the organism have become quite antimicrobial-resistant, particularly ones linked to Pakistan (refer to the See Also section below). Vaccines are available for prevention. - Mod.LL
