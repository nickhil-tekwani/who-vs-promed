Between 8 and 13 Jul 2007, an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis
involving 117 holiday-makers (children and adults) at a campsite in
Romania was investigated by the Constanta District Public Health
Authority (CDPHA). The camp complex has a capacity for 4200 people
and includes 4 canteens.
Outbreak investigation
----------------------
On 8 Jul 2007, the duty officer of the CDPHA was informed that a
large number of children from a campsite for children and
adolescents, situated on the Black Sea Coast, had been referred to
the district hospital presenting with fever, headache, nausea,
vomiting and diarrhea. All those affected initially consulted the
camp doctor, who immediately sent most of them to the local hospital,
for further medical investigation and treatment. The patients were
admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of food poisoning or
enterocolitis, with or without significant dehydration. Most of them
only required parenteral rehydration. All patients reported that they
had eaten at 1 of the site's 4 canteens. The accuracy of the hospital
report was verified by CDPHA.
An outbreak investigation team was set up on 8 Jul 2007, comprising 2
epidemiologists, a food hygiene specialist and an environmental
hygiene specialist. A microbiologist joined the team later in the
investigation. The investigation continued during the outbreak.
Stool samples were taken from patients and canteen personnel,
environmental samples from canteen surfaces, including kitchen and
pastry preparation area, and from food. Most of the guests of the
canteen in question were identified and checked for symptoms. Lists
of children that had spent their holiday in the camp between 6 and 13
Jul 2007 were sent to other public health authorities in the country
to identify the exposed children and keep them under surveillance.
Epidemiological findings
------------------------
Of the 1010 people (946 children and 64 adults) who ate a meal in the
described conditions in the canteen implicated, 117 (11.6 percent)
developed symptoms and sought medical assistance between 8 and 13 Jul
2007. Most of them had fever of more then 38.5 degrees C [101.3
degrees F], as well as headaches, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea,
after having eaten the same meals served on 7 Jul 2007 at the canteen
in question.
The epidemic curve by day and hour of onset is presented in Figure 1
[for figure, see original URL - Mod.LL]. Of 89 cases treated in the
district hospital of Constanta, 14 were not able to pinpoint the hour
of onset precisely and are not included. The time interval between
exposure and onset of symptoms, between 8 and 72 hours as reported by
the cases, was consistent with the incubation periods of _Salmonella_
and enteropathogenic _E. coli_ (EPEC) infections. The age
distribution showed that all age groups among the children were
affected, with the highest morbidity among the 5- to 9-year-olds.
Only one patient was hospitalized for severe dehydration, the other
cases were mild, and all recovered after symptomatic treatment.
During CDPHA inspection of the site, the following risk factors for
the transmission of an infectious pathogen by fecal-oral route were
identified: waste and food were not separated appropriately in any of
the camp's 4 canteens, mainly in the kitchen and pastry preparation
areas; there were insufficient numbers of canteen personnel; and the
canteen in question was overloaded with people (the permitted
capacity is 900 places, but 1010 people had at least 1 meal in this
canteen on 7 Jul 2007).
Laboratory findings
-------------------
Stool samples were taken from 84 of the 89 patients admitted to
hospital in Constanta and from all 15 cases treated in Constanta
district. Of those 99 samples, 34 tested positive for _Salmonella
[enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis, 7 tested positive for
enteropathogenic _E. coli_, and in 6 samples, both _Salmonella_ and
EPEC strains were identified.
All positive samples were sent to the National Reference Laboratory
in the Cantacuzino National Institute for Research and Development in
Microbiology and Immunology for typing and final identification. The
National Reference Laboratory confirmed the results obtained at CDPHA
for all strains of _S._ Enteritidis and 2 strains of EPEC (1 from a
presumed simultaneous infection with Salmonella and EPEC).
Some 18 out of the 27 canteen personnel were tested. Of these, 7
healthy carriers have been detected, 4 of them being _Salmonella_
group D carriers, 1 EPEC (O55) carrier and the other 2 carriers of
_Staphylococcus aureus_. Phage typing for _Salmonella_ strains has
identified _S._ Enteritidis lysotype 1b for all 4, which was
confirmed for the case samples tested in the National Reference Laboratory.
Samples were also taken from raw ingredients and cooked food served
on 7 and 8 Jul 2007, but none of them tested positive for the
suspected etiological agents (_Salmonella_ or EPEC). However,
concentrations of coliform bacteria exceeding the maximum level
permitted by the present Romanian sanitary law for food security and
safety were found in cheese and 2 dishes, 1 with potatoes and meat,
and 1 with pasta and meat. Any of these dishes may, therefore, have
been the source of infection. Furthermore, 30.2 percent of the 43
environmental samples taken from canteen surfaces and the hands of
the staff exceeded the allowed limits (of coliform bacteria),
indicating hygiene infringements in the canteen and among its personnel.
Control measures
----------------
As a result of the epidemiological and laboratory findings, it was
decided to close all 4 canteens. After considering the magnitude of
the outbreak and the results from the testing of environmental
samples, a decision was made to close the entire camp in order to
carry out complete hygienic measures such as thorough cleaning and
disinfection of the functional surfaces, dishes and cooking
equipment. The camp is expected to resume activities within the next 4 weeks.
The CDPHA supervised the communication with local public health
authorities, the case investigation, the tracing of contacts and the
sampling of potential sources of infection and summary reports of the
outbreak were sent to the regional public health institute and to the
Ministry of Public Health.
Conclusions
-----------
The outbreak of gastroenteritis involving 117 cases at the camping
site between 8 and 13 Jul 2007 was caused by 2 etiologic agents --
Salmonella Enteritidis and EPEC. It is thought that poor hygienic
practices of the personnel and overcrowded conditions at the camp
contributed to this outbreak.
The District Public Health Authority investigated the incident and
implemented control measures to limit the outbreak and prevent
further spread. To date, no other cases have been reported by the
public health authorities in Constanta or in other districts.
There are 2 issues related to the outbreak that deserve special
attention. It is compulsory in Romania to keep samples of cooked food
destined to be served in public places for 36 hours, but even though
the samples were taken and stored as required in this case, this
measure did not make any difference to the investigation, as they
were taken immediately after the meal was prepared. As a result of
the canteen being understaffed and overcrowded, the meal was served
in several turns each day and in the meantime the food was improperly
stored at temperatures below 60 degrees C [140 degress F], which
likely allowed the multiplication of bacteria. A case control study
would have helped the investigation but was not performed as it was
thought that food samples would be sufficient to identify the source
of the outbreak.
The 2nd issue raised during the outbreak investigation was related to
the routine check-up of the personnel working in the canteen. By law,
people working in the food industry are obliged to undergo tests for
carrier status of pathogenic bacteria at the start of employment and
then every month. This testing is done by certified laboratories,
either public or private. A quality control of the laboratory
contracted to perform the routine check-ups for the canteen personnel
revealed that the standard operating procedures were not followed
correctly. It is therefore possible that the laboratory tests carried
out at the end of May and June 2007, in which all of the canteen
personnel were shown to be negative, could have been incorrect.
We want to stress the importance of case control studies in
situations such as this outbreak, of setting aside food to be tested
after the meal has been served. These investigations can be used as
an opportunity to train and educate food handlers to prevent such
outbreaks in the future.

[This posting is the formal report of the Romanian summer camp
outbreak initially posted by ProMED in July 2007. Besides the
salmonellosis (now identified as serotype Enteritidis),
enteropathogenic (not enterohemorrhagic) _E. coli_ has also been
found in some cases. A number of hygienic issues were found during
the investigation.
The camp is in Navodari is located in Constanta county in extreme
eastern Romania bordering on the Black Sea. The county can be found
on a map of the country at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constan%C5%A3a_County>. The name of the
town means "trawlers" in Romanian, indicating that it was originally
a fishing village. The camp is mentioned in Wikipedia
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C4%83vodari>): "Some 5 kilometers (3
miles) from the town itself, there is a summer camp (the largest one
in Romania), built under the communist regime for school children.
Due to its interesting programs, good accommodation, and acceptable
prices, it was extremely popular among teachers and parents." - Mod.LL]
