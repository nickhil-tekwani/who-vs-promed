Contaminated Cakes Sicken Romanians
---------------------------------------------------------
Public health investigators are looking into evidence that scores of people
were sickened after eating baked goods contaminated with human feces,
officials said on Wednesday.
Sixty-seven people were hospitalized last week after consuming cream buns
and chocolate eclairs bought from the Opera bakery in the northeast town of
Iasi. Inspectors who subsequently visited the cake shop last Thursday
discovered a box of human feces in the refrigerator.
Some of the sick were receiving hospital treatment for food poisoning while
others have been released, said Dr. Doina Mihalache, of the Iasi Hospital
for Infectious Diseases.
The cake shop, the city's largest, was closed down and the owners were
fined, public health inspector Maria Barhala said. If charged for violating
public health laws, the owners could be sentenced to as much as eight years
in prison.
