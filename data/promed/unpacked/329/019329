Missouri and Indiana: Suspected Cases of Monkeypox
--------------------------------------
Officials in Missouri reported on Sat 14 Jun 2003 what appears to be the
state's first case of monkeypox. In northwest Missouri, the 38-year-old
victim bought a prairie dog from Phil's Pocket Pets, in Villa Park, Illinois,
where a number of other infected prairie dogs were sold, said Mary Menges,
administrator for communicable diseases at Missouri's Department of Health
and Senior Services. "His prairie dog became ill and died; then he became
ill," Menges said. The man's symptoms were typical of monkeypox, she said,
and included fever, body aches, swollen lymph nodes and pustules. The man,
who has not been identified publicly, has agreed to remain isolated in his
home, and "he is doing quite well," Menges said. The man will remain isolated
until his symptoms are gone and the monkeypox scabs have fallen off, which
could take 2-3 weeks, she said. Tissue samples taken from the man have been
sent to the CDC in Atlanta for confirmation, "but on our preliminary test it
was positive," she said.
On Sat 14 Jun 2003, the CDC issued new case numbers for the disease. As of
Saturday morning, before the Missouri case was reported, 79 cases were being
investigated, 17 of them confirmed, said CDC spokeswoman Kathy Harben. They
include: 34 in Wisconsin, 17 in Illinois, 26 in Indiana and 2 in Ohio, she
said.
Monkeypox symptoms include chills and cough, followed by a rash and sometimes
diarrhea, sore throat and mouth sores. Because the symptoms are so common,
monkeypox is easily confused with other illnesses.
About 16 children at a day care center in Adams County, Indiana, as well as
the woman who runs the center, are among suspected cases of monkeypox in that
state, said Dr. Brian Zurcher, a health officer for Adams County. The owner's
daughter has been hospitalized and is "extremely ill," he said. None of the
other children was hospitalized, and all have recovered, he said. The family
that owns the center had bought 2 prairie dogs that had come from the
contaminated group, and used them to entertain and teach the 18 children
enrolled there, he said. He would not identify the center. "About 80 percent
of the children in the day care had some signs or symptoms consistent with
monkeypox," Zurcher said. Specimens from the children have been sent to the
CDC.
The monkeypox outbreak is believed to have begun with a shipment of more than
800 rodents, including 50 Gambian giant pouched rats, from Africa to a
distributor in Texas. The rats are believed to have passed the disease to the
prairie dogs, which were then sold or traded in the Midwest.

Wisconsin: One Prairie Dog Has Played Critical Role in Transmission
----------------------------------------------
Contact with one prairie dog has accounted for more than half of the 34 human
cases of monkeypox in Wisconsin, a state health official said on Fri 13 Jun
2003. The people affected in 18 cases in Wisconsin -- 3 confirmed, 6 probable
and 9 suspected -- were exposed to the prairie dog as it was moved from place
to place, said Dr. Jeffrey P. Davis, the Wisconsin state epidemiologist. "The
prairie dog was moved quite a bit from a pet store to a household to one
veterinary clinic and then to a second veterinary clinic before it died," Dr.
Davis said.
The virus that causes monkeypox is usually transmitted by contact with
lesions on the skin. But federal health officials have recommended that
health care workers use protections against the possibility of airborne
transmission. Wisconsin officials said that in a small number of cases those
who got the virus from an animal did not appear to have had direct contact
with that animal. One Wisconsin resident who apparently caught monkeypox from
the prairie dog had "minimal" contact with the infected animal but slept in
the same room as the caged animal, Dr. Davis said. Also, "a substantial
number of individuals in one particular veterinary clinic became ill as a
result of" direct contact, Dr. Davis said. "We are trying to understand what
that all means, precisely what the contact was. There certainly was a lot of
transmission associated with the movement of this animal from place to place
and with contact with this animal, once the animal was in those settings,"
Dr. Davis said.
Epidemiologists are tracing prairie dogs and other animals that were sold or
traded in the Upper Midwest as part of an investigation into the first ever
outbreak of monkeypox in the Americas. At least 51 additional human
monkeypox cases are under investigation in 3 other states in the
outbreak, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta said.
They include 33 in Indiana, 17 in Illinois and 1 in New Jersey [The New
Jersey Case has been discounted; the patient has chickenpox -- see ref. (08)
below. - Mod.CP].
The number of cases under investigation in Wisconsin rose by 13 yesterday,
partly as a result of the publicity that health officials are seeking in
encouraging people to report any suspected illness. Of the 34 cases under
investigation in Wisconsin, 14 occurred in veterinarians or veterinary
technicians; 8 in exposure to animals in pet stores; 7 in people who had
contact with prairie dogs in a household; 3 who may have had exposure to
prairie dogs in households other than their own; and 2 in health care
workers. Tests are pending on 3 suspected cases in which human-to-human
transmission of monkeypox may have occurred. Dr. Davis said it appeared
unlikely that those cases would turn out to be monkeypox.
Some suspected cases have arisen from people who visited pet stores where
infected animals had been housed. In one case, Dr. Davis said, a customer
visited a pet store for a substantial amount of time to buy a reptile. It is
not clear whether the customer handled an infected animal in the store. In
another case, a customer visited a pet store and did not have any contact
with prairie dogs, but had been scratched by another animal.
