HAFF DISEASE- POSSIBLE MODEL

In North America, the popular sport-fishing fish, the Walleye (_Sander vitreus_) (formerly _Stizostedion vitreum_) suffers from a condition of muscle necrosis that might, if better understood, shed some light on the cause of Haff disease.

Walleye live in fresh water and feed on other fish and largish invertebrates such as crayfish. From time to time walleye are caught by anglers and discovered to have large zones of discoloured, firm and sometimes gritty-textured muscle. Such fish usually are rejected as food by anglers but occasionally are brought to fish and wildlife authorities who in turn sometimes convey them to veterinary diagnostic laboratories or to fish biologists.

Little has been published about this condition, but it has been reported over a broad geographic area that includes western Ontario, the southern prairie zones of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, and in adjacent northern states of the USA.

Histologically, the affected muscle is necrotic (non-living) and undergoing gradual healing through replacement with connective tissue. The necrotic muscle often is quite heavily mineralized. The form presented for examination by anglers is chronic, slowly healing dead muscle and the lesion has been called "myofibrogranuloma" in keeping with a slow inflammatory process directed against a mass of dead muscle. Calling it chronic rhabdomyolysis would be equally appropriate.

Nothing appears to be known about the acute phase of the condition in Walleye or of the range of clinical signs or pathological effects on the fish. No evidence of infectious agents or physical injury has been associated with this condition. A toxic element in the diet is one plausible hypothetical cause, hence the possible parallel with Haff disease.

Perhaps this species could serve as an animal model for Haff disease in people.

[It is an interesting theory. Hopefully someone with research dollars will want to look into this situation with fresh water fish and see if it sheds any mechanistic light on Haff's disease.

The one note of concern is that in people, they all eat the fish. Therefore what do the fish eat to cause this syndrome? Further, has anyone ever looked at the fish associated with Haff disease to see if they have any muscle lesions? - Mod.TG]
