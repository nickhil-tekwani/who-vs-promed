Anthrax case detected in Andhra Pradesh
---------------------------------------
A case of anthrax was detected in Anantapur district [Andhra Pradesh state] on Friday [31 Oct 2014], forcing the district medical and health authorities to conduct an epidemiological survey -- to find out the source of the infection. Anthrax is a bacterial disease transmitted to human beings by animals. It is highly contagious with a high mortality rate. [Contagious? No. - Mod.MHJ]

According to Anantapur district medical and health officer Dr CR Ramasubba Rao, the anthrax case has been detected from Chintapalli, a village bordering the neighbouring state of Karnataka. A class X student contacted the disease and he was admitted in a hospital in Bangalore. The boy was brought to Hindupur government hospital after doctors in Bangalore allegedly refused to provide treatment. The boy is now kept in isolation in Hindupur government hospital. The boy's classmates and his family members are also kept under surveillance as anthrax is a highly contagious disease, Dr Ramasubba Rao said, adding that the condition of the boy is stable.

"We have informed the principal of the government medical college in Anantapur to collect samples from the boy for diagnosis. Clinically, it is anthrax. We are going for further confirmation," he pointed out.

This is the 2nd incident of anthrax from the border areas of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka in the recent past. Since a large number of people move between the 2 states, it is difficult to contain contagious diseases. Officials in Anantapur are now busy to prevent the spread of anthrax in the area.

[It is clear that One Health, WHO, and OIE need to run an anthrax continuing education workshop in India to bring their medical services up to date on this disease and to better improve medical-veterinary interaction.

For years Andhra Pradesh was reporting bovine outbreaks in double digits, but in 2009 it was only 9 outbreaks and in 2012 and 2013 it was single outbreaks. But it is still a problem with sheep and goats, with significant within herd and flock losses.
