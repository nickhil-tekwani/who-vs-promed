Hunter landholders are advised to keep a lookout for bovine ephemeral fever, commonly known as three day sickness, following the 1st case of the season confirmed in the region recently.

Hunter Local Land Services (HLLS) district veterinarians are asking producers to contact them if they have cattle with signs of the disease after a case was detected at a property near Wingham last month [December 2016].

"We would like to test cattle to confirm the disease's distribution as the appearance of the virus is a little different this year [2017]," district veterinarian Dr Lyndell Stone said.

"The virus normally makes its way down the coast with mosquitos in late summer. However, this year [2017], it appeared in the Manning region without being detected elsewhere in NSW.

"This is a little unusual but not unheard of. The virus has been known to overwinter occasionally in the Manning and Hunter areas in the past if conditions are favourable," she said.

"Strategic testing of cattle with signs of the virus supplements our disease surveillance programs and helps provide an early warning to other producers and regions. It also helps the individual affected farmer as many illnesses can mimic the signs of three day sickness.

"At this stage, cases appear to be isolated. Mosquito numbers on the coast are still relatively low, so this may be limiting the number of cases and farms affected," Dr Stone said.

The positive laboratory result, obtained by a private veterinary practitioner in Wingham just before Christmas, confirms suspicions from several farms that three day sickness appears to be circulating in some herds at a low level in the Manning area.

The virus causes a fever, shivering, lameness and joint and muscle stiffness. Cattle can become very sore and stiff and appear lethargic and reluctant to walk. They may drool, have watery eyes and a nasal discharge. They may be unable to stand until the pain and inflammation subsides.

Providing nursing care to affected cattle is crucial to help the animal recover. Food, water and shelter from the hot sun are very important. Anti-inflammatory medication for any down animals can also assist their recovery.

Fortunately, animals infected during last year's [2016] extensive three day sickness season should have immunity to the virus. Previously uninfected yearling stock or cattle new to the coast are most at risk and should be monitored for signs of illness.

Producers can contact their local HLLS district veterinarian on 1300 795 299 or their private veterinarian if they notice signs of three day sickness in their cattle.

["Bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV or BEF) is classified as a member of the genus _Ephemerovirus_ in the family Rhabdoviridae (single-stranded, negative sense RNA). The virus is ether-sensitive and readily inactivated at pH levels below 5 and above 10. Although no evidence of immunogenic diversity is reported, antigenic variation has been demonstrated using panels of monoclonal antibodies and by epitope mapping. Several closely related ephemeroviruses (including Berrimah virus, Kimberley virus, Malakal virus, Adelaide River virus, Obodhiang virus, Puchong virus, kotonkan virus, and Koolpinyah virus) have been identified. However, of these, only kotonkan virus (isolated in Nigeria) has been associated with clinical ephemeral fever in cattle.

BEFV can be transmitted from infected to susceptible cattle by IV inoculation; as little as 0.005 mL of blood collected during the febrile stage is infective. Although the virus has been recovered from several _Culicoides_ species and from Anopheline and Culicine mosquito species collected in the field, the identity of the major vectors has not been proved. Transmission by contact or fomites does not occur. The virus does not appear to persist in recovered cattle, which often have a lifelong immunity.

The prevalence, geographic range, and severity of the disease vary from year to year, and epidemics occur periodically. During epidemics, onset is rapid; many animals are affected within days or 2-3 weeks. Bovine ephemeral fever is most prevalent in the wet season in the tropics and in summer to early autumn in the subtropics or temperate regions (when conditions favor multiplication of biting insects); it disappears abruptly in winter. Virus spread appears to be limited by latitude rather than topography or availability of susceptible hosts. Morbidity may be as high as 80 percent; overall mortality is usually 1-2 percent, although it can be higher in lactating cows, bulls in good condition, and fat steers (10 percent-30 percent). However, reported overall mortality rates have exceeded 10 percent in outbreaks in several countries in recent years.

Signs, which occur suddenly and vary in severity, can include biphasic to polyphasic fever (40-42 C [104-107.6 F]), shivering, inappetence, lacrimation (tearing of the eyes), serous nasal discharge, drooling, increased heart rate, tachypnea (rapid breathing) or dyspnea (difficult breathing), atony of forestomachs (no rumination), depression, stiffness and lameness, and a sudden decrease in milk yield. Clinical signs are generally milder in water buffalo. Affected cattle may become recumbent and paralyzed for 8 hour to more than one week. After recovery, milk production often fails to return to normal levels until the next lactation. Abortion, with total loss of the season's lactation, occurs in approximately 5 percent of cows pregnant for 8-9 months. The virus does not appear to cross the placenta or affect the fertility of the cow. Bulls, heavy cattle, and high-lactating dairy cows are the most severely affected, but spontaneous recovery usually occurs within a few days. More insidious losses may result from decreased muscle mass and lowered fertility in bulls.

Bovine ephemeral fever is an inflammatory disease. The most common lesions include polyserositis affecting pleural, pericardial, and peritoneal surfaces; serofibrinous polysynovitis, polyarthritis, polytendinitis, and cellulitis; and focal necrosis of skeletal muscles. Generalized edema of lymph nodes and lungs, as well as atelectasis, also may be present.

Diagnosis is based almost entirely on clinical signs in an epidemic. All clinical cases have a neutrophilia with the presence of many immature forms, although this is not pathognomonic. Serofibrinous inflammation in the tendon sheaths, fascia, and joints, together with pulmonary lesions, may substantiate a presumptive diagnosis.

Laboratory confirmation is by serology, rarely by virus isolation. Whole blood should be collected from sick and apparently healthy cattle in affected herds and must be sufficient to provide two air-dried blood smears, 5 mL of whole blood in anticoagulant (not EDTA), and approximately10 mL of serum. A differential WBC count on blood smears can either support or refute a presumptive field diagnosis.

Virus is best isolated by inoculation of mosquito (_Aedes albopictus_) cell cultures with defibrinated blood, followed by transfer to baby hamster kidney (BHK-21 or BHK-BSR) or monkey kidney (Vero) cell cultures after 15 days. Suckling mice may also be used for primary isolation by intracerebral inoculation. Isolated viruses are identified by PCR, neutralization tests using specific BEFV antisera, and ELISA using specific monoclonal antibodies. The neutralization test and the blocking ELISA are recommended for antibody detection and give similar results. A 4-fold rise in antibody titer between paired sera collected 2-3 weeks apart confirms infection.

Complete rest is the most effective treatment, and recovering animals should not be stressed or worked because relapse is likely. Anti-inflammatory drugs given early and in repeated doses for 2-3 days are effective. Oral dosing should be avoided unless the swallowing reflex is functional. Signs of hypocalcemia are treated as for milk fever. Antibiotic treatment to control secondary infection and rehydration with isotonic fluids may be warranted.

A vaccine is registered for the prevention of BEF. It is only available through your veterinarian as it is a prescription only product. It is a 2-part vaccine, with freeze dried and liquid components that must be mixed prior to administration. Great care must be taken with this vaccine if the full benefit is to be obtained. Use all reconstituted product immediately. Ultravac BEF Vaccine must be stored between 2 C and 8 C (Refrigerate. Do Not Freeze). Protect from light.

Two injections of the vaccine 2 weeks to 6 months apart under the skin of the neck are necessary for long-lasting protection. Annual boosters are recommended. It is advisable to commence vaccination in the winter months so that cattle are fully immunized prior to summer rains.

The vaccine has provided good levels of protection against BEF. Field observations have shown that some vaccinated cattle can develop mild disease, however the severity and duration of illness is very much less than in unvaccinated cattle.

Treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs has been shown to reduce the course of the disease and calcium injections may aid animals that are down. Most animals will recover if provided with water and shade; however, in extensive management situations, this is often impossible to provide."
