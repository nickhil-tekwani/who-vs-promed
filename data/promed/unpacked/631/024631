A California woman who thought she had COVID-19 turned out to have typhus. The woman of Monrovia, California, said that when she started to experience symptoms of fatigue, fever and headache, she suspected she had COVID-19, according to local news outlet KTLA. But a COVID-19 test came back negative.

However, [the patient] continued to feel sick for weeks. She finally went back to her doctor, who asked if she had recently had any contact with wild animals. She remembered she had disposed of a dead rat in her backyard, KTLA reported. That information eventually led doctors to diagnose her with typhus, a bacterial disease spread by fleas and lice.

One form of typhus, called epidemic typhus, is caused by the bacteria _Rickettsia prowazekii_ and spread by lice, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The disease caused millions of deaths in previous centuries, but it is now rare worldwide; cases are occasionally seen in areas with poor hygiene and extreme overcrowding, CDC says.

But the commonest form of typhus in the US is called murine typhus, which is caused by the bacteria _Rickettsia typhi_ and spread by fleas, according to CDC. Although relatively rare in the US, the disease still pops up in tropical and subtropical climates, including areas of Southern California, Texas, and Hawaii. Indeed, in 2018, an outbreak of fleaborne typhus infected dozens in the Los Angeles area, Live Science previously reported.

[The patient]'s doctors said she likely contracted typhus from infected fleas carried by the rat. When [the patient] posted her story to the social media site Nextdoor, she discovered that another person in her neighborhood had also recently been diagnosed with typhus after disposing of a dead rat, KTLA reported.

Symptoms of murine typhus typically start within 2 weeks of infection, and include fever, chills, body aches, nausea, vomiting and rash. The disease is treatable with the antibiotic doxycycline, according to CDC. Most people completely recover, sometimes even without treatment. People can reduce their risk of murine typhus by avoiding exposure to fleas, for instance by using flea medication for pets and keeping rodents away from their homes.

After her experience, [the patient] advises people not to take a do-it-yourself approach to disposing of dead animals. "If you see something in your yard, call someone who can dispose of it safely and don't try to do it yourself," she told KTLA.

Fleaborne typhus (also known as murine or endemic typhus) is caused by the bacteria _Rickettsia typhi_ and _ Rickettsia felis_. Rats are the primary animal reservoir of _R. typhi_; however, other mammals, such as free-ranging cats, dogs, and opossums, and their fleas, can maintain this microorganism in areas where rats and rat fleas are absent (Azad AF, Radulovic S, Higgins JA, et al. Flea-borne rickettsioses: ecologic considerations. Emerg Infect Dis. 1997; 3(3): 319-27; available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2627639/). Infected humans often have contact with animals that can carry these fleas. Fleas defecate when they feed. Humans become infected when the feces from infected fleas are rubbed into the excoriated bite wound or other wounds in the skin or rubbed into the eyes. These bacteria are not spread from person to person.

A single elevated IgG titer of greater than 1:128 is considered supportive evidence of a rickettsial infection. A 4-fold or greater rise in IgG titers in paired acute/convalescent samples is required to confirm a recent infection (https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/FleaBorneTyphusGuidance.pdf). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of whole blood or serum (prior to antibiotic treatment) is also confirmatory.

In the United States, most cases of murine typhus occur in Texas, California, and Hawaii, with an average of about 300 cases every year, although the disease is not nationally reportable. California averaged 70 reported murine typhus cases annually between 2009 and 2014 and 98 between 2015 and 2017 (https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/FleaBorneTyphusGuidance.pdf). The number of cases spiked in 2018 in California, with 100 confirmed and 64 probable cases of murine typhus, followed by 77 and 64 cases, respectively, in 2019; as of 1 Jul 2020, however, there have been no confirmed and only 15 probable cases, perhaps because murine typhus is being misdiagnosed during the COVID-19 pandemic, as initially in the case reported above and another case in 2020 (https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Flea-borneTyphusCaseCounts.pdf).

Most cases of murine typhus in California occur in Southern California, in Los Angeles County (LAC), (https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Flea-borneTyphusCaseCounts.pdf). The case in the news report above resides in Monrovia, a city of about 39 000 residents, located in the San Gabriel Valley of LAC, California (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monrovia,_California). Previous reports said that the 2018 outbreak in the city of Los Angeles occurred mainly in the downtown area in the homeless community, which had increased 47% since 2012 (see ProMED post Murine typhus - USA (11): (CA) Los Angeles county, more cases, homeless 20181101.6123421 and http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/eprp/Health%20Alerts/LAHAN%20Typhus%2010.4.18%20final.pdf). However, with only 19 cases in downtown Los Angeles, 8 of whom were homeless, over 85% of the 149 murine typhus cases in 2018 of LAC occurred outside of the downtown area and about 95% occurred in non-homeless individuals (https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-ln-typhus-20190217-story.html).

93 and 91 cases were reported, respectively, in 2019 and 2020, and 34 had been reported in 2021 by 5 Aug in LAC, excluding the LAC cities of Pasadena and Long Beach, which each report separately (http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/vectortyphus.htm). The Long Beach Health Department reported that cases more than doubled in 2021, with 10 cases reported so far, compared to a year-to-date average of 4 cases (https://www.longbeach.gov/press-releases/long-beach-reports-increase-in-spread-of-flea-borne-typhus/). No current data was found for Pasadena.
