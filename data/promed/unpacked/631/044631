The Centre for Health Protection today [5 Jul 2012] urged the public to take preventive measures against mosquito-transmitted diseases following a confirmed case of Japanese encephalitis [virus infection] involving a 20 year old woman. She fell ill on 26 Jun [2012] and was admitted to Tuen Mun Hospital's intensive care unit. She is in a serious condition.

The woman lives in Tin Shui Wai and recalls being bitten by a mosquito. She has no recent travel history and her home contacts have no symptoms so far.

The centre has conducted home visits and surveys. Health talks will be held in Tin Shui Community Centre from 6 - 8 Jul [2012].

This is the 1st case reported to the centre this year. There was one case in 2011.

[Tin Shui is an area of Hong Kong, located in Yuen Long District, in the north western part of the New Territories. This is an area of urban development mixed with mostly abandoned fish ponds. There is a wetland and nature reserve to the north. The ponds and wetlands are probably providing the breeding grounds for _Culex_ mosquitoes, the vectors of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). No mention is made about vaccination of the people in the area, since this may be the beginning of the JEV transmission season.

Hong Kong is well within the geographic distribution of JE virus. ProMED-mail archive no. 20040623.1672 indicated that from 1992 to 2003, there have been 7 sporadic cases of JE reported in Hong Kong, including one local case in 1996, one imported case in 1997, one imported case in 2001, 2 imported cases in 2002, and one local case in 2003, 2004 and 2011.
