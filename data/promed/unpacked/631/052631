BSE, EARLIEST RECOGNITION - UK
******************************
A ProMED-mail post
[The following conversation on the recognition of BSE in the UK recently
took place on BSE-L. As a whole it gives a more balanced viewpoint of the
past than that achieved by many journalists. - Mod.MHJ]

One case of a possible previously unrecorded disease that could be due to
normal factors means nothing...
You probably hope to spot a couple more over the next few years so you can
document it, publish it, and have your name put on this new disease...
When you come across a couple more case a few years later, you think your
luck is in, and if the local vet and the farm look good for a paper, you go
and have a close look. You might alert some of you vet friends to keep an
eye out for you.
When you start seeing a clear increase in cases, maybe one every few months,
you begin to wonder if this is an epidemic starting, or a rather more common
disease than you thought. However, PM-ing cattle brains is rarely done,
expensive and hard work, so a relatively not uncommon disease is not that
unlikely.
When you see a case a month, you go and talk to your superior.
This is what happens in real life, and without the benefit of hindsight.
I have probably suffered more than any of you over BSE, yet being rational I
really cannot blame either MAFF, Weybridge or the government. In fact at the
time I thought they were almost certainly over-reacting (and I knew a bit
about TE's even then), possibly seriously over-reacting. A handful of cases,
and panic sets in. This being the case, it would hardly be sense to start
blaming them now.
Remember I was there at the time, involved and aware: most of you were not.

>>>You are absolutely right. This is how science and governments usually
work. It is not fair to imply that vets and civil servants
deliberately covered up the first cases of BSE. But in the case of BSE
this slow reaction was fatal. Furthermore the scientific and governmental
reactions were unnecessarily slow, because there already was the
whole know-how from scrapie.<<<
Utterly correct, there was the comparison with scrapie, which was:
1) It had no economic imortance.
2) It had no human health importance.
3) It had never been seen to spread naturally from the host species. Their
evaluation of the immediate risk (and also mine, I have to say) was that
the risk was low to zero.
What we did NOT know, however, was that infected feed was being fed all
over the country because:
1) Feed mills have steadfastly refused to declare ingredients. So nobody
was aware how the industry had moved from essentially zero inclusion, to
significant inclusion of top quality (feedwise) MBM, particularly in calf
food.
2) That MBM sterilisation techniques were ineffective in destroying the
infective agent for BSE.
>>>Countless transmission experiments had already demonstrated before 1985,
that scrapie and CJD are able to overcome nearly every species barrier by
exchange of tissue.<<<
...These were all by direct injection into the brain. Feed
infection seemed to be very difficult (and is).
>>>Experiments had already shown, that the scrapie agent is able to resist
the process of meat bone meal production.<<<
It was certainly VERY unclear at the time. Almost everyone doubted the
thermostability of prions, experiments notwithstanding. Even today, some do.
>>>Therefore the transmission of scrapie to cattle or the spreading of
occasional cases of spontaneous BSE as well as the transmission of BSE to
man was easily foreseeable.<<<
In hindsight. The hard evidence from scrapie was to the contrary.
>>>I think that this was the motive for the experimental transmission of
scrapie to cattle in the USA years before the first BSE cases in the UK.
The US MAFF only did not publish the "positive" result of the
transmission.<<<
Ok, nobody knew, and the work was not published. Hindsight.
>>>Therefore it is not acceptable that scientists and officials did not
actively screen for BSE and react immediately when the first cases
appeared.<<<
They reacted exactly as the information available to them dictated. They
treated it like scrapie. Correctly given the evidence to hand.
>>>BSE is not only a matter of science, but a first range problem of
health, economics and politics. This was no normal stuff for discussion
with friends and putting into a peer review process. I personally would
have tried to stop the dangerous recycling practice as fast as possible
without waiting for BSE cases.<<<
Hindsight.
>>>The most important question now is, what can we do that something like
this will not happen again and again. Our system failed with AIDS and with
BSE and we are still not prepared to prevent CJD from spreading over the
whole human population.<<<
Paranoia.
>>>In my opinion we need a much faster publishing system and a much more
effective system to find and get information in biology and medicine. We
could easily get such a system by simply adapting it from physics.<<<
Absolutely agreed. Preprints. Still, biologists are always a decade or two
behind he physicists who are generally much smarter. :-)

>>>I also unsucessfully since 1995 asked the German ministers Borchers and
Seehofer to stop the unsafe recycling of abattoir waste with less than
100 degrees celsius. They as well as several German scientists refused to
discuss my warnings with me. But if we get more cases of BSE in Germany,
they doubtless will say that nobody could foresee this.<<<
This is NOT hindsight. By 1995 (1989 in fact) all the relevent information
was available, to an adequate level of certainty. The fact that many
continental govts regarded BSE as a ... trade war, ...
completely blinded them to the realities (on both scores). What responses
they made were inappropriate, ineffective and designed to be easily
avoidable.
Frankly I am amazed that there are not thousands of BSE cases in
continental Europe. Mind you there may well be, it would be very easy to
conceal them, particularly if inspectors fear for their jobs/promotion were
they to identify a case. [NB A German inspector was sacked for this, and
the case went to the European Court in the end].
>>>In my opinion you may not blame the persons although some of them are
guilty. But we should improve our mechanisms to protect us against
amplification of new diseases.<<<
New diseases are:
1) New. Nobody knows their danger and epidemiology.
2) Probably old, but just identified and of no significance or they would
have been seen before.
3) Probably not worth wasting valuable resources on that are better
directed towards known killers. Cancer probably kills more people in a day
than BSE has in 4 years yet the expenditure is quite out of
proportion.
4) Good for paranoic people to get paranoid about.
