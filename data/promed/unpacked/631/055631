The story of the name "CCHF" is even a bit more complicated, and has in fact a strong diplomatic, former Cold War flavor.

"Crimean haemorrhagic fever (CHF)" was first observed and clinically detailed in 200 Russian soldiers, appointed in 1944 by the Russian authorities to harvest crops during wartime in the Crimea, instead of the local peasants. However, due to this unexpected and previously non-scheduled military activity, these soldiers had to sleep outdoors, were thereby heavily bitten by ticks, and suffered shortly afterwards a mostly severe and hemorrhagic feverish condition, thus described for the 1st time as "CHF". In 1945, inoculation in "volunteers" of filtered suspensions of ticks and tissues of these CHF patients proved that CHF was caused indeed by a tick-transmitted virus. Nevertheless, proper isolation of this CHF-virus (CHFV) failed during following years, until it finally succeeded in June 1967 in the lab of the renowned Russian virologist Mikhael Chumakov, from a fatal case, that occurred, however, not in the Crimea, but in Samarkand (nowadays Uzbekistan), far away from the Crimea [1].

However, a then unknown "new" virus, prospectively named V3010, had been isolated already in 1956 by the Belgian infectiologist Dr Ghislaine Courtois from a febrile child in Stanleyville (now Kisangani, [Democratic Republic of the Congo], in the former Belgian Congo). In following decades, evidence for the presence of V3010, later renamed as "Congo virus", was found in Greece, Portugal, South-Africa, Madagascar, the Maghreb, Dubai, Saudi-Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq [2, 3].

In February 1967, Congo virus was sent by these western virologists to Rockefeller Foundation Virus Laboratory (RFVL) in New York, and found to be identical only to another Congo virus strain from Uganda, but not to any other named virus at that time. Chumakov sent his Russian strain only later to RFVL, where it was proved to be entirely identical to Congo virus [4].

The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [ICTV] thus proposed in 1969 the name "Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever virus", but the Russians kept insisting on "Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus". After a long diplomatic standstill, and against all principles of scientific nomenclature based on priority of publication and of virus isolation, this was finally adopted as the official denomination in 1973, in possibly the 1st instance of a virus losing its name to politics and the Cold War.

An appropriate and diplomatic "solution" to this still awkward situation is using preferentially the now prevalent abbreviation "CCHF(V)", where it is left to the beliefs and devotion of the user to interpret which "C" is which. It goes without saying which solution of this little riddle is mostly applied nowadays in ... Belgium.

I joined the East African Virus Research Institute in Entebbe, Uganda in 1965 with a PhD in entomology and virology. The 2 virologists on the staff were backlogged, so the director asked me to dig out some deep-frozen samples of mouse brains containing unidentified viruses that had been sent to us for identification and work them up.

I inoculated V3010, which had been in the Revco at -70 deg C [-94 deg F] for many years, into 2-day-old mice and got the virus (no PPE, mouth pipetting, no masks or gloves in those days!), cross-tested it by HI [hemagglutination inhibition] and CF [complement fixation] against everything in our virus library and it came up negative, so I sent it to Jordi Casals at RF [Rockefeller Foundation] New York, who said it was new. I asked Courtois what he wanted to name it and he said "Congo virus", so that is how I published it.

In 1967 I had moved to be director of the Rockefeller Foundation's Virus Laboratory Belem, Brazil, and hosted 3 young virologists from Chumakov's lab, where they had been trying isolation in weanling mice. They saw that we were isolating a lot of new viruses from mosquitoes, people, and wildlife by inoculating newborn rather than 21-day-old mice, which had been the Rockefeller routine since yellow fever research days. When they got back to their lab in Moscow, they took out their CCHF samples and put them in newborns, and bingo! they got the virus. They then sent their virus to Casals and were chagrined to find that it was identical to Congo virus.

All this is in chapter 3 "Personal reflections" in the Ergonul & Whitehouse book Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, which you [Jan Clement] have obviously read!

[It is interesting to have the complete CCHF history summarized in one place in this ProMED-mail post. ProMED thanks Jan Clement and his colleague for their contribution, and Mod.JW for the account of his historical involvement in the isolation of CCHF virus in Uganda. The debate for using Crimea or Congo first when discussing CCHF virus and the disease persists in many quarters. The good historical news is that there was scientific communication and collaboration going on between Russian and western scientists despite the international cold war tensions at the time.

CCHF remains a public health problem in many parts of the world, with cases reported this year (2015) -- see ProMED posts listed below. Since many viruses know nothing of international boundaries, as amply illustrated by CCHF, international communication and collaboration are still needed. - Mod.TY]
