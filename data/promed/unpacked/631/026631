Connecticut State: First Human Infection with West Nile Virus
--------------------------------------------------------------
HARTFORD: The State of Connecticut Department of Public Health today
announced the first confirmed case of West Nile virus (WNV) infection in a
Connecticut resident. The person is a woman from Norwalk who was tested at
the request of her physician. She experienced only several days of headache
without other specific symptoms and was not hospitalized. Based on the
timing of her headache and the test results, she was most likely exposed to
infected mosquitoes sometime in mid-August. Her infection was confirmed by
testing of 2 blood specimens taken several weeks apart which showed that
she developed increased levels of antibodies to West Nile virus between the
initial and subsequent specimens. Her infection is thought to have been
acquired by exposure to mosquitoes in Norwalk, where she spent considerable
time outdoors without taking specific precautions most evenings.
"The finding of a person from Norwalk who was infected with West Nile virus
in August is not unexpected," said Dr. James Hadler, State Epidemiologist.
"Norwalk had considerable West Nile activity in August and a public health
alert was issued to inform residents of the potential risk." When bitten by
an infected mosquito, most people will easily fight off the infection, and
will only have mild symptoms, such as headache and fever, or none at all.
These people are not infectious, and are not going to develop the disease of
West Nile fever or encephalitis in the future. However, the presence of
antibodies in their blood provides information about the much larger group
of people who were exposed to the virus. It also allows the Department of
Health to find out who is most at risk of being exposed to the virus in the
community and who is most at risk for developing the disease once exposed.
This information will help us understand how to prevent West Nile infection
in the future.
The finding of a person with asymptomatic infection is also not unexpected.
It is believed that 50-300 persons get infected with West Nile virus for
every person who gets a severe infection that requires hospitalization. "In
general, the State looks for consequential infection with West Nile virus,
namely infection that results in hospitalization with encephalitis or
meningitis. Thus far, despite testing of more than 80 persons admitted to
hospitals in Connecticut with encephalitis or meningitis this summer and
fall, we have yet to find a single case due to West Nile virus infection,"
said Dr. Hadler. "The finding of this person with asymptomatic West Nile
virus infection underscores the importance of the seroprevalence survey
recently carried out in Stamford and Greenwich. This survey will help us
determine whether the human infection detected in Norwalk was an isolated or
more common occurrence," said Dr. Hadler.
The survey in Stamford and Greenwich began last Wednesday and was completed
Sunday. At total of 731 people from 646 households had blood drawn to be
tested for West Nile virus infection. The survey is designed to determine
the extent to which people have been truly exposed to the West Nile virus in
areas of Connecticut where the most intense WNV activity was detected. The
blood will be tested for the presence of antibodies to West Nile virus. The
State will continue to investigate all suspicious cases. Thus far, there
have been 17 other confirmed West Nile virus infections in the United States
this year, all in persons from New York City or nearby New Jersey, and all
in persons who were hospitalized.
