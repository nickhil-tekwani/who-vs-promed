About 130 cows grazing on a Texas ranch became infected with a deadly
virus carried only by wildebeests [aka gnus - Mod.JW] but not harmful
to humans, agricultural officials said Friday [18 Apr 2007].

The wildebeests, native to Africa, were on an undisclosed private
Texas ranch that holds various wild animals.

Although the wildebeests' fate is not known, the cattle they infected
will be destroyed and their owners compensated, U.S. Department of
Agriculture officials said.

The Texas cattle -- 134 breeding heifers -- were recently sold and
shipped to Illinois, Arkansas, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana,
Mississippi and parts of Texas, where 2 of them died.

One died on a Louisiana farm, which was put under temporary
quarantine, Louisiana State Veterinarian Henry Moreau said. He said
he did not think Louisiana cattle were in any danger.

On Thursday [17 Apr 2008], test results from the National Veterinary
Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa confirmed that the cows were
diagnosed with wildebeest-associated malignant catarrhal fever (MCF).

Officials stressed that the virus is not a contagious disease in
cattle and poses no threat to people. "We don't want people getting
nervous about this," said Bryan Black, a spokesman for the Texas
Department of Agriculture. "It is not a human health threat whatsoever."

Wildebeests carry the virus, which can become airborne.

Animal health investigators speculate that although the cattle and
wildebeests were in separate pastures, they might have gathered near
an adjoining fence line, Black said.

[Because MCF, especially the wildebeest-associated form, is considered
a foreign animal disease in the USA, it is likely that the herd that
was shipped will have animal health regulators doing many traces to
locate those exposed animals and any others that may have been
exposed. Certainly, producers should be on the alert and promptly
report illnesses to veterinarians.

AHV-1 in adult wildebeest, hartebeest, and topi is mainly
cell-associated. The cell-associated form is rarely transmitted to
other animals; however, cell-free virus can be isolated from the
nasal secretions of adult wildebeests after the animals are stressed
or given corticosteroids. Neonatal wildebeests can spread the
infection more readily. Wildebeest calves can be infected in utero
and shed the virus in nasal and ocular secretions and in the feces.
Free-living calves are all infected by the time they are 6 months
old. Cell-free AHV-1 can be transmitted to cattle and other
susceptible animals by inhalation in aerosol droplets, ingestion of
contaminated feed or water, or possibly mechanical transmission by
arthropods. This virus is quickly inactivated by sunlight.

OHV-2 has not been isolated as an intact virion, and its means of
transmission is not known. OHV-2 is often spread by neonatal lambs,
but all ages can be infectious. Fairly close contact between
susceptible animals and sheep, especially lambing ewes, is thought to
be necessary. The role of goats in spreading OVH-2 is unknown.

Ruminants that develop malignant catarrhal fever appear to be dead-end
hosts. Cases of cattle-to-cattle transmission have been documented,
but this seems to be rare.
