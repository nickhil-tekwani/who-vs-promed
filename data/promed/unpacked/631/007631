A case of seasonal reassortant A(H1N2) influenza virus infection was detected in the routine sentinel surveillance for influenza-like illness and other acute respiratory infections in The Netherlands. The virus genome consists of 6 gene segments of a seasonal influenza A(H3N2) virus (PB1, PB2, PA, NP, NA, M) and 2 gene segments of a seasonal A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (HA, NS).

A general practitioner (GP) was consulted for a child aged 1 year and 7 months with influenza-like illness on [5 Mar 2018]. He had acute onset of illness on [2 Mar 2018] characterized by fever, malaise, sore throat, coughing, shortness of breath, rhinorrhea and diarrhea. No travel abroad was reported. The patient was not vaccinated against influenza, did not use influenza antivirals or any other medication, and had no underlying disease.

The specific GP participated in the sentinel influenza surveillance network. After obtaining permission from the parent accompanying the child, a nose and throat swab were collected for virus detection. Using real-time RT-PCR and MinION nanopore sequencing on [18 Mar 2018] it was confirmed that the patient was infected by a seasonal reassortant A(H1N2) influenza virus. The GP was consulted again on [8 Mar 2018] for the patient having otitis media for which antibiotics were prescribed, after which the patient fully recovered. Contact investigation revealed that the parents had symptoms of (predominantly) gastrointestinal infection in the 2 weeks preceding onset of disease in the index case. Extended contact investigation at the day care center attended by the child before disease onset, did not reveal any actual disease.

Enhanced laboratory monitoring and subsequent typing of influenza samples in the city where the index lives have been put in place. As the reassortant virus genome contains a mixture of genes from currently circulating seasonal influenza viruses, no increase in virulence is expected. No mutations in the genome were observed which alter sensitivity to antiviral treatment. The genome sequence of A/Netherlands/10407/2018 was released in the GISAID EpiFlu database (Isolate_Id EPI_ISL_304183).

Reassortant A(H1N2) seasonal influenza viruses have been found before (reviewed in Komadina, et al. Emerg Infect Dis. 2014 Jan;20(1):6-12). Spreading of these viruses generally was limited, but in one instance continued for 3 seasons with a reassortant of former seasonal A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) influenza virus. A reassortant of A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) has only been described once before in India. In the Netherlands, the 2017-2018 influenza season is dominated by influenza B/Yamagata lineage viruses but the Dutch National Influenza Center characterized around 600 influenza type A viruses, only one of which (the case reported here) was of the H1N2 subtype. There is thus no evidence for extensive spreading of the A(H1N2) virus, but laboratories should remain on alert.

re: on GISRS Discussion Forum and Information Exchange

As discussed and agreed with the International Health Regulations regional contact point for the WHO regional office for Europe the naming of the reassortant virus that will be used in further communication is "seasonal reassortant A(H1N2) influenza virus" further explained as consisting of HA and NS genes of human seasonal A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza virus and M, NA, NP, PA, PB1 and PB2 genes of human seasonal A(H3N2) influenza virus.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Meijer for his important contribution on the newly identified re-assortant "seasonal reassortant A(H1N2) influenza virus" (influenza A/H1Pdm09 virus) during the current influenza season.

Novel influenza viruses can arise among humans either by direct transmission from mammalian or avian sources or through genetic reassortment. The segmented nature of the influenza viral genome allows reassortment to occur in a host that is simultaneously infected with more than 2 subtypes of influenza A viruses. Although influenza viruses exhibit some host specificity, swine are susceptible to infection with viruses of avian and mammalian lineages, facilitated by the presence of receptors for both lineages in the respiratory tract. Swine can therefore serve as "mixing vessels" for different lineages, providing an opportunity for novel reassortants to arise. The reassortant viruses may acquire mammalian adaption characteristics, thereby allowing infection of humans to occur [1].

A(H1N2) viruses have been described among avian, swine, and human populations. Like A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) viruses, A(H1N2) viruses have become established in swine herds in many regions. In contrast, A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 were the only type A viruses documented as circulating among humans as of 2009. Reassortant A(H1N2) seasonal influenza viruses have been reported previously [2].

Direct cross-species transfer of swine A(H1N2) is rare and until recently was restricted to reports of single cases from the Philippines (2004) [3] and from Michigan and Minnesota in 2007 and 2011, respectively [4], and most recently from Brazil in 2017 [5]. Reassortant A(H1pdm09N2) has been detected only once in an isolated case in India [6]. Overall for the 2017-2018 influenza season in the Netherlands around 600 influenza type A viruses have been H and N subtyped, only one of which (the case reported here) was of the H1pdm09N2 subtype [GISRS Discussion Forum and Information Exchange].

The rise of H1N2 re-assortants containing genes from the H1N1pdm09 virus is a serious concern as the H1N1 Pdm09 virus is quite adapted to human-to-human transmission and presents an ideal background for spread of novel strains. There is thus no evidence for extensive spreading of the A(H1pdm09N2) influenza virus, but laboratories should remain on alert.
