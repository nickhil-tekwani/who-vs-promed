Use of a Reduced (4-Dose) Vaccine Schedule for Postexposure
-----------------------------------------------------------
Prophylaxis to Prevent Human Rabies - Recommendations of the Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices: This report summarizes new
recommendation and updates previous recommendations of the Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for postexposure
prophylaxis (PEP) to prevent human rabies. Previously, ACIP
recommended a 5-dose rabies vaccination regimen with human diploid
cell vaccine (HDCV) or purified chick embryo cell vaccine (PCECV).
These new recommendations reduce the number of vaccine doses to 4.

The ACIP recommendations for the use of rabies immune globulin (RIG)
remain unchanged. For persons who previously received a complete
vaccination series (pre- or postexposure prophylaxis) with a
cell-culture vaccine or who previously had a documented adequate
rabies virus-neutralizing antibody titer following vaccination with
noncell-culture vaccine, the recommendation for a 2-dose PEP
vaccination series has not changed.

Similarly, the number of doses recommended for persons with altered
immunocompetence has not changed; for such persons, PEP should
continue to comprise a 5-dose vaccination regimen with 1 dose of RIG.
Recommendations for preexposure prophylaxis also remain unchanged,
with 3 doses of vaccine administered on days 0, 7, and 21 or 28.
Prompt rabies PEP combining wound care, infiltration of RIG into and
around the wound, and multiple doses of rabies cell culture vaccine
continue to be highly effective in preventing human rabies.

This report summarizes new recommendation and updates previous
recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
(ACIP) for postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) to prevent human rabies
(CDC. Human rabies prevention---United States, 2008: recommendations
of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. MMWR 2008;57[No.
RR-3]). Previously, ACIP recommended a 5-dose rabies vaccination
regimen with human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV) or purified chick
embryo cell vaccine (PCECV). These new recommendations reduce the
number of vaccine doses to 4. The reduction in doses recommended for
PEP was based in part on evidence from rabies virus pathogenesis
data, experimental animal work, clinical studies, and epidemiologic
surveillance.

The following are some extracts from the document.
--------------------------------------------------
"Prompt wound care and the administration of rabies immune globulin
(RIG) and vaccine are highly effective in preventing human rabies
following exposure. A variety of empirical schedules and vaccine
doses have been recommended over time, based in part on
immunogenicity and clinical experience in areas of the world with
enzootic canine or wildlife rabies. As more potent vaccines were
developed, the number of vaccine doses recommended for PEP has
decreased, and studies aimed at further revision and reduction of PEP
schedules and doses in humans have been encouraged. By the latter
half of the 20th century, a 4- to 6-dose, intramuscular regimen using
human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV) or purified chick embryo cell
vaccine (PCECV) was being recommended.

"In the United States, a 5-dose PEP vaccine regimen was adopted
during the 1980s. In 2007, when human rabies vaccine was in limited
supply, an ad hoc National Rabies Working Group was formed to
reassess the recommendations for rabies prevention and control in
humans and other animals. In 2008, a smaller Advisory Committee on
Immunization practices (ACIP) Rabies Workgroup was formed to review
rabies vaccine regimen options. This report provides updated ACIP
recommendations regarding the use of a 4-dose vaccination regimen,
replacing the previously recommended 5-dose regimen, for rabies PEP
in previously unvaccinated persons.

"This reassessment of post-exposure vaccination protocol has been
based partly on data received some form of PEP (usually without RIG)
after substantial delays, or were administered PEP according to
schedules that deviated substantially from current ACIP or World
Health Organization recommendations (information which is tabulated
in the report). For example, In India an analysis from 2 animal bite
centers during 2001--2002 demonstrated that in 192 human rabies
cases, all deaths could be attributed to failure to seek timely and
appropriate PEP, and none of them could be attributed to a failure to
receive the 5th (day 28) vaccine dose.

"The ACIP Rabies Working Group estimates that >1000 persons in the
United States receive rabies prophylaxis annually of only 3 or 4
doses, with no resulting documented cases of human rabies, even
though >30 percent of these persons likely have exposure to confirmed
rabid animals. In addition, no case of human rabies in the United
States has been reported in which failure of PEP was attributable to
receiving less than the 5-dose vaccine course. Worldwide, although
human PEP failures have been reported very rarely, even in cases in
which intervention appeared both prompt and appropriate, no cases
have been attributed to the lack of receipt of the 5th human rabies
vaccine dose on day 28.

"Compared with older, nerve tissue-based products, adverse reactions
associated with modern human rabies vaccination are uncommon. A
review by the Workgroup of published and unpublished human rabies
vaccine clinical trials and Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System
data identified no adverse events that were correlated to a failure
to receive the 5th vaccine dose. As some adverse reactions might be
independent clinical events with each vaccine administration, the
omission of the vaccine dose on day 28 might have some positive
health benefits. Otherwise, the overall safety of human rabies PEP is
expected to be unchanged from the evidence provided in the 2008 ACIP report."

The document should be read in full not least to obtain the benefit
of the excellent schematic (figure 1) that summarizes the dynamics of
rabies virus pathogenesis in the presence and absence of postexposure
prophylaxis (PEP)-mediated immune responses.
