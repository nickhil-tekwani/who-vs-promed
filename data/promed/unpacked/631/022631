Planthopper and virus infections declining in central Thailand
--------------------------------------------------------------
Brown planthoppers (BPH) and 2 virus diseases they transmit, rice grassy
stunt (RGSV) and rice ragged stunt (RRSV), started infecting large areas in
central Thailand in July 2009. Both insects and diseases spread to all the
provinces, and several of them suffered huge losses. We are now beginning
to see the infections declining in some provinces. In June [2010] about 25
000 ha [about 62 000 acres] [were affected by] outbreaks, compared [with]
379 000 ha [937 000 acres] in December 2009.

Although large areas in Suphan Buri, Sing Buri, and Kamphaeng Phet were
still heavily infected with the virus diseases, damaged areas in other
provinces were very low [sparse] in June 2010. One reason for the decline
was water shortage, which prevented many farmers from growing the last
crop. This had created a "break" in the outbreak cycles.

Over the period from July 2009 to June 2010, about 3.1 million ha [7.7
million acres] of rice were seriously damaged and about 1.1 million tons of
paddy lost due to attacks of BPH and virus diseases. The government
provided to farmers USD 22 million in pesticide subsidies, USD 28 million
to delay planting, and USD 3.3 million to change varieties. The BPH in
2009/2010 had cost Thailand about USD 275 million loss in export revenues.
The livelihoods of thousands of farmers were threatened.

In 2008 and 2009, farmers, in response to high rice prices, planted rice
intensively with only 10 days break between crops. This had resulted in
staggered planting and continuous presence of rice with intense use of
fertilizers and pesticides. There was extremely low genetic diversity with
75 per cent of the area planted to 2 varieties.

The Rice Department will be developing more sustainable ways to manage
planthopper outbreaks. Many of the rice areas in Central Thailand would
still remain vulnerable as insecticide misuse continues. Farmers begin to
use new varieties, but this change would be slow. Depending on rice prices,
farmers might return to intensive cropping.

[_Rice ragged stunt virus_ (RRSV; genus _Oryzavirus_) has been reported to
cause yield losses of up to 90 per cent in several Asian countries.
Symptoms include ragged appearance of plants, twisted leaves, vein
swelling, unfilled grains, and severe stunting of plants. Its only way of
spread is vector transmission by brown planthoppers (BPH; _Nilaparvata
lugens_). The insects transmit the virus in a persistent manner and remain
infectious for life. Infected hoppers can be transported on air currents to
spread the virus quickly over long distances.

_Rice grassy stunt virus_ (RGSV; genus _Tenuivirus_) has been reported to
cause serious damage in limited areas during sporadic outbreaks of its
vector. It is spreading in large parts of the rice-growing areas of Asia.
RGSV is also transmitted exclusively by vectors (_N. lugens_, _N. bakeri_,
and _N. muiri_) in the same way. Symptoms include severe stunting,
excessive tillering ('grassy' appearance), erect growth habit, leaf spots,
and reduced pale leaves. Infected plants usually survive until maturity,
but produce no panicles.

High vector populations are often associated with outbreaks of these
viruses. Disease management for both viruses includes cultural practices
(such as short term draining of rice fields, crop rotation, or rice-free
periods), vector control, and use of cultivars with reduced sensitivity or
resistance to the virus, the vector, or both. Cultivars resistant to the
vector have low disease incidence, but insect adaptation overcoming hopper
resistance has been a problem. The application of insecticides to migratory
planthoppers is being used in some areas to reduce disease incidence.

_N. lugens_ is one of the worst pests of rice in the Australasian and
Pacific Island region. In addition to being a virus vector, it causes
yellowing, browning, and drying of plants ('hopper burn') and leaves small
injuries exposing the plant to fungal and bacterial infections.
