More than 100 children have now died in an outbreak of suspected encephalitis in India's Bihar state, officials say. At least 200 patients, many of whom are below the age of 10, are still being treated at 2 hospitals. State officials have said that many victims had died due to hypoglycaemia, or low blood sugar.

Thousands of children have died of encephalitis in Bihar and neighbouring Uttar Pradesh since the 1st case was detected in the late 1970s.

The state has announced that it will bear the cost of treatment for all those affected. The Indian government has said that it will "extend all possible support" to the state and affected families.

The outbreak since the beginning of June [2019] has seen the most deaths in the city of Muzaffarpur.

The disease usually occurs during the monsoon season, and children are the worst affected. Until 2005, doctors say that the majority of deaths were caused by Japanese encephalitis, a mosquito-borne virus. But in the past decade or so, children have been dying of other forms of viral encephalitis, the exact cause of which is unclear.

The disease causes headaches and vomiting and can lead to coma, brain dysfunction, seizure, and inflammation of the heart and kidney. Doctors say children between the age of 6 months and 15 years are the worst affected, and 1/5 of the children who survive have to live with neurological weaknesses.

"It is difficult to say with certainty if children are dying due to encephalitis, because there could be a number of reasons behind these deaths," Dr Mala Kaneria told BBC Hindi's Priyanka Dubey. "It could also be due to malnutrition, insufficient levels of sugar and sodium, or electrolyte imbalances."

Dr Kaneria added that some of these deaths could also be caused by eating lychees on an empty stomach. Lychees contain toxins that inhibit the body's ability to produce glucose, which could affect young children whose blood sugar levels were already low because they were not eating dinner.

[The number of cases of AES in the area continues to grow. A 19 Jun 2019 report indicates that the death toll has increased to 114 with more than 500 cases of AES registered since the outbreak began 1 Jun 2019, according to a government health bulletin released Wednesday [19 Jun 2019]. The outbreak has been exacerbated by a heatwave, with temperatures in Patna, Bihar's capital, reaching a high of 45.8 deg C / 114.5 deg F (https://federalnewsnetwork.com/health-news/2019/06/death-toll-rises-in-eastern-india-in-encephalitis-outbreak/). As noted in comments on early posts, although lychee fruit consumption by malnourished children is the main suspected etiology of AES in recent reports, apparently some scientists in India think that a virus, probably Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), is responsible for some of the cases. As noted previously, some cases of AES are frequently attributed to Japanese encephalitis, but many are of undefined etiology. The determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 most common agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue.

It has been proposed previously that consumption of lychees is responsible for some encephalitis cases. Encephalopathy and hypoglycemia have been associated with consumption of lychee fruit containing phytotoxins, specifically alpha-(methylenecyclopropyl)glycine (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150201.3132842). However, Dr Jacob John has asserted that many of these are hypoglycemic Reye syndrome cases. He noted that in the pre-monsoon period, particularly in May and June, outbreaks of Reye-like acute hypoglycemic encephalopathy occur in the northwestern region of Bihar state, and that is also popularly, but unfortunately, called AES. Many doctors, the media, and the public consider these encephalopathy cases as encephalitis because of the term AES. This has been now clarified, and in June 2014, children were treated by 10% dextrose infusion and many lives were saved [dextrose administration is not mentioned in the above report]. Other etiologies have been proposed by clinicians. A published article in a pediatric journal proposed that some cases are due to heat stroke. A 16 Jun 2019 report stated that the Bihar state health department in a press release said maximum deaths have occurred this year due to hypoglycemia resulting from high heat, humidity, and no rain (http://en.rfi.fr/asia-pacific/20190616-heatwave-encephalitis-deaths-skyrocket-bihar-northern-india). In that press release, no mention is made of lychee consumption or virus infections.

Until the etiology (or etiologies) of these AES cases is determined, effective and efficient prevention of these cases will not be possible. The presence of enterovirus had earlier been confirmed in the cerebrospinal fluid of one of the patients when it was tested at the virology lab attached to the Government Medical College, Alappuzha (https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/enterovirus-led-to-encephalitis-in-malappuram/article27957202.ece). Enterovirus infections have been attributed before as etiological agents of AES, but laboratory confirmations are scarce. - Mod.TY
