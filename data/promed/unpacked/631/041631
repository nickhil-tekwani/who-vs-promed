I am the scientist working on the recent outbreak of bonamiosis in New
Zealand. At the end of the ProMED-mail release regarding this disease,
there is a paragraph on its taxonomy and distribution that is erroneous.
There are two known species of _Bonamia_. In the Northern Hemisphere,
_Bonamia ostreae_ has been reported from European oysters (_Ostrea edulis_)
on the east coast of the United States (US) (Maine). It was then introduced
onto the west coast of the US (California) by movements of _O. edulis_
from the east coast.
In the late 1970s it was moved to Europe in Californian _O. edulis_
introduced into France. It subsequently devastated the oyster industries of
several Atlantic and Mediterranean European countries.
Another, undescribed, species of _Bonamia_ caused massive epizootics in
oysters (_Ostrea chilensis_) in southern New Zealand from 1986, causing the
closing down of the industry. An apparently identical _Bonamia_ caused
epizootics in oysters (_Ostrea angasi_) in Port Phillip Bay, Victoria,
Australia, in 1991, and it is now known to occur along the coast of
southern Australia and Tasmania. _Bonamia_ has recently been reported from
_O. chilensis_ in Chile, but its identity is unclear.
Ultrastructurally, _Bonamia_ belongs to the _Haplosporidia_ (Alveolata),
and sequencing of the 18S region of the rDNA gene supports that placement.
_Bonamia_ spp. are obligate parasites of oyster hemocytes, and like other
protozoans that utilize phagocytes, it is able to evade hemocytes killing
mechanisms, including the respiratory burst, and phagosome-lysosome fusion.
Results of the survey we are currently carrying out will be available in
two weeks time.
