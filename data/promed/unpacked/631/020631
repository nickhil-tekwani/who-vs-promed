Arizona: 2 Cases of Hantavirus Infection Confirmed in Maricopa County
--------------------------------------------------
Maricopa County health officials on Wed 8 Jan 2003 confirmed 2 recent cases
of hantavirus infection and are urging the public to take precautions
around rodent-infested areas. Health department officials learned of the
cases, which are unrelated, in mid-December 2002 after the victims were
hospitalized. Investigators determined that one man contracted the rare and
sometimes fatal pulmonary disease in the county, and they are still trying
to figure out where the other victim was exposed to the virus. Officials
will not disclose the victims' identities, areas of residence, or details
of their illnesses to maintain their privacy, health department spokesman
Doug Hauth said.
Hantavirus was first identified in the Southwest in 1993. Since then 37
cases have been reported in Arizona. 9 people have died. Maricopa County
has reported 6 cases, none fatal. "They were all identified early enough
and given supportive care and pulled through," Hauth said.
A news producer and photojournalist with Channel 5 (KPHO) in Phoenix was
one of those who survived. He contracted hantavirus in 2002 and believes he
was exposed to the virus in Texas after the disease killed his mother and
sister [see part (2) of the ProMED-mail post entitled "Hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome update 2002 - USA (03) 20020809.5011". - Mod.CP]. "Beyond the
physical stuff, the emotional stuff has really taken its toll," he said on
Wednesday. However, his recovery has been relatively quick. He has returned
to work and exercising. "Usually, it takes people years," he said. "What
saved me was information and early treatment. If you wind up going into an
emergency room with flu-like or pneumonia-like symptoms, you need to be
adamant with health care officials (that you've been exposed)," he said.
Hantavirus is an airborne virus spawned from certain rodent droppings,
saliva, and excretions. It can affect humans who inhale the virus, but it
cannot spread from person to person.The virus is found more often in places
where mice can breed, including rural areas, construction locations, and
areas with debris. Roof rats do not carry the disease. [Initially virus
infection] mimics symptoms of the common cold or flu, and may rapidly
progress to respiratory failure when the lungs fill with fluid. Patients
usually develop breathing difficulty 2 to 6 days after onset of symptoms,
and victims typically end up in the intensive-care unit. There is no
specific treatment or cure.

[Although not stated, it is probable from the location that the hantavirus
responsible for both these cases is _Sin Nombre virus_, whose reservoir
host is the deer mouse _Peromyscus maniculatus_. - Mod.CP]
