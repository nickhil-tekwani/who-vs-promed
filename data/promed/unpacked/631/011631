Russian district bars Chinese following cholera outbreak
Authorities in the Primorye region of Russia's Far East have barred
admission to Chinese citizens until the origins of a recent cholera
outbreak can be determined, the Russian news agency Itar-Tass reported on
Tuesday.
Two men returning from China to Primorye Territory fell ill with the
disease. As a result, local officials have barred admission to Chinese
citizens for 5 days and placed "tighter medical control"
on foreigners living in the area and on Russians returning from China.
Primorye's governor called a special meeting of the commission for
emergencies to discuss the incident.
A local press report said there had been a severe cholera outbreak on the
Chinese side of the border recently.
Interfax news agency, which also reported the incident, said the border
restrictions were "unprecedented" .
"One border checkpoint is fully closed and unprecedented restrictions have
been imposed at the remaining four.
"This decision was made on Tuesday at an emergency session of the
territory's emergencies commission following the detection of cholera
spreading from China to Primorye," Interfax reported.
