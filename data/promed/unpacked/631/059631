[This report provides updated case and fatality numbers that underscore the Nigeria minister of health's statement that Lassa fever is a significant and growing public health problem in several states, indicating that additional support that will be given to the health care centers will provide for additional patient care (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160123.3959273).

However, prevention and control of Lassa fever depend on control of the rodent reservoir, the multimammate mouse (_Mastomys_ spp.), which occurs across Nigeria and beyond. Reduction of populations of this rodent will require active participation at the village level. That will necessitate mounting a public education program with support of rodent control technicians.

Images of mastomys mice can be seen at http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877.
