Camel bites have been implicated in the deaths of 2 young girls in Darfur's East Jebel Marra, according to a Radio Dabanga report. It is reported that the 12 and 17-year-old girls were bitten and crushed by the animals. This has prompted concern in the area about rabid animals. It is believed that the camels contracted the deadly virus from the bite of a rabid dog.

[It is not clear whether the 2 victims were killed by the crushing and bites of camel(s) and died within short time after the tragic incident. In such a case, the diagnosis "rabies" is rather unlikely. Rabies becomes a diagnosis to be considered if clinical signs were observed, and they died between a week and 6 months after their alleged exposure. Information from professional sources confirming (or otherwise) rabies is requested. In case confirmed, it will be interesting to note how long after exposure the victims died and whether rabies was lab confirmed in humans and/or in animals.

Rabies is an infectious viral disease affecting all warm-blooded animals and humans. Clinical signs of dromedary camel rabies have been reported in 1993 by Afzal and colleagues. (Vet Rec. 1993; 133(9): 220). They included hyper-excitability, attacking inanimate objects, self-biting of forelimbs, salivation, sternal recumbency, paralysis of hind legs, and death within 3-7 days. There have been more recent descriptions of rabies in camels in at least 2 provinces in Sudan. According to one of them (ref. 1) from North Kordofan State, 2001, as many as 19 camels were reportedly affected. This large number was attributed to several factors, the most prominent being "the madness of the offender dog, animals close contact with each other and the site of the bites (upper and lower lips)." Another, later (2005) description from Sudan is available at http://sudanjvr.net/10-21.html.

In Israel, about one per cent of lab-confirmed rabies cases in animals during the period 1948 to 1997 were seen in dromedary camels (ref. 2).

Though camels, as other herbivores, are not regarded as vectors but rather as dead-end victims of rabies, their notorious tendency to bite may play a role in the increased exposure of herd-mates and humans to infection.
