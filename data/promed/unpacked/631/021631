[Donetsk is a city located in the eastern Ukraine. Many residents of the
Donetsk and the surrounding region are immigrants from Russia or descended
from such immigrants. Donetsk lies 95 km north of the sea of Azov, a
popular vacation spot for the residents of the city. - ProMED-mail Russian
correspondent.
The details are too sketchy to hazard a guess as to the etiology, viral or
not. Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP]
