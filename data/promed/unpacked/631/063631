Mumps in Canada, 2007
---------------------
As of Wed 5 Mar 2008, 1284 confirmed cases of mumps have been reported in
2007 from 10 out of 13 Canadian provinces and territories [see table below
and an accompanying figure in the original text - Mod.CP]. Confirmed cases
are either laboratory-confirmed or clinically compatible and linked to a
laboratory-confirmed case. There have been ongoing outbreaks centered in
the Maritime provinces and in the province of Alberta. In addition, several
other provinces experienced increased mumps activity in 2007.

Table. Geographical and sex distribution of confirmed mumps cases reported
in Canada. Onset 31 Dec 2006-29 Dec 2007 (n=1284):
Province/territory / case count / percentage male
Nova Scotia / 777 / 49
Alberta / 258 / 58
New Brunswick / 124 / 57
Ontario / 48 / 33
British Columbia / 25 / 44
Quebec / 20 / 55
Prince Edward Island / 13 / 73
Newfoundland Labrador / 10 / 40

Northwest Territories / 0 / 0
Yukon Territory / 0 / 0
National Total / 1284 / 51

It is assumed that most people born before 1970 (about 40 years old) are
immune to mumps, as they were likely naturally exposed to the mumps virus
in the period before immunization significantly reduced the amount of mumps
virus that was circulating. Most people born between 1990 and 1994 (12 and
17 years old depending on the province/territory of residence) were offered
2 doses of mumps-containing vaccine due to the introduction of a 2nd dose
of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine for measles control in 1996-97 in
most provinces and territories. This has left a susceptible cohort of
people born between 1970 through 1990 (to a lesser extent through 1994) who
were only eligible for one dose of mumps-containing vaccine and who are not
assumed to have natural immunity. It is important to note that the age at
which natural immunity to mumps can be assumed is not known with certainty
and that some individuals born prior to 1970 may still be susceptible to mumps.

[The interested reader should consult the original text for a more detailed
graphic presentation of these data. - Mod.CP]

The majority of cases (58 per cent) reported in 2007 were aged 20-29 years
[data illustrated graphically in the original text]. For those cases where
information was reported (n=594), 50 per cent were post-secondary students.
The reason for the particular susceptibility among those who are college
and university-aged is multifactorial. They are too young for natural
immunity and too old for routine 2-dose MMR immunization. Mumps has a
fairly long infectious period (up to 16 days), a long incubation period (14
to 25 days), and up to 20 per cent of infectious cases show no signs or
symptoms. In addition, the very social and mobile lifestyles of this age
group appear to be facilitating disease transmission and interfering with
control measures. This age group tends not to adhere to isolation requests,
and they generally do not participate when immunization is offered.
Furthermore, post-secondary students often share living/sleeping
arrangements, many are involved in competitive sports, they frequent
bars/pubs/nightclubs and travel during school holidays and breaks.
Additional cases in this demographic group and possibly other jurisdictions
would not be unexpected.

Of those mumps cases reported in 2007 with known immunization history
(n=586), 8 per cent (45) had received 2 or more doses, 73 per cent (430)
had received one dose and 19 per cent (111) received no doses of
mumps-containing vaccine.

The data on mumps hospitalizations and complications are incomplete.
Complications have been reported in about 8 per cent of cases in 2007.
There have been reports of orchitis (76), oophoritis (9), hearing loss (8),
mastitis (3), meningitis (1), encephalitis (1), pancreatitis (1) and
nephritis (1). Less than 2 per cent of cases have resulted in hospital
emergency department visits, overnight observation or hospital admission.

Immunization
------------
Mumps remains endemic in many countries throughout the world. Mumps vaccine
is used in only 57 per cent of World Health Organization member countries,
predominantly in countries with more developed economies. The Public Health
Agency of Canada encourages parents, guardians and adults to maintain
up-to-date immunizations for themselves and their children.

The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) provides the Public
Health Agency of Canada with ongoing and timely medical, scientific, and
public health advice relating to immunization. NACI released their updated
recommendations for mumps-containing vaccine in August 2007. They recommend
2 doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine for infants and
children. In addition, they recommend a 2nd dose of MMR vaccine for certain
high-risk adults born in or after 1970 who have not received 2 doses of the
vaccine and are possibly susceptible to the mumps virus. This includes
students in secondary and post-secondary institutions and health-care
workers. All NACI guidelines can be accessed on the Public Health Agency of
Canada's website <http://www.naci.gc.ca>.

Individual provinces and territories implement immunization programs within
their respective jurisdictions according to local need and decision
processes. The 2004 National Immunization Coverage Survey (NICS) found that
94 per cent of Canadian children had received a single dose of the MMR
vaccine by their 2nd birthday. Coverage estimates for the 2nd dose of MMR
vaccine by 7 years of age was 79 per cent. Other results from the 2004
National Immunization Coverage Survey can be found in the Canadian National
Report on Immunization. The recent outbreaks and increases in mumps cases
across Canada have led to targeted immunization activities in several
provinces and territories. [This information is presented comprehensively
in tabulated form in the original text, which should be consulted by the
interested reader].

On 11 Dec 2007, Health Canada advised provincial and territorial health
authorities not to use 3 lots of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine while the
Department investigated 6 suspected cases of anaphylaxis in Alberta
patients. All anaphylactic events were associated with the same lot number
and involved young adults who had a previous history of allergy. All the
individuals recovered upon treatment. The vaccinations took place during a
catch-up campaign for young adults in response to a mumps outbreak. The
review found no link between the vaccine lot and the adverse events in
Alberta. The suspensions have been lifted, and the lots are available for
use by provinces and territories to vaccinate adults and children <http://
www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/advisories-avis/_2008/2008_35_e.html>.

Laboratory testing and viral strain
-----------------------------------
The clinical and laboratory diagnosis of mumps can be difficult. Proper
specimen collection and transportation along with appropriate laboratory
testing and cautious interpretation of results are important. In 2007, the
Public Health Agency of Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory revised
their laboratory guidelines for the diagnosis of mumps. The guidelines are
available on the Public Health Agency of Canada's website
<http://www.nmllnm.gc.ca/english/mumps.htm>.

Identifying virus strains is useful for differentiating vaccine and
wild-type strains, linking cases, linking outbreaks, tracking importations,
and documenting the elimination of a particular strain from a geographic
area. The viral strain in the 2 2007 Canadian outbreaks (Maritimes and
Alberta) is identical to the genotype G strain detected from the 2005-2006
Nova Scotia outbreaks, the United States' multistate outbreak in 2006 and
the United Kingdom epidemic (2004-2006). In the United States' outbreak,
there were over 2500 cases reported in at least 13 states. It involved
several university and college campuses, and the median age was 21 years.
In the United Kingdom, the epidemic peaked at more than 50 000
notifications, with the majority being 15-24 years old.

The G genotype is not unusual or rare and, like the rest of known genotypes
of mumps, it has been circulating globally for decades or longer. There are
multiple strains of mumps virus, and there is evidence that the immunity
induced by one mumps virus strain protects against infection by other
strains (10). However, there is also some evidence suggesting that the
immune response directed against one genotype of mumps may not provide
absolute protection against infection with mumps viruses of other genotypes
(11,12). Mumps virus detection, isolation and genotyping are available at
the National Microbiology Laboratory.

Public health actions
---------------------
Mumps cases are asked to self-isolate for a period of 9 days following the
onset of symptoms. The vaccine status of close contacts (that is, household
and intimate contacts/exchange of saliva) is assessed and updated so that
they receive 2 doses of MMR vaccine. Guidelines have been put in place for
health care workers who are cases or who are contacts of mumps cases.

Public health and primary care providers are encouraged to refer to their
local or provincial/territorial ministry of health for specific
recommendations on action that may be required within their jurisdiction.

All provinces and territories are being kept informed of the epidemiologic
situation and the public health management strategies in the affected
jurisdictions. Based on this, all jurisdictions are encouraged to continue
monitoring mumps activity within their regions and report any changes
and/or cases to the Public Health Agency of Canada, particularly in
provinces and territories not currently affected by the on-going outbreaks.

The Public Health Agency of Canada along with the provinces and territories
is developing national guidelines for mumps outbreak prevention and
control. This group is drawing on the experiences and expertise both here
in Canada and other countries.

Several provinces, territories and post-secondary institutions are
encouraging students to ensure their immunization is up-to-date (readers
should refer to specific provincial/territorial public health authorities
and educational institutions).

The Public Health Agency of Canada will continue to provide updates on the
current outbreak of mumps. The agency is working with the affected
provinces in monitoring this outbreak, providing technical advice and
assisting with laboratory testing of clinical specimens at the National
Microbiology Laboratory. The Public Health Agency of Canada supports the
provincial outbreak response strategies that include the recommended
isolation of cases and targeted immunization of contacts and susceptible
cohorts.

The Public Health Agency of Canada recommends that jurisdictions
experiencing outbreaks should consider offering an additional dose of MMR
vaccine for immunization in outbreak settings. Some jurisdictions are
encouraging and/or offering MMR vaccine to healthcare workers and
post-secondary students. In other jurisdictions, there are ongoing
discussions regarding an expanded immunization strategy to target the
susceptible cohort. Readers should refer to their local or
provincial/territorial ministry of health for specific recommendations.

The Public Health Agency of Canada encourages parents, guardians and adults
to maintain up-to-date immunizations for themselves and their children and
encourages susceptible individuals to be immunized in accordance with the
National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) guidelines. All
guidelines can be accessed at <http://www.naci.gc.ca>.

NACI currently recommends a 2nd dose of MMR vaccine for certain adults born
after 1970. This includes students at post secondary institutions and
health care workers.

[The preceding report gives a comprehensive account of the mumps outbreaks
which affected 10 of the 13 Canadian provinces in 2007. The analysis is
applicable to mumps outbreaks elsewhere.

The report also concludes that several adverse anaphylactic reactions
encountered in a catch-up programme in Alberta were not mediated by a
particular vaccine lot, which had been withdrawn temporarily. The suspect
vaccine lot has been released for general use. - Mod.CP]
