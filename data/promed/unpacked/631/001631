Canadian public health officials said as many as 12 deaths may be linked to
an outbreak of food poisoning, an increase from 4 yesterday [24 Aug 2008],
and the number of cases may rise. Eleven of the fatalities from listeriosis
occurred in Ontario and one was in British Columbia, Mark Raizenne,
director-general for the Public Health Agency of Canada, said today [25 Aug
2008] at a news conference in Ottawa. The fatalities are among 26 cases of
the disease from the same strain of listeria that was identified at a
Toronto plant run by Maple Leaf Foods Inc.

The company, Canada's largest food processor, expanded a food recall
yesterday [24 Aug 2008] to include all meat products made at the Toronto
plant, which is scheduled to reopen tomorrow [26 Aug 2008]. Of the deaths
in Ontario, listeriosis was listed as the cause or an underlying factor in
6 fatalities, with the other 5 under investigation to determine the extent
to which the disease was a factor, Raizenne said. "We fully expect that the
numbers of suspected and confirmed cases will increase as this
investigation continues and samples continue to be tested," Canadian
agriculture minister Gerry Ritz said at the news conference.

Health officials are also investigating an additional 29 suspected cases to
determine whether they are connected to the strain discovered at the Maple
Leaf plant. Maple Leaf temporarily closed its Bartor Road plant in Toronto
last week [week of 18 Aug 2008] after a number of Sure Slice delicatessen
meats tested positive for listeria, a type of bacteria that can lead to
fevers, severe headaches, and nausea. Listeriosis is the disease caused by
the bacteria.

A change in practice to include fatalities where listeriosis may not have
been the direct cause contributed to the sharp increase in the death toll,
health officials said.

Maple Leaf fell CAD 1 [USD 0.96], or 10 per cent, to CAD 8.80 [USD 8.42] at
4:10 pm on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the biggest one-day decline since 22
Feb 2006. The shares have dropped 18 per cent since 19 Aug 2008, the day
before the Toronto-based company expanded a recall of some of its meat
products.

Ontario officials said today [25 Aug 2008] in a statement it asked health
authorities to "check their local hospitals, long term care homes, and
daycares to ensure than any products from the Toronto Maple Leaf plant have
been removed and are not been being consumed." Maple Leaf reiterated today
that the recall will cost about CAD 20 million (USD 19.1 million) and said
its 1st priority is to restore consumers' confidence in its products. "The
short-term financial impact of this action is secondary to our
responsibility to safeguard our consumers' health," chief financial officer
Michael Vels said today in a conference call. The recall involves more than
200 meat products that were made as early as January [2008], Vels said. The
products represent a "small percentage" of the company's annual sales,
which were CAD 5.21 billion [USD 4.99 million] last year [2007]. Vels
declined to speculate on how the recall will affect future Maple Leaf revenue.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency said today [25 Aug 2008] that
sandwiches made by Lucerne Foods, a unit of Safeway Inc, are being recalled
because some of them may contain Maple Leaf meats. The Safeway and
TakeAwayCafe brand sandwiches were distributed in Saskatchewan and Alberta.

Maple Leaf placed advertisements today [25 Aug 2008] in Canadian newspapers
committing to put consumers' interests first. "This is the toughest
situation we've faced in 100 years as a company," chief executive officer
Michael McCain said in the ad. "We know this has shaken your confidence in us."

Undoubtedly more cases will be added as additional genetic testing of
listeria isolates is done. The incriminated products have been recalled
last week, but people may continue to be exposed to product inadvertently
remaining on selves as they may have best-before dates ranging from 30 Sep
2008 to 1 Jan 2009. - Mod.ML]
