[1] Lambda variant
Date: Fri 30 Jul 2021

Owing to rapid mutations, the continual emergence of several SARS-CoV-2 variants [has] been reported, among which some are regarded to be variants of concern (VOC), for example, alpha, beta, and delta. Other variants are known as variants of interests (VOI), for example, eta, kappa, lambda, and iota. As a result, researchers keep an eye on the prevalence of these variants since they may pose a global threat.

Multiple mutations are present in the spike (S) protein of VOCs and VOIs, and these variants have been reported to be resistant to the neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) elicited after vaccination or after natural COVID-19 infection.

Since the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2's S protein is immunodominant, a mutation in this site causes immune evasion. Also, mutations in the N-terminal domain (NTD) aid viruses in escaping neutralization. Therefore, to date, all the vaccines that received emergency use authorization (EUA) from various regulatory bodies are targeted towards the spike protein.

[Not] all mutations disrupt the effectiveness of the vaccine-induced immune responses. For example, previous research has shown HV69-70 deletion does not have any effect on the sensitivity of neutralizing antibodies' sensitivity, [but] it increases viral infectivity.

Similarly, deletion of the LAL242-244 in the beta variant does not affect the sensitivity to the vaccine-induced neutralization. However, it has shown little resistance to NTD-targeting neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, these studies reveal that all mutations do not necessarily have negative effects on the efficacy of vaccines.

The lambda variant belongs to the C.37 lineage, which has been newly designated as a VOI on 14 Jun 2021 by WHO. This variant is predominantly spreading in South American countries that include Chile, Peru, Argentina, and Ecuador. According to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database, the lambda variant has been reported in 26 countries worldwide.

The rate of vaccination has been notably high in Chile. A recent study conducted in Chile has shown that around 60% of the population have received at least a single dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Recently, during the spring of 2021, a rapid surge in COVID-19 cases was observed in Chile. This is because the lambda variant is capable of escaping the immune responses induced via vaccination.

A new study published on the bioRxiv preprint server used molecular phylogenetic analysis to study the evolutionary trait of the lambda variant. In this study, the researchers have revealed that insertion of RSYLTPGD246-253N mutation in the NTD of the lambda S protein is associated with the increased virulence. This mutation is responsible for the rapid spread of the lambda variant in the Southern American countries. The authors of this study have indicated 2 of the critical virological features of the lambda variant, namely, (a) resistance to viral-induced immune responses due to the RSYLTPGD246-253N, L452Q, and F490S mutations and (b) enhancement in the rate of transmission due to the T76I and L452Q mutations. This study revealed that the lambda S is more resistant to the vaccine-induced antisera compared to the lambda+N246-253RSYLTPGD S derivative.

Another important aspect of this is that RSYLTPGD246-253N mutation overlaps with a component of the NTD "supersite" indicating that it is the immunodominant site. Hence, mutation of this site has enabled the lambda variant to escape immune responses elicited by the COVID-19 vaccine. The comparative study between the parental D614G S strain and the lambda variant has shown significantly higher infectivity in the latter viral strain.

The findings of this study are in line with previous studies that had revealed that higher infectivity of the lambda, delta and epsilon variants is due to the L452Q/R mutation. Scientists have explained that only increased viral infectivity does not attribute to a large-scale infection. Such an instance was observed for the epsilon variant, where even after possessing high infectivity, it failed to spread in the human population. Thereby, WHO excluded it from the VOC/VOI classification on 6 Jul 2021. In order to understand if a variant would infect a large number of people, it is essential to determine 2 characteristic virological features of the variant -- that is, increased viral infectivity and evasion from the immune response. This study revealed that the lambda variant possesses both these virological features.

This study has elucidated the evolutionary trend of the lambda variant using molecular phylogenetic analyses and virological experiments. Even though the lambda variant has been classified as VOI, the authors of the present study have highlighted the potential of this variant to cause an epidemic in the future.

Summary
------
"SARS-CoV-2 lambda, a new variant of interest, is now spreading in some South American countries; however, its virological features and evolutionary trait remain unknown. Here we reveal that the spike protein of the lambda variant is more infectious and it is attributed to the T76I and L452Q mutations. The RSYLTPGD246-253N mutation, a unique 7-amino-acid deletion mutation in the N-terminal domain of the lambda spike protein, is responsible for evasion from neutralizing antibodies. Since the lambda variant has dominantly spread according to the increasing frequency of the isolates harboring the RSYLTPGD246-253N mutation, our data suggest that the insertion of the RSYLTPGD246-253N mutation is closely associated with the massive infection spread of the lambda variant in South America."

Highlights
----------
- "Lambda S is highly infectious and T76I and L452Q are responsible for this property.
- Lambda S is more susceptible to an infection-enhancing antibody.
- RSYLTPGD246-253N, L452Q and F490S confer resistance to antiviral immunity."

But it is the delta variant that is the driver of the pandemic at this time, making it a more important variant to watch. While lambda is more infectious than alpha, it is not more infectious than delta, which has been reported by CDC to be as transmissible as chickenpox, regardless of vaccination status, and may cause more severe disease than all other known versions of the virus. - Mod.LK]

[2] Delta variant
Date: Fri 30 Jul 2021

Cases and deaths resulting from COVID-19 continue to climb worldwide, mostly fuelled by the highly transmissible delta variant, which has spread to 132 countries, said the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) on Friday [30 Jul 2021]. Almost 4 million cases worldwide were reported last week to WHO and the agency expects the total number of cases to pass 200 million in the next 2 weeks. "And we know this is an underestimate", underscored director-general Tedros Adhanom Gebreyesus during his regular COVID-19 briefing.

Infections have increased in every region of the world, with some even reaching 80% more in the past month. In Africa, deaths have increased by 80% over the same period, the official warned. Tedros blamed the rise of cases on increased social mixing and mobility, the inconsistent use of public health and social measures, and inequitable vaccine use. He said "hard-won gains" are in jeopardy or being lost, and health systems in many countries are increasingly overwhelmed. "WHO has warned that the COVID-19 virus has been changing since it was first reported, and it continues to change. So far, 4 variants of concern have emerged, and there will be more as long as the virus continues to spread", he said.

Lead WHO epidemiologist and COVID-19 technical lead, Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, explained that the delta variant has certain mutations that allow the virus to adhere to human cells more easily and that experts are also seeing a higher viral load in individuals infected. She called delta "dangerous and the most transmissible SARS-CoV-2 virus to date. There are some laboratory studies that suggest that there's increase replication in some of the modelled human airway systems", she added.

In terms of severity, Dr Van Kerkhove highlighted that there has been an increase in hospitalizations in certain countries affected by the variant, "but we haven't yet seen an increase in mortality".

The WHO expert reminded that although there [are] some data that suggest that people vaccinated can get infected and transmit the variant, the likelihood is much reduced after the 2nd dose has been administered and reached full effectiveness. She also clarified that delta is not specifically targeting children as some reports have suggested, but warned that as long as the variants are circulating, they will infect anybody that is not taking proper precautions. "It's in the virus's interests to evolve, viruses are not alive they don't have a brain to think through this, but they become more fit the more they circulate, so the virus will likely become even more transmissible because this is what viruses do, they evolve they change overtime", Dr Van Kerkhove warned, echoing Tedros' remarks. "We have to do what we can to drive it down", she added, reminding that public health and social measures do work against the delta variant, and that the vaccines do prevent disease and death.

Dr Michael Ryan, executive director of WHO Health Emergencies, said that even with the virus getting "faster and fitter" the gameplan does not change, but it needs to be implemented more efficiently. "Delta is a warning that this virus is evolving, but it is also a call to action before more dangerous variants emerge", he said.

Last month [June 2021], the WHO chief announced the setting up of a technology transfer hub for mRNA vaccines in South Africa as part of WHO's efforts to scale up production of vaccines and their distribution in Africa. "Today we have taken another step forward, with a letter of intent that sets out the terms of collaboration signed by the partners in the hub: WHO; the Medicines Patent Pool; Afrigen Biologics; the Biologicals and Vaccines Institute of Southern Africa; the South African Medical Research Council and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention", Tedros explained.

He added that WHO's goal remains to aid every country in vaccinating at least 10% of its population by the end of September [2021], at least 40% by the end of this year, and 70% by the middle of next year [2022]. "We are a long way off achieving those targets. So far, just over half of countries have fully vaccinated 10% of their population, less than a quarter of countries have vaccinated 40%, and only 3 countries have vaccinated 70%", Tedros warned.

The WHO head reminded that the global distribution of vaccines remains unjust, despite expert warnings and appeals, and said that all regions remain at risk, "none more so, than Africa. On current trends, nearly 70% of African countries will not reach the 10% vaccination target by the end of September [2021]", he cautioned. Tedros also announced that on response to the delta surge, the WHO's Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator is launching the Rapid ACT-Accelerator Delta Response, or RADAR, and issuing an urgent call for USD 7.7 billion for tests, treatments and vaccines.

[3] CDC: variants
[A] Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR)
Date: Fri 30 Jul 2021
Source: CDC [edited]
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7031e2.htm


Summary
------
What is already known about this topic?
Variants of SARS-CoV-2 continue to emerge. The B.1.617.2 (delta) variant is highly transmissible.

What is added by this report?
In July 2021, following multiple large public events in a Barnstable County, Massachusetts town, 469 COVID-19 cases were identified among Massachusetts residents who had traveled to the town during 3-17 Jul 2021; 346 (74%) occurred in fully vaccinated persons. Testing identified the delta variant in 90% of specimens from 133 patients. Cycle threshold values were similar among specimens from patients who were fully vaccinated and those who were not.

What are the implications for public health practice?
Jurisdictions might consider expanded prevention strategies, including universal masking in indoor public settings, particularly for large public gatherings that include travelers from many areas with differing levels of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Discussion
----------
The SARS-CoV-2 delta variant is highly transmissible, and understanding determinants of transmission, including human behavior and vaccine effectiveness, is critical to developing prevention strategies. Multipronged prevention strategies are needed to reduce COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality.

The findings in this report are subject to at least 4 limitations. First, data from this report are insufficient to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, including the delta variant, during this outbreak. As population-level vaccination coverage increases, vaccinated persons are likely to represent a larger proportion of COVID-19 cases. Second, asymptomatic breakthrough infections might be underrepresented because of detection bias. Third, demographics of cases likely reflect those of attendees at the public gatherings, as events were marketed to adult male participants; further study is underway to identify other population characteristics among cases, such as additional demographic characteristics and underlying health conditions including immunocompromising conditions. Massachusetts (MA) DPH, CDC, and affected jurisdictions are collaborating in this response; MA DPH is conducting additional case investigations, obtaining samples for genomic sequencing, and linking case information with laboratory data and vaccination history. Finally, Ct values obtained with SARS-CoV-2 qualitative RT-PCR diagnostic tests might provide a crude correlation to the amount of virus present in a sample and can also be affected by factors other than viral load. Although the assay used in this investigation was not validated to provide quantitative results, there was no significant difference between the Ct values of samples collected from breakthrough cases and the other cases. This might mean that the viral load of vaccinated and unvaccinated persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 is also similar. However, microbiological studies are required to confirm these findings.

Event organizers and local health jurisdictions should continually assess the need for additional measures, including limiting capacity at gatherings or event postponement, based on current rates of COVID-19 transmission, population vaccination coverage, and other factors. On 27 Jul 2021, CDC released recommendations that all persons, including those who are fully vaccinated, should wear masks in indoor public settings in areas where COVID-19 transmission is high or substantial. Findings from this investigation suggest that even jurisdictions without substantial or high COVID-19 transmission might consider expanding prevention strategies, including masking in indoor public settings regardless of vaccination status, given the potential risk of infection during attendance at large public gatherings that include travelers from many areas with differing levels of transmission.

[B] Statement from CDC director Rochelle P Walensky
Date: Fri 30 Jul 2021
Source: CDC media statement [edited]
https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0730-mmwr-covid-19.html


On 27 Jul 2021, CDC updated its guidance for fully vaccinated people, recommending that everyone wear a mask in indoor public settings in areas of substantial and high transmission, regardless of vaccination status. This decision was made with the data and science available to CDC at the time, including a valuable public health partnership resulting in rapid receipt and review of unpublished data.

Today, some of those data were published in CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), demonstrating that delta infection resulted in similarly high SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in vaccinated and unvaccinated people. High viral loads suggest an increased risk of transmission and raised concern that, unlike with other variants, vaccinated people infected with delta can transmit the virus. This finding is concerning and was a pivotal discovery leading to CDC's updated mask recommendation. The masking recommendation was updated to ensure the vaccinated public would not unknowingly transmit virus to others, including their unvaccinated or immunocompromised loved ones.

This outbreak investigation and the published report were a collaboration between the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Department of Public Health and CDC. I am grateful to the commonwealth for their collaboration and rigorous investigation. I would also like to humbly thank the residents of Barnstable County who leaned in to assist with the investigation through their swift participation in interviews by contact tracers, willingness to provide samples for testing, and adherence to safety protocols following notification of exposure.

This outbreak investigation is one of many CDC has been involved in across the country and data from those investigations will be rapidly shared with the public when available. The agency works every day to use the best available science and data to quickly and transparently inform the American public about threats to health.

[C] Pivotal discovery

A new study shows the delta COVID-19 variant produced similar amounts of virus in vaccinated and unvaccinated people if they get infected -- illustrating a key motivation behind the federal guidance that now recommends most fully vaccinated Americans wear masks indoors. Experts say that vaccination makes it less likely that you'll catch COVID-19 in the first place -- but for those who do, these data suggest they could have a similar tendency to spread it as unvaccinated folks.

"High viral loads suggest an increased risk of transmission and raised concern that, unlike with other variants, vaccinated people infected with delta can transmit the virus," Dr Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said in a statement Friday [30 Jul 2021].

The study, published by CDC [on] Friday [30 Jun 2021], describes 469 Massachusetts residents who were infected in a July outbreak in Barnstable County, which includes the summer vacation destination Provincetown. No deaths were reported among them https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7031e2.htm?s_cid=mm7031e2_w. About 74% -- or 346 cases -- had been fully vaccinated. Of those cases, 79% reported symptoms. Genetically sequenced cases revealed the delta variant as the main culprit.

The researchers found evidence that viral loads were similar among 127 fully vaccinated people and 84 others who were unvaccinated, partially vaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown. Viral load is a proxy for how likely someone might be to transmit the virus to others.

On Tuesday [27 Jul 2021], Walensky previewed these findings while unveiling guidance that people in areas with "high" or "substantial" COVID-19 transmission should resume wearing masks indoors. Over 75% of the US population live in these areas.The finding that the delta variant resulted in similar viral loads "was a pivotal discovery leading to CDC's updated mask recommendation," Walensky said [on] Friday. "The masking recommendation was updated to ensure the vaccinated public would not unknowingly transmit virus to others, including their unvaccinated or immunocompromised loved ones."

Prior to delta, vaccination was known to impact factors that likely influence transmission. Not only did vaccinated people tend to have lower viral loads, but they also had milder symptoms and were sick for less time. But research has shown that delta spreads more aggressively. Earlier this month [July 2021], for example, Chinese scientists described viral loads that were about roughly 1000 times higher with delta than earlier strains.

On Thursday [29 Jul 2021], a CDC internal document said the delta variant was roughly as transmissible as chickenpox, whereas an early strain was closer to the common cold. This means that, under certain conditions, an infected person may have transmitted to 2 or 3 people, on average, early in the outbreak. But now, with delta, that number could be 5-9. "It's one of the most transmissible viruses we know about. Measles, chickenpox, this -- they're all up there," Walensky told CNN late [on] Thursday.

The CDC document also cited reports indicating the variant might cause more severe disease, as well. But even with similar viral loads, it's not a foregone conclusion that vaccinated people are necessarily as contagious as unvaccinated people.

"This is intriguing data, it's important, but I'm not positive that you're equally as infectious if you're vaccinated," said Dr Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease specialist at University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved in the research. Gandhi said there are multiple parts to the immune system -- including antibodies and T cells -- that raise important questions around using viral load, which is measured by PCR tests, as a proxy for how contagious someone is.

The new report says that "microbiological studies are required to confirm these findings" of similar viral loads among breakthrough infections. It also notes that "asymptomatic breakthrough infections might be underrepresented" because they are less likely to be detected.

Earlier this week, Walensky said that ongoing outbreak investigations will help uncover more about what happens when these breakthrough infections do occur. "We are now continuing to follow those clusters to understand the impact of forward transmission of those vaccinated people," she said. "But again, I want to reiterate, we believe the vast majority of transmission is occurring in unvaccinated people and through unvaccinated people."

Even with delta, COVID-19 vaccines still reduce the spread of the virus. Moreover, vaccinated people are far less likely to end up in the hospital. The CDC internal document estimated that vaccines reduce the risk of severe disease or death 10-fold or greater, and they reduce the risk of infection 3-fold. "Getting vaccinated continues to prevent severe illness, hospitalization and death -- even with delta," Walensky said this week.

Among the Massachusetts residents in the latest study, none died and only 5 were hospitalized. Of those 5, one person was unvaccinated and had underlying medical conditions, and 4 were vaccinated. Among the vaccinated group, one had received the Pfizer vaccine, and the remaining 3 had received Johnson & Johnson. The vaccinated individuals ranged in age from 20 to 70, and 2 had underlying health conditions.

Additional infections were identified among visitors from at least 22 other states who visited the area from 3-17 Jul 2021. Thousands gathered for summer festivities, and infected people reported going to "densely packed indoor and outdoor events at venues that included bars, restaurants, guest houses, and rental homes," the study says.

Although these findings motivated CDC to update its guidance for areas with higher levels of viral transmission, the study notes that Barnstable County was not one of those areas until the outbreak. Between 3-17 Jul 2021, daily new cases rose from a 14-day average of 0 to 177 cases per 100 000 residents.

The study suggests that "even jurisdictions without substantial or high COVID-19 transmission might consider expanding prevention strategies, including masking in indoor public settings regardless of vaccination status." "The measures we need to get this under control -- they're extreme. The measures you need are extreme," Walensky told CNN late [on] Thursday [29 Jul 2021].

The study also notes that breakthrough infections are expected, especially as the slice of the population that's vaccinated grows larger. "As population-level vaccination coverage increases, vaccinated persons are likely to represent a larger proportion of COVID-19 cases," the authors wrote.

CNN previously reported on the outbreak connected to Provincetown. In total, at least 882 cases have been linked to the cluster so far, about 60% of whom were Massachusetts residents, according to local officials. The town manager of Provincetown, Alex Morse, told CNN [on] Friday [30 Jul 2021] that the town appeared to be taking a favorable turn -- with an indoor mask mandate in place and a test positivity rate that's on the decline. "We think we're heading in the right direction, but obviously concerned about what's happened here in the last few weeks," Morse told CNN's John Berman.

A source familiar with the CDC's decision to update its recommendations previously told CNN that, in addition to the viral load findings, the overall prevalence of delta and lower-than-hoped vaccine uptake played key roles in the latest iteration of the guidance.

As Kerala reported more than 22 000 fresh COVID-19 cases for the 3rd day running, neighbouring Karnataka and Tamil Nadu too recorded a spike in new infections on Thursday [29 Jul 2021], taking India's daily case count to nearly 45 000, the highest in 22 days. India recorded 44 681 COVID-19 cases on Thursday [29 Jul 2021], the highest daily count since 7 Jul 2021. Apart from the southern states, Maharashtra too reported a slight spike in infections, with 7242 new cases registered on Thursday, the highest in a week.

Kerala logged 22 064 fresh cases on Thursday [29 Jul 2021]. While the state had accounted for more than 50% of India's new cases in the past 2 days, its share on Thursday dropped slightly below the halfway mark.

Karnataka's case count crossed 2000 after 19 days. The state logged 2052, up sharply from 1531 on the previous day. Daily cases, as well as positivity rates, have risen in districts bordering Kerala as well as in Bengaluru, prompting the Karnataka government to declare the Dakshina Kannada district as a red zone. The district reported 396 fresh cases even as the count in Bengaluru Urban rose to 505, from 376 on the previous day.

Tamil Nadu recorded a rise after nearly 69 days. On Thursday [29 Jul 2021], the state recorded 1859 fresh cases as compared with 1756 on Wednesday [28 Jul 2021]. The daily cases in Maharashtra crossed 7000 after 7 days. In the northeast, the number of fresh cases remained high in Mizoram (1100), Manipur (1000), and Meghalaya (731).

India reported 557 deaths from the virus on Thursday [29 Jul 2021], with Maharashtra recording 190 fatalities, Kerala 128, Odisha 65, and Tamil Nadu.

Nepal, where daily new cases of the coronavirus have been on the rise, witnessed 2335 new cases on Thursday [29 Jul 2021]. With the latest rise, the country's caseload has gone up to 690 642. With a steady rise, the total coronavirus recoveries stand at 650 445 with 1373 discharges logged today [29 Jul 2021]. On the other hand, the countrywide death toll due to the disease climbed to 9807 with 16 new fatalities.

The COVID-19 cases which remained at a moderate level in the recent past have started to slightly soar again, bringing daily COVID cases close to the 2000 mark. The number of daily positive cases were ranging around 1300 in the last few weeks. However, it has now reached close to 2000. The number of COVID cases reported yesterday [28 Jul 2021] stood at 1940. It is after a month that the number of active cases surpassed the 1900 mark.

Commenting on the rise in COVID-19 cases, deputy director-general of health services Dr Hemantha Herath said this situation had to be taken seriously. "The COVID cases were plateauing at one point; however the cases are now gradually increasing. It is important that we all should act responsibly without letting the number of cases increase further," he underlined. He also said the delta variant cases could also be attributed to the rise in cases. "Now, it is no use of crying over spilled milk. What should be done is to strictly follow health guidelines and practices," he stressed.

Thus, he urged people to toe the line if we are to break free from COVID; otherwise, everyone will have to pay the price. "We have also observed with disappointment that hand washing and sanitizing facilities at public places, workplaces are not in operation in a proper manner," Dr Herath pointed out. "Although we initially saw companies and supermarkets were maintaining these facilities, now they have taken it for granted. Facilities like cleaning hands with soap and water or with an alcohol-based hand rub should be maintained until further notice," he added. Meanwhile, he warned of COVID clusters due to the ongoing protests being held violating health guidelines.

The South Asian COVID-19 situation, according to data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as of 30 Jul 2021 at 05:28 GMT:
Country: Total cases / Total deaths / Deaths per million population
India: 31 572 344 / 423 244 / 303
Bangladesh: 1 226 253 / 20 255/ 122
Pakistan: 1 024 861 / 23 295 / 103
Nepal: 690 642 / 9807 / 330
Sri Lanka: 304 202 / 4324 / 201
Afghanistan: 146 523 / 6677 / 167
Maldives: 77 202 / 220 / 399
Bhutan: 2506 / 2 / 3

Over the last 7 days, 279 282, 86 053, 24 827, 15 916, 12 904, and 3084 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Afghanistan, respectively, compared with 266 233, 68 426, 16 315, 12 156, 10 755, and 4388 COVID-19 in the preceding 7 days, revealing up-rising trends in all other 5 countries except Afghanistan.

The current proportional case positivity is much higher in Bangladesh compared to other South Asian countries. Although the daily case positivity remained static at around 30% over the last 2 weeks, a significant increase in the total number of daily cases in the last 7 days could be linked to a massive movement of people due to temporal withdrawal of lockdown from 15-23 Jul 2021 to celebrate Eid-ul-Adha ("Feast of the Sacrifice") across the country. It would not be surprising to see a significant up-rise of daily cases in the upcoming week thanks to that withdrawal, although the strict lockdown has been reimposed until 5 Aug 2021 with the possibility of further extension.

As already noted, Pakistan would face a challenging time due to the spread of the delta variant. The recent increase of new cases across the country is indicating the beginning of a new wave of the disease, as noted in item [D] above. Not only in Pakistan, there is a suspicion in Sri Lanka that the delta variant is also spreading in the country causing the development of a new peak of the disease in the country, as hinted in item [E] above.

A static trend of COVID-19 seen over the last 3 weeks or so is probably now turning into the development of a new wave of the disease in India as new surges of cases have been reported from several states, such as Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka, as indicated in item [B] above. A similar increasing trend of new cases is reported from Nepal. This new development scenario after a temporal pause suggests that although an effective lockdown can interrupt transmission of the delta variant significantly, its slow transmission would continue until the development of herd immunity in the community through natural infection, or artificially by effective vaccination. Perhaps nobody knows the threshold of seroprevalence that would be indicative of herd immunity against the delta variant in a population.
