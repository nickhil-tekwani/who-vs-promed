Nineteen new cases of food poisoning from eating raw oysters have spurred
Washington officials to widen a ban on oyster harvesting. At least 188
people in several states and British Columbia -- including 16 Oregonians --
have reported illnesses in recent weeks from eating tainted Northwest
oysters. Hundreds more probably have been sickened in what appears to be
the 2nd-biggest outbreak of its kind recorded in the USA.
Late on Thu 3 Aug 2006, Washington broadened the ban on recreational and
commercial oyster gathering to include all of Hood Canal and Oakland Bay
and Skookum Inlet in the South Puget Sound near Olympia. The closures also
spread to 2 northern Washington sites: Mystery Bay, near Port Townsend, and
Samish Bay, south of Bellingham. Parts of Hood Canal as well as Totten
Inlet and Eld Inlet near Olympia were closed the past 2 weeks.
Washington has reports of 91 people infected with the bacterium _Vibrio
parahaemolyticus_ from eating undercooked or raw oysters. That is up from
72 cases reported at the start of the week. The number of Oregon cases is
unchanged. Health workers have logged at least 75 cases in New York and 6
in British Columbia. A few residents of other states, including Utah and
Arizona, have reported getting sick after eating raw oysters in Oregon,
said William E Keene, an epidemiologist with Oregon's Acute and
Communicable Disease Prevention Program. None of the cases has been
definitely traced to oysters from Oregon waters.
Most of Washington's recent reports involve people sickened weeks ago. But
a few cases are new, Washington State Department of Health spokesman Tim
Church said. Tracing the origin of oysters eaten and testing different
oyster beds led to the expanded closures. Washington officials regularly
test closed areas and will reopen the harvest once bacterial levels drop to
a safe zone, Church said. A combination of warm weather and low midday
tides has raised bacteria levels in the water.
Since the condition usually is not severe, many people don't see a doctor
or get diagnosed with vibrio infections, Keene said. So "there are
undoubtedly hundreds and hundreds of cases happening now," he said, only
some of which get reported.
