Remarks
- Negative tests are systematically removed from the summary table.
- The category of probable cases includes all reported deaths for which it was not possible to obtain biological samples for laboratory confirmation.

News from the Ebola response

[Note the increased number of suspected cases in more health zones. With the GeneXpert automated Ebola test in place, the turnaround time to confirm or reject suspected cases is hours rather than days as in the W. African outbreak. This rapid assay allows infectious patients to be isolated quickly and their contacts traced promptly.

DRC investigates 10 more suspected Ebola cases
--------------------------------
With intensive efforts under way to identify any potential remaining Ebola cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the health ministry yesterday [13 Jun 2018] reported 10 more suspected cases, according to the latest update.

Illness totals fluctuate day to day as tests rule out earlier cases and more suspected illnesses are reported, but no confirmed cases have been tallied since 2 Jun 2018. According to the DRC health ministry, 6 of the 10 new suspected cases are in 2 remote forested locations -- Bikoro (4) and Iboko (2) -- and 4 are in Wangata health zone, an area that includes part of Mbandaka, the provincial capital.

The latest cases raise the total to 66, which includes 38 confirmed, 14 probable, and 14 suspected cases. The death count remains at 28.

Vaccination with Merck's VSV-EBOV continues, with 2633 people immunized so far [see updated number above, 2730 - LK]. The total includes 5 caregivers in Kinshasa, the country's capital, who will be taking care of a health ministry response team that will soon be deployed to the outbreak locations.

Tedros talks Ebola, neglected CAR
-------------------------------
The international community is making "significant" progress in responding to the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but not so much when it comes to addressing the needs of neighboring Central African Republic, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Tue [12 Jun 2018].

"We haven't seen any confirmed case since mid-May [2018]" in the areas of Mbandaka and Bikoro, the 2 epicenters of the Ebola outbreak in DRC, Tedros said in a video call from Kinshasa with Devex President Raj Kumar, which was later shown to conference participants at Devex World.

But they are boosting their efforts in Itipo, where the last confirmed case was just last week, 6 Jun 2018.

"The situation compared to a month ago is much better, significantly better ... but the work is not over until all is over," the WHO aid chief said, emphasizing continued surveillance and vigilance.

This is Tedros' 2nd visit to DRC in a month. His last visit was in May 2018, right before the start of the 71st World Health Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland.

...Organizations working on the ground are racing to contain it before it spills over to bordering nations and becomes a larger threat in the region. Ebola survivors in DRC are forming an association to raise awareness about the disease and how people can protect themselves.

WHO is also assisting neighboring countries, such as Congo Brazzaville and CAR, in strengthening surveillance in case of a cross-border spread of the disease.

The WHO chief made a specific clarion call for the international community to pay attention to CAR and the needs of the people there, many of whom are suffering from a broken health system after years of conflict. There are now more than 1 million internally displaced people in CAR, he said. Bangui was part of his itinerary in his latest trip.

"It's a neglected crisis, political, financially, operationally," he said. "The international community has neglected the Central African Republic, and this is not right."

[During the 8th outbreak of Ebola virus in the DRC, there was concern that the thousands of families running from the violence in the border town Bangassou in southeastern CAR and fleeing into northern Democratic Republic of Congo might become sick and carry the virus back to CAR, where it could spread rapidly. This could happen with any of the neighboring countries, so high alert must be maintained, even as the outbreak appears stable with no new chains of transmission identified. - Mod.LK]

Air Serv responds to Ebola crisis with Caravan loan
----------------------------
Air Serv International has sent one of its aircraft to assist Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) in response to an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

... A Cessna 208B Caravan, operated by Ugandan subsidiary Air Serv Limited, has been provided at no cost along with crew, an engineer, a base manager, positioning of the aircraft to and from the site, and 60 hours of flight time.

The aircraft departed its base at Entebbe in Uganda for Kinshasa in the DRC on 17 May 2018, picking up medical cargo and emergency medical response staff. It was then dispatched to Mbandaka, the main Ebola response base.

With a fleet of 6 Caravans, Air Serv specializes in "last mile" air transportation in support of humanitarian programmes. In addition to charter, facilities, maintenance and consulting services, it provides facilities, equipment and expertise in disaster areas.

[This generous donation of an aircraft will be immensely useful to the control effort in the more remote areas of the outbreak that are otherwise difficult to reach in a timely manner. The use of the craft and crew for 60 hours will go by very quickly but is clearly needed right now. According to their website, the group has flown 28 980 miles in May 2018 (184 129 miles year to date 2018), carried 53 799 pounds of cargo in May 2018 (year to date 278 393 pounds), and 1030 passengers (6693 year to date). Air Serv has provided air transport services for a wide variety of government agencies and NGOs in a wide variety of challenging operating environments around the world.

Ebola Outbreak: World Bank Disburses USD 12 million Grant, Warns on Risk of Spread
---------------------------
The World Bank says it has activated its pandemic cash disbursement through the Emergency Financing Facility (PEF) cash window to provide a USD 12 million grant to assist in the response to the recent Ebola virus outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Also, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned of the "significant risk" of the outbreak of the Ebola virus in the Congo spreading to neighbouring countries, noting that the number of confirmed cases is rising again.

The body warned that the number of confirmed cases is rising in that country and might soon spread to neighbouring countries.

"The outbreak of the Ebola virus in the Democratic Republic of Congo could become a qualifying or eligible event under the terms of the coverage provided by the Class B tranches of pandemic swaps and catastrophe bonds that were issued through the PEF transaction by the World Bank's International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) last year [2017]," the global body noted.

The World Bank, however, stated that the response by the international community to stem the spread of the outbreak has been significant, adding that by activating its Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF) cash window, there is hope of taming the spread of the disease to neighouring countries.

"When we last updated on the outbreak on 23 May 2018, there were 28 confirmed cases of the Ebola virus from within 3 health zones in Equateur Province, Congo. As of 3 Jun 2018, the figure has risen to 37 confirmed cases", it noted.

The WHO explained in its latest update: "From 4 Apr through 3 Jun this year [2018], a total of 56 EVD cases, including 25 deaths (overall case fatality ratio of 45 percent) have been reported from 3 health zones in the Equateur Province [see updated case numbers in [1] report above].

The report also noted that the number of contacts being followed up has risen as well, from 600 as of 21 May to now 880 as of 3 Jun 2018.

In an update yesterday [13 Jun 2018], the WHO warned of the potential for the Ebola virus outbreak to spread into neighbouring countries, with the risk of heightening the pandemic catastrophe bonds and swaps.

"There is a significant risk of spread of the ongoing EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to neighbouring countries because of the geographic proximity, high volume of movement of people and goods across borders and along the Congo River, insufficient national capacities to prevent, detect and respond to EVD cases, and other factors which may enable transmission," the WHO warned.

An emergency committee of the WHO has concluded that neighbouring countries should urgently strengthen their preparedness and surveillance in order to mitigate the risk of international spread.
