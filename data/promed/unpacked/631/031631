Update number - 332 (based on data up to 23 Dec 2018)
-----------------------------------------------------
Information in this report is categorized by influenza transmission zones, which are geographical groups of countries, areas or territories with similar influenza transmission patterns.

Summary
-------
In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere influenza activity continued to increase slowly.

- In North America influenza activity continued to increase overall with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 predominating.
- In Europe, influenza activity increased, with both A viruses circulating.
- In North Africa, increased influenza A(H3N2) detections were reported from mainly Egypt.
- In Western Asia, some countries reached medium levels of influenza intensity. Elevated but decreasing influenza activity continued to be reported across countries of the Arabian Peninsula.
- In East Asia, influenza season appeared to have started, with predominantly influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 detected.
- In Southern Asia, influenza detections rose sharply in recent weeks mainly due to increased influenza A(H3N2) detections in Iran and continued influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 detections in India.
- In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity returned to inter-seasonal levels with exception of some parts in Australia.
Worldwide, seasonal influenza A viruses accounted for the majority of detections.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 102 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 10 Dec 2018 to 23 Dec 2018 (data as of 4 Jan 2019 03:38:46 UTC).The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 97 188 specimens during that time period. 12 945 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 12 148 (93.8 percent) were typed as influenza A and 797 (6.2 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 5823 (77 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 1739 (23 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 40 (40.4 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 59 (59.6 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

[2] Influenza H3N2: outbreak in oncology ward, 2017
Date: Mon 7 Jan 2019

A nosocomial outbreak of influenza in an oncology ward likely occurred because sick healthcare workers (HCWs) came to work when feeling ill, according to a study detailing the outbreak in the American Journal of Infection Control [see reference below].

The outbreak of influenza A H3N2 took place over 8 days in November 2017 and affected 7 of 10 inpatients on the oncology ward, 16 HCWs (14 confirmed, 2 probable), and 2 visitors.

An anonymous survey was given to all HCWs and staff who had confirmed or probable influenza to characterize symptoms, timeline of illness, and reasons for attending work during illness.

Sixty-four percent of surveyed HCWs said they reported to work even when experiencing influenza-like illness symptoms; 56 percent said they did so because of a sense of duty as an HCW. Others said they felt their symptoms were minor and insignificant.

"It is possible that the nosocomial spread of influenza could have been prevented if the ill HCW either did not come to work or wore a mask," the authors concluded. "It is important for health care facilities to re-educate all employees annually about the importance of avoiding work during peak respiratory symptoms and strict adherence to respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene."

Am J Infect Control. 2019. pii: S0196-6553(18)31069-1. doi: 10.1016/j.ajic.2018.10.024; https://www.ajicjournal.org/article/S0196-6553(18)31069-1/fulltext

Outbreaks of respiratory infections, such as influenza, present a serious concern in hospital wards and specialty clinics facilities such as the oncology ward mentioned in above report. Patients in these settings are particularly vulnerable to influenza as their immune function is compromised and are at greater risk of severe symptoms and complications including pneumonia and death.

The report above clearly shows that healthcare workers must be properly trained on hand hygiene and infection control practices in all healthcare facilities, with emphasis on strict implementation and monitoring. Furthermore, medical surveillance of all healthcare personnel must be institutionalized, encouraging reporting of existing or emerging health issues for treatment and support. - Mod.UBA]
