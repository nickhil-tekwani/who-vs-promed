Anthrax kills 2 persons and 20 cows in Bawku
--------------------------------------------
An outbreak of anthrax, a deadly infectious disease has killed 2 persons and 20 cows in Gogo, a farming community in the Bawku West District of the Upper East Region. The victims, both males, are said to have handled the carcasses of affected cattle, according to veterinary officials in the area. Another 2 people have been admitted at the hospital for suspected anthrax symptoms.

In an interview with Myjoyonline, the DCE [district chief executive] for Bawku West, Hon. Moro Adam Anabah said the situation is under control adding that veterinary officials have moved to quarantine and vaccinate the animals in the area. He said the 20 dead cows have been buried and affected ones are vaccinated to prevent a major outbreak in the area.

The Bawku West district chief executive hinted that, there is a temporary ban on slaughtering and movement of animals in the area. He further hinted that several measures have been put in place to ensure that there is no outbreak of anthrax in the district.

He however suspected that the infectious disease might have infiltrated from Burkina Faso since the affected area shares a boundary with that country. The DCE said there will be security patrols on the borders to prevent movement of animals [into] the country. He therefore advised the people in the area to report any suspected symptoms of anthrax to the nearest clinic or the district assembly.

[While this repeats some of what we have read before it provides information on the total numbers of humans (4 sick, 2 died) and cattle (20 dead) affected, and confirms that the outbreak was at Gogo, not Googo.

The DCE may well be correct. Gogo is a mere 2 km (1.25 mi) from the border with Burkina Faso. From the pictures embedded in Google Earth it is an area of extensive cropland and open bush. [You can get a good oversight by clicking on the view from the Bawku Hills.] The countryside is open enough for tabanid flies to see cattle at a distance without any problems, and therefore to fly with contaminated mouthparts from an outbreak in Burkina Faso to the grazing stock at Gogo. While Burkina Faso has enzootic anthrax and plenty of reported outbreaks in cattle -- sheep and goats seem to be ignored -- with 15 outbreaks in 2005, (21) 2006, (11) 2007, (10) 2008, (6) 2009, (19) 2010, (3) 2011, and all with significant numbers of affected livestock, such as 369 in 2007, the 2 districts nearest the Ghanaian border -- Boulgou and Zoundweogo -- only reported single outbreaks in 2005 and Boulgou had a single outbreak in April 2011; events in the latter half of 2011 have yet to be reported to OIE in Paris. Of course much can go on that never reaches the authorities' ears in Ouagadougou.

Checking on Google Earth, Gogo village is 20 km (12.5 mi) due west of Bawku, which can be found at http://www.fallingrain.com/world/GH/10/Bawku.html. Gogo is at 11 deg 01'35.65" N, 0 deg 25'00.22" W. For a map of Burkina Faso, see http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/burkina_pol96.jpg.
