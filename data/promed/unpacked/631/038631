What we know about the impact of covid-19 on children
-----------------------------------------------------
Young children typically are "superspreaders" of respiratory germs, so it's puzzling that they don't seem to be major transmitters of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. They're also relatively absent among hospitalized patients. Initially, that was thought to be because they're less likely to become seriously ill if infected. Later studies indicate that those of primary school age, at least, may be less likely to catch the virus in the first place. Still, they're not immune to an array of indirect COVID-19 harms, including physical abuse, learning gaps, anxiety, and depression stemming from school closures, social isolation, and other stress-inducing consequences of the pandemic. That's informing considerations for how to safely keep kids in school.

1. How likely are kids to get COVID-19?
Of all COVID-19 cases reported worldwide last year [2020], children under 18 years accounted for about 8%, despite comprising 29% of the global population, according to the World Health Organization. Under-reporting of pediatric infections is likely. Compared to adults, children with COVID-19 are more likely to have no symptoms or, if they do, predominantly mild ones limited to the nose, throat, and upper airway. They rarely require hospitalization.

2. Why might kids be less susceptible?
There are multiple reasons. Children may have a stronger innate immune response to the virus, deploying nonspecific defense mechanisms within hours of its appearance in the body. Importantly, children may lack many of the factors thought to put adults, particularly the elderly, at risk of more serious illness from COVID-19, such as:
- damage to the lining of blood vessels that occurs with age and increases the susceptibility to the formation of dangerous clots;
- an abundance of the type of cell-surface protein that the coronavirus uses to invade cells and cause an infection;
- age-related changes in the immune system that hinder viral clearance;
- chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension as well as chronic lung, heart, or kidney disease.

3. Can kids still become seriously ill?
Yes. Death is extremely rare in children with a SARS-CoV-2 infection, although it can occur in those who are already very sick with cancer or other life-threatening conditions. Relatively more common is a serious blood disorder, known as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS) or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), which has affected more than 2000 children in the US alone. This potentially lethal condition is similar to Kawasaki disease and occurs at a rate of about 2 per 100 000 people younger than 21 years -- a tiny fraction of the 322 per 100 000 in which coronavirus infection is diagnosed in that age group. Although the condition is easily treated, some patients may suffer heart abnormalities of varying significance.

4. Anything else?
It's possible some children may suffer post-acute or "long COVID" symptoms much like the fatigue, muscle and joint pain, breathing difficulties, and heart palpitations reported in adults. Data are lacking though. A small study from Rome found half of pediatric patients enrolled had at least one persisting symptom after 120 days, with 43% suffering from an ailment that interfered with daily activities. The research, which was released [26 Jan 2021] ahead of peer-review and publication, was based on a survey of the caregivers of 129 COVID-19 patients ages 18 years and younger.

An even smaller study in September [2020] found heart damage in 1 in 7 college sports competitors, including in those whose coronavirus infection caused no obvious symptoms.

5. Do kids spread the virus?
Yes. They are capable of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to other children and to adults. However, studies have found that younger children, in particular, don't tend to be the main drivers of transmission within households and communities. In the US, resurgent COVID-19 epidemics in 2020 were driven by adults ages 20-49.

Even after schools reopened in October [2020], that age group accounted for almost 3/4 of SARS-CoV-2 infections, whereas less than 5% originated from children ages 0-9 and less than 10% from those ages 10-19, a study published in the journal Science found. Children under 10 also may be less susceptible to infection. That's reflected in the higher frequency of outbreaks reported in secondary and high schools compared with primary or elementary schools and daycare centers, in places where they have remained open.

6. Do the new variants change anything?
It's unclear. The B.1.1.7 variant discovered in the UK in September [2020] is significantly more transmissible than previously circulating strains, and has been associated with an uptick in spread across all age groups, including children under 15. The age distribution of COVID-19 cases may change as vaccination programs prioritizing older people are rolled out. Israel, where the variant has proliferated since December [2020], reported a steep jump in SARS-CoV-2 infections among young people in January [2021], threatening to prolong school closures. More than 50 000 children and teens tested positive in January [2021] -- more than the nation recorded in any month during its 1st and 2nd waves -- with the proportion of new daily cases among kids under 10 increasing by 23%, the BMJ medical journal reported [8 Feb 2021].

7. How risky are schools?
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in February [2021] that available data show "in-person learning in schools has not been associated with substantial community transmission." However, a review in December [2020] by its European counterpart found SARS-CoV-2 can spread within schools, and clusters of COVID-19 cases have been reported in preschools, primary, and secondary schools. The frequency of cases appears to reflect levels of community transmission; when it's low and when appropriate mitigation measures are applied, schools aren't likely to be the main drivers of COVID-19, according to the WHO. Staff and other adults spending prolonged periods in schools don't appear to have a higher risk of COVID-19 than other occupations.

8. Why close schools?
Health officials say such a decision shouldn't be taken lightly due to the negative impact school closures have on education and the physical and mental health of children, but rather as a last resort. Although keeping kids out of classrooms can help reduce transmission, that alone won't prevent COVID-19 cases in the community in the absence of other measures, such as restrictions on gatherings and mandatory mask-wearing.

9. How has the pandemic affected learning?
The disruption has been unprecedented, affecting more than 1.6 billion learners in over 190 countries in 2020 alone, according to UNESCO. The majority of students continued to be affected by full or partial closures of schools and universities into January [2021], increasing the risk of learning loss, dropping out of education, and social isolation. Although alternatives to in-person learning have been introduced, some 470 million pupils can't get access to online or other required content for remote education.

10. What effect will that have?
Prolonged school closures look certain to result in long-lasting economic and psychological harm, with deprived and marginalized groups affected most. The longer disadvantaged children are out of school, the less likely they are to return. According to UNICEF, kids from the poorest households are almost 5 times more likely to be out of primary school than those from the richest. Although children in low- and middle-income countries will be hardest hit, large inequities exist in wealthy countries too. Estimates indicate that 3-10% of students in the US have been "disengaged for almost the better part of a year," according to Annette C Anderson, deputy director of the Center for Safe and Healthy Schools at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Learning loss will probably be greatest among youth from low-income families, and Black and Hispanic students, exacerbating existing achievement gaps by 15-20%, McKinsey & Co. estimated in June [2020]. The consulting firm predicted US students in grades K-12 may lose, on average, the equivalent of a year of full-time work in lifetime earnings solely as a result of COVID-related learning losses. Black and Hispanic Americans would suffer the highest toll. That's supported by modeling by researchers at the University of Washington and University of California, Los Angeles who found, by not graduating high school, children may experience a lifetime of lower wages and disadvantage, and that prolonged, missed instruction may reduce life expectancy.

11. Why are schools so important?
Besides being a place of learning, schools often provide safe places, as well as social, emotional, and nutritional support. Dropping out of school or missing lessons increases the risk of teenage pregnancy, sexual exploitation, child marriage, violence, and food insecurity, according to UNICEF. Prolonged school closures may also disrupt important services, such as immunization and psychosocial support.

12. Are there measures that can mitigate risk for schools?
Yes. The CDC has outlined mitigation strategies that include the proper use of masks, social distancing, strict cleaning, and maintenance of classrooms, and rapid contact tracing, echoing guidelines and recommendations from the WHO and others. These also include guidance on producing outbreak prevention and management plans, testing for cases, ensuring adequate ventilation and hygiene practices, and frequent communication with parents, students, teachers, and staff. US President Joe Biden acknowledged that many of the CDC guidelines would be costly and difficult to implement, but called reopening schools a "national imperative.

[There are excellent references cited throughout this paper that are worth reading to gain greater understanding of children and COVID-19.

The desire to return to "normalcy" is strong and a major aspect of that is the opening of schools. This is a key aspect of getting parents back to work and helping children regain a sense of self, rebuild lost socialization skills, and resume learning in person. But the decision to do this is highly politicized and divisive. Children attend schools that are also populated by adults and they return to communities with naive individuals who may be at high risk. Good data where schools have reopened must be considered to make science-based decisions. The greatest confounder now is the existence of variants that may not be neutralized, as well as the original virus lineage, yet now must be taken into consideration. Most existing data, with some exceptions, are currently based on the original lineage.

It is essential that schools establish well thought out plans for safe reopening. Changes in school operations will need to be put into place and behavior modified. Rapid point of entry testing would likely be prohibitive in cost, but would provide the greatest confidence. One of the 1st moves should be to prioritize vaccination for teachers and school workers, regardless of age, necessary, albeit expensive. How schools will function in this new phase of the pandemic will be an evolving process . - Mod.LK]

[2] Germany: border checks
Date: Mon 15 Feb 2021

Coronavirus: new checks cause chaos at German-Czech border
----------------------------------------------------------
The queues formed a day after Germany introduced an almost blanket travel ban at its Czech and Austrian land borders in response to concerns about new coronavirus variants. The variants are likely more contagious and resistant to vaccines.

Under the new rules, only a handful of people are permitted to cross the border, including heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers. Anyone crossing must provide proof of a recent negative COVID-19 test.

On the E50/D5, which leads to the German city of Nuremberg, a queue of HGVs initially grew to over 20 kilometers long (12 miles), according to the motorway administration office and radio traffic news. On the E55/D8 motorway connecting Prague with Dresden, trucks were queuing all the way back to the Czech town of Usti and Labem on Monday morning [15 Feb 2021]. Police were stopping drivers before letting them enter the tunnel there.

Czech authorities have boosted their testing capacity in border regions in response to the travel ban. This includes using the fire brigade to set up additional testing facilities.

Germany's border restrictions for Austria, Czechia
Germany has stopped most land travel between regions in the east and south of the country and the neighboring Czech Republic and Austria's Tyrol, designating them "virus mutation areas." In addition to HGV drivers, only returning Germans and essential workers such as doctors, can cross the borders. Like the HGV drivers, they will also need a negative COVID-19 test, no older than 48 hours.

Around 1000 police officers were mobilized on Sunday [14 Feb 2021] to ensure the new border controls. State-owned rail company Deutsche Bahn suspended services to and from the affected areas. The measures are set to remain in place for at least 10 days.

"The measures have very severe consequences for the whole of Austria and therefore clearly contradict the lessons learned from last spring [2020]," Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said. Some carmakers have warned that the restrictions could once again bring factories to a standstill. The Czech Republic forms a key part of the supply chain for many German firms. The DSLV, the federal association for logistics in Germany, said it was "extremely troubled" by the new border restrictions.

The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) said supply chain disruption depended on the coronavirus test capacities at the borders. "We just have to wait and see" how the situation develops over the course of the day, a VDA spokesman added. DW spoke with German Green Party MEP [member of European Parliament] Jutta Paulus who also condemned the move, claiming that the situation could have been avoided if Germany had pushed for a unified EU strategy to combat the coronavirus pandemic in the latter half of 2020.

"I think [the] German presidency really did a bad job when in the last half year they did not even try to achieve a pan-European strategy with every member state more or less following the same rules, applying the same measures at the same case numbers," she told DW.

Germany defends measures
The German government rushed to defend the unpopular checks on Monday [15 Feb 2021]. "We have a situation in which we had to take all the necessary steps to prevent the virus variants ... spreading as quickly in Germany as they are doing unfortunately in neighboring countries," Steffen Seibert, Chancellor Angela Merkel's chief spokesman, told a news conference.

Germany on Monday [15 Feb 2021] said it would not rule out expanding new travel controls to its French border with coronavirus variants surging in the Moselle region. The suggestion has been met with disapproval in France.

[Closing land borders to traffic seems like a very severe move. Certainly within Europe, a pan-European policy would be more reasonable than country by country ruling. Demonstrating a negative COVID-19 test within the past 48 hours has limited usefulness, especially with long lines of traffic bumper to bumper over hours/days. Rapid testing at the border crossing would be more reliable, but that would be expensive and time consuming, equally slowing traffic.

A study by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, "Evaluating the effectiveness of travel bans." ScienceDaily. 3 Aug 2020. (http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/08/200803120134.htm) demonstrated the spread between countries could mostly be explained by "international flight connections between them, rather than shared borders (land-travel transmission). The researchers point out that this could also explain why Austria was relatively more affected by the virus than, for instance, neighboring countries in Eastern Europe, even though they share land borders with Austria."

[3] USA (Wisconsin): ice fishing
Date: Mon 15 Feb 2021
From: Blaise Vitale <bvitale@burnettmedicalcenter.com> [edited]


Ice fishing is a popular pastime in northern Wisconsin and Minnesota. Makeshift villages show up on area lakes every winter and remain there most of the winter. This may be the 1st documented outbreak of COVID-19 associated with ice fishing.

During my regular clinic on Friday [29 Jan 2021], I was assigned to do COVID-19 testing. Our small clinic at a Critical Access Hospital allows asymptomatic people to be tested by laboratory personnel but symptomatic people are supposed to be seen by a provider. The 1st 2 patients were a couple in their 30's who requested testing as they had found out on [28 Jan 2021] that someone with whom they had been ice fishing during a family outing on [23 Jan 2021] with 3 ice houses on a lake in northern Polk County, Wisconsin, had tested positive. Both of the members had started to develop mild upper respiratory symptoms on [27 Jan 2021]. Rapid antigen testing (Quidel) was positive for both patients. The family then brought multiple other members to our clinic over the course of the day and 9/9 tests were positive. The patients ranged in age from 4 to 67. No one reported sharing beverages but several meals were consumed in the ice houses. In total, 11 people were affected (including the presumed index case who was tested early in the week with a PCR test at another clinic). 3 patients were pediatric (2 of whom were asymptomatic). Subsequently, all 9 positive rapid antigen tests were confirmed positive by a send-out PCR test.

When I saw the 67-year-old, I alerted her to the availability of administering monoclonal antibodies to mitigate the risk for severe disease. Her 69-year-old husband had tested positive at a drive through site in Polk County, WI on [28 Jan 2021] but was not notified about the availability of treatment. He then came into the office and was evaluated as well. He did have a symptomatic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy but was otherwise healthy. After receiving an exam, being provided with the appropriate educational material, and a discussion of risks and benefits, the 67- and 69-year-old received infusions of bamlanivimab on the same day.

The 69-year-old did report some low grade fevers overnight as well as chest pain such that he presented to our Emergency Department the following day. Because of an abnormal EKG and a mildly elevated troponin, he was transferred to the Twin Cities for evaluation but was discharged after an overnight period of observation without any intervention. The 67-year-old had complete resolution of her symptoms within 2 days.

While preparing this report, our clinic subsequently found a 2nd outbreak associated with ice fishing on a Burnett County lake.

These may be the 1st reported outbreaks of COVID-19 associated with ice fishing. As demonstrated by this report, while ice fishing is usually thought of as a safe outdoor activity, fishing within the more comfortable ice houses currently on the market does represent a potential unrecognized hazard.

Additional information
On follow-up, 40 people participated in 7 different ice houses. Most of these were very nice RV [recreational vehicle) like structures with heaters and several of them had bathrooms. About half of the people had been there the night prior. There was food in most of the houses but individual meals were largely served within family groups. There were a total of 14 new positive cases traced back to this event. 5 people at the event had already been infected and recovered from COVID-19. One person had already been vaccinated. The older couple described were there only for about 3-4 hours. The index case worked at a dental office and was thought to have been infected at work. When she became mildly symptomatic, she was tested, but because she didn't think she had it, she did not quarantine. There were no additional medical complications and everyone has completely recovered.

I was told that everyone visited multiple houses and socialized throughout the day. The 10 patients I saw were associated with 3 ice houses and the index case apparently visited all 3.

I would also doubt that windows were opened. In my experience, the only reason that would occur while ice fishing is if the house overheated. Windows are usually built into houses for getting in natural light rather than for increasing ventilation. With multiple people moving around (including multiple children) I suspect the doors opened often enough that windows were not necessary to prevent the houses from overheating (and some of these fancy RV-like ice houses can keep the temperature regulated at a certain height. I do know that masks were not worn as they thought this was a safe "outdoor" activity. The only other information was that 2 additional children did have mild flu-like symptoms around the time of this outbreak but their parents elected to not get them tested.

[ProMED would like to thank Dr Vitale for sharing this information with us - identifying a new superspreading event, ice fishing, that needs to be highlighted as a high risk activity.

According to Wikipedia, "An ice shanty (also called an ice shack, ice house, fishing shanty, fish house, fish coop, bobhouse, ice hut, or darkhouse) is a portable shed placed on a frozen lake to provide shelter during ice fishing. They can be as small and cheap as a plastic tarp draped over a frame of 2-by-4s or as expensive as a small cabin with heat, bunks, electricity, and cooking facilities. More durable ice houses are generally left on a lake for the duration of the ice fishing season, although this can cause problems, such as thaws and re-freezing causing houses to be immoveably frozen onto the lake. Lighter, cheaper versions can collapse into a package to be moved from lake to lake during the season." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_shanty).

From the description of the event and ice houses used, it seems as though this was an indoor rather than outdoor event, a perfect set up for transmission if an infected individual was present. The false sense of security in gatherings with family and friends, using a temporary RV-like structure... small quarters so social distancing wasn't practiced and masks weren't used, especially when eating or drinking... need we say more...? - Mod.MPP]

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (56 233), Brazil (32 197), and Spain (30 251) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 6814 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 14 Feb 2021 to late 15 Feb 2021). Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (4 countries) include the USA, Brazil, Spain, and Russia (14 207). A total of 42 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 22 of the 42 countries are from the European region, 8 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 1 is from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 12.8%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 6.0%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 21.8% decrease in daily reported cases and 1.8% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported cases over 284 000 newly confirmed infections daily in the past 24 hours with over 109.67 million cumulative reported cases and with over 2.41 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, even in the face of overall decreasing reports. The Eastern Mediterranean countries have been demonstrating decreasing case counts while the Western Pacific and African countries are increasing in reported cases. - Mod.MPP]
