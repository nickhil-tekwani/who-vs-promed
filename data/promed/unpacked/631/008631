[Translated & summarized by Mod.JW

In Itenez province, one person has died from hemorrhagic fever, and one
suspect case, a man who died in the region of Yacuma, is awaiting
confirmation. (Another suspect case has been diagnosed as due to hepatic
cirrhosis & sepsis.)
The inhabitants of the provinces of Itenez, Cercado y Yacuma (Beni) are at
risk from the disease. It is recommended that they cut the grass around
their houses & store foodstuffs out of reach of the short-tailed rat,
_Callomys callosus_ , which carries Machupo virus, the cause of the disease.

[Bolivian hemorrhagic fever appeared for the first time in 1963, when it
killed a number of the inhabitants of the small town, San Joaquin del Beni.
A team from MARU, led by Karl Johnson, flew down with a fully-equipped
field lab, isolated the virus, identified the rodent host & stopped the
epidemic in its tracks by trapping out the rats. I was privileged to visit
their team in the field, & was there when they isolated the virus. Since
then, sporadic cases have occurred in the same region. - Mod.JW
