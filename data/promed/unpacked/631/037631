Foot and mouth disease in Syria
--------------------------
(Date of previous outbreak reported to the OIE: January 1999).
Emergency report
Information received on 18 Dec 2002 from Dr George Khoury, Director of
Animal Health Services, Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform, Damascus:
Report date: 17 Dec 2002.
There were some suspected cases of foot and mouth disease (FMD) at the
beginning of February 2002 in 2 outbreaks in Damascus province. At the end
of November 2002, the number of cases was 11. Strict quarantine procedures
have been applied in the area.
A prophylactic vaccination campaign against FMD is implemented twice a year
and there have been no cases in any other areas in Syria.
Note by the OIE Central Bureau: The report of the Institute for Animal
Health, Pirbright, United Kingdom (OIE Reference Laboratory for foot and
mouth disease) dated November 2002 indicates that, of the samples submitted
by Syria (collected from cattle between 9 Feb 2002 and 11 Nov 2002), 6
samples were positive for FMD serotype O and 3 were positive for FMD
serotype A. The complete report will be published in the OIE Bulletin in
early 2003.

[The most prevalent FMD virus (FMDV) serotypes in the Middle Eastern
countries is serotype O. Serotype A is sporadically present as well. FMDV
of serotype Asia 1 has re-emerged recently in Iran and Turkey, in addition
to serotypes O and A.
Syria's previous reported FMD outbreak occurred in 1999,
involving serotype O. The last reporting of FMD in Syria, caused by other
FMDV serotypes, occurred on the following years: Serotype A -- 1988;
Serotype Asia 1 --1988; Serotype C -- 1969; Serotype SAT1 -- 1962.
Vaccinations of bovines are carried out there with a trivalent vaccine,
including FMDV serotypes O, A and Asia1. During 2001, 800 000 vaccinations
have been reported by the Syrian authorities to the OIE.
FMDV serotype O is known to affect, in the Middle East, all domestic
ruminants, namely bovines, ovines, and caprines. During outbreaks of FMDV
serotype A in neighbouring Israel during the 70's and the early 80's,
clinical manifestation of the disease were restricted to cattle, no disease
signs seen in adjacent sheep flocks. This, contrary to distinct clinical
signs, observed in cattle and sheep when serotype O was the
causative agent. It would be interesting to obtain information on the
species affected by FMDV serotype A, during the recent outbreaks in
Syria.- Mod.AS]
