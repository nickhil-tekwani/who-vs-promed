Health authorities are cautioning pet owners and others who come into contact with cats and dogs to be extra vigilant about a deadly infection that has surfaced in Japan.

On [10 Jan 2018], the health ministry notified the Japan Medical Association, Japan Veterinary Medical Association and municipal governments nationwide of the 1st fatal case of _Corynebacterium ulcerans_ [infection].

_Corynebacterium ulcerans_ is a bacterium that can infect both humans and animals, such as dogs, cats and cows. Humans can be infected simply when an animal sneezes or has a runny nose. Symptoms, which include sore throat and coughing, can be treated with antibacterial drugs. In worst cases, however, patients can die from dyspnea, or labored breathing.

The fatality that generated alarm concerned a woman in her 60s from Fukuoka Prefecture who was rushed to a hospital by ambulance after developing breathing difficulties in May 2016. She died 3 days later. The [bacterium] was found in her blood and other parts of her body. The ministry said it was the first fatal case in Japan of this particular infection.

The woman was known to feed and care for three stray cats. It seems highly likely that the animals were the cause of infection.

According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, the first domestic case of _Corynebacterium ulcerans_ infection in Japan was confirmed in 2001. By last November [2017], 25 cases had been reported, and many of the patients are believed to have been infected by dogs or cats.

As medical institutions are not required to report this bacterial infection to health authorities under the Infectious Diseases Control Law, it may have been overlooked. The health ministry is calling on institutions to report any suspected instances of patients who could have contracted the disease. "Don't touch dogs and cats with symptoms such as sneezing or a runny nose more than necessary, and take them to the vet as soon as possible," said a ministry official in charge of the case. "When handling them, wear gloves and a face mask, and be sure to thoroughly wash your hands afterward."

No human-to-human infection of _Corynebacterium ulcerans_ has been reported in Japan.

[Corynebacteria are Gram-positive, non-sporulating, aerobic, or facultatively anaerobic, pleomorphic bacilli. Pathogenic Corynebacteria include _C. diphtheriae_, _C. ulcerans_ and _C. pseudotuberculosis_. Strains of _C. diphtheriae_ that elaborate a toxin encoded by bacteriophage cause respiratory and cutaneous diphtheria. Toxin expression is regulated by an iron-dependent chromosomal repressor gene. Conversion of non-toxigenic strains bearing the toxin gene into toxigenic strains is possible. The toxin is responsible for systemic complications that include myocarditis, neuropathy and focal necrosis of liver and kidneys. Non-toxigenic strains of _C. diphtheriae_ can cause local respiratory infection that is usually milder and without membrane formation, as well as invasive disease, such as bacteremia, endocarditis, abscesses, and bone and joint infections. In contrast to toxin-induced disease, infections with non-toxigenic strains are not preventable by vaccination.

_C. ulcerans_ and very rarely _C. pseudotuberculosis_, (both are zoonotic pathogens) can also carry the same bacteriophage as do toxigenic strains of _C. diphtheriae_, produce diphtheria toxin and thus also cause diphtheria. Whereas humans are the only reservoir for _C. diphtheriae_, _C. ulcerans_ is a commensal in animals and has been isolated from domestic and wild animals, which can serve as reservoirs for human infection. _C. ulcerans_ causes mastitis in cattle and goats, and contact with infected dairy animals and consumption of contaminated milk have been associated with respiratory diphtheria-like disease caused by _C. ulcerans_ (https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/46/3/395/390445), as have pet dogs and cats (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/9/6/02-0645_article). Unlike _C. diphtheriae_, human-to-human transmission of _C. ulcerans_ has been documented only once when a 2-person cluster suggested an initial zoonotic and a subsequent human-to-human transmission event (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X15005534). To my knowledge, _C. ulcerans_ has not been reported to cause disseminated disease, except for mention of one fatal case in Brazil in 2008, in an elderly woman with disseminated disease (https://emedicine.staging.medscape.com/article/215100-overview#a6).

The patient with _C. ulcerans_ infection in the above case report was said to have disseminated disease, i.e., "the bacterium was found in her blood and other parts of her body." However, the source for her _C. ulcerans_ bacteremia, and whether she had respiratory or cutaneous diphtheria and whether the strain of _C. ulcerans_ produced diphtheria toxin is not stated. More information on this patient would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.
