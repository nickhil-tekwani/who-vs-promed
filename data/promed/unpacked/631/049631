There is a total of 9 confirmed cases of _Salmonella [enterica_
serotype] Hadar. All but 2 were inpatients. None of the people known
to be affected are food workers. The original source is, so far,
unknown although a food source can't be definitively excluded. The 3
people recently identified as having _S._ Hadar most probably
acquired their infection through person-to-person spread.
