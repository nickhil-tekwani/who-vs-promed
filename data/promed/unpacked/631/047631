Eight people have died of yellow fever in Brasilia since an outbreak of the
disease near the capital at the end of December 1999, officials said
Thursday.
The latest victim was a young woman of 23 from the city of Sao Sebastiao
who died Wednesday at a Brasilia hospital, according to the records of the
Evandro Chagas Institute in the city of Belem in Para.
Brasilia Health Secretary Alice Mochel told EFE that the institute, one of
the world's top centers of tropical disease research, was studying the 86
cases of alleged yellow fever, 29 of which had been confirmed. Eight of the
patients have died.
The Health Ministry confirmed that experts continued to look into the death
of another young woman early in March in the state of Sao Paulo, shortly
after she received the yellow fever vaccine. This death compromised the
nationwide vaccination campaign and led Sao Paulo authorities to restrict
the inoculation campaign.
"In two years, 32 million people were vaccinated against yellow fever in
Brazil and only two of them developed problems, one of them fatal," said
Health Minister Jose Serra at the time.
The vaccination campaign is being complemented with strict control of
travelers from countries where there have been outbreaks of the disease,
particularly those from Andean nations, who must submit evidence showing
that they have been vaccinated within the past 10 days.

[I think the journalist is confused -- there have been 8 deaths, but not
all of them in patients in Brasilia. All the cases have been contracted
outside the Capital District in rural areas. But a risk of urbanization
does exist; the vector mosquito, _Aedes aegypti_ has been found in Brasilia
& its satellite cities. Measures are being
taken to implement source reduction.
When you vaccinate 32 million people, somebody is sure to die shortly
afterwards by simple random chance. I have not seen any evidence that the
unfortunate person died of yellow fever. - Mod.JW
