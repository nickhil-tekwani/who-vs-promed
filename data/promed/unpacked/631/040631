[The good news is that no new countries have been added to the list where either WPV or circulating vaccine derived polioviruses have been identified in the past week.

The not so good news is that circulation of both WPV's and cVDPV's continues in many countries.

It should be mentioned here that while I provide the link to the Polio eradication website, the actual data presented arrives in an email alert on a weekly basis and at times the information in the email and on the website are not exactly the same.

The other day while reviewing the WHO report on the cVDPV situation in Africa, I noticed that Mozambique wasn't included in the discussion. Curious as it is still present on the list of countries with cVDPV activity in the past 12 months.

As done in previous posts, to visualize all of this activity, I am putting links to HealthMap/ProMED maps of countries with poliovirus activity during the past 12 months below. The size of the list remains impressive.
