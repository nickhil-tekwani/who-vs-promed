[1] India, West Bengal: cockfighting and route of infection

RE: [6] India, West Bengal: route of infection in posting
'Avian influenza (43): multicountry 20080311.0982'
---------------------------------------------------------
India's refraining from stamping-out the 2 Murshidabad outbreaks in January
2008, as candidly revealed by Minister Anisur Rahman [see item 1 in posting
20080311.0982], may have cost dearly but, luckily, so far without
(noticeable) human health implications.

The story behind the story in West Bengal, as in countless similar
situations in Thailand several years ago and Indonesia to this day, is that
the flocks of politically well-connected cockfighters were exempted, and
predictably the movements of gamecocks and cockfighting participants
subsequently became a vector for the disease.

The same thing happened with exotic Newcastle disease 5 years ago in
southern California.

[We are grateful to Merritt for the above significant piece of information.
The March 2008 issue of Animal People includes the following supplementary
information:

"A January 2008 outbreak of H5N1 in West Bengal near the Orissa border was
declared contained in early February, after about 3.4 million chickens and
domestic ducks were culled, but the cull was subverted by villagers who
bootlegged so many birds to market before they could be killed that the
price of poultry fell by half.

"Another 2.1 million chickens were believed to be at risk in Orissa, Assam,
Bihar, and Jharkhand states, but Orissa balked at ordering a cull, after
Veterinary Officers Training Institute officer-in-charge Ramakanta
Mohapatra reported that the 900 000 chickens said to be at risk in Orissa
included 10 000 to 12 000 gamecocks.

"Orissa minister for fisheries and animal resource development Golak Bihari
Naik told The Hindu that the gamecocks are the "life and pride" of rural
tribal families". - Mod.AS]

Half-done vaccination poses high bird-flu risk
----------------------------------------------
Viet Nam is now facing high risks of bird flu spreading nationwide because
of low immunity rate on poultry and the absence of followed-up vaccination
on poultry, an officially from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development said.

Bui Ba Bong, deputy minister of agriculture and rural development, told the
Vietnam News Agency yesterday that the rate of immunity on poultry was low
as the vaccination program had not been refreshed after a long time, which
will make bird flu epidemic spread widely. "Aside from that, the poor
quality of propaganda against the epidemic at grassroots level will make it
difficult to contain bird-flu outbreaks nationwide," he added.

Nguyen Huy Nga, head of the Preventive Medicine Department under the
Ministry of Health, said that bird flu would become complicated due to
uncontrolled transportation of poultry across border gates.

Since the beginning of this year [2008], market monitors have reported
booming illicit trade in poultry across the border. Market watchdogs under
the Ministry of Industry and Trade said they had confiscated and destroyed
more than 7000 fowls of unclear origins within the past 2 months.

Hoang Van Nam, deputy head of the National Animal Health Bureau, yesterday
[12 Mar 2008] said that bird flu is still prevalent in 8 provinces, namely
Quang Ninh, Tuyen Quang, Ninh Binh, Vinh Long, Phu Tho, Ha Nam, Hanoi and
Quang Binh.

So far this year, bird flu on humans has killed 4 people in the country.

On Tuesday [11 Mar 2008], the National Animal Health Department reported
that 4 rare Owston palm civets (chrotogal ownstoni) at Cuc Phuong National
Park in Ninh Binh Province died last month [Feb 2008] from bird flu.

Two independent tests conducted by the tropical disease hospitals in Hanoi
and HCMC confirmed that the wild cats - listed in Viet Nam's Red Book as
endangered species, were infected with the H5N1 virus. Two other Owston
palm civets, 5 pee-with hoopoe birds, 2 douc langurs, 2 common palm civets
and one loris at the park, which is about 100 kilometers [62 miles] south
of Hanoi, were also reported to have died within recent weeks. However,
test on blood samples from the creatures proved negative for H5N1, said
park director Truong Quoc Bich [see commentary].

To prevent bird flu from further spreading, Nam said that the national
vaccination program for poultry will begin in April [2008]. Around 205
million vaccine doses from China will soon arrive in Viet Nam.

Currently, the National Animal Health Department is using the vaccine kept
in storage since last year.

[Following a subscriber's query, ProMED-mail asked to be informed if the
other animals which recently died in the Cuc Phuong National Park, in
addition to the 5 Owston palm civets, were autopsied and
laboratory-examined, and about the results of such investigations [see
posting 20080312.0991]. This request is apparently addressed in the current
newswire: according to park director Truong Quoc Bichthe, blood samples
from "the creatures" (2 other Owston palm civets, 5 pee-with hoopoe birds,
2 douc langurs, 2 common palm civets and one loris) proved negative for
H5N1. - Mod.AS]

Poultry industry losses mount as bird flu spreads
-------------------------------------------------
Despite stepped up biosecurity at farms and markets, as well as an
awareness-raising campaign on TV, radio and in the newspapers, bird flu
continues to spread in Bangladesh. A total of 47 of the country's 64
districts are now affected. In the past 10 days the number of affected
sub-districts and farms has increased from 107 to 124 and 196 to 220
respectively.

Avian influenza has caused an estimated USD 746 million in losses to the
country's poultry sector. Each month the sector is losing USD 120 million,
said Moshiur Rahman, president of the Bangladesh chapter of the World
Poultry Science Association (WPSA) at a media conference earlier this month
[March 2008].

Monthly consumption of poultry meat has declined from 26 600 metric tonnes
(mt) in October 2007 to 12 000 mt in March 2008 -- a fall of nearly 55 per
cent in 4 months, said Muhammad Abdus Saleque, general secretary of WPSA's
Bangladesh chapter.

About 50 per cent of poultry farms have been closed and 2.5 million people
out of the 6 million involved in the industry have been made jobless. In
fact, many people have removed chicken and eggs from their menus altogether.

Rahman said the government had been enforcing strict biosecurity measures
at poultry farms, but this alone would not solve the present crisis. Rahman
and Saleque stressed the need for immediate implementation of short and
long term strategic plans focusing on biosecurity, surveillance,
rescheduling of bank loans for small farmers, and further involvement of
the government to offset losses.

According to the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock, there are about 150
000 poultry farms in Bangladesh which produce 320 000 mt of meat and over 5
[billion] eggs annually. Investment in the sector is estimated at close to
USD 2 billion, while 89 per cent of people living in rural areas rear
chickens at home.

According to the government, more than one million birds have been culled
at 426 farms -- 384 commercial and 42 backyard farms -- so far. The H5N1
virus has been confirmed in 201 poultry farms -- 159 commercial and 42
backyard farms.

"Price hikes in poultry feed, lower prices of chicken and eggs, and
dwindling demand has shaken the foundations of the poultry industry that
had been growing at an astounding 20 per cent [per year] since 1994," said
Prof Habibur Rahman of Bangladesh Agricultural University. He told the
media there was nothing to panic about if people ate chicken meat cooked
properly at 70 degrees centigrade [158 DEG F]. "Hard-boiled or deep fried
eggs are also 100 per cent safe. Only the unprotected poultry handlers and
workers of an infected farm could be at risk, no one else," he said.
