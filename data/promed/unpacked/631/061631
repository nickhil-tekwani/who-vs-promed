MORTALITY, EXCESS, HOSPITAL - BRAZIL (RIO DE JANEIRO)

[Paraphrase by Mod.JW]
Routinely collected statistics for inpatient mortality in a municipal
hospital in Rio de Janeiro for the first 4 months of 1999 showed an
unexplained increase. The Municipal Secretary of Health requested an
investigation. It was discovered that the excess occurred in the Intensive
Care Unit, during 36 days on which a particular male nurse was on duty, who
began work in the Unit on 10 Jan 1999. The average number of deaths in the
Unit during his duty days was 3.6, compared with 1.9 on the days he was off.
Another hospital worker reported seeing the male nurse give an injection to
a patient who immediately died. The police were informed, and on Fri 8 May
1999 they entered the hospital disguised as medical staff. They arrested
the male nurse, who reportedly confessed to killing "a maximum of 5 to 6
people in the past 2 months, " including 2 on the day of his arrest, either
by injecting potassium chlorate or unplugging their life support. Motive,
"to alleviate the suffering of patients who were obviously going to die,
and that of their relatives." But based on the hospital statistics, police
suspect he could have killed as many as 153 patients. However, it would be
useless to order autopsies on those suspected of having been his victims,
since potassium chlorate leaves no traces in the body.

[Potassium chlorate is freely available in hospitals. Intravenous injection
causes potassium overload in the bloodstream leading to immediate,
irreversible cardiac arrest (the heart stops). I seem to remember a similar
case in recent years in a hospital in the USA.
This outbreak shows the value of routine collection of hospital statistics
and of acting on them promptly. The Municipal Secretary of Health for Rio
de Janeiro is to be congratulated - Mod.JW]
