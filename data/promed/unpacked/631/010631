[Non-bacterial "aseptic"meningitis is a common manifestation of enteroviral
infection. Many enteroviruses (Polioviruses 1-3, Coxsackie viruses A and B,
Echoviruses 1-9, 11-27, and 29-34) are associated with aseptic meningitis.
Recovery is usually complete with a few weeks, although irritability and
weakness may persist for a longer period. Infection during the first year
of life carries a slight risk of neurological damage. The identity of the
enterovirus responsible for this outbreak is not stated. The diversity of
agents involved means that a primary infection does not confer immunity to
subsequent infection by a different enterovirus - Mod. CP
