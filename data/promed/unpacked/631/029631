Moderator AS commented: "Investing the efforts and financial means of the
dedicated charities in well-maintained animal shelters within Sri Lanka,
deserves consideration. Such policy could contribute to improve (or save)
the lives of a larger number of animals without exposing their health and
welfare to (long-distance) transport-related stress and without putting the
health and indeed the very life of other animals and of humans at serious
risk."

I am somewhat acquainted with Kim Cooling, the founder of the charity that
imported the rabid puppies into Britain, who was among the 3 people who
were bitten, and am acquainted with the founders and chief executives of
many of the other charities that bring puppies for adoption to western
Europe and the US from the developing world.

My employer, Animal People Inc, has itself twice imported dogs, from Taiwan
in 1998 and from Thailand after the Indian Ocean tsunami. Animal People Inc
chief executive Kim Bartlett was the founding patron of the Homeless
Animals Protection Society of Ethiopia, which sent 4 dogs to Texas in a
high-profile rescue case last summer [2007]. As well as editing the Animal
People newspaper, I am US trustee for the Romanian League in Defense of
Animals, which has exported dogs to the Netherlands, Sweden, Britain,
Germany, and the US.

The motivations of charities and individuals differ, but most often "the
efforts and financial means of the dedicated charities" involved in such
projects are raised in the 1st place by presenting particular rescued
animals as ambassadors for thousands of others who are in need. A single
charismatic dog with a memorable story can raise funds and volunteer
support more effectively at a public event than tens of thousands of mailed
appeals, or hundreds of thousands of emails.

Importing dogs from the developing world is costly and difficult, and
except in cases such as bringing dogs to the US from Puerto Rico and
Mexico, it is not possible to charge an adoption fee that recovers even
half the cost of the import -- whereas, adoption agencies commonly set
their fees for locally rescued dogs at an average of 50 per cent of
recovery. However, the "interest magnet" value of importing dogs not only
compensates, but tends to make possible whatever else the charity is able
to do to help improve the shelters and animal hospitals in the nations from
which the dogs come.

What does this have to do with rabies control? Quite a bit, especially at
the fundraising and publicity end.

First, it is important to recognize that the publicity aspect of adoption
import programs works 2 ways. As well as enhancing the profile of the
importing charity in the donor nation, such programs enhance the image of
dogs in the nations that the dogs come from.

The despised pariah dog who is flown from poverty to privilege tends to
cause whole communities to look at their dogs differently, more positively,
and thereby become more receptive to vaccination, deworming, anti-mange
treatment, sterilization, etc of the dogs they have usually been feeding
but not otherwise claiming as their own. If you want to get street dogs
vaccinated, there is no more effective means than persuading the people who
toss scraps to the dogs that they have value, and should be claimed and
treated responsibly.

[Parenthetically, I might mention that several years ago the 4 major
charitable animal shelters in Beijing were among them adopting out fewer
dogs per year than any PetSmart or PETCO store does over a typical weekend.
Then, at our suggestion, 2 major US charities flew an entire planeload of
dogs from Beijing to the US -- a project, which did not even recover 10 per
cent of the investment in adoption fees. However, it significantly
stimulated adoptions in Beijing, as people there began to realize that
their shelters do have many wonderful dogs in need of homes, and in that
sense the flight paid for itself many times over.]

Second, the publicity opportunity created by a properly managed
high-profile adoption export is an opportunity to emphasize the importance
of vaccination -- to talk to the local media about why each dog who is
exported must be inoculated, quarantined, etc.

Third, these programs are an effective avenue for western charities to
partner with local shelters and animal hospitals without competing in any
way with them, and as such, they become conduits for sharing expertise
about disease prevention -- not only in prevention of rabies, but also in
such areas as maintaining proper asepsis when performing surgical
sterilization.

The animals I have had anything to do with importing from anywhere have all
been quarantined before ever leaving their original nations. I often
emphasize the importance of pre-export quarantine in articles and personal
presentations. If Cooling had followed this procedure, the rabid dog who
bit her would never have left Sri Lanka. I emphasize utmost caution in
operating any adoption program, including within the US, where about 25 per
cent of all the dogs in shelters these days are of the 2 breed types -- pit
bull terrier and Rottweiler -- which have accounted for approximately 75
per cent of the total actuarial risk accrued by all dogs in the 27 years I
have personally tracked the data.

While caution is always in order, trying to halt adoptions of imported dogs
would minimally reduce the risk of rabies or other diseases spreading to
adopting nations, at cost of cutting off an economic and educational
lifeline to the developing world. In theory, it is possible to raise funds
to help dogs in the developing world without actually having a dog to
introduce at a benefit function -- but dogs have thrived among us for as
long as they have because they are the most accomplished of beggars.

My standard sermon on fundraising for developing world animal charities,
delivered many dozens of times on every inhabited continent, is called
"Learn from your dog," because one friendly dog can open more wallets in
less time than the most accomplished of pickpockets, and get the donors to
say the thank-yous.

Accidental rabies imports emphasize value of quarantine
-------------------------------------------------------
Health experts are hoping the prominence of the most recent rescuer
involved in accidentally importing a rabid dog will emphasize to the
international rescue community the need to quarantine as well as vaccinate.

SOS Sri Lanka founder Kim Cooling and 2 workers at the Chingford Quarantine
Kennels in north east London were repeatedly bitten by an 8 week old puppy
between 23-25 Apr 2008. The puppy died later on 25 Apr 2008. Rabies was
diagnosed a few hours afterward. "She just snapped at me and was snapping
at the other pups. She was not her usual sweet self. She bit me in 3
places, on my wrist, hand, and chin," Cooling told Mark Townsend and
Caroline Davies of The Observer. Cooling, a social worker and former nurse,
was hospitalized for observation. "I am shattered at the moment, but I am
feeling okay," she said. "I had already been vaccinated, and have had
boosters."

The rabid puppy was one of 13 whom Cooling brought from Sri Lanka on 17 Apr
[2008]; 4 others were killed and decapitated for rabies testing after the
first pup died. "She had been vaccinated in Sri Lanka, but the infection
must already have been in her," Cooling said of the puppy who bit her. "The
other 4 dogs showed no signs of illness to me. I thought that they could
have been monitored," Cooling added. Involved in animal rescue in Sri Lanka
and Thailand since 1998, Cooling "has found UK homes for 40 dogs from Sri
Lanka in recent years," Townsend and Davies wrote.

"A total of 20 cases of rabies have been reported in England and Wales
since 1946, which were all imported," noted BBC News. Britain requires a 6
month quarantine of dogs imported from nations with active rabies
reservoirs. Because the Cooling case occurred in a quarantine center, the
rabid puppy had restricted opportunity to infect others. But if the puppy
had been quarantined for 2 weeks before being flown to Britain, the entire
incident would not have occurred -- at least not in Britain, Department of
Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) staff noted.

Two recent Belgian cases were not so well contained. Belgium had not had a
canine rabies case since 1999, and has been officially free of canine
rabies since 2001, but that status was jeopardized after a family in the
Brussels suburb of Beersel in July 2007 smuggled a 4 week old puppy home
from a holiday in Morocco. The puppy was euthanised in October 2007 after
exhibiting rabies symptoms. When she proved to be rabid, a 2nd dog in the
household was also killed. The family received post exposure vaccination.

In March 2008, a Belgian woman who was on holiday in the Republic of the
Gambia rescued and smuggled home a 6 month old puppy whom she found injured
in a street. The puppy passed through Dakar and spent time in France as
well as Belgium, but apparently did not bite anyone before showing rabies
symptoms on 16 Apr 2008. She died at a veterinary clinic on 21 Apr 2008,
and was found to be rabid on 24 Apr 2008. "The delay between the
vaccination of this dog and its entry into Belgium and then France did not
conform to the delay of one month required by these countries," noted
Eurosurveillance.org, published by the European Centre for Disease
Prevention and Control in Stockholm, Sweden. "The criterion of having had a
rabies antibody titre 3 months before entry into these countries was also
not met for this particular dog."

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was already worried
about accidental importation of rabies into the US, reported Susan
Donaldson James of ABC News Internet Ventures in October 2007. In early
2007, James recounted, "a puppy from India got a clean bill of health from
officials at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Days later, at its
destination in Alaska, the dog was diagnosed with rabies, according to
Washington's Veterinary Board of Governors. In 2004, Los Angeles saw its
1st case of rabies in 30 years, in a puppy imported from Mexico. In
Massachusetts, a dog imported from Puerto Rico was diagnosed with the disease."

Rescuers in the developing world are typically eager to move puppies out of
crowded shelters where delay increases the likelihood of exposure to
contagious ailments. Lacking quarantine facilities, they often rely on
vaccination and luck -- but the shelters receiving animals from abroad
often lack adequate quarantine space themselves. Rabies is only one of many
diseases that are easily accidentally imported before symptoms are evident
-- as Adirondack Save A Stray, of Corinth, New York, recently found after
accepting 2 puppies from Puerto Rico. "Both came down with serious cases of
potentially deadly parvovirus," wrote Schenectady Gazette reporter Stephen
Williams. "Veterinarians said a quarantine after their arrival might have
prevented their getting sick after adoption." Responded Fiel, "In rescue,
there are no guarantees. We're rescuing animals. We're saving lives."

Saratoga Springs veterinarian Charles Brockett, a regional representative
of the New York State Veterinary Medical Association, told Williams that
parvovirus takes a week to 10 days to incubate. "The ethical thing would be
to quarantine for 10 days, and eliminate any doubt," Brockett said. Fiel
objected that Adirondack Save-a-Stray is too small to hold puppies in
quarantine, if they can be adopted instead.

[Firstly, policies adjustable at the convenience and limitations of the
importing agency are irrelevant. It is patently clear that rescued animals
should be minimally subject to the same policies as other animals and
because of their inherent and patent higher risk of carrying disease they
also must be vaccinated, quarantined, and health checked. If the quality of
the pre-export quarantine in the country of origin is in doubt -- for a
start each animal has to be isolated from all others during the quarantine;
a kennel is not the same -- the quarantine will have to be invoked at the
destination country.

Secondly, this UK incident highlights the fundamental fact that it is risky
business to ship very poorly cared for animals all around the world. These
animals are compromised to begin with and we add the stress of long
distance travel, etc. If you do it enough times as a policy, incidents like
the one referred to here will probably occur. It is therefore in the best
interests of the rescue agency to have the highest standards.

Thirdly, while Merritt's arguments are good and based on many years
experience, it would appear there could be diminishing returns as more and
more animals are adopted over long distances.

Sure, at first people in the home countries will notice and be embarrassed
but after a few shipments, the publicity value will be gone and you can be
left with a policy poorly advised in epidemiological terms. If there is no
meaningful change in the care and maintenance of domestic animals in the
originating countries, all we have is a feel-good exercise. Look for a
moment at another species, orphaned, and institutionalised children and
infants. International adoption of these children has publicised their poor
care and prevalence of congenital problems in various countries. Have these
been resolved in each country? Some, yes. All? No. But the baby adoptions
continue, sometimes to the profit of the intermediaries. I suspect that
puppies and babies are more similar than we realise. - Mod.MHJ]
