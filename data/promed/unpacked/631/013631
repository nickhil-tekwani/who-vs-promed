Horse disease outbreak confirmed
--------------------------------
Racehorse trainers are on alert after a highly infectious disease was
confirmed in a horse at one of Newmarket's stables. The horse, at
trainer William Jarvis's stables in Fordham Road, has strangles -- a
disease which can restrict animals' airways and can prove fatal. The
outbreak has come just days before the start of the flat racing
season and a month before the start of racing at Newmarket.

The horse has been isolated and measures have been introduced to
reduce the risk of spreading the disease. Mr Jarvis was not available
for comment. But Mark Tompkins, chairman of the Newmarket Trainers'
Federation, said: "He has done everything right by letting everyone
know about it as early as possible. He has been absolutely brilliant.
The vets are on top of it. Let's hope it can be contained to just the
one horse. His string of horses are being tested and swabbed
constantly and he will exercise his horses in the afternoon when
no-one else is on the heath."

Experts from the Animal Health Trust, based just outside Newmarket,
are also monitoring the situation alongside Mr Jarvis's own vets. Tim
Morris, British Horseracing Authority equine science and welfare
director, confirmed the outbreak was currently limited to a single
horse. He said no restrictions were being imposed on Mr Jarvis's
horses because he had shown a responsible attitude by reporting the sickness.

The last strangles scare in racing was 5 years ago when an outbreak
was confirmed near Epsom about 10 days before the Derby. The race
went ahead as planned after precautions were put in place.
