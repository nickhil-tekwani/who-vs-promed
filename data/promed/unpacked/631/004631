[From a reliable South African source I was informed that Cape Buffalo in
the Kruger National Park had acquired _Mycobacterium bovis_ from cattle on
the park boundary and which had spread extensively through the buffalo and
then to various predator species, including lions. Various programmes,
including area slaughter of buffalo, were being considered but that the one
person who would know is Dr Leo Braack, Head/Research & Scientific
Services, KNP. So I contacted Leo, who very graciously replied as follows.

Bovine TB is a big issue in Kruger right now, and we are all set to start
on an intensive monitoring programme on 14 September (the buffalo
sampling/fieldwork that is). Below is an extract from a piece I recently
wrote as part of a submission to [the KNP Animal Use and Care Committee,
and hopefully this will give at least some idea of our basic approach. To
address your question fully would require a substantive report which I
honestly don't have the time for now nor in the foreseeable future, but I
will give you this little bit and you can request more specific answers if
need be based on that. I will also copy your request to some of our
veterinarians and ask them to add on to my own comments.
Extract follows:
>From the KNP's perspective we view BTB as an alien organism foreign to
this ecosystem. According to our mandate and management plan all alien
organisms (well, within reason, didn't quite have the flu virus in mind)
should (if possible) be eradicated or at least controlled. As you know BTB
has proven to be a particularly intractable problem which does not lend
itself easily to eradication or control. Given this difficulty to eradicate
or control and the great expense which any serious effort to eradicate or
control will cost, our concern is that we need to know what potential or
real impact BTB will have on biodiversity (it appears that nowhere in the
world is there conclusive, clear and irrefutable evidence of the impact of
BTB on wildlife populations).
It becomes a management issue because if we do find evidence of significant
impact on biodiversity (whether on buffalo populations alone as major
ecosystem components by being bulk grazers and habitat architects, or
through spill-over to other populations), then we are forced to go the
route of spending substantial amounts of money, time and effort to control
such impact. If no significant evidence of BTB impact (on populations, not
necessarily individuals) can be detected, then, because of the current
difficult nature of BTB control, we can afford to adopt a 'wait-and-see'
attitude while awaiting development of appropriate vaccines etc.
Part of the answer to our questions regarding potential impact of BTB lies
in computer modelling, and to this end we contracted in an American student
(Tim Rodwell). The model needs to be fed with credible, defensible data
however (rubbish-in, rubbish-out), and it is partly for this reason that we
wish to embark on a completely new monitoring programme with clear
objectives, standardised methodologies, enabling repeat surveys using
standardised techniques lending themselves to defensible conclusions.
You [the KNP AU&C Committee quite rightly point out that we should be
looking at population dynamics of buffalo. I wish to point out the
following:
1) The 1992 cull data and base population of buffalo were almost certainly
already affected by the severe drought of that year (the buffalo population
was effectively halved from about 28 000 to something like 14 000 due to
the drought), and we expose ourselves to all sorts of criticism if we use
that data for interpreting impacts of BTB.
2) No survey yielding adequate data necessary for the BTB model was done
after 1992 (6 years ago).
3) It seems pointless and again exposes us to all sorts of criticism and
doubt if we do not combine a buffalo population dynamics study with a BTB
prevalence study. Regrettably the BTB prevalence study requires lethal
sampling under current technology (if we are aiming at 95% confidence
levels).
4) Whether done this year or next or whenever, repeat sampling to establish
BTB prevalence and correlate it with buffalo herd dynamics will almost
certainly have to be done, so we are simply delaying what we believe to be
the inevitable. The sampling will have to be done repeatedly (every 5 or so
years) in our view to address the particular objectives of the study.
(And then skipping a bit to another part:)
The primary motivations for the proposed BTB monitoring programme are
briefly outlined below: * To establish the current prevalence and
distribution of bovine tuberculosis within the KNP: This will be done
according to a completely revised and statistically sound process, aimed
not only at providing immediate insight into what is happening with BTB
right now in the KNP, but also to provide a solid, defensible baseline
against which future surveys can be compared.
* To gain insight into the possible impact of BTB on herd structure
(differential age and sex structure) by comparing herds of different
prevalence rates: As implied earlier in this note, it appears not to have
been proven that BTB impacts substantially on biodiversity nor indeed on
the host population itself. By sampling a wide range of herds and
establishing BTB prevalence rates for these herds, then comparing age and
sex ratios for these herds, insight can be gained of the impact *if any* of
BTB on herd structure.
* If BTB affects herd age and sex structure, and potentially therefore
reproductive viability, what is the average herd prevalence rate at which
negative population growth sets in?: This question assumes a lot of
factors, but is a question which needs to be asked and the proposed
monitoring programme should aim at providing answers to this question. It
may turn out that there is no direct correlation, that reproductive
capacity is not significantly affected, or a number of other possibilities.
* To establish a mortality index to correlate extent and nature of
infection with expected mortality: It has been difficult to predict what
consequence to associate with a particular degree of BTB infection and also
to predict expected life-span of an animal with a particular degree of
infection. This insight is a basic ingredient for any computer modelling to
be successful, and will be addressed during the monitoring programme.
* To assess the rate of spread of BTB within a herd and also over
geographic distance between herds: This is essential data for planning any
control or eradication programme. This will be obtained by re-sampling
known herds (by radio-collaring) over time and comparing rates of incidence.
* To assess the efficacy of current and experimental diagnostic tests:
There does not currently exist any 100% effective or reliable test for BTB
in individual animals. Not only is this a serious problem in terms of
satisfying veterinary regulations when wishing to relocate certain animals
(rhino etc.) from BTB endemic areas, but an effective BTB test is almost
certainly essential as part of any future control or eradication programmes.
* To assess if there exists any correlation between host condition and the
extent/nature of BTB lesions: If indeed some correlation can be found
between the extent and/or nature of TB lesions and the external visual
condition of infected animals, this may be of major significance in
devising a control/eradication programme. If the heavily infected prime
sources of infection can be visually detected in wild populations, such
animals can be selectively removed and BTB dynamics sufficiently affected
to achieve control (There is a long story behind this and it would require
a bit of background, don't just broadside [attack this statement at face
value).
I'm reluctant to make detailed comment on TB in lions because that is part
of a current study being handled by the State Veterinarians. Prevalence is
by no means anywhere near 100% in the general lion population, but in a
very select sample of 35 highly emaciated or otherwise highly suspect
individuals the prevalence of TB approached 90%. I would be grateful if you
could approach Dr Dewald Keet directly about this issue.
Hope this helps at least a little.

[I am trying to contact Keet for his comments on lions. However, the KNP
problems with BTB are parallel but possibly more severe and certainly more
challenging than those involving elk & bison in North America. A classmate
of mine, Chris Groocock, woke up in the Nairobi morgue after meeting with a
Cape Buffalo cow; fortunately he lived to tell the tale. To keep the
annoyance to a minimum, may I suggest that anyone with questions for Leo
Braack should pass them to me; I will bulk them together and pass them to
Leo, who can then knock them off at one sitting, hopefully. - Mod.MHJ
