Emergence of resistance to oseltamivir among influenza A(H1N1) viruses in
Europe
-----------------------------------------------
Surveillance of the antiviral susceptibility of influenza viruses
circulating in Europe has been established since 2004 through the European
Union-funded European Surveillance Network for Vigilance against Viral
Resistance (VIRGIL), in collaboration with the European Influenza
Surveillance Scheme (EISS), the World Health Organization (WHO) and
national influenza centres. Results from analysis of early winter (Nov
2007-Jan 2008) A(H1N1) virus isolates has revealed that a significant
proportion, about 14 per cent of these European strains are resistant to
oseltamivir (Tamiflu), the most widely used anti-influenza drug, but retain
sensitivity to zanamivir (Relenza) and amantadine/rimantadine. [These data
are tabulated in the original text.]

As of week 03/2008, 16 European countries have reported significant
influenza activity (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Hungary, Ireland,
Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Northern Ireland, Poland, Portugal, Romania,
Slovenia, Spain, and Switzerland). Of the total virus detections since week
40/2007 (N=3447), 81 per cent have been influenza A and 19 per cent
influenza B, and the predominant viruses circulating in most countries have
been A(H1N1) similar to the A/Solomon Islands/ 3/2007 vaccine strain [1].
The presence of oseltamivir-resistant viruses circulating in the community
in several European countries (Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, and United Kingdom) is in marked
contrast to the previous winter seasons of 2004/2005, 2005/2006, and
2006/2007, when oseltamivir resistance was detected in <1 per cent of
circulating strains from 24 countries.

A total of 437 influenza A(H1N1) viruses, isolated between November 2007
and January 2008, were tested using measurement of neuraminidase (NA)
enzyme activity in the presence of oseltamivir to determine the
drug-sensitivity (IC50) of the viral enzyme (2) in conjunction with
sequence analysis of the viral neuraminidase gene. To date,
oseltamivir-resistant viruses have been detected in 9 countries; in
particular, 26 of 37 (70 per cent) in Norway, 15 of 87 (17 per cent) in
France, 3 of 43 (7.0 per cent) in Germany and 8 of 162 (5 per cent) in the
United Kingdom carry the same mutation, causing the substitution of
histidine by tyrosine at residue 274 (H274Y) of the neuraminidase, which is
known to confer a high level resistance to oseltamivir. Viruses bearing
this mutation, when tested in enzyme assays, showed a reduction of
approximately 400 fold in susceptibility to oseltamivir (IC50 values
increased from approximately 1nM to more than 400nM). All these viruses
remain sensitive to the other anti-neuraminidase drug zanamivir and to the
anti-M2 drugs amantadine and rimantadine.

The resistant (H274Y) viruses have been isolated from both adults and
children, ranging from one month to 61 years in age, with the majority of
viruses being isolated from adults. So far, there is no information that
any of these viruses, in any country, has been obtained from a person who
has either been treated or been in close contact with another individual
who has been treated with oseltamivir. We therefore conclude that the
identification of these oseltamivir-resistant viruses as a substantial
proportion of circulating viruses, particularly in Norway, is the 1st clear
evidence that influenza A(H1N1) virus with the H274Y mutation can readily
transmit between individuals.

More extensive surveillance within Europe and in other parts of the world
is required to establish the relative prevalence and geographical
distribution of these resistant viruses and to evaluate their potential
impact on the effectiveness of drug use. The spectrum of clinical illness
associated with infection by oseltamivir-resistant viruses remains to be
fully determined, although limited information from initial clinical cases
does not suggest unusual disease syndromes. Although the resistant viruses
have been isolated from November [2007] through January [2008], the ability
of these viruses to persist throughout the influenza season, and from one
season to the next, will require continuous worldwide surveillance by the
WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network. Determining the origins and
genesis of these drug-resistant strains, which appear to have emerged in
regions of the world where there is little drug pressure, will be important
in understanding the emergence and persistence of oseltamivir resistance in
relation to the evolution of influenza viruses and drug use.

[18 countries in Europe (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Hungary,
Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Northern Ireland, Poland, Portugal,
Romania, Slovenia, Spain, and Switzerland) are now reporting isolation of
oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 influenza viruses from patients.
Oseltamivir-resistance in all cases examined so far is determined by
substitution of histidine by tyrosine at residue 274 (H274Y) in the viral
neuraminidase. Interestingly, all these oseltamivir-resistant viruses
remain sensitive to the other anti-neuraminidase drug zanamivir (Relenza).
The oseltamivir-resistant viruses so far have not been associated with any
unusual disease syndrome. - Mod.CP]
