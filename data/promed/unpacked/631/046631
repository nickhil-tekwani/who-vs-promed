State and local health officials are investigating a cluster of
food-borne infections that sickened 7 people in 3 Texas counties this
year, killing 2 of them.

The patients -- 5 from Bexar County and one each from Travis and
Hidalgo counties -- developed listeriosis, a bacterial infection.
_Listeria monocytogenes_ bacteria are found widely in the
environment, including vegetables and animals. Outbreaks are
sometimes linked to foods such as soft cheeses and deli meats
contaminated after processing.

Genetic analysis found the identical strain of bacteria in all the
patients, suggesting they were infected by the same food item, said
Roger Sanchez, senior epidemiologist with the Metropolitan Health
District. But because of the small numbers and the dispersal of cases
-- 2 of the patients lived 300 miles apart -- it might be difficult
to pinpoint the cause, he added.

"This is not a large outbreak. What made it bad is that it has
infected people who are fragile, elderly people," Sanchez said.

Most healthy people aren't in danger from listeriosis though they
sometimes experience flu-like symptoms. But in the elderly, pregnant
women and people whose immune systems are weakened by illness, the
fatality rate from the infection can reach 20 percent. The Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that 2500 become
seriously ill each year with listeriosis, and 500 of them die.

Sanchez said the infected patients ranged from ages 66 to 93. Most
had serious underlying health problems, and all but one were
hospitalized either before or during their infection. The 1st case
was reported in January 2010, the most recent 6 May 2010.

On Monday [10 May 2010], the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued a
public health alert for deli meats imported from Canada and produced
by Ontario-based Zadi Foods. The products were prosciutto sold under
the brands Casa Italia and Emma. A 2008 outbreak in Canada linked to
another deli meat producer killed 22 people out of 57 who became ill.
A number of Texas cases in recent years have been traced to
unpasteurized soft, white cheese from Mexico.

"Deli meats are implicated a lot because the bacteria can multiply in
refrigerator temperatures," unlike most other forms of bacteria, Sanchez said.

Symptoms of listeriosis can include fever, muscle aches, nausea and
diarrhea. If the infection spreads to the nervous system, it can
cause headaches, confusion, vertigo and convulsions.

To reduce the risk of listeriosis, people are advised to thoroughly
cook raw meat and wash raw vegetables before eating, keep raw meats
separate from vegetables and other cooked or ready-to-eat foods, and
wash hands, knives and cutting boards afterward.

For those at highest risk of serious illness, such as the elderly or
pregnant women, experts recommend avoiding hot dogs or luncheon meats
unless reheated until steaming hot, avoiding soft cheeses unless the
label states they're made from pasteurized milk, and avoiding
refrigerated meat spreads and cold smoked seafood unless it is an
ingredient in a cooked dish.

[In 2008, ProMED reported a Canadian deli-meat associated outbreak of
listeriosis that involved 20 deaths (Listeriosis, fatal, meat product
- Canada (04) 20081005.3147). The _Listeria_ bacterium was found deep
inside slicing equipment, according to company officials at Maple
Leaf Foods plant, Canada's biggest food company.

On 16 Mar 2010, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and
Inspection Service (FSIS) issued a public health alert for various
imported ready-to-eat deli meat products (prosciutto), produced by
Siena Foods LTD (located in Ontario) because of _Listeria_
contamination (see ProMED post Listeriosis, fatal, meat product -
Canada: (ON) 20100314.0829 and
<http://www.fsis.usda.gov/News/NR_031610_01/index.asp>).

On 10 May 2010, the FSIS issued another alert for various imported
ready-to-eat prosciutto products, produced this time by Zadi Foods
Ltd (also located in Ontario), because they may be contaminated with
_Listeria monocytogenes _
(<http://www.fsis.usda.gov/News_&_Events/NR_051010_02/index.asp>).

Previously on 1 May 2010, FSIS recalled fully cooked crumbled pork
sausage products, produced by Custom Corned Beef, Inc., (located
Denver, CO) that may have been contaminated with _Listeria
monocytogenes_
(<http://www.fsis.usda.gov/News_&_Events/Recall_027_2010_Release/index.asp>).
It is not stated in the news release above whether the DNA
fingerprint of the strain of _Listeria moncytogenes_ isolated from
the patients in Texas matched any of the strains isolated from these
various culture-positive food products.

Most human _Listeria monocytogenes_ infections are food-borne,
although vertical transmission can occur from mother to fetus
transplacentally or during delivery through an infected birth canal,
and localized skin infections can occur in veterinarians and farmers
by direct contact with infected animals.

Contamination of food can occur in nature, such as, raw vegetables
contaminated by soil and manure, and raw milk from infected cows; or
contamination may occur following subsequent cooking or other
processing. Because the organisms can multiply at refrigerator
temperatures, it is not surprising that listeriosis is usually
associated with ingestion of contaminated milk, meat or vegetable
products that have been held at refrigeration temperatures.

Since listeria in raw food would be killed during cooking, the risk
of listeriosis is usually greatest from ready-to-eat products; that
is, food that will not be further cooked before eating. Listeriosis
is more severe in newborns, pregnant women, people 60 years of age or
older, and those with compromised immune defenses. A detailed
discussion of listeriosis can be found in ProMED-mail post 20071230.4186.

Travis County is part of the city of Austin metropolitan area. Austin
is the capital of the U.S. state of Texas and is located in Central
Texas. San Antonio, the county seat of Bexar County, is located 80
miles to the southwest of Austin. Hidalgo County is located on the
Rio Grande River at the border with Mexico.
