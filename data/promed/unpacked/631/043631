HANTAVIRUSES - BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA (10)
======================================
Subject: Hantan Virus-- BH
In response to posting #5 on this subject -- The work was reportedly
done by the Microbiology laboratory at the Tuzla Hospital, with
assistance from the Swedish National Microbiology Laboratory. I do
not know if Dobrova virus was included in the screen. On the
question as to whether or not NATO Forces have antivirals available
for treatment, I have no idea except for US forces. US forces do have
these medications available.
