Influenza update - 326 (based on data up to 30 Sep 2018)
----------------------------------------
Information in this report is categorized by influenza transmission zones, which are geographical groups of countries, areas, or territories with similar influenza transmission patterns.

Summary
------
In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity appeared to decrease overall, though influenza percent positivity remained elevated in southern Africa. In Australia and New Zealand, influenza activity remained at low levels and even below seasonal threshold during the entire season. Increased influenza detections were reported in some countries of southern and southeast Asia. In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, influenza activity remained at interseasonal levels. Worldwide, seasonal influenza subtype A viruses accounted for the majority of detections.

National influenza centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 95 countries, areas, or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 17 Sep 2018 to 30 Sep 2018 (data as of 12 Oct 2018 03:45:25 UTC). The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 58 772 specimens during that time period. 2124 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 1789 (84.2%) were typed as influenza A and 335 (15.8%) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 1051 (74%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and 369 (26%) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 51 (49%) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 53 (51%) to the B-Victoria lineage.

The WHO Consultation and Information Meeting on the Composition of Influenza Virus Vaccines for Use in the 2019 Southern Hemisphere Influenza Season was held on 24-26 Sep 2018 in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. It was recommended that trivalent vaccines contain the following: an A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus; an A/Switzerland/8060/2017 (H3N2)-like virus; and a B/Colorado/06/2017-like virus (B/Victoria/2/87 lineage). It was also recommended that quadrivalent vaccines containing 2 influenza B viruses contain the above 3 viruses and a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage).

[Influenza activity is overall decreased and at interseasonal levels in southern and northern hemispheres, respectively; in the reporting period, influenza A predominated, and the majority of the reported subtypes were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. No novel influenza viruses were reported. - Mod.UBA]
