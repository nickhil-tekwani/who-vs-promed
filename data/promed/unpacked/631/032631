Screwworm infecting Key deer also found in some sick pets
---------------------------------------------------------
It's not just the Key deer being ravaged by a flesh-eating worm in the Florida Keys. Pets are also starting to turn up with gruesome infections.

While wildlife managers have focused largely on the endangered herd and the 107 deer killed since August [2016], vets say they have treated at least 9 suspected cases in dogs, cats, rabbits, pigs and a tortoise. Two feral cats had to be euthanized, said Marathon Veterinary Hospital's Doug Mader. Those numbers are higher than the 3 reported by the Florida Department of Agriculture, which only counts cases confirmed in lab tests, largely because of the confirmation process.

"That's the tough part about this whole thing. You look at them and it walks like a duck, but you have to have confirmation that it's a duck," said Keys Animal Hospital veterinarian Kyle Maddox, who treated an infected dog earlier this month [October 2016].

The discrepancy in numbers, and expanded war on the screwworm that now covers 8 islands and this week drew a new team of volunteers fanning out with medicated bread to feed deer, has only increased anxiety among pet owners. Vets, however, stress the risk to pets remains far lower than the peril posed to the wild deer.

Residents in the Middle Keys and staff at the National Key Deer Refuge 1st reported seeing deer with gory injuries in August [2016] as the herd's rutting season kicked off. Males typically turn up with head and neck wounds, but when the injuries appeared to fester and deer began dying, staff started collecting samples. On 20 Sep 2016 they confirmed the herd, the last remaining on the planet, was infected with the 1st U.S. screwworm outbreak in 30 years. By then, residents were already finding deer cowering in garages and under porches.

"We put out the fly trap bags and were just catching oodles of flies," said Susan Rich, a real estate agent in Big Pine who fled with her 2 dogs, a yorkie and fox terrier, to her Key West house after finding a wounded deer in her garage. "I thought it had eaten rat poison. It was just so scary until we found out what it really was, and that was even more frightening."

Meanwhile, pets started appearing with wounds. Beginning in late August, Mader treated a rabbit that likely had a screwworm infection, followed by 2 pigs, 2 cats and 3 dogs. He also treated a tortoise likely infected.

In past years, it's not been uncommon for pet wounds to get infected with other kinds of maggots, he said. "We see that a few times a year. But we saw it a lot this summer and that's when the deer started showing up positive. That's when we put 2 and 2 together that something more was going on."

In the weeks since, the rising number of ghastly deer deaths have left people shaken. On Friday [21 Oct 2016], Maddox said he had 4 appointments with pet owners wanting information about the flies.

"It's almost like walking zombie deer, like something out of a bad movie," Mader said.

While refuge staff have begun treating deer with a prophylactic medicine that can protect them against screwworm infections, no such drug exists for pets. But vets and wildlife biologists say the risk among pets monitored by owners is much lower than wild animals, as long as pets are checked at least 2 times daily for wounds. If they do find sores, owners need to cover the wounds or keep animals indoors. An infected soar will contain white rice-like pieces. The eggs generally hatch in about 21 hours, which is why it's important to check twice daily.

"The single best thing people can do is monitor their pets and monitor them for wounds," Maddox said.

Screwworms, which look like house flies with large orange eyes, will only lay their eggs in warm, living tissue. (Reptiles are excluded from the federal lists of affected animals, but Mader said fellow vets in South America where screwworms remain a problem routinely find iguanas and other cold-blooded reptiles infected because temperatures remain so warm.) When the eggs hatch, the larvae feed on the tissue, causing severe pain as the maggots burrow deeper. When they are ready to pupate after about 6 days, the maggots drop to the ground, allowing them to easily spread to other animals.

Thousands of larvae can infect animals. Maddox said the dog he treated earlier this month had hundreds of maggots that had eaten away a good bit of the dog's foot. And despite some anecdotal evidence that doubling up on heartworm and other medicines could fend off the flies, no scientific studies have confirmed the effectiveness, he said.

"If [pet owners] can just be vigilant, their pet is not really at high risk," he said. "It's these animals that develop wounds and are not being monitored."

That includes a large feral cat population in the islands, which live outside and go unchecked. The Keys Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals delivered a sick cat that was unmarked to Mader on Thursday [20 Oct 2016], but could not determine whether it belonged to one of the feral colonies.

"It was the worst case we've seen," he said. "Someone found it dying in a backyard, full of screwworms."

SPCA officials say they've been trying to contact colony managers -- an unofficial group of advocates who try to track the cats -- to provide help, urging them to check cats at least twice a day.

"More times is better. As many times as you can check and have your hands on them. And if you see an open wound consult your vet immediately," said executive director Tammy Fox. The same goes to anyone who spots a wounded stray animal. "Contact the Marathon campus or the Key West campus [of the SPCA] so we can try to help."

The outbreak initially overwhelmed the small staff at the refuge. Residents say calls for help sometimes took too long and not enough was being done to treat the imperiled deer, whose numbers dropped to about 25 before they were added to the endangered species list in 1957. An early plan to control the outbreak with sterile male flies -- a method that helped wipe out the flies in the U.S. in the 1950s and 60s -- was expanded this week to include treating deer with doramectin and administering antibiotics to sick deer, even though refuge staff say the fragile deer rarely do well under their care.

A team of 20 refuge volunteers has also begun feeding deer bread laced with the doramectin and marking them with paint. By Thursday afternoon, about 50 deer had been treated and will be retreated weekly, said ranger Kristie Killam.

"People are going to see [volunteers] doing things we've spent 50 years telling them not to do: feeding the deer," she said.

The teams are focusing on Big Pine and No Name keys, but will likely expand as more volunteers are trained, she said.

A quarantine is now in effect for much of the island, from the south border of Key Largo to Key West, with a highway checkpoint at mile marker 106 requiring an inspection of any animal being moved. Since the 1st week of October [2016], more than 1200 pets have been checked -- including 1176 dogs, 35 cats, 4 horses, 6 birds and 1 rabbit. No infections have been found. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has also expanded the release of sterile flies to mate with wild female flies and contain the outbreak to 8 islands from No Name Key west to Summerland.

With the snowbird season around the corner, Mader and Rich both say they are getting lots of questions from seasonal residents who frequently bring pets.

"We've had people calling and saying 'I'm not coming,'" Mader said. "We want people to be educated, but not afraid. I have 2 dogs that live outside and I don't worry about them. But I do check them twice a day."

Key deer get medicine for screwworm
-----------------------------------
Even though the Key deer death toll had risen to 107 as of Friday [21 Oct 2016], a bit of good news arrived this week.

Officers at the National Key Deer Refuge on Big Pine Key have begun treating as many deer possible with doramectin, an antiparasitic medicine that serves as a preventive measure and treatment for New World screwworm.

After receiving a dose of doramectin on a piece of bread, the deer are marked with nontoxic paint in a specific color for the day they're treated. A week after their 1st dose, since each one lasts 7 days, officers will try to administer more treatments.

U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officers worked with wildlife veterinarians to evaluate and select treatments as soon as the screwworm infestation was confirmed on Big Pine Key and No Name Key on 30 Sep 2016.

Screwworms have since been confirmed on Summerland Key by entomologists with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and screwworm flies have been found on Big Torch, Middle Torch, Little Torch, Cudjoe and Ramrod keys.

Screwworm flies lay their eggs in open wounds where larvae hatch and feed, basically eating the deer alive. Many of the deer wounds are believed to come from rutting -- males battling each other for mates. So far, only 6 of the deer euthanized have been female.

The Key deer population was estimated at about 1000 before the deaths and euthanizations of infected deer started. The deer, just 3 feet high, are found only in the Florida Keys and are on the Endangered Species List.

Katie Watts, lead biologist at the refuge, said many people have asked her what took so long to start treating the infested deer.

"There are many things we have to consider with the application of a chemical. That's why it takes so much time," she said, adding there are 23 other endangered species in the refuge in addition to the Key deer. The use of pesticides on refuge lands is strictly regulated, so threats to other wildlife were considered.

After a deer is euthanized with a bolt gun, the carcass is frozen for a few days, killing all the screwworm maggots and flies. Then the body is incinerated.

Watts said she hopes the community will continue observing the deer for odd behavior or wounds and that it's going to be a community effort to eradicate the screwworm. Sterile male screwworms continue to be released to mate with female flies as well, a successful method created by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the 1960s.

The Fish and Wildlife Service is looking for volunteers to help prepare food with doramectin that is given to the deer or hand out flyers to the public. Those interested should email Kristie Killam, park ranger, at <keydeer@fws.gov>. Also, Watts encouraged the public to drive slowly through Big Pine Key and to call (305) 470-6863 extension 7 if they see an infected Key deer.

[It seemed odd they would treat the screwworm infection with antibiotics, other than to combat secondary bacterial infection. However, it seems likely the 1st few articles may have confused antibiotics with anitparasiticides.

Dormectin is an avermectin class of antiparasiticide. Ivermectin is in this same class. Ivermectin is given orally to horses and under this premise dormectin has been shown to have approximately the same biological availability and efficacy. This may be a good choice for the deer and especially if they find the bread with dormectin on it to be palatable. It is sad it only has 7 days protection, but there is something. Hopefully between the sterile flies and the dormectin the deer can be saved and the infestation stopped.

Pet owners and livestock owners need to be checking their animals several times a day to protect them against infection. - Mod.TG
