Keeping up with a state-declared epidemic, Shasta County has had 4 times as many whooping cough cases, so far this year [2014], than it did during the same period of 2013. "We're definitely having an upswing of whooping cough in Shasta County," said Andrew Deckert, the county's public health officer.

While the 28 cases reported so far this year [2014] are quadruple the 7 cases in 2013, and even further from the mere 2 cases the county saw in 2012, health officials weren't caught too off-guard because the disease is cyclical, meaning it tends to have a steep uptick every 3 to 5 years. For example, 2010 saw 32 cases in the same time period in Shasta County, Deckert said.

In Tehama County, there also has been a massive uptick this year [2014], with 38 reported cases to 2013's zero, according to CDPH data.

Despite the cyclical nature of the illness, the sharp rise in cases is pushing local health officials to remind the public to get vaccinated for the airborne illness that's also known as pertussis. "Having the disease is absolutely miserable, and I inspire you to get caught up and current on your Tdap [tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis] ... for your own preservation," Lloyd Braemer, a pediatrician at Mercy Medical Center, said of the 2nd anti-whooping cough shot people are supposed to get after the DtaP shot as young children.

The vaccines, however, aren't required if parents object to them over philosophical or religious beliefs in California. So while the shot is technically considered mandatory for schoolchildren, it really isn't in California, since parents who object can use a "personal belief exemption" form to avoid shots for their children. A full 10 percent of 7th-grade students and 8.56 percent of kindergarten students in Shasta County got a belief exemption in the last school year -- a rise from the year before, according to California Department of Public Health.

"Personal belief exemptions definitely have an impact, not only on whooping cough, but other childhood diseases, as well," said Valerie Lucero, executive director of the Tehama County Health Services Agency.

In addition to vaccines, there also are preventive antibiotics people can take up to 21 days after suspected exposure to the bacteria.

The incubation period for the bacterium that causes the illness is 5 to 21 days, Deckert said, after which people start showing general cold symptoms such as coughing and sneezing. But pertussis takes on a life of its own after a while, with the cough becoming so severe that it can induce vomiting or break patients' ribs and last for months.

The illness isn't just unpleasant -- it can be deadly, especially for infants, the youngest of whom can't be vaccinated, and is incredibly infectious ["contagious" is the appropriate descriptor here, rather than "infectious"; see below] compared to more common ailments such as the flu. For example, Deckert said each person with the flu generally infects one to 2 other people, but every pertussis patient infects another 12 to 17 people. "It's a huge difference -- much more infectious than the flu," Deckert said.

The illness has hospitalized 288 people statewide, so far this year [2014], including 68 intensive-care stays, according to the California Department of Public Health. There also have been 3 deaths, so far in 2014, though 2 of those happened in children who contracted the illness in 2013. All told, 8278 people statewide have contracted the disease, so far this year, compared to 1249 in roughly the same period last year.

Braemer said he hasn't seen many cases of whooping cough this year [2014]. "I kept waiting for it. I haven't seen squat," Braemer said. But, he said, it's also not the holiday season yet, when people traveling to more populous areas are likely to bring the illness back with them. "I would think the travel time at Thanksgiving is going to be clinically relevant to rapidly spreading the pertussis disease, because we don't need to fly anywhere to get the heavy-hitters -- we just need to drive to the greater regions of California," he said.

For information on [Shasta] county's shot clinics, call 530-225-5591. In Tehama County, call 530-527-6824. Whooping cough vaccines are recommended for everyone 6 weeks old and older, including pregnant women in their 3rd trimester, regardless of whether they were vaccinated earlier.

[The term "infectious" refers to the ability of an organism to cause disease, while "contagious" refers to its ability to spread from person to person. Some organisms can be infectious without being contagious.

There were 7980 cases of pertussis in California reported statewide as of the 3rd week in September (2014), according to a news report posted recently by ProMED-mail (Pertussis - USA (19): (CA) increasing incidence, update 20140921.2792202). There are now 8278 cases statewide so far this year, compared to 1249 in the same period last year (2013), according to the news report above.

Pertussis has been on the increase throughout most of the world. This has been attributed in part to increased virulence and other genetic changes in the circulating clones of _Bordetella pertussis_, as well as waning or an ineffective immune response after vaccination. For a discussion of these problems, see moderator LL's comments in prior ProMED-mail posts on pertussis and moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post Pertussis - USA (04): (MT, CA) increased incidence 20140424.2426383.

In the US, DTaP and Tdap vaccines are used for pertussis immunization (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pertussis/default.htm#vacc). DTaP is given to children younger than 7 years of age, and Tdap is given to older children and adults. Children should get 5 doses of DTaP, one dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15 through 18 months and 4 through 6 years. Adolescents 11 through 18 years of age (preferably at age 11-12 years) should receive a single dose of Tdap. One dose of Tdap is also recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent. Expectant mothers should receive Tdap during each pregnancy, preferably at 27 through 36 weeks. Tdap should also be given to 7-10 year olds who are not fully immunized against pertussis. (Upper-case letters in these abbreviations denote full-strength doses of diphtheria (D) and tetanus (T) toxoids and pertussis (P) vaccine. Lower-case "d" and "p" denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent/adult-formulations. The "a" in DTaP and Tdap stands for "acellular," meaning that the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism.)

Antibiotic post exposure prophylaxis is used in all asymptomatic household contacts within 21 days of onset of cough in the index patient with pertussis and in persons within 21 days of exposure who are at high risk of developing severe pertussis and in persons who will have close contact with those at high risk of developing severe pertussis such as infants aged less than 12 months and women in their 3rd trimester of pregnancy, immunocompromised persons, and patients with moderate to severe medically treated asthma (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/outbreaks/PEP.html). - Mod.ML
