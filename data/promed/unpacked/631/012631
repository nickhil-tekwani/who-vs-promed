[1] Outbreak continues

Several children living in camps in Saraf Umra locality, North Darfur, died from a hitherto unidentified disease that has spread among the population [beginning] 2 months ago. 10 infected people died in a single week.

The coordinator of camps in Saraf Umra, Sheikh Abdelrazeg Yousif Suleiman, told Radio Dabanga yesterday that 7 of the 10 dead in the Dankoj and Jebel camps were children. The symptoms of the disease, he said, are swellings on the body, a high fever, diarrhoea, vomiting, and pain in the joints.

"There are many cases in the Saraf Umra hospital, but no statistics on the number of deaths throughout the locality," the coordinator said. He criticised the hospital doctors for not identifying or notifying the state Ministry of Health about the disease, demanding the deployment of medical teams in order to investigate the infections and provide medicines.

A month ago, Suleiman reported the outbreak of the unknown disease and a shortage of medicines, that has made their prices soar. He said that 4 children and an elderly man died, and more than 12 others had confirmed infections in September [2015].

The disease initially appeared at Jayeen Thilo and Subyan Khavo west of Saraf Umra town, and Melessa and Numera villages east of Saraf Umra. It appeared in the 1st week of September after heavy rains, an accumulation of water, and the spread of mosquitoes.

Medicines from WHO, Unamid
--------------------------
A delegation of World Health Organization (WHO) and AU-UN Mission in Darfur (Unamid) employees visited 1 of the camps in Saraf Umra recently. "They told the sheikhs there that they brought the Saraf Umra hospital medicines, to be distributed among the displaced people. The hospital's administration, however, refused to distribute these medicines," the coordinator claimed. "We were surprised to find them back on pharmacy shelves in markets in Saraf Umra."

[The situation in Darfur remains confusing. There is little doubt that there is an outbreak of hemorrhagic disease. However, attributing these cases to West Nile (WN) virus infection in the previous ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20151102.3760440), raises significant questions, because WN fever is not a hemorrhagic disease, and the number of deaths in such a short period of time is not compatible with West Nile virus outbreaks. However, the above report does not mention West Nile virus infections.

Mod.ML commented concerning previous cases, "Hemorrhagic fever can be caused by a variety of viruses that have been known to occur in Sudan. Viral hemorrhagic fever [VHF] can be caused by 4 distinct viral families: arenaviruses (Lassa fever virus), filoviruses (Ebola virus and Marburg virus), bunyaviruses (hantaviruses that cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome [HFRS], Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever [CCHF] virus, Rift Valley fever virus), and flaviviruses (dengue, yellow fever). Most VHFs are zoonoses and the viruses are usually geographically restricted to the areas where their host species live. Certain bacterial infections can also cause hemorrhagic fever, such as scrub typhus, leptospirosis, and plague."

One hopes that the WHO team will help to clarify the situation in Darfur. Submission of duplicate samples to a regional reference laboratory, such as the Pasteur Institute Laboratory in Senegal, would be helpful.

[2] Alternative etiology
Date: Mon 2 Nov 2015
From: Fons Van Gompel <FVGompel@itg.be> [edited]


To complete the list [of etiological agents] made by the moderator: "Certain bacterial infections can also cause hemorrhagic fever, such as scrub typhus, leptospirosis, and plague", at the end of 1998/beginning of 1999 there was a mysterious epidemic in parts of South Sudan with hemorrhagic features and high fatality rate. It turned out to be a relapsing fever caused by _Borrelia recurrentis_ transmitted by body lice. See ProMED-mail post of 11 May 1999 Borreliosis, relapsing fever - Sudan (south) (04) [archive no.19990511.0767] and earlier posts from 22 Oct 1998 on "acute respiratory syndrome - Sudan" [archive no.19981022.2074], followed by posts with varying titles -- for example, "yellow fever, suspected", "undiagnosed deaths".

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Van Gompel for bringing up these earlier reports of outbreaks in Sudan. Certainly the possibility of relapsing fever caused by _Borrelia recurrentis_ should be considered as a possibility in this undiagnosed outbreak. A definitive diagnosis of these cases is needed urgently, as fatalities continue. Until a reliable diagnosis is established, prevention and appropriate treatment of cases will not be possible. One hopes that the WHO team currently operating in the area will help to determine the situation on the ground and to get appropriate samples to reference laboratories, including those outside the country. - Mod.TY
