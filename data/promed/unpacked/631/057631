Annually the incidence of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome
(HFRS) in the Republic of Udmurtia is up to 10 times higher than the
average figure for the whole of Russia, according to Rospotrebnadzor
(Federal Service for Consumer Protection and Human Welfare). Annually
about 2000 people contract HFRS in the Republic. Human fatalities can
also result from this infection. The main vector of the infection is
the bank vole (_Myodes glareolus_), which migrates into human
habitats with the onset of colder weather. Rospotrebnadzor recommends
rodent extermination and enhanced hygiene as the only protective
measures against this infection.

[The Republic of Udmurtia is a sovereign republic within the Russian
Federation. It is situated in the Western part of the Middle Urals
between the Kama and Vyatka rivers. Izhevsk is the capital of the
Republic. The location of Udmurtia can be seen on the map at
<http://www.udm.ru/geograph.html>. The climate is temperate
continental with cold winters and rather warm summers. The Republic
has extensive tracts of forest.

Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a group of clinically
similar illnesses caused by hantaviruses belonging to the family
_Bunyaviridae_. Hantaviruses are carried and transmitted by rodents.
People can become infected with these viruses and develop HFRS after
exposure to aerosolized urine, droppings, or saliva of infected
rodents or after exposure to dust from their nests. Transmission may
also occur when infected urine or these other materials are directly
introduced into broken skin or onto the mucous membranes of the eyes,
nose, or mouth. In addition, individuals who work with live rodents
can be exposed to hantaviruses through rodent bites from infected
animals. Transmission from one human to another may occur, but is
extremely rare.
