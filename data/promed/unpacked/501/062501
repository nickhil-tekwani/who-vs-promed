The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health
(SCFCAH) is meeting today [Friday 14 Oct] at the Centre
Borschette. The Committee is expected to approve the
Commission proposal on preventive measures announced by
Commissioner Kyprianou, which includes a requirement for
member states to reduce the possible risk of contact between
wild birds from poultry in high-risk areas such as wetlands
or other areas known to be frequented by migratory birds.
Each member state will define which areas are at risk and
apply the necessary measures to separate wild birds from
poultry. Where necessary, this could include keeping poultry
indoors in high-risk areas. The Commission will need to be
informed on the way that member states apply the preventive
measures. The criteria and risk factors to be considered are
still being discussed with the member states in the SCFCAH
and will be further developed today when experts on
migratory routes, wild birds and hunting will be attending
the SCFCAH. Once approved by the SCFCAH, formal adoption of
the decision by the Commission will then take some days.
Regarding the further tests on the samples from Romania, the
dispatch of the samples to the Community Reference
Laboratory has been delayed due to customs procedures which
come into play for the transport of 'dangerous material'.
The samples are now expected to arrive at the Community
Reference Laboratory late on Fri 14 Oct 2005 and so results
can only be expected by Sat 15 Oct 2005 afternoon, not
before. Once the results are known, an esPRESSo will be
issued.

[The delay in the transport of the suspected samples from
Romania to the reference laboratory in Weybridge, apparently
due to customs/security procedures, is unfortunate and
should be prevented in future.
The following news release was published later, on 14 Oct
2005. - Mod.AS]

The Member States today endorsed unanimously the reinforced
measures proposed by the European Commission to reduce the
risk of introducing avian influenza into EU poultry farms.
The measures focus on strengthening biosecurity measures on
farms and introducing early detection systems in high risk
areas such as wetlands or farms along migratory flyways. The
decision will now be adopted by the European Commission in
the coming days. The Standing Committee on the Food Chain
and Animal Health also agreed a statement which is annexed
below.
The biosecurity measures require the member states to take
the appropriate measures, according to national
circumstances, to reduce the risk of avian influenza being
spread from wild birds to domestic birds. In particularly
high risk areas, this could include keeping poultry indoors.
Common EU-wide risk factors were agreed as criteria for
applying these measures, for example the location of farms
along migratory flyways, the distance of holdings from wet
areas where migratory waterfowl may gather and the keeping
of poultry or other domesticated birds in open-air farms.
Risk factors for the spread of avian influenza within or
between holdings include areas with a high density of
poultry holdings or where there is much movement between
holdings. Health checks on poultry holdings must integrate
the requirements set out in the Decision.
The early detection systems aim to ensure that any sign of
avian influenza in poultry or other captive birds are
rapidly reported by the owners or keepers to the national
competent veterinary authority. Specific criteria are set
out (for example a drop in egg production or increased
mortality rates) to alert farmers to the signs indicating
that they need to inform the authorities.
Each member state is responsible for identifying the high
risk areas in their territory and ensuring that the
appropriate measures to separate wild birds from
domesticated birds are implemented as soon as possible. The
member states are required to inform the European Commission
of the measures taken before 5 Nov 2005.
The Commission continues to follow the situation in Turkey,
Romania, and Bulgaria closely. In addition to the 3 experts
sent to Romania, 2 experts (one epidemiologist and one
laboratory expert) are being sent to Turkey and Bulgaria
respectively to evaluate the situation in these countries.
Their mission will begin on Mon 17 Oct 2005 and will last
until Thu 20 Oct 2005. In Turkey, the experts will evaluate
the situation on the ground in the affected areas and assist
their counterparts in the Turkish laboratories. In Bulgaria,
the experts will assist their counterparts in the
laboratories and offer other assistance and advice as needed
on the ground.
The Commission has asked member states to forward it the
names of experts who can be made available should further
technical assistance be needed by countries affected by
avian influenza outbreaks.
