--------------------------------------------------------------
In his comment, Moderator CP is wondering whether particular procedures could possibly favour transmission of hepatitis C virus [HCV] from a health care worker to female patients. Alternatively, it may be the concentration of infectious virus which may be up to 10 (to the power of 6) or more per ml shortly after infection before the appearance of specific antibody and may be drastically reduced to 10 (to the power of 2) per ml after the appearance of the antibody. Thus it would be interesting to know whether all 4 HCV-positive women were infected within a short time period.
