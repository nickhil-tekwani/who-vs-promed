Regional update, pandemic (H1N1) 2009
-------------------------------------
The information contained within this update is obtained from data
provided by Ministries of Health of Member States and National
Influenza Centers through reports sent to Pan American Health
Organization (PAHO) or updates on their web pages.

Weekly summary
--------------
- In South America, Colombia and Peru reported an increasing trend of
acute respiratory disease.
- In Central America, El Salvador reported an increasing trend in
acute respiratory disease.
- In the Caribbean, Dominica reported an increasing trend in acute
respiratory disease.
- In North America, acute respiratory disease activity remained low.
- The respiratory viruses circulating in Central America and
Caribbean are diverse, with different predominance of influenza
viruses (H1N1 pandemic, seasonal influenza A H3N3 and influenza B) in
each country.
- Two new confirmed deaths in 2 countries were reported; in total
there have been 8525 cumulative confirmed deaths in 28 countries of
the Region.

I. Evolution of the pandemic
----------------------------
South America
-------------
- Southern Cone:
Argentina and Brazil reported regional influenza activity. The trends
in acute respiratory disease were reported as unchanged in Brazil and
decreasing in Argentina. Both countries reported low to moderate
intensity of acute respiratory disease. Brazil reported low impact of
acute respiratory disease on health care services.

In Brazil, at the national level, the proportion of consultations for
influenza-like illness (ILI) increased in EW 25 [20-26 Jun 2010]
compared to 2 weeks earlier, and is approaching the upper limit of
the endemic channel. Regionally, in the south and central-west
regions, this proportion surpassed the epidemic threshold.

In Chile, in EW 27 [4-10 Jul 2010], at the national level, ILI
activity remained low. At the regional level, 4 regions reported no
ILI activity, 8 reported low activity, 2 reported moderate activity
(Los Lagos and Los Rios), and one reported high activity (Tarapaca).

In EW 26 [27 Jun-3 Jul 2010], Paraguay reported a 5.5 percent
decrease in the number of ILI outpatient consultations compared to
the previous EW; and overall, the number of ILI consultations is 52.5
percent less than what was seen during the same period in 2009.

- Andean:
Colombia and Peru reported regional influenza activity, while Ecuador
and Venezuela reported localized influenza activity. Colombia and
Peru reported increasing trends in acute respiratory disease, Ecuador
reported an unchanged trend, and Venezuela reported a decreasing
trend in acute respiratory disease. All these countries reported
low/moderate intensity of acute respiratory disease, and low impact
of acute respiratory disease on health care services.

Central America
---------------
Influenza activity was reported as widespread in Costa Rica and
Panama, regional in Nicaragua, and no activity in El Salvador and
Honduras. El Salvador reported an increasing trend in acute
respiratory disease, Costa Rica reported an unchanged trend, while
Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama reported decreasing trends. All these
countries reported low/moderate intensity of acute respiratory
disease and low impact of acute respiratory disease on health care
services, except Panama, which has reported high intensity and
moderate impact of acute respiratory disease on health care services
for 3 consecutive weeks.

Caribbean
---------
Influenza activity was reported as widespread in Jamaica, regional in
Cuba, localized in Dominica, with no activity in Dominican Republic.
Trends of acute respiratory disease were reported as increasing in
Dominica, unchanged in Dominican Republic, and decreasing in Cuba and
Jamaica. All countries reported low/moderate intensity of acute
respiratory disease, and low impact of acute respiratory disease on
health care services.

In countries providing these data*, the proportion of medical
admissions for severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) remained
stable during EW 24-26 [13 Jun-3 Jul 2010].

(* Participating CAREC [Caribbean Epidemiology Centre] member
countries, which include, Barbados, Dominica, Jamaica, St Vincent,
and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago, were assessed together).

North America
-------------
The United States reported regional influenza activity, a decreasing
trend in acute respiratory disease, low to moderate intensity of
acute respiratory disease and low impact on health care services. In
the United States, in EW 27 [4-10 Jul 2010], the proportion of
outpatient consultations for ILI continued to remain below the
national baseline. All the sub-national surveillance regions reported
the proportion of ILI to be below their region-specific baseline. The
proportion of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza was below
the epidemic threshold. No influenza-associated pediatric deaths were
reported this week.
