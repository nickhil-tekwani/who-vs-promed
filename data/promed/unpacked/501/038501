SVS (Secretariat of Health Surveillance) monitors cases of rash illness in the Northeast
----------------------------------------------------------------------
SVS communicates that since the end of February [2015] it has been monitoring reported cases of a rash illness in the Northeast. According to reports shared by the Health Departments of the states of Bahia, Maranhao, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraiba, and Sergipe, all cases have a benign course with spontaneous recovery, even without treatment. According to information passed to the Ministry of Health, 6807 cases of rash illness so far have been identified in the region. It is noteworthy that there have been no serious cases or deaths.

The most common signs and symptoms are rash (red spots) and pruritus (itching). To a lesser extent, cases with low-grade fever or no fever, with or without headache, pain or swelling in the joints, and muscle pain. The age group 20-40 years was the most affected. But there are reports of a patients 4 months old and another 98 years old.

According to the clinical features, the main assumptions in the investigations are: dengue, rubella, parvovirus B19, chikungunya, and measles, and other arboviruses and enteroviruses. So far, among 425 samples collected and tested, approximately 13 percent were positive for dengue. However, the clinical features available for now are not only characteristic of dengue cases. However, some samples tested for measles, rubella, chikungunya, and parvovirus were negative.

In order to identify the causative agent of this rash illness and to propose appropriate prevention and control measures, the SVS is conducting field investigations in collaboration with the Health Departments of Maranhao, Rio Grande do Norte, and Paraiba. In these investigations, they are including clinical aspects of patients and collecting samples, principally blood, which will be forwarded to the state and national reference laboratories.

Simultaneously, all health surveillances states and Northeast municipalities continue investigating and monitoring cases. The SVS and the Health Departments of the states of Alagoas, Bahia, Ceara, Maranhao, Paraiba, Piaui, Rio Grande do Norte, and Sergipe are conducting systematic monitoring through the Strategic Information Centres of Health Surveillance (CIEVS).

Allergy outbreak reaches residents of Pinheiral, RJ [Rio de Janeiro], says Health Surveillance
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Pinheiral residents in southern Rio de Janeiro state are facing an allergy outbreak. For the past 30 days, hundreds were treated at municipal First Aid post with similar symptoms. "An average 250 to 300 visits a day, most with joint pain, pain behind the eyes, fever, and itching, a rash on the body," explained Dr Erica Quintal Teixeira Fernandes [at present, dengue would be the most likely case. - Mod.RNA]

It happened with a merchant who 3 weeks ago began to feel discomfort [what type of discomfort? - Mod.RNA], followed by itching in the legs. Small bubbles and then spots began to appear [on his body], and the malaise worsened. After consulting the medical unit, he was treated for allergy and the itching decreased, but the marks on the body continued. Days later, his sons also went through the same problem. "We had headache, dizziness, shortness of breath, and vomiting," they said.

According to Health Surveillance, the prime suspect is that this is a new mutation of the dengue virus [based on what evidence? - Mod.RNA]. "With the investigations which the surveillance performs in relation to the symptoms, we can guarantee that 70 percent of these cases are dengue [confirmed by laboratory testing? And the other 30 percent? - Mod.RNA]," said Adriane Garcia da Rosa.

[These are, at the very least, worrying statements/speculations like "a new mutation of the dengue virus," used to attribute to dengue events/cases that perhaps are not even being investigated and (laboratory confirmed or discounted) systematically.

Investigations conducted by the Departments of Health of the states and the Ministry of Health are essential for elucidating and understanding the outbreaks that have been described.

Use of standardized case definitions and research lab protocols (sample collection and laboratory analysis) is mandatory, especially now that Zika virus has been announced as having been confirmed by a research laboratory (see below).

Question: Would the Zika virus be the "only" agent to be implicated in the cases/outbreaks that have been reported in the Northeast? Would it be circulating in (and infecting) other states? Let's keep our eyes open. - Mod.RNA

Since 8 Feb 2015 ProMED-PORT has posted reports in Portuguese of hundreds of cases of fever with rash and joint pains in several northeastern states of Brazil: Bahia, Maranhao, Paraiba, Pernambuco and Piaui (see map at

Now a Brazilian research group has reported identifying the cause as the mosquito-borne Zika virus:

http://g1.globo.com/bahia/noticia/2015/04/identificado-virus-causador-de-doenca-misteriosa-em-salvador-e-rms.html.

Other mosquito-borne viruses with similar symptoms such as dengue and chikungunya were excluded previously. They identified the virus by the PCR test, which detects signature portions of viral RNA. But Zika virus belongs to the group known as flaviviruses, which are notorious among virologists for their cross-reactions in lab tests. Until the actual virus is isolated, we cannot be certain it is not a totally new agent of the flavivirus group.

Zika seems unlikely, because it up to now it has only been detected in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. One suggestion is that it was imported by a football fan incubating it who was visiting Brazil for the World Cup. But the cup final was in mid-July 2014 -- where could the virus have been hiding since then? Until its identity is confirmed, this is all speculation. - Mod.JW
