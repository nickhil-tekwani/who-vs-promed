The largest outbreak of measles in the country in Stolipinovo is already subsiding. No new cases have been reported in the neighborhood in Plovdiv in the last week [week of 16-22 Jul 2017], Todor Kantardzhiev, the director of the National Center for Contagious and Parasitic Diseases, announced on [Mon 24 Jul 2017] before the Bulgarian National Television.

According to him, more than 160 people from Plovdiv, Pazardzhik and Montana were infected with measles. The 1st cases of measles infection were recorded in March this year [2017] amid an outbreak in Romania. The 1st ones were infected from the Stolipinovo district of Plovdiv, including a 10-month-old baby who died. The disease spread rapidly, and in just a few weeks the infected were dozens. According to Prof. Kantardzhiev, at the height of summer in our sea resorts the registered cases of viral infections are less than those in Sofia.

"The bad thing is that the enteroviruses of 200-330 patients, can cause inflammation of the nervous system, which is why we say -- very good hygiene in the summer is vital -- hands washing, before meals, after using the toilet, antibacterial wipes are just some of the main advises.

The number of measles deaths in Romania has reached 32 since the onset of the outbreak last year [2016]. A 29-year old person from Dolj county died last week [week of 16-22 Jul 2017], according to the National Center for Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases (CNSCBT).

The person's disease was confirmed in February this year [2017], but the 1st symptoms of the post-measles complication occurred in June.

The measles outbreak began last fall. Some 8246 measles cases were registered until [Fri 21 Jul 2017], and 32 people died during this period, according to CNSCBT.

Last week [week of 16-22 Jul 2017], the Health Ministry and the Interior Ministry started a vaccination campaign against measles.

There are about 180 000 unvaccinated kids in Romania, according to the Health Ministry. Only 10 percent refuse vaccination, whereas the rest of them don't even reach a doctor. The Health Ministry currently has over 500 000 measles vaccine doses, which should be enough until the end of the year.
