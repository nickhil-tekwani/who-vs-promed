A total of 10 airport workers -- out of almost 19 000 swabbed -- have tested positive for COVID-19 in a special testing operation after the emergence of a cluster of cases at Changi Airport.

The tests were carried out from 9-20 May [2021], and all the infected workers are from Terminal 3, with workers from Terminal 1 and Jewel Changi Airport testing negative.

Apart from the 10 airport workers, 33 other workers had tested positive through other channels, such as when they reported sick or when they were serving quarantine orders.

In all, 43 airport workers have tested positive for COVID-19 so far, said the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and Changi Airport Group (CAG) on Friday (21 May [2021]).

The 2 agencies gave the figures in an update on measures taken at Changi Airport to deal with the growing number of cases linked to the airport's COVID-19 cluster, which is currently the largest active one here with 104 cases as at Friday [21 May 2021].

They said test results for an initial batch of COVID-19-positive airport workers were found to be similar and indicated the B1617 virus variant that was first detected in India. This suggests that their infections came from a common source.

"Preliminary investigations indicate that the initial transmission could have occurred through an airport worker who was assisting a family from South Asia, who arrived in Singapore on 29 Apr 2021 and were subsequently found to be positive for COVID-19 through their on-arrival tests," said the 2 agencies.

CAAS and CAG did not say which country the family was from.

The agencies said that since Thursday [20 May 2021], workers in Terminal 3 Basement 2 who tested negative for COVID-19 in their 1st test have been rostered to take an additional test.

From Sunday (23 May [2021]), airport workers in higher-risk roles will be required to take an additional antigen rapid test (ART) between their 7-day rostered routine tests.

Passengers from very-high-risk places must also now undergo an ART on arrival, on top of the usual polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.

"The quicker turnaround time of an ART compared to a PCR test will allow for public health action to be taken more quickly for persons who test positive by ART," said CAAS and CAG.

The 2 agencies said they will work with the aviation community to vaccinate more workers in the next few weeks. More than 90% of front-line aviation workers have been vaccinated so far.

CAAS and CAG reiterated that precautions are in place at the airport to guard against COVID-19. For example, workers handling flights from the highest-risk countries wear full personal protective equipment. Most of the cases among airport workers were detected early: cases peaked around 13 May [2021], with very few cases among airport workers subsequently. None of the airport workers who tested positive is in serious condition, requires oxygen, or is in the intensive care unit.

Since this month [May 2021], the airport has further segregated passengers arriving from low-risk places from other passengers.

Passenger terminals at Changi Airport and Jewel will remain closed to the public until the end of the phase 2 (heightened alert) period on 13 Jun [2021] as an added precaution.

During the closure, airport workers will be briefed about the new measures and requirements, CAAS and CAG said. But the airport remains open for air travel, they added.

[2] New canine coronavirus in humans
Date: Thu 20 May 2021
Source: Science [abridged, edited]
https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/05/two-more-coronaviruses-can-infect-people-studies-suggest?utm_campaign=news_daily_2021-05-20&et_rid=54806180&et_cid=3781045


Eight children hospitalized with pneumonia in Malaysia several years ago had evidence of infections with a novel coronavirus similar to one found in dogs, a research team reports today [20 May 2021]. Only 7 coronaviruses were previously known to infect people, the latest being SARS-CoV-2, the spark of the COVID-19 pandemic. The discovery of this likely new human pathogen, along with the report of an instance of a coronavirus that appears to have jumped from pigs to people many years ago, could significantly expand which members of the viral family pose another global threat.

"I think the more we look, the more we will find that these coronaviruses are crossing species everywhere," says Stanley Perlman, a virologist at the University of Iowa who was not involved in the new work.

The researchers have not definitely linked either new virus to human disease. And there's no evidence that the 2 new coronaviruses can transmit between people: each infection may have been a dead-end jump into a person from a nonhuman host. But many researchers worry the viruses may evolve that ability within a person or the animals they normally infect. A complete genome sequence of the virus found in one Malaysian patient, reported today [20 May 2021] in Clinical Infectious Diseases, reveals a chimera of genes from 4 coronaviruses: 2 previously identified canine coronaviruses, one known to infect cats, and what looks like a pig virus.

This is the 1st report suggesting that a canine-like coronavirus can replicate in people, and further studies will need to confirm the ability. The researchers have grown the virus in dog tumor cells but not yet in human cells.

Unlike with SARS-CoV-2 and other known human coronaviruses, "we don't have any clear evidence that this particular [coronavirus] strain is better adapted to humans because of its spike structure," says veterinary virologist Anastasia Vlasova of Ohio State University (OSU), Wooster, lead author of the study. Human infections from dog coronaviruses may occur "at a much higher frequency than we previously thought," she adds. This particular virus might not transmit between people, but we don't know that for sure, Vlasova cautions.

The 8 children whose tissue samples Vlasova and her colleagues studied were mainly living in traditional longhouses or villages in rural or suburban Sarawak on Borneo, where they likely had frequent exposure to domestic animals and jungle wildlife. They were among 301 hospitalized pneumonia patients during 2017-2018, and the researchers screened their nasopharyngeal samples -- tissue from the upper part of the throat -- for a large variety of human and nonhuman coronaviruses.

Standard hospital diagnostics for pneumonia or other respiratory illness would not have detected dog and cat coronaviruses. No one has been looking for these viruses in patients with such illnesses until recently. "These canine and feline coronaviruses are everywhere in the world," Perlman says.

The entire novel virus sequence from the children's samples most resembles a canine coronavirus. However, the sequence for its spike protein, which attaches to host cell receptors to initiate an infection, is closely related to the spike sequence of canine coronavirus type I and the one for a porcine coronavirus known as transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). And one part of the spike protein bears a 97% similarity to the spike of a feline coronavirus.

This chimera is unlikely to have arisen at once, but instead involved repeat genetic reshuffles between different coronaviruses over time. "This is a mosaic of several different recombinations, happening over and over, when nobody's watching. And then boom, you get this monstrosity," says virologist Benjamin Neuman at Texas A&M University, College Station.

The animal that actually transmitted the novel virus to the people could have been a cat, pig, dog, "or some wild carnivores," says Vito Martella, a veterinary virologist at the University of Bari in Italy. He plans to screen stored fecal samples from Italian children with acute gastroenteritis to see whether he can find something similar.

Researchers already knew 3 canine coronavirus subtypes mix readily with feline and porcine coronaviruses. "What is more surprising is that these [animal] viruses can actually cause disease in a person," Perlman says, because one would expect them to lack some of the genes important for adapting well to people.

Seven of the 8 children whose tissues harbored sequences of the virus were younger than 5 years old, and 4 of them were infants, mostly from Indigenous ethnic groups. Each was hospitalized for 4-7 days and recovered.

Scientists divide coronaviruses into 4 genera -- alpha, beta, gamma, and delta -- and the new one is an alpha. It is the 3rd such alpha coronavirus to infect people; the other 2 cause common colds, and most people are exposed to them early in life. That pattern may explain why only children were perhaps sickened by this new one. Ralph Baric, a virologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, suggests adults may have some immunity to the newly discovered alpha coronavirus because of repeated exposure to the other 2.

So far, the most dangerous human coronaviruses -- SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV -- are the betas. Researchers haven't seen alphas trigger an outbreak of serious disease in humans, Neuman says, "but that doesn't feel like much comfort in the wild world of viruses."

In March [2021], researchers at the University of Florida reported in a medRxiv preprint the 1st evidence of a porcine delta coronavirus that infects people, in serum from 3 Haitian children who had fevers in 2014-2015. The researchers transferred serum samples into monkey cells and were able to grow viruses that they matched, genetically, to known porcine coronaviruses. (The work has been submitted to a peer-reviewed journal; [ref.: Lednicky JA, Tagliamonte MS, White SK, et al.: Emergence of porcine delta-coronavirus pathogenic infections among children in Haiti through independent zoonoses and convergent evolution. medRxiv. 2021; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.19.21253391]).

Delta coronaviruses were once thought to infect only birds. Then, in 2012, a delta coronavirus infected swine in Hong Kong. It "appears to have jumped over from songbirds," says OSU coronavirologist Linda Saif, who went on to isolate the virus in swine cell cultures.

The same virus caused a major fatal diarrheal disease outbreak in baby pigs in the United States in 2014. It has since been shown to infect cell lines from humans, pigs, and chickens; lab studies have shown the virus causes persistent infection and diarrheal disease when put into poultry. "It's out on its own, a left-field-type virus that infects both avian and mammalian species," Baric says. "There aren't any other coronaviruses that I know can do this."

Some virologists have labeled the Hong Kong delta coronavirus a pandemic threat. The Haitian virus differs considerably, and virologists want to test local children and adults for antibodies to it. If its ability to infect people is confirmed, it may also be viewed as a pandemic threat, Saif says.

Together, the 2 reports point to the importance of animal diseases in public health, and the need for coronavirus vaccines for domesticated animals. "This research clearly shows that more studies are desperately needed to evaluate critical questions regarding the frequency of cross-species [coronavirus] transmission and potential for human-to-human spread," Baric says.

Gregory Gray at Duke University, senior author on the Malaysian chimeric coronavirus study, also advocates for surveillance among pneumonia patients in areas known to be hot spots for novel viruses or places where large populations of animals and humans mix, such as live animal markets and large farms. "These spillovers take years," Gray says. "It's not like in the movies. They go through different steps to infect humans." So far, indications are that the chimeric virus has not evolved to transmit efficiently between people.

["In the past 20 years, new coronaviruses have emerged from animals with remarkable regularity. In 2002, SARS-CoV jumped from civets into people. Ten years later, MERS emerged from camels. Then in 2019, SARS-CoV-2 began to spread around the world.

"For many scientists, this pattern points to a disturbing trend: coronavirus outbreaks aren't rare events and will likely occur every decade or so."

The patients' samples [were sent] to a world expert on animal coronaviruses at Ohio State University, virologist Anastasia Vlasova.

"'Canine coronaviruses were not thought to be transmitted to people. It's never been reported before,' Vlasova said."

"She found a disturbing clue about the virus's future. 'We did discover a very, very unique mutation -- or deletion -- in the genome,' Vlasova says. That specific deletion, she says, isn't present in any other known dog coronaviruses, but it is found somewhere else: in human coronaviruses. 'It's a mutation that's very similar to one previously found in the SARS coronavirus and in [versions of] SARS-CoV-2 ... [that appeared] very soon after its introduction into the human population,' Vlastova says.

"This deletion, she believes, helps the dog virus infect or persist inside humans. And it may be a key step required for coronaviruses to make the jump into people.

"'Apparently the deletion is somehow associated with [the virus'] adaptation during this jump from animal to human,' she says."

"It's not known how these patients became infected with the virus or whether they had direct contact with infected animals."

(Quoted material above from https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2021/05/20/996515792/a-newly-identified-coronavirus-is-making-people-sick-and-it-s-coming-from-dogs)

Infection of dogs with SARS-CoV-2 is rare, and the dogs do not appear to spread the virus.

"Two pet dogs in Hong Kong tested positive for COVID-19, and both dogs lived in homes with COVID-19-positive owners. Local health officials characterize the cases of the 2 dogs in Hong Kong as "likely to be a case of human-to-animal transmission," and neither dog showed any signs of illness from the virus" (see https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/can-dogs-get-coronavirus/)."

These findings of coronaviruses in dogs, cats, pigs, and other animals demonstrate the importance of One Health intensive surveillance as well as illustrate the importance of developing a broad diagnostic assay that will detect more genetically distinct coronaviruses. A veterinary coronavirus vaccine should be considered as a good approach to protecting human and animal health. - Mod.LK]

[3] Virus detection: saliva vs nasal swabs
Date: Wed 7 Apr 2021

Savela ES, Winnett A, Romano AE, et al.: SARS-CoV-2 is detectable using sensitive RNA saliva testing days before viral load reaches detection range of low-sensitivity nasal swab tests. MedRxiv. 2021; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.02.21254771

Abstract
Early detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical to reduce asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic spread of COVID-19, curb the spread of viral variants by travelers, and maximize efficacy of therapeutic treatments. We designed a study to evaluate the preferred test sensitivity and sample type (saliva and nasal swab) for detecting early infections of COVID-19. We performed a case-ascertained study to monitor household contacts of individuals recently diagnosed with a SARS-CoV-2 infection. From those individuals, we obtained twice-daily self-collected anterior-nares nasal swabs and saliva samples and quantified SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral loads in those samples using high-sensitivity RT-qPCR and RT-ddPCR assays. We found that SARS-CoV-2 RNA first appears in saliva and then in nasal-swab samples. A high-sensitivity (limit of detection of approximately 10^3 copies/mL) RNA test detected SARS-CoV-2 virus in saliva 1.5-4.5 days before the viral load in the paired nasal-swab samples exceeded the limit of detection of low-sensitivity tests. It was possible to observe a high (greater than 10^7-10^8 copies/mL) viral load in saliva samples while the paired nasal swab was either negative or had low (approximately 103 copies/mL) viral load. Our results indicate that both sampling site and test sensitivity must be considered to ensure early detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection: high-sensitivity tests that use saliva can detect SARS-CoV-2 infection days earlier than low-sensitivity tests that use nasal swabs. Furthermore, early in the infection, low-sensitivity tests that use nasal swabs may miss SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals with very high and potentially infectious viral loads in saliva.

Conclusions
First, choosing correct sampling site is critical for early detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Second, early in an infection, it is inappropriate to assume that a person is "not infectious" or "has low viral load" based on a measurement from a single sample type such as a nasal swab. Saliva is known to carry infectious virus. In our study, it was possible to observe a very high (greater than 10^7 -10^8 copies/mL) viral load in saliva samples while the paired nasal swab was either negative (Fig. 2D, ROI#2) or had low (approximately 103 copies/mL) viral load (Fig. 2D, subsequent day after ROI#2).

Third, using a diagnostic test with high analytical sensitivity, rather than a test of a particular type, is essential to early detection.

Fourth, in our data, when a high-sensitivity test is combined with saliva as a sample type, SARS-CoV-2 infection can be detected up to 4.5 days earlier relative to a low-sensitivity test from a nasal swab. However, during the peak of the infection, in individuals with mild COVID-19 viral load in nasal swab was higher than in saliva, supporting the preferred use of nasal swabs in environments where only low-sensitivity testing is available.
