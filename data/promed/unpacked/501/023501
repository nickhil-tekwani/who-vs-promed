Six persons have so far died from rabies in the Upper West Region this year [2015].

The Deputy Director of Public Health in the region, Dr Winfred Ofosu, who disclosed this fact, bemoaned the high prevalence of rabies in the region due to the failure of owners to vaccinate their dogs. At a meeting with the regional epidemic management committee last Friday, Dr Ofosu said there were enough vaccines to take care of the large population of dogs in the region.

The meeting, which attracted all stakeholders, was to discuss their preparedness to detect and contain any health hazard that posed a threat to the people in the region.

[To find the Upper West Province, go to: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/ghana_admin_2007.jpg. It is a relatively small province in the northwest corner of Ghana.

On face value, this is a report of recent (this year, 2015) fatal human cases of rabies in the northwest, but the close way that human public health and veterinary services function in Ghana, it is not impossible that the speaker was referring to recent diagnoses of canine rabies, and the latter cases overflow, as we know, into the former. Either way, it is a worrying situation. - Mod.MHJ
