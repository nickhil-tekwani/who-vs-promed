2000/046J - Tomato yellow vein streak begomovirus
--------------------------------------------------
Why: Tomato yellow vein streak begomovirus came to our attention as causing
an emerging disease of tomato in the Americas. It was described as a new
begomovirus affecting tomato by Faria et al. (1997).
Where: Brazil (near Campinas, State of São Paulo).
On which plants: Tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_). Experimentally,
_Bemisia tabaci_ was able to transmit the virus from infected tomato plants
to healthy tomato and potato plants, reproducing the original symptoms in
tomato. On potato, the apical leaves showed yellow or green mottle which
developed into leaf distortion with yellow blotches (apparently no natural
infection have been found on potato).
Damage: Yellow streaking of veins on the apical shoots. Leaf symptoms
developed into patches of yellow mosaic and the leaves became wavy. In the
observed fields near Campinas, approximately 20% of young tomato plants
showed symptoms.
Transmission: Transmitted by _Bemisia tabaci_.
Pathway: Infected tomato plants, fruits?, viruliferous _B. tabaci_ from
countries where tomato yellow mosaic begomovirus occurs.
Possible risks: Tomato is an important crop in the EPPO region, both indoor
and outdoor and the virus vector is present in many parts of the EPPO
region. The disease appears so far, limited in Brazil but data is lacking
its extent and severity. It is not known whether potato can be naturally
infected.
