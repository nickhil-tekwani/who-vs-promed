-------------------------------------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 3 Feb 2021 from Dr Thomas Sit, chief veterinary officer/assistant director (inspection & quarantine), Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, Hong Kong, (SAR-PRC)

Summary
Report type: immediate notification (final report)
Date of start of the event: 28 Jan 2021
Date of confirmation of the event: 31 Jan 2021
Date event resolved: 28 Jan 2021
Reason for notification: recurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 6 Jan 2021
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza A [AI] virus
Serotype: H5N8
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Lake Silver, Wu Kai Sha, Sha Tin, Hong Kong
Date of start of the outbreak: 28 Jan 2021
Outbreak status: resolved on 28 Jan 2021
Epidemiological unit: not applicable
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Peregrine falcon: _Falco peregrinus_ (Falconidae) / - / 1 / 1/ 0 / 0
Affected population: A dead peregrine falcon was collected on 28 Jan 2021 in Lake Silver, Wu Kai Sha. The species is a common resident and winter visitor.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Peregrine falcon: _F. peregrinus_ (Falconidae) / ** / ** / 100 / **
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter
**Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: An avian influenza intensive surveillance system is in place for all poultry farms, poultry markets, and pet bird shops in Hong Kong. The H5N8-infected animal was detected in the ongoing national surveillance program on wild birds. Neither the Hong Kong Wetland Park nor Mai Po Nature Reserve nor any poultry farms are located within 3 km [1.9 mi] of the outbreak location. No spread of disease was evident. The date of end of the outbreak is the same as the date the bird was found (28 Jan 2021).

Control measures
Measures applied: screening, disinfection, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Tai Lung Veterinary Laboratory, Agriculture, Fisheries & Conservation Department (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Peregrine falcon: _Falco peregrinus_ (Falconidae) / immunohistochemical test / 29 Jan 2021 / positive
Peregrine falcon: _F. peregrinus_ (Falconidae) / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 29 Jan 2021 / positive
Peregrine falcon: _F. peregrinus_ (Falconidae) / virus isolation / 31 Jan 2021 / positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[Eastern Asia has been a hot spot for HPAIV outbreaks for more than 20 years, and most of the new lineage strains and genetic reassortments were produced within or near this region. Outbreaks of HPAI H5N8 re-emerged in eastern Asia in the last part of 2020. The high sequence homology with isolates in Europe during the winter season 2019-2020 suggests that the variants currently causing outbreaks in Asia came from Europe, perhaps via bird migration. - Mod.PMB]
