A Michigan farmer has died after contracting the mosquito-borne virus eastern equine encephalitis (EEE). The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services confirmed the farmer died following complications with the virus on [Sat 16 Nov 2019], local outlet WOOD-TV reported.

The farmer has since been identified as an Eau Claire [Berrien County] resident, according to 16 News Now. He died at Memorial Hospital.

EEE, also known as sleeping sickness, is a rare virus that causes inflammation of the brain. It is spread by the bite of a mosquito infected with the disease [virus], according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

According to a GoFundMe page set up by a family friend, the man became extremely ill on [19 Aug 2019]. At first, it appeared as though he was suffering from a fever, but his condition began to worsen quite rapidly, according to [the friend]. Shortly after, [the man] was admitted to the hospital in critical condition. He remained in ICU for 4 weeks before being transferred to a long-term care facility, the GoFundMe page reads.

The family stayed hopeful the man would recover as he showed signs of progress, but unfortunately, he later died.

According to 16 News Now, the farmer contracted the virus along with a fellow farmer, whose condition is unclear at this time.

According to WOOD-TV there have been 10 cases of EEE in Michigan this summer [2019]. The man is the 6th person to die.

The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.

The CDC says that people over 50 and under 15 years old are more susceptible to the illness, which starts to show symptoms 4-10 days after infection. Those infected will develop chills, fever, lethargy, and joint pain. In cases where the disease enters the central nervous system, 1/3 of patients die from EEE. In most cases, death occurs within the 1st 4-10 days of a person developing the symptoms but can occur much later as it did with this man. Those who survive are likely to be mentally and physically disabled.

There is no vaccine for the disease.

[This has been an unusually active year for EEE in the USA. Michigan has been particularly hard hit, with 10 cases and now the 6th death. There have been neurological cases of EEE virus infection in deer and horses in the state as well. Horses can be vaccinated but there is no vaccine for humans. The EEE virus transmission season is now over in the Upper Midwest USA, including Michigan. Killing frosts have ended the activity of the vector mosquitoes for the remainder of the year (2019) and the following winter season. - Mod.TY
