EPR - Outbreak News: Ebola virus disease, West Africa -- situation as of 10 Apr 2014
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Guinea
------
As of [10 Apr 2014], a cumulative total of 157 clinically compatible cases, including 101 deaths have been officially reported.

Laboratory investigations continue at the Institut Pasteur (IP) Dakar laboratory in Conakry [Guinea] (65 samples tested, of which 38 are positive by PCR for ebolavirus) and at the European Union Mobile Laboratory (EMLab) team in Gueckedou [Guinea] (38 samples tested/28 positive). A total of 66 clinical cases have been laboratory confirmed (42 per cent), while 87 of the remaining clinical cases are classified as probable cases and 4 as suspected cases.

24 of the 101 deaths have been laboratory confirmed. 6 districts of Guinea have reported patients -- Conakry (20 patients, all laboratory confirmed), Gueckedou (96 cases/32 confirmed), Macenta (28 cases/12 confirmed), Kissidougou (9 cases/1 confirmed), and Dabola and Djingaraye combined (5 cases/1 confirmed). The date of onset of the most recently identified suspected clinical cases in Conakry and Gueckedou was [8 Apr 2014].

One additional healthcare worker (HCW) [case] has been reported since the [7 Apr 2014] update, bringing the total to 15 (10 laboratory confirmed and 5 probable cases). Medical observation is continuing for 488 contacts while 453 have been discharged from follow-up. No new contacts were identified on [8 Apr 2014].

Liberia
-------
As of [10 Apr 2014], the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) of Liberia has reported a cumulative total of 5 laboratory confirmed cases and 20 suspected and probable cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD).

The date of onset of the most recent confirmed case is [6 Apr 2014], with 6 patients currently hospitalised. Lofa County accounts for 32 per cent of the clinical cases reported to date (4 laboratory confirmed/6 suspected cases) followed by Margibi County (27 per cent, 1 confirmed/ 5 suspected cases). Other Counties at risk include Bong (4 suspected cases) and Nimba (3 suspected cases). Montserrado and Grand Cape Mount Counties have each reported one suspected case.

At present 32 contacts remain under medical observation.

The cumulative number of 12 deaths are being attributed to EVD; Lofa (9), Nimba (1), Margibi (1), and Montserrado (1). All 5 laboratory confirmed cases have died. Laboratory confirmed deaths have occurred in Lofa County (4) and Margibi County (1).

Mali
----
As of [10 Apr 2014], the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Mali has reported a cumulative total of 9 suspected cases, one of whom has died. The most recent suspected case was an unexplained death in a female who had travelled between Siguiri Prefecture, in the Kankan Region of Guinea, and Bamako. Clinical samples were collected from all of the suspected cases to date. 2 of these patients have previously been reported as testing negative for ebolavirus infection and other viral haemorrhagic fever viruses in assays conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. The remaining 7 samples have been dispatched to the Institut Pasteur, Dakar, for testing.

The patients who previously tested negative have been released from medical follow-up and counselling has been provided to their families. The isolation facility as the Centre National d'Appui a la lute contre les Maladie (CNAM), Bamako, designed for the management of cases of Lassa fever, is receiving the suspected cases of EVD. Suspected cases have also been reported from Kouremale (2) and Bankoumana (1) in Koulikoro Region of Mali.

Sierra Leone
------------
Although the epidemiological situation in Sierra Leone remains unchanged, the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS) continues to lead intensive EVD preparedness activities. 7 teams, each composed of a director from the MOHS, a program officer of the Disease Prevention and Control directorate, and a program officer from the national Health Education program have been dispatched to each of districts bordering Liberia and Guinea (Kambia, Kenema, Koinadugu, Kailahun, Bombali, Pujehun, and Kono districts) to assess district preparedness with local authorities, including community-wide approaches to EVD preparedness and response and to pre-position supplies.

WHO, in collaboration with technical partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) has deployed field laboratory support, and continues to identify and deploy experts in anthropology, epidemiology and data management, outbreak logistics, clinical case management and infection prevention and control, social mobilisation, risk communications, and outbreak coordination to support the response in all of the affected countries. Over 50 experts have been deployed to date and response supplies, including PPE and a variety of EVD communication and education materials for local adaptation, have been dispatched to affected and neighbouring countries.

As EVD in West Africa continues to evolve, the number of reported cases and deaths, contacts under medical observation, and the number of laboratory results are subject to change due to consolidation of case, contact, and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance and contact tracing activities and ongoing laboratory investigations.

WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, Mali, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.

[3] UNICEF press release
Date: Thu 10 Apr 2014

Life-saving information helps reduce spread of Ebola across West Africa - Guinea
----------------------------------------------------------------
Together with Ministries of Health and other partners across 7 countries in West Africa, UNICEF is using text messaging through mobile phones, radio shows, TV programmes, and door-to-door campaigns to disseminate life-saving information in an effort to contain the often-fatal Ebola virus disease.

"Most of the people in this part of the world had never heard of [_Ebolavirus_] before," said Dr Guido Borghese, UNICEF principal advisor Child Survival and Development for West and Central Africa. "In this environment, unfounded fears and rumours spread quickly and widely. More than ever, it is crucial that families have both the means and the right information to protect themselves and prevent dangerous misunderstandings."

In collaboration with partners such as the Red Cross and the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF is stepping up efforts to design culturally-sensitive communication strategies and raise awareness of Ebola, at the grassroots level, across the 7 at-risk or affected countries in West Africa.

In Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Cote d'Ivoire, Senegal, Mali, and Guinea-Bissau, mass and digital media and inter-personal communication activities are being carried out to prevent people contracting the ebolavirus amongst communities and health workers in mosques, churches, schools, health centres, and markets.

UNICEF is urgently appealing for USD 1.2 million for Guinea and almost USD 1.3 million for neighbouring countries including Liberia, Sierra Leone, Senegal, Guinea Bissau, and Mali, to provide disinfectant products, essential medicines, life-saving supplies, and communication support crucially needed to stop ebolavirus from spreading further across West Africa.

[The UNICEF/ReliefWeb efforts described above are unfortunately likely to result in a rush to health centres by anyone who has a fever or been in contact with a fever case, thus overloading them -- just as they would in the USA, Europe and Asia if a case were to be suspected there. After the 1995 Aum Shinrikyo sarin attack on the Tokyo subway, thousands of people who had never been anywhere near the subway flooded hospital emergency rooms with real or imagined symptoms. - Mod.JW]

Notable points from the WHO virtual press conference on Ebola held on 8 Apr 2014:

- It reaffirms the Ebola negative result from Ghana reported earlier, something [which was] strangely questioned by some on this list. [Nigerian biomedical and life scientists Yahoo Groups]

- Dr Fukuda stresses that the outbreak, like other Ebola outbreaks, can be controlled by enhancing clinical detection and management protocols in tandem with rapid surveillance to track case contacts and prevent further transmission.

This will be the challenge in Nigeria if it ever occurs. Have our doctors and other healthcare workers been able to manage Lassa fever such that we have prevented healthcare-acquired Lassa fever as much as possible? According to the briefing, about 14 health workers have died in Conakry.

- Dr Fukuda reiterates that spreading misinformation, rumours, and other panic-engendering behaviours are an unwanted challenge to controlling the outbreak. Food for thought.

- His broad minded answer to the question on travel restriction should be of immense value.

[What is new in Guinea is one more (avoidable) HCW case and only 488 contacts still under observation (down from 600), while 453 have been discharged from follow-up. The length of the follow-up period is not stated, but the incubation period is up to 21 days, and to be on the safe side, twice the incubation period is normally recommended, and the 1st laboratory confirmed cases were reported on 27 Mar 2014.

The comments from a Nigerian point of view are valuable. One wonders what the reaction of Ghana and other West African countries "in the firing line" are like. - Mod.JW
