Cormorant Mortality at California's Salton Sea.
According to the latest reports from the Salton Sea NWR staff approximately
2,000 cormorant nestlings have died on Mullet Island and only about 400
active nests remain. A similar occurrence in 1997 was attributed to
Newcastle disease, a potentially serious disease of domestic poultry.
So far, neither the USGS National Wildlife Health Center at Madison, WI,
nor the State of California Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at San
Bernardino, CA, have confirmed Newcastle disease virus as the cause of the
1998 cormorant mortality at Salton Sea. The histopathology is consistent
with previous Newcastle events and additional samples have been requested
by both Laboratories for virus isolation. The virus isolated from the 1997
Newcastle event was also difficult to isolate and Newcastle is still
suspected.
