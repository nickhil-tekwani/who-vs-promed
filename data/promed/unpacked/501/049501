[This thorough report is very much appreciated. Israel reported this disease to the OIE WAHID database as single outbreaks in 2008 and 2011. In 2005, there were 28 outbreaks reported in Israel from June to December, while in 2006, there were a total of 20 outbreaks reported. Let's hope the more recent trend of a single, solitary outbreak is the result in the case at hand now and we would appreciate any updates or information. - Mod.PC]
