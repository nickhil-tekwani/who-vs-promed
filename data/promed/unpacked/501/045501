Researchers study spread of parrot disease
------------------------------------------
Researchers at Auckland Zoo are trying to understand a virus that is affecting native parrots and spreading through the country. Beak and feather disease was found in kakariki parrots in 2008 and this year [2012] has turned up in the South Island for the 1st time.

The virus seemed to be confined to introduced parrots until it appeared 4 years ago in the Hauraki Gulf.

In January [2012], it appeared in Fiordland in a 2nd species of kakariki, which is also known as the New Zealand parakeet. Tests are being done on Tiritiri Matangi Island in the Hauraki Gulf to measure the spread and damage of the virus. Researchers say there is a risk it could spread to other native parrots, such as kea, kaka and the critically endangered kakapo. So far no kakapo has contracted the virus.

Auckland Zoo vet Bethany Jackson says its effects vary from species to species and by age. She says it can cause some birds to lose feathers or die very quickly, while others recover completely.

[Psittacine beak and feather disease is a viral disease affecting all Old World and New World parrots. The virus belongs to the family Circoviridae. The virus attacks the feather follicles and the beak and claws-growing cells of the bird, causing progressive feather malformation and necrosis. In later stages of the disease, the feathers develop constrictions in feather shafts, cease development early until eventually all feather growth stops. The disease was first diagnosed in Australia early in the 20th century. It was introduced to New Zealand in captive parrots but has only recently been found in wild parrots. The potential impacts of psittacine beak and feather disease on New Zealand's wild native parrots -- kaka, kea, kakariki and kakapo -- are currently unknown.
