Outbreak of _Salmonella_ Enteritidis Infections Linked to Peaches: Final Update
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, FDA, and the Public Health Agency of Canada investigated a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella_ Enteritidis infections.

Public health investigators used the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that were part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on _Salmonella_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using a standardized laboratory and data analysis method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these sequences that are used to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives investigators detailed information about the bacteria causing illness. In this investigation, WGS showed that bacteria isolated from ill people were closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak were likely to share a common source of infection.

A total of 101 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis were reported from 17 states.

Total / 101


Illnesses started on dates ranging from [29 Jun 2020], to [27 Aug 2020]. Ill people ranged in age from 1 to 92 years, with a median age of 43. A total of 64% of ill people were female. Of 90 ill people with available information, 28 hospitalizations were reported. No deaths were reported.

Whole genome sequencing analysis of 83 bacterial isolates from ill people did not predict any antimicrobial resistance. Standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory is underway. Whole genome sequencing analysis showed that an outbreak of _Salmonella_ Enteritidis infections in Canada was related genetically to this outbreak in the USA. This means that people in both outbreaks were likely to share a common source of infection.

Investigation of the Outbreak
-----------------------------
Epidemiologic and traceback evidence indicated that peaches packed or supplied by Prima Wawona or Wawona Packing Company were the likely source of this outbreak.

In interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. Of 62 people with information, 50 (81%) reported eating fresh peaches in the week before their illness started. This percentage was significantly higher than results from a survey of healthy people in which 20% reported eating peaches in the week before they were interviewed. Of the 40 people who reported information on how the peaches were packaged, 25 (63%) reported buying loose peaches and the remaining 15 reported buying pre-bagged peaches.

The FDA and regulatory officials in several states collected records from grocery stores where ill people reported buying peaches. These records showed that loose and bagged peaches distributed by Wawona Packing Company, LLC, were sold at multiple grocery stores where ill people bought peaches.

On [22 Aug 2020], Prima Wawona recalled bagged and bulk, or loose, peaches that they supplied to retailers nationwide. Recalled products are past their shelf life and should no longer be available in stores.

As of [16 Oct 2020], this outbreak appears to be over.

[Peaches grow on trees and as such are less susceptible to contamination while growing than a melon would be growing on the ground. A PubMed search did not reveal any reported outbreaks, but as seen in this publication, contamination may be found and may not necessarily be acquired in packing facilities.

Abstract
--------
Automated fruit sorting systems with individual fruit carriers are utilized in modern fruit packing facilities. This study evaluated the levels of naturally occurring microflora on the surfaces of peaches and fruit carriers during automated sorting operations at stone fruit packinghouses in California. The study also assessed the growth potential of _Salmonella enterica_ and _Listeria monocytogenes_ on fruit carriers under various environmental conditions. No difference of microbial loads was found on peaches (n = 420) before, during, and after fruit sorting at seven packinghouses. The average surface total microbial, coliform, and yeast and mold levels of peaches during sorting were 3.6, 2.7, and 1.9 log CFU/cm2, respectively. Environmental swab testing indicated routine cleaning of fruit carriers (n = 192) reduced total microbes from 3.9 to 3.2 log CFU/cm2 (P = 0.003) and coliforms from 1.5 to 0.9 log CFU/cm2 (P = 0.001) on carriers' fruit contact surfaces. Laboratory exposures to temperature (22, 28, 34, or 40 deg C) [71.6, 82.4, 93.2, 104 deg F] and humidity (65, 75, 85 or 95%) conditions significantly reduced inoculated _Salmonella_ and _Listeria_ on clean and commercially used (deposited with wax, fuzz, dirt, etc.) fruit carriers within 24 h (P less than 0.001). The observed _Salmonella_ reduction was greater on clean carriers (P less than 0.001). On used carriers, _Salmonella_ was persistent at 95% humidity and _Listeria_ was persistent at 22 deg C [71.6 deg F]. The results showed the levels of surface microflora on peaches during fruit sorting, the reduction of microbial loads on fruit carriers due to packinghouses' cleaning, and the reduction, rather than growth, of _Salmonella_ and _Listeria_ under tested conditions on fruit carriers. - Mod.LL
