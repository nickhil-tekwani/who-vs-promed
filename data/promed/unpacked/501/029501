British Columbia responds to flu-like illness in nursing home
-------------------------------------------------------------
VANCOUVER August 14, 2003: Public health officials are investigating an
outbreak of influenza-like illness in a North Surrey residential care facility.
The outbreak at Kinsmen Place Lodge has been actively managed by Fraser
Health Authority and the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) since early
July and appears to be tapering off with just a few new cases identified in
the past week. Through July and early August [2003], 97 of 142 residents of
the facility have been affected, with most experiencing only mild cold-like
symptoms such as runny nose and cough. Of 160 staff, 46 have also shown
similar symptoms. The majority of residents and staff have fully recovered.
Although health officials are aware of the deaths of 7 residents over the
past 6 weeks, 4 of these deaths were unrelated. In 3 of the deaths,
pneumonia was a contributing factor.
"BC has a strong network of public health surveillance and health officials
take any disease outbreak very seriously," said Dr David Patrick, director
of epidemiology at BCCDC. "As with any situation where a large number of
patients and staff are affected by an outbreak, we are working to identify
the cause."
Fraser Health Authority is working with BCCDC, the provincial health
officer, and Health Canada to conclusively identify the cause. Tests
performed by the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg have yielded a range
of results for possible viruses, including positives for both human
metapnuemavirus and a virus similar to the SARS coronavirus. None of these
patients fits the profile of previous SARS cases in BC and Ontario earlier
this year.
"These laboratory findings are surprising given the nature of the
outbreak," said Patrick. "The symptoms and progression of illness are not
consistent with SARS infection and there is no evidence anyone related to
the outbreak has traveled to an affected area or had contact with a SARS
case. While the virus looks like the SARS coronavirus, it doesn't appear to
act like the SARS virus we've come to know," said Patrick.
As a precautionary measure and in addition to the infection control
measures already in place, Kinsmen Place Lodge will be considered a site
where transmission of SARS virus may have occurred in residents or visitors
since 1 Jul 2003. "Until such time as we determine the cause through sound
medical and clinical research, we are erring on the side of caution," said
Dr Roland Guasparini, medical health officer for Fraser Health Authority.
"Infection control procedures have been used as a standard practice during
the course of this outbreak. Given these recent lab results, there are
established protocols around SARS precautions that Fraser Health is
familiar with and will maintain."
Since the outbreak began in early July, full precautions have been taken to
limit the spread of the illness. The outbreak has been contained and the
rate of transmission and number of new cases has dropped to very low
levels. Kinsmen Place Lodge has had visiting and admissions restrictions in
place since the outbreak was first identified. Isolation precautions were
instituted around symptomatic patients and will continue. In addition,
staff have been directed not to work between different facilities and ill
staff have been directed not to work.
Visitors to Kinsmen Place Lodge after 1 Jul 2003 who have a cough and fever
over 38 degrees Celsius have been asked to contact BC NurseLine.

WHO rules out SARS as mystery illness at Canadian nursing home
--------------------------------------------------------------
VANCOUVER, British Columbia: - The World Health Organization said on Friday
that a pneumonia-like illness that sickened dozens of people at a British
Columbia nursing home probably was not SARS. 7 people have died, 3 of them
due to respiratory illness, since the unknown disease first appeared 6
weeks ago at the Kinsman Place Lodge in the Vancouver suburb of Surrey,
said Dr Shaun Peck, the British Columbia deputy medical health officer.
In Geneva, WHO spokesman Iain Simpson said some tests showed the cause
could be a virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, known as
SARS, but no other similarities exist. Simpson noted patients at the
nursing home lacked the high fever, breathing difficulties, and other
symptoms associated with SARS. "At the moment we don't exactly understand
what is happening," Simpson said. "They have found 10 positive results for
the SARS virus. We don't believe this is an outbreak of SARS but the local
authorities in Vancouver are taking a very conservative approach." The
illness could be a milder form of SARS than previously encountered, Simpson
said. "We are waiting for more information from Canada," he said. SARS
sickened almost 250 people, killing 44 of them, in two outbreaks this year
in Toronto, Canada's largest city. At the nursing home, 97 out of 142
residents and 46 of 160 staff members have fallen ill in the past 6 weeks,
Peck said Thursday.
Although laboratory tests showed some results for a corona virus similar to
SARS, Peck and others noted few similarities between the illness and SARS.
Those infected show mild, cold-like symptoms such as runny nose with no
fever, said Dr David Patrick of the British Columbia Center for Disease
Control. SARS patients generally develop high fever and respiratory problems.
The outbreak peaked on 29 Jul 2003 and has since tapered off, with the last
person developing symptoms 3 days ago, according to Patrick. None of the
affected staff members needed hospital admission, he said.

BC nursing home hit by SARS-like virus, dozens of patients, staff infected
--------------------------------------
VANCOUVER (CP): Federal and BC health authorities are looking into the
deaths of 7 people and the infection of dozens of others at a BC nursing
home hit by a mysterious, "SARS-like" respiratory virus. While stressing
this was not another outbreak of SARS, which killed more than 40 people in
the Toronto area this year, officials said they were treating like the
deadly form of pneumonia until they learn more about it.
The illness struck Kinsman Place Lodge in suburban Surrey, infecting 97 out
of 142 residents and 46 of 160 staff members over the last 6 weeks, Dr
Shaun Peck, BC deputy medical health officer, said on Thursday.
"There have been 7 deaths, although only 3 of them have been directly
associated with a respiratory illness," Peck told a news briefing.
Officials said nursing homes such as the Kinsman Place Lodge normally can
average 4 to 5 deaths a month. Preliminary tests from the National
Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg show the disease "appears to be a
SARS-like virus," said Peck. "Although clinically it is not an illness that
we associate with SARS, we felt obliged to let everybody know about it."
Staff and residents infected by the illness showed only mild, cold-like
symptoms such as runny nose with no fever, said Dr David Patrick of the BC
Centre for Disease Control. "This is not a typical SARS picture," he said.
He said 2 of the deaths being probed were patients already in palliative
care, 2 were from vascular causes and 3 others had pneumonia as a
contributing factor along with an underlying illness. Lab tests produced
some positive results for a SARS-like corona virus, said Patrick.
"These findings around a SARS-like virus from the lab are unexpected," he
said. "The outbreak hasn't behaved at all like SARS as manifested in Hong
Kong, Toronto, Singapore, Vancouver, et cetera, in the past." Peck said
this could be the SARS virus behaving less aggressively or a closely
related, less virulent virus previously unknown, or a SARS virus weakened
through genetic alternation. "All these possibilities remain and they need
to be clarified," he said.
Scientists at Winnipeg and the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta will try to identify the virus and compare it with
the known SARS virus. "In the meantime though and until this is clear,
we're playing it safe," said Peck. The outbreak was initially treated as
influenza -- common in nursing homes -- but tests for the flu virus proved
negative, said Dr Roland Guasparini, chief medical officer for the Fraser
Health Authority. Early tests for SARS also came back negative, he said.
But when the new results came in, precautions were stepped up, he said.
"Based on these preliminary lab findings ... we're going to consider this
long-term care facility as a site where transmission of SARS may have
occurred in residents or visitors since 1 Jul 2003," said Guasparini. He
noted there was no evidence the illness had been transmitted outside the
nursing home.
Guasparini said one patient remained isolated in hospital with pneumonia
and staff who were exposed are being tracked for possible quarantine and
observation. "We're going to adopt a very careful public-health approach to
this, as we did in the past, when we were investigating the cases of SARS
and suspect SARS that we had," he said.
Guasparini said the public should take normal precautions against the new
illness, such as reducing contact with others if one has cold symptoms and
maintaining hygiene. Visitors to the stricken nursing home who develop a
fever of more than 38 degrees, along with a cough, should telephone a local
public health hotline. Those who become seriously ill should contact their
doctors.
Symptoms shown by the nursing-home residents included cough, sore throat,
joint pain, muscle pain and extreme fatigue. The nursing home had a sign at
the front door Thursday warning visitors the facility was dealing with a
"respiratory outbreak," and recommending people do not enter.

[The description of the illness is that of a mild respiratory illness.
According to the numbers provided, there were 97 out of 142 residents
(clinical attack rate 68 per cent) and 46 of 160 staff members (attack rate
29 per cent) with 3 deaths (overall case fatality rate 2 per cent with a
case fatality rate of 3 per cent among residents). The attack rates are
very high, and the case fatality rate very low, especially among the
residents -- remembering that the case fatality rate among the elderly in
the SARS outbreak in both Hong Kong and Singapore was about 50 per cent or
higher). There is much room for speculation, including a change of the
virus to a less virulent form. There is also the possibility that as a
result of increased surveillance for respiratory illness, and the increase
in laboratory studies now conducted on outbreaks of respiratory illness,
that we will be identifying many "new pathogens" that we did not know about
in the past... a corollary of "seek and ye shall find". We await further
word on the virological studies related to this outbreak. - Mod.MPP
The results of the virological investigations provide no convincing
evidence so far that the SARS coronavirus responsible for the outbreak
originating in Guangdong Province in China is the etiologic agent in this
outbreak in British Columbia. Indeed there is no clear indication that a
single virus pathogen is involved. Many respiratory viruses are virtually
ubiquitous in the human population and can be responsible simultaneously
for respiratory illness in vulnerable groups such as those at risk in the
British Columbia outbreak. Nor is it surprising that a SARS-like
coronavirus has been detected, since 2 other human coronaviruses are
established respiratory pathogens, and others may exist. Characterization
of the SARS coronavirus indicates it is more similar to the group 2
coronaviruses (J Mol Biol 2003; 33: 991-1004), than to the group 1
coronaviruses. It will be interesting to see whether this putative
SARS-like coronavirus exhibits a similar relationship. - Mod.CP]
