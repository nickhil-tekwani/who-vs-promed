The FDA is working with officials in North Carolina and South
Carolina to investigate an outbreak of campylobacteriosis in 3 people
who consumed raw milk from Tucker Adkins Dairy in York, South
Carolina. The 3 confirmed cases and another 5 probable cases are from
3 different households and each case reports that prior to becoming
ill they consumed raw milk that was obtained from Tucker Adkins Dairy
on 14 Jun 2011. The onset of illness in these cases occurred in mid
June 2011. One person was hospitalized.

The FDA recommends that consumers only drink pasteurized milk. Raw
milk is unpasteurized milk from hoofed mammals, such as cows, sheep,
or goats. Raw milk may contain a wide variety of harmful bacteria
including _Salmonella_, _E. coli_ O157:H7, _Listeria_,
_Campylobacter_, and _Brucella_ that may cause illness and possibly
death. Public health authorities, including FDA and the CDC, have
expressed concerns about the hazards of drinking raw milk for
decades.

Most healthy individuals recover quickly from illness caused by raw
milk. However, some people may have more severe illness, and the
harmful bacteria in raw milk can be especially dangerous for pregnant
women, the elderly, infants, young children, and people with weakened
immune systems.

Since 1987, the FDA has required all milk packaged for human
consumption to be pasteurized before being delivered for introduction
into interstate commerce. Pasteurization, a process that heats milk to
a specific temperature for a set period of time, kills bacteria
responsible for diseases, such as listeriosis, salmonellosis,
campylobacteriosis, typhoid fever, tuberculosis, diphtheria, and
brucellosis. FDA's pasteurization requirement also applies to other
milk products, with the exception of a few aged cheeses.

>From 1998 to 2008, 85 outbreaks of human infections resulting from
consumption of raw milk were reported to CDC. These outbreaks included
a total of 1614 reported illnesses, 187 hospitalizations, and 2
deaths. Because not all cases of foodborne illness are recognized and
reported, the actual number of illnesses associated with raw milk
likely is greater.

Proponents of drinking raw milk often claim that raw milk is more
nutritious than pasteurized milk and that raw milk is inherently
antimicrobial, thus making pasteurization unnecessary. There is no
meaningful nutritional difference between pasteurized and raw milk,
and raw milk does not contain compounds that will kill harmful
bacteria.

Most people who get campylobacteriosis recover completely within 2-5
days, although sometimes recovery can take up to 10 days. Rarely,
_Campylobacter_ infection results in long-term consequences. Some
people develop arthritis. Others may develop a rare disease called
Guillain-Barre syndrome that affects the nerves of the body beginning
several weeks after the diarrheal illness. This occurs when a person's
immune system is "triggered" to attack the body's own nerves resulting
in paralysis that lasts several weeks and usually requires intensive
care. It is estimated that approximately 1 in every 1000 reported
cases of campylobacteriosis leads to Guillain-Barre syndrome. As many
as 40 percent of Guillain-Barre syndrome cases in the USA may be
triggered by campylobacteriosis. Although _Campylobacter_ infection
does not commonly cause death, it has been estimated that
approximately 124 persons with the infection die each year.

The raw milk associated with the illness was in 1-gallon containers
and was distributed in North Carolina by a courier. It is unknown
whether the raw milk may have been distributed in other states.

Raw milk is sometimes distributed in North Carolina via independent
or informal "milk clubs," though it may be distributed through other
means as well. The cases in this investigation report receiving raw
milk twice a month from a courier who delivered the milk from South
Carolina. While it is believed the full distribution by this courier
is limited, this information is not fully understood at this time.

FDA is investigating the problem in collaboration with the North
Carolina Division of Public Health and the North Carolina Department
of Agriculture and Consumer Services and the South Carolina Department
of Health and Environmental Control. The investigation is ongoing. The
FDA is also working with state authorities to take appropriate action
to address any product that may be remaining on the market.

[It is a violation of federal law enforced by the FDA to sell raw
milk packaged for consumer use across state lines (interstate
commerce). But each state regulates the sale of raw milk within the
state (intrastate), and some states, such as South Carolina, allow it
to be sold. This means that in some states, dairy operations may sell
it to local retail food stores or to consumers directly from the farm
or at agricultural fairs or other community events, depending on the
state law.

In states that prohibit intrastate sales of raw milk, some people
have tried to circumvent the law by "cow sharing," or "cow leasing."
They pay a fee to a farmer to lease or purchase part of a cow in
exchange for raw milk, claiming that they are not actually buying the
milk since they are part owners of the cow. Wisconsin banned
cow-leasing programs after 75 people became infected with
_Campylobacter jejuni_ bacteria in 2001 from drinking unpasteurized
milk obtained through such a program.

Classical zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_, _Brucella
melitensis_, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ species, _Listeria
monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ species, _Yersinia_ species, _Coxiella
burnetii_, and _E. coli_ O157:H7 are associated with raw milk
ingestion.

Non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_
Typhi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ species, _Salmonella_
Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from
_Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A have also been associated
with raw milk ingestion.

Other diseases that can be related to unpasteurized milk are
highlighted in these paragraphs extracted from Leedom JM: Milk and
Infectious Diseases in Humans. Clin Infect Dis 2006; 43: 610-5
(http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/507035) with the
citations renumbered to be consecutive starting from 1:

"In 1996 and 1998, there were 2 episodes involving rabid cows that
occurred in Massachusetts (1). Milk from rabid cows can contain rabies
virus, and transmission via unpasteurized milk is theoretically
possible. Temperatures reached during pasteurization kill the virus.
80 persons consumed unpasteurized milk that was collected from the 2
cows, and 9 more had contact with saliva from the cows. All 89 persons
received postexposure rabies prophylaxis, and no human cases of rabies
eventuated. A similar report in Oklahoma of possible rabies exposure
associated with the consumption of raw milk or cream from a rabid cow
was circulated in 2006 (2).

Tickborne encephalitis, a zoonotic arbovirus infection usually
transmitted to humans by the bite of an _Ixodes persulcatus_ or
_Ixodes ricinus_ tick, is endemic to Central Europe, Eastern Europe,
and Russia (3). However, the virus can be found in the milk of cows
and goats with tickborne encephalitis and was reported to be
transmissible to humans by the consumption of unpasteurized milk (4).
A case-control study failed to confirm oral transmission (5).

A diarrhea syndrome (later named Brainerd diarrhea) occurred among
122 residents of Brainerd, Minnesota, during the period December
1983-July 1984 (6). It was characterized by acute onset, marked
urgency, lack of systemic symptoms, failure to respond to conventional
antimicrobial agents, and a long median duration of illness (median
duration, 16.5 months). The syndrome was linked to consumption of raw
milk from a single dairy (6). No etiologic agent was ever isolated.
The outbreak of Brainerd diarrhea stopped when all of the dairy's
output was diverted and pasteurized (6, MT Osterholm, personal
communication).

Subsequent outbreaks in Illinois and Texas were not directly
associated with milk, although cattle had been in the vicinity of an
Illinois well that had its water implicated as a vehicle of
transmission (7). Another outbreak of Brainerd-like diarrhea, although
not associated with raw milk, affected 58 (15 percent) of 394
passengers aboard a cruise ship visiting the Galapagos Islands in
Ecuador (8).
