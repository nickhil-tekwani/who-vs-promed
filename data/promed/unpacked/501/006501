A recent occurrence of children with severe diarrhea in Indonesia's East
Nusa Tenggara (NTT) province has claimed 21 lives, mostly children, over
the last month. In the worst-hit area, Timor Tengah Selatan regency, 16
children reportedly died due to the diarrhea -- the cause of which was
still unknown to the health agency in the province.
In addition, 851 people were being treated in hospitals and health centers
with similar symptoms. In Kupang regency, 5 people have died, with their
deaths attributed to complications as a result of the same severe diarrhea.
Head of Timor Tengah Selatan regency's Health Office, Markus NG Righuta,
said on Wed, 31 Aug 2005, that 28 children with nearly identical symptoms
were still being treated at hospitals and community health centers.
"The provincial administration has assisted in dealing with the problem by
sending a medical team of 4 doctors and a lab analyst as well as extra
medicine to the regency," Markus said. East Java's environmental health
technology agency also sent in a team of 3 doctors, he added.

An outbreak of cholera has killed at least 22 people in Niger's northeast
region of Tahoua, the national health service said on Wed, 7 Sep 2005,
after rains brought further misery to the famished central African state.
Officials had identified 251 cases of the disease between 13 Jul and 5 Sep
2005 in Tahoua, 650 km (400 miles) northeast of the capital Niamey.
Millions of people in land-locked Niger, one of the world's poorest
countries, are still facing severe food shortages after a drought in 2004.
Long-awaited rains have helped crops but brought an epidemic of the deadly
bacterial disease.

[4] Bloody diarrhea, military convoy - Congo DR (Ituri)

The north eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) saw an
outbreak of diarrhee sanglante (severe, bloody diarrhea) this week
following last week's cholera plague, a UN official told Xinhua on Thu, 1
Sep 2005.
As of Tue, 30 Aug 2005, 132 cases of diarrhee sanglante have been reported
in the 4th brigade of the government forces, stationed in Bunia, capital of
the Ituri region, confirmed Michel Bonnardeaux, spokesman of the mission of
United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs to the DRC.
The brigade, consisting of 2 800 soldiers, was reorganized and deployed to
Ituri, when 800 troops were infected with cholera, leading to 30 deaths.
The Ituri region borders Uganda and is frequently haunted by tribal
violence. At present, the brigade suffers under harsh circumstances. There
are no tents, no food, and no drinking water available in the barracks,
sanitation and survival depending only on the inconsistent relief sent by
NGOs and UN peace-keeping troops.
Due to the impossibility of isolating the infected soldiers and their
family members, totaling up to 1700, under the current circumstances, the
plague may spread throughout the country, the UN mission to DRC warned. The
mission also called for the DRC government to offer necessary supplies to
the troops.
