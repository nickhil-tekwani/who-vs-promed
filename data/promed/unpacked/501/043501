POLIOMYELITIS UPDATE (09): RUSSIA ex TAJIKISTAN, NOT, CORRECTION

Dear Sir/Madam,
The Editor of ProMED,

Would you kindly note that the polio data regarding cases of polio in Russia (2) that you are currently posting from ProMED is 5 years out of date. The cases of WPV in Tajikistan and the Russian Federation were reported in 2010. Multiple synchronized immunization activities were successful in stopping transmission in 2010 and ending the outbreak that affected Tajikistan, Russian Federation, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan.

That said, would you urgently remove this posting from ProMED as it is incorrect and will indeed prompt inappropriate media coverage and enquiry? WHO and other Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) are concerned that this news item will cause particular concern now that the world is so close to achieving polio eradication.

We are aware of several media articles published on Friday, 11 December 2015 claiming "new" polio cases in two children from Tajikistan visiting the Russian Federation. All these articles date back to 2010, and have just re-surfaced now, for reasons unknown to
WHO.

We trust that you will take this appropriate action as soon as possible.

My sincere thanks,
--

[ProMED apologizes for this erroneous report, which was due to an incorrect media report. Indeed the alarming outbreak was covered in numerous ProMED reports beginning in May 2010 and was brought under control through intensive immunization activities.

Our thanks to the astute WHO EURO team who noted the error and sent a prompt correction. - Mod.LM]
