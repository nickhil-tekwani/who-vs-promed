The Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply (Mapa) has confirmed the outbreak of classical swine fever (CSF) in the state of Ceara, located in the northeast costal area of Brazil. It was the 1st confirmed outbreak in Brazil in almost a decade.

The case was confirmed on 6 Oct 2018 on a family farm, more than 500 km [about 310 mi] north of Brazil's CSF-free zone, which is recognised by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). 1st signs of the virus had become clear as early as 25 Aug 2018.

The official notification reports the 'backyard-like' farm had 130 animals, of which 115 contracted the illness and 112 had died. The other 3 animals were culled. Mapa's information also indicated the farm has no links with other commercial or breeding establishments for pigs.

The ministry said in a statement, "The occurrence does not change the international recognition granted to Brazil's CSF-free zone and does not justify impacts on the trade of pigs and their products. The procedures to eliminate the outbreak, with culling and destruction of the pigs, have been made and an investigation will take place in a 10 km [6 mi] radius and also in all properties with some epidemiological link."

The diagnosis was confirmed by the National Agricultural Laboratory through molecular techniques, performed on samples of an animal that had clinical signs of the disease.

Paulo Helder, president of the Association of Swine Producers of Ceara state (ASCE), said: "We were aware of the case yesterday [8 Oct 2018] and also of the authorities' action to isolate the area. We also formed a working group to clarify all the causes of this outbreak located in the city of Forquilho."

Recognised by the OIE this year [2017], Brazil's CSF-free zone covers 17 states and concentrates more than 95 percent of Brazilian swine production. Ceara is not one of them. The total export of Brazilian products and pigs comes from this free zone that has not been affected by CSF since January 1998.

The last time CSF occurred in Brazilian territories outside the free zone was in October 2009.

[Well this may be a bit alarming. It is not affecting the production system but it is likely causing some anxiety among the swine producers.

Classical swine fever is a contagious, often fatal, disease of pigs clinically characterized by high body temperature, lethargy, yellowish diarrhea, vomiting, and a purple skin discoloration of the ears, lower abdomen, and legs.

CSF has the potential to cause devastating epidemics, particularly in countries free of the disease. In these countries, vaccination is allowed only under emergency circumstances. In case of a new outbreak, strict measures are enforced to control spread, such as, culling of infected and disease suspect herds and strict movement restrictions. This can have severe consequences for the swine industry, especially in densely populated livestock areas. Awareness and vigilance are essential, so that outbreaks are detected early and control measures instituted rapidly to prevent further spread of CSF. The "high risk period," that is, the time between introduction of the virus and detection of the outbreak, must be kept as short as possible.

CSF is caused by a small, enveloped RNA virus in the genus _Pestivirus_ of the family Flaviviridae. The virus (CSFV) is moderately fragile and does not persist in the environment or spread long distances by the airborne route. However, it can survive for prolonged periods in a moist, protein-rich environment such as pork tissues or body fluids, particularly if kept cold or frozen. Virus survival times up to several years have been observed in frozen pork meat. CSFV may also survive months in chilled or cured cuts.

Countries free of CSF usually implement preventive measures to avoid outbreaks of CSF by controlling movement of live animals and pork products at borders. Countries free of CSF forbid the use of prophylactic vaccination. In countries where CSF is endemic, prophylactic vaccination is regularly practiced and is mandatory in some cases. Prophylactic vaccination has been used worldwide as a tool to control and eradicate CSF. In these countries, herds affected by an outbreak are quarantined and if possible eliminated. Emergency ring vaccination around the outbreak is done to prevent further spread of CSFV. CSF live attenuated vaccines are safe and highly efficient, being able to induce protection shortly after vaccination (within 3 days after vaccination). Several live attenuated vaccines, such as the Chinese lapinized vaccine (C-strain), the Japanese GPE-strain, and the French Thiverval strain, have been developed and used in different countries. More recently, subunit CSFV vaccines containing only the major viral surface glycoprotein of the virus have been licensed. Although these vaccines have DIVA [immunological differentiation of the infected from the vaccinated animals] capabilities, they lack the efficiency of live attenuated vaccines. Oral vaccination of wild boars has been used successfully within the European Union using a live attenuated vaccine delivered via baits. Oral vaccination has been a key strategy to control CSF, particularly where parenteral vaccine delivery is not feasible.

We hope this does not turn into a full outbreak. - Mod.TG
