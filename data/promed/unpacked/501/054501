FMD detected in Isakeeva village
--------------------------------
A cow belonging to a local farmer in the village of Isakeeva, Kochkor
district, Naryn region, has been found infected with FMD [virus]. The
Republic's veterinary control services at the Ministry of agriculture
issued a confirmation statement. The specimen was sampled on 20 Feb
2010 and the testing was based upon serology. There had been a
previous reports of FMD in Bishkek region. The authorities affirm
that the epidemiological FMD situation is fully under control in
Kyrgyzstan. The veterinary authorities of Kyrgyzstan previously
announced that they carried out a surveillance activity in the border
with Uzbekistan and claimed that FMD is being imported from
Uzbekistan. However, after a follow up Uzbekistan authorities
declared the allegations as baseless.

[Kochkor district, in the northern part of the central region of
Naryn, is more than 350 km [217 mi] distant from the Uzbek border;
for maps, see <http://healthmap.org/r/0195> and an administrative map
at <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/kyrgyzstan_pol_05.pdf>.

The last FMD outbreaks reported by Kyrgyzstan to the OIE date back to
May-July 2007, affecting cattle with serotypes A and O in the
provinces Batken and Chuy; the disease was, reportedly, continuing
during the 2nd semester of 2007 and the 1st semester of 2008. No
later reporting from Kyrgyzstan is available on the OIE website.

Uzbekistan's semiannual an annual reports stated the absence of FMD
until mid 2008; no later reports are available.

Since the diagnosis of the current outbreak in the Naryn oblast is,
according to the newswire, based upon serology, final confirmation of
the disease is pending; has clinical disease been observed? Are
samples for virological investigation available, to confirm a recent
active disease and to obtain the necessary information on the
serotype involved? has an outbreak in Bishkek been laboratory
tested/confirmed? Have samples been forwarded to a reference
laboratory? has vaccination been applied? - Mod.AS]
