Officials with the Jackson County Health Department are currently investigating 51 cases of hepatitis C -- 10 times the number of cases normally reported in a month. The increase in the discovery of hepatitis C is being attributed to free testing conducted as a result of the HIV and hepatitis C outbreak in Scott, Jackson, Clark, Perry, and Washington counties, according to a news release from the health department.

At least 79 cases of HIV have been reported in that outbreak, and most have been traced to people sharing needles used for injecting Opana [oxymorphone], a pain medication. Hepatitis C can be spread by sharing needles for injecting drugs, tattooing, or piercing. It also can be sexually transmitted, but that is less common. Reports indicate many more cases of hepatitis C may exist and simply have not been confirmed or diagnosed.

[2] Needle exchange programs

Evidence that HIV and hepatitis C are spreading among intravenous drug users is prompting more state and local officials to consider setting up needle exchanges -- including some who had been resistant to such programs. The problem comes in tandem with rising intravenous use of heroin and prescription painkillers nationwide.

In Kentucky, Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear last week [25 Mar 2015] signed a bill into law aimed at combating the state's epidemic of heroin and painkiller abuse. One provision allows local health departments to set up needle exchanges after obtaining approval from city and county governments.

And in Indiana, a surge in HIV cases linked to injecting the prescription painkiller Opana [oxymorphone] in a rural county prompted Republican Gov. Mike Pence to declare a public-health emergency last week [26 Mar 2015]. He issued an executive order authorizing the temporary dispensing of clean needles in Scott County, near the Kentucky border, despite his personal opposition to such programs and a state law barring them.

Exchanges allow drug users to anonymously obtain clean syringes and dispose of used ones. The aim is to help people avoid sharing needles that may be contaminated with viruses or other pathogens.

Political opposition to such exchanges can run deep, especially in conservative areas. While backers contend the programs reduce the transmission of disease and potentially connect addicts with treatment programs, opponents say they sanction drug use and dissuade users from seeking help. Now, "the opiate epidemic is changing the political calculus around syringe exchanges," said Daniel Raymond, policy director at the Harm Reduction Coalition, an advocacy organization on health issues related to drug use.

Other states and municipalities have helped pave the way for needle exchanges. In the past few years, Nevada passed a measure allowing them, while 2 cities in Ohio have set them up -- Cincinnati and Portsmouth, both on the Kentucky border. This year, Florida lawmakers are weighing a proposal to launch a pilot needle-exchange program in Miami-Dade County.

The US has about 200 syringe programs in 33 states and the District of Columbia, according to the North American Syringe Exchange Network, a nonprofit. The White House Office of National Drug Control Policy supports such exchanges. Federal funding for them is banned by law, but they can receive local, state and not-for-profit funding.

While the HIV outbreak in Indiana alarms public-health experts, many worry more about hepatitis C. It spreads more easily among people who share needles and other injection equipment than HIV does, because it can live outside the body longer, said Kathie Kane-Willis, director of the Illinois Consortium on Drug Policy. Hepatitis C can survive outside the body for at least 16 hours, and possibly up to 4 days, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said; HIV doesn't survive long outside the body.

[Most diagnoses of hepatitis C are not finding newly infected patients as almost all are already chronically infected. Although in many areas it is a political "hot potato", needle exchange programs are effective in decreasing transmission of blood-borne viruses such as hepatitis B and C and HIV by avoiding sharing of needles. There is no evidence to support that such programs increase the use of illicit injectable drugs. - Mod.LL]
