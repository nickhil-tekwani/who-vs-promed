Crow in Osaka confirmed to have H5N1 bird flu virus
-----------------------------------------------------
A national laboratory has confirmed the bird flu virus detected in a
crow caught in Osaka Prefecture is the same highly virulent H5N1
strain that hit a poultry farm in neighboring Kyoto Prefecture,
laboratory officials said Monday.
The National Institute of Animal Health in Tsukuba, Ibaraki
Prefecture, has found the virus is the H5N1 strain, the same as the
type detected at Asada Nosan Co's Funai farm in Tamba in Kyoto and
other locations in Japan contaminated with bird flu.

Bird Flu Persists in Thailand, 11 Provinces Affected
----------------------------------------------------
Bird flu is stubbornly hanging on in Thailand, officials said on
Sunday, dashing hopes that the country would soon be free of the
epidemic that has killed 7 Thais and led to the culling of millions
of chickens.
Thailand, the world's 4th-largest poultry producer and one of the
worst-hit countries, had hoped to declare the epidemic over by next
week. But officials now say that may not happen until April 2004.
"We've found that chickens have still died in certain areas," Deputy
Agriculture Minister Newin Chidchob told reporters, adding that tens
of thousands of birds have been culled in the 11 affected provinces
since early March 2004.
"We may not be able to declare the epidemic over next week," Newin
said. "We expect all of the areas to become green zones in April if
nothing wrong happens."
Thailand, which has culled about 35 million chickens to prevent the
spread of the deadly H5N1 avian influenza strain, is eager to revive
its shattered poultry industry and resume annual exports worth $1.5
billion.
Newin said exports of cooked chicken could resume next week to Japan,
the biggest buyer of Thai poultry.
Previous outbreaks of bird flu in Europe and the United States took 6
months to bring to heel, and the OIE -- the world animal health body
-- has cautioned against excessive optimism in Asia, saying H5N1
probably would be around for months.
At the height of the outbreak in Thailand, authorities declared 400
"red zones" in 42 of its 76 provinces. An area must go 21 days
without a new outbreak before it can be downgraded to an uninfected
"green zone."
Newin said 27 provinces were declared bird flu free on Sat, 13 Mar
2004, but it would be another 69 days before farmers could start
restocking their farms.
Despite the disease appearing to be on the retreat, the U.N.'s Food
and Agriculture Organization has urged affected nations not to
restock poultry farms too quickly to prevent the disease from flaring
up again.
Bird flu spread across much of Asia over the last few months, killing
at least 15 people in Viet Nam and 7 in Thailand, and forcing
authorities to slaughter more than 100 million birds to halt the
advance of the epidemic.
Vietnam said last week its outbreaks had been contained and it
planned to begin restocking farms.
