Recently, there have been outbreaks of pig disease in some parts of China.
The enthusiasm of breeders has taken another hit, weakening breeder demand
for soymeal in the short term. Sources say that pig disease is
comparatively serious in the Guangdong region. Local industry insiders say
that, in addition to highly pathogenic blue ear disease, there is also an
outbreak(s) of a not well-known [alternatively, "unknown"] disease for
which vaccines are not so effective, [creating] a rather substantial new
assault on local breeders.

[Experience has shown that apparently non-significant, poorly detailed,
indirect media reports on animal health issues, when originating from
regions such as Guandong, should not be ignored. Additional information,
confirmatory (with more details) or otherwise, would be welcomed. - Mod.AS
