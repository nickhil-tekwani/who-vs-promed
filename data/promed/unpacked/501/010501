A local man has been sickened by a rare form of flesh-eating bacteria linked to fish from grocery store tanks. This is the 2nd such case in the area recently; a woman was sickened by _Vibrio vulnificus_ in November 2016 after cutting her hand while preparing tilapia purchased at a Bellevue seafood store. The woman sickened in the Bellevue case eventually recovered.

In this most recent case, King County health officials say the man, who is in his 40s, cut his hand while preparing the fish. He bought the fish at the Seattle Supermarket on Beacon Hill. The store has discarded all its fish and cleaned out fish tanks. Health investigators are working to find the source of the contaminated product. Still, the "flesh-eating version" of vibrio is rare. The CDC tracked about 900 infections in the USA between 1998 and 2006.

There is another possible case of _Vibrio vulnificus_ on the Gulf Coast. A local teen is in the hospital battling a flesh-eating bacterium on his hand. So far in 2017, there have been 4 confirmed cases in Mobile County, 2 from the waters near Dauphin Island and the others from consuming raw oysters.

It's too soon to know for sure whether this teen's case is actually _Vibrio vulnificus_, but both he and his mom tell FOX10 News that all the red flags are there. "I don't want to be in here, but I have to," said the 16-year-old in a phone video chat from his hospital bed at USA Children's and Women's. He has been up all night taking anti-bacterials every few hours for 2 lesions on his hand.

"They started him on the IV anti-bacterials right away. They did lots of blood work," said the teen's mother. "They said it takes a week or so to get an actual positive test back, but they are treating it as though it is a flesh-eating bacteria." The teenager says it started with a small cut on his finger from football practice, a cut that was almost healed until he went swimming off Dauphin Island on Fri 14 Jul 2017. He said his skin surrounding the cut started blistering. "It was getting better, but when I jumped in the water, it ended up getting worse," he said.

Health experts say exposing an open wound to salty/brackish water increases the chances of contracting _Vibrio vulnificus_, a "flesh-eating" bacterium that lives in the warm Gulf water. If not treated fast enough, the bacteria can have devastating effects. After hearing about the at least 4 other cases in Mobile County, the boy's parents weren't taking any chances. They rushed him to the ER at Mobile Infirmary. "They [the doctors] are looking for signs of healing and no more spreading," said the mother.

A spokesperson with the Mobile County Health Department also couldn't confirm yet whether this case is due to _V. vulnificus_, but he says the department will start looking into it.

The following is extracted from the "Bad Bug Book," Center for Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM297627.pdf#page46:

"_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.

Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis.

The "primary septicemia" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70 percent of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions (shown at http://safeoysters.org/medical/diagnosis.html)."

There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination) and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can involve more northern geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave. - Mod.LL
