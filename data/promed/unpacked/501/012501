Coffee leaf rust (CLR) has been tentatively identified on Maui. The Hawaii Department of Agriculture (HDOA) has received preliminary results from the University of Hawaii identifying the fungus on plants collected from managed and wild coffee. Samples have also been sent to the US Department of Agriculture on the mainland for official confirmation of this federally regulated pathogen.

CLR is one of the most devastating pests of coffee plants and is established in all of the other major coffee-growing areas of the world but had not previously been found in Hawaii. HDOA is continuing its survey on Maui and statewide as well.

"It is unknown at this time how the rust got to coffee plants on Maui or how long it has been there," said Phyllis Shimabukuro-Geiser, HDOA. "We appreciate the assistance of the multiple agencies that are helping us to determine the extent of this infestation and how CLR may have been introduced into the state."

[Coffee leaf rust (CLR; also called orange rust) is caused by the fungus _Hemileia vastatrix_, one of the most feared pathogens of the crop. Of the 2 coffee species grown commercially, _Coffea arabica_ (arabica or highland coffee) and _C. canephora_ (robusta or lowland coffee), CLR affects only arabica varieties, which are usually preferred for their taste. The rust has completely destroyed coffee industries in several countries. The disease is characterised by yellow-orange powdery lesions on the underside of leaves, where it attacks through stomata, but it rarely occurs on stems or fruit. CLR can lead to complete defoliation with death of the host plant.

Fungal spores are spread by wind, rain, and mechanical means. Disease management relies mainly on multiple fungicide applications during the rainy season. Rust-resistant cultivars exist, but the crop is generally of poorer quality. More than 30 races of the fungus have been detected, making it particularly difficult to establish durable host resistance.

New fungal strains adapted to higher-altitude conditions, which may also show additional fungicide resistances, have emerged in Central America, making CLR control in the region considerably more difficult (for example, see ProMED-mail posts 20170515.5038218 and 20120920.1301244). Generally, fungal spores that are wind-borne or can easily be carried on travellers' clothes, such as for CLR, pose a very high biosecurity risk.
