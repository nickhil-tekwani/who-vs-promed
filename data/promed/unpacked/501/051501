A Comment from Dr M Katz of the Mississippi Valley Regional Blood Center
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The use of the term "blood transfusion" in the posting archived as
"Hepatitis B virus, blood transfusion, 2003 - Japan 20030914.2326" is not
correct. I am confident the posting is referring to plasma derivatives, not
blood components for transfusion. The difference is not trivial, and this
should be clarified by the moderator. [The moderator has no precise
information to impart beyond that contained in the 2 press reports, which
may in any case have suffered distortion in translation. The heading "blood
transfusion" was used to allow cross-referencing with the reports of an
incident in the year 2000 in Japan (see below). Dr Katz's clarification of
terminology and description of the processing of blood donations are
welcomed by ProMED-mail. - Mod.CP]
In most of the world, plasma derivatives are made from pooling up to tens
of thousands of units of donated plasma. This plasma may be either "source
plasma", which is obtained by automated methods from paid donors, or
"recovered plasma", which is the plasma removed from whole blood donations
given by volunteer (unpaid) donors. Paid donors have higher rates of
infection with transfusion-transmissible viruses, but after pooling, the
pools are subjected to any of a variety of viral inactivation procedures
(for example, pasteurization, nanofiltration, chromatography) that have
rendered the risk of infection from these pools negligible since the late
1980s.
These derivatives include intravenous immunoglobulin to treat primary
immunodeficiencies and some autoimmune syndromes, albumin, and coagulation
factor concentrates, used mainly in the treatment of the hemophilias.
Derivatives from these huge pools, prior to the mid-1980s before effective
screening and viral inactivation, were of course the source of tens of
thousands of HIV and hepatitis infections, but viral transmission in the
face of viral inactivation procedures applied under the kinds of process
control required in most of the developed world is extraordinarily unusual.
Process failures leading to contamination of large lots of derivatives,
while rare, remain capable of exposing large numbers of recipients, as is
the apparent concern in this posting.
Transfusable blood components are the labile cells and coagulation factors
from whole blood donations. These mainly include red blood cells,
platelets, and fresh frozen plasma. They cannot undergo viral inactivation
procedures, since that would destroy the therapeutic content of the
component. Neither are they pooled in usual practice, so the implications
of a virally infected donation extend only to the 2 or 3 recipients of the
undetected infected donation. To deal with real and theoretical risks from
transfusable components, blood collection facilities in the developed world
employ stringent process controls, donor historical screening, reliance on
volunteer donors, as well as sensitive and redundant laboratory assays.
Viral inactivation techniques that target the nucleic acids of potential
pathogens in transfusion components are under development and in various
stages of regulatory review around the world, but are not yet in wide use
due to a variety of concerns around a number of cost and risk-benefit
controversies.
