Sarawak [in east Malaysia] records a remarkable drop in the number of dengue
cases this year, Assistant Minister of Environment and Public Health Dr Soon
Choon Teck said in an interview with Tribune yesterday. He said the number
of dengue cases in the State had dropped from 701 last year to 366 this
year, for the January to July 10 period. Only 11 cases of the more
life-threatening dengue haemorrhagic fever were detected so far this year
[compared with ? - Mod.CHC] , he disclosed.
However Dr Soon said the ministry had warranted that all the relevant
departments continue keeping vigilance to further bring down cases of
dengue in the city, towns, districts and the rural areas.

[At a recent joint public health conference, countries in the region,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, all noted a decline in the
number of dengue fever/dengue haemorrhagic fever (DF/DHF) cases in 1999,
after many years of increasing incidence. Brunei apparently has no DF/DHF
problem. - Mod. CYC]
[This is the principal reason we need data before making declarative
statements about attack rates declining as a result of vector control
measures. If attack rates are declining in other places where such measures
are not being applied, then one cannot conclude that the efforts were
effective. - Mod CHC]
[Can anyone tell us if Brunei has a dengue control program? - Mod.JW]
