Parasite infects 80 000 MD trout; Whirling disease forces killings at
hatcheries and lowers spring stocks
-----------------------------------------------
A parasite that deforms the spines and skulls of trout -- making them
swim in circles often until they die -- has infected 80 000 fish in 2
hatcheries in Western Maryland, state officials said yesterday [14
Feb 2007].
The "whirling disease," which has devastated trout populations in
Western states, has also been found downstream from the 2 Maryland
hatcheries, in the North Branch of the Potomac River, said Bob
Lunsford, director of freshwater fisheries for Maryland Department of
Natural Resources.
"We are testing all of the places that we know have wild trout
populations so we can get a handle on how widespread this parasite
is," Lunsford said.
State officials killed the 80 000 infected fish at the Bear Creek
Rearing Station near Accident and in another privately owned hatchery
used by the state in southern Garrett County.
The result will be that state officials will be stocking streams and
lakes across Maryland this spring with about 20 percent fewer rainbow
and brown trout, meaning fishermen will have fewer to catch, Lunsford
said. Last year [2006], the state stocked 197 streams and ponds with
418 250 trout.
The parasite, _Myxobolus cerebralis_, is not a risk to humans or
other fish, Lunsford said. He said it might have been spread to the
hatcheries by mud on the feet of birds or bears.
Nathaniel Gillespie, a fisheries scientist with Trout Unlimited, a
nonprofit group, said the invasive species was spread from Europe to
the United States in the 1950s. It hit Colorado and Montana hard and
has spread to 22 states including Pennsylvania, Virginia and New York.
"It has had some devastating effects on wild trout populations across
the country," said Gillespie. "It's pretty grotesque. You see them
swimming in a circle, because their spines are crooked."
The microscopic protozoan was 1st detected in Maryland 12 years ago
in a state trout-raising facility in the North Branch of the Potomac.
The fish being held in nets at the "growing out" facility (where
trout are fed until large enough for release) had apparently picked
up the parasite from wild trout in the river, Lunsford said.
State biologists isolated the infected fish in a 20-mile stretch of
the river, between dams at Jennings-Randolph Lake and Westernport,
Lunsford said.
But last month [January 2007], test results came back showing
thousands of infected fish several miles away at the hatcheries. "It
was terribly depressing," Lunsford said.
The Bear Creek center receives about 150 000 young rainbow trout from
other hatcheries and raises them until they are large enough for
release. Employees this winter noticed that many young fish, about 3
months old and 1 1/2 inches long, were acting oddly. "They have
peculiar whirling swimming patterns, and it looked like they were
spinning," Lunsford said.
The parasites live in the skulls and spines of fingerling trout,
warping their bodies, deforming their heads and blackening their
tails. The fish that survive into adulthood carry the parasites and
reproduce, then shed millions of spores into the water when they die,
according to the Whirling Disease Foundation. The spores are then
eaten by tiny worms, which carry the parasites until they grow and
infect fish.

[This would appear to be a great leap in geography from the states in
the Western United States that have traditionally been plagued with
this problem. The question then becomes, how was it transmitted to
this area, or has it only reached a level such that we are now seeing
clinical signs? - Mod.TG]
