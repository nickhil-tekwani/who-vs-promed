At a recent Harrison-Clarksburg Health Department meeting, hepatitis B rates were a notable topic of discussion. Nursing Director Margaret Howe stated that the department has already seen 17 acute cases of hepatitis B this year [2013], when, typically, there are 2-3 acute cases a year. Acute cases are considered "new" and not people who have previously contracted the disease.

She said the amount of intravenous drug use in Harrison County is contributing to the increase. "After contracting hepatitis, you can't donate blood, organs, tissue or anything," Howe said.

Hepatitis B is a blood disease and can be transmitted through sharing bodily fluids and blood, such as in sex, sharing needles, and exposures on the job. The disease can also be transmitted from mother to child. Howe said hepatitis B can lead to liver failure and death if combined with an autoimmune deficiency.

Currently, there is a vaccine for hepatitis A and B, but none for C. The hepatitis B vaccine is typically given at birth, and most schoolchildren should have full immunity with it. Even with the vaccine, Howe said some precautions are necessary: Do not share personal items, and be cautious of tattoo shops.

[Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused hepatitis B virus. It can cause chronic liver disease and chronic infection and puts people at high risk of death from cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. A vaccine against hepatitis B has been available since 1982 and is 95 percent effective in preventing infection and its chronic consequences.

Hepatitis B virus can cause an acute illness with symptoms that last several weeks, including yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, extreme fatigue, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Hepatitis B prevalence is highest in sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia. Less than one percent of the population in western Europe and North America is chronically infected, the low level being attributable to comprehensive vaccination programmes. In addition, implementation of blood safety strategies, including quality-assured screening of all donated blood and blood components used for transfusion, can prevent transmission of hepatitis B virus. The increase in acute cases of hepatitis B in West Virginia is being attributed to an increase in intravenous drug misuse locally in the Clarksburg area.

Clarksburg is a city in and the county seat of Harrison County, West Virginia, United States, in the north-central region of the state. It is the principal city of the Clarksburg, WV Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population of the city was 16 578 at the 2010 census.
