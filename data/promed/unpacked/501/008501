From: Thomas Walton <Thomas.E.Walton@aphis.usda.gov>

ProMED-mail moderators: It is with sadness, but also with great
excitement that I advise you of my retirement on 3 Jan 2006. I do not
know who APHIS will assign to funnel information to you or to provide
official responses to questions that you and the ProMED-mail readers
ask, but I am sure that the name of that contact will be provided
soon.
It has been a personal and professional pleasure and a privilege to
have been able to work with all of you. While some of the questions
you have asked have been difficult to answer, and some of the
challenges you have conveyed have been uncomfortable to address, in
every case, you have been respectful, courteous, civil, responsible,
and professional in your interactions with me and with APHIS. I shall
miss our interactions and the mental stimulation of trying to write
an accurate, logical, politically correct, and publicly acceptable
response that was factually correct and scientifically- or
programmatically-based.
All of you are friends, as well as colleagues who I trust, admire,
and respect. We have had a (generally) fun run, have privately and
collectively shared a few laughs, have been honest with each other
and with ourselves, and hopefully, have provided a needed and valued
service to our constituents and to our respective organizations.
While I am retiring and am gone from APHIS, I hope that I am not soon
forgotten.
Warmest wishes for the holidays.

[ProMED deeply appreciates Dr. Walton's kind words and, more
importantly, his devotion to transparency and the search for truth.
We will miss him and wish him all the best in his retirement. -
