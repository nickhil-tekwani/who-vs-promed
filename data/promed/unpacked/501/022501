A slightly elevated occurrence of hemorrhagic disease, or bluetongue
virus, is partially responsible for a decrease in deer harvests this
year [2011] in Western Tidewater and other areas of Virginia, experts
say.

Aaron Procter, a district wildlife biologist with the Virginia
Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, said 2 percent to 3 percent
of deer in the Tidewater area are affected by bluetongue. [In all
probability the disease is actually epizootic hemorrhagic disease.
This disease, while closely related to bluetongue, is a different
virus and much more prevalent in deer than bluetongue. - Mod.TG]
"We've had pockets of the disease in Isle of Wight and Southampton
counties," he said. "Some hunters are crediting low deer counts with
(bluetongue) and in pockets of Tidewater that may be the case."

However, Procter added that warmer temperatures and the occurrence of
full moons during the deer mating season, known as the rut, could also
be contributing to a 10 percent to 15 percent decrease in harvests
statewide this year [2011].

Procter said warmer weather means less herd activity during the day
and more activity at night, when hunters aren't out.

"There's not a lot of deer activity during the day," Procter said. He
added that the decrease could also be the result of hunters finally
getting "on top of the deer herd in southeastern Virginia."

Bluetongue virus is a naturally occurring disease in deer, with
outbreaks happening almost every year. The disease is spread by biting
midges, or biting flies, and there are no direct health effects on
humans, Procter said. "There are no consumption concerns, but we
advise people that if something doesn't look right, you shouldn't eat
it," Procter said.

The disease typically occurs from mid-August through October. Many
affected deer appear normal or show only mild signs of illness, but
the signs change as the illness progresses. Initially, animals may
seem depressed, feverish and have a swollen neck, according to the
department's website.

All deer appearing to be ill should be reported to the department at
804-367-1258.

[Let us hope the agencies and the people involved in the deer deaths
are not speculating on which disease they are dealing with. This
article does not mention any type of testing to determine the
disease.

While epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHD or EHDV) is closely
related to bluetongue virus, they are antigenically very different
viruses. EHD more often affects cervids. Bluetongue virus more often
affects cattle. While either virus can and occasionally does cross
into the other species, it is much more likely that EHD is the cause
of these animals dying. Hopefully, someone will provide us with some
testing information. Dr William Wilson has developed a PCR test that
clearly demonstrates the differences between these 2 viruses.
