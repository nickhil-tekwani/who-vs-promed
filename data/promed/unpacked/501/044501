Kween district is under surveillance after cases of anthrax, which started last month [April 2021].

Health officials in the district say that 15 of 19 people are undergoing treatment, and over 15 head of cattle have so far succumbed to the disease.

Phily Musobo, the Kween district Surveillance Officer told Uganda Radio Network (URN) that the disease broke out on 12 Apr 2021 after 6 people reported to Atar HCIII after reportedly eating meat from a dead cow which had died on 7 Apr 2021.

He cited the affected villages of Chekwosum, Sukut and Kaptokolo in the 2 parishes of Kaptoyoy and Toswo of Kaptoyoy sub county, Ngenge Sub County, Giligi and the neighbouring sub counties, where the disease is said to have originated and spread to Kaptoi and Kwosir.

He noted that one person succumbed to the disease late last month [April 2021]. The victim was from Kapchorwa where the disease is said to have spread.

Musobo said that the disease is fast spreading but that the district is struggling to facilitate the response to the outbreak due to lack of funds. He also cited the lack of cooperation from the community despite intensive social mobilization conducted.

Anthrax is an acute zoonotic disease historically described as occurring in 4 forms: cutaneous, inhalation, gastrointestinal and injection anthrax, depending on the route of exposure. It is transmitted through contact with infected livestock or wild animals, with their carcasses, with their tissues or parts of the animal, or possibly transmitted by biting flies having fed on such animals.

The disease is also transmitted through contact with parts from infected animals, such as hair, wool, hides, or bone, or via products made from these parts (drums, brushes, and rugs), or through contact with contaminated bone meal. Contact with soil contaminated by infected animals is rarely reported as a source of exposure.

The incubation period differs by form of anthrax: Cutaneous (average 5-7 days with a range of 1-12 days); Inhalation (1-43 days with a range of 1-60 days); Gastrointestinal (incubation ranges from 1-6 days); and Injection (incubation of 1-10 days or more).

["Anthrax is a rare but serious illness caused by a spore-forming bacterium, _Bacillus anthracis_. Anthrax mainly affects livestock and wild game. Humans can become infected through direct or indirect contact with sick animals.

"There's no evidence anthrax is transmitted from person to person, but it's possible anthrax skin lesions may be contagious through direct contact or through contact with a contaminated object (fomite). Usually, anthrax bacteria enter the body through a wound in the skin. You can also become infected by eating contaminated meat or inhaling the spores.

"Signs and symptoms, which depend on how you're infected, can include skin sores, vomiting and shock. Prompt treatment with antibiotics can cure most anthrax infections. Inhaled anthrax is more difficult to treat and can be fatal.

"There are 4 common routes of anthrax infection, each with different signs and symptoms. In most cases, symptoms develop within 6 days of exposure to the bacteria. However, it's possible for inhalation anthrax symptoms to take more than 6 weeks to appear.

"Cutaneous anthrax
A skin-related (cutaneous) anthrax infection enters your body through your skin, usually through a cut or other sore. It's by far the most common route of the disease. It's also the mildest. With appropriate treatment, cutaneous anthrax is seldom fatal. Signs and symptoms include:
- A raised, itchy bump resembling an insect bite that quickly develops into a painless sore with a black center
- Swelling in the sore and nearby lymph glands
- Sometimes, flu-like symptoms including fever and headache

"Gastrointestinal anthrax
A gastrointestinal anthrax infection results from eating undercooked meat from an infected animal. It can affect your gastrointestinal tract from your throat to your colon. Signs and symptoms include:
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Abdominal pain
- Headache
- Loss of appetite
- Fever
- Severe, bloody diarrhea in the later stages of the disease
- Sore throat and difficulty swallowing
- Swollen neck

"Inhalation anthrax
Inhalation anthrax develops when you breathe in anthrax spores. It's the most deadly form of the disease and is often fatal, even with treatment. Initial signs and symptoms include:
- Flu-like symptoms for a few hours or days, such as sore throat, mild fever, fatigue and muscle aches
- Mild chest discomfort
- Shortness of breath
- Nausea
- Coughing up blood
- Painful swallowing
- High fever
- Trouble breathing
- Shock: an acute medical condition involving collapse of the circulatory system
- Meningitis

"Injection anthrax
This recently identified route of anthrax infection has so far been reported only in Europe. It's contracted through injecting illegal drugs. Initial signs and symptoms include:
- Redness at the area of injection (without an area that changes to black)
- Significant swelling
- Shock
- Multiple organ failure
- Meningitis."

These affected people likely had the gastrointestinal form, or perhaps some may also have had the cutaneous form. However, what is sad and disturbing is that these villagers would consume a dead animal which died of some cause other than humane slaughter.

From the article, it is unclear whether the deceased animal had been lying around deteriorating and was consumed recently, or the deceased animal was consumed when it was fresh carcass. Or have the villagers forgotten the risks involved in butchering and eating the meat from dead cattle? Thus, these human cases, and the importance of maintaining public awareness of the risk. Public health is at risk when communication breaks down, or poverty and starvation exceed common sense.

The living animals need to be vaccinated to prevent more dead animals and a repeat of this community illness.

Anthrax can spread to animals through the bite of flying insects carrying the bacteria, or through spores in the soil the animals may consume through grazing or licking of areas on the ground for minerals. If the soil is contaminated, vaccination of the living animals will need to continue for many years to forever, as the spores of this disease are extremely resilient.

An anthrax outbreak with human involvement occurred in 2020 as well. - Mod.TG
