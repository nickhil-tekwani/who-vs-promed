China Confirms New Human Case of Avian Influenza
-----------------------------------------------
The Chinese Ministry of Health on Wed 23 Nov 2005 confirmed another
human case of H5N1 bird flu in eastern China's Anhui Province. This
is the 3rd confirmed human case of bird flu reported in China.
A 35-year-old woman farmer in Xiuning County of Anhui developed fever
and pneumonia-like symptoms on 11 Nov 2005 after contacts with sick
and dead poultry. She died on 22 Nov 2005. Tests of [samples from]
the woman were H5N1-positive, stated China's Center for Disease
Control and Prevention. The Ministry has reported the new confirmed
case to the World Health Organization (WHO), according to the WHO
Beijing Office. It has also informed Hong Kong, Macao and some other
countries.
China on 16 Nov 2005 confirmed the 1st 2 human cases and one
suspected case of H5N1 avian influenza virus infection. The 2
confirmed cases involve a 9-year-old boy in Xiangtan County of Hunan
Province, central China, and a 24-year-old woman farmer in Zongyang
County of Anhui Province in the east. The boy has been discharged
from the hospital after recovery. The woman died on 10 Nov 2005. The
boy's 12-year-old sister, who had similar symptoms as her brother and
died on 17 Oct 2005, was reported as a suspected human case. [This
girl was cremated immediately following death, and no samples are
available to confirm the provisional diagnosis. - Mod.CP]
"There is no proof of human-to-human transmission of bird flu in the
world so far," Chen Xianyi, head of the contingency office of the
Ministry of Health, told the Xinhua News Agency in an interview.
China has reported 24 bird flu outbreaks this year [2005] and has
culled millions of poultry and intensified prevention and control
efforts. Vice Minister of Agriculture Yin Chengjie said on Mon 21 Nov
2005 that China is facing a "severe" situation in fighting bird flu.
The government vowed last week to vaccinate all its 14 billion
poultry to fight the epidemic. On Tue 22 Nov 2005, the State Food and
Drug Administration approved its homemade human avian influenza
vaccine for clinical test, saying pre-clinical trials show the
vaccine is fairly safe and effective.

[This new fatal case of avian influenza virus infection, the 2nd in
the eastern Anhui Province, brings the total number of human cases in
China to 3 and the number of fatalities to 2. This 2nd fatal case in
Anhui province has yet to be confirmed independently by a
WHO-designated laboratory. Further information would be appreciated
concerning the nature of the "homemade" human avian influenza
vaccine; presumably a hen's egg-propagated inactivated preparation? -
