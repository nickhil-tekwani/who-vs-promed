Montana has recorded its 1st case of West Nile virus this year [2018]. The state veterinarian's office confirmed the virus in a horse in the Roundup area. Local veterinarian Maryrose Beasley says the horse had been weak and stumbling around.

Beasley told the Billings Gazette she had previously treated horses with West Nile virus and recognized the signs. Beasley also advised horse owners to have their animals vaccinated against the virus.

West Nile virus typically emerges in Montana in August and September. The virus is carried by mosquitoes and can be transmitted to people. The virus can cause a mild fever, headaches and body aches in humans.

A total of 2 cases of West Nile virus (WNV) [infection] have been reported in Johnson County, Kansas, although health officials say those in north and south east Kansas are only at a moderate risk of catching the disease [Another report https://www.hayspost.com/2018/07/31/kdhe-reports-first-west-nile-virus-cases-in-kansas-for-2018/ describes these cases as "neuroinvasive". - Mod.SH]. The Kansas Health Department says risk of being bitten by an infected mosquito is highest in north central, south central, north west, and south west Kansas.

About 20 per cent of those who contract WNV infection will develop a fever and headache, weakness, muscle pain, arthritis-like pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and a rash 2-14 days after a bite from an infected mosquito. Roughly one in 150 infected people develop the more severe version of the disease, which includes swelling of the brain and, in some cases, death. There currently are no vaccines or medications to manage the virus. Elderly people and those with a weakened immune system are most at risk.

"Although for most people West Nile virus may not cause a great deal of concern, we encourage residents, especially our vulnerable populations, to take steps to prevent infection because of the potential for complications," said Dr Greg Lakin, chief medical officer, Kansas Department of Health and Environment.

You can protect yourself by using insect repellent on your skin and clothing, including DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or IR3535. Make sure you have good screens on your windows and doors to keep out mosquitoes. Get rid of mosquito breeding sites by emptying standing water from flower pots, buckets, and barrels. Change the water in pet dishes and replace the water in bird baths weekly. Drill holes in tire swings so water drains out. Keep children's wading pools empty and on their sides when not being used. Horses can also be infected with the disease. Talk with your veterinarian about vaccinating your horse to protect them against WNV.

Most WNV infections occur in the late summer and early fall. As of 24 Jul 2018, 39 cases of human WNV have been reported nationally. There have been more than 600 cases of the most severe form of WNV and 30 deaths in Kansas from 1999 through 2017.

[The virus's appearance seems to be following historical timelines in Montana and likely in Kansas as well. There is a very effective vaccine for horses. The vaccine is often combined with those for eastern equine encephalitis, western equine encephalitis, and tetanus. Generally, it is given as 2 injections about 3-4 weeks apart. In addition to vaccination, there are sprays for use on the horse to prevent mosquito bites.

If the virus is circulating in horses, it will also be in humans. Protect yourself and your animals and eliminate mosquito breeding places, which may be any location of standing water. These locations may include old tires or catch pans on potted plants. Eliminate these breeding sites, and it will help decease the mosquito population. But please vaccinate your horse(s). - Mod.TG
