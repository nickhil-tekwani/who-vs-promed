Papaya (pawpaw) crops in the Western Division have been hit by phytophthora root rot, a disease caused by extremely wet conditions and water-logged fields.

Agricultural officer Sugrim Chand said the outbreak in the country's biggest papaya producing area, the Sigatoka Valley, was cause for serious concern. "The valley accounts for 85 percent of our papaya production. If the wet weather continues, we will see repercussions to the industry on a large scale because of the threat to plants and fruit," he said.

He said, because of the disease outbreak, papaya exports were stringently screened for traces of disease to ensure recently acquired markets such as Australia are not compromised. Mr Chand is optimistic that papaya exporters can meet market requirements if all stakeholders work together.

[Phytophthora root rot on papaya is caused by the fungus-like organism _Phytophthora palmivora_. The pathogen attacks roots, stems, and fruit and can completely destroy a crop. Disease development is favoured by wet soil conditions. Symptoms include fruit rot and premature fruit drop, as well as root and stem rot leading to yellowing, wilting, and collapse of leaves, and eventual death of the plants. Roots are often completely destroyed and diseased trees emit a rotting smell. Plants can be infected at all ages but roots of young seedlings are most susceptible.

The pathogen is soil borne and can also be spread by plant material (including fruit, hence the increased biosecurity requirements mentioned above), mechanical means, water, and wind. Disease management may include cultural practices (soil drainage, crop rotation), phytosanitation (removal of pathogen reservoirs, quarantine measures), and use of clean planting material. Early fungicide treatments can reduce fruit rot and may make it possible to harvest some of the fruit from affected plantings, but will not save the mother plant.

_P. palmivora_ is known to affect more than 150 tropical hosts including many crops and also causes, for example, black pod of cocoa and bud rot of palms.
