A 61-year-old woman from northern China was confirmed on Saturday [20 Jul 2013] as having contracted the deadly H7N9 bird flu virus, Xinhua reported. The woman, from the city of Langfang in Hebei province, developed a cough and fever on [10 Jul 2013] and 4 days later was given a diagnosis of severe pneumonia, the official Xinhua news agency reported, citing a Beijing municipal health bureau statement. The woman is receiving emergency treatment in a Beijing hospital, Xinhua said, citing the statement as saying she had frequently purchased vegetables at a local market where live poultry is also on sale. So far, 9 of the woman's family members who have had close contact with her have not exhibited flu symptoms, the report said.

The 1st human cases of the H7N9 virus were reported in late March [2013] and it had infected 132 people in mainland China, killing 43, by the end of June [2013], according to the latest available official figures. While new case numbers have dropped off recently, experts remain on guard for fear the virus could mutate into a form easily transmissible between humans, with the potential to trigger a pandemic.

Official media reported Friday [19 Jul 2013] that a Chinese woman who spent 5 weeks in intensive care with H7N9 bird flu had given birth to a girl in what was described as a "miracle" 1st.

A woman from north China's Hebei Province Saturday [20 Jul 2013] became the latest confirmed case of the H7N9 strain of bird flu, said health authorities in Beijing. The 61-year-old from the city of Langfang, Hebei, developed symptoms including cough and fever on [10 Jul 2013] and was diagnosed as suffering from severe pneumonia 4 days later, the Beijing municipal health bureau said in a statement. Her condition did not turn better after treatment and she was therefore transferred to an intensive care unit in Beijing Chaoyang Hospital on Thursday [18 Jul 2013]. She was confirmed positive for the deadly H7N9 bird flu strain on Saturday [20 Jul 2013] and is currently under emergency treatment. Before developing the illness, the woman often bought vegetables from a local farm produce market near her home where live poultry are sold, the statement said. The 9 family members who have had close contacts with her have not shown any flu symptoms.

Earlier 132 human cases of H7N9 avian flu were reported on the Chinese mainland, including 43 that have ended in death, after the virus was first discovered in March [2013], according to updates released by the National Health and Family Planning Commission on [10 Jul 2013].

[The Ministry of Health of People's Republic of China reported on 10 Jul 2013 that in the month of June 2013, there was only one confirmed case, and there were a total of 132 confirmed cases in mainland China as of 30 Jun 2013. The new case is the 1st case reported since that date. The probability is that the new case contracted infection directly from an avian source rather than from another human.

The above reports add nothing of substance to the previous report from Beijing, other than that the patient was in the habit of purchasing vegetables from a local farm market, which could have been the site of her exposure to the virus. None of 9 close family members have shown symptoms of influenza. More detailed information regarding the source of the patent's infection is awaited. - Mod.CP
