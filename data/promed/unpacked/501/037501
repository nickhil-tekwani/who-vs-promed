_Naegleria fowleri_ claims life of woman in Karachi
------------------------------
The amoeba, _Naegleria fowleri_, which causes an encephalitis claimed a woman's life on Thursday [9 Oct 2014] as a man affected by the illness continued to fight for his life at a private hospital, said health officials.

The patient, [a 25 year old female], was brought to the Aga Khan University Hospital a day earlier [8 Oct 2014] with high fever and was later diagnosed with Naegleria. She passed away while being treated at the hospital.

Karachi Health Director Dr Zafar Aijaz said the deceased was a resident of Taiser Town Karachi. Another patient, [a 45 year old male], also tested positive for the illness and was currently admitted for treatment in Liaquat National Hospital. The doctors said [he] was unconscious and had been placed on a ventilator.

[Pakistan is reporting more cases at present than any other country. It is important that the diagnosis rests on solid ground with Naegleria fowleri DNA being demonstrated in cerebrospinal fluid or brain biopsies. Concerning possible routes of transmission it is discussed in the ProMED moderator's comment in prior ProMED-mail post Amebic meningoencephalitis, primary - Pakistan (03): 20140903.2746573. - Mod.EP]
