A young man has died in Joypurhat [Jaipurhat is an alternative spelling] with symptoms of Nipah virus [infection], taking the toll of such deaths in the district to 6. The victim, a sales representative with a pharmaceutical company, died at Joypurhat hospital on Thursday [26 Jan 2012].

The district's civil surgeon Dr Mozammel Haque told bdnews24.com that the man had been admitted to the hospital a few days ago with severe fever and headache after taking date juice and plum. The doctors later sent him to Rangpur Medical College Hospital as his condition deteriorated, Dr Haque said. He passed away while on his way to the hospital, he added.

"We have sent the samples to IEDCR (the Institute of Epidemiology Diseases Control and Research) to confirm whether the deadly virus caused his death," the civil surgeon said. The hospital authorities also sent blood samples of three children who are currently under treatment to the IEDCR, he said.

On Tuesday, IEDCR confirmed that Nipah virus caused the death of 5 children in the district. Of the 5 deaths, two are from Khetlal upazila and the others from Joypurhat municipality.

Nipah virus had claimed the lives of at least four people in the northwestern district last year. It causes severe illness characterised by inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), respiratory disease, seizures, vomiting and fainting.

According to the experts, Nipah generally spreads between December and April when fruit bats perch on the jars used for collecting the sap of palm or date trees. They usually leave saliva and droppings in the jars. People are infected when they drink raw juice, thereafter it spreads through person to person contact. Experts advise against drinking unprocessed date extracts, as fruit bats, the natural host of the Nipah virus, could contaminate the juice. They also advise not eating partially eaten fruits, wash them before eating and washing hands after coming into contact with patients.

[This is a continuation of the outbreak published on 24 Jan 2012 [see proMED-mail archive number 20120125.1022056]. The source of the virus is the same as the previous cases -- contaminated palm juice. In some areas in Bangladesh, local residents construct a type of reed or bamboo skirt made of locally available materials around the juice collecting jars that prevent the fruit bats from having access to it. This is a simple, inexpensive measure to prevent transmission of the virus.

_Pteropus_ giant fruit bats ("flying foxes") are the natural hosts of Nipah virus, and virus shedding occurs when females are pregnant or lactating.
