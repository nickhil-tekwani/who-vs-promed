----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I saw many cases of anthrax in pigs in both the Eastern Highlands and the Lumi area of the Sepik District of PNG when I worked as a veterinarian in that country from 1954-1964. Clinically the disease was characterized by swelling of the pharyngeal region. Most pigs developing this sign died within a few days. In the outbreaks I investigated, village people told me that between 10 and 20% of their pigs died. They knew and feared this disease, attributed it to "poison" but recognised its contagious nature.

I isolated _Bacillus anthracis_ from the affected area of the head but not from peripheral blood. These isolates had most of the physical and biochemical characteristics previously described for the organism. It was capsulated and readily formed spores. I tested its virulence for mice, guinea pigs, goats, cattle and pigs. The LD50 dose of spores needed to kill mice and guinea pigs was similar to that described elsewhere. Goats were susceptible and developed bacteraemia. Pigs and limited numbers of cattle were resistant to large doses of injected organisms. I was not able to infect pigs per os -- the most likely route of infection naturally. Pigs were shown experimentally to resist challenge after inoculation with commercial anthrax vaccine.

The description of pig anthrax in PNG and its organism as somehow different followed the submission of cultures by the Australian Army Veterinary (not Medical) Survey Unit to HR Carne of the faculty of veterinary science, University of Sydney (not CSIRO). Carne identified some differences from Australian isolates in the biochemical characteristics of the PNG samples. He also questioned their virulence for guinea pigs and noted their inability to form spores. These factors and the apparent absence of human cases led to his decision that the disease and its organism were "atypical". My conclusion was different. The disease I saw in pigs was very similar to that described in other countries. The organism I cultured and examined was similar in virulence for laboratory animals to those examined elsewhere. I developed a malignant pustule from which I isolated _B. anthracis_ after a limited autopsy on a goat. My conclusion was that the disease was anthrax, without qualification. How pigs acquire the disease, and why their owners don't, remain to be resolved.

[ProMED-mail is highly indebted to Prof Egerton for sharing with our subscribers the above firsthand, historical invaluable information.

As previously informed (20070305.0781), an animal health team was dispatched last weekend [20-21 Apr 2019] to investigate the reported mass pig mortality event in Nipa, Southern Highlands, PNG. The team's findings and, hopefully, diagnosis are expected. In the meantime, the event's status remains "undiagnosed". - Mod.AS]

[Anthrax is endemic in the Highlands -- traditionally in East Sepik, Madang, Chimbu, and Southern Highlands but since 1998 is now reported in Western Highlands and parts of the highlands region of Morobe -- but it is absent on the coast near Boroko, close to the veterinary service laboratory. Local accounts have it only affecting pigs. Logically PNG is overdue for genomic typing and niche mapping. Decades of cycling in pigs will have swung the genes to optimise porcine infections in the Highlands. - Mod.MHJ
