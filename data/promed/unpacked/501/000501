[1] Vietnam, cormorants - request for information

30 cormorants in a bird sanctuary in Vietnam's southern Dong Thap province
have suddenly died recently, prompting the local authorities to close all
wild bird eco-tourism sites, local media reported Tuesday [15 Nov 2005].
The black cormorants died in Gao Giong, one of the most famous eco-tourism
sites in the Mekong Delta, and specimens from the birds are being tested
for bird flu viruses, newspaper Youth quoted Duong Nghia Quoc, vice
director of the provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Development,
as saying.
The provincial authorities will officially close all wild bird sanctuaries,
including Tram Chim national park, the stork garden of My An, and the 2
eco-tourism sites of Gao Giong and Xeo Quyt, to prevent potential bird flu
spread to humans as well as protect the birds.
Recently, Vietnam's 2 biggest cities, the capital Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh
City in the south, ordered residents of their inner areas not to raise
ornamental birds as of 15 Nov 2005 and 30 Nov 2005, respectively.
Early in November 2005, the Vietnamese government decided to cease import
of all kinds of poultry, including ornamental birds and related products
that have not undergone temperature or chemical treatment, from bird
flu-hit countries.
Since 1 Oct 2005, bird flu has been detected in 85 communes in 14
localities, killing and leading to the forced culling of nearly 440 000
fowl, according to Vietnam's Veterinary Department.
Vietnam has detected 65 human cases of bird flu infections, including 22
fatalities, in 25 cities and provinces since December 2004, the Health
Ministry announced on 15 Nov 2005, noting that the accumulated numbers of
bird flu infections and fatalities since December 2003 are 92 and 42,
respectively.
The government has just decided to allocate additional 1 trillion 306
billion Vietnamese dong (VND) (over 82.6 million US dollars) for combating
bird flu outbreaks in humans this year. The Vietnamese Ministry of Finance,
on 10 Nov 2005, said it ensured a budget of 4 trillion 915 billion VND (311
million dollars) to realize an urgent plan to cope with bird flu in humans,
including more than 1 trillion VND (63 million US dollars) to be used from
now to the end of 2005 for the prevention.

[Dr Martin is gratefully acknowledged for sending the above newswire and
for providing the following informative observations:
"There are 3 species of cormorant in Indochina: little cormorant,
_Phalacrocorax niger_; Indian cormorant, _Phalacrocorax fuscicollis_; and
great cormorant, _Phalacrocorax carbo_. Each of these appears to be
resident in neighbouring Cambodia, although other populations of great
cormorants are known to be migrants. Indian cormorant is the commonest of
the 3 in Cambodia".
Great cormorants have been mentioned as one of the species found infected
with HPAI H5N1 in Lake Qinghai, northern China, in May 2005. The exact
identity of the involved birds and results of their laboratory tests will
be appreciated. - Mod.AS]

Xianghai National Nature Reserve, a major habitat of migratory birds in
north east China's Jilin Province, has closed off all of its scenic spots
to prevent tourists from [being exposed to] avianborne diseases. [map at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/CH/5/Xianghai.html>].
"It's necessary to close the nature reserve in order to reduce contact
between humans and birds," Bao Jun, deputy director of Xianghai National
Nature Reserve Administration, told Xinhua in a telephone interview on
Saturday [12 Nov 2005].
Jilin -- adjacent to bird-flu-hit Liaoning Province and the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region -- has strengthened inspection and quarantine to keep the
disease out of the province.
The wetland reserve of Xianghai, the Momoge Nature Reserve in the province,
and Zhalong Nature Reserve in Jilin's neighbouring Heilongjiang Province
are the 3 major protection areas for cranes.
Xianghai, the home of 253 kinds of rare birds including some 60 red-crowned
cranes, is on the flight route of migratory birds, which increases the
province's risk of bird flu outbreaks. "Groups of migratory birds have been
flying south over the wetland these days," said Bao, noting that the
reserve administration has taken measures to strengthen surveillance of the
birds.
The birds living in the reserve [wild birds, or domestic birds maintained
within the reserve? - Mod.AS] have been injected with anti-bird flu
vaccines, said Bao, adding that 10 observation stations and a 60 person
surveillance team have been set up, carrying out round-the-clock watch on
the birds. "The migration of birds will last for another couple of days,"
Bao said, "The risk of bird flu will decrease after the end of migratory
season."

[3] Kuwait, flamingo - response
Date: Thu, 17 Nov 2005
From: David Melville <david.melville@xtra.co.nz>

The Directory of Wetlands in the Middle East lists 2 coastal sites in
Kuwait where greater flamingos have been recorded.
<http://www.wetlands.org/inventory&/MiddleEastDir/KUWAIT.htm>
Ringing (banding) of greater flamingos at Lake Rezaiyeh, Iran in the early
1970s provided considerable information on movements. These are summarised
by Argyle (1975) and Scott (1975). Birds banded at this site were
subsequently recovered from widely dispersed locations, ranging from
Turkey, Libya, Syria and Iraq, to Sudan and Ethiopia, and to Pakistan and
India. There were no recoveries from Kuwait, but birds were recorded from
Dubai, Bahrain, and Oman. Scott noted that 7 adult flamingos ringed at the
Lake Tengiz colony, Kazakh SSR, and 2 ringed on migration at Gasan Kuli
Reserve, Turkmen SSR, had been recovered in Iran. Regarding movements of
juveniles he noted: "The scatter of recoveries indicates that, rather than
following well-defined migration routes, young flamingos undertake an
extensive dispersal, generally southwards".
It would be of interest to know the age of the bird found dead -- as with
all reports of wild birds found dead.

[4] Kuwait, flamingo - response
Date: Thu, 17 Nov 2005
From: Nial Moores <spoonbillkorea@yahoo.com>

Looking at the image of the flamingo in the Al-jazeera news article, it
seems clear that at least some flamingo are kept and traded as pets in
either Kuwait or the wider region. This combined with a dead imported
falcon found at the same time in Kuwait (after apparently bird imports were
banned...) suggests something is not quite right with this story.
(<http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/FA3B331E-5772-4669-B43F-B957351DC2CB.htm>)
It would seem very useful to try to find out how widespread importing or
trapping and keeping of pet birds is in Kuwait, and whether such species
include flamingo; whether the beach was indeed a beach (most flamingo feed
in shallow saline lagoons, with one key site in Kuwait for greater flamingo
appearing to be the Jahra East sewage outflow area -- not exactly a beach
area, and one reached by a long drive down semi-closed tracks); and how the
bird was actually "found" (dead or alive for example, might provide some
useful insight; in a populated or a remote area is another).
I believe that there is a specialised working group on flamigoes, and also
know that the Wetlands and Wildfowl Trust in the UK have much information
on flamingo as well as other waterbird species, their ecology and their
distribution.

[We are indebted to Dr Reuven Yosef, director, International Birding &
Research Centre in Eilat, Israel, <ryosef@eilatcity.co.il>, for the
following additional information:
1. The greater flamingo (accurate Latin name _Phoenicopterus ruber_) is
very migratory.
2. Flamingos migrate during the day -- this is known from the soaring bird
migrations conducted at Eilat since 1977.
3. Note that they are also known to breed in India and Iran, such that the
Kuwait bird could be from the east or from Turkey to the north.
In view of the concerns related to the current HPAI panzootic and its
zoonotic impacts, there is a clear need to encourage and increase the
interdisciplinary cooperation between virologists, epidemiologists,
ornithologists, ecologists, physicians, and veterinarians. - Mod.AS]
