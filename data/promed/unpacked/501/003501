The recently identified MCR-1 resistance gene that disables the last-line antibiotic colistin has further spread beyond China to distant regions, even Africa, rather quickly and could be spreading in the food supply, prompting urgent calls for a global ban or restrictions on use of the drug in agriculture.

Those were some of the findings in 5 brief reports [1-5] published yesterday [17 Dec 2015] in The Lancet Infectious Diseases in response to its report a month ago on the MCR-1 gene's 1st identification in China [6]. The fast-moving developments come on the heels of an announcement yesterday from Dutch researchers that the country, like Malaysia, Portugal, Denmark, and England, has the gene in bacteria collections.

Authors of one of the Lancet Infectious Diseases reports said they have found the gene in healthy human gut samples from China from before 2011, suggesting that it may have been in the country for a while.

Findings from bacteria collections
----------------------------------
Three of the Lancet studies briefly describe new tests on bacterial collections. In one of them, a consortium from the Netherlands looked at bacteria in fecal samples from 2002 Dutch people before and after they traveled between November 2012 and November 2013. 6 isolates had the MCR-1 gene in _Escherichia coli_ [1].

Two of the travelers who weren't related to each other had been to Peru and Bolivia, 2 other unrelated people took trips to China, one went to Tunisia, and one had visited Thailand, Viet Nam, Laos, and Cambodia. None of the 6 received medical care during their trips, and none had taken antibiotics during travel.

Researchers said their findings point to a worrisome spread of the MCR-1 gene in _E. coli_ across at least 3 continents.

In another report, a team from France screened for the MCR-1 gene in _E. coli_ isolates from people in several countries (Laos, Thailand, France, and Nigeria), pigs in Laos, and poultry from Nigeria [2]. Their analysis found the gene in 19 isolates, of which 12 were identical to the gene identified in China.

"We clearly show that plasmid-mediated colistin resistance has spread beyond China to the neighboring southeast Asian countries and even further to Africa where colistin is widely used in animal production," they wrote, adding that because colistin is widely used in animal production, including in Europe, resistance has likely spread worldwide.

They said prompt actions are needed to curb use of the drug in agriculture to avoid further spread, similar to what occurred with NDM-1 5 years ago.

In the 3rd study, investigators from France and Texas screened 8684 French agricultural _Salmonella_ samples that were collected from 2012 through 2013 [3]. They identified the MCR-1 gene in 4 colistin-resistant isolates. It was found in unrelated _Salmonella_ isolates, though all were from the O:4 serogroup, which they said could be a coincidence, but warrants further investigation.

They wrote that their findings, echoing those of others, reinforce the need to reconsider the use of colistin in veterinary medicine.

More mobile than previously reported?
-------------------------------------
In a separate Lancet report, Hong Kong researchers looked in greater depth at a _Salmonella_ Typhimurium isolate collected from a 2011 food sample in Portugal that carries the gene [4].

They said the gene's location on the _Salmonella_ Typhimurium plasmid differs from that found in the affected _E. coli_ isolates in China, suggesting that the MCR-1 gene can transfer to other plasmid types, possibly expanding its bacterial host range. Also, the team wrote that they found other evidence that the _Salmonella_ plasmid that carried MCR-1 may have also originated in China and that horizontal gene transfer may have occurred recently.

"This finding is highly alarming as it implies that dissemination to a geographically distant region has occurred in a short time," they said, adding that the bulk of the findings so far make a strong case for curbing agricultural use of colistin.

MCR-1 found in human gut microbiome
-----------------------------------
Two Chinese researchers who looked at datasets comprising 1267 human fecal samples found the MCR-1 gene in 3 Chinese human gut microbiomes that were presumably sampled before 2011 [5]. They said the findings hint that the gene may have been in China a long time and has already spread to the healthy human gut, an antibiotic gene reservoir that carries a high horizontal gene transfer potential.

Their search also turned up the gene in a _Salmonella_ isolate from a 2011 Portuguese food sample.

Taken together, the findings raise concerns that the worldwide distribution of the MCR-1 gene might be underestimated, the pair wrote.

They warned, "Collectively, the widespread distribution of the MCR-1 gene in meat and food samples, and its presence in the human microbiome, strongly suggest a potential food chain dissemination pathway, which warrants immediate worldwide attention."

New Dutch findings, plus more to come
-------------------------------------
And in related news, Dutch researchers yesterday [17 Dec 2015] reported that they found the MCR-1 gene in a bacteria dataset from the Netherlands, among _Salmonella_ isolates collected in 2014 and 2015, according to a statement from Wageningen University that was translated and posted by FluTrackers, an infectious disease news message board [6]. 2 were from chicken meat and 1 was from imported turkey meat.

Meanwhile, Lancet Infectious Diseases signaled today [18 Dec 2015] on its Twitter feed [7] that it would soon publish another wave of reports on MCR-1.

Epidemiologists -- people who track diseases -- use an expression: Seek and ye shall find. It's a reminder that sometimes when you see a phenomenon, it may not be entirely new. It may be that you've only just noticed it.

Well, the world seems to be having a major seek-and-ye-shall-find moment right now with a worrisome new superbug.

This week alone reports have emerged that the mcr-1 gene, which confers resistance to an important antibiotic of last-resort, has been found in bacteria previously collected in the Netherlands, Laos, Algeria, Thailand, and France. There is reason to believe it may also be circulating in Bolivia, Peru, Tunisia, Portugal, Malaysia, and possibly Viet Nam and Cambodia.

The journal that has published many of these findings, the Lancet Infectious Diseases, indicated on its Twitter feed [Fri 18 Dec 2015] that it has more mcr-1 reports in its hopper: "There will be another wave of reports soon."

This is in addition to Denmark [1] and Britain [2]. Scientists in those 2 countries reported finding the bacterial resistance gene earlier this month [December 2015]. All these findings have come to light in the month -- one single month -- since Chinese scientists made the 1st-ever report of mcr-1.

This week, the Lancet Infectious Diseases published 5 more reports of work done by researchers in a number of countries who searched their databases for mcr-1. [See item 1 above for these references.] A group from the Netherlands identified the gene in _E. coli_ found in stool samples collected from 6 travelers who had been on 3 different continents: South America (Bolivia, Peru), Africa (Tunisia), and Asia (Thailand, Laos, Viet Nam, and Cambodia.)

The travelers took part in a study in which stool samples were collected before and after foreign travel, providing a nice reminder that an antibiotic-resistant gene such as mcr-1 can journey the world over in the stomachs of healthy people while no one is the wiser, said Lance Price, director of the Antibiotic Resistance Action Center at George Washington University. Price said he hopes the rapid discovery of the gene across such a large expanse will serve as a wake-up call.

Mcr-1 is a gene that gives bacteria that carry it resistance to a drug called colistin, the last antibiotic that can cure highly resistant infections. From a human point of view, that's a very bad skill for bacteria to have. But it gets worse: this gene is carried on a plasmid, a mobile piece of DNA that that can be swapped from one bacterium to another within a family like _E. coli_, but also to other bacterial families as well.

This gene can get around. And it clearly has been. After Chinese researchers reported the 1st discovery of mcr-1 on [18 Nov 2015], researchers with access to databases containing the genetic sequences of _E. coli_, _Salmonella_, and other bacteria scrambled to search those collected codes for evidence of mcr-1. The hope, of course, was that this bug was contained to China. Not even close, it turns out. 2 weeks later Danish researchers reported finding the gene in samples taken from one hospital patient and 5 commercial meat products. The earliest evidence of it in Denmark was from 2012. "I had really sincerely hoped not to see it," Frank Aarestrup, head of the genomic epidemiology group at Denmark's National Food Institute, told STAT the day he and his colleagues reported their finding. The poultry meat in Denmark that turned up mcr-1 containing _E. coli_ had been imported from Germany, which adds to the evidence that this gene is hopscotching around the globe.

Colistin is actually not a great antibiotic -- it can be toxic to the kidneys. In fact, for decades, it was rarely used. Other, newer antibiotics were easier to take, so doctors in the main stopped using colistin, which is probably why it still works. As the newer, better drugs have fallen prey to resistance, colistin has gained a new place of prestige in modern medicine. The World Health Organization actually declared it critically important for human medicine in 2012. But China has been using the drug in agriculture, which is what likely led to the development of mcr-1, experts believe.

Price said the emergence of mcr-1 and the evidence of its wide spread is proof the time has come to draw some firm boundaries between the antibiotics that should be reserved for human use and those that can be used to treat infections in animals.

Feeding antibiotics to pigs, cows, and other food animals as growth promoters, or to prevent the diseases that arise as a result of industrialized production practices, simply shouldn't be allowed, he said.

These developments come in a week when Congress upped spending on antibiotic resistance, increasing the pot being shared by a number of federal agencies by USD 303 million -- a 64 percent bump. One might be tempted to see that as a sign that the US government is seized of the threat antibiotic resistance poses to modern medicine. But Price noted that none of that extra money was allocated to the Department of Agriculture, even though the agricultural sector uses many times more antibiotics than human medicine does. He thinks it is a sign of continued resistance to the need to limit agricultural use of antibiotics. "They do not want clear lines drawn," Price said.

[The mcr-1 gene encodes for resistance to colistin. See my moderator comments in prior ProMED-mail posts below for a discussion of colistin resistance.

The news reports above document the multi-continent spread of the mcr-1 gene that is located on mobile genetic elements (plasmids) in Gram-negative bacilli. Until recently, the use of colistin in human medicine was limited to predominantly topical administrations due to its toxicity if given systemically, and availability of safer antimicrobial agents. With the development of severe nosocomial infections due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacilli, colistin in the form of its inactive pro-drug, colistin methanesulphonate became the antibiotic of last resort drug in human medicine to treat life-threatening infections due to these MDR pathogens.

However, colistin apparently has been used regularly in veterinary medicine for decades. Use in animal husbandry is not restricted to China. In the EU, the drug has been administered orally in feed or in drinking water, the route by which the drug demonstrates poor systemic absorption. The drug is used since the 1950s in some EU countries for group treatment of food-producing animals for infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae in rabbits, pigs, poultry, cattle, sheep, and goats (http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Report/2013/07/WC500146813.pdf).

Colistin-resistant organisms, once emerged, has been shown to potentially persist in the absence of selective pressure from this drug (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/53/4/373.long). In 2013, the European medicines Agency reviewed the use of colistin products in animals within the European Union (http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Report/2013/07/WC500146813.pdf). They recommended, "detailed monitoring of colistin resistant bacteria is required to confirm horizontal gene transfer is not involved and overall prevalence remains low. As soon as colistin resistance determinants are found on mobile genetic elements in the bacteria of concern as well as from human or animal origin, or a clonal explosion of virulent bacteria takes place, a new risk assessment would be required." It is obvious that the time has come, if it is not already too late. - Mod.ML]
