The European badger has become the new animal to watch with regard to bovine tuberculosis, after a large team of researchers from the University of León, the Institute of Mountain Livestock, the Complutense University of Madrid, research centers of the Principality of Asturias or the Federal University of Brazil, among others, demonstrated after 13 years of study that the presence of large populations of badgers could be related to a higher probability of _Mycobacterium bovis_ maintenance.

Ana Balseiro, scientist from the University of León and leader of the study, said that in any locality where bovine TB is at high prevalence "alternative hosts must be investigated, whether domestic (goat, sheep) or wild (boar or deer). If badgers are present, this species should also be included in surveillance efforts."

In Salamanca, the veterinary units of Béjar and Vitigudino exceeded a 5% prevalence of bovine tuberculosis in the 2021 livestock sanitation campaign. Balseiro pointed out that the detection of TB in badgers will depend upon several factors, as they may be relevant for some communities but not for others.

"Among other factors, the prevalence of the disease in cattle depends on the badger density, the presence of badgers in the vicinity of farms, and on the biosafety measures applied. In any case, adds Balseiro, epidemiologic surveillance in badgers will determine whether animals of this species are infected or not and whether they constitute a risk factor for transmission to cattle."

What is ruled out after the thorough investigation carried out in Asturias, is that the roe deer (_Capreolus capreolus_) is a reservoir for bovine TB. "It is ruled out as a reservoir in Asturias and the rest of Spain. The probability of infection and maintenance of the pathogen in this deer is more complicated, as it is not gregarious species," added Balseiro.

[Human and livestock diseases can be difficult to control where infection persists in wildlife populations. Bovine tuberculosis due to _Mycobacterium bovis_ has one of the widest host ranges of all the _M. tuberculosis_ complex (MTC) and can readily spill over into a variety of domestic and wild mammals, including humans. This makes control by culling very frustrating and inefficient. This case increases the list of potential hosts for _M. bovis_.

European badgers (_Meles meles_) have been found to be an alternative host for _M. bovis_ in the British Isles, where it plays an important role in the pathogen's maintenance. Culling efforts by the British government in a series of attempts to limit the spread of _M. bovis_ to cattle have failed and even worsen the situation. The data available up to date strongly suggest that badger culling is only likely to be beneficial if conducted systematically over large areas, and sustained over several years. - Mod.PMB
