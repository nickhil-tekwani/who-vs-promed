Health officials in Northern California issued a warning on Tuesday [10 Sep 2019] after a tainted skin cream imported from Mexico left a Sacramento woman in a semi-comatose state.

The Pond's-labeled skin cream was found to have been contaminated with methylmercury, a hazardous substance causing severe illness and is "extremely dangerous to adults and children," according to a news release on Sacramento County's website.

The woman obtained the cream -- which is used to lighten skin and get rid of spots and wrinkles -- through an informal network importing the product from Mexico, the release stated.

Health officials emphasized the mercury was not added by the manufacturer, but by another party after it was purchased.

The woman's illness marks the 1st reported case of mercury poisoning tied to skin cream in the USA, according to the county.

"Sacramento County Public Health urges the community to immediately stop using similar skin creams imported from Mexico due to the risk of contamination with methylmercury," said Dr. Olivia Kasirye, the county's public health officer.

The California Department of Public Health is working closely with the county to test similar creams in the area for methylmercury.

In the meantime, anyone who uses a skin cream from Mexico is urged to stop using it immediately. Instead, consumers should put the product in a closed Ziploc bag, bring it to their doctor, and have a blood and urine test, according to the county.

Symptoms of methylmercury poisoning include headaches, fatigue, weight loss, and numbness or tingling in the hands, feet or around the lips.

Over the past 9 years, there have been over 60 poisonings in the state linked to unlabeled, homemade or foreign brand skin creams that contained calomel or mercurous chloride, a less toxic form of mercury, according to the release.

[Mercury in skin creams (from the above stated website https://dhs.saccounty.net/PUB/Pages/Mercury-in-Skin-Creams.aspx): In California, over the last 9 years, there have been over 60 poisonings linked to foreign brand, unlabeled, and/or homemade skin creams that contained the less toxic form of mercury, mercurous chloride or calomel. You should avoid handmade or unlabeled creams and other brand-name containers that are not sealed when purchased. Unsealed containers could have been tampered with and may contain mercury. People use these types of creams for fading freckles, blemishes, and age spots; treating acne; and lightening the skin. These creams are usually sold in small stores, swap meets, by individuals, or on the internet.

In earlier poisonings linked with imported skin cream, several children and babies who were not cream users became very sick from contact with mercury contamination in their homes or through contact with family members who used the products. Children and pregnant women are especially sensitive to the toxic effects of mercury. Some of these products contain more than 200 000 times the legal limit of mercury.

General signs and symptoms:
- Difficulty concentrating, memory loss
- Nervousness, irritability, anxiety
- Depression, insomnia
- Headaches
- Weight loss, fatigue
- Tremors, numbness or tingling in hands, feet, or around the lips

Children with prolonged exposure:
- Pink hands and feet
- Skin flaking
- Excessive saliva or [thirst], gum disease
- Irritability, poor appetite
- Poor muscle tone, leg cramps
- High blood pressure, rash

From the World Health Organization (https://www.who.int/ipcs/assessment/public_health/mercury_flyer.pdf): Mercury is a common ingredient found in skin-lightening soaps and creams. It is also found in other cosmetics, such as eye makeup cleansing products and mascara. Skin-lightening soaps and creams are commonly used in certain African and Asian nations. They are also used among dark-skinned populations in Europe and North America. Mercury salts inhibit the formation of melanin, resulting in a lighter skin tone. Mercury in cosmetics exists in 2 forms: inorganic and organic. Inorganic mercury (e.g., ammoniated mercury) is used in skin-lightening soaps and creams. Organic mercury compounds (thiomersal [ethyl mercury] and phenyl mercuric salts) are used as cosmetic preservatives in eye makeup cleansing products and mascara.

The soaps come in bar form and are sold individually in boxes. The creams are generally packaged in tubes or jars. The soaps contain approximately 1-3% mercury iodide, and the creams are composed of 1%-10% mercury ammonium. Some soap products tested contained mercury at concentrations up to 31 mg/kg, whereas cream products had mercury concentrations as high as 33 000 mg/kg.

Products with very high levels of mercury contamination look grey or cream coloured.

The amount or concentration of mercury in a product may be labelled on the packaging or in the ingredient list. Names to look for include mercury, Hg, mercuric iodide, mercurous chloride, ammoniated mercury, amide chloride of mercury, quicksilver, cinnabaris (mercury sulfide), hydrargyri oxydum rubrum (mercury oxide), mercury iodide or "poison"; directions to avoid contact with silver, gold, rubber, aluminium and jewellery may also indicate the presence of mercury. However, companies selling products that contain mercury do not always list it as an ingredient.

Health effects and how to measure exposure: The main adverse effect of the inorganic mercury contained in skin-lightening soaps and creams is kidney damage. Mercury in skin-lightening products may also cause skin rashes, skin discoloration and scarring, as well as a reduction in the skin's resistance to bacterial and fungal infections. Other effects include anxiety, depression or psychosis and peripheral neuropathy.

The medical literature reports specific instances of individuals suffering from the aforementioned health effects following exposure to mercury through skin-lightening creams and soaps. One case report describes a 34-year-old Chinese woman who developed nephrotic syndrome, a condition marked by high levels of protein in the urine. The mercury levels in her blood and urine returned to normal 1 month and 9 months, respectively, after she stopped using the skin-lightening cream.

One study indicated a large proportion of nephrotic syndrome among African women using ammoniated mercuric chloride-containing skin lightening creams for periods ranging from 1 month to 3 years. Over three-quarters of the women who stopped using the creams went into remission.

Mercury in soaps, creams and other cosmetic products is eventually discharged into wastewater. The mercury then enters the environment, where it becomes methylated and enters the food-chain as the highly toxic methylmercury in fish. Pregnant women who consume fish containing methylmercury transfer the mercury to their fetuses, which can later result in neurodevelopmental deficits in the children.

Exposure to inorganic mercury can be quantified through measurements in blood and urine (extracted from https://www.who.int/ipcs/assessment/public_health/mercury_flyer.pdf).

While most women are very conscious of signs of aging, this is clearly a case of a need to exercise caution and read labels. However, unscrupulous 3rd parties contaminating a product post-market is always dangerous and can be difficult for the average consumer to detect.

According to a trusted colleague: Recalls for these products occur every so often when they make their way into the USA...there have been several in the last 10 years, which the US FDA refers to here: < https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/mercury-poisoning-linked-skin-products>. - Mod.TG
