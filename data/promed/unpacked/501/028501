Outbreak of bird flu in Trinidad and Tobago
----------------------------------------------
Agriculture Minister Jarrette Narine was cited as saying that more than 18
000 chickens are to be destroyed Wednesday following an outbreak of a type
of bird flu at a central Trinidad and Tobago farm.
Narine said the Noonoo Farm in the Cunupia district of this Caribbean
island had been quarantined, and police were deployed to the scene to
prevent the distribution of infected birds. He said the local poultry
industry should not be affected. Tests had been carried out at the farm
after birds started dying.
The Trinidad virus, Narine declared, was different from the bird flu that
has devastated poultry farms across Southeast Asia.
