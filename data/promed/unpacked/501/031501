[ProMED-mail wishes to thank the EpiCore Global Surveillance Project member for the said information.

Nepal submitted, on 22 Aug 2017, an immediate OIE notification on an FMD outbreak of serotype A, lineage G-VII. The event, reportedly, had started on 2 Apr 2017 in the southern province Chitwan, affecting unvaccinated cattle and buffaloes on 4 farms in Bharatpur, and was confirmed 4 days later, on 6 Apr 2017. There were no deaths reported (see map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=5338677,33077).

Epidemiological comments indicated that there was a buffalo collection and selling center 100 meters close to the village and that buffaloes had been "collected from different neighboring districts and international bordering districts." Samples collected from cattle on 6 Apr 2017 were received at the WRLFMD (Pirbright, UK) on 7 Aug 2017 and genotyped there as s FMDV -A, topotype Asia, lineage G-VII.

Bhutan submitted on 16 Sep 2017 an immediate OIE notification on an FMD outbreak of serotype A, lineage G-VII, The event, reportedly, had started on 31 Mar 2017 in Bhutan's Quarantine Station at Samdrup Jongkhar. The disease affected 21 milk cattle and 21 calves, which were, reportedly, "imported into the country for breeding." The report further specified that 11 of the 42 cattle died and that "the animals were given a supportive antibiotic treatment and released after fulfillment of the quarantine period and when they had clinically recovered from the infection as per national regulations." A sample collected from affected cattle in Samdrup Jongkhar on 1 Apr 2017 was received at the WRLFMD (Pirbright, UK) on 23 Aug 2017 and genotyped there as s FMDV-A, topotype Asia, lineage G-VII.

The mentioned samples from both affected locations, in Nepal and Bhutan, were found at Pirbright to include the same virus strain (100 percent identity; see http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2017/WRLFMD-2017-00019-Bhutan-A-approved.pdf).

Though the distance between the 2 locations in Nepal and in Bhutan is almost 700 km, a common source deserves to be considered or is rather likely, probably in West Bengal as might be expected from the above received EpiCore response to ProMED-mail's RFI. Final results of the epidemiological investigation may furnish the complementary scenario. - Mod.AS
