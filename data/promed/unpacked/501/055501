[1] Michigan: unpasteurized milk

Health officials say 3 Michigan women who reported consuming raw milk
have been diagnosed with a rare bacterial infection called Q fever.

The Michigan Department of Community Health says that the raw milk
was from a Livingston County farm, where people own shares of cows in
exchange for unpasteurized milk products. The department says 2 Q
fever cases were in Washtenaw County and one was in Monroe County.

People can become ill with the bacteria if they inhale barnyard dust
particles contaminated by infected animals or consume raw milk. They
suffer flu like symptoms, including high fever, headaches, malaise,
abdominal pain, chills, vomiting, and diarrhea. Left untreated,
serious cases of Q fever can lead to chronic illness that may affect a
person's heart, liver, brain, and lungs and may be fatal.

[A detailed discussion on the transmission of _Coxiella burnetii_ is
posted below.

After an incubation period of several weeks, the infection (which can
be asymptomatic) generally presented with fever, a dry cough, and
joint pains. Not uncommonly, the patient, diagnosed as having
pneumonia, is also found to have notable abnormalities in liver
function. It is that combination that should make the astute clinician
concerned about the diagnosis especially in the setting of exposure to
livestock or living near farms where the livestock are raised. It is
not stated what symptoms were manifest in these cases or if the
exposure to raw milk was ascertained before or after the diagnosis of
Q fever was made.

Classical zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_, _Brucella
melitensis_, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ species, _Listeria
monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ species, _Yersinia_ species, _Coxiella
burnetii_, and _E. coli_ O157:H7 are associated with raw milk
ingestion.

Non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_
Typhi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ species, _Salmonella_
Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from
_Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A virus have also been
associated with raw milk ingestion.

Other diseases that can be related to unpasteurized milk are
highlighted in these paragraphs extracted from Leedom JM: Milk and
infectious diseases in humans. Clin Infect Dis 2006; 43(5): 610-5
(http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/507035) with the
citations renumbered to be consecutive starting from 1:

In 1996 and 1998, there were 2 episodes involving rabid cows that
occurred in Massachusetts (1). Milk from rabid cows can contain rabies
virus, and transmission via unpasteurized milk is theoretically
possible. Temperatures reached during pasteurization kill the virus.
80 persons consumed unpasteurized milk that was collected from the 2
cows, and 9 more had contact with saliva from the cows. All 89 persons
received postexposure rabies prophylaxis, and no human cases of rabies
eventuated. A similar report in Oklahoma of possible rabies exposure
associated with the consumption of raw milk or cream from a rabid cow
was circulated in 2006 (2).

Tickborne encephalitis, a zoonotic arbovirus infection usually
transmitted to humans by the bite of an _Ixodes persulcatus_ or
_Ixodes ricinus_ tick, is endemic to Central Europe, Eastern Europe,
and Russia (3). However, the virus can be found in the milk of cows
and goats with tickborne encephalitis and was reported to be
transmissible to humans by the consumption of unpasteurized milk (4).
A case-control study failed to confirm oral transmission (5).

A diarrhea syndrome (later named Brainerd diarrhea) occurred among
122 residents of Brainerd, Minnesota, during the period December
1983-July 1984 (6). It was characterized by acute onset, marked
urgency, lack of systemic symptoms, failure to respond to conventional
antimicrobial agents, and a long median duration of illness (median
duration, 16.5 months). The syndrome was linked to consumption of raw
milk from a single dairy (6). No etiologic agent was ever isolated.
The outbreak of Brainerd diarrhea stopped when all of the dairy's
output was diverted and pasteurized (6, MT Osterholm, personal
communication).

Subsequent outbreaks in Illinois and Texas were not directly
associated with milk, although cattle had been in the vicinity of an
Illinois well that had its water implicated as a vehicle of
transmission (7). Another outbreak of Brainerd-like diarrhea, although
not associated with raw milk, affected 58 (15 per cent) of 394
passengers aboard a cruise ship visiting the Galapagos Islands in
Ecuador (8).

Health officials in Washington say 5 people have been diagnosed with
what doctors suspect is a rare livestock-related bacterial infection
called Q fever.

Federal, state, and local health and agricultural officials say they
have traced the infection to goats purchased from or bred at farms in
Washington state's Grant County, The Spokesman Review of Spokane
reported.

Goats from the farms have been traced to 9 other Washington counties
and to Cascade and Teton counties in Montana, where 6 more people have
been stricken with suspected Q fever, the newspaper said.

Such bacterial infections are common among goat, sheep, and cattle
herds, Jason Kelly, a spokesman for the Washington state Department of
Agriculture, said, citing a national study that found that at times 90
percent of dairy herds can carry the organism.

Human cases of Q fever are rare, however, with only between 0-3 cases
of Q fever normally confirmed in Washington each year, Donn Moyer, a
spokesman for the state Department of Health, said.

[Q fever was first described in Australia. It was called "Query
fever" because the causative agent was initially unknown. _Coxiella
burnetii_, the causative agent, was discovered in 1937. This organism
is an agent that can be resistant to heat and desiccation and highly
infectious by the aerosol route. A single inhaled organism may produce
clinical illness. Indeed, in [non-human] primates, the dose to kill 50
per cent of the primates was found to be 1.7 organisms (1).

Cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_.
Infection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals, including
other species of livestock and domesticated pets. _C. burnetii_ does
not usually cause clinical disease in these animals, although abortion
in goats and sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_ infection.
Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals.
Most importantly, during birthing the organisms are shed in high
numbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta. Contact with
contaminated wool is known to be a mode of transmission (2).

The organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common
disinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long
periods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is
associated with compact small-cell variants of the organism that are
produced during standard replication (along with the less resistant
large-cell form) and are metabolically dormant and spore-like (3).

The Q fever organism is a category B bioterrorism agent and, in fact,
although not thought to be related to bioterrorism, was spread by mail
in a post office in the UK in 1987 (4).

Infection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms
from air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried
placental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd
animals. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very
few organisms may be required to cause infection.

Ingestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and
inspiration of the contaminated food, is a less common mode of
transmission. Instances of other modes of transmission to humans,
including tick bites and human to human transmission, are rare.

An earlier outbreak of infection in 51 people in Scotland, UK, was
tied to a meat processing plant and appeared to spread via aerosol for
at least 0.5 mi (0.8 km).
