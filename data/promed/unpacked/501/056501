TICK-BORNE ENCEPHALITIS - AUSTRIA

With reference to the ProMED-mail posts reporting increased
tick-borne encephalitis in Russia (referenced below), I would like to
report that in Austria this year [2011], there have already been 37
cases of confirmed tick-borne encephalitis (as compared to 20 in the
same interval in 2010). Whether this is due to climate changes, a
change in tick activity or a decline in vaccination
acceptance/adherence to vaccination recommendations (in Austria some
88 percent of the population received (partial) vaccination) is not
clear.

In Austria, transmission has been proven more or less all over the
country in regions up to 1560 meters, so vaccination should also be
recommended to people with leisure time activities like jogging,
hiking, biking, trekking or mountaineering. Two excellent vaccines are
available here all year round: FSME immun and Encepur.

[ProMED-mail thanks Martin Haditsch for provision of this
information. Visitors to many northern European countries and large
parts of Central and Eastern Asia where tick-borne encephalitis (TBE)
is endemic should be made aware of the need to avoid bites by ticks
or, in the case of prolonged residence, the advisability of seeking
vaccination.

Heinz et al. [Field effectiveness of vaccination against tick-borne
encephalitis. Vaccine. 2007 Oct 23;25(43):7559-67] investigated the
field effectiveness of TBE vaccination in Austria for the years
2000-2006 in different age groups on the basis of the documented
numbers of hospitalized cases in unvaccinated and vaccinated people
and the sizes of these population groups as revealed by representative
inquiries. They showed that the overall effectiveness in regularly
vaccinated persons was about 99 percent with no statistically
significant difference between age groups. It was at least as high
after the 1st 2 vaccinations, i.e. before the completion of the basic
vaccination scheme by a 3rd vaccination, but was significantly lower
(about 95 percent) in those with a record of irregular vaccination.
Their data confirm the excellent performance of TBE vaccine under
field conditions and provided evidence that, in Austria, about 2800
cases were prevented by vaccination in the years 2000-2006.
