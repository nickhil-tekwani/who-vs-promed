A total of 10 new H7N9 influenza cases, along with 3 deaths, were reported from 5 China provinces today [4 Feb 2014], vaulting the outbreak case total over the 300 mark after less than a year of disease activity. All of the new lab-confirmed cases involve adults, except for one, a 4 year old girl from Guangdong province; and 7 of the 10 patients are men.

The 2nd wave of cases, which began in October [2013] but rapidly increased last month [January 2014], reached 165 with the new reports, compared with last spring's [2013] total of 136. The infections boost the 2013-14 outbreak total to 301 cases, according to a running tally compiled by the FluTrackers infectious disease news message board [see: http://www.flutrackers.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=2959]. That total in less than a year appears to be unprecedented for human cases of avian flu. By comparison, the most active calendar year for the H5N1 strain, in 2006, saw 115 cases, according to data from the World Health Organization (WHO). The 3 newly reported deaths lift the unofficial fatality count to 67.

A total of 8 of today's [4 Feb 2014] cases were reported from Zhejiang and Guangdong provinces, and the brisk pace of cases from those more southern provinces is driving most of the H7N9 activity in the 2nd wave of infections. Of the 165 cases reported in the 2nd wave, 125 have been reported from those 2 provinces: 73 from Zhejiang and 52 from Guangdong.

For comparison, during the 1st wave, the main hot spots were north of there, with Zhejiang (46), Shanghai (34), and Jiangsu (28) reporting 108 of 136 illnesses. Only one case was detected in Guangdong province during the 1st wave. According to provincial health ministry statements today [4 Feb 2014] translated and posted by the FluTrackers infectious disease news message board, Zhejiang province has 4 new infections, all in men, ages 42, 51, 56, and 84; 2 are severely ill in hospital, and 2 are listed as in a critical condition. Guangdong province reported 3 case-patients, a 4 year old girl who is in a stable condition, and 2 men, ages 52 and 76, both of whom died from their infections. Guangxi province reported its 2nd case so far in the outbreak, in a 41 year old woman who is in a critical condition. Cases from that province are notable, because they edge the reach of known cases south and west of the main outbreak area, in an area that borders northern Vietnam.

Elsewhere, Jiangsu province reported one new case, in a 59 year old woman who is in a critical condition, as well as the H7N9 death of a previously confirmed case, believed to be a 76 year old man whose illness was 1st reported in January [2014].

The 10th case reported today [4 Feb 2014] is from Fujian province, in a 36 year old man who is in a critical condition.
