Thousands of Birds Drop Dead Over Australia, Cause Unknown
-----------------------------------------------
Thousands of birds have fallen from the skies over Esperance,
Australia, and no one knows why. Is it an illness, toxins or a
natural phenomenon? A string of necropies in Perth have shed no light
on the mystery. All the residents of flood-devastated Esperance know
is that their "dawn chorus" of singing birds is missing.
The main casualties are wattle birds, yellow-throated miners, New
Holland honeyeaters and singing honeyeaters, although some dead
crows, hawks and pigeons have also been found. Wildlife officers are
baffled by the "catastrophic" event, which the Department of
Environment and Conservation (DEC) said began well before last week's
freak storm.
On Monday [8 Jan 2007], Esperance, 450 miles southeast of Perth, was
declared a natural disaster zone. District nature conservation
coordinator Mike Fitzgerald said the 1st reports of birds dropping
dead in people's yards came in 3 weeks ago. More than 500 deaths had
since been notified. But the calls stopped suddenly last week,
reportedly because no birds were left. "It's very substantial. We
estimate several thousand birds are dead, although we don't have a
clear number because of the large areas of bushland," Fitzgerald said.
Birds Australia, the nation's main bird conservation group, said it
had not heard of a similar occurrence. "Not on that scale, and all at
the same time, and also the fact that it's several different
species," chief executive Graeme Hamilton said. "You'd have to call
that a most unusual event and one that we'd all have to be concerned
about." He expected birds would return to the area once the problem
-- natural or man-made phenomenon -- was fixed but said it was vital
the cause was identified. The Department of Agriculture and Food,
which conducted the necropsies, has almost ruled out an infectious process.
Acting chief veterinary officer Fiona Sunderman said toxins were the
most likely cause but that the deaths could be due to anything from
toxic algae to chemicals and pesticides. Sunderman said there were no
leads yet on which of the potentially hundreds of toxins might be
responsible. Some birds were seen convulsing as they died. Michelle
Crisp was one of the 1st to contact the DEC after finding dozens of
dead birds on her property one morning. She told The Australian she
normally had hundreds of birds in her yard but that she and a
neighbor counted 80 dead birds in one day. "It went to the point
where we had nothing, not a bird," she said. "It was like a
moonscape, just horrible. But the frightening thing for us, we didn't
find any more birds after that. We literally didn't have any birds
left to die."

[It would be helpful to know what the necropsy results are, what
toxicology tests have been run, and whether a screening for
insecticides, organophosphates and/or avicides has been done.
Although they claim to rule out infectious disease, one wonders what
tests have been done.
The article here does not give us enough information to speculate but
does mention that this die-off has been occurring for approximately 3
weeks. Therefore, it is likely that we can rule out storms, as
pointed out in the article. With so many species involved over a
large area, it is possible to rule out avicides, or certainly put
them farther down on a differential diagnosis list. But otherwise, we
are no closer to understanding the cause.
If there is any more information from an authoritative source
available, we would appreciate hearing it.
