Re: Bovine tuberculosis, human - UK: (England) ex Alpaca
-------------------------------------
One wonders whether perhaps the camelids might have some relatively generalized reduced efficiency in cell mediated immunity [CMI]? They seem to be uncommonly susceptible to acquiring and then succumbing relatively rapidly to several infections in which CMI plays a relatively large part in the usual mammalian bodily immune defense systems: _M. tuberculosis complex_, paratuberculosis (Johne's disease), melioidosis, some relatively common corynebacterial infections, many internal parasites, etc.

[I do not know whether it is relevant, but when vaccinating alpacas and such with Sterne vaccine, one must use a half dose. Otherwise you kill them.

Maybe their minimum infective dose is much lower for some reason related to this higher susceptibility. - Mod.MHJ]

[Available additional information on the interesting issue raised by Dr Thomson will be welcomed. - Mod.AS
