A 58-year-old man has been confirmed as the latest person to die of rabies in Sarawak this year [2020], said Health Director-General Tan Sri Dr. Noor Hisham Abdullah today [3 Dec 2020]. He also said another rabies case involving a 3-year-old boy was still receiving treatment for the disease and was reported to be in stable condition.

"With these 2 latest cases, the total number of rabies cases involving humans in Malaysia for the year 2020 has increased to 8 cases. The total accumulative number of rabies cases in Sarawak since the rabies outbreak was declared in the state on 1 Jul 2017, now stands at 30 cases with 28 fatalities.

"Only 2 cases are still alive, and both are children who received early treatment," he said in a statement today [see comment].

On the latest fatality, Dr. Noor Hisham said the deceased was admitted to the ward at Lundu Hospital on 19 Nov 2020 for 3 days following symptoms of body pain and weakness. He said the victim had also complained of a sore throat with difficulty in eating and drinking, before being transferred to Sarawak General Hospital (SGH) on 21 Nov 2020 when his health condition worsened.

"He passed away on 25 Nov 2020 and was diagnosed with rabies meningoencephalitis. The diagnosis was confirmed by a rabies positive laboratory test by Institute of Medical Research (IMR) the same day. The deceased had a history of being bitten by a stray dog 2 years ago while hunting in the jungle, but he did not seek immediate treatment at any health facility. The case also took care of 5 dogs, but these dogs have been confirmed negative for rabies by the Sarawak Veterinary Department," said Dr. Noor Hisham.

The death is the 7th fatality from rabies in Sarawak this year [2020]. The previous case involved a 16-year-old girl who died at the SGH on 11 Nov 2020 and was confirmed to be infected with the rabies virus the next day.

On the other case involving a 3-year-old boy who is still alive, Dr. Noor Hisham said the case was bitten by a dog on the face on 2 Nov 2020 before being immediately admitted to Bau Hospital to receive rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) injection and an anti-rabies vaccine.

"The case was discharged in good health on 6 Nov 2020. However, [from 13 to 15 Nov 2020], this child suffered high fever, weak limbs, poor appetite, restlessness, hydrophobia and showed aggressive behaviour. The case was admitted to SGH on 16 Nov 2020 for further treatment and confirmed to be infected with the rabies virus through laboratory tests conducted by the IMR on 25 Nov 2020. The child is now receiving treatment at the SGH and in stable condition. We at the Ministry of Health (MoH) pray for his speedy recovery," said Dr. Noor Hisham.

According to him again, it was found that the child was bitten by a pet dog belonging to a neighbour while trying to save his grandmother's cat, which was attacked by the dog. "This dog was caught by the Bau District Council on 3 Nov 2020 and confirmed positive for rabies virus on 18 Nov 2020," he said.

Dr. Noor Hisham said deaths from rabies can be avoided if preventive measures are taken such as immediately seeking treatment at a nearby health clinic or hospital if bitten by animal. Those who are bitten by a dog or other animal must wash the bitten body parts with running water and soap for at least 15 minutes to remove the saliva, he said again.

"Make sure your pet dogs have received anti-rabies vaccination every year from the nearest animal clinic and avoid having your pets mixing together with other dogs or wild animals. If a pet dog or cat is found to have a sudden change in behaviour, including becoming more aggressive, seek immediate treatment at a veterinary clinic and report to the nearest Veterinary Services Department. Also make a report to the local authority if there are stray dogs roaming in your area of residence," he added.

He also said MoH and Sarawak Health Department (JKN Sarawak) will continue to monitor the rabies situation in Sarawak. He added they will share the latest related information to the Sarawak Department of Veterinary Services (DVS Sarawak) and DVS Malaysia to ensure that rabies prevention and control measures are implemented promptly and comprehensively.

"The cooperation of all Sarawakians is very much needed, by fully complying with all the advice from the government and the authorities to ensure that the problem of rabies in the state can be controlled. Do not let pets roam or dispose of them in public areas," he said.

[The 58-year-old man who died on 25 Nov 2020 had been initially admitted to a local hospital on 19 Nov 2020 and transferred, when his health condition worsened, on 21 Nov 2020 to the Sarawak General Hospital. The attribution of his rabies infection to a bite "by a stray dog in the jungle" (of which no further clinical information or fate is available) 2 years earlier, an extremely long period for rabies incubation, deserves to be viewed cautiously. His potential exposure to a rabid animal on rather a later date, most likely within the last 6 months, seems to have been considered by the authorities; hence, the information that "the case also took care of 5 dogs, but these dogs have been confirmed negative for rabies by the Sarawak Veterinary Department." This does not exclude the (plausible) possibility that a hitherto unrecognised animal was the true vector that infected the victim during the 6 months before the development of clinical signs. Having said this, it should be admitted that some, though rare, confirmed rabies cases in humans with very long incubation periods are found in the literature.

The history of the 2nd case, in a 3-year-old boy who apparently received his initial post-exposure treatment (RIG AND vaccine) immediately after exposure (which took place 2 Nov 2020), discharged "in good health" on 6 Nov 2020 but had to be re-admitted for renewed treatment on 16 Nov 2020, deserves further investigation that should include visiting the protocol of the initial treatment and the medicaments used.

[2] Bhutan: dog-transmitted fatal rabies case in an untreated young girl
Date: Wed 18 Nov 2020
Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]
http://outbreaknewstoday.com/bhutan-human-rabies-death-reported-in-samtse-district-56608/


According to a report in the Bhutanese news source, Kuensel, a 3-year-old girl from Lamjumsa village of Norbugang (Chengmari) gewog in Samtse died of rabies infection on 11 Nov 2020. The child died 2 months after a stray dog had bitten her. It is reported that although the parents were aware of the rabies risk, they did not take the child to the hospital after the exposure.

Rabies is an acute viral infection that is transmitted to humans or other mammals usually through the saliva from a bite of an infected animal. It is also rarely contracted through breaks in the skin or contact with mucous membranes.

According to the Control of Communicable Diseases Manual, all mammals are susceptible to rabies. Raccoons, skunks, foxes, bats, dogs, coyotes and cats are the likely suspects.

Initially, like in many diseases, rabies symptoms in humans are non-specific: fever, headache and malaise. This may last several days. At the site of the bite there may be some pain and discomfort. Symptoms then progress to more severe: confusion, delirium, abnormal behavior and hallucinations. If it gets this far, the disease is nearly 100% fatal.

What should do if you are exposed? First, clean the wound well with soap and water for 5-10 minutes. This will help reduce the chance of getting other bacterial infections, and some studies show it can reduce the likelihood of getting rabies. Next, get good description of the animal for Animal Control so it can be picked up for quarantine or rabies testing.

Go see your family physician or the emergency room. Though technically not a medical emergency, it is important to seek medical attention quickly so proper, timely treatment is given. If you have to shoot or otherwise kill the animal, take care not to damage the head. The brain will be required for rabies testing.

Your doctor will evaluate the type of exposure (bite, scratch), and the type of animal that you had contact with. If post-exposure treatment is required, it will likely be a combination of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and rabies vaccine. The HRIG is given in one dose. RIG is basically pre-formed antibody that will provide immediate protection until you respond to the vaccine. The vaccine will help your body produce antibody to the virus, but this takes some time.

According to the CDC, the HRIG should, if possible, be given around the wound itself. Any remaining HRIG should be given intramuscularly away from the bite. Rabies vaccine is not like the old days, 20 shots in the stomach; instead, it is 4 shots in the shoulder area.
