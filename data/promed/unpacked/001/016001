A spokesman with the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture said here on
Friday [1 Jul 2005] that the bird flu outbreak in Qinghai Province in
northwestern China has been "brought under control."

Jia Youling, the spokesman and also director general of the
ministry's Veterinary Bureau, said the number of migrant birds killed
by the disease has dropped to about 20 a day since 8 Jun 2005.

Thus far, more than 6000 migratory birds have died since the disease
was reported on 4 May 2005.

Jia said the ministry has reported the latest developments to
relevant international organizations.

The governments at all levels in China attach great importance to the
prevention and control of bird flu, and related departments have
taken many measures to prevent the disease. Since the bird flu
outbreak was reported in Qinghai, the local government has done a lot
to prevent the epidemic from spreading, he said, adding that no fowl
or human beings have been infected so far.

Jia said the Agriculture Ministry is studying and testing the virus
drawn from the birds killed by the fatal disease in Qinghai, and the
result will be reported to concerned international organizations as
soon as possible.

China has provided 5 viral strains to the World Health Organization
(WHO) since bird flu cases were reported in the country in 2004.

The Agriculture Ministry hopes for closer cooperation with
international organizations and welcomes international experts to
Chinese labs for study, Jia said.

The WHO has asked China to test some of the birds in the area to
determine if any species were infected with the virus.

Each summer, some 189 species of birds flock to Qinghai Lake, a
mating ground for migratory birds, before heading south and west.
Qinghai Lake has become a popular tourist attraction. In late May,
more than 1000 wild birds, including geese and gulls, were killed by
the H5N1 flu strain in Qinghai.

[Rather than having been "brought under control", this mass mortality
in wild waterfowl, allegedly caused by avian influenza H5N1, seems to
run its natural course after peaking. Information about the
characteristics of the isolated virus strain(s) will be appreciated.
