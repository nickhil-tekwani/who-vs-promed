The fungus _Leptosphaeria maculans_ (anamorph _Phoma lingam_) causes
blackleg in canola (_Brassica napus_). Infection of all above-ground parts
of the plant has been described, but we have found no reports of [root
infection, ... [nor did West et al. (1999).
Canola plants at the flowering and pod-filling stages, with foliar symptoms
of blackleg, were collected from commercial crops in South Australia,
Victoria and New South Wales, Australia in November and December 2000. Some
plants had lodged and had the basal cankers commonly described for
blackleg, however, many plants had died prematurely during late pod fill.
Cankers and other external symptoms were not present on the lower stems of
these plants and many could be pulled easily from the ground.
The lateral roots had blackened areas ... taproots ... had extensive
internal tissue necrosis ... In some plants, the pith of the stem was also
necrotic, although there were no external symptoms ... In another case, a
distinct black band was seen around the circumference of the taproot below
the crown.
Samples of discoloured tissue were surface sterilised and cultured on
quarter-strength [PDA. _P. lingam_ was isolated from all samples,
identified as described by Punithalingham & Holliday (1972). All isolates
were virulent (A-group) according to PCR-based tests carried out by the
Root Disease Testing Service, South Australian Research and Development
Institute (Sosnowski et al., 2001). _Phytophthora_ and _Rhizoctonia_ spp.
were not isolated from the discoloured tissues.
Pycnidiospore suspensions (106 spores/ml) were prepared from [2 isolates
of _P. lingam_ (66/97 and 208/00) obtained from leaves and roots,
respectively, of diseased plants. These suspensions were used to inoculate
(i) lateral roots severed with surface sterilised scissors and (ii)
hypocotyls wounded with sterile toothpicks on otherwise healthy canola
seedlings in the glasshouse. [3 weeks after inoculation, stem and crown
cankers appeared on plants inoculated with either isolate on either roots
or hypocotyls and root tissue was necrotic ... whereas control plants,
wounded as described above and inoculated with sterile water, remained
healthy. _P. lingam_ was the only pathogen isolated from diseased root
tissue. This confirms the occurrence of the blackleg fungus in the roots of
canola plants and reveals its ability to infect through wounds in the roots.
This is the first record of symptoms of blackleg on canola roots in
Australia. However, there is anecdotal evidence that such symptoms have
occurred in the past (D. Ballinger, Dovuro Pty Ltd, Horsham, Victoria,
Australia, personal communication; M. Barbetti, Agriculture Western
Australia, South Perth, Western Australia, Australia, personal communication).
Initially we assumed that the infection had spread from the crown into the
roots, but now have evidence that the disease can also be soil-borne. This
may have important ramifications for our understanding of the blackleg
disease cycle. This aspect will be investigated further in the current
project entitled 'Investigating resistance and management of blackleg in
canola', which is funded by the Australian Research Council, the South
Australian Grains Industry Trust Fund, and the South Australian Research
and Development Institute.

[Blackleg disease occurs in all countries where canola is grown
extensively, and can cause serious crop losses. The pathogen survives on
residues from infected crops, where it produces the next stage of spores to
perpetuate the disease. Infection of canola roots via roots presents an
unexpected route of infection that will likely cause increased crop loss in
plants expressing foliar and root symptoms.
It would be very interesting to know if canola pathologists in other
countries have observed root infection by _Leptosphaeria maculans_. Let me
know, please! - Mod.DH
