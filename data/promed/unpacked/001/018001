While most people have been concerned about the spread of coronavirus, there's another infection dog owners need to be wary of. Vets are warning people to make sure their canines are vaccinated after a spike in parvovirus cases in southeast Queensland and northern New South Wales (NSW).

The Animal Emergency Service has already seen 40 cases so far this year [2020]. Last year [2019], they had 58 cases over the whole 12 months.

Dr. Brooke Schampers said it was one of the worst spikes they had seen, with an "unprecedented" number of families losing pets and vet bills totalling thousands of dollars.

"Parvovirus is an easily preventable disease," she told 9 News. "Check your vaccination schedule or call your local vet if in doubt, and ensure your dog is protected from this horrific strain we are seeing in our hospitals."

Parvovirus is highly contagious and presents with signs of vomiting and diarrhoea. The virus attacks the lining of the intestines and the bone marrow. The damaged bone marrow can no longer produce enough white blood cells needed to fight off infections. Dogs also experience lethargy and loss of appetite.

The heart form of the virus is less common and attacks the heart muscles of very young puppies. Both forms result in a rapid death.

It can be easily transferred on the paws of dogs and on people's shoes or other items contaminated with the virus, like bedding. It is also passed in the faeces of infected animals.

Vets are warning the disease is spreading fast across the Brisbane suburbs of Redbank Plains, Redbank, Springfield, and Forestdale.

"If you suspect your dog has parvovirus, visit your vet immediately -- because if your pet isn't treated quickly, the signs will become fatal," Dr. Schampers told the Courier Mail. "We have seen pets pass away within 2 days of showing signs of this cruel disease. It's not something to be complacent about."

[Parvovirus ("parvo") is a serious canine disease. Clinical signs of the virus in dogs, especially puppies, include severe, bloody diarrhea, lethargy (laying around, no apparent energy, or interest in activities), anorexia (not eating), fever, vomiting, weight loss, weakness, depression, and dehydration.

In the majority of cases, untreated dogs contracting parvovirus will die. Treatment relies on replacing lost body fluids and correcting disturbed electrolyte balance. Both the severity of the challenge and the timing of when treatment is started will affect the outcome. Treatment usually involves intensive care for several days in the veterinary hospital and can be very expensive.

Vaccinating your dog is the best way to prevent canine parvovirus infection.

Parvovirus is a preventable disease. It is prevented with a series of vaccines against the virus. For puppies, the vaccines should begin close to 6 weeks of age and be repeated approximately every 3 weeks until a series of 3 or 4 vaccines has been given. Thereafter, a vaccine should be given annually, as the virus can circulate in populations and your adult dog may be re-exposed through sniffing or licking in public places where other dogs have been or you may track the virus back to your dog on your shoes. Consequently, keeping up with vaccination schedules is critical for the health of your animals. Once the complete puppy series is given, some locations may choose to vaccinate only every 3 years. Please consult with your veterinarian regarding the frequency of adult animal vaccinations in your area.

Most deaths from parvovirus occur within 48 to 72 hours following the onset of clinical signs. If your puppy or dog shows any of these signs, you should contact your veterinarian immediately (https://www.avma.org/public/PetCare/Pages/canine-parvovirus.aspx).

Intestinal parasites, especially in puppies, may also cause diarrhea or bloody diarrhea. Do not take a chance the diarrhea or bloody diarrhea may be from parasites, which can also kill your pet. Take the pet to the veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and medical treatment.

If you adopt or rescue an animal, get the animal vaccinated immediately because you have no way of knowing where the animal has been or what it has been exposed to. While parvovirus is often associated with puppies, adult dogs can succumb to this virus as well. Their immunity can wane if not vaccinated regularly or the animal may come into contact with a large load of the virus while at public locations or even tracked back to them by their pet parents who may have visited a public location or a friend's animal.

Puppies or dogs diagnosed with the virus need treatment. Antiemetics (prevent vomiting) and copious fluids to restore body fluids and electrolytes are important. Keeping the animal hydrated and helping the pet to maintain body temperature is important. Veterinarians may also administer medication to help reduce the fever, especially if it is dangerously high.

Your veterinarian should be your best friend and partner in keeping your pet healthy and in helping to restore a healthy balance when your pet is ill. - Mod.TG
