[Saudi Arabia has been dealing with growing nosocomial/household clusters of MERS for a little over 2 weeks, without major outbreaks, both in Riyadh and in Hofuf. Both cities saw major outbreaks over the summer.

The Riyadh cluster, from which the 1st case emerged on 10 Oct 2015, involves 36 expat housemates living in a crowded 3-room apartment in Eastern Riyadh, some of whom are employees working at Princess Nora University. We've no word on how the virus was originally acquired, but thus far, 9 household members have tested positive (2 are asymptomatic).

Today [27 Oct 2015], we also learn of the 2nd Riyadh HCW infected in less than a week. Whether they acquired the virus from treating patients from the expat cluster mentioned above, or from some other source, isn't clear. There have been several other primary MERS cases admitted to Riyadh hospitals over the past 2 weeks.

Meanwhile, Hofuf reports 2 more MERS cases, both in patients reportedly infected while already hospitalized. This makes 5 nosocomial cases reported out of Hofuf in the span of a week (4 patients, 1 HCW). Two community primary cases were reported the previous week.

The Ministry of Health is studying the possibility of enacting tougher norms to protect patients from contracting infections at health facilities, especially the MERS coronavirus, an official was quoted as saying by local media on Sun [25 Oct 2015].

The Undersecretary for public health and president of the Leadership and Control Center, Dr. Abdulaziz bin Saeed, has revealed that the Ministry of Health has said the penalties would include individuals and health facilities, depending on the type, nature and size of the violation.

"The ministry will not be lenient. The punishment could include closure and financial penalties against hospitals that jeopardize people's health. Hospitals are supposed to protect and treat patients and not infect them with diseases because of negligence," he said.

He said inspection campaigns would continue at all health sectors to monitor any violations that threaten the lives of patients. "These campaigns are related to sterilization and violation of ICU, emergency and operating rooms. Hospitals that abide by the rules and regulations will be commended and appreciated."

The official said the current SR 100 000 [USD 26 663] fine still stands and is related to delay in reporting infectious cases. "Violators could also face jail terms up to 6 months or SR 100 000 fine or both, besides revocation of the license or striking their names from the profession's register."

Some of these punishments have been implemented, but no one has been jailed because of coronavirus, he said, adding that the aim is to ensure quality work at health facilities and curb the spread of coronavirus.

Health authorities have lifted the quarantine on people who came in contact with a patient once thought to be the last South Korean to recover from Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).

The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said on Mon [26 Oct 2015] that 190 people were released from quarantine on Monday as they did not show any MERS symptoms for 14 days after coming into contact the 35-year-old MERS patient.

The patient tested negative for the MERS virus and was released early this month [October 2015], but was admitted to Seoul National University Hospital with a high fever and again diagnosed with the disease on 11 Oct 2015.
