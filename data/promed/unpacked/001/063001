Mr Couger's remarks were very insightful and interesting. I am aware of at
least one study that examined the prevalence of STEC [Shiga toxin producing
Escherichia coli] infection in dairy cattle and antibodies to Shiga toxin
and O157 lipopolysaccharide in dairy farmers and their families (1). There
was a high prevalence of antibodies in the farmers and their families, and
the prevalence of non-O157 STEC infections in the cattle, as expected, was
much higher than that of O157 infections. The implication is that
subclinical infection with less pathogenic STEC may provide protection
against subsequent disease when exposed to more pathogenic strains.

Mr Couger's observations are intriguing. Recurrent _Escherichia coli_ O157
infection has been described, but it is extremely rare. In our experience
with over 330 children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) followed
longitudinally, only a single case of culture confirmed repeat infection
with O157 has been documented. This seems lower than predicted for an
endemic region, but this is weak circumstantial evidence.
There have been a number of recent outbreaks occurring in regions where
many of the exposed may have been from rural areas (the large outbreak at
the Washington County fair in NY state, for example). I wonder if the
investigators looked at living on cattle farms, veterinary exposure, and
other measures of exposure to dairy cattle as potential risk/protective
factors. Evidence of a strong protective effect could prompt attempts to
study the components of the immune response in exposed/protected persons.
Key questions include the role of antibody to shiga toxin, to the products
of the LEE pathogenicity island such as intimin, or the hemolysins, and the
role of cell mediated immune response. Comments from field epidemiologists
with good data would be appreciated.
