The Sao Paulo Municipal Health Secretary is investigating 10 cases suspected of having contracted yellow fever in the city. According to officials, 4 cases were discarded after initial tests. Initially. the Secretariat had said that 14 were under investigations and later stated that 10 continue under investigation.

Of the suspected cases, 2/3 are people who live in the north zone of Sao Paulo, Tremembe region, where the Horto Florestal [Sao Paulo Forest Gardens] and Cantareira State Park, are located.

Monkeys dead of the disease were found in Horto and the park was closed by the health authorities and by the State Secretariat of Health.

According to the Municipal Health Secretary, Wilson Polara, all people suspected of having contracted the virus visited or lived in the north zone. Of the 14 cases that were investigated, 4 now have definitely discarded after 3 phases of tests. The last tests were serological tests, which take up to 15 days to complete. Of these 10 people, just one remains hospitalized.

Physicians are investigating where the people had been to explore the possibility that they contracted in disease in Sao Paulo or in other localities.

This year [2017], 12 cases of the disease have been identified in the city but all were contracted outside of the [state] capital. The Secretary of Health has urged the population to be vaccinated, but says that there is no risk of the disease spreading since the parks were closed 2 weeks ago and yellow fever takes, on average 7 days to propagate.

After the deaths of the monkeys from yellow fever, the state and municipal governments initiated an intensive vaccination campaign. The idea, according to the State Secretary of Health, David Uip, is to vaccinate 1 million people. The focus will be the Tremembe, Casa Verde, and Vila Nova Cachoerinha neighborhoods, which are neighboring Horto [Park].

The vaccination will be focused on these surroundings because the vector mosquitoes do not fly far. "Those who must be vaccinated are the people who live 500 m [550 yds] from Horto [Park]. This is the population on the border," says Regiane de Paula, Director of the Center for Epidemiological Surveillance. According to her, as a precaution, the campaign could be extended to a radius of 1 km [0.5 mi] in the future.

[Information is scarce. When did the symptoms of the 1st and last cases first occur? When were the suspected cases reported? Is there a relationship between the cases? Did all the cases frequent the forested areas? Did they frequent the parks in which confirmed non-human primates were present? Were the discarded [cases] displaced to other localities or municipalities with transmission? For those who, according to the secretary, "lived in the north zone," what is the age group of the patients, what is the severity profile, do they all meet the current case definition criteria? In addition to vaccination, which vector control measures have been (or were) conducted in the dwelling locations (and surroundings) of the suspected cases? Additional information will be welcome.

If one or more cases are confirmed, no surprise, but much worry. - Mod.RNA

The number of cases in this area continues to increase. In October 2017, 13 parks in the area were closed to the public as a preventive measure, the great majority of them since Mon 23 Oct 2017, although authorities stated that there is no yellow fever epidemic. The increased surveillance is essential in order to detect new cases and focus the vaccination campaign. There is no indication that these human cases are due to urban, _Aedes aegypti_ transmission.
