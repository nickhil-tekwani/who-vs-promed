Foot and Mouth Disease - new virus suspected
--------------------------------------------
A 2-member team from the Southern Regional Disease Diagnostic
Laboratory (SRDDL), Bangalore, visited the Foot and Mouth disease
[FMD] affected villages in the district [Kottayam, Kerala] on Friday
[20 Nov 2009].

According to Dr. K.C. James, Joint Director, Animal Husbandry, the 2
senior scientists Dr. Venkitesh and Dr. Giridhar, visited 6 of the
affected villages and collected blood samples, swab and samples from
the affected animals for further analysis. "We suspect strain
variation of the virus affecting the animals in the current outbreak
and are awaiting the results," Dr James said. According to him, the
samples would have to undergo analysis as to which type and sub type
of the virus has caused the disease and it may take up to one month
to get the results [see comment].

With the death of a cow being reported from Kudavachoor, the
situation has taken a serious turn. According to Dr. James, more than
400 cows in the villages of Aymanam, Arpookkara, Chengalam, Vechoor,
Thlayazhom, Manjoor, Kallara, Athirampuzha and Kumarakom on the
western low lying areas of the district, are affected by FMD. This
being a viral disease, the authorities are providing only symptomatic
treatment for the cows. This include antibiotics, fly repellents,
analgesics etc.

What made the situation complex was that the Animal Husbandry
Department had just concluded a vaccination drive which had
successfully vaccinated nearly 85 percent of the animals in the
district. Usually, when an outbreak occurs, the 1st step would be to
provide a protective belt by vaccinating the animals in the nearby
villages and thereby preventing the spread of the disease. Since a
vaccination drive has been taken out recently, another round of
protective vaccination was not under consideration, Dr. James said.

Foot and Mouth disease spreads through the air and the vaccination
has been provided for the normal strains of viruses. However, the
State was facing a complex situation as a large number of animals are
brought in for slaughter from across the State. If any one of the
animals was affected by the disease caused by a new variant of the
virus, the efforts taken so far to prevent the disease through
vaccination becomes ineffective.

The water logged western areas have been prone to FMD earlier also
with similar outbreaks reported in 2003 and 1996, Dr. James said.

[The above newswire was sent from Kottayam, Kerala; see map at
<http://healthmap.org/r/00-Q>.

It may be assumed that the suspicion of a "strain variation of the
virus affecting the animals in the current outbreak" is based upon
cases in animals supposed to have been vaccinated. Information on the
vaccine strains included in the vaccine, by which -- reportedly -- 85
percent of the susceptible animals have been vaccinated, will help.

Kerala was not one of India's states reporting FMD during 2008; the
detailed report is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=report_ann_sem&country=IND&year=2008&semester=0&aquatic=2&WAHID=1>;
see sections 1 and 3. The 2008 report does not include information on
the serotypes involved in the outbreaks nor on routine vaccination performance.

According to the data of the World reference laboratory for FMD,
Pirbright, the serotypes O, A, and Asia 1 are endemic in India. - Mod.AS]
