A total of 20 cases of cholera, including 1 death, have been recorded in the locality of Tembwe, 90 km [56 mi] south east of Kalemie (Katanga). The health area registered nurse, Norbert Tambwe, who provided this information on Sat 20 Dec 2014, said the victims have been identified over 2 months. According to him, the population of Tembwe is exposed to cholera because of its proximity to the waters of Lake Tanganyika. "The village of Tembwe is on the edge of the lake and the entire population, its activities, are at the lake. Above all, the population does not respect hygienic measures, despite the education and the lessons that we give them," said Norbert Tambwe Masudi.

[2] Cholera - Congo DR (Katanga Province)

Between 1 Jan 2014 and 7 Dec 2014, 249 people died of cholera, among the 8700 cases registered in the province of Katanga. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) delivered these figures in its bulletin, published on Wed 17 Dec 2014, in Lubumbashi. Between 1 Jan 2013 and 10 Dec 2013, OCHA had registered in the same province 12 600 cholera cases including 302 deaths.

For OCHA, these many cases of cholera have been notably listed in 2014 in Fungurume, Likasi, Kolwezi, and Lubumbashi. This situation is due to the delay in the delivery of means to support the sick and the difficulty of access to these areas. Of the 68 health areas in the province, notes the humanitarian agency, 34 are affected by cholera.

The Mion District in the Northern Region has been hit by cholera outbreak with 28 cases recorded within the past 2 weeks, Mr Dan Makandan, Mion District chief executive, has announced. He said this during the opening of a branch of Bonzali Rural Bank Limited at Sang on Thu 18 Dec 2014.

Mr Makandan said he had directed the Mion District Health Directorate to put in place measures to control the outbreak of the disease, adding all the 28 affected persons had been treated and discharged. He said "the District Assembly has supported the District Health Directorate with a quantity of drugs to help find a lasting solution to this menace," adding, "We have enough drugs and medicines in our hospital to treat any case."

Mr Makandan called on all, especially the assembly members, and opinion leaders to immediately report any symptoms of the disease to any health facility in the district for treatment.
