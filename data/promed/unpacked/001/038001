As a result of an increase in cases of conjunctivitis, state health
officials issued an alert for extreme hygiene measures.

It has been reported that 17 cases of hemorrhagic conjunctivitis have
been detected in the cities of Manzanillo and Tecoman, and it has
been estimated that about 350 people are at risk of infection. This
year [2010], 3200 cases of classical conjunctivitis have been
reported, so people are urged to wash their hands frequently with
soap and water.

Conjunctivitis is an eye infection common in coastal areas due to the
high temperatures and humidity.

[Conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the thin layer (conjunctiva)
that lines the inside of the eyelid and covers the white part of the
eye. Inflammation can cause blood vessels in the eye to become
larger. And that can make the white of the eye look pink or red.
Thus, conjunctivitis is often called "pink eye" or "red eye."

Conjunctivitis is a common health condition worldwide. The 3 most
common types of conjunctivitis are 1) viral, 2) bacterial, and 3)
allergic. Viral conjunctivitis can be caused by a number of different
viruses, many of which are associated with an upper respiratory tract
infection, cold, or sore throat. Adenoviruses and picornaviruses are
the most common. Viral conjunctivitis is highly contagious. Most
viruses that cause conjunctivitis are spread through direct
hand-to-eye contact by hands that are contaminated with the
infectious virus. Viral conjunctivitis is typically mild, with
symptoms being worst on days 3-5 of infection. The condition usually
clears up in 7-14 days without treatment. Bacterial conjunctivitis
usually begins in one eye and is typically mild, lasting as few as
2-3 days. Further information can be obtained at:
