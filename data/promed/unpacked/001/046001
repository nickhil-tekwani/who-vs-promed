Indonesia: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 7
---------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Indonesia has confirmed an
additional case of human infection with the H5N1 avian
influenza virus. The case, which was fatal, occurred
in a 12-year-old girl from Boyolali, Central Java. She
developed symptoms (fever) on 19 Feb 2006, was
hospitalized on 23 Feb, and died on 1 Mar 2006.
Chickens in her household died in the days preceding
symptom onset.
The girl's 10-year-old brother also fell ill on 19
Feb and died on 28 Feb 2006. As his symptoms were
compatible with a clinical diagnosis of dengue
haemorrhagic fever, no testing for H5N1 was carried
out. It will therefore never be known whether he may
have died following co-infection with dengue and H5N1
avian influenza.
A local investigation was conducted and no additional
cases or symptomatic contacts were found. Rapid tests
detected the H5 virus subtype in chickens from the
children's household.
The newly confirmed case brings the total in Indonesia
to 29. Of these, 22 were fatal.

The Health Ministry confirmed on Friday [17 Mar 2006] that the virus
responsible for the recent deaths of approximately 11 000 turkeys at
the southern kibbutzim of Holit and Ein Hashlosha was indeed the H5
strain. The same strain was identified at Kibbutz Nachshon near Beit
Shemesh, following an unusual number of poultry deaths, and at the
Lachish-area moshav of Sde Moshe. All 4 sites and the areas within 3
kilometers of the areas were placed under veterinary quarantine.
3 people from Kibbutz Ein Hashlosha, including a Thai worker, who
worked at the coops and came into contact with the infected turkeys,
were sent to Soroka Hospital to determine whether they had contracted
the deadly bird flu strain. All 3 were held in isolation, and blood
samples were taken from them.
The Health Ministry ordered the flocks of turkeys on all 4 kibbutzim
destroyed, as well as all those in coops within a 3-kilometer radius
of the infected flocks. The poultry, numbering hundreds of thousands,
will be given water containing poison. The government will compensate
the farmers for their significant financial losses. After its meeting
to discuss the response to the bird flu outbreak, the Agriculture
Ministry announced on Friday that they would continue the veterinary
quarantine over the southern kibbutzim of Holit and Ein Hashlosha.
They also decided to test fowl in other farms in the region. However,
it has not yet been discovered where the deadly virus originated.

3 workers at 2 Negev kibbutzim where more than 1000 turkeys were
found dead Thursday [16 Mar 2006] were taken to Soroka Medical Center
in Be'er Sheva on Friday for treatment of possible avian influenza
virus infection.
One of the patients, a Thai laborer who works at Kibbutz Ein
Hashlosha, is being held in isolation. The other 2, Bedouin from the
Tel Arad region who work at Kibbutz Holit, said they had been feeling
sick for the past few days but could not get off work. Hospital
administrators said test results for the 3 kibbutz workers would be
ready by Sunday [19 Mar 2006].
The possible human infections came as lab tests appeared to confirm
suspicions that more than 1000 turkeys in Ein Hashlosha, Holit and
Nachshon were infected by the deadly H5N1 strain of the bird flu
virus. Meanwhile, the bird flu was suspected of spreading to 2
additional sites on Friday -- Moshav Sde Moshe, near the southern
town of Kiryat Gat, and Kibbutz Nachshon, 25 kilometers from
Jerusalem.
However, the World Health Organization does not view the test
conducted on the turkeys, called PCR, as a definitive confirmation of
the existence of the viral strain. Israel is in the process of
conducting a 2nd stricter test, whose results are expected by Sunday.
Israel decided not to wait for the results of the stricter test,
however, and authorities began preparations Friday to kill tens of
thousands of birds suspected of being infected by bird flu. The
culling, which will be carried out by poisoning the drinking water of
birds within a 3-kilometer radius of the kibbutzim thought to be
affected by the virus, will begin Sunday in all 3 kibbutzim. In
addition, health authorities decided to fly 4 million doses of bird
flu vaccine into Israel from Holland. The government will consider
vaccinating all birds in Israel in an attempt to prevent the virus
from spreading.
The initial confirmation marks the first time that the deadly virus
-- which has killed at least 97 people worldwide and led to the
slaughter of tens of millions of birds -- has been detected in
Israeli birds. Government officials attempted to calm the public,
saying that the chance of human infection was low and that cooked
poultry does not transmit the virus. Ministry officials stressed that
there is no reason for people to stop eating poultry, since the virus
cannot be transmitted via cooked food. However, poultry farmers said
that their main fear is that the public will ignore this reassurance.
Indeed, merchants said demand for poultry products, especially
turkey, was low Friday. Poultry farmers said a panic-driven consumer
boycott of poultry could do their businesses even more harm than the
destruction of their flocks.
The H5N1 virus was detected in neighboring Egypt [in February 2006],
and Agriculture Minister Ze'ev Boim said that the death of the birds
in southern Israel might indicate that the disease entered the
country from Egypt. Another possibility is that the disease entered
from Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces therefore asked the Palestinian
Authority to deliver blood samples of poultry from Gaza Strip hen
houses, in order to determine whether they were the source of the
virus.
Dr Agur, an expert on avian diseases, said that anyone who was in
contact with the affected birds ought to be given immediate
preventive treatment. At Ein Hashlosha, he added, that could include
more than just farmers and veterinarians, since there, "the coops are
inside the kibbutz, so the virus surely exists in every nook and
cranny."
However, the virus can only be caught via close contact with infected
birds. As a result, though the Health Ministry also advised anyone
who has been in contact with the birds on either kibbutz to contact
the local health authority, it does not plan to issue any advisories
to the general public or take any special steps that would affect the
general public.

[Although there have been more than 100 fatalities from avian
influenza virus infection mainly in East Asia, fortunately there have
been few confirmed cases of symptomatic infection among poultry
workers or those involved in culling operations.
