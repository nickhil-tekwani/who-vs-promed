An extremely rare infection has been passed from an organ donor to at least
one recipient in what is thought to be the 1st human-to-human transfer of
the amoeba, medical officials said on Friday [18 Dec 2009].

Four people in 3 states received organs from a patient who died at the
University of Mississippi Medical Center in November 2009 after suffering
from neurological problems, said Dave Daigle, a spokesman for the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Organs are routinely tested for HIV, hepatitis, and other more common
infections, but occasionally rare ones slip through. "We test for the known
harmful diseases, but there's not a test for every single pathogen out
there," said Dr Kenneth Kokko, medical director of kidney transplants at UMMC.

Two of the recipients are critically ill, but the others haven't shown
symptoms, Daigle said. CDC confirmed the presence of the organism, known as
_Balamuthia mandrillaris_, in one of the recipients. Dr Shirley
Schlessinger, a UMMC doctor and medical director of the Mississippi Organ
Recovery Agency, would not say which states had patients receiving the
organs. The public should not be concerned, both Schlessinger and Daigle said.

_Balamuthia mandrillaris_ is a microscopic parasite found in soil that
causes encephalitis in humans, horses, dogs, sheep and nonhuman primates.
Scientists think people get infected by breathing it in, but it can also
pass into the blood through a cut or break in the skin. It can be
especially dangerous to people undergoing organ transplants, whose immune
systems are purposely weakened so their bodies don't reject their new organs.

Human infections are very rare: only about 150 cases have been reported
worldwide since the disease was 1st identified in 1990. But it can be hard
to diagnose because few laboratories test for it, and many doctors don't
know about it. Some cases are not identified until autopsy, according to
CDC. "The thing we don't want to happen is for people to take this rare and
extraordinary anomaly and think it speaks to a lack of safety," she [CDC
spokesperson? - Mod.SH] said. "It's very rare, so the likelihood that this
will happen again (is small); I mean, it's rarer than rabies." There are
risks to transplants, and doctors can't test for everything, but the
potential benefits far outweigh the risks, she said.

[It is surprising that the infection could have been asymptomatic in the
donor. The report does not provide any information on how the donor came to
be in a situation in which organs were used for transplantation. If the
donor did not have any sign of an infectious disease in the central nervous
system, it may indicate that perhaps _Balamuthia mandrillaris_ may exist in
a human without any symptoms. This is new.

Information on _Balamuthia mandrillaris_ can be found at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balamuthia_mandrillaris>, and the life cycle
can be found at <http://www.dpd.cdc.gov/dpdx/HTML/FreeLivingAmebic.htm>. -
