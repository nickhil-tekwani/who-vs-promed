Camel link in Malaysian case
----------------------------
Today's [17 Apr 2014] WHO statement [http://www.who.int/csr/don/2014_04_17_mers/en/] also adds information on the case reported yesterday [16 Apr 2014] in a Malaysian man who died of MERS-CoV after a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. His case and that of the Filipino are the 1st MERS cases reported in the Far East.

The Malaysian man, 54, traveled to Saudi Arabia with a group of 18 pilgrims and was away from 15 to 28 Mar 2014. While visiting a camel farm on 26 Mar 2014, he drank camel milk, the WHO said. The man fell ill after returning home and died on 13 Apr 2014.

Studies have suggested that MERS-CoV is fairly common in camels in Saudi Arabia and neighboring countries, and one or 2 human MERS patients were found to have had contact with infected camels. Thus camels are strongly suspected to be a source of MERS-CoV in humans, but the precise transmission route is unknown.

In a study published last week [week of 7 Apr 2014] in Emerging Infectious Diseases [see reference below], researchers found that MERS-CoV could survive in camel milk for at least 72 hours. But they didn't examine whether the virus is actually found in the milk of infected camels

Abstract
--------
A prospective study of a dromedary camel herd during the 2013-14 calving season showed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV] infection of calves and adults. Virus was isolated from the nose and feces but more frequently from the nose. Preexisting neutralizing antibody did not appear to protect against infection.

[Selected extracts:
"We studied dromedaries at 2 farms in Al-Hasa, 4-5 km [2.5-3.1 mi] apart.

"Farm A had 70 animals; 4 were 1 month of age, 8 were approximately 1 year of age, and the rest were adults (2 years of age or older). The herd did not go to pasture in the desert ("zero-grazing"; type of grazing may influence types of potential exposures). The animals were sampled on 5 occasions during November 2013-February 2014.

"Farm B ("semi-zero-grazing") had 17 adults and 3 calves; its herd was sampled in February 2014. Nasal, oral, or rectal swab samples and blood samples were collected.

"At farm A, we detected MERS-CoV in 1 of 4 dromedaries sampled on 30 Nov 2013, none of 11 sampled on 4 Dec 2013, 9 of 11 sampled on 30 Dec 2013, and none of 9 sampled on 14 Feb 2014.

"Dromedaries from farm B were sampled once on 11 Feb 2014; all results were negative.

[The tests from both farms are presented in] Table 1 at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/7/14-0571-t1.htm.

"Of the 10 dromedaries that tested positive for MERS-CoV [Farm A] , 9 had parallel nasal and fecal specimens tested, with virus detected in the nasal swab specimens from 8 and the fecal specimen from 1. At the 30 Dec 2013 sampling, 7 of 8 calves and 2 of 3 adults tested positive for MERS-CoV, indicating that when MERS-CoV circulates on a farm, both calves and adults can be infected. Overall, the data suggest that prior infection or passively acquired maternal antibody might not provide complete protection from infection.

"4 MERS-CoV-positive calves had mild respiratory signs (cough, sneezing, respiratory discharge), abnormally elevated body temperature" [recorded temps will be helpful. - Mod.AS] "and loss of appetite at the 30 Dec 2013 sampling, which resolved over a few days. 3 calves from which paired serum samples were available demonstrated more than 4-fold rising antibody titers to MERS-CoV. Calf no 13 (1 year of age) had a high viral load and was seronegative at the 1st MERS-CoV-positive result (indicating that it had been recently infected) but was MERS-CoV RNA negative 6 weeks later, suggesting that virus shedding is not prolonged. We did not detect virus RNA by RT-PCR in the 3 acute-phase serum samples from infected dromedaries, suggesting that acute infection is not associated with prolonged viremia." - Mod.AS]

A Saudi expert on infectious diseases on Thursday [17 Apr 2014] reaffirmed the link between the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and camels after research proved that the viruses isolated from a Saudi patient and his camel were 100 percent similar.

"We have succeeded in isolating the coronavirus and proving the role of camels in transmitting this deadly virus to humans," said Dr Tariq Ahmed Madani of the King Abdulaziz University Hospital in Jeddah.

Speaking with Arab News, he said the discovery proves that camels are the prime reservoir that allowed the coronavirus to infect and kill humans. "This does not mean camels are the only source," he said. "This important discovery will help combat and contain the disease," said Madani, who obtained a fellowship in infectious diseases from the University of Manitoba in Canada.

A total of 72 people have died from MERS out of 212 infected cases in Saudi Arabia.

Madani emphasized the need to enlighten the public on the disease, especially residents dealing with camels.

He said a research paper on the discovery of the virus would be published in a specialized scientific magazine soon. "This advanced scientific discovery reflects the progress achieved by Saudi Arabia in the medical field," Madani said.

Research on the topic began in November 2013, when a 44-year-old Saudi who was suffering from pneumonia was admitted to the university hospital. He died after 15 days later after his body failed to respond positively to customary treatment.

"We isolated [the virus] and succeeded in determining [its] genetic sequence. A specialized medical team then isolated the same virus from one of the camels owned by the patient," said Madani. "We found antibodies for the virus in a herd of 9 camels owned by the patient and discovered that these antibodies appeared before the patient was infected. As a result, we were able to prove for the 1st time that camels are one of the carriers of the virus to humans," he said.

Patients contract MERS either by direct contact with an infected patient, especially through droplets while speaking, sneezing or coughing, or touching the belongings or objects touched by an infected person. "It can also spread through direct contact with infected camels," he said. "Infected camels could show symptoms similar to those manifested by humans."

"Most reported MERS cases in the world spread from human to human and they had no direct contact with infected camels," Dr Madani said.

"There is no proof so far to suggest that drinking the milk of an infected camel can cause the disease," he said. "Nevertheless, it is advisable to only drink camel milk, or any other type of milk for that matter, after boiling to kill disease-causing germs, including Malta fever [brucellosis], found in the Najd and Hijaz regions."

Madani said that the King Fahd Research Center at the university has not yet conducted any research to find a cure for the disease due to lack of human and material resources.

"No report of MERS-related death among camels has been reported so far," he said.

The National Scientific Committee for Infectious Diseases (NSCID) has organized field visits in Jeddah to acquire 1st-hand information about the virus in the wake of the sudden increase in the number of cases.

The Ministry of Health has extended an invitation to the World Health Organization to send experts to evaluate the prevalence of the coronavirus in Jeddah and in other parts of the Kingdom.

According to the health official, the Health Ministry is on 24-hour alert to monitor the virus both within and outside the Kingdom.

[A paper addressing the case referred to in item 3 was mentioned in part 2 of posting 20140325.2356854 (paper available at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/6/14-0402_article.htm ). It would help to know if Prof Madani was referring to this one or to another paper; in case of the latter - details such as journal name and URL link will be helpful.

According to WHO's most recent update, globally, from Sep 2012 to 17 Apr 2014, a total of 243 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV have been informed to the WHO. How many of them have been epidemiologically investigated? And of those investigated, how many have possibly been exposed to direct or indirect contact with camels or their products, including meat and milk, raw or processed? - Mod.AS
