[Since the beginning of 2019 there have been 2 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia. Both cases were from Riyadh city in Riyadh, with the 2nd case, confirmed today (Fri 4 Jan 2019), a household contact, most likely of the 1st case (reported as a confirmed case on Tue 1 Jan 2019).

Reviewing my spreadsheet, during the calendar year of 2018 (1 Jan 2018 to 31 Dec 2018), I have information on 145 newly confirmed cases reported by Saudi Arabia. Outcomes were available on 126 of these cases, with 43 reported to have died (a reported case fatality rate of 29.6%) and 83 reported to have recovered. Classifications of the cases were available on 143 cases: 108 (75.5%) were classified as primary community acquired cases, 22 (15.4%) were classified as secondary cases in household contacts, and 12 (8.4%) were classified as secondary healthcare-associated cases. Of the primary cases, 48 (44.4%) had known history of contact with camels, and 60 (55.6%) denied having contact with camels. Of the healthcare-associated cases, 5 (41.7%) occurred in healthcare workers. Cases occurred in 13 different regions: Al Ahsaa, Al Bahah, Al á¸¤udud ash Shamaliyah, Al Jawf, Al Madinah, Al Qasim, Ash Sharqiyah, Asir, Hail, Makkah, Najran, Riyadh, and Tabuk. There were no large outbreaks associated with healthcare facilities, a positive change from previous years.
