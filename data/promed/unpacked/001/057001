12 children are in hospital, 4 seriously ill, after contracting _E.
coli_ in an outbreak at a children's farm. All the children are aged
under 10. The Health Protection Agency says 36 cases have been reported so far.

The children are thought to have caught the bug at Godstone Farm in
Surrey, which also has a playground. The attraction receives up to
2000 visitors a day in the summer. It has been temporarily closed.

The outbreak is believed to have started on 8 Aug 2009. The bacterium
causes diarrhea and can lead to kidney failure, especially in young
children. It is fatal in very rare cases. The director of the Surrey
and Sussex Health Protection Unit, Dr Angela Iversen, said it was a
"large outbreak" of _E. coli_.

She said: "The farm owners are cooperating fully, and we are working
closely with them and with colleagues across health and local
authorities to investigate the source. Our advice is that the farm
should remain closed to visitors while this work goes on."
