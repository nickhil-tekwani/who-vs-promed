[On the same date (20 Jun 2018) as the immediate notification above of a new FMD event, the CVO of the Palestinian Auton. Territories (PAT) submitted to the OIE a follow-up report no. 3 (aka "final report") of an earlier FMD event. The said event involved 5 outbreaks in sheep, goats, and cattle in Hebron district, the south-western part of the West Bank, PAT, which started 3 Nov 2017; the last (5th) outbreak started 20 Dec 2017. This event has now been informed as resolved since 30 Jan 2018. For the event's summary, including a map presenting the 5 outbreaks, see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=25419.

The virus which caused the above-mentioned November-December 2017 PAT event was genotyped by WRLFMD as FMDV serotype O, topotype EA3, a virus strain known to circulate in several east-African countries and in neighboring Egypt. The detailed genotyping results are available at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2018/WRLFMD-2018-00004-Palestinian-AT-O-approved.pdf. This virus strain had caused, earlier in 2017, several outbreaks in the Gaza strip and entered Israel, infecting a single cattle operation adjacent to the Gaza strip (see 20170404.4947711).

Silat ad-Dhahr, the location of the new outbreak reported in the immediate notification above, is a Palestinian village in the Jenin governorate, 14 km (about 9 mi) east to the demarcation line ("green line") between the Palestinian Authority and Israel's territories, midway between Jenin and Nablus, and 30-35 km (about 19-22 mi) from the closest recent FMD outbreak in north east Israel (map at https://tinyurl.com/yah9jpgj). It is more than 90 km/about 56 mi (and 7 months) distant from the earlier FMD cluster in the Palestinian Authority (Hebron district); the current virus strain could rather be related to the recent outbreak in North-East Israel, where a new FMD event, caused by a newly introduced FMDV-O strain (topotype ME-SA, lineage PanAsia-2QOM-15) started, reportedly, on 2 Apr 2018, in the vicinity of the 3-country junction (Israel/Jordan/Syria).

Until 29 Apr 2018 (date of Israel's last follow-up report), a total of 5 outbreaks, due to the said newly introduced virus strain, have been reported to the OIE. The event's last summary with map are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=26394.

Additional outbreaks have been noted in the same region in cattle and wildlife (wild gazelles, a captive deer), as far west as Affula, (see 20180515.5798415 and 20180607.5843979).

The virus strain behind the current outbreak in Silat ad-Dhahr is yet to be serotyped and genotyped. In case it is found identical/similar to the strain (FMDV-O EA3) circulating in north-east Israel, this may be indicative of wide continuing circulation of this virus in territories west to the Jordan river. Particularly, if the cows were infected, as suggested by the owner, by "newly introduced straw from a new source to his farm."

Enhanced surveillance and alertness in Jordan and Syria should be in place. - Mods.AS/CRD
