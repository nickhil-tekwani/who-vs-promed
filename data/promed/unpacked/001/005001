At least 500 gulls have been found dead with evidence of poisoning since
the weekend in St. John's, Newfoundland.
Dumped human food may have caused the sudden deaths of the seabirds, local
chief veterinarian Hugh Whitney said in his initial report released Tuesday.
"A lot of them have human food in their mouths," such as bits of hot dogs,
potatoes, meat, peas and beans, he said after examining the bodies of the
dead birds. That seems to be the one common factor so far," he stated,
adding there are forensic clues for another incidence of botulism.
Tens of thousands of ducks and shorebirds have died of avian botulism at
Whitewater Lake, Manitoba since 1996, with up to 117 000 birds found dead
in the year alone.
The Canadian Wildlife Service is conducting a study to examine the causes
of avian botulism outbreaks.

the maggots form carcasses of dead birds not picked up. The problem could
