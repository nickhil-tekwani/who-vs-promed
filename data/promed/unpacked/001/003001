The Ghana Medical Association has announced that as of 26 Nov 2021, 40 persons have died as a result of a yellow fever outbreak in the country. The disease which was first detected in the Savannah Region has since spread to 7 other regions.

"We express our deepest condolences to those who have lost loved ones to this disease," the Association stated.

It added that the Ministry of Health has put in place adequate measures to contain the outbreak with appropriate case definition, case management, and vaccination measures.

The Association further urged Ghanaians, especially those in the affected areas to avail themselves to be vaccinated against the yellow fever disease.

"We urge all persons in Ghana, especially those in the affected areas to cooperate with the ongoing vaccination exercise and report any suspected cases (the development of fever and yellowing of eyes within 14 days of the fever) to the nearest health facility for appropriate diagnosis and management," the Association stated in a press statement.

"We commend the tremendous efforts by our public health physicians and all health workers who are braving the odds to help the nation combat the current outbreak," it concluded.

[The number of yellow fever (YF) fatalities continues to increase and spread geographically in Ghana. On 17 Nov 2021 the number of YF deaths was 25 in 4 regions, on 26 Nov 2021 there were 39 fatal cases in 5 regions, and now the YF fatal case total is 40 in 8 regions. The health services are intensifying vaccination campaign efforts to halt the outbreak. The YF vaccination campaign and increased surveillance, both now under way, are essential to control this outbreak.

A previous report indicated that in the affected areas only 60% of the residents are reported to have been vaccinated. One hopes that this percentage will reach at least 80% in the coming days and bring this outbreak to a halt. If there are abundant populations of YF virus vector mosquitoes present in an area where a large proportion of the population is unvaccinated, YF can quickly get out of hand. - Mod.TY
