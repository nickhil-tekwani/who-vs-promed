Brazil has confirmed 1157 [yellow fever] cases and 342 deaths during the period 1 Jul 2017 - 17 Apr of this year [2018]. During the same period last year [2017], there were 733 confirmed cases and 241 deaths.

The Ministry of Health this Thursday (19 [Apr 2018]) updated the information sent in by the state secretariats of health about the yellow fever situation in the country. During the monitoring period (from 1 Jul 2017 - 17 Apr 2018) there were 1157 confirmed cases of yellow fever in the country and 342 deaths. In total, there were 5131 notified suspected cases with 2951 now discarded and 1023 still under investigation.

Last year [2017], considering the same monitoring period (July 2016 - 17 Apr 2017), there were 733 cases and 241 deaths confirmed. The reports of yellow fever continue since last year [2017], indicating the seasonality of the disease that occurs mainly in the summer season. Given this, the period for analysis is considered to be 1 Jul - 30 Jun of each year.

Cases during the current monitoring period have been greater than in the past season; the yellow fever virus today circulates in metropolitan regions of the country that contain the greatest contingent of the population, reaching 35.9 million residents, including in areas that have never been recommended for vaccination. In the past [transmission] season, for example, the outbreak reached a population of 11.7 million people.

This explains why the disease incidence in the current period is less than the past one. The incidence in the monitoring period 2017-2018, as of 17 Apr [2018], is 3 cases per 100 000 inhabitants. In the past season, 2016-2017, the incidence was 6.2 per 100 000 in the same period. [The population at risk is much greater this season. - Mod.TY]

The entire Brazilian territory will be the area of recommendation [for vaccination] against yellow fever. This will be carried out gradually, beginning this year [2018] and to be concluded by April 2019. This expansion is preventive and has as its objective the protection of the entire population against the disease in case there is an increase in the area of virus circulation.

[The pattern of slow but continuous increase in yellow fever cases includes the major metropolitan municipalities of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, which is of concern. The report above provides a good update on the current YF situation in Brazil. There is no indication that the outbreak has ended. As noted previously, although there still have been no reports of cases from the urban, _Aedes aegypti_, cycle of transmission, the risk remains that spillover from the sylvan (forest) cycle could occur. _Aedes aegypti_ vector mosquitoes are present in the area and responsible for the transmission of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses. It is important to note from the case numbers above that cases of YF in humans and monkeys are occurring in areas outside of the 3 states where the main outbreak is occurring. There is risk of new human cases and outbreaks in other areas, so that surveillance in a broad area of Brazil is important. Expansion of the area for vaccination to ultimately include the entire country is prudent but ambitious. No comment is made above about the availability of vaccine for the 77.5 million people to be covered or whether a fractionated or full dose of the vaccine will be administered. - Mod.TY
