--------------------------------------------------------------------

In Morocco, _Pectobacterium carotovorum_ is described as the main causative agent of blackleg and soft rot diseases on several plants and crops including _Solanum tuberosum_. In March 2016, blackleg symptoms were observed in commercial potato fields in the North of Morocco. Isolation of pectinolytic bacteria was performed.

To determine the identity of the potential pectinobacteria, PCR has been used targeting the pelADE genes. Sixty nine isolates were identified as _Pectobacterium_ spp. and 20 as _Dickeya_ spp. 10 Dickeya isolates were subjected to PCR targeting the dnaX and rrs 16S rDNA genes. Both dnaX and rrs sequences showed 100 per cent and 97 per cent identity with published _D. dianthicola_ sequences, respectively. A Multilocus Sequence Analysis (MLSA) of the concatenated 16S rDNA and dnaX gene fragments of the Moroccan isolates in comparison with complete genomes from _D. chrysanthemi_ NCPPB 516, _D. dadantii_ 3937, _D. dianthicola_ RNS049, _D. solani 3337_, _D. zeae_ 1591 and _P. atrosepticum_ CFBP6276 showed that all Moroccan _Dickeya_ strains were clustered in the _D. dianthicola_ clade.

Koch's postulates were completed on potato plants in order to verify the pathogenicity of the 10 Moroccan _D. dianthicola_ isolates. Six plants were infected by each of the isolates. All inoculated stems showed black, rotten stems, but control plants remained symptomless.

In conclusion, molecular and symptomatic analysis demonstrated the occurrence of _D. dianthicola_ from some potato fields in Morocco, and showed that _D. dianthicola_ strains are virulent on potato. These findings will increase awareness and offer new technologies to avoid the spread of _Dickeya_ in potatoes.

[Blackleg of potato can be caused by several species and subspecies of bacteria in the genera _Pectobacterium_ and _Dickeya_. Symptoms may include stem rot leading to leaf yellowing, wilting and stunting of plants, as well as tuber rot, which usually starts at the stem end of the tuber. The bacteria are spread with contaminated plant or other material (including seed tubers), by mechanical means, and water. Disease management may include seed tuber handling and cultural techniques, use of clean planting material and phytosanitation to prevent introduction of the pathogen from external sources. Low levels of seed tuber infection pose a major risk of pathogen spread, and certification schemes are a vital part of disease management for these pathogens.

Population shifts of the blackleg pathogens are being observed in many areas. For example, _P. atrosepticum_ was considered to be the main blackleg pathogen in Europe, until the emergence of the more virulent new species _D. solani_ (ProMED-mail post 20091207.4162). _P. wasabiae_ and _D. dianthicola_ are also known to cause the disease in Europe. In the US, _D. dianthicola_ has been known to be present on ornamentals but has only recently been observed on potato (ProMED-mail post 20160509.4211696). _D. solani_ has not yet been detected in the Americas. _P. carotovorum_ subsp. _brasiliensis_ (Pcb) has been reported as a causal agent from a number of countries in different parts of the world, and in the Netherlands it has replaced a predominant _D. solani_ within just a few years (ProMED-mail post 20160128.3974722). Possible reasons for these population shifts are thought to be climate changes and selection pressure due to intensified agriculture.

_Pectobacterium_ and _Dickeya_ species or subspecies also cause bacterial soft rot of potato. The pathogens can also affect other crops, causing, for example, a foot rot disease in rice as well as stem and root rot of sweet potato.
