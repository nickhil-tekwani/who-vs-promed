First Report of _Puccinia polysora_ on Corn in Argentina.

Corn (_Zea mays_ L.) is an important crop in northwest Argentina but
acreage [of the crop] has declined over the last several years due to
disease problems.
During the 2000-2001 growing season, leaf diseases were observed on corn
growing in northeastern Tucuman Province (Departamiento Leales),
[resulting] in yield losses. One of the most prevalent diseases was caused
by a rust fungus that produced both uredinial and telial stages. At ...
flowering [stage] 32 percent of the leaf area was infected, and [69
percent] 3 weeks later.
[The fungus was identified as _Puccinia polysora_ Underw.], ...one of 3
rust fungi known from corn (2), based on the morphology of the 2 types of
sori and spores (1). Tucuman Province, where the disease was observed, is a
subtropical region with temperatures during the growing season above 24
degrees C and a relative humidity above 90 percent.
_P. polysora_ has not been observed in the Pampas Humedas, the corn belt of
Argentina, possibly because the area is more temperate than northwest
Argentina and therefore the environment is not conducive to disease
development, or perhaps [the fungus] has not been introduced into the region.
Although known from most tropical and subtropical regions, to our
knowledge, this is the first report of _P. polysora_ in Argentina (voucher
BPI 841342).

[_Puccinia polysora_, first identified in Alabama, USA on _Tripsacum
dactiloides_ (Eastern gamma grass) in 1891, causes southern rust in maize.
It also infects other _Tripsacum_, 2 Erianthus spp. and _Zea mays_ spp.
_mexicana_ (teosinte). The disease caused significant losses (over 50
percent) in the late 1940's in West Africa. Southern rust now occurs in
most of sub-saharan Africa, southeast Asia, Australia, Mauritius, the
Philippines, Indonesia, Taiwan, and Southern India.
In the USA southern corn rust is found throughout the midwestern and
southern states in fields of sweet and field corn. The fungus has no known
means of survival in the absence of living susceptible plants. Inoculum for
southern rust overwinters in the extreme southern portion of the United
States, Mexico, and the Caribbean. Rust spores are blown from the southern
areas each year into the midwestern corn belt. The disease is favored by
warm, humid conditions found in lowland areas where corn is grown in the
southern states. Registered fungicides can be used as a means of
control. - Mod.DH]
