A nasal brush test can rapidly and accurately diagnose Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), an incurable and ultimately fatal neurodegenerative disorder, according to a study by National Institutes of Health (NIH) scientists and their Italian colleagues.

Up to now, a definitive CJD diagnosis required testing brain tissue obtained after death or by biopsy in living patients. The study describing the less invasive nasal test appears in the 7 Aug 2014 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1315200.

CJD is a prion disease. These diseases originate when, for reasons not fully understood, normally harmless prion protein molecules become abnormal and gather in clusters. Prion diseases affect animals and people. Human prion diseases include variant, familial and sporadic CJD. The most common form, sporadic CJD, affects an estimated one in one million people annually worldwide. Other prion diseases include scrapie in sheep; chronic wasting disease in deer, elk and moose; and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, in cattle. Scientists have associated the accumulation of these clusters with tissue damage that leaves sponge-like holes in the brain.

"This exciting advance, the culmination of decades of studies on prion diseases, markedly improves on available diagnostic tests for CJD that are less reliable, more difficult for patients to tolerate, and require more time to obtain results," said Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a component of NIH. "With additional validation, this test has potential for use in clinical and agricultural settings." The test developed by NIH and Italian scientists involves the insertion of a rigid fiber-optic rhinoscope into the patient's nasal cavity. A sterile brush is then inserted alongside the scope to collect olfactory neurons by gently rolling along the mucosal surface.

An easy-to-use diagnostic test would let doctors clearly differentiate prion diseases from other brain diseases, according to Byron Caughey, Ph.D., the lead NIAID scientist involved in the study. Although specific CJD treatments are not available, prospects for their development and effectiveness could be enhanced by early and accurate diagnoses. Further, a test that identifies people with various forms of prion diseases could help to prevent the spread of prion diseases among and between species. For instance, it is known that human prion diseases can be transmitted via medical procedures such as blood transfusions, transplants and the contamination of surgical instruments. People also have contracted variant CJD after exposure to BSE-infected cattle.

The NIAID study involved 31 nasal samples from patients with CJD and 43 nasal samples from patients who had other neurologic diseases or no neurologic disease at all. These samples were collected primarily by Gianluigi Zanusso, M.D., Ph.D., and colleagues at the University of Verona in Italy, who developed the technique of brushing the inside of the nose to collect olfactory neurons connected to the brain. Testing in Dr. Caughey's lab in Montana then correctly identified 30 of the 31 CJD patients (97 percent sensitivity) and correctly showed negative results for all 43 of the non-CJD patients (100 percent specificity). By comparison, tests using cerebral spinal fluid -- currently used to detect sporadic CJD -- were 77 percent sensitive and 100 percent specific, and the results took twice as long to obtain.

Jason Wilham, Ph.D., Christina Orru, Ph.D., Dr. Caughey, and other members of his research group had previously developed the cerebral spinal fluid test method with Ryuichiro Atarashi, M.D., Ph.D., a former NIAID postdoctoral fellow who is now at Nagasaki University in Japan. While continuing to validate the test method in CJD patients, Dr. Caughey's group is looking to expand the study to diagnose forms of prion diseases in sheep, cattle and wildlife. The team continues to collaborate with Dr. Zanusso's group, which is looking to replace the nasal brush with an even simpler swabbing approach.

NIAID conducts and supports research -- at NIH, throughout the United States, and worldwide -- to study the causes of infectious and immune-mediated diseases and to develop better means of preventing, diagnosing and treating these illnesses.

[The following is the abstract transcript from the paper now published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The future value of this procedure may depend on its ability to discriminate the different forms of CJD, sporadic, genetic, iatrogenic and variant.

A Test for Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Using Nasal Brushings/ by Christina D. Orru, Ph.D., Matilde Bongianni, Ph.D., Giovanni Tonoli, M.D., Sergio Ferrari, M.D., Andrew G. Hughson, M.S., Bradley R. Groveman, Ph.D., Michele Fiorini, Ph.D., Maurizio Pocchiari, M.D., Salvatore Monaco, M.D., Byron Caughey, Ph.D., and Gianluigi Zanusso, M.D., Ph.D. N Engl J Med 2014; 371:519-529 7 Aug 2014. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1315200 http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1315200.

Background: Definite diagnosis of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in living patients remains a challenge. A test that detects the specific marker for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the prion protein (PrPCJD), by means of real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) testing of cerebrospinal fluid has a sensitivity of 80 to 90 percent for the diagnosis of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. We have assessed the accuracy of RT-QuIC analysis of nasal brushings from olfactory epithelium in diagnosing sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in living patients.

Methods: We collected olfactory epithelium brushings and cerebrospinal fluid samples from patients with and patients without sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and tested them using RT-QuIC, an ultrasensitive, multiwell plate-based fluorescence assay involving PrPCJD-seeded polymerization of recombinant PrP into amyloid fibrils.

Results: The RT-QuIC assays seeded with nasal brushings were positive in 30 of 31 patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (15 of 15 with definite sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, 13 of 14 with probable sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and 2 of 2 with inherited Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) but were negative in 43 of 43 patients without Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, indicating a sensitivity of 97 percent (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 82 to 100) and specificity of 100 percent (95 percent CI, 90 to 100) for the detection of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. By comparison, testing of cerebrospinal fluid samples from the same group of patients had a sensitivity of 77 percent (95 percent CI, 57 to 89) and a specificity of 100 percent (95 percent CI, 90 to 100). Nasal brushings elicited stronger and faster RT-QuIC responses than cerebrospinal fluid (P less than 0.001 for the between-group comparison of strength of response). Individual brushings contained approximately 105 to 107 prion seeds, at concentrations several logs10 greater than in cerebrospinal fluid.

Conclusions: In this preliminary study, RT-QuIC testing of olfactory epithelium samples obtained from nasal brushings was accurate in diagnosing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and indicated substantial prion seeding activity lining the nasal vault." - Mod.CP]
