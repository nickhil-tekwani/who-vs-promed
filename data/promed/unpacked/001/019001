The Corsica prefecture indicates in a press release as follows:

"The sanitary surveillance exercised in Corsica leads to alert the breeders on the evolution of bluetongue [BT] on the territory; 2 outbreaks have been confirmed on flocks of sheep in Haute Corse [Upper Corsica] and in Corse-du-Sud [Southern Corsica] on 13 and 15 Oct 2021, respectively."

The prefecture also reports that "Some suspicions raised by veterinarians in the field are currently being investigated by the laboratory. This is serotype 4, which has been circulating enzootically in Corsica for many years, but the 2 outbreaks involve animals showing clinical signs for the 1st time this year: drop in milk production, breathing difficulties, problems during lambing. The virus is transmitted by insects (_Culicoides_); the favorable season for the appearance of this disease is winter [see comment]."

The prefectural authority, which recalls that "vaccination allows the attenuation of clinical signs and the limitation of economic losses," recommends "increased surveillance of the herds."

State services once again recommend "breeders to contact their veterinarian in order to set up, if this has not already been done, vaccination against BT." They also recommend "leading the fight against vector insects, on animals and in buildings."

An information meeting incorporating health protection group, the sheep industry, and veterinarians, will take place on Tue 19 Oct 2021.

Corsica, an island in the Mediterranean Sea, one of the 18 regions of France, is divided into 2 administrative departments, Upper and Southern Corsica. The detection of bluetongue [BT] outbreaks in each of them may predict a wide spread of this vector-borne virus, affecting unvaccinated animals.

The previous BT outbreak in Corsica was recorded in the southern part of the island in November 2016. The location of the infected farm and the sequence data suggested that BTV-4 had been introduced from Sardinia, where BTV-4 outbreaks were reported during autumn 2016. They were considered to occur either by wind-borne movements of adult _Culicoides_ midges (12 km [7.4 mi] between the 2 islands) or by the introduction of infected animals.

BT first appeared in Corsica in 2000, caused by BTV-2, most likely originating from the island of Sardinia. In 2003, a similar event was caused by BTV-4. In 2004, a new serotype, BTV-16, was detected. In 2013, BTV-1 was identified in the south of Corsica; molecular data strongly suggested that the virus was introduced from Sardinia, where many outbreaks of BTV-1 had been reported during autumn 2012 and summer 2013 (Ref 1). In all these events, sheep were the most affected species.

BTV-4 is currently known to circulate in the western Mediterranean basin, including the Maghreb, Spain's Andalusia and Extremadura, southern Portugal, the Ballearic islands, and Sardinia. In difference with the statement in the above Corsican report, the vector activity season in this region has been known to occur between August and early December, peaking in September-November. It remains to be seen if climatic changes are to affect this pattern.
