State health officials are asking Texans to be careful around rat and mice nests after confirming 2 more cases of hantavirus [pulmonary syndrome, HPS] this month [July 2014].

The Texas Department of State Health Services reported a total of 3 cases so far this year, one in the Texas Panhandle and 2 in the South Plains area [in northwest Texas].

Texas had one case last year [2013], and no cases were reported from 2009 to 2012, according to the state. 1/3rd of cases reported to the state health department since 1993 have resulted in death.

Infected rats and mice shed the virus in their urine, droppings and saliva, which contaminate dust and nesting materials that humans breathe in. Health officials recommend sealing openings to homes and workplaces while removing food sources and piles of items that attract rats and mice. If nests are found, the area should be ventilated for at least 30 minutes and then dampened using a 1-to-10 bleach-water mixture twice, according to the state. Goggles and masks are recommended.

HPS symptoms include fatigue, fever muscle aches at 1st, followed by headaches, chills, diarrhea, abdominal pain, coughing and shortness of breath.

[Cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) have occurred in Texas sporadically for 21 years. A total of 41 HPS cases have been confirmed in Texas since 1993, the 1st year it was reported. Death resulted in 14 of those cases. This year (2014), 2 of the above cases were reported in the previous ProMED-mail post of 8 Jul 2014 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140711.2601701). This report does not indicate the sexes or ages of the patients, the specific locations in Texas where the infections occurred, nor the dates when the infections occurred in 2014. Although not stated in the above report, the virus involved in these HPS cases probably is Sin Nombre virus (SNV), which is endemic in deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_), including in Texas. Although Sin Nombre virus infections with HPS are relatively rare, the risk of death is significant. Individuals cleaning areas where the mice may be present are well advised to heed the above recommendations in order to avoid exposure.
