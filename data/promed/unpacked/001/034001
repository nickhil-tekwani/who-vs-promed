VANCOUVER (CP) - B.C. epidemiologists are searching for the source of a
rare strain of bacteria that has so far infected 40 people -- mostly young
children -- in the Vancouver area. In most years, about five cases of
_Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ are reported in British Columbia. During the
last decade there have been only a handful of outbreaks reported worldwide,
mainly in Japan.
"This is not something scientists have a lot of expertise with," said Dr.
Murray Fyfe, associate director of epidemiology for the B.C. Centre for
Disease Control.
The bacterium, which despite its name, has no relation to tuberculosis,
causes infection in the bowel. Symptoms include fever, vomiting, lower
abdominal pain and diarrhea. Infection can mimic appendicitis and some
people might think they have acquired food poisoning or a nasty stomach flu.
The bacteria are not highly contagious, although they are shed in the stool
for two weeks after infection. Most people recover without treatment,
although some may experience joint pain for weeks or months. Children who
have severe symptoms and adults with compromised immune systems may recover
more quickly with antibiotics.
Fyfe said scientists noticed the increasing number of Yersinia cases last
week. Of the 40 people infected so far, 24 are under three years old.
"We're still looking for the common factor," Fyfe said. "We don't have any
solid evidence yet. The best guess on the source so far is food. Drinking
pasteurized milk and eating well-cooked pork will decrease the risk of
infection." The bacterium is found in farm animals, particularly pigs, as
well as pets and wild animals. Scientists will begin testing food samples
and interviewing people this week but it may take weeks to track the source.
