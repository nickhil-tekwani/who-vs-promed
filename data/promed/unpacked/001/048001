According to the Federal Food Agency, the sheep disease Bluetongue
has been detected now also in Belgium on 11 farms in the provinces
Luik [Liege] and Limburg [Limbourg]. [Map at
<http://www.supertravelnet.com/maps/index.php?action=showmap&country=116_0_4&language=1>].
This is related to cows which have been sick in recent days and now
tested for Bluetongue. The disease has been detected also in some sheep.
The Food agency has notified the cases to the European Commission.
The restricted areas established in Belgium following the Dutch
notification of an outbreak on the border, have now been extended.

[The detection of disease in Belgium is not surprising; the infected
location in the Netherlands, Kerkrade, is bordering Belgium (and very
close to Germany!). It seems that cattle which showed (undescribed)
disease symptoms several days ago, have been tested now for
Bluetongue, in view of the Dutch outbreak, and found positive
(serologically?). Clinical Bluetongue in cattle is exceptional. This
finding might also imply an earlier primary focus, potentially
undetected due to lack of symptoms in cattle, which are the preferred
feeding source for culicoides.
The Belgian authorities declared vast parts of their national
territory under surveillance and animal movement restrictions already
on 17 Aug 2006, immediately following the detection of Bluetongue in
Kerkrade. A map showing the declared regions, updated 19 Aug 2006, is
available at
<http://www.afsca.be/sp/pa-sa-mal-ani/doc/blue_tongue/J118_afbakening_zones_v2_20060819_nl+fr.pdf>.
Hopefully, the serotype involved (in both countries) will be
determined soon to allow vaccination of susceptible sheep in the
Netherlands, Belgium and, most probably, also in adjacent areas in
Germany. - Mod.AS]

Bluetongue is transmitted by midges (culicoides). There are at
present at least 3 species of those midges: _Culicoides obsoletus_,
_C. pulicaris_ and _C. impunctatus_. _C. obsoletus_ and _C.
pulicaris_ are expected to be the more important transmitters of
Bluetongue virus (BTV). Both are rather abundant in peat moor areas.
There might be other species as well, but they seem of lesser importance.
BTV has been spreading in south Europe -- the Iberian peninsular,
France, Italy, Greece, Turkey and Balkan countries during the last 10
years, causing great losses. The vector there is _C. imicola_, a
species which does not occur in western and northern Europe.
On Fri 18 Aug 2006, a team of experts from the Entomology working
group has started trapping Culicoides in the affected area, for
virological investigations.
