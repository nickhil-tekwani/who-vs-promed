[After circulating in countries in Asia, H5N8 virus clade 2.3.4.4 group A was introduced into Europe during the winter of 2014-15. During and after the winter of 2016, a related, but genetically distinct, influenza H5N8 virus was detected in Europe; in addition, reassortant influenza H5N5 and H5N6 viruses emerged. Because the influenza season progressed along the fall migratory routes for wild birds from Siberia across Asia into Europe, large numbers of dead wild birds and outbreaks in poultry flocks were associated with H5N8 virus clade 2.3.4.4 group B. Overall, 24 of the 31 European Union countries, neighboring countries, Israel, and countries in the Middle East were facing large avian influenza outbreaks in poultry or wild birds during that period. Since the end of 2019, HPAI H5N8 outbreaks were reported in Europe in poultry, captive birds, and wild birds, and Israel confirmed the infection in a Bonelli's eagle (_Aquila fasciata_) found with neurological symptoms in the Jordan Valley.

The black swan (_Cygnus atratus_) is a large waterbird, a species of swan that breeds mainly in the southeast and southwest regions of Australia. For a picture, go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan#/media/File:Black_Swan_2_-_Pitt_Town_Lagoon.jpg. - Mod.PMB
