NSW Department of Primary Industries (DPI) has advised tick fever has been diagnosed on 2 Mid North Coast properties.

DPI Senior Veterinary Officer Paul Freeman said the outbreak south of Port Macquarie had resulted in more than 60 mortalities on one property and 2 mortalities on the 2nd.

"NSW DPI regulatory officers have identified cattle tick on several properties to date and will be examining cattle herds on adjoining properties to see if cattle tick are present," he said.

"Any herds with cattle tick are subject to a DPI supervised cattle tick eradication program that can take up to 12 months.

"Regulatory officers are tracing the location of any cattle that have been moved off the infested property and are in the process of examining these animals."

Owners of affected properties have been advised not to move any stock on or off the properties, and remaining cattle have been given anti-tick fever treatment.

Cattle ticks are the most serious external parasite of cattle in Australia. They can attach to cattle, horses and other livestock and can transmit tick fever, a potentially fatal disease of cattle.

The tick fever agent is carried in the blood and transmitted by cattle ticks when they feed.

Livestock owners in the area are reminded to remain conscious of farm biosecurity and be on the look-out for cattle ticks.

Signs of affected animals may include fever and depression, anaemia initially followed by staggering and sometimes apparent blindness, hyper excitability and jaundice.

If treated early the chances of recovery are good. Important steps for owners of cattle, horses and other livestock include:

- maintain fencing in good order to prevent livestock from straying

- ensure any livestock brought onto the property are not carrying cattle ticks

- ensure any livestock brought in from Queensland are inspected and treated appropriately

Cattle tick and tick fever are notifiable diseases in NSW which means stockowners are required by law to inform NSW DPI or Local Land Services of any findings on their stock.

[Tick fever is a cattle disease caused by any one of the following blood parasites:
- _Babesia bovis_
- _Babesia bigemina_
- _Anaplasma marginale_

These parasites are all transmitted by the cattle tick (_Boophilus microplus_). Disease caused by _Babesia bovis_ or _Babesia bigeminya_ iis called babesiosis, often referred to as 'red water'. Disease caused by _Anaplasma marginale_ is called anaplasmosis.

_Babesia bovis_ is the most important parasite, causing more than 80 percent of outbreaks of tick fever in Queensland each year.

Clinical signs of tick fever
Signs of tick fever include:
- weakness
- depression
- loss of appetite.
These signs are mainly due to the associated fever and red blood cell destruction (causing anaemia).

Despite the common name 'red water', red urine is only occasionally present and late in the course of the disease. Other clinical signs may include jaundice and neurological signs.

Cattle with _Babesia bovis_ infections may be quite sick even in the absence of anaemia and red urine.

Diagnosing tick fever
It is difficult to diagnose tick fever based on clinical signs alone.

The best way to diagnose tick fever is to send blood smears to a laboratory for examination.

Risk factors for tick fever
Breed
British, European and other _Bos taurus_ cattle breeds are more susceptible to tick fever caused by Babes organisms than Brahman and _Bos indicus_ breeds. Cross breeds (_Bos taurus_ x _Bos indicus_) have intermediate susceptibility determined by the percentage of each breed type.

All breeds, including _Bos indicus_ breeds, are highly susceptible to disease caused by _Anaplasma marginale_.

Age
There is a strong link between age and resistance. Most outbreaks occur in animals 18 to 36 months of age. Calves exposed to tick fever organisms between 3 to 9 months of age rarely show clinical signs and develop a solid, long-lasting immunity.

Exposure
Cattle born and raised in areas where cattle ticks are endemic can develop natural immunity through exposure to ticks infected with tick fever.

However, exposure of calves to ticks infected with tick fever (and subsequent development of protective immunity) can be highly unpredictable. Exposure is influenced by factors such as breed, season and tick-control strategies.

All cattle raised in areas free from cattle ticks are at risk of tick fever if introduced into areas where ticks are present.
