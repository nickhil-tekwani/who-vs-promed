The chikungunya epidemic plaguing the Caribbean has caused the 1st "indirect" death in St Martin, where the beginning of the epidemic was identified as early December 2013, the Guiana Antilles CIRE [(Cellule de l'Institut de Veille Sanitaire aux Antilles-Guyane) Regional Public Health Institute] contact person said on Friday [17 Jan 2014].

This death is "indirectly related to chikungunya, mainly due to existing co-morbidities" in this patient hospitalized for a severe form of the disease, says WAX Guiana Antilles, in its latest epidemiological assessment. CIRE and the prefecture indicated in a statement that the person was "an 81 year old man who had other diseases." This person was one of 2 patients hospitalized in St Martin for a severe form of the disease.

Of the 340 cases suggestive of chikungunya reported in Martinique as of 16 Jan [2014], 2/3rds occurred only in the 2nd week [of January 2014]. And the number confirmed or considered probable is already 127, with 12 cities of the island being affected.

In Guiana, only one biologically confirmed case, imported from Martinique, has been identified to date. But the territory is still awaiting the results of tests of 7 suspected cases.

[No information was provided in the report above that establishes chikungunya virus infection as a contributing factor to the elderly man's death. Because the fatality rate for chikungunya virus infections is extremely low to nil in these outbreaks, ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving further details about this case.

The 7 cases under investigation in Guiana are of concern. If they turn out to be locally acquired chikungunya virus infections, it will add to a mainland locality where the virus is being transmitted.
