A district of the western Mongolian province of Bayan-Olgiy has been quarantined after 2 people died of suspected bubonic plague, local media reported Wed 1 May 2019. A couple died in suspicious circumstances in Ulgii district of the western province in late April 2019, news website <gogo.mn> quoted the province's emergency management department as saying.

"Preliminary test results show that bubonic plague likely caused the deaths of the 2 people. The province's office has declared an indefinite quarantine in Ulgii soum," the department said in a statement, adding that further investigation of the case is still underway.

Plague is a bacterial disease that is spread by fleas living on wild rodents such as marmots. The disease can kill an adult in fewer than 24 hours if not treated in time, according to the WHO.

[Plague is caused by _Yersinia pestis_.

Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a "bubo." Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, as appears to have happened in the report above, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of "primary" plague pneumonia.

Plague is endemic in Mongolia. Marmots such as the Tarvaga, the Tarbagan or Mongolian marmot, _Marmota sibirica_, a large rodent related to the American woodchuck (_M. monax_), are thought to be significant zoonotic reservoirs for _Y. pestis_ in Eastern Asia. The name marmot (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmot) comes from French marmotte, from Latin _mures monti_ "mountain mouse."
