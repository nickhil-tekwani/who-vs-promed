South Dakota Department of Health officials say the number of syphilis cases reported in the state last year [2013] was the most in 44 years. State epidemiologist Lon Kightlinger labeled as "very disheartening" an annual summary of infectious diseases in South Dakota showing that 48 syphilis cases were reported in 2013.

"Through most of the 1990s and the 2000s, we didn't have any or one or 2 cases in a year," Kightlinger told the Sioux Falls Argus Leader (http://argusne.ws/1mkcf2O).

The most reports of the sexually transmitted disease were in the Sioux Falls area, the largest population area in the state, with 23 cases, and Corson County, where the Standing Rock Reservation is located. Standing Rock reported 14 cases.

The Sioux Falls cases involve mostly men, and the Corson County cases both men and women. Kightlinger said people coming to Sioux Falls and having anonymous sex are largely responsible for the spread of the disease in the state, and Corson County represents the disease going through a specific population.

"Somebody goes someplace, gets syphilis and brings it home," he said. "They're having sex with somebody at home, and it's not recognized right away. That person has sex. It's like a spider web." The Standing Rock Reservation straddles North and South Dakota.

Kightlinger said health officials are particularly worried about the syphilis increase because unlike some other diseases where outbreaks can be controlled by eliminating specific sources of contamination, "there's so much personal choice involved." Left untreated, the disease can affect the liver, nervous system, and brain, and it can be transmitted by pregnant women to their fetuses. Sioux Falls public health officials said they would be looking at grant funding to deal with disease outbreak prevention.

"If we know a disease is in the community, it provides us an opportunity to drive an education program," Sioux Falls public health manager Sandy Frentz said. "It's part of the picture of overall community health. How can we impact community health through prevention and education?"

[Sioux Falls is the largest city in the US state of South Dakota and is the county seat of Minnehaha County (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux_Falls,_South_Dakota). Its population of 237 251 accounts for 29 percent of South Dakota's population. Sioux Falls is the 47th fastest growing city in the US, with low unemployment (3.5 percent) and multiple thriving businesses that have been attracting between 3000 and 4000 people each year (http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/07/americas-next-boom-town-sioux-falls-south-dakota/277579/).

The Standing Rock Reservation is a Lakota, Yanktonai, and Dakota Indian reservation (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Rock_Indian_Reservation). The entire Corson County, South Dakota, lies within the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. The county has a population of a little over 4000 residents, with about 61 percent American Indian (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corson_County,_South_Dakota#Communities). A county map of South Dakota can be found at http://geology.com/county-map/south-dakota.shtml.

In 2000, the number of cases and the incidence rate in the US of primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis, the contagious stages of syphilis, were 5979 and 2.1 per 100 000, respectively, the lowest since reporting began in 1941 (Table 1, http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/tables/1.htm). Since that time the number of cases and incidence rate of P&S syphilis increased almost yearly to 13 970 and 4.5 in 2011 (Table 1, http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/tables/1.htm). The southern region of the US accounted for 44.1 percent of P&S cases in 2011 (Table 26, http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/tables/26.htm). In recent years, young men who have sex with men (MSM) have accounted for an increasing number of P&S syphilis cases in the United States; in 2011, 72 percent of P&S syphilis cases were among MSM (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/syphilis.htm).

Although the news report does not specify which stages of syphilis they are referring to, it is likely they are referring to P&S syphilis. South Dakota reported 7 cases of P&S syphilis in 2007, 1 case in 2008, 0 cases in 2009, 4 cases in 2010, and 0 cases in 2011, with rates that range from 0.0 to 0.9 per 100 000 population, while the rates for the US as a whole range from 3.8 to 4.6 for the years 2007-2011 (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/tables/26.htm).

However, in 2012, South Dakota ranked 36 among 50 states reporting at least one case of P&S syphilis with a rate of 2.2 cases per 100 000 population, compared to the US rate of 5.0; in fact, 18 cases of P&S syphilis were reported in South Dakota; but no cases occurred among American Indians in 2012 (http://www.cdc.gov/std/Syphilis2012/Syphilis-2012-All-Profiles.pdf). According to the news report above, the trend continued in 2013 with a jump in the number of cases to 48; 23 of the cases occurred in Sioux Falls and 14 of the cases occurred in Corson County, presumably mostly among American Indians in the Standing Rock Reservation, although the news report does not specify the racial identity of the cases. A more detailed description of the cases would be appreciated. - Mod.ML
