In its weekly pandemic snapshot yesterday [Tue 13 Jul 2021], the WHO said COVID-19 deaths are increasing again after falling for 9 weeks, with the sharpest upticks in Africa and Southeast Asia.

Deaths are often a lagging COVID-19 marker, and global illnesses last week jumped 10% over the previous week, marking the 4th consecutive weekly rise. With no end in sight to the world's latest COVID-19 surge, several countries from diverse regions today reported new daily highs for cases.

Cases rose in all world regions except for the Americas, the WHO said in its situation report. Much of the increase is led by the more transmissible delta (1617.2) variant, which was detected in 15 more countries last week, lifting the total to 111. [https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/weekly-epidemiological-update-on-covid-19---13-july-2021]

The 5 countries that reported the most cases last week are Brazil, India, Indonesia, the United Kingdom, and Colombia. Some of the nations that reported the steepest rises last week include Zimbabwe (up 72%), Tunisia (47%), Indonesia (44%), the United States (38%), Iran (38%), Bangladesh (35%), the United Kingdom (30%), Iraq (29%), Malaysia (24%), and Japan (22%).

At a briefing today [Wed 14 Jul 2021] with officials from the WHO's Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), its director, Carissa Etienne, MBBS, said though cases declined overall in the Americas region last week, several countries--including the United States--are experiencing resurgences. She said that cases are climbing again in Argentina and are reaching record highs in Colombia, where intensive care unit (ICU) capacity is at 98%, raising concerns about the health system's ability to cope. [https://mailchi.mp/paho/briefingjulyseven-747044?e=f9be0c3361]

Etienne said that unrest in countries such as Colombia, Brazil, and now Cuba is partly fueled by impacts of the pandemic.

She urged countries to continue donating vaccine, noting that countries vary widely in their coverage, ranging from less than 1% in Guatemala and Honduras to nearly half of the population in countries such as Chile, Uruguay, the United States, and Canada. Etienne also pressed countries to step up their surveillance, especially when vaccine coverage is low.

Just days after topping 40 000 daily cases, Indonesia's surge continued to accelerate, jumping to 54 517 cases. The country's health minister said the delta variant has been found in 11 areas outside the more urban Java island, stoking concerns about health capacities in the less populated areas, according to Reuters. [https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/concern-grows-over-indonesias-regions-delta-variant-ravages-java-2021-07-14/]

Other Asian countries reporting new record daily highs include Myanmar, Malaysia, and Vietnam. Also, South Korea's cases reached a new record high, as health officials expanded distancing measures from the Seoul area to most parts of the country, according to Reuters. [https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/skorea-reports-record-high-1615-new-covid-19-daily-cases-kdca-2021-07-14/]

In Japan, the city of Tokyo, where the Olympics begin in about a week, reported a new daily high of 1149 cases, passing the peak of its 4th wave, according to Asahi Shimbun, a newspaper based in Japan. [https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14395062]

Elsewhere, Iraq reported a new daily record high of 9635 cases, and Russia today [Wed 14 Jul 2021] reported a record 786 deaths, along with 23 827 more cases.

In Singapore, the detection of a COVID-19 case on a cruise prompted 3000 passengers and crew members to be confined to their rooms before the ship docked today, allowing people to begin leaving, according to Reuters. The person who tested positive is a close contact of someone on land who contracted the virus. [https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/singapore-tourism-board-says-cruise-ship-returns-after-suspected-covid-19-case-2021-07-14/]

The WHO's emergency committee on COVID-19 is meeting today for the 8th time to discuss the latest developments. The group meets every 3 months, or more often as needed. They are likely to say the situation still warrants a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) and may tweak some of their health recommendations.

The European Medicines Agency [EMA] and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [ECDC] today weighed in on the use of vaccines, emphasizing the importance of completing recommended dose sources as countries face rising delta variant surges. Regarding "mix and match" strategies, the groups said there are not enough data to make a clear recommendation, though early signals from a few countries suggest a satisfactory immune response and no safety concerns. They also said it's too early to confirm if and when booster doses may be needed.

The global total today rose to 187 802 240 cases, along with at least 4 048 653 deaths, according to the New York Times tracker. [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/world/covid-cases.html]

[B] Cases spike

Social-distancing rules were tightened in Bangkok, Seoul, and parts of Vietnam as the more easily transmitted delta variant of COVID-19 continues to spread. Tokyo entered its 4th state of emergency and Sydney had a 45% spike in daily cases. In the U.S., which still leads the world in total infections and deaths, there was another bad sign as confirmed cases soared 47% in one week, the largest such rise since April 2020. The increase has been mostly in Republican-leaning states, where Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease specialist, said "ideological rigidity" is stopping people from getting shots.

But Democratic strongholds aren't being spared: In New York City, where tens of thousands died during the 1st wave of the pandemic, infection rates are rising, too. (Pfizer said it was to meet [Mon 12 Jul 2021] with U.S. officials to discuss a booster version of its vaccine). In Europe, Greece is mandating shots for those who work in senior citizen homes, healthcare, and the military. But in the U.K., Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to end all precautions just as infections there are spiking.

[A CDC study "provides strong evidence that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections in real-world conditions among health care personnel, first responders, and other essential workers. These groups are more likely than the general population to be exposed to the virus because of their occupations.

The study looked at the effectiveness of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections among 3950 study participants in 6 states over a 13-week period from 14 Dec 2020 - 13 Mar 2021.

Results showed that following the 2nd dose of vaccine (the recommended number of doses), risk of infection was reduced by 90% 2 or more weeks after vaccination. Following a single dose of either vaccine, the participants' risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 was reduced by 80% 2 or more weeks after vaccination. ..." (from https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/p0329-COVID-19-Vaccines.html)

The mRNA-based vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna may not be quite as effective at reducing transmission of the delta variant, which has a mutation in the "spike protein" ...but the available data from multiple nations finds that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are 96% effective in preventing COVID hospitalizations and deaths from delta variant infections, according to Dr. Eric Topol. (from https://fortune.com/2021/07/14/covid-delta-variant-best-vaccine-most-effective-against-variants/)

A booster dose may not be highly effective in lowering case numbers since vaccinated individuals who become infected are not likely to further disseminate the virus and generally but with some exceptions, symptoms are mild if recognized at all. It would be helpful to analyze the data to determine if the new cases are in unvaccinated non-immune individuals or breakthrough cases. Most likely it is the former, emphasizing the need to vaccinate those who have missed the opportunity to date. See [3] below. - Mod.LK]

[2] Resource scarce hospitals

Small things can save lives: coping with COVID-19 in resource-scarce hospitals

"We saw patients dying for avoidable reasons. They were dying because masks that came loose were not being replaced," says MSF COVID-19 intervention nursing activities manager, Caroline Masunda.

Everywhere, patients have died from COVID-19 when patient numbers exceeded the capacity of the health system. The number of doctors, nurses, and oxygen points just wasn't enough.

People died from a lack of oxygen because no one noticed that their oxygen mask wasn't well positioned or that their oxygen saturation was dropping. They died of dehydration or kidney failure because they didn't receive enough water. They died because there weren't enough staff, or because new staff added in an emergency were inexperienced and poorly organised.

There are a number of things every hospital can do to prevent unnecessary deaths when the system is overloaded.

COVID-19 has exacerbated the global shortage of health workers, already estimated to be over 7 million before the pandemic. Where there are not enough doctors and nurses to deliver medical care, one solution is to move certain tasks to less specialized health workers, a process called task-shifting.

There is extensive public health experience with task-shifting and substantial evidence that this can reduce costs and improve efficiency in the areas of HIV, tuberculosis (TB), and other diseases.

In January 2021, during the peak of the second wave of COVID-19 in South Africa, I coordinated a support intervention of Doctors Without Borders in a large hospital in the country's KwaZulu-Natal province. Hospital staff were so overwhelmed that many patients died because of lack of the basics: oxygen, water, and basic patient monitoring and support. Colleagues supporting interventions in other resource-limited settings reported similar experiences.

When there is a shortage of nurses, such as in the COVID-19 pandemic, task-shifting of basic care to less specialized cadres such as caregivers, nursing auxiliaries or community health workers can prevent unnecessary deaths. Hiring lower level workers and staff to manage them can be life-saving.

Precedents
Distribution of antiretroviral therapy has been successfully shifted from doctors to nurses, to lay counsellors or peer educators, and even to patients in the community.

In Mozambique, task-shifting of tuberculosis logistic management services to hospital auxiliary workers reduced delays to tuberculosis treatment initiation and hospital mortality. In another study, triage by lay staff reduced child deaths in the emergency department of a rural hospital.

And there are examples of family members partially taking over some basic tasks in resource-limited hospitals. Research in Kenya has shown that to cope with difficult work conditions nurses delegate tasks to family and support staff. But family members aren't allowed into COVID-19 wards and these tasks have fallen back to nurses.

Task-shifting can and should be used in COVID-19 wards
Nursing assistants or caregivers can provide basic care and patient support. Volunteers or lay staff can be hired to function as runners and porters, and communicate with families. This leaves time for nurses to focus on more medical tasks.

In KwaZulu-Natal and in Lesotho, Doctors Without Borders hired enrolled nurses to monitor oxygen saturation, and lay caregivers or ward attendants to ensure oxygen masks and nasal prongs were in place, and help with proning, hydration, bedpans, feeding, and mobilization of patients. In addition, doctor and nurse activity managers ensured management, coordination, and training. This led to rapid improvements in patient care.

What needs to be done
Where resources are limited, basic care and oxygen delivery save more lives than intensive care. Yet the basics are often neglected. To prepare for future waves of COVID-19, hospitals need to plan for sufficient oxygen delivery, be prepared to hire sufficient basic health staff, and organise task-shifting of basic care and support.

Emergency responses require a great deal of coordination. Attention is needed to ensure adequate managerial staff are added to coordinate teams of sometimes inexperienced or new staff to work coherently. For example, in Ngwelezana hospital in South Africa, addition of a nursing activity manager was essential to improve organization and quality of care in the ward. Special attention should also be given to the night shift. Most patients die at night. Ensuring increased attention to and sufficient staff for patient monitoring and support at night can save lives.

Then there's the provision of basic materials such as water bottles, cups, straws, pillows for proning (which can increase oxygen saturation by up to 10%), and bedpans. Availability of these items in sufficient quantities can also make the difference between life and death.

Healthcare workers have learned many things from the fight against epidemics such as HIV and Ebola in Africa over the past 20 years. When doctors and nurses were overwhelmed, innovative ways of task-shifting allowed them to efficiently provide quality care to high numbers of patients.

Small things can prevent unnecessary deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic, even in the poorest countries with the weakest health systems. Investing in sufficient oxygen capacity and basic care by hiring entry level health staff may save more lives than ventilators and high care.

[Tulio de Oliveira: In times of trouble, it is important to support health care workers as missing a nurse in a night shift can cause unnecessary deaths. "We saw patients dying for avoidable reasons. They were dying and because masks that came loose were not being replaced" (Medecins Sans Frontieres)]

[There will certainly be a next outbreak. It will be important to apply the lessons learned from HIV, Ebola, SARS-CoV-2 to the next outbreak and pass on the knowledge to the next generation of health care workers so the same mistakes are not repeated and the new understanding of how best to manage these outbreaks is retained. - Mod.LK]

States with low vaccination numbers had COVID-19 case rates last week 3 times higher than others where people are fully vaccinated

When you compare states with high vaccination rates to states that are lagging, the difference in the number of people getting COVID-19 is staggering.

Over the past week, states that have fully vaccinated more than half of their residents have reported an average COVID-19 case rate that is about 1/3 of that in states which have fully vaccinated less than half of their residents, according to a CNN analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC].

Alabama, Mississippi and, Arkansas are the only states to have fully vaccinated fewer than 35% of their residents. Average daily case rates in each state were among the 10 worst in the country last week. Vermont leads the nation with about 66% of its population fully vaccinated -- and while case rates there increased compared to last week, the state still had the lowest case rate in the country last week, with an average of less than one new case per 100 000 people each day.

States that have fully vaccinated more than half of their residents reported an average of 2.8 new Covid-19 cases per 100 000 people each day last week, compared to an average of about 7.8 cases per 100 000 people each day in states that have vaccinated less than half of their residents.

"We really need to get more people vaccinated, because that's the solution," Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [NIAID], said Monday [12 Jul 2021] on "CBS This Morning." "This virus will, in fact, be protected against by the vaccine."

Across the country, more than 99% of US COVID-19 deaths in June [2021] were among unvaccinated people, said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the US CDC.

Dr. Howard Jarvis, an emergency medicine physician in Springfield, Missouri, told CNN on Monday that his sick patients are all unvaccinated. "If they're sick enough to be admitted to the hospital, they are unvaccinated. That is the absolute common denominator amongst those patients," he said. "I can see the regret on their face. You know, we ask them, because we want to know, are you vaccinated? And it's very clear that a lot of them regret (not being vaccinated)."

The pace of vaccinations has dropped sharply in recent months. About 246 000 people initiated vaccination each day over the past week, down 88% from the April [2021] peak, and about 278 000 people became fully vaccinated each day over the past week, down 84% from the April [2021] peak, CDC data shows. About 56.2% of Americans 12 or older are fully vaccinated.

[4] Israel: breakthrough infections

ProMED-ESP Digest article title translations - Vol 55, Issue 156 - Tue 14 Jul 2021
https://www.euroweeklynews.com/2021/07/13/over-40-of-infections-in-israel-occur-in-people-who-are-fully-vaccinated/


Over 40% of new infections in Israel occur in people who are fully vaccinated. Data from the Israeli Ministry of Health have revealed a correlation between patients infected with the delta variant of COVID-19 and people who were vaccinated in the 1st place, around the month of January [2021], which could have its origin in a decrease in vaccine effectiveness from 6 months after inoculation.

The former director-general of health in Israel has publicly assured that between 40% and 50% of the new infections detected occurred in people who were fully vaccinated, as reported by 20 Minutos. Experts from the Ministry itself have warned, however, that it is still too early to draw conclusions due to the small sample and also emphasize that most of the people vaccinated in the first place were of advanced age and that therefore they had a weaker immune system. However, this phenomenon was completely predictable and, in fact, confirms the ability of vaccines to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection, and especially against severe forms of COVID-19.

Currently available vaccines, effective as they are in preventing serious forms of COVID-19 including hospitalizations and death, cannot protect 100% of those vaccinated against the infection. A large study of the Israeli population, conducted from late January 2021 to early April and published in The Lancet, estimated the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at 95.3% against the risk of infection for fully vaccinated people. This means that just under 5% of those vaccinated may still be infected with SARS-CoV-2. The figure could even rise in the case of the delta variant, which is believed to be more contagious than the alpha variant, which was dominant at the time of the study.
