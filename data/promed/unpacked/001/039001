Poliovirus has been detected in Delhi's sewage triggering fears that
the disease might spread. Sources said the detection was made during
a sewage surveillance programme conducted between April and June this
year [2010] in east Delhi areas. The samples have been sent to the
World Health Organization (WHO) for further study.

Delhi is among the high risk zones for prevalence of polio because of
influx of migrant population. Health officials said the new
surveillance programme is aimed at identifying and tracking the wild
poliovirus in the environment. Dr CM Khanijo, in charge of the polio
[department] of the Delhi government, said: "Polio spreads through
the faecal-oral route and can be found in faecal particles present in
sewage. So, even when no human cases are reported, sampling from the
environment can alert health authorities." He added that sewage
surveillance has been intensified in the capital following detection
of wild poliovirus in 2 major drains between the months of April and
June [2010] -- near the Red Cross Hospital in Seemapuri and Swarn
Cinema in the Trans-Yamuna area.

At present, sewage surveillance programme is being conducted in 5
areas along the Yamuna [river] -- including Batla House, Wazirpur,
and Bhalaswa Lake. Khanijo said during surveillance in August and
September [2010], no virus was found. "We are waiting for sewage
surveillance reports for October and November [2010], following which
a roadmap for tracking the virus will be planned and executed. WHO
officials and authorities are helping us in the endeavour to
eradicate polio," he added.

Dr Bir Singh, professor of community medicine at AIIMS [All India
Institute of Medical Sciences], said detection of poliovirus in
sewage indicated that the virus had not been eradicated completely,
and it could be a potential source of infection to those who have not
been immunized.

Delhi has not reported any human case this year [2010]. In 2009, 4
polio cases were reported. Health officials said that more than one
lakh [100 000] people migrate to the city every day and most of the
viruses are carried by them. The drains in east Delhi where
poliovirus was found recently are connected to Ghaziabad in Uttar
Pradesh.

"In Delhi, the immunization programme is conducted every 6 weeks.
Those living in JJ clusters [Jhuggi Jhopari clusters are squatter
settlements (slums), mostly on government land - Mod.CP] are at a
high risk and so we have introduced house-to-house scheme where
health workers approach the families and vaccinate children," said
Delhi health minister, Kiran Walia. The [most recent] polio drive was
on 19 Nov 2010.

[According to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative website
<http://www.polioeradication.org/InfectedCountries/India.aspx>) most
of India is polio-free. Persistent transmission of poliovirus is
localized in areas of western Uttar Pradesh and central Bihar in the
north of the country. Since 2005, poliovirus has been exported from
India to the bordering countries of Nepal, Bangladesh, and Myanmar,
as well as to Angola in Africa. In 2009, new data demonstrated that
very high population immunity (greater than 95 percent) could be
achieved in India using monovalent oral polio vaccine and very high
immunization coverage.

India has reported 40 cases in 2010 (17 cases of wild poliovirus type
1 and 23 cases of wild poliovirus type 3). The most recent case, a
wild poliovirus type 1 case, in Murshidibad, West Bengal, had onset
of paralysis on 21 Sep 2010. Key strategic reviews are ongoing in
India this month (December 2010), to further refine operational
approaches for 2011, including for targeted communications and social
mobilization and AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) surveillance. 78.8
million children were immunised from 14 Nov 2010 across Uttar
Pradesh, Bihar, and high-risk areas of other states. An additional
mop-up round is proposed from 19 Dec 2010 in Delhi, parts of West
Bengal and core transmission areas of Bihar.

[The level of effort of the polio eradication initiative in India is
impressive. Through the environmental monitoring, they have been able
to document that in the absence of identified clinical cases of
paralytic poliomyelitis in Delhi there is still periodic presence of
the wild poliovirus (WPV) most likely related to the high levels of
migratory population movement through the capital city. This
environmental monitoring has provided the impetus to sustain high
levels of vaccine activities in spite of an apparent interruption of
transmission of the WPV. Subscribers should be reminded of the recent
polio case identified in the north of Uganda where the WPV identified
was genetically similar to a WPV that had been circulating in Kenya a
year earlier (see Poliomyelitis - worldwide (23): Uganda
20101027.3900). - Mod.MPP]
