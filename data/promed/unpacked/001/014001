Man dies of rat-borne disease
---------------------------
Health workers will carry out a rat eradication program following the death
of a man from leptospirosis, a rodent-borne disease. The areas covered by
the program include Charles Street, La Romaine, where the 33-year-old
[male] lived.
He died from the disease, which is mainly spread by rats, Thu night, 15 Apr
2004 at the San Fernando General Hospital, where he was being treated for
the past week, his sister told the Express.
A self-employed transport contractor who dealt mainly in transporting
chicken for several small poultry farms in south Oropouche and Fyzabad is
2004's 1st known victim of the disease.
Imtiaz Ahamad, chairman of the South-West Regional Health Authority, said
he had instructed his technical officers to carry out the necessary
preventative measures to get rid of rats in the area in which the man had
lived.
Ahamad said the SWRHA would be embarking on a special program to ensure
that all farms in the area have adequate safeguards to prevent rodents from
entering the section in which chicken feed is stored.
Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that can be spread to humans through
the urine of infected rodents. Infected dogs and other mammals also
transmit the disease. Symptoms can include high fever, severe headaches,
chills, muscle aches and vomiting.
For 2002, there were 120 reported cases of leptospirosis; in 2003, there
were 131 cases.

[Most cases of leptospirosis, usually transmitted to man after contact with
water contaminated with the urine of infected rodents, are mild and
self-limited even without specific therapy. Severe disease, however, with
hepatic and renal insufficiency can occur (so-called Weils' disease), which
is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The method of
diagnosis and whether any therapy was given in this case are not stated. -
