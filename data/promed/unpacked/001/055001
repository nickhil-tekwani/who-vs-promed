The best wet season in a decade has also seen a spike in cases of the rare disease leptospirosis among cattle workers in the Top End.

There have already been 9 cases confirmed in the Northern Territory [NT], which has prompted the issuing of a health warning.

Leptospirosis can be a fatal disease, which passes to humans chiefly through animal urine and cases have risen after the return of a better La Nina-inspired wet season across the Territory. It can be successfully treated with antibiotics; there is no vaccine [for humans].

Melioidosis, or gardeners disease, is another risk to northern Australian residents who come into contact with soil disease from sodden ground.

NT's Centre for Disease Control public health registrar Dr Damien Brown said there had already been 9 cases of leptospirosis confirmed among cattle workers since January [2021]. Most of the new cases have been linked to workers in the Daly River and rural Darwin region, with 2 cases confirmed in Pine Creek. There were only 4 cases confirmed in the Top End last year [2020] during a generally poor wet season.

"Leptospirosis is known to affect cattle and farm workers, and is particularly common after heavy rains," Dr Brown said. "Anyone with a fever, muscle aches, and headache -- especially in the absence of cold-like symptoms like a runny nose -- is urged to see a doctor for further assessment and testing. The disease is easily treated with oral antibiotics if caught early, but left untreated can progress to a severe and sometimes fatal illness." Dr Brown said the disease poses most risk to people working on stations closely with animals or in abattoirs.

However, contaminated water, mud, and soil can also be a risk. People camping, hunting, and gardening should take precautions, Dr Brown said.

Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection caused by the bacteria _Leptospira_. It occurs in both humans and animals, mainly in tropical areas like the NT and north Queensland. "The illness is caused by a bacterium that is found in animals such as pigs, cattle, rats, dogs, and possums, and spread by their infected urine," Dr Brown said. "Humans become infected when we come into contact with contaminated water, wet soil, or animals or their tissue -- hence the other names 'cane cutter's fever' and 'mud fever'. The bacteria usually enter through cuts or grazes, or splashes to the eye or contact with the inside of the mouth."

Symptoms -- sudden fever with headaches, chills, severe muscle pain (particularly in the legs), and reddened eyes -- typically occur after about 10 days and last around 3 weeks. "Cough, diarrhoea, and vomiting can also occur and some people go on to develop more severe disease including jaundice (yellow skin or eyes), bleeding, breathing difficulties, and confusion, and in rare cases, this can be fatal," Dr Brown said.

[The news article above reports an increase in cases of leptospirosis occurring in cattle workers in Daly River and Pine Creek (small towns in the Katherine region) and in the Darwin region of the Top End, the northern-most portion of Australia's Northern Territory (NT). NT is located between the states of Western Australia to the west and Queensland to the east (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory). Its capital is Darwin. A map of NT showing the location of the 5 NT regions can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barkly_Tableland#/media/File:Alice_Springs_region.jpg.

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that is distributed throughout the world in warm climates and frequently follows flooding after heavy rains. Leptospirosis is caused by exposure to _Leptospira_ bacteria, in fresh (not salty) water, wet soil, or vegetation that has been contaminated by urine of usually asymptomatic, but chronically infected animals, with one of the several hundred serovars of the spirochete _Leptospira_ spp. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions and are associated with one or more maintenance hosts. Rodents, dogs, cattle, and pigs are maintenance hosts that serve as reservoirs for this organism. _Leptospira_ spp. serovar Hardjo causes disease in cattle and humans throughout the world (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC130359). Serovar Hardjo is split into 2 species: _L. borgpetersenii_ serovar Hardjo, which is found worldwide, and the less frequent _L. interrogans_ serovar Hardjo (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0159387).

Leptospirosis is an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors or with animals; for example, workers in wet agricultural settings (such as rice field workers), ranchers, slaughterhouse workers, trappers, loggers, sewer workers, veterinarians, fishery workers, dairy farmers, or military personnel. Also, leptospirosis is a risk during recreational activities, such as camping, fresh water swimming, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, golfing, and trail biking, that involve exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or ponds contaminated by urine from leptospire-infected animals, as well as a risk from household exposure to infected pet animals or rodents.

Most patients with leptospirosis have a non-specific mild, flu-like illness. Some patients develop severe disease with myocardial, pulmonary, renal, or hepatic involvement. Multi-organ failure, thrombocytopenia, and bleeding may develop. Severe infection may be fatal in 5-40 per cent of cases.

Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of leptospirosis, its diagnosis cannot be made with confidence without laboratory confirmation. The _Leptospira_ Dip-S-Tick (DST) IgM dot-ELISA test kits (PanBio Integrated Diagnostics) can provide in-the-field testing of suspected patients (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC149700/). Confirmatory testing uses the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Molecular assays such as DNA PCR can also be used, if available.

Leptospirosis is usually treated with penicillin or ceftriaxone intravenously for severe disease and doxycycline or amoxicillin for milder disease. Antibiotic treatment is most efficacious when started early in the course of the disease (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12870063/). Doxycycline (200 mg orally, once weekly) has been shown to be effective for short-term prophylaxis in high-risk environments
(https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM198402233100805).

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease, affecting many animal species. In farm animals (cattle and pigs) it may cause considerable economic losses. _Leptospira borgpetersenii_ serovar Hardjo and _L. interrogans_ serovar Pomona have been shown to be the most important pathogenic serovars in cattle, responsible for systemic illness, abortion, neonatal death, weak calves, and various production losses throughout the world. In Australia, a range of serovars have been identified, including _L._ Hardjo, Tarassovi, Pomona, and Szwajizak. The disease is controlled mainly by vaccination.

Leptospirosis is not included in OIE's list of reportable diseases. - Mod.AS]
