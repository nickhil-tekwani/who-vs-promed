You have had one sensible email about this dog, asking how valid is
the antibody test that has come up positive.

Serology testing in humans is notoriously unreliable, with low
specificity and sensitivity, and cross-reactions very real and
everyday occurrences.

Without knowing how long this test has been available, and how well
validated it has been with known positive and negative serum samples
(of which there can't be many positives), it is impossible to say what
this result means.

I have spent more than 30 years in human pathology, and the
interpretation of serology results is extremely difficult.

It would be very sad indeed to have this well and fit dog euthanised
on the basis of one possibly dodgy serology result.

The more critical results are the antigen results on the dog's saliva
(presumably by PCR or NAAT [nucleic acid amplification tests]?) which
are far more sensitive (and hopefully more specific) and a real
indication of infectivity.

The situation in regards to the dog with Hendra virus infection is
fascinating and highlights problems relating to the absolute
sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of diagnostic
assays for zoonotic infectious disease. I appreciated the most recent
posting, including the message from David Thompson, that highlighted
issues relating to the humanity of euthanizing this dog or using the
dog for research purposes.

The popular media reports that describe the situation have too often
been misleading, because by saying the dog "tested positive for Hendra
virus" without further qualification of the nature and meaning of the
tests performed, they have implied that the dog was actively infected
with the virus and is therefore a real public health risk. It was
stated all too hastily in initial reports in the public media that the
recommendations were to euthanize the dog. Further consideration and
discussion is required in regards to the humanity of euthanizing an
apparently healthy dog that is someone's loved pet on the basis of a
single positive antibody test.

In my opinion, quarantine at this time and repeated investigation of
this dog's true antibody status and the possibility of virus shedding
seem like a more appropriate road to take.

[The question of test validation and sensitivity is a huge issue.
Furthermore, ProMED-mail reported yesterday (27 Jul 2011, archive no 20110727.2257) on information from 1994 indicating that dogs did not
shed virus and were not at risk of shedding virus.

How exceptionally sad that fear rules the day and the regulatory
authorities are so consumed by fear that they refuse to look at the
science already done. Then they think that taking millions of dollars
to solve a problem is great. Why not look at what has already been
done?

Why not learn from the animal? Study his behaviour, develop accurate
test, and determine if he can pass the virus to ferrets who are
apparently quite sensitive. Why put him in a different quarantine
site? The entire premises is already quarantined. So many questions,
and better alternatives than euthanasia.

We hope the regulatory authorities will listen to the previous
research and exercise some intelligent discretion, not just fear.
Until there is new information, we appreciate your comments but will
hold on posting until there is new information. - Mod.TG]

Current situation
-----------------
A 5th horse has died from Hendra virus on a property near Mullumbimby,
on the New South Wales North Coast.

The property has been quarantined and movement restrictions are in
place for all horses and domestic animals, including dogs and cats.

There are 8 other horses on the quarantined property. One is showing
signs of illness but has been initially tested negative for Hendra.
The others are currently showing no signs of illness.

There are 3 cats and 2 dogs on the property -- all will be assessed in
line with NSW DPI's [Department of Primary Industries] policy for
companion animals.

The Mullumbimby area property is the 4th in NSW affected by Hendra
virus after properties at Wollongbar, Macksville, and Lismore were
quarantined earlier in the month [July 2011].

Hendra in NSW snapshot (since 30 Jun 2011):
- 4 properties have been confirmed positive for the Hendra virus
- 87 properties have been confirmed as negative for the Hendra virus,
with further confirmatory antibody testing still underway on some
properties
- Awaiting results for 2 samples.

Hendra virus and companion animals
----------------------------------
NSW DPI's policy is to routinely test all companion animals that are
assessed as having had or been likely to have had close contact with
an infected horse.

All animals at infected NSW properties have been assessed as being low
risk.

[It seems that the issue of dogs and cats is going to continue. In
light of that one hopes the regulatory officials will come to their
senses and stop acting out of fear when there is evidence that dogs do
not shed the virus, but appear only to seroconvert.

Let us hope that the individuals are safe and their tests come back
negative for the virus. - Mod.TG]
