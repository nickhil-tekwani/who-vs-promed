Melons have been linked to a _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Braenderup outbreak that has affected 200 people in more than 10 countries.

Patients have been reported in Denmark, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Canada and Switzerland. Illnesses started in late March 2021. Czech Republic and Spain have also recorded recent _Salmonella_ Braenderup infections but it is not yet clear if they belong to this outbreak.

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) report that the source is thought to be whole honeydew, cantaloupe and galia melons from Costa Rica, Honduras or Brazil. Most UK retailers are believed to have stocked the affected melons bought on or before [28 May 2021] but they have now been removed from sale. In the UK, 52 people fell sick between [29 Mar 2021] and [28 Apr 2021]. In total, 33 females and 19 males aged 0 to 88 years old have been affected. Public Health England, Food Standards Scotland and other UK health protection and food safety agencies are part of the ongoing investigation. One 53 year old male is ill in Canada with symptom onset of [8 Mar 2021]. He has no history of travel.

Consumers can identify the country of origin from a sticker on the fruit. If people are not sure about where the galia, cantaloupe or honeydew melon came from they are advised not to eat it. Tina Potter, head of incidents for the Food Standards Agency, said: "As a precaution we are advising people not to eat these melons and to dispose of them. It is important that consumers wash their hands and any surfaces that have been in contact with the melons thoroughly. This will help avoid the risk of cross contamination and the risk of illness."

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is supporting an international outbreak investigation. "This is a rapidly evolving international outbreak with more than 200 cases of _Salmonella_ Braenderup. There is a predominance of women among the cases. Given the extent of cases within but also outside of the EU, it is likely to be a food item with a wide geographical distribution." The International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) has been following the multinational outbreak since [10 May 2021].

Denmark identified 27 people with _S._ Braenderup infections between [26 Mar 2021 and 28 Apr 2021. 19 are female and 8 male, ranging from 1 to 90 years of age. They are geographically spread and have not traveled outside the country. Norway had 5 cases between [13 and 26 Apr 2021] in a nursing home: 4 are female aged from 77 to 93 years old and 3 are a confirmed match with the outbreak strain. Sweden has 36 patients between [4 Apr 2021] and [15 May 2021] with 29 females and 7 males aged 0 to 95 years old.

Belgium has 42 infections with 4 confirmed between [23 Mar 2021] and [5 May 2021]: 30 are female with cases ranging from 1 to 97 years old. 13 patients live in the Netherlands. 6 are female, 3 are male with an age range of 4 to 84 years old. 5 people are sick in Finland with 3 confirmed between [13 Apr 2021] and [2 May 2021]. 3 are females and 2 are males aged 44 to 75 years old. 1 man is affected in France. There are 4 patients in Ireland since [30 Mar 2021].

Germany has 49 cases of which 13 are confirmed since [30 Mar 2021] with 23 females and 12 males sick. The age range of those affected is from 1 to 79 years old. In the Czech Republic, 4 cases have been reported between [22 Mar 2021] and [29 Apr 2021]. They are 3 females and 1 male aged 1 to 40 years old. 2 cases in Spain from [28 Feb 2021] and [9 Apr 2021] are in infants, 2 and 5 months old. Switzerland has 15 cases with 12 confirmed between [24 Mar 2021] and [7 May 2021]. 12 are females and 3 males from 7 months to 87 years of age.

[All 3 types of melon grow on the ground and can be contaminated through tainted irrigation water. The flesh is then contaminated when the rind is cut into.

The Galia melon [which I had not heard of], also known as sarda in South East Asia, is a type of F1 hybrid melon https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galia_melon originating from a cross between the green-flesh melon cultivar 'Ha-Ogen' and the netted-rind melon cultivar 'Krimka'. Developed in Israel at the NeÂ´ve Yaar Research Center of the Agricultural Research Organization and released in 1973, the Galia melon was named after the developer's daughter, whose name means "God's wave" in Hebrew. They are not particularly difficult to grow. Galias are now grown in Algeria, Brazil, Guatemala, Portugal, Spain, Morocco, Southern US regions, Costa Rica, Panama, Honduras, Greece, Turkey, Israel, and Egypt. - Mod.LL
