Outbreak of _E. coli_ infections linked to ground beef
------------------------------------------------------
Since the last update on 26 Apr 2019, 19 more ill people were added to this outbreak.

As of 13 May 2019, 196 people infected with the outbreak strain of _E. coli_ O103 have been reported from 10 states. CDC is reporting the 196 illnesses that the PulseNet laboratory network has confirmed are part of this outbreak. States are investigating additional illnesses that might be a part of this outbreak.

Illnesses started on dates from 1 Mar 2019 to 19 Apr 2019. Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 84 years, with a median age of 19. 52 percent are female. Of 174 people with information available, 28 (16%) have been hospitalized. No deaths and 2 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome have been reported.

Illnesses that occurred after 21 Mar 2019, might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill with _E. coli_ and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 3 weeks.

Investigation of the outbreak
-------------------------
This multistate investigation began on 28 Mar 2019, when officials in Kentucky and Georgia notified CDC of this outbreak. Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicates that ground beef is the likely source of this outbreak.

In interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. Of the 147 people interviewed, 115 (78%) reported eating ground beef. This percentage is significantly higher than results from a survey of healthy people. Ill people bought or ate ground beef from several different grocery stores and restaurants. Many ill people bought large trays or chubs of ground beef from grocery stores and used the meat to make dishes like spaghetti sauce and sloppy joe.

Officials in Tennessee collected ground beef from a restaurant where ill people reported eating. Laboratory testing identified the outbreak strain of _E. coli_ O103 in the ground beef collected in Tennessee.

2 companies recalled raw ground beef products because they may be contaminated with _E. coli_. Grant Park Packing in Franklin Park, Illinois, recalled approximately 53 200 pounds of raw ground beef products on 24 Apr 2019 [see https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts/recall-case-archive/archive/2019/recall-048-2019-release]. K2D Foods, doing business as Colorado Premium Foods, in Carrollton, Georgia, recalled approximately 113 424 pounds of raw ground beef products on 23 Apr 2019 [see https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts/recall-case-archive/archive/2019/recall-047-2019-release]. These products were sold to restaurants and institutions.

USDA-FSIS and state regulatory officials continue to collect products for testing and continue their traceback investigations to determine the source of ground beef supplied to grocery stores and restaurants where ill people ate. At this time, no common supplier, distributor, or brand of ground beef has been identified that could account for the whole outbreak. Consumers should handle ground beef safely and cook it thoroughly.

CDC will provide more information as it becomes available.
