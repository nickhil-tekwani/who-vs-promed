A child has been admitted to [an infectious diseases] hospital in
Krasnodar with signs of rabies. The child is from a gipsy family.
Currently, the child is receiving immunization [post-exposure
prophylaxis] in the Intensive Care Unit, and his condition is very
serious. His doctors are still accessing the extent of his exposure,
and also of his relatives, and are reviewing the history of the case.

The regional surveillance authority has stated that this is the 1st
case of [human] rabies in the Krasnodar Krai since 2004. The previous
case was a nurse who had been bitten by a dog. This person never
sought post-exposure prophylaxis and died several days later.

It has been decided to immunize all the members of the gipsy community
to which the child belonged. Currently, a group from the community is
traveling to the regional center for vaccine administration.

[Krasnodar is a city in Southern Russia, located on the Kuban River
about 148 km (92 miles) northeast of the Black Sea port of
Novorossiysk. It is the administrative center of the Krasnodar Krai.
It can be located in the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at:
http://healthmap.org/r/1n1N.

Unfortunately, as the affected child is already exhibiting symptoms of
rabies virus infection, it is unlikely that his life will be saved by
post-exposure vaccination. - Mod.CP]
