The Municipal Health Foundation (FMS) confirmed the 1st case of Oropouche fever in Teresina. The FMS "received test results indicative of Oropouche virus infection in a patient hospitalized in the Teresina Emergency Hospital (HUT) in January 2021." This fever has symptoms similar to those of dengue, but with less risk of complications.

The FMS reported that the hemagglutination-inhibition test, ELISA, and RT-PCR done by the Instituto Evandro Chagas (the reference laboratory of the Ministry of Health) confirmed the disease. "The epidemiological investigation carried out by the FMS indicated that the patient was infected in Teresina."

According to the FMS, "Oropouche fever is an arbovirus, that is, a virus transmitted by mosquitoes, that presents with symptoms similar to those of dengue, although with a lesser risk of hermorrhagic complications and of death."

An informative note issued by Amariles de Souza Borba, Director of FMS Health Surveillance, clarifies that, rarely, cases can be complicated by viral (benign) meningitis. The main mosquito that transmits the disease among humans is _Culicoides paraensis_, better known as "maruim" [noseeums].

"Oropouche fever has caused epidemic outbreaks in various Brazilian states, especially in the Amazon region," indicated FMS. "The disease can occur sporadically (isolated cases) or as outbreaks or epidemics."

Prevention
"The preventive measures consist of avoiding breeding sites of, and contact with, mosquitoes, similar to those precautions against dengue."

The local epidemiological surveillance network indicates that "they are attentive and aware of the occurrence of outbreaks with symptoms similar to dengue but with tests negative for that disease."

"The FMS Zoonosis unit (GEZOON) has carried out entomological surveillance by capture of vectors (mosquitoes) around the residence of the patient in order to classify, identify, and detect virus in them."

[ProMED thanks MFS for calling this case to our attention.

Because Oropouche fever outbreaks can occur in Brazil, increased surveillance for case and vector detection are prudent preventive measures. With 868 075 inhabitants, Teresina is the 21st largest city in Brazil, so the risk of an outbreak is real.

Oropouche virus [OROV] is endemic in the Amazon Basin, and human cases have been documented in Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Panama, and Trinidad and Tobago. Reports of cases in these countries have been sporadic but likely underdiagnosed. Because fever with a rash is typical of dengue fever, yellow fever, chikungunya, and Zika virus infections, timely laboratory support is essential to make a differential diagnosis.

Although _Culicoides paraensis_, the vector of Oropouche virus, occurs from the northern USA to Argentina, human cases have been recognized only in the Amazon Basin and Trinidad and Tobago. One wonders if there is a possibility that cases are occurring in other countries where this vector midge is found, but go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed as dengue fever, yellow fever, chikungunya, or Zika virus infections. Perhaps OROV diagnostic capability in all tropical areas where the vector occurs would reveal more cases.
