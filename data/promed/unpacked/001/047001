Rotavirus Outbreak - San Salvador
---------------------------------
Since Sat 23 Dec 2000 a total of 6738 cases of rotavirus infection have
been treated by the national hospital services. Rotavirus infection causes
vomiting and diarrhea and affects more frequently children younger than 5
years of age living in deficient hygienic conditions.
Guillermo Mata, Head of the San Salvador Medical College, declared that
whereas scientific data indicate a mortality rate of one death in 200 000
children, the national rate was 1 in 1123 cases. At the same time [he]
warned the Government about giving priority to economic policies while not
addressing social problems with the same interest. More than 50% of the
cases have been registered in the capital in the areas of Zacamil,
Ayutuxtepeque, Mejicanos y Apopa, where there is lack of drinking water and
sanitary infrastructure is scarce.
The National Association of Pediatricians recommends that [parents and
child-minders] should consult a health professional before treating sick
infants. Surfaces in contact with the virus should be treated with soap
and alcohol.

[The high mortality is a reflection of poor standards of hygiene and
sanitation, and is not uncommon in other developing nations. Additional
problems are that rotaviruses are relatively resistant to chemical
disinfectants and are antigenically diverse. There is no specific therapy,
and a promising rotavirus vaccine has had to be withdrawn on account of
unforeseen side-effects. Hopefully some of the earthquake relief funds
going to San Salvador will be used in the long term to improve social
infrastructure. - Mod.CP]
