The Health Department in American Samoa is awaiting test results for
a 10-year old boy who died recently at the LBJ hospital with symptoms
of dengue fever. There have been 78 confirmed cases of dengue fever
since January [2007].
The Communicable Disease Nurse for Public Health, Charmaine Edwards,
says blood samples have been sent to Honolulu. She says while there's
awareness about the disease, some are not taking the necessary precautions.

Possible dengue fever cases found in Yap State, Federated States of Micronesia
---------------------------------------------------
During the first week of September [2007], 6 cases meeting the
Pacific Public Health Surveillance Network's dengue fever clinical
case definition presented to Yap outpatient clinics .
On 6 Sep [2007], 4 of the 6 tested positive for dengue [virus
antibody] using Pentax rapid IgM tests. Serum is being sent for
confirmation. None of the cases required hospitalization.
An important caveat: during Yap's recent Zika outbreak, it was found
that Zika IgM will elicit a positive result on rapid IgM dengue
tests. This will affect the specificity of the rapid IgM tests for
dengue in Yap because much of our community was exposed to the Zika
virus in April, May and June [2007]. Therefore confirmation will be
especially important.
Yap State's initial response is being coordinated by the Yap Epinet
team. While awaiting confirmation, the Epinet Team has already
started to respond to a likely dengue outbreak with usual
surveillance enhancement, outbreak control measures, and utilization
of clinical guidelines. Support and supplies previously donated by
the WHO and [USA's] CDC for the recent Zika outbreak have already
played in an important role in the initial response to these suspect cases.

Chairman, Yap Epinet Team
<yapepinet@fsmhealth.fm>
[ProMED again thanks Dr. Bel for providing timely information about
this outbreak and their response to it. Given the cross-reactivity of
flavivirus antibody, the Yap team is justifiably cautious about
definitely identifying dengue virus as the etiological agent. _Aedes_
vector mosquito control would be the same to interrupt transmission
of both dengue & Zika viruses. - Mod.TY]
[It is puzzling as to how these cases differ clinically from the Zika
cases they had recently, as both give fever, joint pains and rash. I
wonder why they don't think they are just a recrudescence of the Zika
virus outbreak? - Mod.JW]

Caraguatatuba has the most dengue cases in its history
-------------------------------------------------------
Currently, there are 808 persons infected [with dengue virus] from
_Aedes aegypti_ bite in the municipality. In 2004, 502 cases were
registered. The number of confirmed dengue cases in Caraguatatuba
(173 km [107.5 miles] from Sao Paulo) has never been so high.
Ricardo de Sousa, coordinator of the dengue combat team of
Caraguatatuba, confirmed that during the height of the epidemic,
together with the Superintendancy of Epidemic Control, [they] carried
out chemical house-to-house [vector] control. "The municipality has a
larval density of 1.4 percent. There have been 808 [dengue] cases
registered and 1360 notified, which represents an emergency
situation," he said. [It is not clear what the difference is between
registered & notified. - Mod.JW]
This year [2007] 59 498 dengue cases have been registered in the
state of Sao Paulo. The hot, rainy summer weather, along with the
intense circulation of dengue [virus] 3, and [Sao Paulo's] proximity
to Mato Grosso do Sul [state] (which has experienced the worst
[dengue] epidemic in its history), are the principal factors
[responsible for the current dengue outbreak] scene in Sao Paulo.

Honduran Dengue Fever Crisis Worsens
-----------------------------------------
The expansion of dengue fever in Honduras is reaching [levels] of a
national crisis, since almost 1600 new cases were registered last
week [27-31 Aug 2007], most of them in the capital [Tegucigalpa].
Despite the effort of health authorities, there are unhealthy sectors
in the city, and negligence also facilitates the appearance of new
[breeding sites] for _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes.
Statistics from the Honduran Public Health Ministry said 8 people
have died as a consequence of dengue fever. The classical variety of
the disease has affected 16 878 people, and the hemorrhagic one, 823 people.
Local newspaper El Heraldo reported more than 50 percent of the cases
appeared in the capital, where it was questioned that the yellow
alert [should] be maintained, despite the number of affected people.
Honduran Public Health Minister Jenny Meza admitted the struggle
should be intensified, but she demanded greater compliance with
cleaning measures and instructions.

cases monitored in August 2006. From January to August this year
[2007], dengue cases here already totalled 189. The figure is 50-60
percent higher compared to the 96 cases during the same period last year.
There were 10 recorded deaths pending the filing of the death
certificate of a grade school pupil from Arevalo district who died
last Sunday [26 Aug 2007] due to dengue. The confirmation of the said
death will bring to 11 the number of dengue deaths and 190 cases in the city.
There were only 4 dengue deaths recorded in 2006.

Another 89 cases of dengue fever were reported around Taiwan last
week [9-15 Aug 2007], including 44 cases involving residents in a
veterans' home in Tainan City's East District, a Department of Health
(DOH) official said yesterday [21 Aug 2007]. Chou Chih-hau, deputy
director-general of the DOH's Center for Disease Control (CDC), said
the cluster in Tainan was the largest in nearly 10 years.
The 1st case of the cluster was reported 8 Aug [2007] followed by
more cases on 13 and 14 Aug [2007]. Tainan City's Health Bureau and
the [Taiwan] CDC then started examinations of residents and inspected
the environment around the veterans' home, which houses more than 400
veterans in their 70s or 80s. The CDC discovered that 44 residents
were infected with dengue fever and found that drains on the roof and
water reservoirs of the facility's air conditioners were the main
mosquito breeding areas.
Chou said elderly people infected with dengue fever do not show
obvious symptoms of rash and high fever of up to 39 degrees C [102.2
degrees F]. He reminded nursing homes to heed the situation and clean
water storage containers around residences to avoid another cluster
of infection.
Chou said the North District of Tainan City also reported its 2nd
indigenous dengue fever case -- a 2-year-old girl who was diagnosed
with the disease 6 Aug [2007]. She was discharged from the hospital
17 Aug [2007].
Meanwhile, Kaohsiung County officials responsible for health and
environmental protection affairs were mobilized for an urgent
undertaking aimed at preventing an outbreak of dengue fever. County
Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsiung ordered officials to reinforce efforts to
cleanse mosquito-breeding sites after the southern county reported
last week its first indigenous dengue fever case this summer. The
patient, a woman aged over 50, resides in the county's Fengshan City
but works in the neighboring city of Kaohsiung, County Director of
Health Huang Chih-chung said, noting that Kaohsiung City is one of
southern Taiwan's dengue-affected areas, with 52 cases of indigenous
dengue fever reported so far since the beginning of the summer.

According to the Health Ministry, Viet Nam has had 52 107 cases of
dengue fever so far this year [2007], including 49 deaths. Southern
provinces comprising Tien Giang, Dong Thap, An Giang, Kien Giang and
Soc Trang have witnessed the highest numbers of dengue fever patients.
According to health experts, the number of dengue fever cases this
year is the highest since 1999. [In 1998 the country had 230 000
cases, the highest level in the past 10 years].
The Health Ministry has set up 6 working groups to evaluate the
dengue fever situation in 17 southern, 4 central and 3 northern
provinces of high risk. The ministry has also provided 3000 liters
[792.5 gallons] of anti-mosquito chemical for the HCM City Pasteur
Institute to kill mosquitoes in the south, and 2670 liters [705.3
gallons] of solution to cure dengue fever for provinces of high risk
[prevent cases by vector mosquito control, not cure them. - Mod.TY].

A total of 25 people have been confirmed to have contracted dengue
fever in Zhuhai, a city in South China's Guangdong Province, in the
last 2 weeks, the city's vice mayor Deng Qunfang said on Thursday [6
Aug 2007]. The outbreak of dengue was found in 3 localities in the
city. Local health authorities have also found another 16 suspected
cases since 22 Aug [2007], Deng said.
Deng attributed the outbreak to the rainy weather which favored
mosquito reproduction but said the outbreak had been brought under
control. The city set up an emergency headquarters to fight the
disease on Wednesday [5 Sep 2007] and has launched a mass campaign to
clean up the city and kill mosquitoes.
The number of imported cases of [this?] potentially fatal,
mosquito-borne disease has been rising year by year and there have
been several local outbreaks in recent years.
