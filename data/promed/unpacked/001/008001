The Teramo zooprophylactic institute has confirmed the existence of a clinical outbreak of bluetongue (BT) serotype 4 in the Bari Sardo farms. In fact, sanctioning a dramatic reality: Ogliastra and Nuorese have officially entered an emergency. In recent days, in the Ogliastra area, where the first symptoms of the disease, carried by an insect -- the culicoid -- which affects sheep and other ruminants appeared at the beginning of August [2021], 17 outbreaks were recorded with 3646 animals involved. Of these, 127 show symptoms of the disease with fever, mastitis and decreased milk production, while 6 sheep died. A circumstance that yesterday morning led the mayor of Bari Sardo, Ivan Mameli, to sign the order for the disposal of the first carcasses. Shortly, probably, other measures will follow, signed by the local authorities of Ilbono, Girasole, Triei, Villagrande Strisaili and Tortol√¨, the municipalities where the other outbreaks were found and to which Lanusei was added yesterday. The same risk is related to farms in the province of Nuoro (Ortueri, Olzai and Sorgono).

Now with the virus that has crossed the Ogliastra borders reaching as far as Mandrolisai, it is hoped that the few vaccinations performed by the veterinary services of the Assl di Nuoro and Lanusei are in a state to counteract the spread of the virus.

What caused the disease to explode after 4 years of absence is currently difficult to establish. BT serotype 4, isolated in animal samples first by the Zooprophylactic Institute of Sassari and then confirmed by the Teramo center, may have remained on the island in latent form or may have made its reappearance in Sardinia transported by the African rains of last month.

Whatever the origin, the lack of prophylaxis remains. Prevention and planning should have been the watchwords in the fight against animal pathology, all the more so after the massacre of 2017 when the same serotype killed the Sardinian flocks, throwing hundreds of farmers into despair who had to bury hundreds of carcasses, and blocked for months the movement of cattle with harmful repercussions for the economy of the livestock sector.

[According to a previous report (ProMED-mail archive no. 20210812.8589576), the samples tested in Sardinia and submitted for confirmation and serotyping to Teramo, were obtained from sentinel cattle, but eventually the disease has become clinically obvious in sheep, the traditional victim of BT virus.

It will be interesting to note if the BTV-4 identified in Sardinia is genetically related/similar to the strain recently reported from the Balearic islands, a Spanish territory in the Eastern Mediterranean. In July 2020, BTV serotype 4 was reported by Algeria to the OIE as the cause of disease in sheep. This strain is long known as being highly pathogenic in sheep.

The indigenous Sarda dairy sheep breed is known to be extremely susceptible to the BT virus. Sheep breeding is a main source of income in Sardinia. Vaccination is the only practical way to diminish losses.

The EC has introduced severe preventive measures in relation to the movement of cattle from BT-affected regions, since cattle, readily infected (mostly subclinically), are regarded potential spreaders of the virus. These measures affect trade, with economic consequences. - Mod.AS
