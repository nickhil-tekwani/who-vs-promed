Nearly 50 people are part of an outbreak of _E. coli_ infections in Scotland, which has closed 5 nurseries. _E. coli_ has been confirmed in 3 nurseries, while another 2 are shut as investigations and testing are carried out. A total of 47 cases have been confirmed. Officials previously said _E. coli_ O157 had sickened a number of young people in the East Lothian area. Some patients were hospitalized, but most people had mild symptoms and did not require hospital treatment.

Cases are linked to Pear Tree Nursery on Church Street and Meadowpark Pear Tree Nursery, both in Haddington and Musselburgh Private Nursery, Bridge Street. Church Street nursery was reopened on 29 Aug 2022. Pear Tree Nursery on West Road is shut, but no cases of _E. coli_ have been confirmed. Musselburgh Private Nursery was closed as a precaution after sicknesses, but now _E. coli_ has been confirmed. Musselburgh Nursery in Stoneybank has also been closed after reports of symptoms and a connection with its sister nursery were identified.

NHS Lothian, local and national agencies, including Public Health Scotland, formed an Incident Management Team (IMT) at the beginning of August [2022] to investigate a cluster of cases at Pear Tree Nursery. Officials said families must remain at home and should not mix with others until they go through the clearance process, which includes producing 2 negative samples. The majority of samples are being processed at the _E. coli_ reference lab in Edinburgh with results taking 2 weeks. Labs are processing more than 500 tests, so there may be delays in getting results to staff and parents.

_E. coli_ O157 infections can develop in different ways, such as by eating contaminated food, touching infected animals or coming into contact with their feces, contact with people who have the illness, or drinking contaminated water. Graham Mackenzie, the consultant in public health medicine and chair of the Incident Management Team investigating the outbreak, said it was vital that parents and carers self-isolate.

"It is crucially important that families understand that this is a rapidly evolving situation and it is affecting the lives of hundreds of people. We need everyone to work with us to bring an end to this outbreak as swiftly as possible," he said. "If you have been given an exclusion order, it means that you must self-isolate at home, just as we have all done with COVID-19. You must not go to work or school, the shops, the playpark, or to parties and sleepovers."

Mackenzie said after 2 negative samples families can return to normal. "There is light at the end of the tunnel and as soon as enough exclusions are lifted and investigations are complete, nurseries will be able to reopen. However, if families choose to mix with others when they have been instructed to self-isolate, they are putting themselves and others at risk," he said.

"As well as staying home, it is vital for siblings or those children leaving the nursery, taking up a new nursery place, and starting school for the first time to remain at home until their exclusion period is complete if they have been in contact with someone with _E. coli_ or any other vomiting bug. This outbreak reinforces the importance of washing hands regularly, particularly before eating or preparing food, and after going to the toilet."

The outbreak in Scotland comes at the same time as a warning from Public Health Wales about an increase in cases of diarrhea and vomiting, specifically those caused by _E. coli,_ in the Wrexham and Flintshire areas.

[Enteric infections including EHEC can spread easily in the childcare setting. Infections with _E. coli_ that produce Shiga toxin, the prototypic strain being O157:H7, can result in bloody, usually non-febrile, diarrhea that may progress to kidney failure and breakdown of red blood cells related to the toxin's effect on the kidney. The use of antibacterials in the early stages of the infection can increase the risk of complications, especially hemolytic uremic syndrome.

Evaluation of asymptomatic children in an EHEC outbreak in the daycare setting can be an important part of control, as found in the following report:

Gilbert M, Monk C, Wang H-L, et al. Screening policies for daycare attendees: lessons learned from an outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 in a daycare in Waterloo, Ontario. Can J Public Health. 2008; 99: 281-5; https://doi.org/10.1007/bf03403755

Abstract
--------
"Objectives: Control measures for enteric outbreaks in childcare settings frequently include screening by stool cultures from symptomatic children only. We present evidence from an investigation of _Escherichia coli_ (_E. coli_) O157:H7 in a daycare in Waterloo, Ontario, to support implementation of a mandatory screening policy for all children during an outbreak.

"Methods: In addition to routine outbreak control measures employed by the health unit, stool samples from all children and staff were collected, with positive _E. coli_ cultures typed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). We conducted a cohort study, using data from the environmental investigation and questionnaires administered to parents and staff, to look for risk factors for infection and to survey parent/staff knowledge regarding appropriate management of diarrhea.

"Results: Overall, 11 _E. coli_ O157:H7 cases were identified (7 lab confirmed); 9 were children. No common source of infection was identified. Factors identified as possibly contributing to person-to-person transmission within the daycare included: i) the underreporting and possible attendance of symptomatic children despite alerting parents to the outbreak and requirements to keep symptomatic children at home, ii) possible transmission from an asymptomatic infected child, and iii) inconsistent understanding among parents and staff regarding diarrhea and appropriate management of a child with diarrhea.

"Discussion/conclusion: This investigation reveals that in childcare settings, _E. coli_ O157:H7 outbreak screening policies based on reported symptoms only may be insufficient. We recommend that such policies be amended to include the collection of at least one stool culture from all children in attendance, regardless of symptom history." - Mod.LL
