The Vermont Health Department says it is working with a retirement community in Shelburne to battle an illness outbreak. Officials said Tue 6 Nov 2018 that 22 cases of shigellosis have been confirmed among Wake Robin residents, staff, and visitors, and 44 probable cases have been reported. Shigella is a type of bacteria that causes diarrhea, stomach cramps and sometimes a fever.

The Health Department says it started its investigation on 18 Oct 2018. It says the CDC is helping to recommend treatment alternatives and prevention for the extensively drug-resistant _Shigella sonnei_ infections. Shigellosis spreads easily from person to person. Officials say the source of the outbreak has not been identified.

Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine says there have been no new onsets of illness since 1 Nov 2018.

[It is not entirely clear what kind of community this is, but it does not appear to be a nursing home where spread of enteric organisms, like in day care centers, is easier. The mechanism of spread is not reported. The original report on this outbreak from the Vermont Department of Health said: "To date, testing of isolates associated with this outbreak has indicated susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and resistance to ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfa [methoxazole]."

Empiric antimicrobial use for diarrheal illnesses remains common. For self-limited milder bacterial enteric diseases, antimicrobials offer little to the patient except for selection of increasingly resistant microflora and drug reactions. Unless salmonellosis is associated with bacteremia, there is little reason to treat. In patients with no fever and significant abdominal pain with or without blood in the diarrhea, the institution of antimicrobials, if the patient is infected with an enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, could precipitate hemolytic uremic syndrome. Clearly, viral diarrhea requires no intervention with antibacterial agents.

Regarding shigellosis, CDC made new recommendations about increasing fluoroquinolone resistance in 2017 (see below). In its classic form manifesting as bacterial dysentery ("the bloody flux") with high fever, bloody and mucous containing diarrhea and tenesmus (spasmotic pain when passing the diarrhea), patients are usually hospitalized and empiric antimicrobials begun prior to the confirmation of shigellosis. Withholding therapy in these cases not only may prolong illness but also prolong the infectivity period in this highly transmissible enteric infection. The CDC recommendations relate more to the milder non-hospitalized cases where withholding antimicrobials can be beneficial, not only for the patient but also for public health. - Mod.LL
