Sharka disease, caused by Plum pox virus (PPV), is probably the most
important disease of stone fruits crops worldwide because of tremendous
yield losses from infected trees (1). During November 2004, symptoms
resembling sharka disease were observed in a plum and apricot orchard
consisting of 5000 trees in Pocito, San Juan Province, Argentina. Apricot
leaves showed chlorotic spots, while plum leaves showed chlorotic rings,
spots, and irregular edges. Plum fruits were deformed and much smaller than
those from symptomless trees. Samples collected from 70 symptomatic trees
were tested using double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assays with a polyclonal antiserum anti-PPV from BIOREBA (Reinach BL1,
Switzerland) and immunosorbent electron microscopy with a polyclonal
antiserum from our laboratory made against a recombinant PPV capsid protein
(CP). The samples were also tested using double-antibody sandwich indirect
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the REAL kit (Durviz, Valencia,
Spain) with 2 different monoclonal antibodies, including Mab 5b that
recognizes all strains of PPV and Mab 4DG5 that is specific for PPV strain
D. Samples were positive with both antibodies in 80 percent of the cases.
Leaf extracts from symptomatic plum samples were also analyzed by
immuno-capture reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. A 1209-bp
fragment was amplified with specific primers that anneal at the 5(prime)
end of the coat protein coding region and the viral 3(prime) end poly A
tail. The amplified fragment was cloned, and the nucleotide sequence was
determined for 2 of the resulting clones (GenBank Accession Nos. DQ299537
and DQ299538). The sequences were 98 percent identical with the PPV-strain
D from the United States (GenBank Accession No. AF360579) and Germany
(GenBank Accession No. X81081). The restriction sites for AluI and RsaI,
previously described (2) as typical for the PPV-D strain, were present in
the expected positions. To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of PPV-D
in Argentina.

[The fruit crop plants mentioned in this report are plum and apricot
(_Prunus domestica_, _P. armeniaca_). They develop symptoms of the disease
sharka when infected by plum pox virus (family: _Potyviridae_, genus:
_Potyirus_). PPV is the most dangerous viral pathogen of stone fruits,
affecting apricot, peach, nectarine, plum, almond and cherry. The virus can
infect many wild species. It is transmitted by aphids and therefore
extremely difficult to control. The Slavic name for plum pox, Sharka, is
the most commonly used name for the disease around the world. PPV has been
known in Europe since the beginning of the 20th century. Since 1950, spread
became more rapid, and in 1999 it reached Canada and the USA. An estimated
100 million trees are infected in Europe. Symptoms depend on the cultivar,
the age of the plant and the nutrient status. On leaves, light green
discolorations and yellow or light green rings may appear. Fruits develop
pigmented rings or line patterns and are often deformed. For plums,
premature fruit fall is abundant. Trees can remain without symptoms for up
to 3 years after infection. At least 4 major strains of the virus are
known, named PPV-D, PPV-M, PPV-C and PPV-EA, differing in symptom severity
and patterns of spread. All strains are considered to be worldwide
quarantine organisms, and fast eradication of infected trees is the most
important instrument to manage the disease.
In this report, PPV-D is the strain detected from samples collected from a
single grove in November 2004 in Argentina. A preliminary report with no
information on the strain identity was posted in 2005 [20050528.1475] and
in which it was stated that the property and its vicinity were placed under
quarantine and all plants were destroyed. PPV was found in 1992 in
neighboring Chile but is now eradicated.
