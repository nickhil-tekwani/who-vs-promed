[Although this is not the H5N1 avian influenza virus infection we are
all too familiar with, all highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses
and all low pathogenic H5 or H7 avian influenza viruses must be
reported to the OIE. Clearly, the risk of transmission to humans from
this mallard duck, which subsequently died by a gunshot wound, is not
nearly as high as with H5N1 poultry flocks. However, H7 avian
influenza viruses have caused human infections in various countries
including the Netherlands, Canada and the UK. In fact, in the
Netherlands, a previously healthy veterinarian died from an H7N7
infection obtained while working with infected poultry flocks.

Reporting outbreaks of all avian influenza viruses having the
potential to cause human disease is critical for building the kind of
knowledge base that will provide a holistic molecular and
geographical picture of the risk of a pandemic strain evolving. A
complete picture of what kinds of viruses are present in humans is
crucial, but the database should be expanded to include studies of
different species that could be, or could have been, harboring the
virus. We know influenza viruses circulate in swine, horses, wild
birds, and, more recently, dogs in addition to humans. Knowledge of
the kinds of viruses present within given species within a given
geographical area must be obtained if we are to have a rich,
contextual database to draw upon when making decisions about the
likelihood of a quick spreading, efficient influenza virus strain
beginning to circulate in any population.
