As China struggles to find the source of the new flu infecting a growing number of its citizens, tests of the usual animal suspects are mostly coming back negative. No pigs and few poultry have so far tested positive for H7N9.

International health officials are scratching their heads over the paucity of positive bird tests for a bird flu, especially given that the human case count is more than double the number of positive bird findings. As of Wed [17 Apr 2013], 82 people had been infected and 17 had died. [As of 18 Apr 2013, China has confirmed 87 cases, 17 died, 5 people were healed].

"Something is happening out there that's not being picked up," says Gregory Hartl, spokesperson for the World Health Organization in Geneva.

"It argues for the fact that we have to continue to cast the investigation net widely."

China's Ministry of Agriculture revealed Wed [17 Apr 2013] that nearly 48 000 tests samples have been taken from live animal markets, farms and slaughter houses across China.

Of those, a mere 39 tested positive: 38 in poultry from markets in the eastern Chinese provinces where most of the human cases have been found and one in a wild pigeon, in the eastern Chinese province of Jiangsu.

Those findings beg the questions: Where is this bird flu hiding? And is China targeting the right species when it goes looking for H7N9?

Infectious diseases expert Michael Osterholm agrees with the suggestion that at this point, investigators need to keep an open mind about where the virus may be coming from.

But the director of the Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota says too little is known about how China is testing for anyone to be confident that all the negative bird tests were true negatives. He suggests more information is needed before people can feel sure that the results being reported are truly as puzzling as they seem.

"There are just a number questions here that we can't answer yet based on the available information," Osterholm said in an interview.

"I think the Chinese have been very forthcoming in providing the results. I think the question now is how to interpret these results ... based on how they got the results."

Osterholm says the questions that need to be answered are: What types of tests are being performed on samples taken from animals and how well are those tests doing at detecting the new virus?

To put this in context, one needs to understand that there was no on-the-shelf test for this H7N9 virus, which is a constellation of bird flu genes that hadn't been seen before.

When a new virus is found, specific tests to detect it must be developed and validated so that laboratories can find the virus in all samples where it exists, and not confuse it with other viruses. In the 3 weeks since China realized it was seeing infections with a new flu virus, it has had to develop and roll out tests to find H7N9 in a variety of species and settings.

Osterholm says another issue that could affect the test results relates to who is taking samples from animals and how well trained they are.

He notes with large outbreaks, authorities sometimes need to draw in people who have few or no skills at grabbing a chicken and swirling a swab around the cloaca, the bird version of an anus. That is where, in poultry, one looks for flu viruses. In people, influenza is a respiratory infection, but in birds, the virus invades the gastric system.

"They obviously had to pull people in to do this that likely did not have great experience with this kind of testing," Osterholm says.

"We have seen in the past issues where the testing done by inexperienced individuals actually resulted in a substantial reduction in the number of positives versus those individuals who had much more experience."

Other factors that need to be considered are how quickly birds move through live animal markets and where they come from. If inspectors come to test after infected birds are sold and leave the market, good tests may still produce negative results.

"It wouldn't be an error of the test; it would just be that the sampling didn't detect it," Osterholm says. "The tests could be giving us exactly the right information, but not testing the right birds. And you can still have a substantial under-reporting."

The complexity of testing for H7N9 is frustrating for public health officials who are used to flu viruses like H5N1 that make their presence know.

That bird flu is no stealth agent. H5N1 has infected at least 622 people in 15 countries since late 2003. In people, it causes mostly devastating illness. In poultry, the result is the same. Whole flocks are wiped out by this highly pathogenic virus.

But in poultry, H7N9 is a virus of low pathogenicity, "low path" as flu researchers say. It's not killing birds. It's not even making them sick, so far as anyone can tell.

That adds an unexpected layer of complexity to the task of finding out how people are contracting the virus. And until authorities can figure out how people are coming in contact with H7N9, they cannot take effective measures to try to stop the virus from infecting people.

Hebei province has put the 1.7 million chickens and ducks on or around Baiyangdian Lake under close observation to keep any instance of the H7N9 virus away from local people. Migratory birds resting in the vast wetland will be watched closely by a group of surveyors at 6 spots who were trained to keep records on the migratory birds and their movements every day. The 1.1 million ducks and 600 000 chickens kept there have been immunized and have been put in cages to keep them away from local people. Any outbreak of an unusual disease will be reported immediately, and professionals will deal with the dead birds carefully, with no local people being allowed to touch them. The wetland surveyors had reported no unusual cases of deaths of migratory geese, ducks, and other birds as of Monday [15 Apr 2013].

Baiyangdian Lake lies along a major migratory bird route and was listed as a major monitoring area after the outbreak of H7N9 flu in southern China. There are 198 kinds of wild birds resting in the wetland every year thanks to the climate and environment, along with the local chickens and ducks.

[If previous reports from east China are to be relied upon, no illness or mortality will be seen in the migratory birds. To trace infection with H7N9, either the virus or antibodies against it should be discovered. Sampling could address organs, excrement and/or sera of migratory birds. - Mod.AS]

The deadly H7N9 avian flu virus can be traced to 3 bird species: a brambling from Beijing, fowl in the Yangtze River Delta, and a wild bird from the Korean peninsula, according to a Chinese scientist.

Xue Yu, a professor at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan in central China, said his research team reached the conclusion about the 3 bird species after completing an analysis of the H7N9 virus's genetic makeup.

Xue said his research team obtained genetic sequence data from 4 H7N9 virus samples for an analytical study, according to the Wuhan-based Changjiang Daily.

The team compared the genetic sequences of the 4 samples with those of 110 000 samples in an influenza virus sequence database in the United States.

"The comparative analysis has allowed us to reach an initial conclusion on the H7N9 virus's evolution," Xue was quoted as saying in the news report.

Sometime before last November [2012], he said, the H9N2 carried by a brambling from Beijing interacted with the H7N3 virus carried by fowl in the Yangtze River Delta.

"Each of these 2 species provided 3 genes to form part of the H7N9 virus. These 6 genes alone, however, would not sicken humans," Xue said.

Roughly at the same time, a duck in Zhejiang Province in the Yangtze River Delta provided hemagglutinin (HA) to turn the above-mentioned genes into H7N2/N3, Xue said.

"This was a critical step for the virus to get the key to infect or invade human or animal cells," Xue said.

In the 3rd stage that took place around 19 Feb 2013, a wild bird from the Korean peninsula brought in the most important element, neuraminidase (NA), to complete the H7N9 virus's genetic makeup of 8 genes, Xue said.

"NA allows the virus to spread freely in its host," Xue said.

He said China has put the genetic sequences of the 4 H7N9 genes into an international database for scientists around the world to analyze and study.

"When we get more samples, we will be able to better understand the evolution of the H7N9 virus," Xue said, adding that the conclusions may be adjusted or even changed fundamentally.

The government has ordered suspension of wild bird sales to prevent spread of the H7N9 bird flu.

The State Forestry Administration Thu [18 Apr 2013] urged local authorities to beef up epidemic surveillance, suspend transactions of wild birds and ban close contact between humans and animals in zoos, according to an emergency notice issued by the administration.

The notice also asks relevant authorities to train staff in the treatment of animals that have died from unidentified diseases.
