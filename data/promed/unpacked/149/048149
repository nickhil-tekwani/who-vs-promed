Las Vegas public health officials say dozens of people linked to a tuberculosis outbreak at a neonatal unit have tested positive for the disease. The Southern Nevada Health District reported on Monday [23 Dec 2013] that of the 977 people tested, 59 showed indications of the disease and 2 showed signs of being contagious.

Dr Joe Iser, chief medical officer at the health district, says the report demonstrates the importance of catching tuberculosis early. Health officials tested hundreds of babies, family members, and staff who were at Summerlin Hospital Medical Center's neonatal intensive care unit this past summer [2013], saying they wanted to take extra precautions after the death of a mother and her twin babies.

They contacted the parents of about 140 babies who were at the unit between mid-May and mid-August [2013].

Las Vegas public health officials say dozens of people linked to a tuberculosis [TB] outbreak at a neonatal unit have tested positive for the disease.

The Southern Nevada Health District reported on Monday [23 Dec 2013] that of the 977 people tested, 59 showed indications of the disease, though all but 2 of the cases are latent -- meaning patients don't show symptoms and aren't contagious.

Dr Joe Iser, chief medical officer at the health district, said the report demonstrates the importance of catching tuberculosis early. "We want physicians to really think about making the diagnosis and quarantining, and then calling us," he said. "This has been very expensive for us in terms of time and effort and dollars."

A state report released last month [November 2013] found that Summerlin Hospital Medical Center failed to recognize and take precautions to diagnose the infected woman's contagious lung disease when she gave birth in May [2013] to premature twin daughters, and allowed the woman to continue visiting her babies after she was discharged.

One of the 25-year-old [mother]'s babies died in June [2013], the mother died in July at a Los Angeles hospital and was diagnosed with tuberculosis through an autopsy. Her other baby died of tuberculosis on 1 Aug [2013] at Summerlin Hospital.

Iser said officials cannot know for sure that all 59 cases are directly linked to the Las Vegas hospital. Several of those tested are immigrants from countries where tuberculosis is more prevalent, and could have been exposed earlier in their lives, he said. The health district is encouraging all 59 people to accept treatment.

TB is spread through the air when a sick person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. Symptoms include coughing, chest pain, fever, and fatigue. The disease usually attacks the lungs, but can affect other organs and can be fatal if not properly treated.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention counted 569 TB deaths in the US in 2010, the most recent year for which data is available. The number of US TB cases has been on a steady decline since a resurgence in 1992, and in 2012, reached the lowest level since national reporting began in 1953.

The Nevada Bureau of Health Care Quality and Compliance investigated the case, and determined that the Las Vegas hospital wasn't taking proper precautions to contain infections. In November [2013], 8 employees, former patients, and visitors filed a negligence lawsuit seeking damages from the hospital. Family members of the young mother who died of the illness have said they also plan to sue.

In the fall [2013], investigators found that 26 people, including the mother's family members and hospital staff, had been infected. Health officials then tested hundreds of babies, family members and staff who had passed through the neonatal intensive care unit. They contacted the parents of about 140 babies who were at the unit between mid-May and mid-August [2013], and set up a temporary clinic to test them. Health officials are expected to release a final report next summer [2014].

They will continue to test the infants who passed through the hospital in the coming months, to ensure the babies don't develop any signs of the disease. "I try to think, what if it was my son or daughter, my newborn infant, what would I want to be done?" Iser said.

[ProMED-mail previously posted reports of this case; please see ProMED-mail post Bovine tuberculosis, human - USA: (NV) nosocomial spread, fatal 20131010.1993861 and Bovine tuberculosis, human - USA (02): (NV) nosocomial spread, fatal, query 20131011.1996441. Those posts described a nosocomial tuberculosis (TB) outbreak due to exposure to a pregnant patient with unsuspected TB who subsequently died of TB meningitis. However, for the patient to have been so highly contagious, as this patient was to have possibly infected 59 contacts, she undoubtedly also had pulmonary TB and the mycobacterial density in her sputum would likely have been very high, allowing discharge of enormous numbers of mycobacteria into the environment as occurs usually when pulmonary cavities are present or perhaps she had laryngeal TB. Nevertheless, the news reports above give no further information on a clinical description of the deceased index patient's TB.

One of her "extremely premature" twins died before the diagnosis of TB was considered; the other twin died as a result of TB. Infants born to women with untreated TB may have lower birth weight than those born to women without TB and in rare circumstances the infant may be born with TB, if the mother has miliary TB, TB of the placenta or uterus, or has advanced HIV (http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/factsheets/specpop/pregnancy.htm). Congenital TB has morbidity and mortality approaching 50 percent (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2813636/).

Because the prior news report said that health officials thought the woman contracted tuberculosis through an unpasteurized dairy product from Latin America, presumably they were referring to tuberculosis due to _Mycobacterium bovis_. In the US, TB due to _M. bovis_ continues to be reported, primarily in immigrants who acquire the infection in their countries of origin where _M. bovis_ infection remains endemic, or in persons of Hispanic ethnicity as a consequence of ingesting dairy foods made from unpasteurized milk of _M. bovis_-infected cows and smuggled across the Mexico-US border (see Levison ME: _Mycobacterium bovis_: An Underappreciated Pathogen. Curr Infect Dis Rep 2008, 10(6): 444-6). However, the news reports above give no further information on the identity of the mycobacterial species isolated from the deceased index patient, her newborn, or her 2 contacts who developed active TB.

One of the news reports above says several of the contacts that tested positive for TB are immigrants from countries where tuberculosis is more prevalent, and could have been exposed earlier in their lives, he said. We are not told if these immigrants were among the 2 contacts who developed active TB. Active TB developing among recent immigrants could be the result of either reactivation of latent TB or actually imported active TB (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24308495). Genotyping of the isolates from the 4 cases with active TB (the deceased index patient, her newborn who died of TB, and her 2 contacts with active TB) would help to confirm a common source.
