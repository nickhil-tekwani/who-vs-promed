Swedish Radio News said the Scandinavian country saw a sharp uptick in the number of cases of syphilis last year [2013], while new cases of chlamydia and gonorrhea are showing signs of slowing down.

The agency reported 275 new cases of syphilis, an increase of 37 percent from 2012; half of which have taken place abroad.

"Changed sexual behavior has contributed to sexually transmitted diseases becoming common. Studies show that condom use among young people is quite low with new and casual partners," epidemiologist Inga Velicko at the agency told Swedish Radio.

[The increased incidence of syphilis in Sweden is similar to the situation in the US and other countries (see prior ProMED-mail posts below). In many countries, the increased incidence of syphilis is occurring mainly among men who have sex with men (MSM), and has been characterized by high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection, high-risk sexual behavior, use of drugs such as methamphetamines, use of Internet chat rooms to meet sex partners (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm), and more recently, use of smartphone applications like Grindr, a gay social networking site. The news report above does not give more information about the epidemiology of the rising incidence of syphilis in Sweden.

However, a Eurosurveillance article in 2008 reported that the spread of syphilis in Sweden among MSM, particularly in the big cities, has been a major contributor to an increase in cases in that country (Velicko I, Arneborn M, Blaxhult A. Syphilis epidemiology in Sweden: re-emergence since 2000 primarily due to spread among men who have sex with men. Eurosurveill. 2008;13(50). Available online: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19063). Estimated syphilis incidence among Swedish MSM was up to 28 times higher than in the general Swedish male population. The most affected age group among males was 25-44 years of age. The majority of infections in men and women through heterosexual contacts were acquired abroad, whereas the majority of infections attributed to sex between men were acquired in Sweden. - Mod.ML
