An outbreak of legionnaires' disease is being investigated in Melbourne's south east after the discovery of 2 cases. The Victorian health department is investigating after 2 cases who live in the Cranbourne East area were reported to authorities on Wednesday [17 Aug 2021]. Both required hospital treatment.

Local cooling towers, pools, and spas are being tested to find the source of the outbreak.

Those who have been in the Cranbourne East area from the start of August [2021] and develop a flu-like illness are being urged to seek immediate medical attention.

Legionnaires' disease is caused by _Legionella_ bacteria, which are widespread in the environment, in natural water bodies such as rivers, lakes, creeks, and hot springs. The bacteria are also found in spas, potting mix, warm water systems, and artificial systems that use water for cooling, heating, or industrial processes, such as cooling towers. People can catch it by breathing in fine droplets of water that contain the bacteria. It cannot be caught from another person or by drinking contaminated water.

Acting deputy chief health officer (Communicable Disease) Dr Mihaela Ivan urged health care professionals on Wednesday [18 Aug 2021] to be on alert for legionnaires' disease in patients with influenza-like symptoms, particularly those with severe pneumonia who've been around the Cranbourne East area since the start of August [2021]. The disease often presents with initial influenza-like symptoms such as myalgia, headache, fever, and cough, and may progress to atypical pneumonia, sometimes with confusion. Those at great risk include those aged over 65, smokers, heavy drinkers, those with chronic lung disease and underlying conditions such as diabetes, cancer, or kidney failure.

Doctors are also being urged to consider alternative diagnoses to COVID-19 for respiratory infections and undertake appropriate investigations. Legionnaires' disease is an urgent notifiable condition, meaning it must be reported to the health department upon initial diagnosis or clinical suspicion as soon as possible and within 24 hours.

There is no vaccine to prevent the disease, but early diagnosis and treatment with appropriate antibiotics can reduce the severity of illness and complications.

[Humans acquire legionnaires' disease after exposure to natural or human-made aquatic reservoirs, usually by means of inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella_ bacteria, but the disease can also be acquired by aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as debilitated hospitalized patients. Possible person-to-person transmission of legionnaires' disease has also been described (Correia AM, Ferreira JS, Borges V, et al. Probable person-to-person transmission of legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374: 497-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356). _Legionella_ infection can be acquired less commonly by contamination of wounds.

More than 70 percent of cases of legionnaires' disease are due to _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1, except in Australia and New Zealand, where _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 has accounted for only 45.7 percent of cases of community-acquired legionellosis and 30.4 percent are _L. longbeachae_ (Yu VL, Plouffe JF, Pastoris MC, et al. Distribution of _Legionella_ species and serogroups isolated by culture in patients with sporadic community-acquired legionellosis: an international collaborative survey. J Infect Dis. 2002; 186(1): 127-8; https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/186/1/127/837207).

Legionnaires' disease due to _L. longbeachae_ is associated with exposure to aerosols generated during the use of non-sterilized potting soil, which apparently contains free-living amoebae and elevated storage temperatures may foster the intra-amoebic growth of _L. longbeachae_ in the potting soil (Ross IS, Mee BJ, Riley TV. _Legionella longbeachae_ in Western Australian potting mix. Med J Aust 1997; 166(7): 387; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.5694/j.1326-5377.1997.tb123175.x).

A cluster of cases usually refers to multiple cases in space and time that are possibly linked. An outbreak of legionnaires' disease implies a common source is suspected (https://legionnaires.ecdc.europa.eu/?pid=205). Culture for _Legionella_ in sputum and suspected environmental sources and genotyping the isolates will help delineate transmission pathways. A common source is suggested if the genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from patient specimens match; genotyping environmental isolates of _Legionella_ can point to the possible source for those patients if the environmental and patient genotypes match. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease in the 2 patients was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no isolates for genotyping.

A previous outbreak of legionnaires' disease in Cranbourne, a suburb 43 km (26.7 mi) southeast of Melbourne's central business district, was suspected to have originated from cooling towers near a shopping center (see ProMED post Legionellosis - Australia (02): (VI, SA) 20170513.5034030). Cranbourne East, where the current cases reside, is 3.5 km east of Cranbourne.

Melbourne, with a population of about 4.6 million residents, is the capital and most populous city in the Australian state of Victoria, and the 2nd-most populous city in Australia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne).
