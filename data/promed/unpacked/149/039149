Investigations of the suspicious case in poultry in Northern Ireland excluded involvement with notifiable avian influenza (H5 and H7 subtypes) plus Newcastle disease.

[We are grateful to Professor Brown for the above response, indicating that no avian influenza cases have been identified in Northern Ireland (and, actually, in the UK) during the current season.

According to DEFRA/APHA's updated situation assessment, the recent HPAI H5N8 outbreaks in Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic, which are the 1st reports of HPAI in Europe so far this winter (2019/2020, in either domestic poultry or wild birds), cannot be taken as reassuring regarding the risk for incursions to the UK. Because of the lower numbers of H5 HPAI outbreaks observed in 2018/2019, there may now be more limited immunity in the naive wild bird population to H5 viruses, with a large susceptible population of hosts in the form of juvenile birds migrating to the UK every autumn. The experts recommended that all poultry keepers stay vigilant and make themselves aware of the latest information on <www.gov.uk>, particularly about recommendations for biosecurity and how to register their flocks.
