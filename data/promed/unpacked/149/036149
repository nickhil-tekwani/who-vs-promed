Saskatoon public health officials are worried about the increasing number of syphilis cases in Saskatoon [Saskatchewan Province, Canada]. Recently, an outbreak of the sexually transmitted infection in the city was declared, prompting the University of Saskatchewan to email its students advising regular testing for the disease.

Dr. Johnmark Opondo, Saskatoon's deputy medical health officer, said social media sites often used by people to arrange sexual encounters are factors. "It is really not a speculation. It is an observation," Opondo said. Opondo said health officials can substantiate the link because they know that people in Saskatoon who have confirmed cases of syphilis were using certain social media sites to meet sex partners.

"The syphilis came from somewhere, so we really try to track down who else may have been exposed, who else might be infected that we don't know about so that we can ensure that that person gets treatment as well," Opondo explained.

Opondo said Saskatoon has seen a significant increase in the 1st 3 months of 2014 alone, with 9 confirmed cases of syphilis, compared to 3 in all of 2013.

The University of Saskatchewan is encouraging students to get tested through a urine sample at Student Health Services.

The Saskatoon Health Region said syphilis is spread by contact with sores, rashes or body fluids during vaginal, anal or oral sex. Officials said it can be dangerous if not caught in the early stages. Left untreated, it can cause damage to many body systems and can even be deadly. Opondo also cautioned that having syphilis can make a person more likely to be infected with other sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Pregnant women with syphilis can experience complications including miscarriage, serious birth defects, as well as the death of the newborn.

[Saskatoon is the largest city in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan, with an estimated population of 253 000 and an estimated metropolitan area population of 300 000 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatoon). The University of Saskatchewan is a Canadian public research university located in Saskatoon. The economy of Saskatoon has been associated with potash, oil and agriculture (specifically wheat) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatoon). Saskatchewan is in the region that is undergoing an oil boom since 2006 from the Bakken Shale formation, which occupies about 200 000 square miles (520 000 square km) of the subsurface rock in the Williston Basin (http://www.thebakkenshale.com), underlying parts of Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.

Saskatchewan is having problems with Aboriginal-based gangs that range from very loosely organized neighborhood-level youth groups to more sophisticated and highly organized crime groups involved in drug trafficking, prostitution, firearms offences, and witness intimidation (http://www.csgv.ca/wp-content/uploads/AboriginalGangsSask.pdf). Saskatoon has the 2nd highest percentage of First Nations (Aboriginal) population among major Canadian cities at nearly 9 percent, with certain neighborhoods having over 40 percent (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatoon#Aboriginal_peoples).

The rates of early syphilis in Canada, as in the United States, have been increasing since about 2000. In Canada, the male-to-female rate ratio increased from 1.5:1.0 in 1999 to 6.4:1.0 in 2008, reflecting that more males than females were reported with early syphilis, and this disparity increased over time (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/std-mts/report/sti-its2008/05-eng.php). In 2008, men accounted for 86.1 percent of reported cases. Between 1999 and 2008, the rate in men increased from 0.7 to 7.3 per 100 000 and in women increased from 0.5 to 1.1 per 100 000. In men, the highest reported rate of early syphilis was shared between 25-29 year olds and 30-39 year olds (13.3 per 100 000) (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/std-mts/report/sti-its2008/05-eng.php). Together, these age groups accounted for almost 40 percent of reported cases in men in 2008. In women, the highest reported rate was in 20-24 year olds (3.6 per 100 000). In males, the greatest increase in reported rates of early syphilis between 1999 and 2008 was in 25-29 year olds.

Most of the Canadian syphilis outbreaks have been in men who have sex with men (MSM), some of which have been associated with the acquisition of anonymous sex partners through the Internet; other outbreaks were related to the sex trade, and some have been locally acquired infections in heterosexual persons (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/std-mts/sti-its/cgsti-ldcits/section-5-10-eng.php).

According to the news report above, the syphilis outbreak in Saskatoon, as in the United States, has been associated with the acquisition of anonymous sex partners through the Internet and may be occurring among the University of Saskatchewan students, but details of the outbreak such as gender, age, sexual behavior, ethnicity, use of illicit drugs, HIV co-infection, or prostitution are not given in the news report above. Such information would be greatly appreciated from knowledgeable persons.

Smart mobile phone social networking applications have become fashionable for users to find sexual partners. Reported increases in incidence of early syphilis among MSM have been characterized by high rates of use of the Internet to meet sex partners (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm) and more recently use of smartphone applications like Grindr, a gay social networking site (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grindr). Grindr allows users to meet other men within close proximity using the mobile device's global positioning system (GPS) location-based services to show men nearby who are also on Grindr. Blendr, another social networking app, also combines GPS location sensing with a social networking framework and provides users with the opportunity to meet people who are within a close physical proximity. A discussion of the risk for acquisition of sexually transmitted diseases associated with use of the Internet, mobile phones and social networking sites can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/std/life-stages-populations/Adolescents-white-paper.pdf. - Mod.ML
