So far in 2014, Guanajuato State has reported 847 patients treated for hepatitis A, ranking as the 2nd state with the highest number of cases of the disease in Mexico. According to the Federal Secretariat for Health Epidemiological Bulletin, as of 30 Aug 2014, 425 men and 422 women in the state have received medical attention for the illness.

The report indicates that Yucatan is the state with the most cases reported in 2014 with 1015 patients, followed by Guanajuato. Other states with high numbers of cases include the Federal District with 693 cases, the State of Mexico with 645, San Luis Potosi with 629, Jalisco with 526, and Oaxaca with 511.

[Absolute numbers of cases is not as useful as the number of cases per 100 000 population as this latter statistic will control for population differences between cases. In looking at comparative numbers, [I believe] for the same time period in 2013, only Oaxaca and San Luis Potosi had higher numbers in 2014.

Hepatitis A is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus. The virus is spread by faecal-oral transmission. Hepatitis A is closely associated with inadequate sanitation and poor personal hygiene. Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis A infection does not cause chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal, but it can cause debilitating symptoms. Hepatitis A occurs sporadically and in epidemics worldwide, with a tendency for cyclic recurrences. Waterborne outbreaks, though infrequent, are usually associated with sewage contaminated- or inadequately treated water.

Casual contact among people does not spread the virus. In developing countries (where sanitary conditions are poor), most children experience infection in early childhood. As a consequence of poor sanitary conditions and hygienic practices, most children (up to 90 percent) have been infected with the hepatitis A virus before the age of 10. Those infected in childhood do not experience any noticeable symptoms. Consequently, epidemics are uncommon because older children and adults are generally immune. Symptomatic disease rates in these areas are low, and outbreaks are rare.

In developed countries with adequate sanitary conditions, prior to the availability of the hepatitis A vaccine, children often escape infection in early childhood. Ironically, these improved economic and sanitary conditions may lead to a higher susceptibility in older age groups, and because infections that occur in adolescents and adults are more often symptomatic, higher disease rates and large foodborne outbreaks may occur. - Mod.LL
