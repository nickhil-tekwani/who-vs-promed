A case of enterovirus EV-D68 has been confirmed at Bound Brook High School [Somerset County, New Jersey], Superintendent of Schools Daniel Gallagher wrote in a recent posting on the school district's website. The school district's administration and physician worked with the district's physician and the Middle-Brook Regional Health Department to ensure that all of the proper protocols were being followed, Gallagher said. Those protocols included a "thorough cleaning of the building" to ensure that it is safe for students and staff members, Gallagher said.

Enteroviruses (EV) are common viruses with more than 100 different types that are around mostly in the summer and fall. EV infections can cause mild or severe symptoms, and are more common in infants, children and teenagers. The state has confirmed 17 cases of EV-D68 in New Jersey.

Public Health Madison and Dane County [PHMDC, Wisconsin] has been notified of test results of 5 cases of a respiratory virus making its rounds across the area, but Monona Grove school officials say there is no reason for concern. Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is a virus that is reportedly causing mild to severe respiratory illness (runny nose, cough, difficulty breathing) with and without fever. Enteroviruses are very common. There are more than 100 types of enterovirus, although this EV-D68 strain has previously been uncommon in the United States, according to the PHMDC.

In other states, presumed EV-D68 outbreaks are resulting in growing numbers of children requiring emergency room visits and hospitalizations, primarily for difficulties with breathing and severe asthma. No such details are currently available regarding the Dane County cases.

Guidelines for students who are ill are posted on the district website [and] are occasionally put into school newsletters for parents. These guidelines focus on fever, vomiting, diarrhea, severe nausea, infectious diseases, rashes and injuries. If a child has a fever of 100 degrees Fahrenheit [about 37.8 degrees Celsius] or more, the child should be kept home until 24 hours after the fever has resolved without giving fever-reducing medication. Vomiting, diarrhea and severe nausea are symptoms to keep the child home until he or she is able to tolerate a normal diet for 24 hours after the symptoms are resolved. Rashes or patches of broken, itchy skin need to be examined by a doctor if they appear to be spreading or not improving. Some rashes may need to be covered while the child is at school. EV-D68 can be found in saliva, nasal mucus or sputum and, like the common cold, likely spreads from person to person when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or a person touches contaminated surfaces. Infants, children and teenagers are more likely than adults to get infected with enteroviruses and become sick.

"It is common to see more respiratory illnesses at this time of year caused by many different viruses," said Amanda Kita-Yarbro, communicable disease epidemiologist for PHMDC. "Usually symptoms are mild and limited, but if you are concerned about your own or your child's symptoms, it's important to call your health care provider." EV-D68 is not a reportable disease, which means that hospitals and healthcare providers are not required to report cases to local health departments.

Activity of enterovirus D68-like illness in states
--------------------------------------------------
The United States is currently experiencing a nationwide outbreak of enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) associated with severe respiratory illness.
- From mid-August to 22 Oct 2014, CDC or state public health laboratories have confirmed a total of 941 people in 46 states and the District of Columbia with respiratory illness caused by EV-D68.
- CDC expects that, as with other enteroviruses, EV-D68 infections will likely begin to decline by late fall.
- CDC has received informal reports from some hospitals and states that are seeing signs of decreasing EV-D68 infections. CDC is gathering more information from states and assessing whether this represents a national trend.

Every year, enteroviruses and rhinoviruses cause millions of respiratory illnesses in children. This year [2014], EV-D68 has been the commonest type of enterovirus identified, leading to increases in illnesses among children and affecting those with asthma most severely. Other rhinoviruses and enteroviruses continue to be detected as well.
- CDC has received substantially more specimens for enterovirus lab testing than usual this year, due to the large outbreak of EV-D68 and related hospitalizations.
- CDC has prioritized testing of specimens from children with severe respiratory illness. There are likely many children affected with milder forms of illness.
- Of the more than 1400 specimens tested by the CDC lab, about half have tested positive for EV-D68. About 1/3rd have tested positive for an enterovirus or rhinovirus other than EV-D68.
- See latest report from states on activity of enterovirus D68-like illness [http://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/outbreaks/EV-D68-activity.html].
- Almost all the confirmed cases this year of EV-D68 infection have been among children. Many of the children had asthma or a history of wheezing.

EV-D68 has been detected in specimens from 7 patients who died and had samples submitted for testing. CDC is reporting test results to state health departments as we obtain them.
- State and local officials have the authority to determine the cause of death, including the role that EV-D68 may have played. They also have the authority to determine the appropriate information to release, and the time to release it. CDC will defer to states to provide this information.

[Enterovirus infections commonly occur in the United States in summer and fall. Right now, enteroviruses and rhinoviruses are likely contributing the most to the increase in respiratory illnesses. This year (2014), the commonest type of enterovirus detected has been EV-D68. Many people with mild respiratory illness may not go to the doctor. By the end of fall, enterovirus infections are expected to decline. At about the same time, respiratory illnesses caused by other viruses, like influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), will become commoner.
