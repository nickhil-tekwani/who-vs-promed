Legionnaires' outbreak in Westchester
-------------------------------------
The number of cases of legionnaires' disease grew to 12 today, Sat 16 Jul
2005, in an outbreak at Sound Shore Medical Center in New Rochelle.
The Westchester County health department said 6 of the victims had already
recovered or were recovering at home, while another 6 are hospital
inpatients in stable condition. Department spokeswoman Mary Landrigan said
the count could go up again as patients with pneumonia are checked for the
presence of the bacterium which causes the disease.
Health Commissioner Joshua Lipsman said that all the victims were Sound
Shore outpatients who used an entrance to the hospital that took them past
a cooling tower used for air conditioning. Water in the cooler tested
positive for the bacteria but has been treated. Landrigan said the new
cases fell into the same category.

9 cases of legionnaires' disease identified in New Rochelle
-----------------------------------------------------------
The Westchester County Department of Health announced today, Thu 14 Jul
2005, that 9 cases of legionnaires' disease have been identified in New
Rochelle since 21 Jun 2005. Additional cases of patients with pneumonia are
also being investigated as possible legionnaires' cases. In previous years,
there have only been 7 to 10 cases of legionnaires' disease reported
countywide annually.
Preliminary investigation by the New York State Department of Health and
the Westchester County Department of Health indicates a possible source of
contamination may be an outdoor cooling tower on the campus of the Sound
Shore Medical Center. Water samples were obtained earlier this week from
the hospital's cooling tower, and an initial test indicated the presence of
legionella bacteria; follow-up testing is under way. Although this tower
has not been confirmed as the source of the bacteria, hospital officials
are voluntarily disinfecting the unit as a precautionary measure. "Sound
Shore Medical Center is to be commended for its rapid response to the
possible cause of the problem by aggressive disinfection of the cooling
tower," said Joshua Lipsman, commissioner of health.
John Spicer, president of Sound Shore Medical Center, assured patients and
staff that the Sound Shore Medical Center is taking every precaution to
assure the health and safety of staff and patients. Mr Spicer also noted
that additional measures were instituted as soon as the hospital became
aware of the possibility that the cooling tower might be a source. These
measures included super chlorination of the cooling tower and the addition
of biocide to reduce the biofilm level. The tower had been previously
tested in May 2005 and was found to be negative for legionella.
"Although there has been very rapid response to this situation, it is
possible that additional cases may be identified," said Dr Lipsman. Early
symptoms of legionellosis may be flu-like, with muscle aches, headache,
tiredness, and dry cough, followed by high fever, chills, and occasionally,
diarrhea. The incubation period for legionnaires' disease is usually 2 to
10 days.
The patients identified to date all have underlying medical conditions and
range in age from 34 to 83. 5 of the 9 cases have been discharged from the
hospital and are recovered or recovering at home. The other 4 cases remain
in hospital and are in stable condition. People with chronic illnesses are
at increased risk of legionnaires' disease. The disease is rare among
children and otherwise healthy people.
"Anyone who develops fever and respiratory symptoms should contact his or
her medical provider to be evaluated," noted Dr Lipsman. Physicians have
been alerted to include testing for legionella infection in their
evaluation of appropriate patients. Specific diagnostic tests now being
performed may result in a larger number of cases than usual, since
clinicians do not routinely test for this disease.
Legionnaires' disease is most often contracted by inhaling aerosols from
water sources such as whirlpool baths, showers, and cooling towers that are
contaminated with legionella bacteria. Legionellosis is commonest during
the summer season, because warm weather promotes the growth of the bacteria
in the environment. There is no evidence that legionnaires' disease is
spread from person to person.
Recent heavy rain fall, coupled with hot, humid weather are prime
conditions for the legionella bacteria to grow and thrive. When legionella
bacteria develop in a cooling system, the mist from the system can become a
source of infection.

[To prove that the cooling tower is the source of the 12 cases of
legionellosis, it would be necessary to compare the strains from patients
and the tower for similarity. The finding, however, that each of the
infected individuals were in the area of the tower is suggestive. It is not
stated in the postings whether the affected patients had medical conditions
that would predispose them to overt legionellosis. - Mod.LL]
