Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2018: 3
Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2017: 22

Headlines
- The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on immunization (SAGE) Polio Working Group recently met in Geneva, Switzerland, to review global progress against polio. The group reviewed and endorsed the main elements of the Post-Eradication Strategy (PCS) currently being developed at the request of Member States, aimed at ensuring the availability of core functions to sustain a polio-free world after global certification (such as outbreak response capacity, surveillance, immunization and containment). The PCS will be presented in April [2018] to the full SAGE and to Member States at the World Health Assembly (WHA) in May [2018]. The group also reviewed current outbreak response protocols to vaccine-derived poliovirus, and agreed with a proposed plan to harmonize recommendations on immunization schedules in countries with Polio Essential Facilities (PEFs - facilities that will continue to handle poliovirus stock under appropriate containment).

Summary of newly-reported viruses this week
- Afghanistan:
Advance notifications have been received of 2 new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1), one occurring in Kunar province, and one in Kandahar province.
3 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) positive environmental samples have been reported in Nangarhar province.
- Pakistan:
1 new WPV1 positive environmental sample has been reported in Balochistan province.
- Democratic Republic of the Congo:
2 cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) reported, 1 from Tanganyika province, and 1 from Haut Lomami province.

Afghanistan
- Advance notifications have been received of 2 new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1), one occurring in Kunar province, and one in Kandahar province.

- 3 new WPV1 positive environmental samples were reported this week in Nangarhar province, 2 in Jalalabad district, collected on [24 Feb 2918], and 1 in Behsud district, collected on [25 Feb 2018].
- Supplementary immunization days are currently ongoing, with vaccinators aiming to vaccinate children across 34 provinces using bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV). The days are synchronised with a campaign taking place in Pakistan, part of efforts to interrupt transmission of the virus across the shared border.

Pakistan
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week.
- The total number of officially reported WPV1 cases in Pakistan in 2017 remains 8. There are no cases reported in 2018.
- The most recent case (by date of onset) was reported in Zhob district, Balochistan province, with onset on [15 Nov 2017].
- 1 new WPV1 positive environmental sample was reported this week, collected in Quetta district, Balochistan province, on [13 Feb 2018].
- Supplementary immunization days are currently ongoing, with vaccinators aiming to vaccinate children across 6 provinces using bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV). The days are synchronised with a campaign taking place in Afghanistan, part of efforts to interrupt transmission of the virus across the shared border.

Nigeria
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week.
- The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 is 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017 or 2018.
- The most recent case (by date of onset) was reported in Monguno Local Government Area, Borno, with onset on [21 Aug 2016].
- Nigeria continues to implement an emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016).
- The next immunization days are planned for early April [2018], synchronized with campaigns in countries across the Lake Chad basin.
- As part of the emergency response, subnational surveillance continues to be strengthened.

Lake Chad Basin
- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno state, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto states in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin.
- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.
- These activities include efforts to vaccinate children at markets, in internally displaced persons camps, and at international borders.
- The next set of supplementary immunization days are planned for early April [2018], synchronized across countries in the Lake Chad basin.

Central Africa
- 2 new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 1 case was reported in Mulongo district, Haut Lomami province, with onset of paralysis on [16 Jan 2018], and 1 case was reported in Manono district, Tanganyika province, with onset of paralysis on [19 Jan 2018]. These are the 1st reported cases of 2018.
- In response to recent cases, the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) recently announced the cVDPV2 outbreak ongoing in the country a Public Health Emergency of National Concern.
- The Ministry of Health, supported by WHO and partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, remains fully committed to outbreak response, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) across the country, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols.
- Children living in the districts where the latest cases were reported were last targeted with mOPV2 during December [2017] vaccination days. The next campaign will take place following the completion of microplanning exercises to ensure high vaccination coverage during campaigns.
- Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.

Horn of Africa
- Circulation of vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) is confirmed in Somalia.
- 3 vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2s (VDPV2s) were isolated from 2 environmental samples collected in Hamarweyn district, Banadir province (Mogadishu), one on [4 Jan 2018], and one on [11 Jan 2018]. These latest isolates are genetically linked to previously isolated VDPV2s from 2017, collected on [22 Oct 2017 and 2 Nov 2017] from environmental samples collected from Waberi district, Banadir province. In total, 4 environmental samples (with 7 unique virus sequences) positive for cVDPV2 have been collected in Somalia between October 2017, and January 2018.
- No cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) associated with this cVDPV2 have been detected at this time - the viruses were all isolated from environmental samples.
- Surveillance for AFP cases in the area is being strengthened.
- Since detection of the initial isolates in 2017, outbreak response campaigns in line with internationally-agreed guidelines have been implemented, consisting of 2 large-scale immunization activities. A 3rd activity is planned for March 2018.
- WHO and its partners are continuing to support local public health authorities in conducting field investigations and risk assessments to more clearly assess any potential risk of circulation of the identified cVDPV2, and to continue to support the outbreak response and strengthening of disease surveillance.

Middle East
- No new cases of circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported this week.
- The total number of officially reported cVDPV2 cases in Syria in 2017 remains 74.

[It seems as though there is still ongoing transmission of the WPV in both Pakistan and Afghanistan - both having positive environmental samples, and clinical cases in Afghanistan. As for ongoing transmission of cVDPV2 - there have been 2 new clinical cases confirmed in the Congo DR, with dates of onset in January 2018 - both occurring in Provinces previously reported to have had cases during 2017 (Mulongo district, Haut Lomami province, and Manono district, Tanganyika province). In addition, there is repeated mention of the 2 environmental samples that were positive for cVDPV in Somalia, both related to viruses isolated from environmental samples in Somalia in October and November 2017.

The good news is that it is now almost 6 months since the last case of polio attributable to cVDPV2 was identified in Syria - hopefully signaling that interruption of transmission of the virus has occurred.
