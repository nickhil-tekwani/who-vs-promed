Northern Nevadans who feed wild birds might be killing them with kindness,
wildlife officials warned this week.
-----------------------------------------------
An illness birds transmit through their saliva makes bird feeders and
birdbaths prime sources for the illness to spread, one disease expert said.
That's why bird-lovers are being urged to wash their feeders and birdbaths
with a weak bleach solution and then store them until next winter.
_Trichomonas gallinae_, a one-celled parasite, causes sores that constrict
a bird's trachea and esophagus until it dies of hunger or chokes, said
Anette Rink, director of the Nevada Department of Agriculture's animal
disease laboratory.
Mourning doves and pigeons are most susceptible to the disease, but raptors
who prey on the birds also contract it, she said. Other birds, including
turkeys, chickens, quail and songbirds can catch the disease as well.
Rink said she began getting calls about doves and pigeons dying in numbers
in residents' yards in Reno and Sparks about 3 weeks ago.
Called "canker" in doves and pigeons and "frounce" in raptors, the sickness
occurs among birds periodically, but is not transmitted to humans or other
animals, Rink said.
"This one is a virulent strain," she said. "Doves and pigeons are most
susceptible, but I don't think we have enough data to say how a really
virulent strain will affect other birds. We know songbirds and waterfowl
are not as susceptible, but that could be because pigeons and doves are
more conspicuous."
Because doves and pigeons are larger birds and perch when they are ill,
they are easy to spot when they die, she said. Smaller birds tend to hide
when they are sick, she said.
The other problem is that bird feeders and birdbaths act like a magnet to
all birds, but especially sick ones that are too weak to fly in search of
food, Rink said. Mourning doves and pigeons feed on the ground, but sick
ones eventually can't swallow food or water and regurgitate them back up.
Healthy birds then eat the contaminated seeds and drink the water.
There is a drug that can be used to treat domestic birds. But Rink said
that because the amount used must be in controlled doses, there is no way
to treat the wild population.
Jacque Lowery, co-owner of Wild Birds Unlimited in Reno's Shoppers Square,
said because doves and pigeons are ground-feeders and too big to feed from
tube-shaped bird feeders, hummingbird feeders or thistle socks, they can't
infect those.
"My recommendation is don't scatter feed on the ground until this outbreak
runs its course, which is usually late winter to spring," Lowery said.
"I've advised my customers not to use platform feeders, because doves and
pigeons can sit on those, so use feeders they can't get access to."
Lowery also recommends cleaning feeders weekly with a solution that is 9
parts water to one part bleach and using a bottle brush to get inside tube
feeders. She said rinse feeders thoroughly, and let them dry before
refilling them. The same bleach solution should be used to clean birdbaths
daily.
"The most important thing is to keep feeder areas clean," she said. "Rake
the shells and hulls under the feeder up and hose the area down to dilute
feces. Spread the feeders throughout the yard so there's not a
concentration of birds in one area."
[One person] has more than a dozen bird feeders in the yard of his
southwest Reno home. "I put one feeder up and started getting kind of
exotic-looking birds, so I put up more bird feeders and learned what the
different birds eat," [he] said. "It's kind of fun," he said. "Every once
in a while, a new bird will appear, and that makes it more exciting." [he]
said he 1st heard about the disease hitting the bird population from a
neighbor and went to Lowery for advice. Now he follows her cleaning guidelines.
The Nevada Department of Wildlife still urges the removal of bird feeders
and birdbaths entirely, sanitizing them and storing them away until winter
to stop the spread of the avian disease, "This is a good time of year to
stop feeding the birds," said wildlife department spokesman Chris Healy.
"There is plenty of food around for them, and they don't need our help."
Rink agrees, adding that there also are other water sources for them. "I
know some people are pretty upset about this, but it is just a
recommendation," she said of their urging a bird feeder and birdbath
moratorium. "My feeling is, if you love them, stop feeding them right now.
It's a pretty selfish approach to say, 'Oh, but I like watching birds.' If
you're providing ways for them to become sick, you have to draw the line."

[_Trichomonas gallinae_ is a flagellated protozoan. It is not easy to
diagnose trichomonas. This disease may be confused with others that look
very similar, such as Vitamin A deficiency, candidiasis and poxvirus. In
order to distinguish the difference, oral fluids or a scraping taken from
the crop or from an oral lesion and tested by PCR can distinguish between
these diseases.
Although bird feeding is an enjoyable hobby, sanitation is essential for
the health of the birds that dine at these readily available avian
restaurants. - Mod.TG]
