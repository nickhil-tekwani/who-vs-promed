Swiss health officials fear that the country will fail to meet World
Health Organization (WHO) vaccination targets aimed at eradicating
measles in Europe. The warning comes as Switzerland grapples with a
measles outbreak, which is mainly affecting the central part of the
country and has left one in 10 victims needing hospital care.
Five years ago, the WHO regional office for Europe launched a
strategic plan to increase immunization rates to 95 percent of the
population in order to eliminate measles and rubella (German measles)
on the continent.
But while the Swiss [vaccination] rate has crept up to 86 percent
from 82 percent 3 years ago, it is still some way off the WHO
benchmark -- and a source of concern for the Federal Health Office.
"The vaccination rate in Switzerland is increasing very slowly, and
there is a worry that it is not increasing fast enough to reach this
95 percent target," Jean-Luc Richard of the health office's
epidemiology and infectious diseases division told swissinfo. "In
fact we think it is too ambitious a goal right now for Switzerland,
as it is for some other countries," he added.
The current outbreak, which the health office has classed as an
"epidemic", has seen 414 infections since January [2007], of which
more than half have occurred in the canton of Lucerne. According to
officials, vaccination coverage in this central Swiss canton is
particularly low, standing at just 78 percent. "In Lucerne there is a
higher proportion of the population that uses alternative medicine
and they tend to vaccinate less against measles," explained Richard.
In Switzerland there is no specific measles and rubella elimination
plan. But the MMR [measles, mumps & rubella triple] vaccine, which
offers basic protection against measles, mumps, and rubella, is
recommended under the Swiss vaccination plan. This is passed on to
all doctors, who have to inform parents about recommended
vaccinations, including the benefits and the risks.
People who contract measles can suffer brain damage, pneumonia, or
even die. Vaccination has, however, been linked by some experts to
autism or an increase in allergies among children. "There is no real
structured campaign for the promotion of the MMR vaccine in
Switzerland," said Richard. "But we feel there is a need."
Switzerland is not alone in struggling to reach the WHO target.
Neighboring Italy, Germany, and Austria are all in the same boat.
According to a WHO report published last year [2006], registered
vaccination coverage in Austria for the 1st MMR dose was just under
80 percent. The same report revealed that immunization coverage in
children aged 12 to 23 months in Italy was still below 70 percent.
Sergei Deshevoi, who specializes in measles and rubella elimination
at the WHO's European office, admitted that the targets were "quite
ambitious" and would take time to be met. "Unfortunately lack of
adequate immunization coverage is still a challenge in a number of
countries of the region," he said.

[Measles is an acute viral illness, which is highly contagious. The
1st sign of infection is usually high fever; after several days a
rash develops over the body. The most serious complications include
blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infections, and severe
respiratory infections, such as pneumonia. As of 2001, the MMR1
(measles, mumps, rubella vaccine 1st dose) has been recommended in
Switzerland at the age of 12 months and MMR2 at age 15-24 months.
Catch-up vaccination with 2 doses of MMR is recommended at any time
until age 40 years.
The WHO strategic plan for elimination of measles and rubella in
Europe states the following:
"Achieve and sustain at least 95 percent coverage with 2 doses of
measles and at least one dose of rubella vaccine through high-quality
routine immunization services.
Provide a 2nd opportunity for measles immunization to susceptible groups.
Provide rubella immunization opportunities to all rubella-susceptible
children, adolescents, and women of childbearing age.
Strengthen surveillance systems by rigorous case investigation and
laboratory confirmation of suspected cases.
Improve the availability of high-quality, valued information for
health professionals and the public on the benefits and risks
associated with measles and rubella immunization."
The resistance of a few to acceptance of the MMR triple vaccine in
Switzerland and several other countries is still hampering efforts to
eliminate measles from Europe. - Mod.CP]
