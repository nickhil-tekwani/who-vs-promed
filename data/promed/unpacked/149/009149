Republic of the Congo: Ebola Fever Death Toll Rises to 98
---------------------------------------------------
The death toll from the outbreak of the highly contagious Ebola virus has
risen to 98 in the Republic of Congo's Cuvette-Ouest province, near the
border with Gabon. The Health Ministry stated in a statement released at the
weekend that the total number of diagnosed cases in the outbreak has risen
to 135.
The latest outbreak, initially detected on 4 Jan 2003, is believed to have
begun when the tribal people of the region some 700 kilometres north of the
capital ate infected gorilla meat. There is no known medical cure for Ebola
hemorrhagic fever, which can kill up to 90 percent of its victims in the
case of particularly virulent strains, such as the current one. But early
treatment of associated symptoms can save some lives.

[Since the statement released by WHO on Fri 7 Mar 2003, the number of Ebola
fever cases has increased by 25 and the number of deaths by 9. The earlier
optimism that the outbreak was being contained has not been borne out..
It is worth repeating here that although "consumption" of bushmeat has been
suggested as a possible source of the outbreak, Ebola virus would be
destroyed by normal cooking procedures. The transmission of infection from
non-human primates to humans would occur most likely during hunting,
slaughtering, and butchering, when infected fluids from the animals makes
contact with cuts or abrasions on the hands of the hunters or cooks. The
report of the proceedings of the conference held in Brazzaville last week
suggested that human and non-human primates may contract infection from a
common source, and that the identity of this reservoir of Ebola virus
remains unknown. - Mod.CP/JW]
