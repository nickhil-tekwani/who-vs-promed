In Germany the highest tick activity within the last 10 years was observed in May and June this year [2018]. In a long-term study of the German Reference Laboratory for tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) at the Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology (Munich, Germany) ticks have been flagged monthly since 2009 in a TBE focus in Southern Germany. Up to now, more ticks than ever have been collected. With 530 nymphs in the standardized sampling area (total of 400 sqm within 90 minutes of sampling) in May 2018, the number was more than 25 percent higher than the so far highest numbers found in May 2016 (420 nymphs) and May 2015 (400 nymphs), the month with the highest number of ticks in the year in Germany.

So far, the observations coincide quite well with the forecasted extremely high annual tick activity in 2018 recently published by scientists of the Institute of Veterinary Public Health at the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna. Based on the long-term time series of the Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, a model was developed for forecasting the annual tick activity. As predictors the fructification of the European beech 2 years before, the mean annual temperature of the previous year, and the current mean winter temperature (December to February) are used. By the end of February, a forecast of the tick density for the upcoming year was made. The model proved to be an excellent tool for forecasting the tick activity before the start of the tick activity.

The current high tick activity is correlated with an increased number of human TBE cases in some TBE high risk districts in Southern Germany, where the current number of cases so far is higher than in the equivalent period of the previous year. Last year [2017] was remarkable with the 2nd highest number of human TBE cases ever recorded in Germany and the highest number of cases ever recorded in the Federal State of Bavaria in Southern Germany.

Due to the high tick activity, inhabitants and also visitors of TBE high-risk areas in Southern Germany (according to the Robert-Koch Institute recommendations and neighbouring countries) are encouraged to have a vaccine protection against TBE when staying in forest and coming in contact with ground vegetation. Additionally, wearing long clothes, applying repellents, and checking the body for ticks are appropriate to prevent tick bites. Ticks should be removed at once after detection.

The publication of the tick activity forecast for 2018 can be found at:

Abstract
--------
The castor bean tick, _Ixodes ricinus_ (L.) (Ixodida: Ixodidae), is the principal vector of pathogens causing tick-borne encephalitis or Lyme borreliosis in Europe. It is therefore of general interest to make an estimate of the density of _I. ricinus_ for the whole year at the beginning of the tick season. There are 2 necessary conditions for making a successful prediction: a long homogeneous time series of observed tick density and a clear biological relationship between environmental predictors and tick density. A 9-year time series covering the period 2009-2017 of nymphal _I. ricinus_ flagged at monthly intervals in southern Germany has been used. With the hypothesis that _I. ricinus_ density is triggered by the fructification of the European beech 2 years before, the mean annual temperature of the previous year, and the current mean winter temperature (December-February), a forecast of the annual nymphal tick density has been made. Therefore, a Poisson regression model was generated resulting in an explained variance of 93.4 percent and an error of RMSE [root mean square error] = 21 ticks per 100 m2 (annual MEAN=260 collected ticks/100m2). An independent verification of the forecast for the year 2017 resulted in 187 predicted versus 180 observed nymphs per 100 m2. For the year 2018 a relatively high number of 443 questing _I. ricinus_ nymphs per 100 m2 is forecasted, [that is,] a "good" tick year.

[Occurrence of human TBE cases in Germany and neighboring countries is of significant public health concern, hence, the value of a reliable predictive tool for tick population abundance in the coming transmission season. The increase in tick population, with the associated risk of TBE transmission, calls for public education in order to avoid tick bites. Although _I. ricinus_ is the major TBE virus vector, in 2016 Dr Dobler and colleagues reported the detection of TBE viral RNA in another hard tick, _Dermacentor reticulatus_ (see ProMED-mail Tick-borne encephalitis - Germany (02): Dermacentor reticulatus, human 20161014.4558823).

Presumably, the abundance of both species is predicted to increase. As noted previously, WHO states, "Approximately 10 000-12 000 clinical cases of tickborne encephalitis are reported each year, but this figure is believed to be significantly lower than the actual total. Immunization offers the most effective protection. Currently, there are 4 widely used vaccines of assured quality: FSME-Immun and Encepur, manufactured in Austria and Germany respectively, and based on European strains of the virus; and TBE-Moscow and EnceVir, manufactured in the Russian Federation and based on Far-Eastern strains. The 4 vaccines are considered to be safe and efficacious." (http://www.who.int/immunization/topics/tick_encephalitis/en/)

Tickborne encephalitis is a virus infection caused by one of 3 tickborne encephalitis virus (TBEV) subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _Ixodes_ ticks. - Mod.TY
