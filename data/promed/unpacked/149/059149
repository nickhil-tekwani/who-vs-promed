While the harvesting of wheat is expected to start in early July [2016], Russia's southern regions have already started harvesting barley.

SovEcon, a Moscow-based consultancy, said [that] the market is concerned about the quality of the new wheat crop after recent rains, and there are reports of the fungal disease fusarium in the southern regions due to excessive moisture.

[Fungal species originally classed as members of genus _Fusarium_ are involved in 2 major disease complexes of wheat: head blight, which may be accompanied by mycotoxin contamination to result in total crop loss; and root, crown, and foot rot which may also lead to seedling blight. A number of the fungi have since been reclassified into other genera, but the common names of the diseases remain. It is not specified above which of the diseases are currently of main concern in Russia.

The pathogens persist and multiply on infected crop residues, spores are spread by wind, water, mechanical means, and with infected plant material (including seeds). For seedling blights, the main pathogen source is contaminated seed. Disease management may include fungicides as crop sprays or seed treatments, long crop rotations with non-hosts, control of grassy reservoir hosts, phytosanitation, and planting of cereal varieties with reduced susceptibility. Use of certified clean seeds is essential.

New fungal strains are emerging worldwide and resistance breeding programmes are ongoing. Re-emergence of some fusarium diseases thought to be driven mainly by changes to climate and agronomic practices has been reported (for example, ProMED-mail post 20100726.2497).
