A recent outbreak of hepatitis A in Oakland County, Michigan, involved one
death and 42 other confirmed cases. The outbreak has been linked to the
coleslaw served at a West Bloomfield delicatessen. Of the 37 sick people
interviewed by health officials, 33 had eaten at the deli sometime in the
beginning of August and almost all had eaten the offending coleslaw.
The owner of the delicatessen stated that,"the outbreak has been a wake-up
call to all of the restaurateurs to reach for the highest safety standards
available." According to the owner, coleslaw will be made fresh daily and
employees have been ordered to wear disposable gloves and to wash their
hands frequently [thank God for those little signs in the rest room --es.
The number of hepatitis cases were noted by the medical epidemiologist for
the Michigan Department of Community Health, Dr.William Hill, as "unusually
high." The recent outbreak in Oakland County brought the total number of
hepatitis cases to 693, a 5-year high for the state. Over 300 of the cases
were due to an outbreak in March of this year that was traced to strawberries.
