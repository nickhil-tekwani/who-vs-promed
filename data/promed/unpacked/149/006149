American mink: _Neovison vison_ (Mustelidae) / 0.54 / 0.54 / 100 / **
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter
** Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with infected workers

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; quarantine; selective killing and disposal; disinfection; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
National Food and Veterinary Risk Assessment Institute (national laboratory)/ American mink / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 26 Nov 2020 / positive

Subscribers are encouraged to read the OIE's Questions and Answers information on COVID-19, last updated Fri 27 Nov 2020, at https://tinyurl.com/v3geqme.The following is sourced from that information:

1. What are the implications of animal infections with SARS-CoV-2?
Although several animal species have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, these infections are not the driver of the current COVID-19 pandemic which is human-to-human transmission.

However, there are valid concerns about the establishment of SARS-CoV-2 reservoirs in wild or domestic animals, which could pose a continued public health risk and lead to future spillover events to humans. Consequently, susceptible animal populations in close contact with humans should be closely monitored. The virus introduction to a new animal species might accelerate its evolution, which could potentially impact on surveillance and control strategies. Additionally, the conservation efforts might be undermined with the introduction of the virus to susceptible endangered animal populations, leading to biodiversity loss. Further investigation is needed to fully understand these risks.

More information about the SARS-CoV-2 events in animals reported by countries to the OIE can be found More information about the SARS-CoV-2 events in animals reported by countries to the OIE can be found at https://tinyurl.com/y523mu7b, last updated 30 Nov 2020.

2. What do we know about SARS-CoV-2 and mink?
Farmed mink are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and, in some cases, they have transmitted the virus back to humans. Surveillance findings in Denmark show that SARS-CoV-2 introduced into mink populations continues to evolve through viral mutation. Viral mutation also happens in human infections, but new mutations may be seen as the virus adapts to a new species. Scientific investigations have confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reintroduced from mink to humans.

The OIE acknowledges that such events could have important public health implications. There are concerns that the introduction and circulation of new virus strains in humans could result in modifications of transmissibility or virulence and in decreased treatment and vaccine efficacy. Yet, the full consequences remain unknown, and further investigation is needed to fully understand the impact of these mutations. Read more in the "OIE Statement on COVID-19 and mink" at https://tinyurl.com/y26ovnx2.

3. What precautionary measures should be taken when humans suspected or confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 are in contact with animals?
As a general good practice, appropriate and effective biosecurity measures should always be applied when people have contact with groups of animals, for example on farms, at zoos, and in animal shelters.

People who are suspected or confirmed to be infected with the COVID-19 virus should minimize close direct contact with animals, including farm, zoo or other captive animals, and wildlife.

Companion animals
-----------------
There is no evidence that companion animals are playing an epidemiological role in the spread of human infections of SARS-CoV-2.

However, as animals and people can both be affected by this virus, it is recommended that people who are suspected or confirmed to be infected with the COVID-19 virus avoid close contact with their companion animals and have another member of their household care for them. If they must look after their companion animals, they should maintain good hygiene practices and wear a face mask, if possible. Animals belonging to owners infected with the COVID-19 virus should be kept indoors in line with similar lockdown recommendations for humans applicable in the country or area. There is no justification in taking measures which may compromise the welfare of companion animals.

As a general good practice, basic hygiene measures should always be implemented when handling and caring for animals. This includes hand washing before and after being around or handling animals, their food, or supplies, as well as avoiding kissing, being licked by animals, or sharing food.

Farmed animals
--------------
Handling farmed animals susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 can carry additional risks when large numbers of animals are kept in close contact. Risk management strategies depend on the species and the circumstances under which the animals live and are cared for. Refer to the specific "OIE guidance" (https://tinyurl.com/y48sbagb) for further recommendations.

Wildlife
--------
A wide range of mammalian species may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The OIE has developed guidelines (https://tinyurl.com/y6d9jcol) for people engaged in wildlife work in the field to minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

4. What can Veterinary Services do to protect susceptible animals, such as mink?
Veterinary Services should protect animal health and welfare, and consequently public health, by implementing effective risk management measures to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between humans and susceptible animals.

Monitoring susceptible animals, such as mink and raccoon dogs, as well as humans in close contact with them, for SARS-CoV-2 infection, is also important. Active monitoring is recommended as it might be difficult to detect early infections in these animals, especially mink.

When a person infected with the COVID-19 virus reports being in contact with animals, a joint risk assessment should be conducted by Veterinary and Public Health Services. If a decision is made to test animals as a result of this risk assessment, it is recommended to use RT-PCR to test oral, nasal, and/or fecal/rectal samples. The risk assessment may also recommend to carry out a full genome sequencing of the virus isolated from animals. Measures should be taken to avoid contamination of specimens from the environment or by humans.

Animals that have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 should be kept away from unexposed susceptible animals. For further recommendations, refer to the OIE guidelines for people working with susceptible farmed animals, as well as with wild mammals in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. - Mod.CRD]
