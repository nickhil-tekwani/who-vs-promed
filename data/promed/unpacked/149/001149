SWINE DISEASES INCREASE - EUROPE

Health problems in pigs are often linked to changes in husbandry practices,
and current industry trends are causing rising concern among swine
veterinary specialists.
In the European Union (EU), and especially in the United Kingdom (UK), a
combination of legislation and pork quality assurance schemes are driving
towards more "welfare-orientated" housing systems which provide pigs with
more comfort (solid floors and bedding) and freedom of movement than the
partially or totally slatted floors, bare concrete and restricted movement
which have become very prevalent on pig farms over the last 2 decades. In
the UK, total confinement of sows in stall or tether housing has now been
banned (since January 1999).
The "welfare-friendly" housing systems now being introduced seem eminently
desirable and long overdue, but we are receiving field reports of increased
disease problems following their implementation. Young growing hogs kept on
solid floors and straw (as opposed to slatted floors) have shown increased
condemnations for infectious joint problems. Loose-housed sows, formerly
kept in stalls, have suffered problems of lameness, parasites and
vulva-biting. Coccidiosis and swine dysentery are reported to be rising
problems.
Frank Tobin of the Holmefield Veterinary Group in Yorkshire says "Keeping
sows in loose-housed systems has satisfied the welfare lobby, but the job of
managing the pregnant animal is more difficult now than when sows were
housed in stalls. In terms of the health of the breeding herd, it is
questionable whether the move to loose housing has actually improved the
overall welfare of the sow -- there are now so many more diseases and
conditions affecting sows that were easily excluded in stalls".
The field reports indicate farmers are experiencing increased difficulty in
maintaining hygiene in the new solid-floor and loose-housing production
systems. There is more opportunity for fecal-oral transmission of pathogens,
increased sharing of pathogens via large group sizes, more social stress and
sometimes an ideal environment (deep-bedded straw) for persistence and
proliferation of pathogens.
