_Listeria_ is an organism that contaminates food and can result in pregnant women going into premature labour or even losing their babies. The Conversation Africa's Health and Medicine Editor Candice Bailey spoke to Kerrigan McCarthy from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases about listeriosis and why it needs attention.

In South Africa, the 1st documented outbreaks of listeriosis were in 1977. Between August 1977 and April 1978, 14 cases were reported in the Johannesburg area. Since then, sporadic cases have occurred throughout the country. For example, between January 2015 and September 2015 7 cases were reported at a tertiary hospital in the Western Cape province.

Over the last few months the National Institute for Communicable Diseases has received reports of a marked increase in the number of cases across the country, but particularly in the Gauteng Province, South Africa's smallest but most densely populated province.

There have been 190 confirmed cases across the country. In Gauteng, the population incidence rates have increased from 2 per million to 8 per million. The highest incidence has been recorded in the City of Johannesburg at 12 cases per million. This is not as high as the number of people who get meningococcal meningitis or pulmonary tuberculosis, but the consequences are just as serious.

Of the 122 cases in Gauteng, over 60 percent are newborn babies that have been infected.

The institute is trying to establish what the source of the infection is so that measures can be put in place to prevent further cases. Mothers who have been infected with the bacteria are being interviewed and the institute is also engaging with the food service quality industry.

Outbreaks of _Listeria_ in food are common across the world. Outbreaks of listeriosis across the world present the same problem: that the source of contaminated food is difficult to identify. There are 2 reasons for this:
- firstly, the incubation period of 70 days makes it difficult to track what the patient ate and therefore to identify the contaminated food;
and
- secondly, once the food source is narrowed down, tests need to be conducted on the range of possible foods to establish which is the implicated one. Only once authorities are able to identify the source are they able implement measures to prevent further cases.

There is no vaccine or pre-exposure prophylaxis that can prevent infection. The main preventive measure is good basic hygiene, and proper, safe food preparation and storage.

Unlike most other foodborne pathogens, _Listeria monocytogenes_ can grow in refrigerated foods that are contaminated. To prevent this, fridge temperatures should be set below 4 deg C [about 39 deg F]; and freezer temperatures below -18 deg C [about 0 deg F].

Those at high risk of listeriosis should avoid: raw or unpasteurised milk, or dairy products that contain unpasteurized milk; soft cheeses like feta, goat cheese, and brie; foods from delicatessen counters like prepared salads and cold meats that have not been heated and reheated adequately; [and] refrigerated pâtés.

Additional measures include thoroughly cooking raw foods from animal sources, such as beef, pork, or poultry. Raw fruit and vegetables should be thoroughly washed before eating. And surfaces where food is prepared should be decontaminated regularly, particularly after preparing raw meat, poultry, and eggs, including industrial kitchens.

[Gauteng, one of the 9 provinces of South Africa, is the smallest and most populous, with a population of over 13 million residents, containing the country's largest city, Johannesburg, its administrative capital (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauteng).

Genotyping _Listeria_ isolates is important to identify transmission pathways. In the USA, clinical isolates of _Listeria monocytogenes_ are forwarded to state public health laboratories for genotyping, the results of which are submitted to PulseNet, the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance, to identify clusters of possibly related cases.

When PulseNet identifies a cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ patient isolates with the same molecular pattern, epidemiologists conduct a preliminary case-control analysis of food exposures reported on the Listeria Case Report from patients in the cluster to identify a common source. The genotype of clinical isolates is then compared to genotypes of food isolates to identify the source. More information in this regard from the South African outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
