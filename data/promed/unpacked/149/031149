I have read with interest the report from Portugal about the
protective effect of alcohol in a foodborne outbreak of _Salmonella
enteritidis_. I would like to add some comments, because we
explored this issue in 1994 during a _Salmonella enteritidis_
foodborne outbreak (1), and also in May 2000 during a _Salmonella
ohio_ foodborne outbreak (2).
In both episodes we tried to study whether there was a dose
response for alcohol (grams vs. glasses), or a threshold affecting
dose or type of beverage (wine and beer vs distilled liquor). It is also
possible that the role of non-volatile wine fraction must be
considered as well. (Dr. M. Daeschel, personal communication).
Age of cases and controls are not reported, but age is an important
variable in reports because of the potential bias: are very young
people (who are not drinkers) also at higher risk of illness?
Another question that arises is interaction. Interaction was
identified in this case by the classical method of OR [odds ratio] for
each stratum. Common sense may suggest another way. We
restricted the analysis to the exposed group because the protective
effect against Salmonella, if any, must be present in this subsample
(otherwise, alcohol will have only its very familiar and obvious
effects, when one is at a party...). I have calculated the relative risk
in the subsample of exposed (retrospective cohort) with data from
the Portugal outbreak: RR= 0.67 (0.50-0.91), very similar to the RR
we found, 0.71 (0.55-0.93).
One possible conclusion would be that specific alcoholic beverages
must be included on the epidemiological questionnaires for
foodborne outbreaks to learn more about this issue, and whether
such findings are present in outbreaks associated with other agents
beside Salmonella (our limited data suggest that is not the case). In
other settings, _Helicobacter pylori_ could also be affected by
alcoholic beverages (3).
Anecdotal: When we published the first paper, there was some
interest from the media. We refused the interview because of the
risk of [promoting] alcoholic beverages in Spain.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Bellido for sharing this
additional study suggesting a protective effect of alcoholic
beverages for exposure to salmonella-containing food. The
recommendation to include an alcohol consumption question on the
outbreak investigation questionnaires has merit, and we look forward
to more data becoming available from future studies. Definitely food
for thought. - Mod.MPP]
