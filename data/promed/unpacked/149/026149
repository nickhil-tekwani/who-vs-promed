Influenza update - 316 (based on data up to 13 May 2018)
--------------------------------------------------------
Information in this report is categorized by influenza transmission zones, which are geographical groups of countries, areas or territories with similar influenza transmission patterns.

Summary
-------
Influenza activity returned to inter-seasonal levels in most of the countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere. Activity increased in some countries in tropical America. In the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity increased but remained below the seasonal thresholds in most countries. Worldwide, seasonal influenza subtypes A and B accounted for approximately the same proportion of influenza detections.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 93 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from [Mon 30 Apr 2018 to Sun 13 May 2018] (data as of 2018-05-25 09:05:36 UTC). The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 80 749 specimens during that time period. Up to 4449 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 2581 (58 percent) were typed as influenza A and 1868 (42 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 888 (62.4 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 536 (37.6 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 256 (85 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 45 (15 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Source of data
--------------
The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide and publishes an update every 2 weeks. The updates are based on available epidemiological and virological data sources, including FluNet (reported by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System), FluID (epidemiological data reported by national focal points) and influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member States. Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and quality of data available at the time when the update is developed.

Health Protection Agency (HPA) has said that there have been 6669 reported cases of influenza and fever last week [week of Sun 20 May 2018].

In a press release on [Mon 28 May 2018], HPA said that the most number of weekly reports in May [2018] was 14 300.

Out of the samples HPA has taken, 69 percent of people were positive for influenza A and statistics show that the influenza A virus subtype H3N2 is currently the most common sort. An elderly person died last week [week of Sun 20 May 2018].after being infected with influenza.

Reports of dengue infections have dropped in the past 2 weeks with 96 reports in the last week.

HPA said it is working to control the spread of infection by disclosing information on treatment methods at health centers, checking if the necessary equipment exits in the centers, and spreading awareness to the public through the media.
