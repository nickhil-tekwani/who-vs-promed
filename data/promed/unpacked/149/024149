Scientists have recently found a fatal infectious bacterium in the soil of Kapasia in Gazipur for the 1st time in Bangladesh. Known as _Burkholderia pseudomalle_, this bacterium can cause melioidosis, a rare disease that leads to serious infections of lung, blood and other organs, doctors and scientists say. Since 2001, doctors of Ibrahim Medical College have detected 5 such patients, who are also diabetic. All these patients come from Mymensingh-Gazipur region, which led scientists to look for the bacteria in the area.

If melioidosis remains undiagnosed and untreated for long, chances of death are 80 percent, doctors say. Similar to tuberculosis in many ways, the disease usually requires 4 to 6 months of antibiotic treatment. Scientists and doctors say the number of people infected by the bacterium might be higher, but the germ goes undetected because of the ignorance of doctors and microbiologists about the presence of this organism. The germ may silently live in a human body for decades. It manifests its presence through various symptoms when the carrier person's immune system is damaged by diabetes, kidney failure, liver cirrhosis and AIDS.

"We have had patients who were infected by the bacterium. But we could not detect its origin. Now we have found it in the soil of Kapasia in Gazipur," said J Ashraful Haq, a professor of microbiology at Ibrahim Medical College.

Statistics on how many people in Bangladesh are infected by the bacterium are not available, said the professor, who has been conducting research to detect the germ for more than a decade. The bacterium can invade the human body through the skin and via inhalation and contaminated food, he told The Daily Star.

"Diagnosis of melioidosis is difficult, as people react differently to the bacteria. Signs of the disease range from apparently harmless abscesses to pneumonia, to blood infection," Prof Haq said. He initially detected the bacteria in a diabetic patient in 2001. In the next few years, he detected several other cases of melioidosis in diabetic patients, all coming from Mymensingh and Tangail. This led him and Shariful Alam Jilani, another professor of the same department, and Prof Chowdhury Rafiqul Ahsan and Jamshedul Alam of Dhaka University to start research to ascertain the source of the bacterium in the beginning of 2012. They finally found it in the soil of Kapasia late in July 2013.

Melioidosis is of public health importance in Thailand, Viet Nam, Malaysia, Laos, Myanmar and northern Australia, where it is associated with high fatality rates, Haq said.

[_Burkholderia pseudomallei_ exists as an environmental saprophyte living in soil and surface water in endemic areas (Southeast Asia and northern, tropical Australia), particularly in rice paddies. In endemic countries, the organism exists primarily in focal areas and is not equally distributed throughout the landscape. Sporadic cases have been reported to have been acquired in parts of Africa and the Americas. The organism may exist in a viable, non-cultivable state in the environment, interacting with other organisms, particularly protozoa, which might explain its adaptation to an intracellular niche. Two outbreaks in Australia have also implicated potable water supplies rather than surface water as a potential source of the infection.

Melioidosis is a disease of the rainy season in the endemic areas. It mainly affects people who have direct contact with soil and water. Many have an underlying predisposing condition such as diabetes (commonest risk factor), renal disease, cirrhosis, thalassemia [an inherited blood disorder], alcohol dependence, immunosuppressive therapy, chronic obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and excess kava consumption. Kava is an herbal member of the pepper family that can be associated with chronic liver disease.

Bangladesh is close to a number of Southeast Asia countries where _B. pseudomallei_ is endemic, so it is not surprising that cases occur in more susceptible hosts and that the organism has now been isolated from the soil.

Melioidosis may present at any age but peaks in the 4th and 5th decades of life, affecting men more than women. In addition, although severe fulminating infection can and does occur in healthy individuals, severe disease and fatalities are much less common in those without risk factors.

The most commonly recognized presentation of melioidosis is pneumonia associated with high fever, significant muscle aches, chest pain, and, although the cough can be nonproductive, respiratory secretions can be purulent, significant in quantity, and associated with on-and-off bright, red blood. The lung infection can be rapidly fatal -- with bacteremia and shock -- or somewhat more indolent.

Acute melioidosis septicemia is the most severe complication of the infection. It presents as a typical sepsis syndrome with hypotension, high cardiac output, and low systemic vascular resistance. In many cases, a primary focus in the soft tissues or lung can be found. The syndrome, usually in patients with risk factor co-morbidities, is characteristically associated with multiple abscesses involving the cutaneous tissues, the lung, the liver, and spleen, and a very high mortality rate of 80 to 95 per cent. With prompt optimal therapy, the case fatality rate can be decreased to 40 to 50 per cent.

_B. pseudomallei_ is usually inhibited by tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT), anti-pseudomonal penicillins, carbapenems, ceftazidime, and amoxicillin/clavulanate or ampicillin/sulbactam. Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime have good in vitro activity but poor efficacy; and cefepime did not appear, as well, to be equivalent to ceftazidime in a mouse model. The unusual antimicrobial profile of resistance to colistin and polymyxin B and the aminoglycosides, but sensitivity to amoxicillin/clavulanate, is a useful tool to consider in treatment of infection with the organism.

The randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing melioidosis treatments have been reviewed, and it was found that the formerly standard therapy of chloramphenicol, doxycycline, and SXT combination had a higher mortality rate than therapy with ceftazidime, imipenem/cilastatin, or amoxicillin/clavulanate (or ampicillin/sulbactam). The beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor therapy, however, seemed to have a higher failure rate. - Mod.LL
