Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome, probable - Uruguay 970626214613]
There have been two confirmed cases of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) in
Uruguay this year, one in March and the last one in June. They are the first
two cases reported in this country. Both have been confirmed in the
hantavirus laboratory of the Instituto "C. Malbran" in Buenos Aires,
Argentina. Both patients were males, aged 28 and 48, respectively; one died.
One case ocurred at the outskirts of the city of Montevideo in a rural area
(Rincon de Melilla) and the second was in a place 300 Km. from Montevideo at
a rice culture field (Laguna Blanca). RNA sequencing of the virus from the
first case was done at the Malbran Institute (Dra. P. Padula) and the
phylogenetic study revealed a close similarity with Andes virus [from
Argentina].

[We are most grateful to Dr. Rossi for sending these details. From the
original message we received from PanAmerican Health Organization and from
subsequent messages from Drs. Enrique Lessa, we were certain that "where
there was smoke, there was fire" but, until now did not have sufficient
details to make a reasonable posting. It will be interesting to hear whether
the vertebrate (rodent) host of this virus is _Oligoryzomys flavescens_ or
yet another rodent species to add to the ever-increasing list of rodent hosts
of hantaviruses. The question now is "Where is there NOT a hantavirus in
this hemisphere and elsewhere?" -- Mod CHC]
