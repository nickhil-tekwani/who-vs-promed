The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) on Friday [17 May 2019] confirmed this year's [2019] 1st Japanese encephalitis case, urging people to take precautionary measures against mosquito bites as the disease's peak season approaches.

A man in his 60s from Kaohsiung on 1 May [2019] started showing symptoms of fever, headache, convulsions and loss of consciousness, and was immediately hospitalized, the centers said.

He was reported as a suspected case and transferred to another hospital for further treatment on 5 May [2019], with test results on Friday [17 May 2019] confirming that he was infected with Japanese encephalitis [virus], it said. He has since slipped into a coma and is being treated at an intensive care unit, the CDC said.

The man had visited a friend in Kaohsiung's Daliao District and a natural recreational area in Fengshan District during the incubation period, CDC physician Lin Yung-ching said, adding that there is a pig farm and meat market as well as rice paddies near the places he visited, so he might have been infected there.

The Japanese encephalitis season lasts from May to October, with June and July the peak period, Lin said.

Most people show mild to no symptoms at all, but in some cases, the patient might develop a headache, fever or aseptic meningitis, which could progress to loss of consciousness, seizures and ultimately death, he said.

About 30 to 50 percent of those who survive the serious symptoms are left with permanent brain damage, muscle weakness, learning difficulties or personality changes, Lin said, adding that young children, elderly people and people with weak immune systems are at higher risk of developing serious symptoms.

Getting vaccinated is the best prevention method, the CDC said, urging parents who have children above 15 months to get vaccinated at local health departments or contracted hospitals.

People should avoid rice paddies, ponds, trenches, animal farms and other places mosquitoes inhabit, especially at dawn and dusk, when they are most active, and take protective measures against mosquito bites when going outdoors, the CDC said.

[The above case heralds the beginning of the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) transmission season that is now underway in Taiwan. We expect cases to occur sporadically until the transmission season ends in October 2019. The mosquito species, _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_, is an efficient vector of JEV and breeds in wet areas such as rice paddies. These culex mosquitoes are abundant enough there to accomplish transmission of the virus from birds and swine to people. Vector control is difficult.

Japanese encephalitis is a vaccine-preventable disease; the affected individual above had not been vaccinated. The advice to ensure that everyone be vaccinated is prudent. The only measures to prevent infection are vaccination and avoidance of mosquito bites. - Mod.TY
