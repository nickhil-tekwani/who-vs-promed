On September 8 Canadian scientists reported Ontario's first confirmed death
from a hantavirus, a woman from Owen Sound. Dr. Harvey Artsob, Head of
Zoonotic Diseases at Ottawa's Laboratory Centre of Disease Control, said
that further tests were necessary in order to determine which strain killed
the 48-year-old woman.
Along with colleague Michael Drebot, Artsob has spent the past two months
trying to confirm the conclusions of the University of Western Ontario's
Dean of Science, Yong Kang, who concluded in July that the lung tissue from
the victim showed the woman had died of the rare virus carried by deer
mice, and that the particular strain involved was Convict Creek virus,
named for its California origin.
Kang's findings startled the scientific community for two reasons: (1) It
marked Ontario's first hantavirus death and (2) it represented the first
time the Convict Creek strain had ever been isolated in Canadian deer mice.
The latter conclusion raised some skepticism because it's commonly believed
the Convict Creek strain can't exist this far north. Artsob said that
while further testing will be done, he doubts the strain will turn out to
be Convict Creek.
He stated, "We're going to look at a larger area of tissue, but I don't
believe it will turn out to be Convict Creek [virus]. What's significant
is that it is the first confirmed [hantavirus] death in Ontario ..."
Artsob said Kang will decide whether he wants to participate in further lab
tests. He also reported that a special testing lab in New Mexico, renowned
in hantavirus research could find no trace of the virus. He states, "It
could be the test wasn't sensitive enough to pick up hantavirus. But
diagnostically, we'd like to understand why the test was negative."
Dr. Murray McQuigge, medical officer of health for Bruce-Grey-Owen Sound,
said 130 rodents were trapped in the area since the Ontario woman's death.
Of those, 60 turned out to be deer mice but none was found to carry the
hantavirus. In the article, he credits the "sharpness" of local
pathologist Brian Rudrick for suspecting the woman's sudden death from
respiratory failure was caused by the virus.
However, Artsob notes that no deer mice were found in the vicinity of the
woman's home, so her source of contact remains a mystery.
McQuigge goes on to say that the confirmation of hantavirus has stirred
"significant interest" across the Province. "There's a lot more work to do.
This case [investigation] is far from over." He concluded by saying the
death has underlined the need for people to avoid sweeping anywhere that
may contain mouse droppings.
[This report has more holes than Swiss cheese. First, there is no
indication of the date of onset or date of death of the case-patient. That
C. Yong Kang reported results in July gives us some idea but not sufficient
to make us knowledgeable. Second, from the report it seems the virus was
detected in lung tissue from the victim but the report goes on the indicate
that the virus "represented the first time the Convict Creek strain had
ever been isolated in Canadian deer mice". Are there two isolates or RNA
hantapositive tissues? Third, I can't imagine the justifiably conservative
Harvey Artsob would doubt C. Yong Kang's results by saying "he doubts the
strain will turn out to be Convict Creek". Convict Creek virus was
detected in deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_) from California in studies
done by Li et al. Indeed, there was some controversy as to whether this
was the first isolate of a hantavirus associated with hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome but the name Sin Nombre virus eventually was accepted as the
prototype strain. Convict Creek and Sin Nombre are very closely related
hantaviruses but there are no data regarding the geographic distribution of
Convict Creek virus, hence my doubts as noted above. Fourth, the statement
"The latter conclusion raised some skepticism because it's commonly
believed the Convict Creek strain can't exist this far north." is a
misunderstanding or pure fabrication. There are no such data. Fifth, if
indeed this virus is Sin Nombre (Convict Creek), which is transmitted
principally by deer mice but also is known to infect other _Peromyscus_
species, perhaps the vertebrate host of the etiologic agent of this illness
was not a deer mice. Then again, one must collect many mice to find a
positive when the prevalence rate is low. 60 deer mice were tested but not
in the vicinity of the patient's home. Anyone in Canada willing to provide
something beyond a newspaper report?
This is not the first report of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Canada, of
course. -- Mod CHC]
