[This is the 2nd part of the daily update following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on selected countries of interest.

To reduce the size of these posts, there will be changes over the coming days. The tables will be reduced but are available at the source URLs and will be referred to in the summaries of daily changes for each country. Countries that have almost interrupted transmission and have been lifting restrictions (China, South Korea) and have lessons to learn as they attempt to prevent explosive 2nd waves will continue to be profiled. We will attempt to select countries from each region on a daily basis. - Mod.MPP]

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 232 248 cases, including 33 229 deaths, up by 516 cases and 87 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (28 May 2020) 24-hour change was 593 cases. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are also in decline.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country (see table at http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4829_1_file.pdf), in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 88.6% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the only province reporting more than 100 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (354). Also, 15 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (6 provinces reported no new cases), another 4 provinces reported fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases, and 1 province (Piedmont) reported more than 50 but fewer than 100 cases -- all signs of decreasing local transmission.

The top 5 provinces by cumulative case count are Lombardy, followed by Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Tuscany. The top 5 provinces by number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours are Lombardy (354) followed by Piedmont (56), Emilia-Romagna (38), Lazio (16), and Liguria (14).

Italy is now 26 days post phase 2 initial opening up, and 10 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up. All eyes are now on Italy as lockdown restrictions are phased out.

[4] Iran: 146 668 total cases, 7677 deaths
Date: Fri 29 May 2020
Source: Geo TV [edited]
https://www.geo.tv/latest/290432-iran-sees-highest-number-of-new-coronavirus-infections-in-two-months


Iran on Friday [29 May 2020] announced its highest number of new coronavirus infections in nearly 2 months and warned the Middle East's deadliest outbreak was worsening in some regions. The government has largely lifted the closures it imposed after Iran's 1st cases were confirmed in February [2020] but has been watching out for any resurgence in the number of infections.

Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said 2819 new cases were confirmed across the country in the past 24 hours, bringing the overall total to 146 668. That figure is the highest Iran has announced for a single day since [2 Apr 2020]. New infections have been on a rising trajectory ever since hitting a near 2-month low on [2 May 2020].

Jahanpour said that the virus had claimed another 50 lives over the same period, raising the overall toll to 7677.

So far, the government has reimposed a lockdown on just one province, Khuzestan, on the border with Iraq in the southwest. The province remains "red" -- the highest level on Iran's colour-coded risk scale. "The provinces of Khorasan Razavi, east and west Azerbaijan, Lorestan, Kurdistan, Kermanshah, Hormozgan and Mazandaran are also in a critical situation," Jahanpour said.

COVID-19 update 120 [data as of 29 May 2020 12:00 CET]
-----------------------------------------------------
[These data are changing daily and are hard to reconcile with data from previous dates. - Mod.MPP]

Situation in Spain:
After combining the data from both surveillance methods, in Spain, at present a total of 238 564 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 27 121 deaths have been reported to date (Table 1, Table 2, Figure 1, and Figure 2) [285 644 - Worldometer accessed at 29 May 18:00 EDT (GMT-4)].

[Given the recent changes in disease reporting by Spain, it is difficult to draw trend comparisons at this time. Only to rehash, according to the 29 May 2020 report, there were 187 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, bringing the confirmed cumulative total to 238 564, a 24-hour increase from the 182 reported on 28 May 2020. A total of 27 121 deaths are reported as of 29 May 2020, only 2 more deaths than reported 28 May 2020.

The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is now 14.79 (down from 28 May 2020, when it was 15.03), against a continual slow decrease over the past 29 days.

Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times.

In terms of absolute numbers of cases, Madrid has 68 597 cases followed by Catalonia at 58 699, Castile and Leon at 18 747, Castile-La Mancha at 17 122, and Basque Country at 13 494. In terms of population-based rates (per 100 000 population) over the preceding 14-day period, Catalonia is 1st with 39.62 followed by Madrid with 24.01, Castile and Leon at 23.71, Navarre at 19.72, and Castile-La Mancha at 19.68.

According to Table 2, of the 238 564 cases, an additional 301 cases have been hospitalized over the preceding 7 days, and an additional 11 cases were admitted to ICUs over the past 7 days. Overall, 9.2% of hospitalized patients have been admitted to ICUs.
