------------------------------------------------------------
Even in a highly vaccinated population, it should be considered that,
as measles is transmitted by the airborne route, collective
preventive measures (isolation of the source patient in an Airborne
infection isolation room, AIIR) are as crucial as individual
preventive measures (such as assessing immune status/vaccinating
exposed health care workers (HCW) or using particulate respirators).

Why the index case was "placed in a single room with anteroom in
droplet isolation. No air conditioner was in place" if "Fortunately,
measles in the index case was suspected even before the typical
clinical picture appeared"?

In the background of Guideline for Isolation Precautions (Siegel JD,
Rhinehart E, Jackson M, Chiarello L, and the Healthcare Infection
Control Practices Advisory Committee, 2007 Guideline for Isolation
Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in
Healthcare Settings, June 2007
<http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/isolation/Isolation2007.pdf> it is
clearly stated that:

I.B.3.c. Airborne transmission -- Airborne transmission occurs by
dissemination of either airborne droplet nuclei or small particles in
the respirable size range containing infectious agents that remain
infective over time and distance (e.g., spores of _Aspergillus spp_,
and _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_).

Microorganisms carried in this manner may be dispersed over long
distances by air currents and may be inhaled by susceptible
individuals who have not had face-to-face contact with (or been in
the same room with) the infectious individual.

Preventing the spread of pathogens that are transmitted by the
airborne route requires the use of special air handling and
ventilation systems (e.g., Airborne infection isolation rooms) to
contain and then safely remove the infectious agent Infectious agents
to which this applies include _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, and
rubeola virus (measles) [Bloch AB, Orenstein WA, Ewing WM, et al.
Measles outbreak in a pediatric practice: airborne transmission in an
office setting. Pediatrics 1985;75(4):676-83.] and varicella-zoster
virus (chickenpox virus).

Therefore, it is recommended that under V.D. Airborne Precautions
(Page 87) that:

V.D.1. Use Airborne Precautions as recommended in Appendix A for
patients known or suspected to be infected with infectious agents
transmitted person-to-person by the airborne route (e.g., _M.
tuberculosis_, measles, chickenpox, disseminated herpes zoster. Category IA/IC

V.D.2. Patient placement

- V.D.2.a. In acute care hospitals and long-term care settings, place
patients who require Airborne Precautions in an Airborne infection
isolation room that has been constructed in accordance with current
guidelines. Category IA/IC

- V.D.2.a.i. Provide at least 6 (existing facility) or 12 (new
construction/renovation) air changes per hour.

- V.D.2.a.ii. Direct exhaust of air to the outside. If it is not
possible to exhaust air from an Airborne infection isolation room
directly to the outside, the air may be returned to the air-handling
system or adjacent spaces if all air is directed through HEPA filters.

- V.D.2.a.iii. Whenever an Airborne infection isolation room is in
use for a patient on Airborne Precautions, monitor air pressure daily
with visual indicators (e.g., smoke tubes, flutter strips),
regardless of the presence of differential pressure sensing devices
(e.g., manometers).

- V.D.2.a.iv. Keep the Airborne infection isolation room door closed
when not required for entry and exit.

- V.D.2.b. When an Airborne infection isolation room is not
available, transfer the patient to a facility that has an available
Airborne infection isolation room. Category II.
