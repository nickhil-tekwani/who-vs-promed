Recently, I disseminated a fact sheet regarding cattle imported to Texas
from Germany prior to the l997 ban on animals and meat products from Europe,
due to BSE and/or questionable feed practices. I wanted to update you on
this situation and am forwarding this media advisory issued yesterday by
Diane Oswald of the College of Veterinary Medicine.
MEDIA ADVISORY FROM College of Veterinary Medicine, TX A&M University
Thu 5 Apr 2001, 16 cattle imported from Germany in 1996, before diagnosis
of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in that country, will be
transported to the College of Veterinary Medicine at Texas A&M
University. They will be euthanized for subsequent testing for BSE. The
animals will be processed in a restricted area. Brain tissue from each
animal will be sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames,
Iowa for BSE testing. These actions are precautionary measures monitored by
United State Department of Agriculture veterinarians as part of the
National BSE Surveillance Program. None of these animals has shown any sign
of BSE, commonly known as "mad cow" disease.
"The quarantine and testing of imported cattle has been in place for a
number of years as a precautionary measure against BSE," said H. Richard
Adams, Dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine at Texas A&M. Although
there has been nationwide BSE testing for nearly a decade, the disease has
not been diagnosed in any U.S. cattle. Strict preventative measures, such
as those being used with the cattle imported from Germany into Texas, are
in effect to ensure public safety. The carcasses of the animals will be
incinerated and none of the meat will enter the food chain. BSE is not a
highly contagious disease, and can only be transmitted by ingestion.
The USDA has banned since 1989 the importation of cattle from countries
where BSE has occurred, and from countries that have feeding practices that
put animals at risk of exposure to the disease.

[We contacted Dr. Gary Svetlik, the USDA veterinarian in charge of the
project in Texas, concerning the status on these cows. He replied as follows
with the results:
Just an update. I received all the test results from NVSL today. All the
German Imports we have tested to date are negative. We will continue to try
to acquire the remaining 3 animals. One of the 3 has been committed to be
sold to us for diagnostic purposes in about 45 days.
[Concerning the "remaining 3 animals" ... One of the producers imported 4
head of animals. He sold one animal for diagnostic purposes and agreed to
sell another one in about 45 days. He does not want to sell the remaining 2
animals. We will discuss this with him again and continue to keep the
remaining animals under surveillance. They are currently under a "Hold
Order" (quarantine) and are being monitored every 90-120 days by a field
USDA veterinarian. The owner is also instructed to report any health
problems and especially anything which may suggest that the animal is
showing clinical signs of BSE. In such a case we would immediately
re-examine the animals.
