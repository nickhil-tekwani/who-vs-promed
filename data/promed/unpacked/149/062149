[Iran may represent a hotspot for HPAI virus introduction, dissemination, and for the generation of new genetic variability. This is supported by recent evidence (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104342).

The Black Sea/Mediterranean flyway runs through the northern Iranian territory and may contribute to spread westwards. Poultry trade must also be taken into account. - Mod.PMB
