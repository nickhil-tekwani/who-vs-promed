Subject: Paralysed cats update
A while ago I reported a mysterious outbreak of paralysis, probably
caused by dry catfood.
This week the committee investigating the cause published an interim
report. An extensive search for bacterial or chemical contamination
(including bacterial toxins such as botulism, mycotoxins, heavy metals,
organophosphates etc.) was negative. The only contamination found were
three coccidiostatics, but they were just above detection level.
Pathology showed a primar axonopathy with secundary destruction of the
myelinsheath.
Expiriments in rats and mice yielded no results.
At this moment there are still a few possibilities:
- The low incidence (1% of all cats receiving the offending food became
ill) suggests that the agent is present in low concentrations or is not
evenly distributed through the food (this is considered unlikely).
- It is possible several agents are interacting.
- The agent could become active only after biotransformation.
The committe is now looking for suitable lab model by trial and error.
Because of the low incidence and ethical problems cats were not considered
to be suitable test-animals.

Have you thought about hypokalaemia as a cause of your paralysis. I
have seen lots of cats that respond to K+ supplements with generalised
weakness and paralysis. Some commercial foods cause the urine pH to be
too high and promote loss of K+ ions and thus clinical hypokalaemia. It
can come on very quickly but in it must take some time to deplete total
body k+ reserves.
