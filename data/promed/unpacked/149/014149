Raccoon parasite investigation
------------------------------
Santa Barbara County Public Health Department (SBCPHD) and health and
safety officers [from the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB)]
have begun an investigation into the illness of an 11 month old child who
was admitted to Cottage Hospital with a possible rare parasitic raccoon
roundworm infection. UCSB health and safety officials, in cooperation with
SBCPHD, County Animal Services, and state public health officials are
working together to pinpoint the source of the parasite infection.
UCSB Environmental Health and Safety are identifying potential contaminated
areas and are cleaning them up. State health and laboratory officials have
initiated an on-site investigation. A response team of experts has been
formed for ongoing response. Information meetings are being planned for
next week. Medical professionals and public health practitioners are
monitoring the progress of the child and are working with the family to
offer support.
The very small number of reported raccoon roundworm infections in humans,
despite the large number of raccoons living in close association with
humans, suggests that the risk of infection is rare and remote.
Nevertheless, parents should be informed about the potential for infection
and the need for proper precautions: avoid direct contact with raccoons,
especially their feces. Do not keep, feed, or adopt raccoons as pets!
Raccoons are wild animals.
Discourage raccoons from living in and around your home or parks by
removing access to food. Clear brush so raccoons are not likely to make a
den on your property. Stay away from areas and materials that might be
contaminated by raccoon feces. Raccoons typically defecate at the base of
or in raised forks of trees, or on raised horizontal surfaces such as
fallen logs, stumps, or large rocks. Raccoon feces also can be found on
woodpiles, decks, rooftops, and in attics, garages, and haylofts. Feces
usually are dark and tubular, have a pungent odor (usually worse than dog
or cat feces), and often contain undigested seeds or other food items.
To eliminate roundworm eggs, raccoon feces and material contaminated with
raccoon feces should be removed carefully and sent to a landfill. Care
should be taken to avoid contaminating hands and clothes. Prompt removal
and destruction of raccoon feces will reduce the risk of exposure and
possible infection. Newly deposited eggs take at least 2-4 weeks to become
infective.

[Less than 30 cases in all have been reported from the United States. The
parasite is commonly known as raccoon roundworm (_Baylisascaris procyonis_)
and lives in the digestive tract of raccoons. The microscopic eggs are
found in raccoon feces. The eggs must mature to be infective stage, which
takes 2 to 4 weeks, before they can infect humans. Young children and
toddlers may be more likely than adults to ingest the eggs due to their
propensity to put dirt and other objects into their mouths. - Mod.EP]
