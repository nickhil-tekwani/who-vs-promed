There are fears of another horse flu outbreak after tests on a horse
in Sydney's west.

A horse is being tested again today [25 Sep 2008] to confirm whether
it has the disease after earlier separate tests returned both
positive and negative results.

NSW Primary Industries Minister Ian Macdonald said there was serious
concern the devastating disease was returning to Australia after the
tests on the horse at the quarantine centre at Eastern Creek.

It is just over a year since an outbreak of equine influenza (EI)
crippled the racing industry in NSW, Mr Macdonald said.

"To be quite honest, I was very worried because a national
standstill, particularly at this time of the year, if it had got out
of Eastern Creek, would be devastating," Mr Macdonald told reporters in Sydney.

The news follows a recommendation by Mr Macdonald for voluntary
vaccinations of all horses in NSW.

He detailed his views this morning [25 Sep 2008] during a speech to a
national summit of industry experts to address the management and
prevention of EI.

The decision on compulsory vaccinations should be left to individual
sectors within the horse industry, he said.

"Say the racing sector; that could determine its rules in terms of
whether a horse is vaccinated or not in attending an event," Mr Macdonald said.

"Each sector would have the ability to impose its own rules."

Last year's [2007] EI outbreak resulted in a government review of the
systems at Eastern Creek's quarantine facility, where the disease
originated, and led to horses throughout NSW and in Queensland being infected.

The outbreak halted racing in NSW and Queensland for 3 months and
shut down the multimillion-dollar horse breeding industry.

Mr Macdonald said even the best procedures might not be enough to
contain another outbreak.

"There are great upgrades in place there now, and, hopefully, it
could be contained," he said.

"But I believe that system failure is with us right around the world,
that the best walls often are breached and maybe we need to look at
other measures to ensure we never have a standstill again in the industry."

Racing NSW chief executive Peter V'Landys said another outbreak would
cripple the industry, as it did just over a year ago.

"If it's got out again, it's going to cost tens of millions of
dollars," Mr V'Landys told reporters today [25 Sep 2008] at a
national summit on EI in Sydney. "40 000 people who earn a living in
racing directly or indirectly will be out of work again. It will have
devastating consequences. It was catastrophic last year [2007], and
it has the potential to be catastrophic again."

The summit has heard differing views from industry experts on whether
NSW should implement compulsory vaccinations against EI.

Mr V'Landys said the majority of horses were in the recreation
sector, and the level of vaccination should be determined by each
segment of the industry. "But the thoroughbred code wants to and
wishes to vaccinate," he said. "It should be optional; it should be
voluntary, and we want to do it."

Equine influenza [EI], the virus that almost crippled the racing and
breeding industries a year ago, may not have been eradicated.

Even if it has, experts claim there is a significant risk of it
returning, bringing the racing industry to its knees, if Australia's
100 000-plus thoroughbreds are not vaccinated by the end of the year [2008].

The last reported case of EI was on Christmas Day last year [2007].

Two international experts, Australia's leading breeder John Messara
and former Federal Minister for Agriculture Peter McGauran, who
implemented the AUD 234 million [USD 195 million] EI assistance
package, will claim at an EI summit in Sydney tomorrow [24 Sep 2008]
that non-vaccination would put the industry in jeopardy.

They say there is no guarantee EI has been wiped out, a view
dismissed by Victoria's chief veterinary officer, Dr Hugh Millar.

"No chance ... it's completely gone," said Millar, who also dismissed
claims Australia was prone to another outbreak.

The federal government estimated that last year's [2007] EI outbreak
cost the racing and breeding industries more than AUD one billion
[USD 835 million]. It wiped out the Sydney spring carnival and went
close to devastating the breeding industry.

State chief veterinary officers, bio-security, racing and quarantine
officials, and representatives of various horse groups will debate
the vaccination issue tomorrow [24 Sep 2008]. State governments will
decide in November 2008 whether to vaccinate.

McGauran, now chief executive of Thoroughbred Breeders Australia,
said there was no guarantee EI did not exist in far-flung horse
populations. Dr David Powell, a leading equine vet with the
University of Kentucky, agreed, adding there was a remote chance EI
could again infiltrate the valuable thoroughbred population, possibly
from wild brumbies or other unchecked horses, in years to come.
"While unlikely, there is some possibility," he said.

Asked if he believed EI could still exist here, Messara said: "Absolutely."

McGauran, Messara and Powell said the global increase in horse
movement meant Australia was at further risk from EI, despite
tightening of quarantine since the outbreak. "We're tempting fate to
not believe EI will return in the future," McGauran said.

Messara, owner of Arrowfield Stud in the Hunter Valley and chairman
of breeding body Aushorse, added: "We cannot entirely rule out the
risk of human or systemic failure. In other countries, it has
returned when they haven't vaccinated."

Messara said the prospect of another outbreak was "too bad to
contemplate". "If it had gone on, the industry may not have survived.
That's how close we came."

Inoculation of Australia's horse population would cost AUD 10-15
million [USD 8.4-12.5 million], according to Messara, an annual flu
shot of about AUD 150 [USD 125] a horse.

Those against vaccination, including some state chief veterinary
officers and non-thoroughbred horse industries, such as equestrian
and standardbred, say it masks signs of EI.

They also argue that the disease has been eradicated and that the
lines of defense, including vastly more stringent quarantine, are
close to foolproof.

[Certainly, the diagnostic test will be performed several times as
well as samples likely being sent to another laboratory for
confirmation. The country is facing some regulatory challenges
whether to vaccinate or not. The racing industry is a congregation of
horses, and if the disease presents a risk, then vaccination may be a
good choice. - Mod.TG]
