In Ukraine 11 500 people have contracted measles this year
----------------------------------------------------------
According to the Ukrainian Ministry of Health, the Sanitary-Epidemiological Service has recorded 11 427 cases of measles in Ukraine between 1 Jan 2012 and 6 Jul 2012, plus another 37 suspected cases recorded on 5 Jul 2012. Most of these new cases of measles cases were reported in the western regions of Ukraine. 14 cases were recorded in the Ternopil region, 6 in the Carpathian region, and 4 in the Ivano-Frankivsk region. But no suspected cases of measles were recorded last night in the city of Kiev. According to the Sanitary-Epidemiological Service 11 406 cases of measles were recorded in Ukraine between 1 Jan 2012 and 5 Jul 2012. Between January and March 6403 cases were recorded.

The Sanitary-Epidemiological Service predicts the total number of cases of measles in 2012 will approach 18 000. One reason for the outbreak in Ukraine, according to the Sanitary-Epidemiological Service, has been importation of infection from other regions of Europe where measles has been widespread in recent times. In 2010 only 39 cases of measles were recorded in Ukraine.

[A more likely reason for the present high incidence of measles in Ukraine is past deficiencies in the provision of comprehensive vaccine coverage throughout all regions of UKraine.

Measles cases rise in parts of Mansehra
---------------------------------------
MANSEHRA: Two children have died of measles and several others are being treated for the disease in Torghar district, a health department official said on Saturday [30 Jun 2012]. Speaking at a press conference on Saturday, executive district officer (EDO) of health Torghar, Dr Mohammad Idrees said measles cases had been reported in Daray, Zamlay, Larri and Todum villages where medical teams had been sent.

The National Research and Development Foundation (NRDF) country coordinator Maulana Waseeur Rehman and district coordinator Mohammad Zubair also spoke on the occasion. Dr Idrees said two teams headed by Dr Zahid were treating the affected children and administering vaccines to the normal kids.

The EDO said there was no disease early warning system in Torghar where only nine basic health units existed in the past but later two were destroyed in the 2005 earthquake. He said nine medical technicians were recently appointed for vaccination of children in the district.

"There is no rural health centre there and no routine vaccination of children is carried out in the area. That is why the measles broke out inthe district," said Dr Idrees.

Health dept investigates measles case
-------------------------------------
The New Mexico Department of Health is investigating a [single] case of measles with contacts in both Rio Arriba and Taos counties, according to a department news release. The department's Scientific Laboratory Division confirmed the case in a 9 year old girl who was not immunized against the disease and is the first confirmed measles case in New Mexico since February 2011, the release said.

"We are working with the patient's family to identify people who may have been exposed so we can prevent more cases of the disease," Health Department secretary Dr Catherine Torres said in the release. "This case should serve as a reminder to all of us to keep our immunizations up to date, especially when it comes to children. Immunizations are the best tool we have to protect people from serious and potentially life-threatening diseases."
