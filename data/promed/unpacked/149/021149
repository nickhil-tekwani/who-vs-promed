The Canadian Food Inspection Agency [CFIA] confirmed on Monday [17
Nov 2008] a new case of mad cow disease (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, BSE) in a 7-year-old dairy cow born well after Ottawa
banned feed practices thought to spread the disease. It is the
country's 15th case. The animal was discovered on a farm in the
Pacific province of British Columbia.

The agency said no part of the animal's carcass entered the human
food or animal feed supply. It also added that regulators are also
tracking down other animals in the cow's herd when it was born.

Canada has been deemed a "controlled risk" country for mad cow
disease by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) because of
its surveillance and control measures. The CFIA said the new case
should not affect that classification.

Bovine spongiform encephalopathy or mad-cow disease emerged first in
British cattle. It is deadly and has an unusually long incubation
period of around 4 years. It also appears rarely in humans under a
different form, called new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD or nvCJD).

The disease has already killed almost 200 people in Britain. It is
unclear if the disease is transmitted to humans through consumption
of infected meat, but this is the most likely path. The cattle in
Britain get it from being fed the remains of other infected cows. The
misfolded protein called a prion, which carries the disease, is much
more resistant to heat than common viruses or bacteria, and it is
generally believed that normal cooking processes do not destroy it.

Even though its human form is the most common human prion disease, it
is still rare and only occurs in about one out of every one million
people (except if you live in Britain). In more than 85 percent of
cases, the duration of the disease between onset of symptoms and
death is less than 1 year (median: 4 months). It is incurable and fatal.

[Although feeding of mammalian tissue back to cattle is believed to
be the method inducing BSE, there is evidence that there are several
forms of the disease. One of those forms is a sporadic form, which
does not seem to be related to mammalian tissue in the feed. Banning
the mammalian tissue in feed is frequently referred to as the "feed ban."

This may be one of the sporadic forms. - Mod.TG
