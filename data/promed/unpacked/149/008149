Laudos confirms cases of Chagas disease in Amapa
------------------------------------------------
According to information from the Epidemiology Service of the State
Secretariat of Health, 26 persons residing in the locality of Igarape da
Fortaleza have been infected [with the organism responsible for Chagas
disease]. The community is located between Macapa [the capital of the State
- Mod.MPP] and the municipality of Santana, at the margins of the Salvador
Diniz highway in the western region of Amapa.
Blood samples were collected from residents in February [2005], but the
results of tests were held back by the Secretariat of Health. Despite the
high number of infected individuals, the Division of Epidemiology has
discarded the possibility of an outbreak of the disease in Amapa. According
to the Division of Epidemiology, there isn't an outbreak because the focus
[of infections?] is centered in 2 places, Igarape da Fortaleza and
Marabaixo, communities on the periphery of the city where 3 people of the
same family are infected.
According to the Chief of the Division of Epidemiology of the State
Secretariat of Health, Clovis Omar Miranda, the epidemic doesn't exist
because the barbeiro [the triatomid bug], the insect vector of the disease,
has not been found. "Therefore, we affirm that these cases are accidental
[sporadic?]. An example [of this accidental contamination] is [seen in]
the situation in Santa Catarina. Here in Amapa, where infection is being
transmitted in the classical way, that is, with the patient being bitten by
a mosquito", said Miranda.
He [Miranda] clarified that the infection of the patients from Amapa was
via food ingestion. Studies performed by technicians from the Evandro
Chagas Institute confirmed that the "acai", a fruit consumed on a large
scale in the State, is serving as the means of transmission of the disease.
The transmission is occurring at various stages in the manipulation of the
fruit, from the time of collection to the time of preparation of the juice.
Miranda said that the insect [triatomid bug] could be ground together with
the acai or that its feces could be mixed in the juice sold for consumption.
All of the infected individuals are receiving medical attention, supervised
by a technical team from Sanitary Surveillance. In addition to the already
confirmed cases, the Secretariat of Health is awaiting results from tests
on 4 suspected cases who are residents of the protected area (APA) in
Igarape da Fortaleza.

[This is an outbreak apparently completely unrelated to the previous
outbreak reported from Santa Catarina state. The statement that this
accumulation of cases is not an outbreak because 2 communities --
apparently not far apart -- are involved, is difficult to accept. A sudden
accumulation of cases in 2 nearby areas must be regarded an an outbreak.
Only careful histories from patients and controls living in the same
communities can help identify the source of the outbreak.
The message states that the triatomid bug is absent from the communities,
but this needs to be confirmed. The previous outbreak in Santa Catarina
State was probably due to sugar cane contaminated with triatomid bug feces,
which indicates that the infection can be transmitted by food contaminated
elsewhere, for instance, food collected from farms or forests. - Mod.EP]
