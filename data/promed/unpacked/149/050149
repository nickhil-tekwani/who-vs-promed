From: "J.E. van Steenbergen" <jim@lci.lcr.nl>

Fri 19 Mar 1999
Reported to the LCI up to today 16.00 hrs
Confirmed cases 91 (86 hospital admissions, 7 deaths)
Probable cases 108 (86 hospital admissions, 6 deaths)
Still expecting more data. No big news from bacteriological investigations
yet. One (experimental!) PCR on a specimen taken from a bubblebath is
positive. No clues yet from the case control.

[Is it a coincidence that the numbers of hospital admissions are the
same for both confirmed & probable cases? And isn't it strange that
no associated cases have been reported from other countries? Europe
has an efficient Internet-connected working group on legionellosis
