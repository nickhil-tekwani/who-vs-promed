On 27 Dec 2011 _Bacillus anthracis_ was cultivated from a metacarpal
sample from a herd of 64 Aberdeen Angus cattle, located in the Partido
de Trenque Lauquen (Beruti), close to National Highway 5. An animal
had died with signs of elevated temperature.

The veterinarian carrying out the necropsy noted blood extravasation
from the natural openings of the carcass and splenomegaly. There is a
local history of livestock anthrax in relation to this lake. The herd
had been vaccinated with Sterne more than 90 days previously. The area
adjoining the lake was fenced off using an electric fence, as it was
regarded as a "Champs maudit" (accursed field) because of anthrax
cases related to grazing on it in previous years.

There were no human cases. The carcass was burnt. Animals with
symptoms were treated with long-acting penicillin [to stop any
incubating infections]. The _B. anthracis_ recovered was sensitive to
Penicillin, Ciprofloxacin, Florfenicol, Tetracycline, Gentamicin, and
resistant to Trimethoprim and Sulfamethoxazole.

[Northern latitude subscribers should remember it is mid-summer in
Argentina at this time.

To see the anthrax annual reports for Argentina, go to
http://www.laboratorioazul.com.ar/LaboratorioAzul/Carbunclo/Carbunclo.aspx,
which has maps showing where outbreaks have occurred in previous
years. The previous outbreaks in Trenque Lauquen were over 5 years
ago. Proximity to the lake in hot weather would assure grazing and
thus exposure to badly contaminated ground.

When faced with this threat, the normal solution is regular annual
vaccination until time has removed the spores; this can be speeded up
by growing forage and grain crops in the area. The Argentine vaccines
have provided uncertain protection, as appears to be the case in this
outbreak, the reason for which has evaded clarification. These are
grass-fed beef herds, not dairy herds, and therefore should not be
exposed to antibiotics.
