WEST NILE VIRUS UPDATE 2002 - USA (08)

[Note: Now that West Nile virus infection is endemic throughout much of the
Eastern seaboard of the United States (see: West Nile virus - USA 2001:
final report 20020613.4491), most reports on West Nile virus infection in
year 2002 will be combined and presented as an "update" at regular, but not
more frequent than weekly, intervals determined by the volume of such
reports. As previously, however, reports of human infection, infection of
new hosts, extension of geographical range and events of special
significance will be posted immediately on receipt.
As of Sun 23 Jun 2002, the USGS/CINDI West Nile virus National and State
Maps <http://cindi.usgs.gov/hazard/event/west_nile/west_nile.html> are not
available and it is not possible to provided a summary of the overall
situation. Furthermore compiling cumulative numbers of West Nile
virus-positive birds will become increasingly less meaningful as already 3
states have decided to cease diagnosis of dead birds after initial
confirmation of the presence of West Nile virus in a county.
Since the last update the only significant extension of the range of West
Nile virus has been the appearance of the virus in Texas. - Mod.CP]

Tennessee: First Report of West Nile Virus-positive Birds for 2002
------------------------------------------------------------------
The Tennessee Department of Health has verified the first evidence of West
Nile virus (WNV) in Tennessee this year in 3 blue jays found in Shelby
County. The virus made its initial debut in Tennessee in Sep 2001, also in
Shelby County, and was subsequently identified in Greene, Humphreys and
Rutherford Counties.
Once the virus has been detected in a rural county, town, or major sector
of a metropolitan area, further testing of dead birds is discontinued since
it serves no useful purpose.
Tennessee was one of 28 states where WNV was seen last year, with the virus
turning up in 46 birds and one horse. Tennessee has had no human cases of
West Nile Virus
[On Fri 21 Jun 2002, WKRN.COM
<http://www.wkrn.com/Global/story.asp?S=828927&nav=1ugB9jKy> reported that
another blue jay collected on 10 Jun 2002 in Davidson County has tested
positive. - Mod.CP]

Ohio Becomes State with Greatest Number of West Nile Virus-positive Birds
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
State health officials confirmed on Fri 21 Jun 2002 that West Nile virus
had infected 2 dead birds found in Stark County a few weeks ago. So far, no
humans or horses have been affected, but 22 birds around the state have
tested positive this year. "Ohio has the dubious distinction of leading the
nation in the number of (infected) birds found," said Bob Somrak,
environmental health director for the Stark County Health Department.
West Nile virus arrived in the United States 3 years ago in New York
City... It first was detected in Ohio in August [2001] in a Lake County
blue jay. By the end of last summer, the virus had been detected in 54 blue
jays and 226 crows throughout the state.

The Illinois Department of Public Health today reported that a dead blue
jay found on 17 Jun 2002 in Carbondale in Jackson County has tested

reported in Clark (1), Cook (3), Edgar (2), Kane (2) and Vermilion (1)
counties.
No human cases of West Nile encephalitis have been reported in Illinois.

Lake, McHenry & Will) tested positive for the virus last year. In addition,

The first pool of Ohio mosquitoes to test positive for West Nile virus
(WNV) in 2002 has been confirmed, the Ohio Department of Health (ODH)
announced today. The positive mosquitoes were found in a trap set on 28 May
2002 in Garfield Heights, Cuyahoga County, according to Dr. Richard Berry,
chair of Ohio's WNV Workgroup and chief of ODH's Vector-borne Disease
Program. The trap contained 919 _Culex_ mosquitoes and the virus was
detected in a pool of 50 of them, he said. Prior to today's results, only
New Jersey had found WNV in a mosquito pool in 2002.
