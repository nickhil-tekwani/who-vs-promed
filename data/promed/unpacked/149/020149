After an interval, a new human rabies casualty has been recorded in
Buleleng. The victim is a resident of Seririt who died in Buleleng
General Hospital on Sunday [30 Oct 2011]. The man is a suspected
rabies victim because he was bitten by a dog 4 months ago and had not
received post-exposure prophylaxis.

According to a doctor in charge of the Padma Ward, Singaraja Hospital,
the patient arrived at the hospital on Saturday [29 Oct 2011] in
critical condition. The patient was anxious and coughing, with
salivation and a high temperature. He was also admitted suffering from
hydrophobia.

On arrival at Singaraja General hospital, the patient was taken
immediately to the Emergency Room before finally being transferred to
an isolation room. Blood samples were taken for laboratory analysis
and sent to the Denpasar [Health authority] to confirm the clinical
diagnosis.

According to his family, 4 months ago, the victim had been bitten on
his hand by a dog. However, at that time, he didn't seek rabies
post-exposure treatment. Lately, fewer people have been seeking
post-exposure treatment, perhaps because they are assuming rabies is
less prevalent because recently fewer people have been bitten by
dogs.

[The Bali Animal Welfare Association's translation describes the death
of the 1st human rabies victim in Bali to be individually identified
since a 16-year-old victim died on 5 May 2011.

Officially, there have been 148 human rabies deaths in Bali since
November 2008. The outbreak still smolders on despite systematic
efforts to control canine rabies in the island.

Buleleng is physically and culturally the "other side of Bali." Long
isolated from the south by the central volcanic ridge and vast expanse
of primary forest, it has developed unique social and cultural
features. The Buleleng regency stretches across almost the whole of
the northern part of Bali. The area generally consists of steep
mountain slopes plunging down into a narrow coastal plain. It can be
located in the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at:
