Suspected Norwalk-like virus outbreak; over 170 sick on cruise ship
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A Carnival cruise ship returned from a 3 day voyage on Mon 2 Dec 2002
carrying more than 170 people sickened by a gastrointestinal virus, with
symptoms similar to those plaguing other cruise liners. A total of 171
passengers and 4 crew members on the "Fascination" reported vomiting and
diarrhea, but experts have not yet confirmed whether they had a
Norwalk-like virus, said Tim Gallagher, a Carnival Corp spokesman.
Norwalk-like viruses have affected over 1000 people on other cruise ships
in the past few months, including Holland America Line's Amsterdam and
Disney Cruise Line's Magic, causing those companies to cancel one sailing
each to thoroughly disinfect the ships.
The illness is seasonal, peaking in the colder months, and is not uncommon,
said Dr Steven Wiersma, the state epidemiologist. "We've already seen some
(cases) in Florida. This is not just a cruise ship issue," he said. Wiersma
said it was too early to tell whether the recent outbreaks represent a
[peak] in occurrences, since more people are reporting being sick because
of the increased attention given to the cruise ship cases.
The 855 foot Fascination carried 2428 passengers and more than 900 crew
members on its 3 day voyage to the Bahamas. The federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) was overseeing the cleaning of the ship, which
was still scheduled for a late afternoon sailing on a 4 day cruise to Key
West and Cozumel, Mexico, Gallagher said.
Norwalk virus, named after an outbreak 30 years ago in Norwalk, Ohio, and a
group of Norwalk-like viruses are among several common microorganisms that
can cause diarrhea, stomach pain, and vomiting for 24 to 48 hours,
according to CDC. They are spread through food and water and close contact
with infected people or things they have touched. The incubation period is
about 2 to 3 days.
The Amsterdam, which was held at Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale for 10
days to be disinfected, departed on a 10 day Caribbean cruise on Sunday
with 1261 passengers. "We are very confident that we have broken the
cycle," said Rose Abello, a Holland America spokeswoman. "Can we guarantee
that nobody will ever get sick? Absolutely not."
Disinfecting the Amsterdam included steam-cleaning drapes, furniture,
cushions, and 300 000 square feet of carpet, and even disinfecting poker
chips. Passengers on other Holland America ships, the Ryndam and Statendam,
have also contracted the Norwalk-like virus on recent cruises. Holland
America Line Inc also is owned by the Miami-based Carnival Corp.

[It is unclear from these reports of independent outbreaks on different
cruise ships whether there has been laboratory confirmation of the identity
of the organism in all cases, or whether the same species/strain of
Norwalk-like virus is responsible. Some clarification would be appreciated.
