Yellowing disease of melon in Sardinia (Italy) caused by beet pseudoyellows
virus
----------------------------------------------
L Tomassoli <virologia@ispave.it>, V Lumia, M Barba (Istituto Sperimentale
per la Patologia vegetale, via CG Bertero 22, I-00156 Roma, Italy), GF
Siddu (ERSAT - Centro Zonale di Arborea, Corso Italia 2, I-09092 Arborea
(CA), Italy).
In 2001, a disease of melon characterized by leaf yellowing was observed in
Sardinia (Italy), where it caused severe damage. Samples collected from
several melon crops were positive in single step reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for beet pseudoyellows virus
(BPYV) when specific primers were used. An amplicon of the same size as
that from BPYV controls (450 bp) was obtained from 14 out of 20 samples
tested and had 98.4 per cent nucleotide sequence identity with an authentic
BPYV sequence.
This is the first experimental evidence of a yellowing disease caused by
BPYV in Italian melon crops.

[This piece is posted as a record of occurrence of BPYV in Sardinia.
According to Laura Tomassoli, BPYV infected melon crops in glasshouses
(_Cucumis melo_ var. _reticulatus_) and in open fields for the cultivation
of winter melon (_C. melo_ var. _inodorus_). 50 per cent of the visited
farms in the area of Cagliari were infected. BPYV is transmitted in the
semi-persistent manner by the greenhouse whitefly (_Trialeurodes
vaporariorum_; _Aleyrodidae_). The host range of BPYV includes several crop
species such as beet (_Beta vulgaris_), lettuce (_Lactuca sativa_), endive
(_Cichorium endiva_), shepherd's purse (_Capsella bursa-pastoris__),
cucumber (_Cucumis sativus_), dandelion (_Taraxacum officinale_), and
poison hemlock (_Conium maculatum_). These plants are natural hosts of
BPYV, and I would not be surprised if the virus were to become established
in one or more of these plant species. The virus is reported in Australia
(Tasmania), France, Japan, the Netherlands, and the USA (California). I
thank Laura Tomassoli for providing information on the extent of the BPYV
outbreak. - Mod.DH]
