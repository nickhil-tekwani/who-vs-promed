The Ministry of Health in Kenya has confirmed that the suspected
outbreak of a viral haemorrhagic fever in Garissa in the North
Eastern Province is due to Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV). Results
from KEMRI (The Kenya Medical Research Institute) laboratories have
confirmed that the samples sent from the Provincial General Hospital
(PGH) in Garissa were positive. The RVFV specific IgM titers were
positive as well as [results obtained] using PCR. There have been 11
deaths in Garissa District and at least 6 patients have been admitted
to the PGH in Garissa. Two of the deaths occurred in the hospital.
The area has been affected by floods due to heavy rains since the end
of November and many parts of the district are inaccessible by road.
All cases were in herdsman aged between 20 and 30 years. The symptoms
included headache, fever, myalgia and bleeding tendencies.
There have been no deaths reported in abattoir workers or butchers.
Results from sentinel surveillance sites at PGH Garissa also show
evidence of past infection as evidenced by presence of RVFV specific
IgG; this may indicate exposure to the virus during the 1997-1998
outbreak. Entomological studies indicate increased densities of both
anopheles and aedes mosquitoes in Garissa District and the
neighbouring Ijara District.
There are reports of deaths occurring in areas of Southern Somalia
bordering Kenya with patients presenting with similar symptoms,
however it has not been possible to obtain blood samples from
patients in Somalia. It is difficult to estimate the number of deaths
in livestock in the area because of the inaccessible roads. Air
transport has been used to evacuate people stranded in floods and to
evacuate patients in inaccessible areas. The Ministry of Livestock
has banned movement of livestock from the province and is starting a
campaign to vaccinate all cattle in the area.
The Ministry of Health with UNICEF and WHO have sent
insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) for distribution for all the people
and chemicals for indoor residual spraying (IRS). Distribution of ITN
has been difficult because most of the areas are inaccessible due to
heavy rains and it may be difficult to conduct IRS in all areas
because of the nomadic life style of the population and the fact that
most of the areas are inaccessible.

[Dr Sharif's statement reports the results of laboratory tests
(serology and PCR) confirming the involvement of Rift Valley fever
virus in the outbreak of hemorrhagic fever in the North Eastern
Province of Kenya. There are unconfirmed reports also of human cases
of Rift Valley fever to the east of Garissa in the southern region of
Somalia.
Epizootics of Rift Valley fever are generally observed during years
in which unusually heavy rainfall and localized flooding occur. The
excessive rainfall allows mosquito eggs, usually of the genus
_Aedes_, to hatch. The mosquito eggs are naturally infected with the
Rift Valley fever virus, and the resulting mosquitoes transfer the
virus to the livestock on which they feed. Once livestock (cattle,
sheep and goats) are infected, other species of mosquitoes can become
infected from these animals and can spread the disease. In addition,
it is possible that the virus can be transmitted by other biting
insects. Humans can become infected as a result of bites from
mosquitoes and possibly other bloodsucking insects that serve as
vectors.
Humans can also get the disease if they are exposed to either the
blood or other body fluids of infected animals. This exposure can
result from the slaughtering or handling of infected animals or by
touching contaminated meat during the preparation of food. In the
Garissa outbreak, the detection of IgG antibody in abattoir workers
and butchers, in the absence of disease, may indicate that the virus
has been present in insect vectors in this region undetected for some
time. In general humans are less susceptible to severe disease than
domestic animals. Humans typically have either no symptoms or a mild
illness associated with fever and liver abnormalities. However, in
some patients the illness can progress to hemorrhagic fever (which
can lead to shock or hemorrhage), encephalitis (inflammation of the
brain, which can lead to headaches, coma, or seizures), or ocular
disease (diseases affecting the eye).
Patients who become ill usually experience fever, generalized
weakness, back pain, dizziness, and extreme weight loss at the onset
of the illness. Typically, patients recover within 2 days to one week
after onset of illness. The most common complication associated with
RVF is inflammation of the retina. As a result, 1-10 percent of
affected patients may have some permanent vision loss. - Mod.CP]
[Circulating RVF virus, anywhere, is bad news; its current timing and
location in Somali is particularly of concern. This, in view of the
approaching Eid ul-Adha (Eyd-e Qorban, the islamic Festival of
Sacrifice), which marks the end of the pilgrimage or Hajj for the
milions of Muslims who make the trip to Mecca. Eid ul-Adha is 4 days
long. Muslims who can afford to do so may sacrifice domestic animals,
usually sheep, as a symbol of Ibrahim's sacrifice; this sacrifice is
called "Qurban." This occurs throughout the Muslim world; the numbers
of ritually slaughtered animals takes on huge dimensions in Mecca.
This year's Eid is due between 31 Dec 2006 to 2 Jan 2007. The animal
health and public health authorities in the relevant countries have
to exercise enhanced alertness to prevent the inclusion of infected
ruminants among the animals transported for slaughter. This relates
particularly to Saudi Arabia, where the virus has been circulating
since the late 90s, probably introduced from the Horn of Africa, and
where millions (!) of sheep and goats, as well as large numbers of
cattle, are to be slaughtered during the Eid. Human infections,
following their exposure to infected blood droplets produced during
home slaughtering, were recorded during the RVF outbreak in Egypt in
1977-78. - Mod. AS]
