The moderator commented about my statements in the Nature News Blog [ProMED archive 20120501.1119136]. As I read the post, it appears to me that the reporter characterized my comments correctly. I have included the transmissions mentioned and references for these. This is not meant to be all-inclusive, and it does not explain the complexities of these studies.

- L-type BSE inoculated intracerebrally and intraperitoneally transmitted to transgenic mice overexpressing bovine PrP on a murine PrP knockout background (Tgbov XV) (Capobianco et al., 2007)
- L-type BSE inoculated intracerebrally transmitted to transgenic ovinized mice expressing the VRQ allele (Beringue et al., 2007).
- L-type BSE inoculated intracerebrally transmitted to mice transgenic for human PrP Met129 (Beringue et. al., 2008 - In this study H type was reported not to show evidence of transmission)
- L-type BSE transmitted to cynomolgus macaque intracerebrally (Comoy et. al., 2008)
- L-type BSE transmitted to mouse lemurs both intracerebrally and orally (Mestre-Frances et. al., 2012)
- L-type and H-type transmitted to wild-type mice intracerebrally (Wilson et.al. 2012)
- H-type BSE has transmitted intracerebrally to transgenic mice expressing ovine and bovine PrP (Beringue et. al., 2006; Buschmann et.al., 2006; Torres et. al., 2011)

It should be noted that the studies listed above represent atypical BSE isolates transmitted to a range of models including wild-type mice, transgenic mice overexpressing PrP from different species at different levels, on a variety of genetic backgrounds, and nonhuman primates. A very recent project (Wilson et. al., 2012) performed a comparison of the neuropathological and molecular properties of all 3 BSE agents (BASE, BSE-C and BSE-H) upon transmission into the same gene-targeted transgenic mouse line expressing the bovine prion protein (Bov6) and a wild-type control of the same genetic background. The results differed from observations made with the other models.

Care must be taken in interpreting all of these findings. To repeat another statement I made, it is important for regulatory authorities to keep current with research and epidemiological findings and modify current policies as needed.

[It is completely agreed that interpretation of the research can be a challenge. Intracerebral modeling in other species, especially monogastric species (like mice) may have a different mechanism of prion development compared with oral ingestion by ruminant animals (e.g., cows). The inoculation mechanism (intracerebral vs. oral ingestion) as well as the physiologic differences between mice (or other monogastrastric species) and cattle (or other ruminant species) is also not completely comparable.

It should never be assumed that the interpretation of data in non-human primates is the same as for humans. However, non-human primates are closely related to humans and the physiological leap is not as far as the example in the previous paragraph.

We appreciate Dr. Detwiler providing the additional summation and references. - Mod.TG]

Two farms have been quarantined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) as the agency continues to investigate last month's [April 2012] discovery of mad cow disease at a California dairy farm.

Authorities also have launched an investigation at a calf ranch where the initial infected cow was raised 10 years ago, according to a statement released late Wednesday [2 May 2012] by the USDA.

Last week, the USDA documented the 4th confirmed U.S. case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) -- a brain wasting disease affecting cattle -- known commonly as mad cow disease, at a rendering facility in central California. USDA officials said the cow was never presented for human consumption and was not a threat.

The farm where the cow was initially discovered has been under quarantine since the discovery, agriculture officials said. Wednesday's [2 May 2012] announcement of a 2nd quarantine involves a farm closely associated with the dairy where the sick cow was discovered last month [April 2012], the USDA said. The agency is still trying to determine whether any at-risk cattle are present at either of the 2 farms.

Eating contaminated meat or some other animal products from cattle that have BSE is thought to be the cause of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). The fatal brain disease was blamed for the deaths of 150 people in Britain, where there was an outbreak in the 1980s and 1990s.

In people, symptoms of the disease include psychiatric and behavioral changes, movement deficits, memory disturbances and cognitive impairments.

BSE can cause infected animals to display nervousness or aggression, difficulty in coordination and standing up, decreased milk production or weight loss.

It is usually transmitted between cows through the practice of recycling bovine carcasses for meat and bone meal protein, which is fed to other cattle.

In this case, the USDA reported that the cow had a rare form of BSE not likely carried by contaminated feed.

Since 2004, the USDA has removed the brain and the spinal column, the parts suspected of causing mad cow disease in humans, from the food system.

The USDA says since the discovery of the infected cow, they have identified 10 different feed suppliers that delivered animal feed to the farm. Determining whether the cow became sick from feed is an area where investigators are focusing close attention.

Authorities have determined the infected cow gave birth twice. One calf was stillborn, and the other was located on a farm outside of California. That cow was subsequently euthanized and tested negative for mad cow disease.

Unlike most other meat-borne illnesses, such as those caused by _E. coli_ bacteria, cooking does not kill the infectious agent that causes mad cow disease.

Consumers who wish to exercise extra caution can follow the advice presented by the Web-based consumer advocacy group Consumeraffairs.com, which advises the avoidance of brains, neck bones and beef cheeks, bone marrow and cuts of beef that are sold on the bone. The group also says to choose boneless cuts of meat and ground beef only if it has been ground in the store.

"Evidence shows that our systems and safeguards to prevent BSE are working, as are similar actions taken by countries around the world," said John Clifford, the Agriculture Department's chief veterinarian.

Last year [2011], 29 cases of BSE were reported worldwide, down 99 percent from the peak of 37 311 cases in 1992.

"This is directly attributable to the impact and effectiveness of feed bans as a primary control measure for the disease," he said last month [April 2012].

The USDA confirmed the 1st case of mad cow disease in America on 23 Dec 2003 in a cow born in Alberta, Canada in April 1997, only 4 months before the United States and Canada began banning the use of brain and spinal cord tissue in cattle feed.

A 2nd U.S. case was confirmed on 24 Jun 2005, and a 3rd on 13 Mar 2006.

[It appears this disease is being handled no differently than any other regulated disease. The officials are tracing the movement of the animals and exercising an abundance of caution. Keeping the food chain as safe as possible is the goal. - Mod.TG
